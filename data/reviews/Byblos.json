{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good menu, nice flavours - although a side step away from authentic, however they work, so kudo's to the chef.

Fun place to have a drink and snack on mezzes, or, try a variety of main dishes.

Reasonably priced.  Good location in entertainment district."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Really loved the beats in yogurt.

You will need a reservation and you should plan 2-3 weeks ahead.

Despite being upscale, the price point is very reasonable.

Halal is available for parties when you call ahead."}
{"text":"For such an upscale place, we were stunned at how little the bill came to even though we'd stuffed ourselves. Delicious supper for four people including desserts came to just over $160 including tip. 

How is that possible? Well, it would have been more but I was the only one drinking and kept it to just one glass of wine so I wouldn't look like a lush next to the teetotalers. Broke my heart because the menu is filled with great looking cocktails including a Date Old Fashioned. Next time it will be mine.

Service was attentive but casual. The food was top notch -- I'm coming back for more as soon as I can."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin!? I still have dreams of Turkish Dumplings from my night at Byblos. One of the most unique restaurants in the city! 
I asked to be seated in the lower dining room on my reservation which was gladly accommodated. The interior of the restaurant is beautifully designed, with a modern take of Mediterranean aesthetics and visual elements creating a wonderfully intimate ambiance. 
I started with the Cheese Acharuli and my partner with the Steak Tartare. Both of which were delicious entryways to the main show - I got the BC Mussels and my partner, the Turkish Manti Dumplings. I wasn't told that the mussels would come in that big of a serving! However they were absolutely delectable, but the dish that stole the spotlight were the dumplings. Just divine! I would go back just for those.
The only downside was the service, our server was not very attentive, knowledgeable nor friendly. There was some confusion near the end of our meal where he was leaving and swapped with another server - the manner of which exacerbated his poor behaviour. 
However, I am happy to put the shortcomings of the service aside since the food along with the ambiance of the restaurant were simply unforgettable."}
{"text":"Visited Byblos for a second time because impressed with the quality of food and service. 4 stars to the branzino, Turkish manti dumplings, and steak tartare.

Definitely going back again and again!"}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants ever. SOOOOOO expensive and portions are s0o0o0o0 small but it is SO good. Honestly. So. Good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very polite and knowledgeable staff (she suggested we change our order to have better pairings and boy was she right!). The food is expensive, but worth it. We were on a date, and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, so we actually took some home."}
{"text":"Summary: Amazing. I had visited the one in Miami before (which was also fantastically) and had been wanting to try out the Toronto location. Flavourful, unexpected delights. 

Roasted beets (labneh): this is a labneh that is served with crispy bread. The labneh is wonderful -- the beets add subtle sweetness, and the yogurt is smooth. The bread is well-toasted, so crispy on the outside but soft to the bite. A wonderful combination

Middle Eastern crispy chicken: love, love, love. Fried SO well. Melt-in-your-mouth kind of dish, and the hot sauce adds a subtle yet important flavour. 

Black cod: this was a bit of a disappointment. The fish is wrapped around vine leaves, which are burnt.    I thought that the burnt flavour was too overpowering. 

Sweet jeweled rice: a must!! Thin crispy carrots on top, and just a great mix of ingredients. So good. 

Dessert: crispy qqatayef: as the name suggests, these are fried. Very sweet, with a side of strawberries. They were quite good, and I had to finish them even though I was full. 

Can't wait to come back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable.  Food was really delicious.  Went with a sizeable group, so we were able to try a lot of things on the menu, which was great.  

The only negative is that the restaurant was out of the wine we wanted (not a problem), but the substitute that they recommended and provided was expensive and not good."}
{"text":"Great great place and delicious food. 
This place took it to the next level when it comes to middle eastern cuisine. Don't know even where to start what to recommend. I suggest to go there min 6 pips and just do the sharing menu. The place is always busy and hard to get reservation. Anyway.- must go."}
{"text":"one word, AMAZING!

Service: our server was great! He explained the menu very well since it was our first time here. He suggested ordering 8 plates to share between the four of us.
He was super friendly and attentive! 
The hostess however, she was busy answering calls so I waited quite a bit till she got off the phone. She then just pointed me in the direction of where my friends were sitting. I realized no one had their jackets on their chair, but she never asked to take mine so I had to keep my big winter coat and my scarf on the chair which kept falling off the chair. 

Food: Every dish was Wow! The flavours were beyond me especially since it was my first time having eastern Mediterranean food. I loved the use of different spices in each dish. If you appreciate food with lots of flavour, you will definitely love this spot. 

We ordered the:
ORGANIC HOUSE LABNEH- this bread was a bit tough to bite on but dipped into the yogurt & olive oil ... perfection
Eggplant Kibeh- must try!
Crispy Squid- best squid ever
Fattouche- it was so fresh and yummy. 
Spanish Octopus- my first time having Octopus so I couldn't compare. The sauce they served it with went really well.
Slow braised Lamb Shoulder- Must try
Sabzi Rice with herbs- it was so good, you could eat it on its own.
Oxtail- Must try


The ambience was perfect. Dimmed lighting. Beautiful bar, light fixtures, the decor was lovely. I was surprised to hear the music, but I liked that. 

Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Finally checked out Byblos on a Friday night! 

First off the food is very tasty! Great flavours and items to choose from. Portions are a little small so try and order accordingly. I went with one other person and we got 3 small plates and 2 larger and we probably could have gone for another dish to be completely satisfied. However, the waiter did suggest that we get 6 - should have listened to him. 

The service was good. Our waiter was very friendly. Our small plates arrived very quickly, however, our larger plates took a little longer, but not long enough to really complain about. 

My only complaint about this place is the hostess...RUDE RUDE RUDE. 

We unfortunately arrived late for our reservation, due to traffic. I had called and left a message as it went straight to voicemail and called a few times after that but got sent straight to voicemail again. Once we arrived the hostess with her bright blue long hair and goth lipstick told us that she had given our table away because we took too long. I explained to her that I had called and left a message because I had been sent directly to voicemail. Another hostess comes by and the blue haired girl tells her the situation and says that I \"claim\" to have left a voicemail with her snotty attitude. She then turns to me and says that they will see if they can get me another table upon which I asked how long that might takes, she then turns around and snaps \"I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I CHECK\". I was floored. It was actually disgusting and appalling. Why girls in the service industry have so much attitude is beyond me. 

Because of this one person's atrocious attitude I will NOT be returning to Byblos. Hopefully they hire better behaved staff members that properly present themselves in public."}
{"text":"Loved it here. Lots of variety on the menu, and the bartender's awesome attitude made it feel like home. The burnt honey ice cream didn't hurt, either."}
{"text":"This was a good meal. 

The environment already won me over with the Turkish lamps lavished across the open kitchen.    We started with the bread appetizers- toasted bread already lightly soaked in olive oil and generously topped with sesame seeds.   I had to resist finishing my piece to save room for our later dishes!

We ordered the following 

Duck kibbeh - this reminded me of a falafel but made of bulgur wheat and stuffed with duck.  The tahini sauce that came with it was the star of the dish and I wish I had more to dip not only with the kibbeh but with the other dishes!

Tuna - the squid ink chips definitely made our table go 'ooo and ahh'.  But this wasn't an all star dish and the jalapeno dressing overpowered all other flavours that were incorporated into the tuna.  

Vine ripened tomato - MY FAVOURITE PLATE OF THE EVENING.   who knew tomatoes could taste so divine?   To my fellow diners - sorry if I consumed most of this dish that was supposed to be shared

Black Cod- wrapped in vine leaves - this dish wasn't bad either but i think the fish was a bit overcooked since it was a bit dry. 

Seared Cauliflower- again byblos has somehow made another humble vegetable an outstanding star.  It was also another favourite at the table - again that tahini sauce was amazing and went so well with the charred flavour of the cauliflower. 

Crispy Confit Duck - yes so our table seemed to have a tad predisposition to duck - but to be fair the true star was the rice .   There was a myriad of flavours and textures from just one bite: crispy (from the duck shreds); crunchy (almonds); sweet from the molasses and cinnamon.  and if you are looking to spend less at this restaurant without sacrificing quality and flavour, this would be the one to order! 

The service was attentive and our waitress kindly accommodated allergies at the table by recommending alternative dishes on the menu.  Although not all the dishes were outstanding (interestingly both fish plates were the letdowns of the meal), I still highly recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere to impress/ unique/ upscale Mediterranean in the city."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere. Service was great. Would return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"When I first came to Byblos late last year, I had heard so much about it from trusted foodie friends that I was concerned it would not match inflated expectations:  it surpassed them.  Have been there twice since, and each time we had superb culinary experiences.  So why is Byblos so good?  All the food is spectacularly flavoured and decadent.  Spices, herbs, textures are combined into what feels familiar and novel, comforting and eclectic.  The clear Middle Eastern influences, dishes, and spices are recognizable, but flavours explode with a pallet that's 100 times brighter than any other Middle Eastern cuisine I've tried.  Crispy Eggplant, Duck Kibbeh, Tuna Ceviche, Marcona Almonds, Fig Salad are favourite starters.  Slow Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder is good for four to share and is fall off the bone insanely delicious, the best lamb I've ever tasted.  The downtown location (near theatre district) and décor are excellent, and the wine cellar is extensive.  Service is superb.  Overall this is now my favourite restaurant in Toronto and you owe it to your taste buds to give Byblos a try."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here last Thursday without a reservation.  We were given a table on the second floor and I'm really happy about that as I felt it was much more unique than the first floor.  Second floor's decor is really thoughtful and the space and walls are orginals which is great with the old-school detail you just don't see any more.  The window treatments and the floor dividers were artistic and something I'd never seen before.  We ordered the following: 
Crispy Eggplant
Duck Kibbeh
Spanish Octopus
Crispy Squid
Hand rolled Couscous

They were all amazing - my dinner partner and I had a tough time picking which was our favourite - they all were.  Buuuuut I will say that the Octopus made me swoon - it was fabulous.  And I felt the timing of the dishes being brought to our table was perfect.  I would have loved to enjoyed the cocktail menu as it was fabulously original, but we opted for red wine instead.

Our server Cindy was FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS.  We were having a slow catch-up dinner and she made us feel like we were welcome to stay all night long and her pace and attentiveness was spot on.  I liked how the rest of the servers were very good at stepping in for one another when needed.

We split the bill down the middle and with our dishes, 1 glass of wine for me, 2 glasses for my dinner guest and tea for both of us, our individual bills came to just under $70 before tip.  I felt the evening was well worth the bill...the food was just that amazing!  Kudos to the kitchen.

I liked this place so much, I am going back again this evening!  I'm so happy Toronto has a place with such inventive and authentic foods...brings back memories of my trip to Egypt."}
{"text":"If you want to get cultured, you will LOVE it here. 

It was a visually indulging experience and stimulated all your senses. Even if you are of a Mediterranean background, every bite is new and exiting exploding with beautiful flavour. Everything was plated so elegantly using lots of floral detailing, service was exceptional, ambience was dark and cozy, and you feel truly immersed in such a delicious adventure. We brought some food home and it just wasn't the same - something about it is ultra inviting and different from any other place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, unbeatable service. Soo glad that we found hidden gem with yelp.

My friend declared this place \"the king of food place in Toronto.\" Location was easy to get to and the food was terrific, a lot of variety so everyone in the family can find something they like. (I strongly recommend trying out their special!) The staff is very friendly and accommodating. 

I'm looking forward to coming here again but this time to try out their stuff on the menu!  Everything seems soo teasty, I want to try them all."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. We came here on a Saturday night without a reservation, which resulted in us sitting at the bar for dinner - what a stroke of luck! Clayton Cooper the head mixologist for the group that owns Byblos wound up serving us. We had the tuna ceviche and the roasted red beets as starters, my wife had the duck kibbeh (a starter) as her main, and I had the Branzino (Mediterranean sea bass) with eggplant kimchee on top, which was fantastic. Great menu, lots of dishes you won't see elsewhere. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I went with my friend on good Friday... It wasn't busy, according to their usual friday nights but I was happy to have gone there for the first time without any hassles of the busy crowd. 

My friend and I ordered:
- Organic house labneh 
- lamb ribs
- turkish manta dumplings 
- sweet jewelled basmati rice

I loved it all! Although, the dumplings were a little disappointing, as I didn't taste anything eggplant... and if I were blind folded eating the dumplings, I could've mistakenly thought they were perogies. Other than that, I really loved the rice, labneh and ribs. Well done! 

Our drinks were fantastic. We had the goulab plus something similar to amaretto sour (can't remember the name). When ordering the goulab, drink it asap as it isn't ideal to stretch it out during a conversation. After all, I went with my girlfriend and spent a long time talking. 
 
Our server Mary was super fantastic! She really takes care of you and can happily assist you with the menu. The overall service, food and ambience was very memorable and I excited to take my hubby there soon!"}
{"text":"We loved our experience at Byblos - it had great atmosphere, the service was excellent and the food was delicious. Everything was done well right down to the fine details. 

We had: 
- organic house kibbeh 
- lamb ribs
- spanish octopus 
- turkish manti dumpings
- tartufata 
- turkish coffee
- turkish coffee chocolate sorbet 

Everything we had was very flavourful but the standout dish for us was the tartufata. They warned us that it is cooked per order and takes about 30 minutes, but the wait was worth it! The mushroom flavour was decadent and fried chickpeas gave an interesting texture to each bite.

I don't want to be nitpicky but I feel I should point out that a couple of the plates the food was served on were chipped. I understand these beautiful plates must be expensive but for a restaurant of this caliber, they should be careful with that! 

All in all, I would love to come back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food and service. 

If you're looking for something special and modern Middle Eastern, don't hesitate!"}
{"text":"I'd been hearing about this place for a while and finally had a chance to try it. Our server was attentive and did a great job explaining both the food and drinks menu. I started with the Rose Gulab and shared the Aviator tea service with my 3 friends. The Rose Gulab was delicious and the tea service was something unique.

We ordered about 9 or 10 dishes and my favourites were the Spanish octopus and the grilled whole branzino. But everything we ordered was tasty and well presented. It's a good idea to go with a group, so you can order lots of dishes and try a bit of everything. 

We were impressed and I know I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"A total rip of - I honestly will not go there again.

The rice dish we ordered has a weird flavour that I can't recall having it at any Middle East restaurant, taste like paella smoked Ina mixed of Indian herbs.  Very pricy menu for very mediocre food."}
{"text":"Great experience! Loved the decor of both floors, and ambience.  Went with a friend but saw lots of different groups there.  Would easily be a good place for a date or work dinner.  Staff were all very nice and super attentive.  Server had great recommendations.  We ordered a couple of tasty cocktails, the roasted red beets, fig salad, black truffle pide, the lamb shoulder and the cauliflower.  Lamb shoulder was my favourite.  Like a fancy shawarma!  Was definitely full and had leftovers to take home.  Slightly overpriced, but great flavours and service.  Would still recommend it!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Absolutely amazing service. Had the lebneh (which was okay, a bit bland for me personally), the fig salad, the fluke and the jeweled basmati rice (all extremely delicious and I highly recommend)."}
{"text":"As a local Torontonian, I find that restaurants in Toronto are plentiful. However, when it comes to their decor, it is almost as if they try too hard to say \"look at how wonderful our space is!\" and then lack on continuity when it comes to the food.

Byblos is a fusion of Middle Eastern Food, yes. The decor is very modern with a vintage feel as if you're in an upscale New York members only bar. With rustic wall art and half circle benches, it is pretty neat to see how it is decorated but there is no Middle Eastern feel. 

We were greeted by our server who was courtesy. One of the my biggest pet peeves however is when you enter a restaurant in Toronto and are advised once seated that the menu is tapas style. This to me translates to \"We serve you less portions but charge you more.\" which is pretty much what we encountered.

The server did advise us on how the menu worked and made suggestions on how much to order for our party. To me, this is a turn off as now we are ordering more smaller dishes to share as opposed to just ordering what we wanted. Nonetheless, the food was well presented and very tasty, but, portions were small.

The entrees themselves, were very big. A friend ordered the Red Snapper which I have to admit, was really good and I do not eat fish at all. The Cornish Hen is plentiful and that can be shared with 3 people for sure. This would have been helpful to have been advised instead of ordering so many smaller tapas styles items.

In addition, one turn off as well is that the kitchen staff come out to serve the food and advise what the food is. On our night, it was very loud and we could not hear the chefs at all

If you are dining with 2 people, with appetizers, a drink each, main, dessert and a tip, expect to pay over $100 for sure. Byblos is a great place for celebrating an event, great first date, if you're in Toronto and want to splurge but if you're traveling and are watching your wallet, I would suggest other establishments."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from the US and always like to try local restaurants when we travel.  We just loved this place.  The waiter was so helpful in suggesting which small plates went with which...he was spot on.  The roasted beets, lamb ribs and octopus were dynamite together.  My husband had the BC mussels and I had the fluke.  My husband said they were the best mussels he had ever had.  Finished up dinner with Turkish coffee and dessert.  We had read reviews about the noise level.  The restaurant was almost at capacity and we didn't find the noise level excessive at all.  This is definitely on our \"return to\" list the next time we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this restaurant (lauded as one of the best in Toronto), I booked this place to celebrate my mom's birthday. Be sure to make a reservation at least a week in advance if you want to eat during peak dinner hours.

We entered the Eastern Mediterranean restaurant through an unassuming, black shelter and the hostess promptly led us to a round booth on the second floor. I appreciated the funky light fixtures around the room. It feels like a lounge with the ambient lighting and fancy bar on the side. Since opening two years ago, Byblos seems to have maintained a steady flow of regular customers while attracting new diners, as the place was packed. 

We started with Roasted Red Beets, Eggplant Kibbeh, and Tuna Ceviche. The beets were flavourful and the labneh (yogurt) was rich and creamy, however the accompanying barbari bread was over-toasted and rock hard. I liked how the kibbeh was crispy without being oily. The squid ink chips were fun to eat with the tuna ceviche, which was served in a small bowl over ice. Loved the refreshing sauce and the cubes of avocado. 

Next up, we had the Turkish Manti Dumplings, Mejadra Rice, and Lamb Ribs with a side of Roasted Brussel Sprouts. My family is accustomed to the taste of Chinese dumplings and Japanese gyoza, but the baked manti surprisingly tasted so good with the yogurt sauce. We all agreed that the manti dish was the highlight of the evening. The rice was spiced perfectly and the fried shallots' flavour was fully infused. The lamb, which was coated with dukkah, gave the tender meat an interesting texture. My mom normally doesn't like lamb but she enjoyed the ribs because they tasted a little sweet and not too gamey. We polished off the brussel sprouts (had hints of cheese) in record time so I definitely recommend ordering that as a side!

For dessert, we ordered the Yogurt Mousse. I recommend eating a bit of each of the four components all in one bite. The dense pistachio cake and the sourness of the pomegranate molasses balances out the floral notes of the jam and sweetness of the Persian cotton candy. 

Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable but towards the end of the night, we had trouble finding him to get the bill. The prices are on the higher side for the portions, but I think for the quality, they're reasonable. Love the tapas concept (we all tried a bit of every dish) and left feeling comfortably full. Overall, a unique dining experience and managed to impress my mom!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. Only downside is that the washrooms are downstairs and my MIL had a bit of a hard time. THE FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE---if you like lamb- yes, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Aline our server was AMAZING! Great atmosphere, the food was superb. I really really recommend Byblos! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been twice and my second experience was definitely better.  Maybe we didn't order enough food the first time around, or maybe we ordered more drinks.  But my first experience ended with me hungry at the end of the meal and a huge bill.  I also found the service pretentious the first time around.  My second experience was better.  I didn't leave with the same hungry feeling, possibly because we ordered more carbs - i.e., rice.  The service was also better on the second visit; our waiter was friendly and gave good recommendations.  Both times, the food was flavourful...but the portions were small (expected) and expensive.  The drinks are also pricey - our group had wine and it was a challenge to find a bottle that wouldn't break the bank.  I wouldn't tell someone to avoid this place, but I also couldn't guarantee that you'd love it if you went..."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! try everything they go there with lamb! omg and order the lamb ribs for appetizer. I found the flavours are very unique for me at least but they all worked so good! put western flavors to shame! haha"}
{"text":"Unique food. beautiful decor. Beautiful flavors and presentation. 
Great place for an special after work meal."}
{"text":"Had a great time and great food!  We sat at the bar for food and drinks.  We let the bartender, Robin, order everything for us.  Everything he put in front of us was top notch!  Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  We were there as a large group of 20+ people so had a set menu which was fabulous.  Flavours were incredible, service amazing, and the cocktails were yum!  Would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city that never disappoints. I know I can recommend Byblos to anyone and that they will have a great experience. Favs are the duck kibbeh, short ribs, the cod, middle eastern fried chicken, and to drink The Gulaab!"}
{"text":"Came here for my husband birthday on a Saturday night and we enjoyed ourselves, so it's a win with an infant at home, happy getting a babysitter was worth it!

We were seated on the second floor, corner table by the kitchen, gave us a good view of the restaurant to people watch. The crowd was a little bit older than expected. Vibe was good and background music was great. Server was attentive, until near the end, when a larger party was seated beside us. 

Drinks: hubby got a on tap negroni, and while the other cocktails looked interesting, I went with a virgin garoub, which was syrupy, but nice. He also got two glasses of white wine. 

Food: 
Beets appetizer - was really a labneh (house made yogurt with honey) with a sprinkling of beets. But the labneh and bread was great on its own.  
Brussels spouts - with haloumi (one of my faves), was a pleasant side
Majedra rice - awesome. You have to get a rice, any rice. 
Branzino fish - the most expensive item, but most disappointing. Wrapped in grape leaves, but was relatively bland. The eggplants topping was the best part though. 

It was more than enough for the two of us, so we actually skipped dessert, but each got an herbal tea, which was served in nice Turkish glasses and was a nice finish. 

Total bill before tip was $150. We would return to try out more small plates and sides."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best meal I've had in Toronto, ever. Our server, Joel, understands the science of flavours and gave us exceptional recommendations."}
{"text":"My favourite was the pistachio yogurt mousse...I could eat five of these!  Came here with friends who are in the food scene for dinner twice in one week! I have to mention that the service at this restaurant is great!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and had a wonderful meal both times. The food is fantastic.

The black cod and truffle-haloumi bread were both delicious, as was everything else we tried. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"When you walk into this restaurant, the decor is nice and upscale and pulls in you right in!

We were a party of 5 so with the relatively small menu, we pretty much tried everything on it - definitely made all our tummys happy. The lamb was exceptionally tender and good that we ordered 2 plates. 

Their cocktails/drinks were also very good. I believe I had their version of the old fashioned.

Overall, well done!!"}
{"text":"A great spot if you're looking for something different. I've never been disappointed with the food, cocktails or service here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very popular and I recommend making reservation before going. Food is not so so, but portion is extremely small. It costs us $150 for two people for dinner. It is an interesting experience but I would not go back.

I recommend the Fig salad and Rib."}
{"text":"What can I say about Byblos? Possibly my favorite dining experience ever, even better than Splendido and Gramercy Tavern in NYC (my next favorites...now).

The hostess was very pleasant and helpful, our server was  efficient and very personable, and the manager James was a great host, checking in often to see how we were doing. Top notch service in every way!

The food...wow. We started with a very nice salad and a fantastic artichoke and yogurt dish (I don't even like artichoke) that we devoured. 

Next, succulent lamb ribs with a coriander based (I think) crust on them that is similar to the excellent bread that they serve. Delicious!

Wagyu beef on a cauliflower hummus that just bursts with flavor in every bite. Cooked perfectly and seasoned according to the rich fat of the wagyu to combine for the perfect bite of steak, IMO. 

A creamy lobster dish, some exceptional short ribs and some phenomenal Israeli couscous (and Brussels sprouts with haloumi cheese and bacon!!!) and we were pretty much stuffed, but James the host also provided us with three small desserts that were also fantastic. 

We also had one of their chilled alcoholic teas, and wow, does that ever finish a meal off perfectly. 

Can't say enough about our experience at Byblos. My wife and I are now presented with the challenge deciding how long we should wait before going back. We love trying new restos and don't like to overdo one spot, but I don't think we can wait much longer!"}
{"text":"Lovely decor, great servers and, most importantly, delicious and interesting food. The only down-ish side to my meal was the fish; but It's rare I'm impressed by fish so don't judge bases on that. The highlights for me was the lamb, the duck kibbeh and the cauliflower. The steak was well-loved at our table as well."}
{"text":"we dined on the upper floor of this restaurant, and I gotta say it was AMAZING. I had the lamb, which was probably one of the most flavourful dishes I've ever had. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Très beau restaurant avec ambiance feutrée, pas trop bruyante...
Bon, plutôt excellent!
Belles présentations.
Un coup de coeur et je veux y retourner!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving to try one of North America's underrepresented cuisines at Byblos, and we were not disappointed. All of us were blown away by the exotic decor of this restaurant with beautifully appointed Mediterranean blue motifs. Starting off with a cocktail, my friend and I had the gulab which is a modern interpretation of the traditional Persian gulab sharbat. For hor d'oeuvres we had roasted red beets which was mediocre as I was expecting more char from the beets but the labneh was silky with a touch of herbs and honey. The barbari bread was crispy and piping hot and the spices played great with the texture. Next, we had the duck kibbeh which was well-balanced with the spice of sumac and cumin, ensuring that the natural flavour of duck is maintained. 

One of the great stand out dishes would be the lamb ribs crusted with a thick crunchy layer of dukkah that plays out the beautiful gaminess of the lamb. For the adventurous palate, you can try some of the carob molasses which has a touch of sweetness with the depth of chocolate that pairs perfectly with lamb. An alternative interpretation of the dish would be drizzle some Yemeni-inspired red chilli schug which is a garlicky condiment that adds some zest and heat to the strongly-flavoured game meat. 

The Turkish manti dumpling dish was a crowd-favourite with the addictive thyme based yogurt sauce and the drizzled molasses on top of the dumplings gave them a tinge of sweetness. The dumplings were perfectly cooked and the stuffing of smokey eggplant was so delicious which surprised my non-vegetarian friends who were expecting something else. I was recommended to order the basmati rice to accompany the dumpling dish, and the rice had a great variety of texture from the fried shallots to dried fruits. 

Dessert was simply an unforgettable sequence of delectable triumphs starting with the burnt honey ice cream with the crunch piece of honeycomb for texture. Next on the dessert list would be the crispy qatayef which was basically fried dough stuffed with spiced cream and laced with delicious honeyed syrup and strawberry with sumac - perfect with a nice cold beer! The brik pastry cigar intrigued us with its play on the turkish sigara boregi which wasn't as spectacular as we were expecting. However, the piece de resistance and the crown jewel of the chef's dessert menu would be the pistachio cake infused with orange blossom water and yogurt mousse topped with Persian cotton candy."}
{"text":"I would go back, actually I have gone back!  Great dishes, good for sharing, fantastic take on mediterranean/middle eastern food. 
We had the roasted beets, duck kibbeh (least fave), lamb ribs (uh--yum!), hamachi (also yum), black truffle bread (really yum especially if you like truffle), slow braised lamb shoulder (melt in your mouth), black cod, fig salad.  
Ambiance was good.  I liked the decor.  Wine selection was good.  
I enjoyed both my experiences."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner at Byblos on Saturday night. The place was very busy, good thing that we made reservations. We were seated on the main floor and the tables there did seem fairly close together - we could hear details of all conversations going around us. At least until they started playing music that was really loud. Service was not overly friendly but prompt and efficient. Food was fantastic. I loved the mix of Middle Eastern, Indian, North African, Indian spices - they used them quite liberally and the result was amazing. After reading other Yelp reviews we ordered manti dumplings, fig salad, and cornish hen, everything tasted great and cooked to perfection. The wines were a bit expensive but worth the money. This would be a 5 star review if not for a very loud and lousy music - they should really replace a DJ."}
{"text":"Escellent. Good food and wine priced decently for downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent food and amazing drinks. The atmosphere was perfect. The service was outstanding. Definitely one of the best places to have a romantic dinner or for business."}
{"text":"Good food but you are definitely paying for the quality and experience. Arrive with an open mind, and maybe some pre dinner snacks and cocktails.

Date and I shared 2 large dishes and a small dish, coffee and two ice creams for about $70. Starting to get out of my price range but at least the food was great quality and very creatively thought out.

Ordered crispy squid, manti dumplings, and the lamb. Definitely try to lamb!!!"}
{"text":"Went with a few girls from work to try out their punch bowl, unfortunately did not realize they only serve it a few nights of the week.. Regardless the waitress, mixologist and bartenders were very accommodating and brewed us up a bowl!  I am grateful to them since it was very delicious, like no other drink I've ever had! blueberry infused vodka, cinnamon, rose pedals, I wish i could remember the rest.

We also grabbed the Crispy Squid, Turkish Manti Dumplings and labneh which were all great."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 815pm for party of 10. I arrive at 750pm holding a second cup coffee and was greeted cooly by the blue eye shadow wearing hostess with braces who promptly informs me that they do not allow drinks from outside. 

Our reservations were upstairs and they had to escort us up to the bar. Instead of going up to join a friend who had also arrived early, I was outside on the sidewalk trying to gulp down my coffee as fast as I could. Perfect start to my evening. 

Luckily there was a valet outside who was nice to talk to. Very friendly and not snobby as you might expect from such a trendy establishment. 

So finally I get inside after a lengthy wait at the hostess desk. My coat gets checked at no fee. Considering we were getting a family style set menu at $75 plus tax and tip, that's the least one could expect. 

The ambiance is definitely very hip, trendy, almost retro. The music is low key jazzy and funky. The decor is original interesting, tasteful. 5 stars for atmosphere.

We were all seated and offered water and drinks right away. We were seated at a corner table comfortably for a party of 10.

Our food started coming out on a timely basis. First came the olives and bread with a white dipping sauce on the side. It was some kind of flatbread doused with a generous amount of spices. Good but nothing mind blowing. This was followed by lamb ribs - good but also nothing too special. They were braised and had some toppings on top. We each had one small rib. Then came the fried cheese on top of a slice of watermelon. Original and different but not spectacular. 

Our main course finally arrived- rib eye with pan fried broccoli served with rice and green beans. The steak was was - medium rare, tasty. They served three large steaks for 9 people so we each had three thin slices (approx 4-5oz). The green beans were good topped with chopped roasted pepper but nothing memorable. The rice was good - basmati with lentils and lots of middle eastern spices. Dessert was a mousse cake topped with whipped cream, crunchy caramel flakes and a few pomegranate seeds. Each person had half of a tiny one person serving.

Good overall meal. Great service. Food portions were too small for $100 including 18% auto gratuity given that it was served family style. Not the best value for your bucks but that's the price you pay for   a fine dining experience at a new hip/trendy resto. 

Would definitely go back to try the regular menu however would recommend eating first before getting the set meals if you happen to be very hungry."}
{"text":"4.5/5! I highly recommend this place for people who like middle eastern food. Great environment and delicious starters. Best of all, it is close to the financial district (which is a treasure since most restaurants in that area are not that good).  The Labneh and associated dishes are great, the grilled cod is a must try, and the eggplant dishes just melt in your mouth. We also got a rice dish to share which was good but overly filling. All in all, you cannot go wrong with any of your choices."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, and superb service."}
{"text":"Our first time and our waiter ordered for us and we didn't get a bad dish.  We ended with the slow roasted lamb leg that was fantastic.  Truthfully everything was outstanding including the service.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent experience at Byblos. We were a group of 4 and shared the labneh, ceviche, mussels, dumplings, brussel sprouts, sweet jeweled rice, and lamb, and were all full by the end. We also shared the donuts for dessert. The standouts were the labneh and lamb, and I'm normally not a lamb person. Great vibe and service. I'd be happy to go back!"}
{"text":"Just amazing!  I totally recommend this place.  On point!"}
{"text":"Byblos is the latest restaurant venture by Charles Khabouth, following successes with Patria and Weslodge.

While tapas is a ubiquitous trend in Toronto, Byblos is a unique Mediterranean spin on the trend.

I had the roasted red beets, citrus olives, duck kibbeh and the cheese acharuli. The beets were great especially from someone who isn't normally a beet fan, the duck kibbeh was very flavourful and the quail egg added a great touch to the cheese acharuli. Also strongly recommend the home made ice creams. 

Presentation was fantastic and service was very attentive. Will be returning again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We went to Byblos during tiff. Our waiter was great but the hostess needed to calm down a bit! We ordered a few dishes ( the couscous with brown butter, beets with yogurt, the smoked eggplant dumpling and the ceviche) all the dishes were ok the eggplant dumplings were delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for a cumulative celebration night for me and my gf, back in October '15. New job, anniversary, her new job, just a whole bunch of stuff. They really made it special, down to the little message they put on the dessert and remembered everything I noted in the reservation comment box. Interesting place inside with medi accents. Food was phenomenal. Looking forward to next time with friends.

ps get the dumplings, esp if you like anything dumpling related"}
{"text":"It is one of the best restaurants in Toronto. I have been there several times and tried most of the menu items. Definitely try the crispy eggplant for appetizer as well as the beef tartar. For the main course the lamb and fish are delicious and so tasty. we also tried the lentil rice and the crispy couscous and loved them. The restaurant itself is very cozy and welcoming. I love the furniture and the staff are very nice."}
{"text":"The food here will make you forget about the world!

Delicious cocktails and unbelievable food! We had the lamb ribs, the dumplings and the fig salad. Everything was incredible, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is exquisite. My buddy and I ordered the Crispy squid, fries, fried chicken and truffle wood fired bread, all were incredible. We also ordered the only beer on tap and even that did not disappoint, it was a coffee infused porter by collective arts and delicious. Going back next week."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that this place is fusion but done on a hyper level (it's a fusion of the Mediterranean) I've read up about Byblos before setting foot as researching what I'm about to devour is important to me; and I wasn't disappointed. 

A group of 5 of us sat down for a late dinner and opted for the servers to surprise us with the dishes they most loved which I think is a great way to go when you're dining for experience with good friends.

The first course was a selection of salads, olives, and nuts. A big stand out for me was the roasted, pickled beet salad on top of some house made labneh. BAD.ASS. 

Second course included a series of sharable plates highlighted by incredible dukkah dusted lamb ribs and seared duck fat dripped cauliflower. This shit was on point; also an insane fried eggplant with basturma sliced on top.

Oh ya by this time I was a few cocktails in. They made me forget the pain.

Third course was dominated by oxtail basmati rice, a whole boneless branzino (I usually hate fish but this was dope) some wonderfully downright delightful manti dumplings, and the dry aged ribeye that I wanted to get married to.

We were fat but still hungry so we ended the savory with crispy calamari and steak tartar. Mmmmmm

Dessert was..well everything. I think we had it all. The stand out was the yoghurt mousse but the trippiest thing was a pyramid dessert from the future that tasted like a floral bouquet. 

If my spelling and grammar suck that's awesome.

The end."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great atmosphere for couples and small groups.  Food was generous and well priced.  I see they are reviewed as \"great for groups\", please be reassured these are seated upstairs, so it's nice and quiet and romantic downstairs.  Highlights included the martinis (well done), the oxtial rice (very tasty and heavy on the meat), the squid pomegranate salad and the brussel sprouts!
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant and highly recommended. We covered quite a lot of dishes between our collective - the octopus, acharuli, crispy eggplant and everything was highly enjoyable. This is definitely Middle Eastern / Mediterranean fusion and not a typical menu. We then enjoyed a lot of fresh fish as they were out of the lamb, and our mains overall were great. The grilled fish of the day was a standout, as were the dumplings and rice. Only issue was it took awhile to get out initial drinks ordered but it was smooth sailing after that."}
{"text":"We had a very large group and had the fixed menu. The evening started off with some tasty olives and a delicious bread with za'ater and labneh. The bread was scrumptious. Nice and crispy on the outside and so fluffy and hot on the inside. 
My fired eggplant was a bit too salty. Also, the fig salad was lacking figs. The watermelon, cheese and mint salad however was lovely. 
The jeweled rice was delicious, so sweet and flavorful. The thrice-cooked chips (aka fries) were good too. 
Finally, for dessert, we had the qatayef. It was delicious, so close to what my mom makes. 
The amiance and decor are beautiful. The service is exceptional. All the portions are good too. We had nore than enough food
It's a bit of a pricey restaurant, but well worth it"}
{"text":"loved the ambiance 
food is ok need to try more items to be sure
enjoyed it!!"}
{"text":"I got to go Byblos last night! Been trying for weeks and I had an great time; however, my experience with the hostess left a bad taste in service (reason I did not provide a 5 star)...so my focus on this review will be on my experience with this unfriendly hostess.

My friend got there before me, and was taken up to the bar on second floor. When I got there the hostess told me everything was fully booked including the bar, shortly after I received a text from my friend saying she was already upstairs. So I told the hostess someone was already waiting for me upstairs and she got really uncomfortable and upset. 
While I was enjoying the delicious food and excellent drinks made by Clayton I couldn't help but to notice the empty bar stools. I couldn't understand why the hostess was so rude in denying there was available spots at the bar. 

Every dish we ordered last night was absolutely delicious, full of goodness, well prepared, rush in flavours and aroma!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times since it opened and I'm so happy we have a place like this in Toronto now.  I suggested it to my sister-in-law for her birthday (and she is from NYC), and she was amazed and loved it too.  Can't go wrong with any of the dishes, the service is great, sommelier always willing to explain wines, and cocktails are also really delicious.  Go treat yourself for a special occasion you will not be disappointed!  I think the lamb ribs are my favorite but honestly everything is so good it doesn't matter what you order!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Great food and service. Drink menu was excellent.

I would definitely come back for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"Wow! Really loved this place. I brought a group of ten women here and the restaurant was extremely helpful in planning our meal beforehand. We ordered a $75 prix fixe (and a few extras) which at first seemed slightly steep but we were all FULL by the end (small plates are deceiving!!). Everything we had was flavorful and unique - it was interesting that nothing tastes like each other (if that makes sense).
Service was attentive and great, drinks were fantastic (even us pregnant women who had to have virgin cocktails), and loved the ambiance and decor.

If you get only one thing: get the calamari!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The Cornish hen was awesome! Good service. food, and right near downtown.  Gotta check it out when it Toronto."}
{"text":"Inventive from decor to food to drink, plus great service. We enjoyed the beet salad with labneh & pistachios, the well-spiced shakshouka (I detected and confirmed a slight cardamom note) and Majadra basmati rice with lentils and crispy shallots, along with a Lebanese red wine. The yogurt mousse with playful Turkish cotton candy and pistachio cake is light and  different. It was our favorite meal during the week we spent in Toronto. Tickle your tastebuds and go to enjoy the curvy loveseats, well-placed lighting, and circular glass adornments (long rectangles deserve curves!) and be treated well by the service staff."}
{"text":"Arrived early ahead of a hockey game, so the atmosphere was not what it could have been until around the time we were leaving, but no fault of the venue.  The look is great though - we sat in the upstairs \"lounge\" area, which although cozy, the combination of low-backed, curved banquettes with small round tables make things a bit uncomfortable as knees knock and you look for a way to lean. Tried a good variety, with the yogurt baked fluke being the standout.  Labneh (the thickest, most delicious yogurt) accompanied a few different dishes and my wife and I could not get enough.  Rich flavouring with sour, sweet and savoury appearing throughout - molasses based sauces drizzled over kibbeh, manti dumplings and lamb ribs (good, but understandably sparse) was a nice touch.  Could have tried any of the desserts, but settled on the yogurt mousse and the loukoumades (as good or better than any you can find on the Danforth)."}
{"text":"Pretty fancy place - not very kid friendly at all. We ordered the mantu dumplings which were pretty tasty. Really enjoyed the lebneh and the bread it came with was fantastic. Warm, toasted with lots of sesame on top. We also ordered the Persian rice which were full of aroma and good amount of nuts. The presentation was very nice and so was the flavor"}
{"text":"My wife and I took our friend here last night and we all loved it. Our friend is no stranger to dining at amazing restaurants. He has been to dozens of Michelin rated restaurants all over the world and he thought Byblos was fantastic. The service was spot on, the drinks were delicious and the food was great. We shared 8 dishes. Organic House Labneh, Truffle pide, Lamb rack, black cod, fried chicken, octopus, eggplant kibbeh, french fries. We also shared 3 desserts. Pizzelle,Loukoumades, Crispy Qatayef. My top three were the labneh, fried chicken and the Lamb, but I would order that menu again. After dinner we had drinks at the bar at Alo and that is another story. Don't hesitate to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for my friend's birthday last night, since both of us had been meaning to try it for months now. While the food was good, the service we received from our waitress was pretty terrible.

Before the meal, she came by to fill my water cup and spilled some water in the process. She acknowledged it, but NEVER tried to clean up the spill! I had to dab away the puddle with my own napkin. I've been to cheap pubs in my university years where they would immediately clean a spill and apologize profusely, so this was alarming. Strike 1.

Strike 2 was how slow it was to have out orders taken, and how she basically rolled her eyes at our order and when we didn't take her suggestions. My friend and I know how much we can eat, and the kinds  of things we like. We never asked for suggestions, so she didn't have to supply them if she didn't want to. There was just so much attitude that it was off-putting. 

Finally, we requested our bills with our dessert as we needed to make a show and told her this. It took 15 mins for us to receive our bills and pay (after we received our dessert) and we saw other customers cashing out before us. Strike 3 was it - my friend and I each tipped only 15% (which is 10% less than what we normally give) and even that seemed to high for the service. The only redeeming quality was that the food was decent and the kitchen staff did well, albeit my friend and I have both had better and more authentic Mediterranean fare (we are both Mediterranean too!) at cheaper mom-and-pop places.

The Good - the Gulab drink (amazing rose flavour and beautiful presentation); one order of lamb ribs (my friend found hers to be too fatty); duck & eggplant kibbehs; both the pistachio and Turkish coffee chocolate ice creams (incredible flavours, especially together!).

The Bad - the sours drink (too creamy and thick from the egg whites for our palates); 
the mussels (way too salty and overspiced); the qatayef (non-traditional filling was disappointing to my friend, and they really just tasted like a standard funnel cake). 

The Ugly - the \"service\". 

Too many other great restaurants to try, so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last Saturday night with another couple.  The ambiance (we sat upstairs) was really great-loved the long prep table!  Service great-we loved hearing what each dish was comprised of.  The food was very good-different and fresh.  We ordereded a lot of food!  My husband and friend's husband LOVED the lamb.  Said it was fall off the bone best lamb they have ever eaten.  We all really enjoyed the fish.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we ordered the beet salad.  The server told us she would ask them to give us 4 beets instead of 3.  When the dish arrived I was very surprised that for $12 they give you maybe a quarter of a medium size beet.  Not very good value in my opinion.  It was very tasty and I wanted more.  Then, the kicker, when the bill arrived they charged us $1 for the extra piece of beet.  We were floored and all thought this was disgraceful!  Really???  The bill came to $270 with tax and tip and you felt it necessary to charge us $1.00 for an extra piece of beet!  What a way to ruin a lovely meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening with a party of 4. The place was decently packed around 1900 and was full by 2100. The place has a nice decor and is quite comfortable. 

Had the Salmon Tartare, Achrauli and Crispy Eggplant for appetizers. The salmon and Achrauli were really nice and the spices really enhanced the flavour. The eggplant was deep fried and had mashed eggplant in it. It was ok, nothing special. 

For main course we had the red snapper fish and mejadra rice. Both were delicious. The red snapper was tender and tasteful. One could really taste the spices in the rice and was almost like a light hearted biryani. 

The crispy qatayeh was a delicious dessert."}
{"text":"Not your standard Mediterranean fare.  In fact, I would recommend this for the pickiest eaters who are sure they hate Mediterranean food.  Not to be missed are the brussel sprouts.  I fancy myself a bit of a brussel sprouts connoisseur and these are the best.  Again, if you hate brussel sprouts you should try these anyway, you'll love them.  We had the cornish hen - delicious, would take a bath in the sauce it was served with if I didn't think they'd kick me out.  The guys at my table ordered the lamb ribs, slow cooked for 16 hours, fall off the bone tender, and a crazy generous portion.  For a table of 4 we ordered 1 appetizer (fried eggplant, passable but could have skipped it), 2 veggie sides (crispy hand rolled couscous with creamed collard greens - yum, did I mention the brussel sprouts?), and the two meat entrees already mentioned.  This was plenty of food with lamb to take home for leftovers. I travel to Toronto regulary for business and Byblos is a must-eat destination."}
{"text":"Food was interesting but just ok. The crispy squid was our favourite dish that night. Not a fan of their Mejadra rice. The dumplings were very saucy but apart from that sauce, the dumplings themselves were actually dry and bland. 

Service was unacceptably slow! Waited for 20 minutes for our second dish after we finished the first one. It took an hour for all dishes to finally come to table. Another 15-20 minutes for the lady to bring the card machine. 

Won't come back."}
{"text":"I came here a month ago with a group of friends for dinner. We ordered the lamb ribs, tuna ceviche, Turkish manti dumplings,Spanish octopus, Persian style fried rice, and the roasted brussel sprouts. The food was all delicious. My personal favourite was the Turkish manti dumplings. The yogurt sauce was creamy but not heavy. I typically don't like lamb but really enjoyed the lamb ribs. The meat was tender and flavourful. We also had a wonderful server, Joel, who was very accommodating and added an extra lamb rib so that we would have enough for each person in the group. This is definitely one of the better restaurants that I've been to in Toronto in terms of consistency with the quality of their food.

The only negative thing I have to say is that it is a bit pricey for the amount of food that you get, but I guess you're also paying for the quality of food as well. The dishes are tapa-styled so if you are starving and not willing to spend much money, I wouldn't come here. It's a nice place to have a conversation with good food and drinks on the side though. The restaurant isn't too loud and has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"My go to for quite some time. The ultimate place for Mediterranean food. The food is delicious and the decor is classy. My favorite is always the Turkish dumplings. My experiences with servers however have varied. Sometimes I get a server that I wish I could just send home myself and sometimes I get a server thats very attentive and charming."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6, and had a fantastic dining experience.  Restaurant is over a couple of floors, and we were seated upstairs.  The space is vibrant and noisy, and well laid out with lots of semi-circle booths.    

Our server seemed to be covering a very large area, and so we sometimes waited a little, but the dude was hustling and trying his best.  Despite being uber-busy, he was friendly, gracious, didn't rush us, shared recommendations on food/wine/cocktails, etc.

We opted for the prix fixe menu.  The server mentioned they might have sold out of some items, but if we were OK with substitutions then they would just bring us a whole bunch of dishes...nothing could have sounded better!  We must have tried a dozen different items in total, and everything was spectacular. Everything was flavourful with and well-presented, with some interesting juxtaposition of tastes.  And, they had a malbec on the wine list that I really like and I don't think I've ever seen in Ontario (Burrowing Owl from BC). 

And, best of all, the prices were quite reasonable.  Our bill for 6 people was about $800 before tip, and that included a couple of bottle of wine and a few of rounds of cocktails. 

A great dining experience from start to finish.  Lots of times the hot new restaurants are all hype and little substance, but this place deserves all the attention it gets (which unfortunately means you need to reserve a table faaaaaaar in advance)."}
{"text":"Ordered the Turkish manti dumplings, beet salad, mussels, shaksouka and the lamb ribs, for two people good amount of food . Thoroughly enjoyed the beet salad, dumplings and lamb ribs. Mussels were way too spicy and shaksouka just OK. Did not appreciated $5 extra charge for extra few pieces of bread. Bread is complementary in many restaurants, especially Eastern themed ones. Servers bringing the dishes to tables and presenting are quite nice but I did not get the same vibe from the other staff (in my two visits)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in TO! Every single dish will make your taste buds so happy."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST restaurant in Toronto! Each dish is delicious and full of flavour. The menu items are fun and different from other restaurants. The service is prompt and polite. The atmosphere is on the fancier end and really feels like something special. It is on the pricier end, but if you have the money to spend, it's definitely worth it. All in all, an amazing spot to go to for any kind of special occasion or date night. Reserve in advance since it will be packed!"}
{"text":"Simply brilliant food. One of the most outstanding gastronomic experiences I have ever had in Toronto. We actually applauded every single dish.  We just had to call the chef to congratulate him and thank him for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I've been here only once and the food while was great, I felt like the long wait put a damper on the experience. Went there for dinner with some friends and the food took a while to come out. The hostess was friendly but the service was a bit slow in general. Food itself was great, small tapas style food. Perhaps I'll come back to try it again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food was not as expected and definitely not worth the price. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the fig salad. Would never go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The issue I have here is consistency. The same dishes can vary in how tasty and cooked they are from time to time. For ex., the brussel sprout dish was my favourite dish on one occasion, and then on another occasion was very undercooked and they had skimped on the haloumi cheese. There were a few other dishes on this occasion that were not up to par as they had previously been. I'm honestly not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went there in December for my fiance's Christmas work holiday party. I was skeptical of the food but when the food started coming to the table I was intrigued. Everything was presented well and tasted good. One comment is that they served a lot of olives and they were a bit much. Wish that the olives were served with something else to balance out the flavours.
They had really interesting alcoholic beverages that tasted pretty good!"}
{"text":"Dined with 5 colleagues. Food was excellent. Drinks were excellent Service was excellent, from our waitress, and the entire waitstaff."}
{"text":"The black truffle pide (and everything else) is truly life changing. Planning my next trip to Toronto around multiple returns to Byblos."}
{"text":"One word - Desserts.
Two more words - Turkish coffee.

I had their salad and my friend had their fried chicken and some appetizer. The food we ordered tasted great. I loved the Turkish coffee especially. It was smooth, strong but no bitter aftertaste. 

Great ambience but busy because it is popular. A little loud and cramped for my taste.  The fixtures and wall decorations are quite interesting. The staff are courteous."}
{"text":"I'm not your typical fan of Mediterranean cuisine, but eating at Byblos has opened my eyes to a whole different style of food. Go in and ask the staff to bring to the table what they think is best - you will be blown away by complementing flavors and textures utilized by some innovative cooking techniques. 
Do yourself a favor, take 3 hours on a Friday night and enjoy a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We asked the waiter to recommend dishes to us since it was our first time here. The food did not disappoint. Flavorful, delightful and just plain delicious. Naturally we couldn't get enough so we overindulged but well worth it. We ended the evening with chocolate mousse and ice cream. Even their dessert was elegant, delicious and down right good! Needless to say, this restaurant exceeded my expectations and we will definitely be back. Tip-you need to reserve weeks in advance because seating is limited and Byblos has established themselves as a top contender in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"My sister and I went for dinner and it was fantastic-.

The gulab vodkas were amazing and I had three! I'm Indian so I'm assuming they're supposed to take after gulab jamun which is an Indian dessert. They are really amazing...so please try!

Service was fantastic. The waiters went above and beyond for my sister and I. I have been to both Patria and Weslodge and I would say that Byblos is superior but that is subjective because naturally I am more into the Mediterranean cuisine as of late. (I've been noticing the trend is becoming popular in Toronto and nyc).

Food was amazing! Lebeneh, duck kibbeh, seared cauliflower, halibut' katayef and the ice cream is what we shared.

Great food and I felt so fat after hehe! Have fun!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Very attentive and knowledgeable staff.
Presentation of food was very well done.
Very disappointed with how everything tasted. Maybe my expectations were too high but nothing was amazing.  Everything was good or average.  Feel like I can get similar tasting food at a mid level middle eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"I do not have a habit of writing about my dining experiences nor the food offered at restaurants. The reason I am about to write THIS review is because I am disliking a trend I am observing, the trend of cultural appropriation in the culinary scene in Toronto. I agree novelty, creativity, and innovation in food and dining experience are becoming the staple of the industry and the standard by which we assess or evaluate a restaurant. Chefs are becoming 'artists' and restaurants are turning into 'fields of experiences.'  Granted. Check. Yup. I like that.  

Yet, here's the \"but:\" 
The novelty or creativity should not come with the cost of misappropriation of a culinary culture, loss of taste in food, nor with the price of condescending the patrons of the restaurant. In my experience (last night) this place did exactly all of that lat night.   

Let me start with the menu. The restaurant takes the patrons as under-educated or as ignorant consumers. For that, it liberally uses random (and dare I say again, random) mix of Arabic, Turkish, and Persian words, only to exotify the menu.  The menu is a tasteless verbal mix of an 'exotic' otherness! 

The food itself. The lamb, chicken, and calamari tasted alike (almost identical). Easy: just burry them in the exact same blend of spices (that are used in pinched moderation in Mediterranean or MiddleEastern culinary scenes). Then voila, you have identical taste profiles. Let me put it another way: the meat, vegetables, or even the rice, were carrying devices for EXCESSIVE salt and spices.   And yes, the Barbary Bread (the most common bread in the Persian world) was dried up, over toasted, covered with a mountain of salt, and priced as high as a tall mountain. 

The service (rather, the server) -- thank you very much, I can read. But if you allow me some light and grant me a minute to go over your jungle of words that you call a Menu!  

To sum it up: if you want Mediterranean or Middle-eastern food, then get out of downtown busyness and drive up to a local authentic restaurant. There are many of them in Toronto.   If you want to feel posh, to feel exotified, to join in appropriating other cultures, to feel you've become 'cultured' by having Barbary (read: bread), then by all means do support this restaurant and do become a fan. But for your own sake, don't fool others about the menu, the food, or the service!"}
{"text":"Byblos. Thank you. Wow. We were recently there on February 14th 2016 to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and wow- you are the best restaurant in downtown toronto- a real bang for your buck and QUALITY food, using the best ingredients. I unfortunately have many food challenges and not only did your staff and chef accommodate this, when they realized they had made a mistake with the fish prep, they told me another one was already being made! And then the fish came out and my tummy was literally rejoicing! It melted in my mouth and with the limited ingredients I could have, the flavours came through as if it had been marinating for 2 days. And my boyfriend had the sampler for himself and was the happiest birthday valentine boy on earth! 


...this is coming from someone who doesn't like downloading apps but did so just to write this review! Mmmm Byblos. See you soon, friend!"}
{"text":"Heard great reviews about place both on yelp and through friends. We ordered:

crispy eggplant 5*: this dish did not disappoint. The best.

lamb ribs 4*: very tasty, tender, would order again

cornish hen 3*: large dish for sharing. flavourful.

cauliflower 5*: can't go wrong with cauliflower, esp when duck fat is involved

Overall, delicious food in a nicely decorated restaurant. Service was alright. Would come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"One of the best food experience I've had! I definitely recommend going with a large crowd as the dishes are meant to be shared, something that I did not know when I made a reservation. For the starters we had the Duck Kibbeh, Shakshouka, and the Organic House Labneh. The kibbeh's were out of this world savoury! As a main we had Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, Yogurt Baked Fluke, Lamb Rack, and the Sweet Jeweled Rice. To finish off the meal we had Pavlova and the Loukoumades. I also ordered the The Rose Gulab cocktail; it was one of the best cocktails I have ever had! The Shakshouka is also one of the best dishes I have ever eaten at a restaurant ever; it was absolutely mind-blowing. The staff were extremely friendly and the atmosphere was wonderful. It's a pricey restaurant, for sure, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I loved it here, the ambiance, the drinks were great and the food was delicious. My favorite item was the fig salad, it hits every taste bud in your mouth! DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Byblos is the best in the city - from the ambience, the wait staff, and most importantly, the food - everything here WOWs me, each time I come. Try the manti dumplings to start - I have dreams about them :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding design and outstanding food. Subterranean but killer execution and vibe. Always look forward to returning here."}
{"text":"Byblos stands only a few feet from restaurants on King Street West but its cuisine stands miles apart. It's outstanding. From the wonderfully designed, modern-eclectic interior to the well-versed wait staff to the exceptional and unique fair, Byblos is a must-try. The cuisine is a modern take on classic Mediterranean flavors, creating one-of-a-kind dishes. Each plate is meant to be shared, making the experience all the more inclusive and enjoyable (not to mention allows you to sample as many of these fantastic dishes as possible). The favorites of our party were the Turkish Manti Dumplings, the Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous, and the Fig Salad. Exquisite flavors. Exquisite cuisine. Will most definitely visit again (and again and again)."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and have only tried a few dishes, but everything is superb.  The rice dishes in particular are worlds better than anything I've had at any other Mediterranean restaurant.  Excellent cocktails too."}
{"text":"We were super excited to finally eat at Byblos on the weekend. It was our first time and we had high expectations. The service was excellent and our server explained how everything worked, wiped our table multiple times between courses, refilled our water in a timely manner and checked up on us. Unfortunately the food was a disappointment. You can tell they use good quality ingredients, but the flavour was just not there. I've been to many tasty middle eastern restaurants and Byblos seems to be somewhat bland, lacking garlic, more flavourful spices and even salt. We expected the portions to be small and they were, but for the average taste, I think it's too expensive. Many dishes tasted yogurty. Also, one of the prep chefs was wearing a hat with Nike printed on it - get a Byblos hat. They were also on their cellphones when they had nothing to do. Thought that was a bit unprofessional.
We ordered:

Bottle Water - $8. There was something in my glass so our next bottle was on the house!

Turkish Manti Dumplings - not great, tasted like phyllo pastry stuffed with smokey sour cream, did not taste the eggplant at all, needed some salt

Labneh with house bread - tastes like plain yogurt with no seasoning and bread was hard

Black Truffle Pide - about 1.5\" wide, didn't taste any truffle, just cheese, I could easily make this at home

Chargrilled Cornish Hen - portion was bigger, 2 legs, 2 breasts, mildly flavoured, nothing great 

Striploin - portion was bigger, 12 ozs, tastes like a regular steak on yogurt, good thing they threw some hot sauce on the yogurt

Sweet Jeweled rice - very lightly flavoured and a bit dry, I only tasted the sweetness of the carrots

Orange Blossom Mousse - this was the best dish of the night. Very tasty, but small, not worth the price

Marrakesh Mint and Earl Grey - not loose tea but tea bags. I asked our server if they had rock sugar and she said yes, but brought over sugar cubes! Lol

All in all, I am glad we went to Byblos. It satisfied my curiosity and I would recommed it to anyone who hasn't been before, but I won't be coming back again. I'd rather save my money and go to an authentic middle eastern restaurant where I would get lots of tasty food."}
{"text":"I've been heard people talking about Byblos for a while and finally got a chance to visit. We ordered 4 starters, 1 side, 2 mains and 1 rice which is good for four people. My personally favorite was the US Striploin. We request medium and the meet was tender and flavorful with bone marrows on the top. The truffle pizza and the lamb ribs were delicious too. I think it would be better if the pizza could be more cheesy. The salad was ok. The rice was not what I expected but it tasted very unique. Overall I think I had a good experience dining here. Although the taste of the food was not what I am familiar and what I get used to, it's still good to try restaurant like this and to explore different kinds of food from every corner of the world."}
{"text":"Thought the ambiance would be different... it looked like an abandoned french salon or something. Anyways, were excited to get reservations to this syper hyped place.

Our waiter was horribly rude -- clearly having a bad day or something. He rolled his eyes at us when we had several questions about the menu... never OK in my opinion. He also was very rude and corrected my friends when they asked for the nuts in a seperate bowl for a dish, because one of the girls in the group has a severe nut allergy. He rolled his eyes and said yeah,\"on the side,\" and we were like no, to be clear, not on the side of the dish, in a seperate dish because she's highly allergic. 

The dumplings -- given such good reviews on yelp were horrendous. They came with a warm yogurty sauce and the filling was smokey... very odd combo and super heavy. we couldn't keep the dumplings down.

The only thing that was decent was the tomato salad and the french fries. 

But based on the service alone, we felt very unwelcome. This place -- and the people who work at it -- clearly have let the hype get to their head. Save your money."}
{"text":"Having read the reviews, I had my wallet ready. The food was about as good as I expected, given the prices on their menus. For most dishes, there were competing flavours. While it was definitely a great experience, the portion sizes are right up there with barely anything at all. Paying top dollar for this was well worth it but coming back will be another matter."}
{"text":"I booked my birthday dinner at Byblos for 13 guests after hearing many great reviews about the restaurant. It was an absolute fantastic evening. The food, wine, cocktails, service and atmosphere was amazing! We went on the $65 set menu for the table. It was delicious! TONS of food. Andrew was our waiter. He was great! He kept the table clean, constantly watering our glasses and filling up our wines. The restaurant staff were very accommodating to one guests dietary restrictions. We were all vey happy and will definitely be back! Thanks Byblos!"}
{"text":"A random girls night out turned amazing by this charming space and great food. When we first called to book a last minute reservation, they told us they were fully booked, but when we showed up at 7pm the place was almost empty and stayed that way for at least another hour.  But I guess the great service throughout dinner made up for that. 
Anyways, we got a bunch of dishes to share. They were all really good but my favourites were the turkish dumpling and the grilled cauliflower. My friend got this smoked caramel ice cream and it was amazing! I've never tasted anything like it before. 
Overall a great new addition to Toronto's food scene. An amazing place to just have a chilled time hanging with friends."}
{"text":"YEAH. It's really good. The service, the unique slant on Mediterranean dishes you won't find elsewhere in the city, and the flavours are all A+. It generally feels like healthy food, as well. A nice wine list and lots of options for veg/gluten free diners. Treat yourself to Byblos TO if you don't happen to be in South Beach (the other location)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is considered Eastern Mediterranean. The food is ordered in a tapas style menu and has plenty of vegetarian options. We had the crispy eggplant, roasted beets, roasted brussel sprouts, Turkish dumplings, baked green olives and lamb ribs. All were excellently seasoned with wonderful aromatic spices. When I return, I would likely not re-order the olives. They were good, but just olives. The restaurant is very unassuming from the outside and easy to pass. This is a definitely a winner."}
{"text":"My first time at Byblos was in 2014 with my husband, before our Book of Mormon show, and it was so incredible that I always hoped for a reason to come back. Behold Winter 2016, it finally happened! A dear friend of mine was in town and we had dinner at Byblos. 

Our order:
Crispy eggplant - perfectly crispy, not at all oily. eggplant had a great texture. accompanying sauce paired well. 
Tuna ceviche - fresh, coriander/mint flavours, which I always love
Turkish manti - sweet, smoky, creamy 
Roasted brussel sprouts with halloumi - the best vegetable to roast made even better with halloumi! 

For dessert we shared chocolate mousse. The touch of acid with the pomegranate was perfect with the rich textures and flavours. 

All in all, Byblos is a special dining experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Dinner at Byblos last night was a wonderful intro to Toronto. Upstairs room was great, with comfortable seating. Cocktails were perfect. Food was terrific: crispy baby artichokes with labneh, eggplant kibbeh, spinach bread, hand-rolled cous cous, fattouche, branzino, and lamb. Ice creams are unusual and well done. All plates are family style. Problem was that, for a party of four, servings were small. We thought the restaurant should have offered to increase portions; for example, lamb came with three ribs, but there were four of us. We would have paid for an extra rib. Rice servings are much larger than cous cous; had the waiter told us more, we would have ordered differently. And the waiter, knowing my husband is allergic to tree nuts, didn't tell us which plates had nuts. We were told only as the plates were set on the table. Complaints aside, the meal was wonderful."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. 
Great service, decors, food, prefect for date. 
My husband and I tried Turkish manti dumplings, Crispy Confit Duck, Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, Sujuk pide that were new flavours to me but I enjoyed them all.
BUT my highlight of the place was dessert, -Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse with Turkish coffee!
That was one of my best dessert I have ever tried. 

Highly recommended to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday celebration and got major brownie points =).
This place is super classy and its perfect for a date.

Byblos has made me fall in love with Eastern Mediterranean food. 
The menu got me super excited as I  saw many dishes on it that I have never even heard of before.The ones that stood out the most were the Duck Kibbeh and the yogurt baked fluke.

The dish we could have done without was the Spanish octopus.This is a dish I always order at any restaurant and almost never disappoints but was unfortunately underwhelming this time around. 
I would love to come back to try the dumplings which seem to be very popular."}
{"text":"This two level restaurant was busy when I walked in around 7 PM, but as a single diner I was able to have a seat at their upstairs bar fairly quickly. It was fairly noisy and dim, but the staff was attentive and the smells of food were amazing. The portions had a range of sizes, and everything I tried had a fantastic flavor blend and texture profile. I was able to start the evening with an off-menu mezcal cocktail by Jullian, that had citrus aromatics and a full, wonderfully smoky flavor. The character changed as the drink warmed too--masterful recipe! The lamb ribs were smaller than I anticipated, but delicious enough I will order two plates on my next visit. Crispy, saucy, sweet and savory all at once. Oh, and the sauces at this place, as I heard from nearby diners and experienced myself, will make you want to lick your plate/bowl!

I had the smoky eggplant dumplings and the basmati lentil rice to round things out. The rice platter was well big enough for more people, and I took the leftovers with me."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and beautiful ambiance. 
Nice to have a splurge once in a while and if looking for a nice night out with a bit of an upscale feel and very tasty food I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very fancy medditerean food. Do not go with bunch of hungry young boys as it will get very pricy. 

Highly recommended to come with reservation, although we did get lucky to get a seat at a table. 

Service is excellet and food is well cooked."}
{"text":"YUM. Everything here is amazing. Bring a few friends and split each dish. Make sure to ask the server how many dishes to order based on the amount of people at the table. I LOVE this place and I feel like a wealthy lady whenever I come. Going to try to get my parents to take me for my birthday in a few weeks"}
{"text":"Generally I am a fan of restaurants where I can share food; bit more of an interesting experience.  This restaurant had many choices and we ordered a lot; too much actually.  For the most part all of our selections were really delicious and I would not complain.  My favourite was the beets....WOW were they ever good.  My least favourite was the cod; but it might be because I don't like grape leaves.  The brussel sprouts were delicious and I generally don't eat brussel sprouts.  All in all a very nice experience.  What I will say is their wine is severely overpriced; as an example, one wine I normally order at another restaurant for $95.00 was $190 at Byblos.....this was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Every dish was packed full with flavour using the freshest ingredients. Highly recommended, and vegetarian-friendly food as well."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life. The food, service and overall experience were beyond comparable to any restaurant I've ever been to. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant during our trip to Toronto. We had bread with yogurt and beets, lamb ribs, dumplings and much more - everything we ate was amazing. Seems like the type of place where you can do no wrong when ordering your food. Service was prompt and friendly, atmosphere beautiful and moody (thanks to the dim lighting) without peetentious vibes."}
{"text":"Great food. loved the pide and octopus dishes. The portions are a little small but the ambiance is really nice."}
{"text":"Lovely spot for dinner or a fancy lunch. 

Memorable dishes were the Crispy Baby Artichoke dish with housemade labneh, preserved lemon and olive oil The truffle rice was so luxurious with foraged mushrooms and crème fraîche pockets that bursted in your mouth. Turkish Manti Dumplings with smokey eggplant and yogurt sauce had the perfect smoky:creamy ratio. 

The way the interior designers embraced the lofty space which still keeping it super modern, yet opulent, is very impressive. Service was on point. Attentive, but never intrusive. The wine list + cellar is plentiful. What more could you desire?"}
{"text":"It was like going back to Morocco.
The food was beyond fantastic. 
Place was packed on Tuesday night, but I was lucky to reserve in advance.
Roasted beets with home labne are simply orgasmic.
Cod on skewers wrapped in wine leaves is absolutely incredible. So is a hand-rolled couscous.
Service is impeccable, atmosphere is cosy and the food is just AMAZING!
Coming back. Soon. With all of my friends.

I think I just found my new favorite spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here but this is definitely a great restaurant. By far the best drink I've ever had is their alcoholic drink with rosewater.  Served on ice in a metal goblet, it is to die for. 
So many options that I would guess are extremely healthy. This is truly fancy middle eastern food. Try the \"wedding rice\". Many vegetarian dishes. Any  dairy on the menu is goat in origin so if you don't like the taste of Billy Goat then you won't like those dishes. The ambiance is great. The second floor is more comfortable and hip than the first floor. The staff are attentive."}
{"text":"Love love love. Been here a few times, every time is perfect. The yogurt is so fluffy / light. Need to figure out how to cook meals served at this restaurant. So flavourful."}
{"text":"If I could give it 4.5/5 I would everything was amazing food, service and atmosphere. It only loses 1/2 star as portion sizes are small for price. Cocktails are delicious the fox went perfect paired with entrees, and the Rose was perfect dessert cocktail. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about menu and all of the wines was able to make perfect suggestions so we allowed her to select all menu options. Looking forward to visiting Byblos again!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and drinks. 
3.5 stars for the atmosphere. 

The food is incredibly delicious, we ordered several plates and everything was better than we expected. 

The drinks are very creative too, rose flavored arak was my favorite. 

Our waiter was very professional friendly. 
Though I felt the place is a bit loud and noisy, and slightly darker than I would like a restaurant to be. 

Overall very good experience and I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Im Lebanese and have family from Byblos. Believe me when it comes to Lebanese/Mediterranean cuisine I only rate the best.

In the last 5 years of living downtown This place is one of the best restaurants I have ever been too

The decor is simple and comfortable yet very appealing and nice on the eyes. The staff is extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and beverage items on their menus. Ask them for recommendations, YOU WILL NOT BE LET DOWN.

The service is polite and professional and timing is good considering everything is made fresh from scratch. Their sparkling water is also top draw!

Now for food. Where Do I begin. Simply unbelievable taste and great design/presentation. It certainly makes you take notice when it arrives at your table. I was sitting in a slumped position and immediately sat upright, taking notice if the food once it was brought to our table. 

Everything is made properly all the way down to the tiniest ingredient and detail. We ordered 6 plates (labneh, dumplings, Snapper, Brussel Sprouts and Seared Cauliflower) and only ended up returning one (mjedara rice) because it was deemed by us and the chef as having too much cinnamon. No worries though as we were politely comped straight away no problem.

The manager was even nice enough to touch up on our table at the end to ask us how our dining  experience was. 

This place deserves 5 stars. However I will be giving it 4 because I feel like they could address two issues: 1) their sign on the outside is too small. It doesn't catch your eye immediately. It could use a rework. 2) It is customary in Lebanese/Mediterranean Class Fine Dining Cuisine to be presented with a parting gift on the house (pastry/dessert or fruit of some sort) upon the receipt of your bill. The portions themselves dont have to be generous as it is the thought/idea of the gift that counts.

But as it stand This place deserves a solid 4.5/5 Stars.

I HIGHLY recommend you check this place out if youre in the mood for Mediterranean cuisine and fine dining. Its pricey but you DEFINITELY get what you pay for.

Will be visiting again with family next time for sure. Cheers."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't think I would've suggested this restaurant on my own fruition. I had suggested it for my boss and her friend to go based off of their inclination and preference for dining experiences vs just eating to survive. They loved it so much that her friend sent me an email the next day to thank me and my boss was equally as grateful. 

I came here with my boss and the food was delicious. I dinged one star off because I believe the food is overpriced, especially for the portion sizes. The flavours are delicious don't get me wrong, but I don't think I would have volunteered to pay for such an extravagant meal.

So my recommendation would be to come here if you don't mind spending the dough. But if not, there are plenty of other cheap and cheerful options in the area."}
{"text":"Great date spot. Dine to impress.

We had no reservations but were seated at the bar. The restaurant was packed on a Monday at 8pm.

We had the following:

Basturma Pide
Fattouche
Mejadra Rice
Slow Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder (3/4 lb)

For the two adult men, this meal really stuffed us well. But all in all, there wasn't anything spectacular about the food given the price. The lamb and rice were great to have with the variety of sauces and pickled sides they brought over. The pide was ok at best (my coworker was reminded of pepperoni pizza...), and I don't even remember having the fattouche.

This and the two cocktails came out to ~$150 CAD.

We had a friendly bartender who was attentive. The bar was full-service/full-menu."}
{"text":"SUPERLATIVE! I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. It is modern, sleek, hip, trendy and just gives an all around great vibe. The music was even awesome. 

We started off with the Rose as a beverage. The drink included Ketel one vodka, Dillon's rose gin, pomegranate, rose, lemon and hibiscus. The drink had an arousing scent due to flowers and taste better than it looked. We ordered from the \"SHARE\" side of the menu which would give us an opportunity to try several different dishes. 

The Middle Eastern Fried Chicken - I really don't know what I expected, but this was delicious. All parts of the chicken was fried into little balls and served with a red schug hot sauce. Just magnificent!

Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous - This is the best couscous I have had in my life. It consisted of collards and halloumi. I could have had several orders of this stuff. It was excellent. 

The Lamb Rack - Initially, the rack was brought out rare and we had to send it back. Once they brought it back cooked medium as we requested. The lamb was well seasoned, tender and juicy. 

Thrice-Cooked Fries - The dipping sauce for the fries is what made them unique. They were very good as well. 

Pizzelle - This was a very good way to finish the meal. This dessert is baklava ice cream, salted caramel and couscous praline. The look of the dessert reminds you of a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. We had to let it soften up a little, but it was heavenly. 

The service was impeccable and if you're ever in Toronto you must stop and enjoy the overall experience of this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was acceptable although the service was bad. I am suspicious of the sharing concept as it seems to be more to the convenience of the kitchen than customers - it allows them to bring out the food when they want rather than in the sequence that works for customers. For example, they could provide the option for people to have the food in courses. The waiter didnt seem particularly knowledgable about the food or the wine options and didn't seem really bothered as to whether you were having a good time or not (although this attitude is to be expected in trendy Toronto restaurants). 

To sum up - ok food but not a fine restaurant."}

Almost everything I ordered:

Roasted Beets
Fig Salad 
Green Beans
Roasted Lamb Shoulder for Two
Orange Blossom Mousse
The Businessman
Amaro Nonino - on the house, for my birthday

...and all of it was five stars."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the food u have here !!! Less quantities for even the large portions ! Food was ok to taste , nothing fancy about it to be overrated ! Lots of other restaurants serve more and better in both quantity and quality ! Not coming again."}
{"text":"The lamb was exceptional, and so were the desserts; we had several of them and with the exception of the Qatayef, they were perfect.

The steak tartare, duck kibbeh, and labneh were decent, but not great.

Service was decent.  My only gripe, is in French and Italian restaurants servers really work to get the right pronunciation of dishes.  Why is the same respect not accorded to Arab cuisine?"}
{"text":"Our food was very nice but our service was awful.  Just super slow and missing out on basics, like leaving my water glass empty for long periods, nowhere to be found when we were ready to pay, that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Byblos is probably my top pick to date in Toronto. It just has the tastiest food. It's that \"next-level\" taste - the one you thoroughly enjoy and are amazed by. The one you still remember and crave. The one you openly (and happily) tell all your friends about. Byblos is THAT place. And while it's not cheap - it also doesn't break the bank. Especially when you know what to order!

My fave dishes here: The Roasted Red Beets Labneh, The Lamb Ribs (amazing!), The Eggplant Kibbeh (tasty!), The Fig Salad (The Fattoush Salad was my fave - but they removed it from the menu!), The pide (can't remember which one though), The Roasted Lamb Shoulder (so tender!), and The Mejadra Rice (simple but yummy!). I love ordering a lot of small dishes and sharing - family style :)

It's a hip, fun (read: can be loud) atmosphere. Service is top-notch. The one downside: You need to plan! Or be lucky lol! It's booked up every night (during regular dinner times) - so reservations are a must! But totally worth it."}
{"text":"I had the Basturma Pida followed by the Wagyu entree.

Both were fantastic. The Basturma I found to be especially good.

Sadly they no longer have the Shakshuka, but the Basturma has Shakshuka sauce...

Hands down favorite restaurant from this trip to Toronto. Great service from waitress as well; extensive and helpful recommendations and explanations."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service! I took a group of eight business people and was a bit nervous about picking a place I had never seen. I shouldn't have worried as Byblos exceeded my expectations in every way. A beautiful restaurant, great service and the food was just incredible. With eight people we ordered a huge number of plates and all of it was amazing. Highlights were the pork shoulder, the lobster dumplings, tuna tartare and the lamb rib appetizer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Byblos is one of the best meals I've had in the City.
We went in a group in which one person had a severe nut allergy, and the kitchen staff was very well prepared to alter their dishes for the group. 

We had the following dishes:
- Hamachi 
- Spanish Octopus
- Black Cod
- Black Truffle Rice
- Seared Cauliflower

The food was unbelievably flavorful, especially the black truffle rice, and the staff was fantastic.

The ambiance of the restaurant is great - very intimate for a date, but also conducive to group conversations.

Byblos is pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Really good food!! Great atmosphere! Reasonable price.. It was our first time there, we weren't really familiar with the food on the menu, wished our waiter would have explained some of the food on the menu... But otherwise really good experience!"}
{"text":"I am part Lebanese so was excited to hear of this new place. I took my girlfriend here a couple months ago and we were very impressed. Every dish that came out was perfect. Ambiance is typical Toronto restaurant vibe which usually annoys me but this was fine. Service was impeccable. Will be taking my family here again in May."}
{"text":"Great vibe - mix of older and young. (30-60)
Delicious food - tapas style. 
Friendly staff. 
Usually very busy but we got lucky and walked in on a Friday night. 

Downside to this place is quite expensive for the amount of food you receive. 

Will definitely be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!! We ordered the boneless fish covered withe vine leaves and it was excellent. The place is very nicely done and the staff very friendly. The roast lamb is must try dish at this place"}
{"text":"Another hype of Toronto. Not a patch on Otto Lenghi's Mediterranean cuisine. Sexy but lacks the real Mediterranean substance. Good for a visit. Forget the Mediterranean taste, just feast your eyes with the scenery and you are done.

{"text":"Actual rating: 4.5

Lucky enough to snag a table here after I messed up our Open Table reservation. The hostess and manager were very friendly and accommodating from the get go. 

It took us awhile to find the place, partly because it was our first time in the city and partly due to the small sign on the side of the building that can't be seen well at night. Once we walked in, we immediately fell in love with the shabby chic decor. Perfect date night lighting. And to top it off, it smelled just like my grandmas kitchen. 

It's a family style place, and dishes are meant to be shared. We ordered the short rib kebab, middle eastern fried chicken, crispy confit duck rice, and seared cauliflower for the two of us. Our short rib came out separately from the rest of our food, which is the only reason why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars. It was delicious, but we were unable to enjoy it in combination with the other dishes which was really disappointing. We hoped that perhaps the manager would apologize or give us the opportunity to have it again with the rest of the meal, but that never game to fruition. The rest of our order came out at least 30 minutes later. A pretty big annoyance. 

Apart from this snafu, everything here is quality and delicious. None of the spices or flavorings are too competitive. I do wish the chicken had a little bit more za'atar, but otherwise everything was well complemented by each other.

Topped the night off with one of the most amazing deserts of my life: the pavlova. What a show  to have them crack open the milk crumble to reveal the strawberry sumac sorbet. The crumble melted so perfectly in our mouth with the sous vide strawberry that I literally felt paused in time and space. Surreal. 

An overall fantastic addition to our Toronto trip, albeit a minor hiccup."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 18 for a Birthday party and can't say enough good things about the service! They split the bill no problem amongst 18 people. They asked if there were any allergies and I notified them that I have a dairy allergy - they were more than accommodating! They made sure that each course had a separate dairy-free option AND made sure that someone came by the table and explained what the meal was. Thank you for such amazing service!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner. The venue and decor is really nice. I ordered the crispy squid and spiced olives. The other girls ordered mussels, Brussels, lamb, cauliflower and dumpling. I wasn't a fan of the food at this restaurant. It seems like every good had Indian spices in it that didn't blend well together. The spiced olives were my favourite. We didn't expect every dish to have the spices to it. It was very strong. 

We were given a warning because a couple friends were running late. They said they needed the table by 9pm - which we understood and honestly didn't plan to stay there for three hours. 

I would rate the taste of the food a 2/5. Venue a 4.5/5. The customer service a 2/5. I would not come back to this restaurant. 

All six of us did not enjoy the food. We were really disappointed considering we came here based on reviews. 

Happy we got a birthday cake though! I didn't like the cake."}
{"text":"Staff is very accommodating and well knowledge.  Food is amazing.  Highly recommend their appetizers and their fish main course."}
{"text":"I went there for my brother's birthday . I have been trying to get a reservation for a while and I finally got it and was excited to try since this restaurant is very hyped . Guess what , it's one of the biggest disappointment I ever had . The server took 10 minutes to explain how all dishes are small and we need 6 dishes . Starter range from 15-30 and main from 17-65. And she said that since they are very small and does not come with any size . Oh well ! We ordered the eggplant dumplings , truffle pizza , lamb braised in basmati rice and a lentil rice . The basmati rice with lamb came in a small plate and I was not sure it that was a joke or not . Then the pizza which was tiny thin one inch slice -4 of them only . The rice was average and not sure why I would spend 19 dollars for it . I have ate at atleast 30 Michelin restaurant around the world, and I think I have earned some right to critic some food . I was just disappointed and so was my brother . On top of that , I told them it's his birthday but they had no gesture or did not even wish him
Happy birthday . Their entrance was so crowded , we could barely got out . The service was at best salesy. If you enjoy really good food , find some local Lebanese place , they have much better food with great quantity and better price . With this price point I suggest you go to some other place and save your money and disappointment ."}
{"text":"Great family style Mediterranean food. Came here for a birthday and shared the cheese acharuli, tuna ceviche, the lamb, mejadra rice, sesame cauliflower (amazing!!) with two others, we all enjoyed how tender and flavourful it was. The atmosphere in this restaurant takes the cake though. Made up of mostly booths it is the perfect place to feel comfortable while enjoying great food. I would definitely return to Byblos!"}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best dinners I've had in a long time. Absolutely incredible. We were so busy eating we didn't take any photos. Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"Excellent light dinner. Pleasant surprise on our first night in Toronto. We had the tuna ceviche w/squid ink chips (light, flavorful start - would definitely order again); fig salad (good but not as wonderful as the other items); stuffed barramundi (boneless, tender w/ an assortment of interesting flavors) and the Brussel sprouts (seared cheese was a bit too salty but not objectionable - we ate every last bit of it). Yogurt mousse for dessert was not on par with the rest of dinner but that could be because I am more a savory person.  My husband really like the English bottled beer."}
{"text":"The flavours of the dishes at Byblos is so delicious and elevated. The lamb is one of my favourite dishes, go with a few people to share it! most of their apps are amazing but I'd say definitely don't miss out on the Spanish octopus dish and the tuna avocado ceviche. Service is top notch of course!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner.

Excellent dining rooms, and a great vibe. This place advertises as 'family style' but it's really more like tapas because the portions are small. What it lacks in size however, it makes up in deliciousness.

We had ribs, eggplant and one of the funny breakds to start, then friend chicken, octopus, cod, couscous and a side of brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. Fried chicken done to perfection in a nice tangy breading with sesame seeds. Octopus was nice, chewy - but not too rubbery. Couscous was actually my fave dish, comes on a 'bed' of greens, cheese and sayce so when you scoop the couscous it comes loaded with goodness. Only thing that did not blow me away was the cod. It's wrapped in grape leaves - which leaves fish nice and moist, but I didn't love cutting through grape leaf to get to my fish. Whatever. Everything else was amazing"}
{"text":"Byblos was amazing. We only had time to eat once during a brief visit to Toronto, and we are so glad we chose Byblos. Service was perfect, all staff were very knowledgable about the menu. The specialty drinks were creative, unique and tasty. We had lambs ribs (best lamb ever), the quail egg and cheese brioche, duck fat fried cauliflower, manti dumplings and three times fried chips (best frites ever). Sadly we had to leave before we could try dessert. If we ever come back to Toronto, we'll be back."}
{"text":"A meal here is like a trip to the Mediterranean lands. Very dish/drink here resembles a painting, it's so beautiful. It was also a very expensive meal but totally worth it.

I found the restaurant to be a bit dark, maybe it that's just me, I prefer well lit places. There were four of us and we ordered a lot of food. 
-Organic House Labneh: This was so refreshing! It's like greek yogurt but better.
-Lamb Ribs: They were so well cooked that the meat just slipped off the bone
-Steak Tartare: It's a bit more flavoursome than the regular, I prefer this one!
-Roasted Brussels Sprouts: Good!
-Seared Cauliflower: The best! This is very creamy and rich so make sure you have space left :)
-Whole Boneless Branzino: I was a little disappointed by the size, it comes under large but it's a not enough for four. Also this was my least favourite dish.
-Dry Aged Ribeye: Really good!
-Mejadra Basmati Rice: My favourite! Its a perfect partner to all the meaty dishes. It's very strong in flavour so if you don't like cinnamon, you won't like it.

Everyones favourite drink for the night ended up being the Gulab, its rose flavoured and is a beautiful and tasty drink. This drink alone makes me want to come back! For desert I had the Yogurt Mousse and it's the best! If not for the amazing flavour, definitely try it for the beautiful presentation.

We ended up paying $200 for four people but we had food left over. I'll definitely be coming back, nothing makes me happier than paying for something that's absolutely worth it! :)"}
{"text":"Small portions and alil pricey but Delicious food and every dish had a flavourful palette."}
{"text":"The eggplant kibbeh was impressive! I've always wanted to say that! 
- Just kidding. I had no idea what kibbeh was until I tried it here... I'm pleased to say that I'm now a big fan!

Byblos was easily the most interesting restaurant and offered the highest quality food we ate during our 1-week stay in Toronto.

The meal was certainly on the pricey side, but even at these prices I considered the experience to be a good value.  If you want something a bit special... a bit extraordinary... I highly encourage you to try Byblos."}
{"text":"Excellent food choice and drinks were top of the line.  Very impressed with very fast service.  Friendly and upscale.  Will definetly return when I'm back in Toronto"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious!!!  Highlights - crispy couscous, steak tartare, house laneh is a MUST. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Amazing food, cocktails, service, ambiance, and décor - definitely looking forward to coming back to this restaurant again! 

I shared 6 dishes (including dessert) with just my boyfriend and it was definitely the perfect amount to get us full. We ordered the turkish manti dumplings, lamb ribs, black truffle wood fired pide, roasted brussel sprouts, short rib kebab, and pavlova. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: black truffle pide, lamb ribs, and turkish manti dumplings. The black truffle pide was the perfect level of cheese, truffle oil, and truffle shavings - tasted like an elevated naan bread. The lamb ribs were so tender and rich in flavour, and the sesame coating was a nice finish. Also, the turkish manti dumplings had such a deliciously unique flavour and texture - not what you would expect from dumplings. I would ONLY recommend the short rib kebab paired with a vegetable dish, like the brussel sprouts; it seems a bit on the dry side to enjoy on its own. 

For cocktails, we enjoyed the geographer and the rose (gulab), both of which were delicious. I personally enjoyed how light and refreshing the geographer was, whereas the rose (gulab) had a stronger alcohol level and taste. 

The service was amazing, and the servers were extremely friendly and willing to offer suggestions/recommendations. They were also able to help me surprise my boyfriend with the dessert I pre-ordered (although the server accidentally missed the note under my reservation). The décor is elegant and simplistic, with my favourite being the round booths and hanging round light fixtures. Overall, a very intimate restaurant perfect for dinner dates, birthday dinners, or small groups. 

TIPS: Make a reservation beforehand because this restaurant is very popular. When ordering, remember that it is tapas style (sharing dishes) and ask for recommendations if you're unsure what to get or how to pair your food! Also, I recommend a table upstairs for a quieter setting. 

NOTE: For 2 people, including cocktails, dinner came to total about $130 before tax. Without drinks, it would likely be $50 each."}
{"text":"An absolutely exquisite meal! Came here with a party of three... Although my expectations were high coming into the restaurant, the food still well exceeded my standards. I was completely blown away! We reserved our table well in advance (a month ago), so this was a long awaited meal.

The waitress told us that the style of Byblos is sharing plates, and that roughly 6 plates would be needed to serve the three of us. Naively, we told her that since we had small appetites, we shouldn't need six plates. Little did we know... The food was so addicting, and the portions were fairly small, leading us to order round after round after round.

We started off with a couple appetizers, outlined below.

Turkish Manti Dumplings:
I've heard so many different things about this dish - some people love it, others find it too bland. We loved it! The flavours were super complex; although being completely vegetarian, it didn't taste it at all. The eggplant had a rich smokey flavour that accentuated the dish. The creamy halloumi and tangy yogurt balanced the salty flavour of the eggplant. I didn't really taste the sweetness of the molasses, and really enjoyed the crisp dumpling surface contrasted with the creamy sauce. 

Fig Salad:
The first and foremost flavour that jumps out at you when eating this salad is the floral taste, stemming from the orange blossom vinaigrette. The tangy vinegar had a very delicate blossom undertone; I could truly taste the fragrance and perfume of the orange blossom. The figs added a nice touch of sweetness; however, there were very little pieces. When we brought that up to the waitress, she was kind enough to accommodate and brought us a dish of a fresh fig cut up. The fig was delightfully fresh! I liked this salad - however, given its high price point, it was a small portion with few ingredients.

For the mains, we had a variety of different dishes such as the following.

Tah-Dig:
This is a classic Mediterranean dish with crispy rice, and surprisingly small for its ingredients and price (I think I'm seeing a trend). That said, the rice was addicting crispy and delicious! The lamb was braised to be fall apart tender, and the warm figs highlighted and lightened the meal. The nuts were a nice addition. 

Grilled Whole Banzino:
This was by far my favourite dish of the entire meal! It was my first time having chermoullah, a pesto-like savoury salty sauce. The parsley and cilantro green dressing with the lemon juice really lightened up the grilled fish. The skin was also the right amount of crisp. I was amazed by this dish, and ate every single last piece.

Ora King Salmon:
We didn't have enough, and so ordered this additional protein. The four pieces of salmon were grilled to a perfect char, rendering the skin crispy. Meanwhile, the salmon was cooked just right - the inside was moist and tender. It was the perfect pink, and by no means dry. The harissa sauce was a lovely spicy addition. Though good, it didn't stand up to the banzino for me.

Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous:
This dish was very similar to the Tah-Dig in that it was likewise crispy. That said, I enjoyed this dish so much more! The creamy halloumi with the collard greens was absolutely delicious. I'm not a fan of cheese, but this and the Manti Dumplings really won me over.

We ended the meal with a dessert. We couldn't decide between the baklava and pavlova (both executed in fusion style), but the waitress recommended the baklava.

Stuffed Baklava:
This dish had mint ice cream stuffed inside crispy pastry (similar to a cannoli), sprinkled with pistachios and topped with a dark chocolate mousse. It was an interesting mix and juxtaposition of flavours and textures - the crisp of the pastry and pistachio contrasted with the creamy mousse/chocolate and ice cream. The sweetness of the dark chocolate and ice cream was cut by the sudden addition of sea salt. To be honest, this dessert wasn't my favourite as the salt caught me off guard. However, I did enjoy the dark chocolate and pistachios. Most certainly an interesting dessert style.

This place is quite pricey, so save up! Moreover, come with a larger group to both split the cost and share more things. Next time, I will definitely try the pavlova (the table next to us seemed to thoroughly enjoy it) and the sweet jewelled rice!"}
{"text":"Wowowowow! I really LOVED Byblos. Finding it was a pain in the arse, but it was worth it.

Reservations are definitely required, as that is the first question they ask you when you walk in. Yes I did and they brought me upstairs which I think is the more \"formal\" dining area, while the lower level is the bar. It feels a bit more cramped on the lower level, so I was glad I was put upstairs and by a lovely circular table.

I was immediately offered a complimentary beverage and it was YUMMY! Our waitress was so great and recommended dishes that the table enjoyed thoroughly. Highlights were definitely the Truffle rice, Turkish Dumplings, the little juicy quails and surprisingly a Tuna Tartare of sorts with delicious black chips (squid ink I think it was?)

The vibe was awesome and I can't wait to come back here again! I would highly recommend this place to take out of town guests as it has the right combo of great food, unique décor, and a jiving vibe which promises for a great evening."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences in Toronto. Food is all yummy to damn good! 
Tried: Artichokes, Turkish bread, ribs, ribeye, thrice cooked fries and baklava ice cream 

Service: friendly and helpful
Ambience: upstairs is prettier (and like the bar).

QPR: 3 glasses of vino, cokeand above dishes, w/tip came to 250$. Needless to say the two of us were stuffed!"}
{"text":"Visited on 8/22/2017.  Another work trip, another sight-eating adventure.  While I was on the hour long commute from the office back to downtown Toronto, I came across Byblos as it was consistently highly rated on Yelp, TripAdvisor, and OpenTable.  I did not have reservations because it was a last minute decision for me to either order room service, or press my luck and hope for an open seat at the bar.  I decided to call ahead, and once they confirmed their availability, I dashed over and was seated immediately around 8pm.

I was greeted by a very attractive and personable bartender who spent a few minutes getting to know me (maybe because everyone else at the bar was staring at their phones).  This is always appreciated because I know eating alone while traveling can take some people out of their comfort zone.  She even shared a few of her favorite local rooftop bars for tomorrow night, and if women like her frequent those establishments, I know I will not be disappointed.

I rarely indulge in Middle Eastern cuisine, so she spent plenty of time walking me through the entire menu, giving me recommendations on what dishes paired well together.  I knew that I wanted to try both the Lamb Ribs and Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, so she suggested the Turkish Manti Dumplings and Seared Cauliflower.

The ribs and dumplings came out together first.  I've never been a huge fan of lamb (a little too gamey for me), but these might have been the best and most tender ribs I've ever had in my life.  The dumplings were very creamy and paired together perfectly with the spice of the lamb.

The last two dishes came out approximately 10 minutes after I cleaned off my first two plates.  Unfortunately, I was only able to sample a few bites of the chicken and cauliflower because I completely underestimated the size of the restaurant's plates.  She recommended 2-3 plates per person and commented that my order of 4 plates was a bit aggressive.  Oh well, I happily boxed the leftovers, and now I have a solid late night snack after the rooftop bar tomorrow!

Side Note: Go easy on the hot sauce that comes with the chicken, it's already spicy enough.
Cliff Notes Version: Come to Byblos for the great bartenders and lamb ribs!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Just came for my first time, I love the decor and ambience. Service was attentive, our food all came out at different times but it didn't matter as we shared plates.

Only knocking a star off because I wished the portions were slightly bigger for what they cost - highlights were definitely the crispy artichoke and mejadra rice. Fries are amazing too, excited to come back and try more dishes next time."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Ordered a few smaller items as our meal:

Shakshouka: Spicy Tomato + Yogurt + Duck Egg + Romy Cheese 

Lamb Ribs - Dukkah + Buttermilk Sauce + Carob Molasses + Red Chili Schug

Salmon Kibbeh Nayeh - House Turkish Paste + Mint + Labnah

Crispy Qatayef - Ashta Cream + Honey Syrup+ Sumac Muddled Strawberry

The Shakshouka and Salmon were great, but the Lamb Ribs were a little too sweet. The Crispy Qatayef was the best part of the whole meal!"}
{"text":"The outside looks simple, but nice comfy interior decor. 
Great for small group to share. All dishes were amazing! The flavours were on the point"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Byblos for our anniversary dinner. I'm vegetarian and the menu looked delicious and very veg-friendly, and we'd only heard good things from friends. 

Overall, I really liked the food, but there were a few negatives that soured the experience for me. We were seated on the second floor, which was a lovely space - I really liked the decor and lighting. Unfortunately, a freezing cold draft managed to get up from the outside door on the first floor and the space was unpleasantly cold. With winter being about 50% of the year in Toronto, they need to find some way of keeping the space warm, even on the coldest of days.

Next, the service wasn't great. The waitress had a \"resting bitch face\" and was kind of bossy. We wanted some guidance on the menu, but before asking us what caught our eye, she went on to tell us about all her favorite dishes. She was good about pointing out vegetarian dishes and we decided on 4 veg dishes to share and a lamb dish or my husband. The first thing that came out was the crispy eggplant, which she said was vegetarian, and came out with cured meat on top. The annoying part was when we told her, she didn't seem apologetic at all, said that the eggplant wasn't cooked with the meat (very reassuring!), and then asked if we'd like another one without meat. 

The food itself was delicious overall: we ordered the crispy eggplant (delicious, but not served piping hot, plus the whole meat fiasco), watermelon, mint and haluomi (sounds better than it tastes; the cheese was a bit too rubbery) beets & labneh with flatbread (delicious), Turkish dumplings (THE BEST FRIGGIN THING EVER), lamb ribs (husband loved), and brussel sprouts and haloumi (a good side dish, though the brussels could have been cooked a bit longer). For dessert, we had a semifreddo with entire cardamom cloves - so overbearing and barely edible. Thankfully the sorbets were better - pomegranate (a bit watery, but tasted like real pomegranate) and turkish coffee & chocolate (AMAZING. would eat this every day). The Moroccan mint tea was just a tea bag....I was expecting real Moroccan-style tea with mint leaves and sugar, and this was not it. 

So...while I would go back, this first experience did not live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"very disappointed - came here based on the reviews on Yelp for a friend's birthday.. we were a group of 6.

we had made reservations for 6pm in advanced and we were seated upon arrival. Our group arrived separately, and a few were a little late due to traffic which we told our server about. 

around 6:10 the hostess came by and said \"I noticed your whole party isn't here, we still require the table back by 9 - this is firm\" the attitude wasn't necessary but the time restriction was fine because we weren't planning on being there that long anyways. while waiting, we felt like we were being starred at by the staff, it was quite unwelcoming.

when the rest of the party arrived, Tara came
back and explained the menu to us in detail and answered any questions that we had. 

It's unfortunate that 6 people had the same opinion about the food - there wasn't nothing tasteful or great about it. 

Here's a list of things we had:
- lamb ribs
- vegetarian rice 
- 2 servings of the eggplant dumplings 
- mussels (had to pay an extra $5 for bread!!)
- calamari 
- spicy olives 
- Brussel sprouts 

all the food ended up being shared and everyone had the same opinion, it was okay but definitely not satisfying. we were actually discussing where to go next to eat to be satisfied. 

our favourite item was the free dessert the birthday girl got.

We had to wait an extra 25 minutes for the rice to come out after the error made by the waitress and the wrong one was ordered! 

definitely not a place I'd return too."}
{"text":"We had a table of 4 and ordered 12 side dishes and each couple shared 1 entre which was the dry aged steak and lamb. I must say every dish was flavorful and the meat dishes were very tender, especially the lamb. Very busy and happening vibe on the 2 flr and more subdued on the 1 flr. Of course we enjoyed a nice bottle of greek red wine to enhance the Mediterranean flavors and finally polished the night off with 3 desserts - the hazelnut chocolate mouse was divine. Bill was $600 but definitely worth the experience. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best  fusion mediterranean restaurant ever! and best customer service as well.
The only DOWNSIDE is that they do not answer the phone which makes booking an apt at the same day is very hard to do !
If they fixed that issue I would definitely give them 5 stars !!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great atmosphere and wonderful food. Their menu is a decent size and the prices as well as portion size are very good for sharing as well. Some of our favourite dishes are; lamb ribs, rice plates, cauliflower, eggplant dumplings, and their fish (which I forgot the name of the fish because I tried both of their fishes) both were good. You definitely need to make reservations however even when we took a bar seat once, it was still very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is so refreshing! The food is so damn good. I wasn't a big fan of mediterranean food, or so I thought, until I came and experienced it here. Everything was so flavourful, and presentation was on point. Love the interior and the ambiance of the venue. Make sure you come with a big appetite, and have dinner \"family style\"."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner!  Amongst other items, We tried: 

Lamb ribs - flavourful, moist and tender
Turkish manti dumplings - cute and yummy, nice spices 
Beets with bread - smooth, great balance of flavour and textures 
Cornish hen - so moist!  Comes quartered 
Qatayeh dessert - subtlety sweet, creamy, crispy dumplings. Our fave dessert of the night 

About $110pp total with wine   

Absolutely fantastic customer service by our server last night.  Young guy with shower dirty blond hair who served our table by the windows, gave excellent suggestions.  Wish I remembered his name so I could give him kudos here. 

Really  tasty experience, would definitely recommend and come back again. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The beet salad with barbari bread, Trabzon, black cod wrapped with grapeseed leaves, jewelled rice, Turkish dumplings, and Loukoumades for desert.  Every dish was 5 stars accept for the Turkish Manti dumplings.  These dumplings were okay but too rich and the wrapping was slightly doughy.  The rest of the dishes was the right blend of savoury and sweet. Would love to go back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I'd go as far to say that this was one of the best meals I've ever had, for multiple reasons. 

The service was fantastic. Efficiently timed, our glasses never went empty. And beyond that - the waitress was provided suggestions about ordering/pairing certain dishes that totally made our meal. We were told to order a dish from each section, and the portioning was perfect.

We started with the citrus mixed olives and the crispy artichokes, followed by the fig salad, the black truffle flatbread/pizza, the Turkish dumplings with the recommended rice, and the roasted brussels sprouts with haloumi cheese. Loved every single dish, and would have to say the dumplings were probably the biggest hit.

Loved it all, right down to the decor + tiles on the floor!"}
{"text":"This place. This place! Incredible. Beautiful building, amazing service. It makes me smile. And the food is an experience. I sat at the bar by myself, and enjoyed a couple of recommendations, the tuna ceviche and the fig salad. The flavors were complex and light. A gorgeous display of how food should taste. Brilliant. 

I was (easily) talked into dessert. Clayton, the bartender, recommended the Loukoumades. Exceptional. Burnt honey ice cream, halvah, and little puff pastries. Dare I say...better than chocolate. 

If you're in Toronto, check this place out. I would walk there in the snow, uphill both ways."}
{"text":"I liked the food even though it was like Canadian version of mediterranean cuisine. I ordered crispy couscous, turkish manti and pide. Everything looks really delicious but my manti and pide were just good whereas couscous was great! Such a simple meal but I loved it!
Service was good, well informed and happy to help.
I spent really nice time there but for the food you get it's way overpriced."}
{"text":"Our bill was astronomical, but the food was not.

I'm actually quite disappointed. We were told that \"share portions\" were quite big, but it was actually minuscule. The pictures of the dumplings are quite deceiving. The flavor was alright, but not amazing enough to justify the price and wait.

We ordered the fish main; it was way too charred. The artichoke yogurt was literally 1 dollop of yogurt with fried artichoke. The rice dish was mediocre. The chocolate mousse and the fried dessert were both unimpressive."}
{"text":"We went for diner right after it opened and the food was really tasty! It is a little on the pricy side, but it was worth it. I am definitely going back.
The service is great: don't mind the two people that seemed to be the owners/partners walking around with grumpy faces.

We had the duck kibbeh, beat labneh (comes with bread), grilled octopus all were amazing! We also had the ribs which were very good as well but the mixture of so many ingredients masked the taste of the lamb. The jewelled rice was a split: I LOVED it and thought it was very different and flavorful while the person with me hated it but thought it was worth trying since it is exotic.

The portions were small (as the menu says) so it ends up on the pricy side. Also enjoyed the Gulab a lot. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants in Toronto. The food is incredible. Great wines as well. It's so hard to choose your food because you will want to order it all (twice we've had the server order for us)!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, my husband and I visited Byblos for an early meal before attending a Tragically Hip concert. We didn't have a reservation, but because we were in long before the peak time, we didn't have a problem getting seated. 

At the recommendation of our awesome server, we ordered the tea punch service (I don't recall the exact name; apologies if that's incorrect) and then checked out the menu. It was difficult to decide between all of the tasty options, but we finally settled on the steak tartare, crispy squid, seared cauliflower, and thrice-cooked fries. The food arrived a bit before our cocktail, which was a bit odd, but I think this was because the place was pretty empty at that hour. (It filled up quickly during the time we were there.)

All the dishes were lovely. The cauliflower and steak tartare were clear standouts. The texture of the tartare was unique and absolutely perfect. I think the squid would have been slightly better if they cut the squid thicker (they were kind of like squid fries in this context), but that's a minor quibble. When the tea punch did arrive, it was wonderful: sweet and complex. We ended the meal with coffee and tea and called it a night. It was a great start to a fantastic evening."}
{"text":"BOMB!!!! Cornish hen flavoring was so unique and refreshing.  Unlike any flavoring I'd ever had and I've been to Istanbul.  The fig salad was fresh and delectable.  The lamb was sous vide, so tender, and the seasoning was again, unlike anything is ever tasted.  The Qatayeh desert was outrageously delicious, and the waiter so kindly paired it with a Rum called Zacapa, which was perfect!!!!  Boss Man:  give Callum a raise. He is top notch. Great attitude and awesome advice.  It was also quite affordable.  $80 American before tip."}
{"text":"Came here intending to have dinner for two, instead the two of us ended up eating what felt like dinner for a family of five. 

Our strategy for ordering was to order everything with the words \"duck fat\" in it. I'd advise you to do the same. 

Won't be writing too many individual comments to the dishes below, everything was delicious - order it all. 

Sharing Dishes: 

Duck Kibbeh - duck stuffed grain ball; delicious
Eggplant Kibbeh -  the vegan kibbeh choice; if you don't have dietary restrictions and deciding between the eggplant or the duck kibbeh, go with the eggplant
Organic House Labneh - flat bread and yogurt dip; worth the carbs
Roasted Brussel Sprouts - green balls, yum
Seared Cauliflower - cooked in duck fat, need I say more?
Lamb Ribs - perfect amount of game
Spanish Octopus - octopus was more cooked than preferred; dish wasn't too inspiring; this is the only dish that I may consider substituting for the next time
Yogurt Mousse - an innovative dessert served with cotton candy 

Overall: 
Food: 9/10 -superb food, I plan on coming back and working my way through the menu
Service: 9/10 - water service could use just a touch of improvement
Atmosphere: 9/10 - lots of seating with cool modern décor.  
The only caveat is that using the bathroom will be a mid-meal workout if you're seated upstairs. 

Eat here - trust me."}
{"text":"Byblos food is not something I would crave but it is nice to try at least once in a lifetime! Great flavours that my palate have never been exposed to. Definitely on the more expensive scale and the portions can be shared but are not huge.  The entrance is discrete and looks like it leads into a nightclub. The interior is very beautifully decorated.

Lamb ribs ($14) were well seasoned and had a great crunch from the nut coating. As other reviews stated, you get 4 ribs and ours were more bony than meaty. The Turkish manti dumplings ($14) were much smaller than I imagined them to me but were tasty carb-laden bites. The sauce was delicious and I wanted to mix it with everything. 

The branzino ($38) has been highly reviewed but it was disappointing for us. The entire fish was wrapped in grape leaves and grilled which was neat, but it was much too salty. We had to keep neutralizing the saltiness with the Persian rice that we ordered."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and was pleasantly surprised. We got the Roasted Lamb Shoulder for Two , Creamed Spinach wood fired pide and Spanish Octopus.  

All were very good especially the roasted Lamb Shoulder for Two.  They gave us a bunch of wraps and condiments where we can make our own mini wraps.  Portion was huge too.  The Creamed spinach pide was tasty as well and cooked to perfect crispiness.  

Overall will def come back in the future."}
{"text":"This is definitely in my top 10 Toronto restaurants, perhaps even top 3!!! The menu is amazing gorgeous space chic modern dimly lit great music. The cocktails are almost too pretty to drink! There is something on the menu for everyone. Many of the dishes are best shared, my fave way to dine. Love this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Very good ambiance upstairs in the bar\lounge area. The service and food was excellent.  Perfect sharing plates! 

Small Plates: 
- Lamb ribs were delicious - 4 pieces 
- Beets Yogurt honey dip - my favorite.  Came with bread to dip in the yogurt honey spread.  3 pieces of beets 

Large Plates: 
- Oxtail Basmati Rice with Kale and yogurt
   I found this dish very strong tasting and got a side of yogurt to cut the salt and heaviness of the oxtail.  It was perfect! 
- Side - Cauliflower cooked in duck fat mmmmm 

I really wanted to try the burnt honey ice cream but was too full!  Next time!"}
{"text":"Had several items including the eggplant kibbeh, crispy artichokes, fried chicken, black truffle rice, lamb kebab, dumplings, and the green beans.

The dumplings and the aritichokes (w/ the bread that comes with it) are deliciously creamy; the fried chicken and the lamb kebab were tender and tasty (I especially loved their take on the chicken).  The other items were good but nothing special.

Would definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"Wow. This was one of the most amazing meals I've had in a long time. It's quite pricey but I think it's well worth it. The cocktails are incredibly creative and artfully made. We got the steak tartare, oxtail empanada things, hen of the woods flatbread, black truffle rice, and short rib kabob. I would say the oxtail and flatbread were my favorites, but everything was amazing, both in terms of flavor and texture. The food is sort of like a tapas-style, so go with multiple people if you can to try as many dishes as possible."}
{"text":"Phenomenal restaurant that surprises me time after time. Don't be thrown off by the eccentric plateware, this restaurant delivers a level of refinery, flavour, balance, creativity, and finesse that you would never expect from a family style restaurant. I would recommend my favourite dishes, but every dish on its menu is amazing so you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience from start to finish. 

To begin with, the place is charming. Great location and just a beautiful space. I lived in the Middle East for 9 years and the bar/countertop brought me right back to hot summer nights there. The service is incredible. The table was ready and waiting for us, and every staff member was attentive. All of the food is brought to your table with an explanation - and if you arent familiar with middle eastern spices, meats, and cheeses then you truly get an education about what you are eating.

On to the food! For two of us we ordered:

- beets on a bed of labneh
- crispy squid
- shakshouka
- jewelled rice
- Cheese Acharullii
- yogurt mousse and qatayef for dessert

This food is incredible. Small plates but very filling. Every dish is unique with a plethora of flavours and textures. Its beautifully presented and you can tell that care is taken with every component.

This place has a lot of hype and I was hesitant that it would meet my expectations. It definitely did. It's a place that draws you back in to try all of the other dishes because you are curious about them. 

Other restaurants in Toronto need to follow this place for their impeccable service. When every single person on your team is on point, and is very knowledgeable about the food - it makes your dining experience that much more pleasurable. 

Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a modern middle eastern restaurant. A bit overrated in my opinion because as a middle eastern, I was expecting an authentic taste but I guess they are aiming for modern and fusion dishes.

Cozy place and perfect for a date.

I may give it another chance to try different options."}
{"text":"It was pretty good.  Definitely on the pricier side.  Nothing really jumped out at me overall.  The decor and vibe was really nice.  I think for me, its a nice place to grab a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"If you want to go out just for the sake of being at a nice location regardless of how the food is, then Byblos is the place to go. Although we had quite a variety of dishes , we did not like the food at all. The portions are tiny and the food is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED. We had the Lamb Ribs, Chargrilled Cornish Hen,  Middle Eastern Fried Chicken (they were actually not bad), Sujuk Pide, Chanterelle Mushroom Pide, Crispy Confit Duck Ride, Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous, and some drinks. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The food at Byblos is absolutely delicious. We were a big group and came here for a birthday - the only complaint is that they make you do a set menu if you are a large group. We ended up negotiating a minimum spend for our group (which was not cheap) but I do have to say, it was worth it. 

Try the fig salad and the lamb shoulder. The birthday girl has a gluten intolerance and they were incredibly accommodating. 

If you are a large group, try to avoid the fixed menu. I found the best part was tasting the various dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great place for a night out with friends. Menu offers a wide variety of choices and a good selection of cocktails."}
{"text":"The food at Byblos is phenomenal and unforgettable. I have been twice now and both times I've been so very pleased with the experience. The setting is intimate, cozy and comfortable. You can carry on a conversation without raising your voice. The service is excellent: friendly, helpful and attentive. I highly recommend Byblos for a wonderful and unique dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food experience - sophisticated serving & decor. Best Turkish coffee I've ever had (outside of Turkey)!"}
{"text":"Every single dish we tried was perfect! Also great services - they gave us awesome recommendation cuz they really know their menu!"}
{"text":"Our second dinner at Byblos was if anything better than our first several years ago. Superb flavours in every dish.There were four of us and we shared 8 dishes, all of them standouts. Bravo to Byblos for sustaining the excellence in food and service. My only quibble would be the loud noise level - but I am older and have a lower tolerance."}
{"text":"Ordered some dishes from yelp's review... not my taste..
This place is good for dating~"}
{"text":"The boys are back. On March 13, Charles Kabouth and Hanif Harji unveiled Byblos, their newest and most exotic Toronto restaurant.  The main floor of this heritage building has lots of \"wow\" appeal, from the mosaic tile floor to the majestic service bar. Order cocktails like Arak Ritual-prepared table side-Kafe Turke or The Ten Suns.  I watch the actions of the staff, meticulously garnishing the hors d'oeuvre that surprise us with hits of Levantine flavours.

Jet setters will recognize spices they've encountered in their travels to Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Israel. Up the stairs is the spacious second floor with extraordinarily comfortable curved leather banquets and booths.  This is where serious taste-testers will congregate and enjoy selections from an extensive menu of small and large plates. Trust Chef Stuart Cameron (Patria) who knows exactly what to do with seasonings like dukkah, preserved lemons, harissa, za'atar, mint and saffron. His small and large plates will entice you to order the entire menu.

Byblos has been opened for dinner since Monday March 17th. Go there."}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants in Toronto that I would go back over and over again.
Cucumber and mint swizzle is refreshing, perfect for summer days
Lamb ribs are perfectly seasoned and easy to pull apart.
Black truffle rice is filling and flavorful with an interesting texture.
All time favorite is the yogurt mousse cake topped with cotton candy. Simply to die for. 
Friendly staff, great music n ambiance."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Visited Byblos for the first time... and left a little disappointed. 
Was it the hype? Was it the 4.5 average star reviews on Yelp? Probably a bit of both.

I came by Byblos on Monday night (6:30 pm) to a surprisingly more empty restaurant than I imagined. Reservations to this place are hard to get, but it seemed like I could have easily walked in and gotten a table. 

What we ordered-

1) Lamb Ribs: These were delicious... but SMALL. Seriously, why did no one else on Yelp mention how small these were? Pictures can be very deceiving. At first, I was surprised lamb ribs were $14 at a high end restaurant, but it made sense when I saw them. The dish was 4 lamb ribs, each barely 4 inches long. Now again, these were delicious, the seasoning on them were very good, but it wasn't anything too special. Lamb ribs are naturally delicious. 4/5

2) Roasted Beets: This was the stand out dish of Bylbos. It was amazing. It came accompanied with a side of bread that was seasoned similar to the lamb ribs. The bread tastes great with the cheese and olive oil. It's almost Italian-like, as it really reminded me of a burrata dish. Also, don't let the \"beets\" part scare you off. My girlfriend and I don't like beets, so we almost didn't order this, but the beets really were not the focus of the dish... the cheese and bread are. To comment on the beets itself, they were delicious, but they were even smaller than the lamb ribs. 5/5. Order this. 

3) Turkey Manti Dumplings: My girlfriend really looked forward to this dish. When she had the first one, I could tell she was disappointed. I tried it next, and I could understand why. The flavour was good, but it was... very lacking. The dumplings don't have a lot of filling, it was mostly dough that tastes good because of the yoghurt sauce. Some dumplings didn't have any filling at all. We left this plate half eaten. Not sure why it was highly touted on Yelp. 2.5/5.

4) Crispy Squid: It's good but c'mon... it's fried calamari. There's really nothing much else to say about it. Fried calamari is always good isn't it? But... is it traditional Mediterranean food? I dunno. Probably not. 3.5/5.

5) Tartufata: Being Chinese, my parents would be pissed off if they found out I spent $30 on rice that didn't even have any meat in it hahaha. Anyways, this was a rice with mushrooms, chick peas and truffle. It was tasty because the aroma with the truffle was very good. We mainly used this to compliment the squid, dumpling sauce and cauliflower. Hard to rate... I'd say a 3.5/5 but I would not recommend this. The value just isn't there, and their other rices seems more interesting in hindsight. 3.5/5.

6) Seared Cauliflower: This sidedish was cauliflower seared with duck fat. I'm a little hesitant to give Byblos credit for this dish because you can take any vegetable and sear it with bacon fat, steak fat or duck fat and it'll taste good. I personally liked this dish because I'm into strong flavours, but I can see how others can see this dish as \"fatty\" or \"heavy\". Regardless, 4/5.

7) Loukoumades (Dessert): This dessert was great! It is essentially a bunch of small fried timbits surrounding icecream, topped with edible flower petals and burnt honey. I don't even like desserts and I found this to be excellent. Strongly recommend this if you're going to get a dessert. 5/5. 

I want to warn you about the service. It's really slow. I came on a relatively quiet Monday night and my server did not do very well. It took a long time to do anything like taking our order, bringing out our food and bringing us the bill. 

I like the fact that someone will describe to you the dish when it arrives, but it wasn't done as well as Lee's restaurant. The servers at Byblos just spew out memorized lines really fast, instead of actually educating you about the dish or how to eat it. Go to Lee's and you'll see how they do it much better at explaining their dishes. 

Would I come back? Maybe. There's a couple things left on the menu I want to try but would I rave about it to my friends and coworkers? No, there's better places to spend your money or to celebrate an occasion."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

Was looking forward to this place given the high reviews but in the end I felt that it was quite overhyped. 

Sure, their dishes were packed with flavour but overall the execution was a bit lackluster. The whole meal was just a mouthful of the same few spices from start to finish and did not leave a feeling of satisfaction and comfort.

There were a couple dishes that were decent such as the lamb ribs, house labneh and the yogurt mousse cake. 

Service was great and the waitress offered their honest opinion about the dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Our friends have been to this restaurant before and knew the menu very well.  We heard there are some misses and so we basically ordered everything they suggested.  

There wasn't a dish I didn't like!

All the plates were beautifully presented.  I think we had 9 small sharing plates and the Cornish hen.  We also had a rice and the crispy couscous.  Flavourful dishes with a range of tastes and textures.  

Service was impeccable.  My cocktail was excellent.  

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone.  It will lighten your wallet but considering the level of food preparation and attention to detail, it was worth it.  

4.5 stars (but only because I would want to try more of the larger plates to get a better sense of their cooked proteins)."}
{"text":"All is great at Byblos : the food, the atmosphere, the staff!
I love my duck kibbeh:)
A must go!"}
{"text":"Hands down my new favourite restaurant. Ever.
The minute you walk in, you can sense a chic but comfortably quirky vibe going on, especially with the contemporary-mediterranean theme of the restaurant. The lighting is a bit dim, but it doesn't even matter by the time you get to the food. The food was on a whole other level...literally heaven on a platter. 

The way we ordered was shared-style, meaning everyone got to try everything... this is the suggested way of dining. And I'm so glad we did this! Each dish I tasted (everything from their appetizers--olives/roasted beets/duck kibbeh/brussel sprout salad--to their rice and bread--persian, spiced gulf shrimp, black truffle, creamed spinach--to their mains--lamb, fried chicken, branzino, cornish hen) was SO DAMN delicious!! I liked absolutely everything...*the cornish hen is a MUST try though!!

Unfortunately did not get to try any desserts, but I'm willing to bet they're delicious as well.

Service was great. Be sure to make reservations though, they seem to always be super busy! (Had to eat at 5:30 on a Sunday).. Byblos is on the expensive side but I think the experience was worth every penny. Will definitely be coming back here again. And again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, atrocious service. Our waiter was aloof, got our order wrong (the octopus never came), and left our water glasses empty for most of the meal. He would also disappear downstairs for large stretches of the meal... 

In addition to this, we were seated right by the door THAT WAS NOT CLOSED (there was a temporary outdoor second door designed to help mitigate the cold in winter but is meant to be used as a double door with the main building door SHUT). I had to get up several times to draw the heavy curtains that kept some of the heat in, but was freezing for the entire meal. We asked the hostesses to make sure that the curtain remained drawn, but they did not make any effort to do so...

Great food (albeit not inexpensive) ruined by terrible service. I hope their heating bill gives them their just desserts."}
{"text":"Had a truly delicious, unique meal at Byblos. 

I came with a group of 5 and sat upstairs, which is less lively but more \"atmospheric\" than the main floor and better designed for larger parties. Make sure to ask where you're sitting when you book, as we had some issues selecting a seat upon arrival. 

Our server was friendly and relaxed, and she readily helped us navigate the somewhat confusing family size/tapas mixed menu. 

Everything we had was next level delicious - the cocktails were strong and tasty, the short ribs were tender and flavourful, the octopus (a smaller dish) was perfectly cooked, neatly sliced for easier appetizer consumption and well spiced, and the rice was a big portion of surprisingly \"interesting\" food (read- lots of veggies and flavour). I particularly recommend the lamb dish- it's big, falls right off the bone and has a wonderful smokyness to it, plus it comes with fixings to make tiny, entertaining tacos.

The veggie sides should not be discounted; the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts were both outright noteworthy and I only wish we had more of them. Only the salad was kind of \"regular\", but regular was far from not delicious. My party polished off the whole meal with embarrassing excitement.

Highly recommend!

Reservations are recommended- this place fills up fast."}
{"text":"Great dining experience all around! Beautiful restaurant, genuinely friendly service, and food was unique and delicious! Looking forward to going back to try other dishes on the menu..."}
{"text":"There were many restaurants that I would love to go on special days, especially my birthday. Byblos is one of them. It was a great place and a perfect spot for dating. Their food & drinks were fantastic, unique and flavourful!  I fell in love with it. Indeed! ^^

Byblos was one of many restaurants that Soleil S. (Yelp Elite) suggested me. Thanks to her ;).

Now, let's get started!

FOOD 
- CRISPY BABY ARTICHOKE  (5/5).  The dish comes with house labneh (yogurt cheese), preserved lemon, olive oil and house bread on the side. The baby artichokes were golden and perfectly crispy. They were delicious and went well with the labneh and bread. Honestly, I like their side bread so much. I could eat a few of those bread by myself without any dipping. ^__^  I wish I have it every day. 
My husband and I agreed that this dish was the best of today food. We would recommend it!

- BLACK TRUFFLE RICE (4.75/5). The 2nd best dish of the day.
It comes with truffle paste, foraged mushrooms and creme fraiche. It went well with the Cornish Hen. 

-  CHARGRILLED CORNISH HEN (4/5). It comes with sabzi sauce, toum (Lebanese garlic sauce) and fried leek. I like the Cornish Hen more than the Seared Cauliflower. However, my husband (chicken eater!) preferred the Cauliflower dish than the Hen one. 

- SEARED CAULIFLOWER (3/5) with duck fat, tahini sauce, sesame and coriander. I felt that the cauliflower was too soft and mushy. Umm..mushy? Maybe it was because of the sauce? 

DESSERT
- PAVLOVA (4/5). The presentation was great. You've got to break the meringue shell to eat the strawberry sorbet and milk crumble underneath it.  I love the combination of strawberry sorbet and milk crumble.  Perfect for the night! They also wrote \"Happy Birthday on the plate for me.  THANK YOU! 

Drink
House wine & coffee (4/5)
- We actually ordered the Turkish Coffee because I wanted to try it.  Unfortunately, the server said they ran out of it. So we got a cup of Americano coffee instead of Turkish coffee. Everything seemed to be perfect till I checked out the receipt later when I got home (I went to a washroom when my husband paid the bill).  The Turkish coffee was still on our bill! 
  
OVERALL (4.75/5) 
As I mentioned, It was almost a perfect night.  Was I glad to come here? Yes, I love the ambiance and the Food.  There are many items that I want to try next time.  Their menu is impressive and unique. I understand that people sometimes make a mistake. Thier service was excellent though. I saw that the manager checked on every table. It was something that made me believe that they care about their customers. I will come back again ^__^"}
{"text":"Byblos is a gem, with fantastic food and ambiance. Highly recommend making reservations since this place tends to be packed. The portion sizes are a bit small, so it's a great idea to order a few apps/entrées for the table and share. The perogies, watermelon salad, lamb and the rose petal drink stand out."}
{"text":"Skip this. For the arm and leg you pay you can get food that's SO MUCH tastier than the food served here."}
{"text":"I love Byblos for its \"pan Mediterranean\" focus and the beautifully executed dishes. It's pricey and you tend to run into a business/theatre crowd. Versatile -- I've been there with my wife, my parents, as well as business functions. Great for business functions with sharing plates; gracious service and knowledgeable servers/sommelier."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  I went with a big group for a birthday and had the family style prix fixe menu ($75 option with 11 courses). To really sum it up, it was delicious and the service was great! They really took care of my cilantro allergy and even went the extra mile to ask if coriander is ok, not a lot of restaurants do that or seem to know that they are actually similar in taste. I hate being a hassle/annoying but they really stepped up. Also the drinks were great and tasty! 

I would recommend this place, it is worth the price tag. However for the more economical it was on the higher side for the portions, and a drink was slightly under $20 with exception to beer. If you come here I would say, prepare to easily drop $70+."}
{"text":"I am already thinking about coming back here! Came to celebrate a girlfriend's engagement, and it was a great experience. Made reservations for a Thursday night, and were seated upstairs in a very cozy corner by the kitchen door. Our server was extremely nice and helpful, and recommended for a group of four to get 8-10 dishes. We decided to do six, but we also had dessert. We ordered the lamb ribs, fried chicken, black truffle flatbread, manti dumplings, black truffle rice, and seared cauliflower . Everything was crazy delicious. The cauliflower was just ok, but I still did enjoy it. The lamb ribs were seasoned so well, but they are small so keep that in mind if you have a larger party. The fried chicken wasn't greasy as you would find it at other places, and it wasn't lacking in meat, either. And bonus, no bones :). I loved the black truffle rice with the crunchiness of the chick peas. The two winners were the manti dumplings and black truffle flatbread. I absolutely hate eggplant so I was apprehensive about trying this, but oh my goodness it was friggin amazing! You couldn't even taste the eggplant in it at all. The yogurt sauce was not overly powered either. Could have ordered ten plates of this! And the flatbread, WOW! I would love to have some right now. The crème fraiche was so delicious, and rich. Definitely needed another one of these at the table as it went by so fast. For dessert we had the loukoumades which is like, their version of a timbit, but a million times better. They were a perfect end to a meal. My friend doesn't usually like a lot of cultural sweets, but she gobbled this down. Also ordered a cocktail which wasn't so bad but nothing to rave about. Can't remember the name, but it had vodka, which I don't usually drink, but was recommended by the server. Such a great venue with beautiful décor and great service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Byblos, like Patria, is the most palatable of high-end restaurants.  What they do is deliver a consistent and reliable pleasant time.  For me to give a restaurant 5 stars, though, it has to be more than overall pleasant, it has to be \"knock your socks off\" good.  I'm not sure that Byblos hit that mark (for me!) although I could how others love it so much.

The room upstairs is beautiful, and I immediately noted that the layout of the tables was some of the most ingenious I've ever seen.  Big booths seating that could fit 2 people up to 8 people, etc.  Very malleable seating (can you tell I work in the industry?).  Service felt a little too pressured to me, he just kept coming back too often.  I felt a bit rushed.  The drinks were amazing, we tried four different cocktails, and I even tried a gin based drink (after finally breaking my decade-long-abstinence from gin at the most recent Yelp Elite event) and enjoyed it.

We had the lamb ribs, but we weren't told/we are stupid that there was yogurt sauce on the bottom of the dish, so pay attention when you're eating.  The labneh was delicious and the bread was great.  I loved the sweet jeweled rice, and we had the yogurt fish which paired really well.  Lots of dishes had cilantro in it, so I couldn't order everything I wanted to.  The cauliflower was okay, I am a HUGE cauliflower fan and I wasn't a supreme lover of it.  

The one hiccup was that the bathroom doors signs are worn off and seriously everyone was so confused as to which bathroom to go into! (Boys are first)

They gave us a birthday dessert and by that point we were so full I wanted to die.  Fun place, just not stop-in-my-tracks for me."}
{"text":"Excellent! 
This restaurant is in my opinion one of the best in the city. I don't remember when was the last time I had such an amazing service and great food.
We were a group of 6 and had the $75 fixed menu. Everything on the menu was just delicious. I know this type of food from my childhood since its the type of cuisine I grew up on. So I was skeptical about going there, thinking that like most Mediterranean restaurants in the GTA, it will just be another boring, uninspired food. Well, gladly enough I was wrong.
Every dish managed to maintain a strong Mediterranean identity with a sophisticated twist. The amount of food you get in the fixed menu is more than generous.
Above all was the service. We had the sweetest, most attending waitress. So good at what she does that one of us actually thought of offering her a job (!).
If you're a foodie, I encourage you to visit Byblos. It's one of those \"must try\" restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious food. Beautiful decor. Fabulous service from the maitre d, to bar to the valet guy. Loved it! I love Lebanese food and this was great. Only ordered a selection of starters/mezze and it was more than enough. Delish"}
{"text":"Really liked the food a lot. Braised lamb was delicious.  Would have given it 5 stars except the wine list was grotesquely overpriced for what they offered.   Would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"Byblos was AMAZING! The service was excellent, the decor was nice, the food was delicious! I suggest making a reservation. I made mine 2 weeks in advance for a Saturday night dinner. 

My boyfriend and I both love Mediterranean flavours, and Byblos brought a really unique twist to every dish we tried. 

We had:

Baked green olives -3/5 tasty, but they are not warm. Just a heads up. 

Lamb ribs - 5/5 OMG these are INSANE. A standout dish. Perfectly cooked lamb with a unique blend of sweet and crunchy seasonings and sauce. 

House Labneh - 5/5 YES this is creamy and delightful. 

Dumplings - 5/5 Incredibly unique and delicious. Stunning presentation, yummy sauce.

Whole Branzino - 5/5 A perfect share size with all the other things we ordered. This is deboned and wrapped in vine leaf and topped with eggplant. It is cooked to perfection and delicious. 

Seared cauliflower - 5/5 Seared not completely fried. Very tasty.

Couscous - 4/5 this is served with wilted greens. If you are not into the bitter taste of greens you may not like this. If you like healthy food, you will. I loved the crunchy texture of the couscous. 

Desert:

The cigar pastry (can't think of the name) 4/5 I thought this was great. My boyfriend (who is more into desert than I am) thought it was okay. 

Turkish coffee chocolate ice cream - 4/5 really strong flavour. 

We had a Greek wine that our server suggested. It was a Merlot blend and went very well with our meal. 

I will definitely return to Byblos. I can't wait to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Fantastic take on Mediterranean food. 
The eggplant kebbeh are really interesting and delicious. The duck kebbeh are also very tasty, while not quite as interesting as their eggplant counterpart. 
The fattouche salad honestly doesn't really resemble its namesake but it was reasonably good nevertheless. 
While the appetizers were really good, the slow braised lamb shoulder is phenomenal. It is delicious and falls off the bone. The accoutrements to build mini shawarmas are incredible. 

High recommend it!"}
{"text":"The place is actually quite easy to miss because the name \"Byblos\" is displayed in fine print at the front lols.  I really love the decor, and have to say that the whole experience has been wonderful, minus some of the food.

Service
Exceptional.  This is like a 4.2/5 experience for service.  Our server really knew the menu inside out and was genuine.  That is key for me in service, don't try to frigg'n upsell me, I'll order what I want.  He kept coming back to refill our water, fix our napkins, and change our plates between each dish.  That's amazing.  When I told him that one of the dishes was too dry, he offered to switch it for another one.  We were too full at that point and politely declined.  All the other servers seemed to be very professional as well.  This is honestly an 'A'-ranking service.  I was blown away, really (what does 5/5 service look like right? lol).

Food
Turkish Manti Dumplings
They are tiny.  I thought they were going to be average-sized like what we eat in Chinese restaurants, boy was I fooled.  The flavour comes off very strong, so don't dip the whole thing in sauce.  Don't try to drink it either lol.  Even though they are very tiny in size, they can fill you up pretty quickly.  Average in my books, though this is raved upon by many reviewers on Yelp.

Black Truffle (Wood Fired Pide)
Godly.  I've been playing a lot of Mobile Legends lately, and whenever you kill off a bunch of enemies, they give you descriptors that really make you feel like a King.  This thing is legendary!  You have to eat it once it comes out, because the cheese and bread combination will melt in your mouth quite literally.  Perfect combination, super soft, and you get to taste all the flavours.  I gave this 9/10.  I would come back for this dish.  The cheese is not overwhelming in anyway.

Black Cod
At first glance, I thought the leafs were not edible but my boyfriend ate it anyways.  I have a feeling Byblos likes infusing a pinch of sourness in every bite, but that's cool with me as long as it's subtle.  This was quite interesting, and I'd recommend it.  I do have to say if the leafs weren't there and you ate the cod alone, it was like a 9/10 once again. That cod was so soft and tender, I almost wonder if they had cooked it while it was already wrapped under the leaf to obtain that texture and flavour.  Anyhow, with the leafs wrapped and all the sauces on top, it was like 8.4/10.

Organic House Labneh
I thought it was alright, I like how the bread pieces were a little crispy and laid out like rolls of circles.  My boyfriend loved it.  The sauce is a great compliment, but in my opinion, not worth $10+.

Crispy Confit Duck (Rice)
Where did this go wrong?  Oh right, everything.  Too dry, more of a jasmine/basil taste, not entirely appetizing.  While the portions were quite decent, this was a no-no for me.  Just steer away from this dish, it has 'bleh' all over it.  My suggestion, add some type of cream or take it out of the menu.  As my boyfriend would rate it, 6/10."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Byblos. It was my partner's birthday and I chose this restaurant for him because of it's unpretentious and casual vibe and Byblos' reputation for remarkable food and a different experience overall. We began with a ginger negroni (they have negroni on tap). Then moved on to a bottle of cava. The atmosphere was a bit loud and hipster downstairs for me, but the warm decor made up for it.

We began with the labneh which was topped with a beautiful helping of peppery Lebanese Olive oil. We really enjoyed the smooth texture and cooling sensation of this fresh yogurt dip. The Lamb ribs were very good, but we missed out on the buttermilk sauce on the first two as the ribs were stacked and the sauce, being white, was hard to see at the bottom of the bowl. The ribs were tender and spicy, but we both agreed that the buttermilk sauce really improved the overall likability of this dish.

The baked fluke was not a favourite of my partner. He found it a little under seasoned. I liked the delicate flavour of the fish and the flavours they used, but it would have benefited from a little more seasoning. Crispy Calamari was very nice. Garlicky and fried to perfection. However, I might have liked to see this served as a smaller dish as opposed to a larger main.

The jewelled rice was surprisingly fragrant, delicious and sweet with whispers of orange blossom, carrot, pomegranate, edible flowers and almonds. Probably the best rice dish I've ever had. However, I wished that the rice arrived with our mains as I felt weird eating rice by itself.

Our server was wonderful. He was happy to make recommendations and didn't miss beat with anything. I didn't mention my partner's birthday in the reservation as I think it's tacky to request birthday singing at a restaurant and make it your server's responsibility to wish your guest well. When my partner shied away from dessert I reminded him that it was his birthday and the waiter overheard. When our desert arrived it was festooned with a candle and they had written 'happy birthday' on the plate. This was low key and very nice of him.

To sum things up, I found the service to be glowing, the food quite good (but strange coursing of a few items) but I wouldn't go so far as to gush that the flavours were incredible or mind blowing. It was very good at best with a few underwhelming dishes. But the experience was a good one. I might come back, but I think i'd rather sit upstairs next time. My partner enjoyed the casual feel of downstairs, but I found it a bit too loud and the tables were really close together."}
{"text":"My gf took me here for my birthday dinner.  Definitely didn't disappoint.  The menu is extremely creative and not your traditional Mediterranean food.  The yogurt baked fluke was one of the richest, most flavourful fishes I've had.

I made the mistake of skipping over the dumplings that everyone was raving about and had the spanish octopus instead.  Do yourself a favour and skip over that.  It's nothing more than grilled octupus on sliced fingerling potatoes and fairly bland.

The bread is also delicious.  One gripe is the seating layout.  We were 2 and I ended up right beside a huge pillar rubbing on my shoulder.  Despite that, I'd return when my wallet permits."}
{"text":"Yes! Everything tasted fantastic and had a unique twist. We had a really great extended family dinner. Nice space as well (we sat upstairs)."}
{"text":"We really like this place. Beautiful, soft-spoken decor and delicious food, paired with one of the more thoughtful wine lists in Toronto. It's busy and fun, but quiet enough to have a nice spoken conversation. The staff are exceptional - courteous, not overbearing and skilled. We especially loved the recommendations of Krysta, the sommelier. Sometimes the snacks verge on too salty, but that's a subjective thing. We have eaten here three times now, and have never left with any disappointment. I should mention that we don't eat meat, and there were a good selection of dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"This is a unique gastronomic experience. Foods and drinks are carefully crafted and beautifully executed. They offer combinations with flavour you never experienced before. Everything in the menu is worth trying. And sit at the bar and ask for a special drink - the barman really knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. It excelled at all levels from greeting us to the service to the food. I really liked the feel of the place too. 

In terms of the food, everything was outstanding and I lost track of all the food we ordered. It's a place to share dishes so it was great to try so many. The lamb and lebneh both were standouts for me. 

There is no question to put this on your list of places to dine in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love their food! They taste amazing and their staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Bylbos twice.. the first time on a rainy weekday evening, early around 7pm without reservations. Service was excellent and attentive. We had the lamb ribs (my favourite lamb dish EVER!!), bread with yogurt dip, a rice dish and turkish dumplings. The food came out quick and well paced between dishes. All the servers described the dishes in detail, it was impressive!

My rating goes down a star for the second time i visited.... honestly, if it wasn't for the food I would've rated it even lower. We had reservations for 9:45pm on a weekend and ended up having to wait while our table was cleared to be seated, about 10 min. The bar was crowded so we couldn't even get a drink while waiting. When we finally got seated, it was really busy but it felt pretty awful to sit and wait while our server tended to tables directly to either side of us without even stopping to greet us. It took another 10 minutes for someone to greet us (still not our server) and ask us if we wanted drinks. We were seated between two parties of 6 and it was just my bf and me. There was absolutely no 'romantic' ambiance, would've been better if we had been there with a party of 4+,

After we ordered drinks, we waited another 5-10 minutes for our server to notice us! She finally did, after about 20 minutes we received our drinks. We ordered steak tartare (delicious), crispy squid (my other favourite!),couscous (waste of money, tasted disgusting with hard to chew spinach or something green in there), rib eyed steak (deeelicioussssssss!) and lamb ribs (i think i came back just for these lol they were just as good this time). 

I'll come to Bylbos again but likely with a bigger group of people, the seating isnt set well for couples or parties of two. I hope that server gets some training because she really lacked attentiveness and general warmth/friendliness you expect from servers. She got better midway filling our water without us having to ask, etc. but still pales in comparison to the service I received during my first visit."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 3, made reservations about a week in advance 

Service and ambience were really good, more of a casual dining vibe. But more importantly, was the food any good? Below outlines the 7 dishes and 2 desserts we tried as a group of 3. Their recommendation of 7 to 8 dishes for a party of 3 was spot on. But also depends on the dishes you order. 

Overall good experience and would definitely come back. 

Lamb Ribs with dukkah + buttermilk sauce + carob molasses + red chili schug
CAD$14.00
-these were just okay. I don't understand why everyone raved so much about them. Slightly dry but the flavour was okay. Nothing special about them. Came with 4 small ribs. 3/5

Crispy Baby Artichoke with house labneh + preserved lemon + olive oil
CAD$14.00
-this was really good! This came with bread topped with cardamon or some sort of spice for dipping. The bread was yummy and the labneh with crispy fried artichokes was delish. 5/5

Sujuk with turkish paste + persian feta + za'atar
CAD$12.00
-This was OK. Nothing special about the dish. It was a very skinny piece of flat bread filled with sausage and a sauce. Would not order this if I were to return. Very small portion with no flavour profiles other than the sausage and bread. 2/5

Turkish Manti Dumplings with smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molasses
CAD$14.00
-The dumplings were really good. The eggplant inside the dumplings were very flavourful and the dumpling skin wasn't too thick. Yogurt sauce paired perfectly. 5/5

Spanish Octopus with fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemon
CAD$19.00
- typical octopus dish. Nothing really noteworthy or special about this dish. It was cooked well and an ok sauce that could have used some more acidity. 3/5

Wagyu Striploin with cauliflower hummus + amlou dressing + veal jus
CAD$46.00
- this was pretty good. The Wagyu was cooked perfectly medium rare and the cauliflower hummus was a really good accompaniment. Although when all mixed together, the sauces hid the beef flavour. 4/5

Black Truffle rice with truffle paste + foraged mushrooms + crème fraîche
CAD$24.00
- as everyone says, their Rice's are really good. Good texture and lots of flavour. You immediately get the truffle flavours. Good portion size. 5/5

Crispy Qatayef with sumac strawberry + honey syrup + turkish delight + ashta cream
CAD$11.00
- this was a little plain Jane. It came with 4 small fried pierogi-like dumplings will with the cream. The strawberries were nothing special either. 3/5

Turkish Coffee Bomb with coffee cardamom mousse + cherry confit + hazelnut dacquoise + borek
CAD$14.00
- this was really unique and delicious! It's sort of a cake with a crispy bottom filled with a cherry confit liquid, covered in a dark chocolate. Only complaint is that it could have used much more coffee flavour as that's what you expect from the name. 4/5"}
{"text":"The best Middle Eastern food I've had in Toronto... Hands down! We've come here a couple of times, tried a bunch of direct things each time and haven't been disappointed with anything so far. My personal favorites are the eggplant manti dumplings, the fried eggplant and the mejadra rice. 

The music, the decor, the ambience, the warm hospitality... all help create a wonderful atmosphere that makes got want to come back for more. Again. And again."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Byblos. The food was delicious, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place - the ambiance is great, and the noise level is good, even when full (i.e. you won't lose your voice talking to your table mate). Service is good, the food is dreamy, and they have many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim before one of the Luminato shows. I am so glad we did. What a wonderful experience. The service was superb. The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, preparation and ingredients and spoke passionately about her favorites, describing flavors and textures in almost intimate detail.

The food did not disappoint. From the homemade bread, redolent with herbs and sublime olive oil, to the luscious shakshouka and labneh to dip said bread into, to the tender eggplant dumplings, flavorful and correctly cooked arctic char, and the delicious cauliflower, we were completely satisfied. The chocolate mousse and house-made sorbets were delicious and the perfect ending to what was a stellar meal.

I cannot wait to go back to Byblos. I simply loved it all! (And from me, that's very high praise.)"}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is really nice. Its truly a beautiful and calming place but if thats all you want from a restaurant. The food on the other hand is not worth it at all. We ordered 5 dishes for 2 people and you need to order at least 5 dishes for 2 people to share to feel like you ate something. The portions are extremely small! Even the 'large' dishes they have listed on the menu are small. We ordered a side of green beans, there were like 10 green beans for $8, the Turkish manti is usually made out of ground beef, but here its stuffed with eggplant, that was $14, with like 10 pieces of small manti (dumpling). They call it middle eastern food but putting a few names of middle eastern spices on the menu doesn't make your food better. Overall, the food wasn't extravagant. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excited by the preceding reviews, had a lovely reunion dinner with family and a particularly splendid meal. The service was quite attentive and sensitive to allergies, and that included everyone who served us. 

Every tapas-style dish was well-seasoned and complex and so palate-pleasing!  Too bad we're just visiting Toronto. Would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"A delicious and impressive representation of the Eastern Mediterranean seaboard!

So, yes, Byblos has an Ottolenghi-esque Middle Eastern fusion vibe. Although there may soon be a backlash regarding the \"Middleterranean\" trend and ubiquity in Toronto, it certainly won't be coming from my end. This kind of food is my steez. Food that is simple and extraordinary at the same time. Food that dazzles your senses and simultaneously nurtures and comforts you. 

I would like to try most things on the menu at Byblos and it is definitely a source of inspiration for my cooking at home.

The fig salad with orange blossom honey vinegar + ackawi cheese +kohlrabi +pistachio is one of my favourite salads right now ($14). The simple side dish of roasted brussel sprouts with halloumi+tahini +yogurt ($7) is addictively good. Enough has been said about the generous and interesting rice dishes but I will echo the masses anyway; they are both eye-pleasingly beautiful, as well as pretty tasty! The fluke is a fine fish dish ($27). I must try some more meat dishes (e.g. dry aged ribeye with za'atar butter and smoked eggplant $41). 

There are too many dishes to mention, but I will add that you should save room for the dreamy dessert menu (plus Turkish coffees and teas). 

My last points: 
1. fantastic service
2. portions are a good size, you won't be disappointed
3. nice but the opposite of stuffy
4. music can be a bit loud at times 
5. great open prep area; think trays of figs, a bowl of lime and paprika dusted Marcona almonds and busy chefs working away

If you enjoy this food, Byblos is a warm and inviting space that you will likely return to over the years for various occasions."}
{"text":"Last year I went to Cocktail Parlor, and was amazed by the food.  Then I found out they closed and so I hunted down the chef to see if he had another restaurant.  Lo and behold, Executive Chef Stuart Cameron was doing his thing in the very same building at Byblos.  I love middle eastern food, so I was so excited to try it, and lucky me after talking about it for a few months my boyfriend surprised me for our 6 month lunaversary last month!  

You can either order a large plate and eat a meal, or you can go tapas.  We decided to go tapas so that we can try more dishes. 

Our Plates:
Basturma Egg: Get this. Just do it.  It was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten!  My boyfriend said it took him back 20 years to his childhood in the middle east! I asked for the egg a little bit cooked more because I find runny egg repulsive and they were able to accommodate me.  BF wanted to order another one and our server was like.. wait.. you have lots more food coming... and oh boy did we ever!

Duck Kibbeh: The spices in this were like BAM! It was delicious! The texture was perfect, we both just wanted to eat more.

Steak Tar Tar: The STT was very good.  Not mind blowing like the rest of the meal, but very good.  If you like STT then get it.  The Barbari bread on the other hand.. I wanted more!  It was sooo delicious!

Yogurt Baked Fluke: This... I'm not totally in love with fish usually, I can eat it here or there, but our server highly recommended it, so I got it.. I bow down to him.  It was... just wow! Yes. 

Dry Aged Ribeye: Very good.  Pales in comparison to the fish, but very good. 

Hand Rolled Couscous: I took a bite.  Then I had to stop eating and breath.  The browned butter in this.. OMFG! It was overwhelmingly phenomenal! I was seriously blown away, and I almost cried. I'm not kidding.  It was just the greatest! It made me so happy.  It was like love had been injected into this dish. 

Sweet Jeweled Basmati Rice: This is the most beautiful dish you will ever see in your life.  The colours and textures and tastes.  It's a masterpiece!  You must get this.  Don't ask me any questions, just do what I say! 

Our Desserts: 
Kanafeh: The ice cream on this was awesome!!  The Kanafeh itself we found a little dry.  It was.. fine. 

Crispy Qatayef: These were delicious.  Cute little dumpling morsels of goodness.  Yum!

Our Drinks: 
Gulab: I'm not much of a drinker but decided to celebrate, and yummy yummy!  What a choice.  This beautiful glass was filled with mostly ice and a pretty flower, but the drink that was inside was delicious, and I nursed the ice for a while since it still had some of the taste of the spices!

Some citrus drink: I forget the name: It was excellent!  I think I may have even liked it better than the Gulab. My server recommended this one since it was light on alcohol flavour and heavy on awesomeness.  

Some Ginger Drink: BF says when I asked him just now how he liked it.. he said very excitedly \"Oh ya... the drink was great!\". 

The service was outstanding! The atmosphere was simple, elegant, and beautiful! 

We're going back in a few weeks for another celebration and we can't wait!  It's all we've been talking about for a month!

GOOOOOO."}
{"text":"I constantly catch myself thinking of my visit to Byblos because of their unique, bold flavours. Their prices are quite steep but what can you except from a restaurant in this area? The ambiance is very hip and modern with sofa seats that are arranged so that all friends and family can sit comfortably however close you want to. No need to fumble around with heavy chairs and worry about your purse falling to the ground.

Customer service was impeccable - the waiters were very knowledgeable of the ingredients as well as the cooking process of each dish. The dishes just seemed that much more special when you got a spiel on all the work that went into it.

I went with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner and we ordered the lamb ribs ($14), turkish manti dumplings ($14), sweet jeweled basmati rice ($19), yogurt baked fluke ($27), finished with the burnt honey and turkish coffee ice cream ($3/each). 

The lamb ribs appetizer comes with two ribs, making it a small, unfilling dish but it tasted amazing! I would recommend it for anyone making a visit. It was very soft and the meat just fell off the bone. The turkish dumplings were covered in this unique sweet sauce that took me a few bites to get accustomed to. My initial reaction was that it seemed a bit weird, but as I continued eating it, I couldn't stop. It was a nice sweet dish to have that contrasted well with the other food. The jeweled basmati rice was an exciting dish that tasted as unique as it looked. There was a crunch to the rice and tasted faintly of orange blossom (not something I get to taste everyday). I would have to say that the fluke was the least exciting of them all. It wasn't cheap but the flavours weren't anything special. Plus, it was a bit smaller than what I expected. Both the ice creams were amazing in my opinion. Some reviews below said they liked the coffee ice cream more, but I couldn't get enough of the burnt honey ice cream! The coffee ice cream had a bold, intense flavour, perfect for black coffee lovers.

I would love to go back but until I make more money, I will just have to constantly relive the moment in my head!"}
{"text":"Very hard to put into words the impressiveness of this incredible culinary establishment.  While much of today's chef-owned restaurant vanguard chases the latest trends in hipsterized comfort foods,  Byblos quietly works away harnessing and perfecting the limitless scents, flavors and textures of the Mediterranean.  The result is a mesmerizing blend of creativity and authenticity.   Cardamom, honey, pistachio, fenugreek, paprika and preserved lemon grace everything from your Manhattan to your vegetable sides to your desserts, creating an amazing depth of flavor to each item that will have you planning your next trip before your main course arrives.  Entrees are executed to perfection, and the service is flawless: our waiter spoke with the knowledge of a seasoned chef, confidently explaining the intricacies of dish preparation and elaborating on the flavor and texture combinations.

In a city that has no shortage of \"wow\" factor, Byblos is one more notch to add to your belt.  Worth every penny or more, and if you happen to be traveling on the US dollar, one of the best big city culinary experiences for the price you'll ever have."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! This is a very intimate place, the open kitchen is awesome. The service was great and the wine selection was perfect. This is the kind of place that would impress a date and is also perfect for girls night out or a special dinner. You can eat very healthy here too - that is also a big plus.

Order this and you won't regret it.

Start with:

FATTOUCHE
Cacik Dressing + House Shanklish + Heirloom Tomato + Cucumber + Sumac

SHAKSHOUKA
Spicy Tomato + Toum + Duck Egg + Romy Cheese

LAMB RIBS
Dukkah + Buttermilk Sauce + Carob Molasses + Red Chili Schug

PERSIAN STYLE FRIED RICE
Sujuk + Rock Shrimp + Green Peas

and then whatever large dish (meat) you love..

Pistachio Ice Cream! Of Course!"}
{"text":"Food was great and special. But noise level was way too loud for any kind of conversation if you are not sitting right next to each other. Will not recommend for romantic or friends hangout - leaving not much options going there. I wish the noise level can go down a little bit so everyone would have the chance to enjoy the overall dining experience more."}
{"text":"Byblos was crowded, on Tuesday evening! We did not see one empty table, which must give you an indication of the quality of the restaurant, even though it has been open for the best part of four years. Our experience was good, though with the odd poor spot.

Some measure of the quality is indicated by the crispy sesame encrusted and lemon fragrant bread which comes to start.
We had the crispy artichokes which were a real delight, warm with a sweet element and plenty of them. As our waiter recommended, we had the eggplant kibbeh - beautiful, soft, fragrant. The chanterelles flatbread was a complete disappointment - very salty, hardly tasting of chanterelles  and otherwise indifferent.
The octopus were tender and good tasting but rather overpowered by a Piri Piri like sauce. The rack of lamb was cold, and certainly not worth the $42 pricetag. The cauliflower and brussels sprouts veggies were great and well worth trying even if they were a bit salty.

Service was polished, professional, and informed.

The wine list is comprehensive, we had a wonderful Sancerre for$90, followed by a Cote de Nuits ($125). Both of these were excellent"}
{"text":"A solid 4 star restaurant. Such a cozy, romantic date-night place I can see why this is a top trending restaurant in Toronto. Tried this place out for tapa-styled Eastern Mediterranean food with a girlfriend and it's hard to ignore the classy and rustic atmosphere here. Absolutely gorgeous and cozy place with round tufted leather couches and exquisitely plated food as scrumptiously tasting as it looks. Hidden off of Duncan Street but just steps away from the Royal Alexandra and Princess of Wales Theatres near St. Patrick Station, I would absolutely come here again. 

Taste - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Atmosphere - 6/5
Portion - 3/5

Taste - 4/5 - We ordered the Roasted Red Beets, Lamb Ribs, Spanish Octopus and a side of Seared Cauliflower. Everything tasted amazing. The Red Beets came with Barbari Bread and olive oil in the middle of the redbeets and Labneh so it was a good starter dish. The Lamb Ribs were cooked to perfection as the meat just fell right off the bone so effortlessly and was deliciously sweet and garnished with just a pinch of red chili. My girlfriend and I love seafood so we ordered the Spanish octopus but the taste of this dish didn't really stand out to me. The seared cauliflower is quite heavily sauced and seasoned so it was a bit too much for a vegetable dish for me.  

Service - 4/5 - It took a few minutes for someone to notice me at the front when I entered. I had made a reservation here a few hours prior online using open table so after giving them my name they seated me with my girlfriend upstairs. Our waitress came shortly after and was very helpful and guiding us in our selection of items from the menu. She was also very knowledgeable in the ingredients that went into each dish and gave us some really good recommendations. 

Atmosphere - 6/5 - This place is top-knotch in its decor, space planning and ambiance. The lighting is very romantic, candle-lit/dim and the area we were seated in on the second floor had tufted round leather chairs - very cozy! There is a trendy bar area on the second floor and this place looks like it could be quite a good spot to grab a drink with a friend or co-worker after work. 

Portion - 3/5 - Since me and my girlfriend don't eat alot we ordered three apps and one main. I think she was full but I think I could have had perhaps one more dish as the tapas are quite small and offer only bite-sized portions. This is definitely not a place you want to come to if you are looking for a heavy fulsome meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! From the food to the ambiance to the friendly staff, everything was awesome! Make sure you make reservations early, as the restaurant does get very busy.

All the plates are tapas style and designed to be shared. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person. So just beware that although the prices look reasonable per plate, it does add up pretty quickly. Our waiter was great at making recommendations on the portion sizes. For some of the side dishes, it comes with a certain number of said item, so they are flexible to add additional pieces if needed. 

Between 5 girls, we got 5 sides, 3 mains and 1 dessert. This was plenty. Honestly, I thought every dish that we ordered was amazing. But my favourites were the house labneh, black truffle bread, and slow braised lamb shoulder. The house labneh was super yummy, when you dip the bread, make sure you get some of the honey too, because that's what really makes the labneh here unie and stand out. I would also say that the lamb shoulder is a must if you come here. The lamb was really really tender, and very easy to pull apart with the fork. The pork shoulder is served with several different sauces and lavash, so you can make your own little wrap with it. 

I can't wait until the next time I come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, delicious cocktails.  The lamb ribs & manti dumplings are must orders, I prefer getting lots of the smaller plates than the large entrees."}
{"text":"This place is it.  It is IT, if you know what I mean.  But if you don't, read on and I will tell you why Byblos has rocked my world twice in a month and why I will be back.

Firstly, the atmosphere is very cool and there is awesome interior design.  Both times I have been seated in the bottom level and been happy.  You can watch them prep your food and make your drinks behind the bar.

I have tried 4 different cocktails from here and have to say the Gulad was a personal favourite, served in a julip metal cup.  So refreshing!  The Sultan's Apprentice (I think that was the name) was also delicious and the presentation was awesome: a giant square of ice that fit perfectly in the glass.  

The food is just amazing.  There are so many different layers of flavours.  I was so impressed.  Here's the good and the okay:

ORDER THESE:
-Eggplant Kibbeh
-Steak Tartare
-Citrus Mixed Olives
-Guernsey Girl Cheese
-Yogurt Baked Fluke
-Roasted Brussel Sprouts
-Sweet Jeweled Basmati Rice

These were good but not as great as above:
-Roasted Red Beets
-Seared Cauliflower

And these I won't be ordering again:
-Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous (didn't like the texture, boring)
-Dry Aged Ribeye (too dry for my liking, also boring)

Dessert - I've had the Turkish Delight tea, Barbary Coast and the mint....the mint is by far the best.  And for dessert I've tried the burnt honey ice cream (most delicious) and the apricot which was good but the flavour was very subtle.

Delicious experiences both trips - highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is it. 

The restaurant's atmosphere is hard to beat, the right amount of lighting and decor elevates the gastronomical experience. 

We ordered the duck kibbeh, lamb shoulder and Mejadra rice. Everything tasted amazing, with an unique harmony of flavours. 

The hibiscus watermelon sorbet and the white chocolate ice cream were the perfect ending to a delicious meal. 

I can't stress how fantastic the service is, everyone is friendly and go out of their way to make sure you are enjoying the experience.

Last thing: reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for a family dinner because Pai, next door, had a 1 hr wait. Surprisingly, there was no line up here on a Sunday evening. I had been wanting to come here for a long time now, but I can never get a reservation for the time slot I want. You can imagine my excitement when we walked in and got a spot. 

All the plates here are tapas style and designed to be shared. The prices look pretty good at first glance, but you should remember that the portions are small and for 3 people, you are encouraged to get 6-8 dishes. It adds up. 

We had the roasted red beets labneh dip with bread and lamb ribs to start. The dip was amazing and the bread made it that much better. It was topped with toasted coriander and sesame seeds (I love the smell of both). The lamb ribs were good, but my mom didn't like them because they smelled/tasted really game-y. 

We then had the turkish dumplings and mejadra rice. The dumplings were in a sauce and the eggplant filling made it quite mushy. It was tasty, but not what I'd normally expect from dumplings. The rice was incredibly yummy. The dollop of yogurt and fried onions on top were a great touch. The rice was longer grain than any rice I've ever had before. To compliment everything, we ordered the brussel sprouts, which I can easily say was one of my favourite dishes that meal. 

We ordered the ice cream sandwich pizelle dessert - it came with 2 sandwiches. SIMPLY DELICIOUS. Can you tell I really like ice cream yet?

I can't comment on the drinks because we didn't order any, but I watched the bartender make fancy drinks the whole night and admired the wine wall!"}
{"text":"Y-U-M! As the three dollar signs suggest, this place is rather expensive but you can definitely expect a high quality experience right from the moment you step in. The entrance may mislead you to think that this place is a covert underground club but once you're inside, the entire restaurant exudes a warm and chic vibe. Service was absolutely wonderful with friendly and attentive staff, and a comprehensive description of the dishes was provided as they were being served.

I came here for a small family gathering of 5 and we ordered a total of 9 dishes. 
There were so many great dishes that I want to praise this restaurant for:

1) Slow Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder - what words can I use to describe this absolutely mouthwatering hunk of tender and succulent lamb that's been braised in-house for 14+ hours? Fall-off-the-scapula (that's the science-y term for the shoulder bone because they actually gave us the entire scapula!) meat that comes with lavash (little square flatbread wraps), house yogurt sauce, pickles, and sliced beets = to die for! 

2) Sweet Jeweled Rice - fluffy but al dente basmati rice with shredded carrot, saffron, barberries, pomegranate seeds, and almonds. This is a beautifully coloured dish with a delightful hint of sweetness that adds that special element of surprise. 

3) Roasted Brussel Sprouts - honestly, this dish blew me away. The MOST DELICIOUS brussel sprouts I have ever had in my entire life - cooked to perfection for a moist yet crunchy center and slightly crisped outer. It was bursting with flavour and was well-paired with halloumi (type of cheese)! You wouldn't even know that it was brussel sprouts! If you tell me you don't like brussel sprouts, I won't believe you until you've tried it here!

4) Spanish Octopus - tender and seasoned octopus with a superb plating presentation. The portion size is quite small but definitely worth it if you're willing to spend those extra dollars.  

5) Roasted Red Beets - like wow. Coming from a Chinese heritage, I haven't had much exposure to beets so I never really liked them.. but this dish was game-changing for me. It was such a small appetizer but it was oh so worth it. Exquisitely crafted dish that deserves ALL of the praise fellow Yelpers have been giving it. Such a refreshing taste complemented by yummy barbari bread. 

Now, here are the dishes I was indifferent about:

6) Fried Chicken = very standard pieces of boneless fried chicken but a bit on the smaller end. The meat itself was juicy but I found that there was too much batter and the batter was too thick. The \"spicy sauce\" that comes with it was more vinegary than spicy. 

7) Daily Chargrilled Fish (Black Cod) = the cod itself was great, as delicious as expected but I felt that the overall dish was lacking sustenance (perhaps a grain or vegetable side?). The portion sizes of the fish were small and for its price, I would've preferred it to be more filling. 

And these are the dishes I didn't enjoy as much:

8) Eggplant Kibbeh = this was a rather interesting/strange dish - couldn't really place my finger on a specific flavour profile or texture. Not one of my favourites.

9) Shakshouka = in comparison to its menu description, this dish was not spicy, not special, and honestly, not that tasty. Presentation was great but the food itself was not even remotely worth its price. The tomato sauce was overwhelmed with cumin spice and the complementary bread used to dip into the sauce resembled slightly burnt pizza crust. Would not order this again.
 
Overall, I would recommend friends and family to come here for special occasions. The ambiance is super cozy and great for intimate meals or small gatherings."}
{"text":"Byblos has a really beautiful decor, that I works well as place with an interesting menu for a slightly more special dinner. Also, personally for me, their menu is quite pricey so it's a bit of a splurge meal. I think their food in general is really tasty but definitely not every dish is on par with the next and not always worth the price tag, so that's why I gave it four stars instead of five. My favourite dish was their Manti, which are sort of like a type of ravioli or dumpling. They were really delicate and petite and full of flavour. The sauce that came with it, was addictively good. The dishes come smaller and are meant to be shared so definitely go with people who enjoy sharing and are not picky. The service here was really good and the staff was very informative and attentive. I would recommend making reservations in advance as it's in a very popular neighborhood for a night out."}
{"text":"one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Amazing food, cool atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Classy and cozy atmosphere. Sat at the bar for two and it was a nice view of the beautiful bar. Food was delicious- on the pricer side but very unique dishes. Small tapas to share. The drinks were also beautifully made. Got the rose cocktail just for its presentation!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as everyone says it is.

We came here on a weekday, and it was very busy. Fantastic atmosphere and service, I would recommend this as a date place. Make your reservation in advance, as it's hard to get a table.

We were thoroughly impressed with all of the food (except the cauliflower side, which was OK). 

For a party of two, they recommend getting 6 dishes to share (everything is meant to be shared). We got 6, and had some left over.

Here's what we had:

1. Shakshouka: Duck egg in tomato sauce, served with toasted bread (similar to naan). So delicious. Layers upon layers of flavour. Highly recommend. 

2. Tuna Tartare with Avocado (special of the day): This was served with squid ink crostini, and was really good. The tartare was good too, a bit on the small side, and it was actually pretty spicy.

3. Mejadra Rice: This was delicious. Again, layer upon layer of flavour. I was really blown away, it was probably the best rice I've ever eaten.

4. Turkish Manti: This is an absolute must try if you visit byblos. Layer upon layer of flavour, and it was really savoury.

5. Seared Cauliflower Side: As mentioned, this was OK. I wasn't wowed by this, and I can easily say it was my least favourite.

6. Fig Salad: I'm probably biased because I love figs, but this was amazing! I highly recommend getting this salad.

I regret that we were so full that we didn't get dessert! All of the desserts looked delicious. I am really looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"One of the all-time best meals I've had. Have you ever cooked from any of Yotam Ottolenghi's cookbooks? Byblos's food is what I'd get if a much, much better cook than I am cooked from Ottolenghi, and if that notional cook had access to a host of spices that I do not.

If you love Ottolenghi, then you must eat at Byblos."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place induces otherworldly food-and-alcohol-based hallucinations!

The atmosphere is lovely, dark and sparkling. Our server treated us like a dear friend, discussing all of the finer details of the cocktails and menu with us.

The cocktails are damn amazing. We couldn't stop ordering them, we were just too curious about the ones we hadn't had yet! My only warning is that they're highly guzzle-able and you may wind up spending $100+ on drinx alone if you're not careful!

The food is exalted, with beautiful Persian/Mediterranean-influenced flavours. We decided to just go with our server's recommendations, and wound up eating a 4-5 course meal, sharing everything. 

Did we break the bank on this meal? Yes, definitely. But we floated out of there, rosy-cheeked, and have continued to talk about our experience there for weeks after. I recommend this place for ANY special occasion or important date. It's a total win!"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant! Every time I'm in Toronto, I'll go out of my way to eat here at least once.

First of all,  the service and food is always superb. Keep in mind that the food is all meant to share, family style. Secondly, they take OpenTable reservations. And finally, it's located in a convenient location, close to St Andrew Station. You can even walk through the path to get closer to the entrance! 

I love the ambiance of the restaurant. I've eaten twice on the first floor, which is a bit more casual but still very nice. I love that counter they prepare appetizers on! The second floor is definitely more fancy. Either floor would be great for a dinner date!

To start, I will always order a pide. It comes out nice and hot, and every one I've tried did not disappoint. The truffle and cheese one is my favourite. I would also recommend their labneh dip, whether it be their other varieties with artichoke or beets, or the regular one.

The lamb is definitely something you can share between 3-4 people. The lamb is so soft, you can just tear it and wrap it up in the pancakes and toppings it comes with. Really fun and you can customize based on your preferences! I tried the kebab last time, and that meat was so tender and flavourful, mmm. I'd also recommend getting a rice. The portion is decent and the truffle one I tried was quite delicious. And finally, their desserts are sooo beautiful. My favourites include the mousse (which comes with cotton candy on top), pavlova, and their ice creams.

Some items that were a pass from me are the lamb ribs (small portion), the cauliflower side (too salty), and chicken (nothing amazing).

Service is great. Waiters are attentive, make great recommendations, and keep water glasses full. If you don't know what to eat, ask for recommendations! They know the menus best. Also, the waiters are super friendly and always have a great attitude. Once, our cauliflower was much too salty to eat, and they brought over complimentary ice creams to apologize. If that's not service, I don't know what is!

I'm definitely going to make my way to Byblos again when I come back to Toronto. I'm missing it already!"}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant we ate in Toronto. Great drinks and ambiance as well. Need to rsvp otherwise you'll be at the bar."}
{"text":"Food- Portions were small but everything was perfectly cooked with really unique flavours. The only complain was the lamb was a little dry. 

Restaurant- Fancy 

Service- Excellent!

Value- Pretty reasonable for good service and quality food."}
{"text":"Very accomadating as they allowed my group of three to eat at thw bar without a reservation. Extremely friendly bartender. 10/10 or 5/5 would totally go again next time i go to toronto."}
{"text":"Perfectly done Lebanese-Fusion:

Went for my wife's birthday, just the two of us.  What a lovely night.  Everything on the menu was well thought out and executed.  Very intelligent twists on everything, from cocktails through appetizers and mains ending in sweets.   A Lebanese Fusion meal I will remember, and not be able to replicate in my kitchen.  We will definitely go back on our next trip to T.O."}
{"text":"Upscale restaurant with simple food done in an elegant way. Great place for a girls night out, birthday dinners, or any kind of celebratory meal. Sharing style, so the more people the better! You get to try more dishes.

Been here twice now. On the most recent occasion, we ordered:

Cheese acharuli - this was really good. Tasted like pide
Roasted red beets - beets with yogurt and pistachios. I love beets so really enjoyed this. The bread it came with was a bit too salty for my liking.
Local roma salad - mountain of tomatoes with some feta cheese. I probably wouldn't order this again, as it's not that special.
Crispy squid - Pretty big plate of squid. Was very tasty.
Turkish manti dumplings - my friends really liked this one. For me, it didn't stand out too much.
Oxtail basmati rice - lacking a bit in flavour. Tasted better when we mixed the manti dumpling sauce into the rice. I've had the sweet jeweled rice here before too and recall not being a huge fan of that one. 

(Desserts)
Crispy qatayef - pretty much individual funnel cakes! Yum
Yogurt mousse - this one was really neat and well done in terms of flavour combinations.
Turkish coffee ice cream - this was actually dark chocolate ice cream. A bit misleading that the word chocolate isn't in the name of the ice cream because that's mostly what you taste. I could barely taste coffee. BUT as a chocolate ice cream, this was rich, creamy and delicious.
Burnt honey ice cream - compared to the chocolate (turkish coffee) ice cream, this one wasn't as creamy or flavourful. Definitely preferred the chocolate one.

All of this came out to about $30 each including tax and tip, for five people. 

The food here actually doesn't stand out to me too much. As in, I'm satisfied but not wowed (i.e. there's nothing I've tried here that makes me think, 'I must go back and eat this dish'). For a lot of the dishes here, I think it's possible to find similar dishes at other places for less price. But if you want a nice place to sit down, share and enjoy dishes that are well-presented and well-prepared, Byblos is a good place to go."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!! It was recommended to me by a random girl I spoke with on the train from the airport.  I'm so glad she told me and that I tried it.  Not really knowing what to order, the bartender and other patrons helped me decide.

The plates are not large but honestly it is plenty of food.  It is very flavorful and filling.  There are two floors to the restaurant, upstairs has the bar with full service so no reservation is required.  The bar tenders are very friendly and helpful.

I tried the Rose something cocktail, the octopus, the friend cauliflower, and the tai ding (spelling ??). All were amazing!!

Would've liked a little more of a mingly crowd at the bar but the food & drinks made up for it.  The bartender did a nice wine pairing with the meal.  You won't be dissatisfied here!!"}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like a modern day Persian princess in a Hollywood movie. The downstairs decor is gorgeous, the service is impeccable, and the dishes were beautifully plated. 
While there were some stand out dishes, there were also dishes that I didn't enjoy so much.
Namely the Turkish dumplings. The sauce was way too sweet to be eaten for a savory dinner course. 
Some stand out dishes: the desert course - Yogurt Mousse! It has amazing texture and it was just the right sweetness to finish off the meal.
My awesome friend came just before 6 to secure us a good spot! Arrive early to avoid waits."}
{"text":"This place is great. The waiter helped us order many plates to share and catered to all our palates. Everything we tried was amazing and a lot to please vegetarians. The wine list is extensive but on the pricey side. The whiskey list is amazing and reasonably priced. I love how they provide 3 oz drinks - but I definitely think mine was a light 3 oz.

The tables are a little low - so could be a problem for some people."}
{"text":"Had the most wonderful birthday meal here last Friday! Normally I'm not a big fan of Mediterranean food cause they are a bit too greasy for my taste. However, the food here completely changed my mind! Especially loved the sea bream and the sauce on the fish. The eggplant dumplings and lamb rack were super good too - especially the sauce. 

Our server was also very attentive and knowledgeable of the options in the restaurant. 

Would recommend for date and special occasions."}
{"text":"I really liked the figs that were incorporated into this dessert as the fig slices were so fresh and balanced the slight sweetness of the dessert. It was so delicious. This dessert, the lamb ribs, and the couscous with the Turkish dumplings were my favourite dishes of the night. We both don't recommend the Tuna Ceviche nor the Steak Tartare unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great food. Portion sizes are small for sharing but lots of vegetarian options. Our waitress brought some sass and had a lot of fun with our table. Can't remember her name but she was Greek and served us on the main floor. I could've ordered a few of the pide's for myself!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional and the food was out of this world. We had a group of 8 and orders a variety of dishes to share. We didn't order enough food. But what we did get was so good. The wedding rice and the ribs were so delicious and full of flavour."}
{"text":"Byblos's menu takes the patron on an adventure to the eastern Mediterranean; an area often underrepresented on the food scene. The divided menu of small plates and different samplings encourages sharing and experimentation. Try to choose an item or two from each section of the menu to diversify the experience. The house labneh with barbari bread was amazing, and the crispy duck confit rice was vibrant and flavorful. A must try for any lover of middle eastern and mediterranean cuisine looking to try something fun and inspiring!"}
{"text":"What a ridiculous concept. What a  ridiculously pompous place. First off, grown men, I mean men that don't live on Queen Street and work on movie sets, do not want to share their food. Speaking of which, the food itself wasn't that great either.  Our waiter, oh, I mean our 'food consultant'--had the humour and presence of a  mannequin. He referred to our meat dish as 'protein'...mmm...what a yummy and appetizing way to anticipate our main course!  My mouth was watering with the thought of our perfectly prepared protein...not!  Our consultant, deemed that 2 pounds of protein would suffice as a main course for 4 people but the only problem was, the lamb shoulder was about 1 1/2 pounds of meat and a 1/2  pound of fat--oh, I mean adipose tissue, since this place is very technical.  And such cute little condiment dishes on the side!  The different rice dishes were pointed out to us by a different server that came to our table.  As if any of us would know what kind of rice dish was which just by hearing the Middle Eastern names for them.  Not having spent much time in Lebanon or Afghanistan, we had no idea what this guy was listing to us. The best dish was the calamari--oh no, I mean the crispy squid.  One thing for sure, we could always have ordered more food, but the cheeseburger I had on the way home really hit the spot!  We just wished we had started there."}
{"text":"What amazing food! I really enjoyed it, so many unique tastes. The lamb rice dish was beautiful, the apps were great as well, deftly coming back 
Great service very friendly bartender - we walked in and sat at bar without resos
The drinks were nice but food was superb!"}
{"text":"I pretty much echo what most people here state, Byblos gave me one of the most complete dining experiences I've had in Toronto in a long time. The food was fantastic, service was friendly, drinks (I only had the gulab) was inspiring coming in a frosted steel goblet of sorts.

The main highlight here is of course the food! The menu sounds great and everything from the plating to all those flavour explosions lead all in my party to shower this place with constant compliments (except for the quiet times when we were enjoying the food of course!).

4 of us ordered around 7 dishes. If memory serves it was 2 large plates, rice and the small and mediums and we left full! My highlights were the cauliflower and baked fluke, but so many things sound like \"must try\"s!

We all ordered ice cream to end with which came topped with Turkish Cotton Candy which was heavenly. I completed the meal with a Turkish coffee too which I would recommend. 

I would not hesitate one bit to recommend this place for anyone, it's got a great location and food well worth the price!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin with Byblos because from start to finish, our experience was amazing. The atmosphere we great, we ended up at a wonderful corner table, perfect for a romantic dinner. 

And the food, oh the food. 

To begin with, it was a breath of fresh air to have a different style of food in a fine dining setting. They don't retread any of the current fine dining cliches here. Instead, the focus on Persian/Turkish influences provides a whole new palate with which to work. 

We ordered five different items from the varried menu, along with a dessert. That proved to be perfect for us, and they were coursed out at a leisurely pace. 

Among the highlights was the fig salad, which my wife says was one of the best salads she's had. Ever. And about which she is still talking. 

The lamb ribs were also top notch. They were fall-off-the-bone tender and had great flavor. The nut coating added a welcome, and novel texture. 

The rice we had, with fried shallots and yogurt, opened my eyes it's versatility and to the heights it can be taken in the hands of a skilled and creative chef. 

This is a restaurant that I'd recommend to friends, no questions asked. And it's one I'd happily return to next time I'm in Toronto--even if it means forsaking a visit to one of the many many other restaurants that the city has to offer."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, awesome food... bartender suggested a vegetarian dish and it was out of this world. Will go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic evening. I had a business dinner on a Wednesday evening - it was a party of three. We had made reservations 3 weeks in advance. The week that we wanted to go was all booked! This must tell you something positive about the restaurant. 

The service was professional and attentive, always refilling the wine glasses once it was low, explaining how much to order for three people and detailing the dishes.

We ordered: 

Manti dumplings (small, approximately 8 mini sized dumplings) - this was good. It was probably the least favorite from the whole meal but it doesn't mean it's bad. I am not a fan of sour and these dumplings had a slight tang to it. Still ate them though. Very soft and fresh.

Fish of the day - it was a red snapper. This was SUPER FRESH too, cooked perfectly and seasoned well. It has pickled cucumbers on it and some kind of green sauce - it was a hit. Couldn't get enough.

Tartufata Basmati Rice - complimented the fish well. Had truffle savings on top. It's simple yet complex at the same time. HIGHLY recommend. It was perfect serving size for 3 people.

Seared Califlower - I love cauliflower. I loved this dish. I probably ate the most of this dish. Tasted so buttery and seared to the perfect amount. Served hot. 

Wine - it was a cabernet sauvignon from Spain. I'm not a wine connoisseur so I can't describe it well. I wish I took the name down though because I'd definitely get this from LCBO. 

I plan to go back again some time!"}
{"text":"Byblos is a stylized and intently themed restaurant drawing inspiration from Eastern Mediterranean regions. The atmosphere has a Manhattan feel to it. I would highly recommend going with a few friends so that you could sample a variety of the dishes. The dishes are meant for sharing - tapas style. 

While the entire menu is delicious, I would recommend the following dishes which are not to be missed: roasted red beets, duck kibbeh, Spanish octopus, black cod, lamb rack and crispy duck confit rice.

The cocktails are also very good."}
{"text":"Byblos is without a doubt my favourite Toronto restaurant at them moment. We've been multiple times for special occasions and every time we are very satisfied. You can thank Charles Khabouth for yet another masterpiece. 

First of all, as a Maltese girl, I was shocked to see Maltese olives on the menu. Not often I get to enjoy the countries flavors in Canada.

I could list out all of our fave dishes but honestly, everything on the menu is amazing. After eating there a few times now, we've tried many items and all of them are exceptional. The dishes are so balanced and truly stand out from any other restaurant in the city. 

Prepare to indulge. It's worth every calorie."}
{"text":"Perfect meal!  Loved the decor, the service and the food.  Our server provided excellent recommendations and was the perfect host for the evening without being too much.  Loved everything."}
{"text":"Exquisite! If I could give this 20 stars, I would. I have eaten at many good restaurants, and this is the best in a while. We began with the fig salad, with pistachios and soft white cheese and greens. Our neighbors at the table on either side each asked, Wow, what is that? For the main course my mother had the fluke, which came in a creamy and buttery sauce; I am vegetarian and found many good choices on the menu and chose the Turkish manti dumplings with eggplant in a spicy sauce. Then how could we resist dessert? Mom chose an apricot ice cream, which arrived topped with a fluff of white cotton candy; and a Turkish coffee chocolate gelato, which was dark and wonderful. I had a Kanafi, a savory and sweet pastry of dense phyllo in cardamom syrup, topped with a licorice Arak ice cream and surrounded by flower petals. If I ever come back to this downtown again, I'm be back!"}
{"text":"Well well well, Byblos, I finally made it to you after all the raving reviews and the endless rejections I received when trying to make a reservation only to walk away semi disappointed. 

Came here before the glorious Phantom of the Opera and I'll start by saying our server was adorable; super friendly but why is it that when it comes to tapas they always tell you to order like 3638373 dishes when it's 2 people? We ordered 3...and couldn't even finish them. In 2016, I must work on my fatty skills vs my foodie skills apparently....

We started with the steak tartare which was definitely my fav out of everything - had a really nice spice to it. Next up was the roasted red beets which was my friend's fav and then we had the dumplings that EVERYONE posts....you automatically assume because everyone posts pictures of these that they're going to taste outrageous. I'm here to clarify; they did not. I can't be certain what that taste was but it wasn't worth the 25 minute wait it takes to prepare them. 

Oh, on another positive note - cab sauv - yum!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had.  Excellent, warm service, unique food, and a great decor.  I love that you can see the chefs making your meal.

Favs: Black truffle flatbread & the lobster special!"}
{"text":"It's really up to personal preference. I am not a big fun. Portion is too small. Fig salad is highly recommended. A little bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure but why but I like everything about this place. Great hosts, food is amazing and the smell of the place is very nostalgic for me. And the twists that they've made to the original recipes are admirable."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Toronto. The interior decoration is exotic and food is delicious and would never disappoint you. I love the lamb shoulder paired with saffron rice. Fig salad is also great!"}
{"text":"I came here for my parents anniversary dinner. I have mixed reviews about this place. The food was good, for the most part, but it was too expensive, it was too dimly lit, one of the waiters really didn't know anything about the food he was serving to us, and our waitress was pretty sneaky. One thing that bothered me was that the waitress would insist on getting us almonds as if they were complementary (we did not ask or want almonds) but would go ahead and add it to our bill. I know the goal is to up sell, but it would be better if she asked if we wanted an \"appetizer of almonds\" rather than insist on getting us almonds really quickly while we wait for the other food. 

What we ordered:
1. Sujuk bread: 9/0, this was amazing 
2. Fig salad: 10/10. My whole family loved this and my mom went on to make this salad at home. 
3. Sabzi rice : 4/10. I really didn't like this one. Maybe because this was a Persian style rice that I already eat at home and had high expectations for. 
4. crispy couscous: 5/10. The first bite was good but then it got TOO salty as we got to the centre of the couscous. Would not recommend at all.
5. Shoulder of Lamb (shawarma style): 8/10 this was really good
6. lamb rack: 7/10. This was ok
7. crispy quatayef: 7/10. This was ok"}
{"text":"Food was SO good! I also love the 'sharing' style! We had the lamb (amazing- best lamb i've ever had), brussel sprouts, fig salad among many other dishes and they were all delicious! Great location too in the downtown core, offering two totally different vibes - upstairs & downstairs! :)"}
{"text":"Recommend by a local friend and it was great 
Excellent food and service 
Split the lamb for two-great 
Excellent desert"}
{"text":"Lately its been hard for me to get excited about a meal, but I was really excited to go to Byblos and try out something different. I would recommend it for a special occasion or pre theatre dinner date. 

It was a little hard to find, but after entering thru the billowing black curtain, its as if you're in your own private dining world. Its two floors and set up more loungey than a formal dining area. I liked the atmosphere, but my biggest complaint is that the tables were low compared to normal seating height. By the end of the night our backs were a little sore. 

Music is loud in here. Its more clubby than atmospheric. I would love to bring my parents or in laws here, but they would complain its too loud despite the yummy food. Maybe thats not the clientle they are going for. 

The Food.

We got a bunch of small plates to share between the 2 of us. We started with the CRISPY EGGPLANT. It was deep fried eggplant sticks on tahini aioli. Really flavourful and more than just an eggplant tempura.Was my hubby's favourite dish.

Next was the DUCK KIBBEH. I found it a little dry, and I couldnt discern the duck flavour from it. Still good, but not amazing. 

My favourite was the LAMB RIBS, fall off the bone lamb ribs with a nut crust and molasses that made it crispy. 

We also got the ACHURLI which is like a turkish pizza. I've had a large version of this before, but this was still good with a brioche crust and quail egg on top. It was good, but small. 

As a side dish, had crispy couscous on top of collard greens and halloumi cheese. It was really simple, but it was good. 

TURKISH MANTI DUMPLINGS from the entree side, as our last dish. It was different and interesting, eggplant stuffed on top of yogurt and molasses. It has a sweet and spicy taste which I really liked. 

We were so full after this, but still had room for dessert, which they have a  lot of options. I couldnt decide between the Brik Pastry Cigars, or the Chocolate Mousse, so we got both (but could have done just one). 

Brik Pastry Cigars comes with 3. Phyllo pastry filled with Honey cream and figs, and topped with figs. It was good and better than my chocolate mousse, which was basically a cake topped with phyllo bits and shaved chocolate. it was decadent and chocolately but I like the Brik Pastry as something different. 

Really enjoyed the meal and service here. and would come back to try other dishes one day!"}
{"text":"One of my top favourite restaurants in Toronto, Byblos never fails to impress. With the extensive list of drinks, finely made cocktails (die-hard fan of the old fashion and I typically don't drink bourbon), and a wide variety of small/large plates to share, the menu makes each visit a unique experience.

For a party of 3, we ordered the steak tartare, shakshouka, mejadra basmatic rice and a side of brussel sprouts to share. All food items were properly seasoned with spices, and covered sauce and cheese. My favourite is the basmati rice which was finely balanced in texture and flavor with the fried shallots, that was nicely paired with yoghurt dressing. Total came to $42 per person which I thought was reasonable for King West restaurants with drinks as well. 

The service was great and I would give it 5+ stars if that was an option!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Amazing, unique flavors in sharing dishes and lovely quiet atmosphere in downtown TO. A real gem. Definitely get the Lamb ribs! Tuna cerviche was also noteworthy with squid ink chips. Had the daily fish - red snapper. It was prepared perfectly with a beautiful sauce with housemade pickle slices. The cocktail selection was equally fun, unique and tasty!"}
{"text":"Adorable place! Nice decor and cool vibe. Great cocktails and food. Didn't care for the octopus dish (entree was extremely small), but otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! So good! Every bite was heavenly. Great middle eastern fusion food. Servers are top quality. Our server design our order for us and it was exquisite. Highly recommend and I suggest you book before going there. The lamb is a must order. I recommend getting items to share."}
{"text":"Alright. I really really want to give Byblos a 5 but it wasn't perfect. Here's the run down.

1) It's not cheap but it's not expensive either... The house wine is a bit mean, $14 a glass... Really? Kinda a downer! My cranberry juice (I was counting calories) was $4, so that's alright.

2) Started with the fig salad. It was highly recommended by fellow reviewers. I mean it was good and the figs were fresh but it did not make me cry tears of joy or wish I could bathe in it. It was just a nice and fresh salad on a really colourful dish.

3) Lamb leg - OK. YOU NEED TO EAT THIS. warning, it can be very expensive as it is cost per weight so our 1.25 lb lamb leg was $55 but it could easily feed 3 people. They come with wraps and sauce and so much yumminess. And for once in my entire life, there were enough wraps for the meat. 

4) Persian rice - SKIP.It was cold and why Byblos lost a star. It was awful... It was also $24. I don't like to waste but it was left. Negative rating!

5) Cauliflower - it was a nice side dish. Again, came recommended but I'm totally biased as I lurve cauliflower. It wasn't as good as #6

6) Brussel sprouts and Halumi. Whatever kind of cheese Halumi is, I need to build a house with it and then eat the house... And probably die of overdosing on cheese but it would be glorious and so worth it. Beautiful dish. You won't be disappointed.

If I went back to Byblos, I'd order lamb, brussel sprouts and come back with a 5 star rating. Oh and Byblos is only open for dinner. 

Their decor is kinda strange... a mix of middle east meets random stuff one finds on the street and then fused it with other random things. And be careful, some of it isn't fused properly and can come off... Just saying..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day and our monthly anniversary. Well what can I say- we loved it! 

We ordered the The Geographer, Citrus Mixed Olives, Spanish Octopus, Short Rib Kebabs, Basturma Pide, Duck Confit Rice, Pistachio Ice Cream, and Orange Blossom Mousse. 

All of the food was amazing. However, I enjoyed the grilled Spanish octopus and short rib kebab the most. The short ribs were cooked to perfection- very tender and savoury. 

Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. She suggested the geographer cocktail which was a great suggestion. The cocktail had a nut-y taste to it with hints of sweet floral (if that makes sense). In addition, since our main dish (the rice and short rib) was taking a long time, the manager told us the dessert was on the house. 

Some fun perks include how they warm your jackets for you so as you leave the restaurant and they bring your coats they are nice and toasty. 

Overall what a great experience! 

Visited: February 11th 2018."}
{"text":"Great food. The fattoush is a must try. Was hoping for a little more lebanese food than a mix of various middle eastern. But the chef did a good job with creativity and all around taste. 
Nice ambiance and decor. 
A little pricey considering my mom cooks this stuff for free. 
But worth one visit."}
{"text":"Not getting the great reviews here. The food is just OK. Under seasoned (I felt like I was being put on a sodium restricted diet) and  not terribly flavourful.where was the mint  or cumin? The only predominant flavour seemed to be preserved lemon which is great but not terribly unique. Our group of four ordered about nine menu items and none were notable.  None. Not the tartar that was mushy and boring, not the rice that was overcooked and under flavoured and not the ribs that were fatty. On the bright side, the venue was pretty and lively and the service was pleasant. We were late with our reservation and they were kind enough to let us know when the table was being turned over which is much better than getting this information at the last minute as you are being rushed out. If you are looking for a pretty and high energy space but don't care about the quality of the food then you are good but if you want tasty middle eastern, I've had much better in strip malls."}
{"text":"Byblos was on my to-visit list for quite some time due to all praise it received. I came here for dinner on a Sunday night and was not disappointed. 

After browsing through the photos on Yelp, I wanted to try everything! Unfortunately, I had a heavy lunch and had to narrow down my selection to 5 dishes (for 2 people): 
- Lamb Ribs: delicious and not too \"gamey\" considering this is lamb, but I pretty much had to eat them with my hands so it was a bit messy 
- Wagyu Pide: the most delicious flatbread I've had! Not really sure about the wagyu label here but whatever, this pide was constructed very well and the consistency of the pita/bread was near perfect. 
- Spanish octopus: I was debating between the octopus and the turkish dumplings for quite some time before deciding on the octopus since I already had a lot of carbs. Although the octopus was well cooked (not chewy), there was nothing spectacular or particularly unique about this dish. Portion was also on the small side, especially since this was listed under \"large plates\".
- Black truffle rice: I looooove truffle and all things mushrooms so this was an excellent choice for me. The rice was topped off with a healthy portion of fried onions (or maybe they were shallots?) which added more texture to the dish. I would certainly order this again. 
- Seared cauliflower: 100% my favourite dish of the night. The cauliflower is smothered in duck fat and tahini sauce making it super soft and oh sooo tasty. Cauliflower have never tasted this good! 

Great atmosphere and service all around was quick and attentive. The servers must have topped off my water 6 times during my meal haha. I only wish I got to see upstairs too...I'll request that next time :)"}
{"text":"This place lived up to everything I heard. It's delicious. This is definitely a place you want to round up a few friends to go with so that you can split all the shared dishes and try as many different options as possible.
Go with an open mind and try everything. The only dish I wasn't completely sold on was the pizza/flat bread. Other than that I could eat endless amounts of everything else. The decor was also unique. Be sure to make a reservation in advance. I don't recall seeing them being able to accommodate any walk-ins."}
{"text":"I love this place. Then again I have a continuous affair w middle eastern elevated cuisine so I am very biased. This place though, combined the Persian delicacies with the Moroccan boldness and the Turkish creativity... Just amazing.
I can't wait to come back to Toronto, this place IS A MUST!!!"}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to try Byblos after struggling to secure a reservation on a weekend a number of times. Settled with a 6:30 pm slot on a Monday evening and although it was relatively busy, you could probably take your chances doing a walk-in on a weekday.

Contemporary decor but still had a very classy vibe. 

Lamb Ribs ($14) - These were delicious but tiny!! 3.5 small lamb ribs (the 4th one was more like a twig with barely any meat) that are tender, mildly flavored with a crispy texture. Not exactly the best value but taste-wise, 4/5  

Roasted Red Beets ($13) - I debated whether or not to order this dish pretty much until the very last minute when I decided to just take a leap of faith and trust my fellow Yelpers. So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5/5

Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5/5 

Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2/5

Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4/5

Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4/5

As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5/5  

Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  

A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to celebrate a special occasion or somewhere nice to go for a first date. Just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner when visiting from out of town.  Was not as impressed as many of the reviewers here, but that may be because the type of restaurant it is, just isn't my cup of tea.

It's more for groups that want to go out for specialty drinks and exotic light bites.  If you don't want to drink, and/or you don't enjoy sharing your food, skip this place.

Pros: 

The dumplings from the \"Large\" items section of the menu were wonderful.  As was the fried, cream-filled pastry dessert, with minced strawberries on top.  The servers certainly know a lot about the dishes they are serving and will spring at the chance to educate you on them.  The management was very accommodating to our party and sat us at another table that they felt would be more comfortable for everyone.

Cons:

Service was a bit TOO attentive.  A bit TOO familiar.  The waitress should not touch your husband on the shoulder, especially when you are sitting across from your spouse.  

The food was served too cold.  Anything fried, should always be served very hot.  Fried eggplant was lukewarm, as was the crispy squid.  The octopus is a bit too spicy and fruity.

Why they felt the need to dump a wagonload of parsley on the basmati rice is beyond me.  The rice on its own was pretty good!  

Also, it was drafty and cold over by the windows.  I had a cold blast of air coming up behind me through some crack in the wall that I could not exactly locate, throughout my entire meal.  By the end of dinner, I was chilled to the bone.

 
Would go back for drinks only."}
{"text":"Feel transported to the Middle East by Byblo's intimate ambiance and fusion cuisine with traditional flavors?. 
\"Our Basturma Pide Pizza was a tiny narrow boat, served on floral china. The cured meat had the texture of prosciutto and shakshouka spice added a zing of light spiciness in the pool of mozzarella - a flavourful and salty dish.\"

{"text":"Went to Byblos with my company for our holiday party this past week and had an amazing meal.

We had a prix fixe menu with a variety of dishes. We tried a ton of different items so really got a feel for the place. 

Biggest highlights for me were:
Duck kibbeh
Some sort of pizza-ish dish, I believe from a wood fire oven
Cornish hen - unbelievable flavour 
Blackened Cod wrapped in leaves - spectacular 
Cauliflower - equally spectacular... yes, the cauliflower was spectacular 
These mini donut-ish dessert bites

Cocktails were great as well. 

Not exactly sure or the prices for individual items, but I believe it's a fairly pricey spot. That being said, seemed like it would be worth every penny.

Atmosphere/ambience is beatific with great lighting and decor 

Would 100% dine here again in the future."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. The flatbread was divine, as was everything else we ordered - rice, lamb, dessert. Super creative with tons of flavor, without compromising the traditional flavors you would expect. Highly recommend. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Definitely an occasion restaurant. Their service doesn't disappoint, and all the food and drink items on the menu are delicious. Their prep station is also great entertainment - gives you lots of ideas on what to add!"}
{"text":"Very good Restaurant. Go with a group so you can share as many plates as possible and use your waiter as a resource to decide what to order they know their stuff. Had my birthday with five friends in April 2016 and then had a family gathering of 7 there in November 2016. Order the yoghurt and beet appetizer. Their yoghurt is homemade. The lamb dish was the highlight of our meal for foodies visiting from San Francisco. We pretty much ordered 80% of the menu and everything was flavourful, interesting and of good quality. There was an issue with the fish not being properly deboned but our server remedied the situation and went above and beyond. I think as the night goes on it becomes a younger crowd and noisier , I prefer going earlier and leaving before 9pm but that's me ;) also the desserts are OK but not as strong as strong as the food and cocktails. Will cost some $$$ but is worth it. This may be a trendy restaurant with good buzz but the fact is the food speaks for itself and having good service on top of that is a bonus."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and the food was incredible both times! The service was on point as well! I'll definitely be coming back again and again. The salads are so refreshing and tasty and try the cauliflower and beets! The restaurant itself is gorgeous and very fitting for intimate dinners."}
{"text":"Rather spectacular. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and the dishes were fabulous. Ambience was on point - loungy intimate vibe upstairs and more of a home kitchen feel downstairs. We had a few tapas size dishes like brussel sprouts with halloumi and baby artichokes with labneh. I need to go back."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Byblos is a solid restaurant with good food and a classy decor.

THE GOOD:
The food was interesting.  There was nothing bad and everything varied from good to very good.  

The Labneh was a good way to start the meal.  It was a nice mix of tart and sweet. The Crispy Eggplant was our second dish.  It was decent but do keep in mind that its deep fried. We then had the Lamb Ribs.  The four pieces were tender and delicious.  There's not much more to add.  

Before the mains, we had the fig salad which can be shared pretty easily between two people.

For our mains, we started with the Turkish Manti Dumplings.  It was the standout dish for me.  The dumplings are filled with a smokey eggplant and are covered in a really nice yogurt sauce.

As our final main, we had the Spanish Octopus.  It's not my favourite interpretation of Spanish Octopus (that would go to Patria) but it was all right.  There's around 5 morsels of fingerling potatoes with pieces of octopus on top, and a lone tentacle in the middle.

We had this accompanied with Seared Cauliflower.  I should have paid more attention to the fact that this has duck fat because in addition to tahini sauce because it was quite heavy.

I can't recall the name of the dessert but I had the baklava ice cream sandwich which comes with two sandwiches - perfect for sharing.

As for drinks, we had some cocktails which were all pretty good.  They're around $15 each.

THE BAD:
The service was OK. My water was infrequently refilled, and the food came out slowly. I asked for the menu at one point and it took about 10 minutes. 

THE UGLY:
We ordered some tea to accompany our dessert and it was served in glass cups.  Needless to say, I was tempted to drink it with a spoon.  However, the Moroccan Mint Tea that I had was pretty good, though it was a bit cold by the time I could finally hold it in my hands."}
{"text":"5 Stars for the food, 3 for the service. So, we'll just average that out. 

The food was phenomenal! I went having heard nothing about it yet, and was amazingly surprised. 

The standout of the night was the fried calamari. Hands down, it was the best version of that dish I've ever had anywhere. The squid was cooked perfectly and the gremolata was delicious. I'd also highly recommend the smoked eggplant dumplings. The flavour was so unique and I'll definitely order them again on my next visit.

Our waiter was never around when we needed him. After visiting for our drink order before we'd even been given menus, he failed to return until we flagged him down. At every stage we were trying to get his attention to clear plates or get new drinks. The restaurant could have easily upsold us an extra round of cocktails but instead left us with empty glasses through most of our evening. We were there in total for almost 3 hours - about twice as long as we should have took. 

Making up for the awful service from our waiter was the server who brought each course. He was so friendly and gave detailed descriptions of each of the dishes, it's clear he's passionate about food and what he does. If only our waiter had the same attention to detail!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious food and drinks. 

My only complaint is femla bartender (who ended up being our server) tried to push duck labneh as gluten-free which it is not. It is seriously unacceptable to bullshit when someone has a serious gluten intolerance. 

She seemed fairly passive aggressive with me while she flirted with my extremely handsome and sweet date. 

That being said, I am coming in tomorrow because the food is outstanding and the ambience is gorgeous."}
{"text":"I came here randomly with my fiance since it just started opening on Sundays (Finally!!). The first seating was at 4pm. Yay. We got there and the whole upstairs was empty. Usually this place has a full house and impossible to get evening dinner reservations. 
I was fully impressed with how pretty this place looked. The upstairs has a full evening/ lounge vibe with many round/ booth tables and a full bar. The downstairs part of the restaurant was more plain. 

Our waiter gave us excellent service. He told us that if we didn't come early, we wouldn't have had a table because they were fully booked for the evening. 
I'd totally come here in the evening when they have music / Dj and after happy hour mood. 

The food was delicious tapas. I loved all the small tapas dishes -- but i wish i had another tummy because I would have loved to try a lot more in one sitting and to share amongst more people. 

I don't think i'll order the tartare again because i didn't think it was that special. The other dishes that we had was the duck kebbeh (not dry like others say), fig salad (this was considered their main dish and it was not small like an appetizer --- it was delicious!!!) shakshouka
I forgot what the other dishes we ordered but dessert was AMAZING. i'm so glad we ordered it and by the waiter's recommendation (we asked what we should get if we're too full to eat). he suggested the mousse cake -- it was amazing!!! 

i'd come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but don't sit at the bar.   I came in early at 6:30 as the hostess suggested and the bartenders were swamped.  I had to flag someone down after my dinner went missing and 45 minutes after my appetizer. Also managed to get pelted with ice while the bartenders made drinks.  Disappointing.  For these prices the service should be better."}
{"text":"We were here last night with a group 12 for a birthday celebration. Due to the large group a pre fixe menu was arranged. We had the marinated olives, fig salad, roasted beets, lamb ribs, fried chicken, biriyani rice, rib eye, green beans and chocolate mousse and loukamides for dessert. Nice twist on Mediterranean cuisine and very flavorful. Rib eye was over salted. Lots of nuts in this menu for those who are conscious. We were seated upstairs and that has a different atmosphere than the downstairs space. It is a more cozy and intimate. Tried the echo cocktail and that was delicious. Wine selection spectacular. Server was knowledgeable about wine selection and attentive. Only problem watch out for the low hanging lights at your table when getting up. I hit my head twice fairly hard. Apparently this is a known issue here. Fix your lights! Overall unique and flavorful place for intimate dinner or gathering with group of friends looking to try a new place."}
{"text":"I saw how critically acclaimed this place was on Yelp and figured it was impossible to have a bad experience here.  

The food was amazing here.  Each dish was tasty and flavourful.  We ordered 4 dishes to share, as recommended by our waiter, but in hindsight, it was too much and 3 would've been better.  We got the Fig Salad, Lamb Ribs, Turkish Manti Dumplings, and Mejadra Rice.  The Lamb Ribs should be a mandatory dish that all patrons of the restaurant must order - my favourite of all 4 dishes.  The Fig Salad and Dumplings were great as well - very unique and yummy.  The rice was good as well, but it was too much and both of us are pretty carb-conscious people.

Byblos def. lived up to the hype. For the duration of the meal, I felt like I was living in an alternate universe as a pirate, pillaging an Eastern Mediterranean village for their magical tapas."}
{"text":"Our table ordered a few of the chefs recommendations and was very pleased with every dish. The service was amazing and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Byblos is an exceptional restaurant with incredible flavours, service and atmosphere. We ordered 7 dishes and all were incredible. The best part of the meal was the dessert. It was an intriguing mix of yogurt with pistachio cake and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Amazing food and great service. We went there 2 times within 1 week visit in Toronto. The best thing to order is the Pide (the one with truffle). Everything tasted good and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed the meal I had a Byblos last week, although the service was mediocre and turtle speed slow, I would still probably come back because the food was really good.

My favs: roasted red beets, Turkish Manti dumplings and the oxtail Basmati Rice. Interesting combination of flavours and spices and great presentations. The portions for the appetizers are small so you really need the rice to fill you up."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant.  Food is consistently excellent and service is great.  This is my new favourite restaurant in Toronto.  Love the fluke in Yogurt.  Lots of veggie choices too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We arrived for our 5:30 reservations - book ahead because 5:30 was all we could get. Got seated right away and ordered some drinks. 

The resto is tapas style, my favorite. They lose 1 star because they brought everything out all at once which makes it hard to enjoy each dish. 

Other than that, the food and service was incredible. Very unique flavour combinations. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A very great experience of modern upscale Mediterranean and Middle Eastern fare delivered with excellent service and atmosphere.

The atmosphere of the restaurant looks intimate but the style leans more towards family style dining which means everyone gets to try a variety of dishes. :-)  For a table of 2, they recommend between 4-6 dishes to get a full experience across their appetizers, mains, sides, and desserts.

The entrance to Byblos is easy to walk past as it is very non-descript but when you walk inside, the atmosphere lends itself to a very relaxing vibe with some eclectic design pieces.

The service staff is really friendly and very helpful about helping to point out the popular menu items.

The organic house labneh is solid and the provide a selection of different breads to accompany it.  We followed it up with the steak tartare which was a delight with the Middle Eastern flare of the labneh/chili/mint sauce.  It was a very satisfying dish.

The lamb ribs were the last mezze that we were expecting and they delivered in flavour (not too strong lamb flavour) and paired well with the buttermilk ranch and poppin' red chili sauce.

At this point I do have to say the pacing of the meal was fantastic and something I can appreciate.  We had a small table so it could only fit one to two dishes at any given time.

For mains, we settled for the Middle Eastern fried chicken and the spanish octopus along with a side of seared cauliflower.  I think the Middle Eastern fried chicken was the winner between the two.  it was crispy on the outside whilst the meat was juicy and tender on the inside.  The red schug hot sauce which had quite the kick was a perfect accompaniment to make you sweat a few drops from your forehead.  I was less impressed with the spanish octopus though, it felt a little tough in my opinion but it didn't stop me from enjoying the dish through and through.

Too stuffed for dessert but I had a wonderful experience at Byblos and would recommend it to those looking for a modern take on Middle Eastern and Mediterranean style dishes."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place and their take on Middle Eastern/Israeli food. 

Shared the following dishes with the young lady:

Lamb Ribs
Labneh 
Baked Fluke
Jeweled Rice
Turkish Dumplings

My favorites were the lamb ribs and labneh, perfection in taste and presentation. 

Our server was awesome. Not only did he go over the menu in full detail and provide recommendations, he also went out of his way to give us a list of some of his favorite bars in the area."}
{"text":"The menu is so unique and varied. Wonderfully prepared. Love the roasted beet. Great vibe. The dumplings are a must for dessert."}
{"text":"Girls night out this past Friday, all of us were incredibly impressed by the overall experience. Right on time for our reservation, the table wasn't quite ready so we headed upstairs to have a drink at the bar (no biggie)- all 3 of us tried Byblos take on the Bourbon Old Fashioned. Having had my fair share of Old Fashions, the drink was lovely, what was new for me was the bourbon on tap. Very cool. Once our table was ready we headed to lower level of the restaurant. We ordered the Baked Green Olives (if you're an olive lover like myself, you must order these), Roasted Red Beets, Guernsey Girl Cheese, Crispy Squid, Turkish Manti Dumplings (If you like spice- these were delicious), Mejadra Basmati Rice, and Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Just about everything we ordered we raved about. Will definitely be returning! Thanks Byblos!"}
{"text":"Slightly on the pricey side given the more casual dinning atmosphere. However, the food quality overall was excellent. The fig salad and the lamb ribs appetizer were some of the best dishes I've tasted... they were absolutely fantastic. The Mejadra rice and red beets were also very good. The slow braised lamb was recommended as their signature dish, but for $58, I didn't think it was quite worth the price. Still tasty, but after 14 hrs of slow braising, was expecting more. The Turkish Manti dumplings looked really nice, but tasted like a perrogie and wasn't that great. 

Service was fantastic and our waitress was attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu items. 

Would definitely like to come back and try some other menu items. Would highly recommend the fig salad and lamb ribs! Was so good!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so GOOD here! We always order fish and always satisfied with the taste and quality. Fig salad is my favourite salad and Turkish Manti Dumplings is amazingly delicious. Definitely order Qatayeh for dessert ;) can't wait to come back and have all of theses all over again."}
{"text":"Go Here!!! Loved this place, from the ambience to the decor to the waiters to the FOOD everything was perfect. Will definitely go back a new favourite. We had the labneh, lamb ribs, local Roma salad, mejadra rice and branzino. I would highly recommend all of these to share at your table, the food is way to good to not order a lot and share. Your taste buds will love you :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding, loved every dish.  Had the roasted beets, steak tartare, fig salad, black truffle bread, chargrilled cornish hen & roasted brussel sprouts and everything was experience.  Upscale Middle East flavours married with modern and European and American flavours.  The ingredients were the highest quality.

Atmosphere was also impressive as the restaurant's interior design made for great vibe upstairs and downstairs had different vibe more laid back but also very nice.  Ordered wine by the glass and it was very good.  So I would say this is a truly a 5 star review and perhaps my new favourite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very special food and nice and tasty. Excellent servuce. A plus for our waiter David: very good for the advise on our food selection and great customer service in general."}
{"text":"We were a large 15 person party for a birthday dinner. As usual, the food and ambience were exceptional. Our server Joel was outstanding. He was attentive to allergies, never let a glass go empty and did everything to make sure our night at Byblos was fantastic."}
{"text":"Extremely high prices for small portions.  There are barely any Lebanese dishes on the menu and I was not expecting this at all. Got some lamb which was served cold and blue. Although I like my meat rare or medium rare, this was pushing it. Flavour was good but the temperature was not. The waitress was friendly and service was ok, but everything else was not as expected unfortunately."}
{"text":"Amazing culinary experience. A Small downside about the music who could benefit a real research like equally to the menu."}
{"text":"I went on a weekday with some friends who had recommended this place. Upon entering the restaurant, the decor was nice and comfortable. The wait staff were very patient and helpful explaining the menu. Spring and sparkling water were provided complimentary to everyone.  However, we also chose a bottle of red wine to share.

We decided to share the dishes amongst the three of us and the portions were perfect for sharing.  To start, we had the Roasted Red Beets and Lamb Ribs,  Both were simple but surprisingly good.  Next, we were served with Turkish Manti Dumplings, Fig Salad, and Sweet Jeweled Basmati Rice.  The best was the rice dish as it had a good mix of ingredients that complemented each other.

Last, we ended the night with some dessert as we purposely saved room for Yogurt Mousse, Brik Pastry Cigar and Turkish Coffee Chocolate Sorbet.  The sorbet was not too sweet was delightful since it did not overpower the other desserts.  The best was the mouse which came with something similar to cotton candy.

It was a great night with good conversation and great food.  No room for improvement at this restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant while we are in town for trade show. Couldn't get a reservation, so we decided to try our luck. Boy, were we lucky. This is THE BEST dinner I have ever had in Toronto. 
Three of us ordered the lamb ribs, crispy baby artichoke, roasted lamb shoulder, grilled branzino and sweet jeweled rice. Every dish is exquisite and the flavors are on so many level. Definitely coming back to this one again."}
{"text":"The food tasted amazing and had great presentation. The bartender was extremely helpful with the menu and other local hot spots. They have a great wine and spirits menu. Definitely a must go."}
{"text":"Quite an exceptional dining experience. I'm not sure if I fell in love with the flavors at Byblos because they are not easily procured in modern upscale North American restaurants, or if because they are truly phenomenal within their own rights. I've come to the conclusion it's a little of both: the Lebanese/Moroccan/Turkish/Israeli niche is highly underplayed amongst trendy popular restaurants and the chef here is vastly more creative than the handful of other establishments attempting similar spins on Eastern Mediterranean.

We started with spiced marcona almonds and olives. The marcona spice was addicting: salty and a little tart. Peppery on the tongue. We ravaged these appetizers as we talked through the myriad of wonderful and exotic menu items. We went with the labneh, eggplant, steak tartare, Sujuk bread, falafel salad, Turkish Manti dumplings, lamb shoulder served shawarma style and jeweled rice.

Dear God, it was good.

Labneh was amazing - creamy, earthy with the perfect hint of honey. The barbari style bread was served straight from the oven - steaming hints of coriander and crisp Za'tar taunting our taste buds. I wanted to eat the coriander/Za'tar/sesame topping by the spoonful. The eggplant fritters in squash blossoms were impossibly airy and crunchy. Ephemeral with a hint of lemon yogurt sauce. I loved the flatbread Sujuk with its feta-type cheese and salty, spicy sausage. The falafel salad was good but didn't shine the way the other dishes did. 

The Turkish Manti dumplings: smoked and puréed eggplant carefully packaged in egg and flour dumplings, drizzled with molasses and garlic yogurt and baked until slightly crisp. Expletives are not enough to describe the perfection of this dish. Melt-in-your-mouth, perfect texture, a little smoky, slightly creamy, definitely tart, a little sweet. Don't miss them. The lamb shoulder was divine - tender enough to serve without a knife and delivered with flour pitas and accompaniments like pickles, yogurt, chilis etc. The portion was more than enough for 4 people. We also got the seared cauliflower cooked in duckfat. Man, Byblos, vegetables have never tasted so damn good! Speaking of which, the rice. The rice!!! The Basmati grains were the perfect texture of dry and moist - laden with marcona almonds, pomegranate seeds, raisins, blossoms, shaved carrot. Every sense was tantalized. 

With a bottle of moderately priced Grenache red wine, our meal came to about $150 Canadian per couple including tax and 20% tip. It was a wonderful, unique and very fun meal. Definitely going back. I need more Eastern Mediterranean food in my life. A great night."}
{"text":"Oooh, so elegant.  Great atmosphere and the drinks, and FOOD were amazing.  Lots of tapas-style options at this place, and the bartender fixed us up a tequila-infused off the menu option that was borderline overly lemony but ended up totally hitting the spot.  Can't entirely remember what we ordered, but everything we tasted was super fresh and unique.  Lots of great flavors soaked in, and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Stunning food - the slow roasted lamb shoulder is to die for. The food servers are excellent guides, if you are less familiar with Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Having traveled to Greece and Turkey, my husband and I are big Mediterranean food fans and this place met and exceeded expectations!  We walked in on a Friday night at 5:30pm without a reservation and had no problems getting a seat. We were a little apprehensive walking in at first because it is an upscale restaurant and we were underdressed and disheveled from sightseeing all day, but the staff was still very nice and courteous to seat us at the bar. 

The dishes we ordered were:

Lamb Ribs
Bread Salad
Chargrilled Catch of the Day (Whole New Zealand Red Snapper)
Oxtail Rice

Everything was delicious. You won't be disappointed ordering any of those dishes. We literally licked every dish clean, like a meticulous high-maintenance Persian cat grooming herself. 

Our only regret was not getting the homemade labneh. After our meal was over, we glanced over at other folks' tables and it appeared to be a popular dish."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's okay..very expensive, I didn't find the food to be out of this world. I think it's more about the scene than anything else."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mediterranean food and Byblos definitely lived up to expectations. The distinctive menu, flavourful spices and contemporary yet cozy decor created a great dinner experience. We started with the organic house labneh which was a tasty spread for the warm toasted house bread. We also ordered the crispy squid and fig salad to share which was devoured in minutes! The salad was fresh and the squid was not too oily and well seasoned.

For the main we ordered the slow braised Ontario lamb and the oxtail basmati rice. The lamb came in a very sizable portion (enough to be shared between 5 people) and was cooked perfectly and melt in your mouth. It comes with mini flatbreads and lots of pickled garnishes and sauces to build your own wraps. Highly recommend the oxtail rice as it was very fragrant with a generous amount of oxtail.

The service was also excellent and will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"LOVE BYBLOS!!! This is the best restaurant I've been to in Toronto and if I could give it 6 stars I would. Highly recommend!!

Everything we ate was amazing. We had the beets (mmMmMm!! seriously so good), fig salad, crispy couscous, delicious fluke fish baked in this amazing yogurt sauce, and the watermelon salad. It was sooOoOo tasty. The people I was with had the pulled lamb and loved it as well. For dessert the burnt honey ice cream and turkish coffee were divine. Also the cocktails were spectacular. Everything was amazing!! Just go!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was such a hot spot in the city!

The BF and I had spent the day at the Toronto Beer Festival and were looking for a bite to eat on the way home. I called in advance hoping to get a reservation. When I finally got someone on the line she said she didn't have anything for that evening but we could try to get a spot at the bar.

Luckily we arrived at the right time and found two stools at the bar. We ended up hanging out with the bartender for a couple of hours and it was a fun experience. He made me a bespoke cocktail with a bunch of cray liquors in it I have never heard of before and it was delicious. Bae got a delicious mojito type drank.

Ordered the lamb ribs, and yogurt with beets and honey to share (we weren't starving). Both dishes were very tasty! We ended up also ordering a chocolate mousse to share with two Turkish coffees, which was a nice way to end the night.

Overall, it was a great time and I would like to return to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Made an early reservation for 6.30pm on a Saturday for a birthday since it was the only time available until late night, the place was busy but wasnt packed with lots of room between tables to feel spacious. Service was very friendly and nice. We were sat upstairs, it was slightly dark but ambient, with lovely lighting fixtures and comfy seating. Great upscale middle eastern restaurant! We got 4 items and a dessert to share. 

Started with the House Labneh, tangy cool refreshing creamy and sweet with the honey with warm crunchy bread. Also got the Black Truffle pide, like an elongated pizza, it was warm and cheesy, good amount of toppings and truffle flavour. 

The Manti Dumplings were delish, the creamy sauce was excellent on the rice. It was savoury, sweet, smokey and creamy at the same time. Texture wise there wasnt much going on but the dumplings were soft, little pillows of yumminess. And lastly got the Sweet Jeweled rice, pilled with lots of crispy fried carrots. This was so good, the rice was flavoured with pops of sweetness from the pomegranate and berries and crunchiness of the nuts. 

For dessert, we got the Pizzelle, it came with 2 large disks of ice cream dipped in chocolate.  The price wasn't too bad considering we were full and had a little bit of leftover rice to take home. Can't wait to come back and try the other items!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Anniversary dinner at Byblos at Duncan St. The place is relatively small with narrow entrance. But the Food brings out all the magic. 

I had a cocktail named Gulab. Gulab means Red rose. The drink had rose-saffron seeds  sprinkled on the cocktail base and was served in a silver-bronze  traditional Indian cup. The Rice dishes were the best. The richness of nuts on top of rice bed is something you'll never forget. Lamb cops were great. The place is a fine dining restaurant in downtown Toronto therefore  you'll expect high class service, at higher price..... , for smaller portions. Lol

Overall it was a nice & cosy place. Great for couples. will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Perfection. There is nothing much to say. Fyred eggplant is another form of heaven."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal!  I was in Toronot recently visiting friends and family, and actually hit this place twice in a weekend.  The food is incredible.  While my folks were initially concerned it would be 'too noisy', it was actually a lovely dinner.  Not to be missed are the Fluke in yogurt sauce, and the dumplings...amazing.  We ordered very different food the two times I was there, and I can say that nothing disappointed.  Great food, fabulous service."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Not your classic middle eastern, but it's a creative mesh of upscale middle eastern food.  Best part is that vegetarian and meat dishes are equally good, so don't be afraid if you're veggie! Cocktails here were also very good if you want to go just for a drink."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents and had a great experience. My mother is the most particular and sensitive person so rarely has a positive experience at restaurants (she can tell right away if something is not fresh for example, and has a very sensitive palette). She had nothing but good things to say so that was definitely a testament to the quality of the food. Everything tasted amazing, and the server Rebecca was very helpful recommending dishes. My only complaint was that I didn't get to try everything on the menu!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were at the bar bc they were completely booked but it was perfect, romantic and just lovely (thanks to Laura the reservations manager for making it happen...we had to change our reservation a number of times because of major travel delays but they were very accommodating). 

The food and drinks were amazing...I'm writing this a month after the experience and I can't recall exactly but we had branzino, lamb, and veggie dishes that were excellent. They sent complimentary aperitifs since the kitchen 'burned' our rice dish and had to start over but honestly we were having such a good time, didn't even take notice. 

I do remember the baklava ice cream, yum, only wish I had had enough room for more than a tiny nibble. 

We had had lunch at Chabrol earlier in the day and the server there told us to ask for the 'grape witch' Krista. When we asked, Krista greeted us warmly and gave some great recommendations."}
{"text":"The drinks are good, the food's even better. The interior is lovely and the staff are very professional and informative. I have never had labneh before it was amazing. The dumplings were slightly underwhelming though, but still good! We ordered 4-5 dishes for 2 of us and we were super full by the end. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who's in the city."}
{"text":"The dining experience here is about as good as it gets. The restaurant has a slick, contemporary chic, yet warm atmosphere. It's a fairly large space with two floors but eating here always feels intimate. The service is phenomenal; the servers are extremely professional and helpful when it comes to choosing the right combination and order of plates for the table. Every dish I've had is full of deeply satisfying spice combinations and flavour--something that seems hard to come by these days. I highly recommend the zucchini flower kibbeh and the lamb, though you can't really go wrong with any of the options. It's also a great place for people with dietary restrictions. There are plenty of options for vegetarians and the lactose intolerant. Great drinks, too. Try to book your table at least a week in advance, especially for weekend reservations. This place is popular for good reason."}
{"text":"They deserve more than five stars.

My boyfriend and I ordered many small dishes to share (all their dishes even large ones are meant to be shared). Lamb ribs def lived up to the hype (5/5), Steak tartare (4.5/) loved Barbari bread and a hint of fresh mint in tartare. Turkish Manti dumplings (4.5/5) hmmm the sauce was incredibly creamy and flavorful. Seared cauliflower (5/5) warm tahini oozed out as I bit into a chunk of cauliflower. Black truffle pide (4.5/5) loved the combination of truffle and buffalo mozzarella. Hibiscus watermelon sorbet (5/5) OMG so refreshing and tasted like a watermelon concentrate. Yogurt mousse (4.5/5) YUM just yum 

Great service. Our waitress was very tentative and friendly, gave us good recommendations. 
Price: although portion sizes are small, def worth the money. 
Ambience: loved their decor and booth 

Overall, if you can have only one dinner in Toronto, go to Byblos. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had! The items are all shareable so it's a good idea to order multiple things for the table. I got the pide with the cured beef on top, fried chicken, duck-fat fries and lamb ribs. My recommendation: the lamb ribs that were falling off the bone! The service was excellent, attentive and fast without being overbearing. Definitely going back for seconds here!"}
{"text":"We've been trying to book Byblos for so so long & we finally got a table last night! Ambiance is great! Food was great! Great Service. Wine was great! I don't have any other words to describe my experience except that I will definitely go back & try the rest of their menu or the same dishes I ordered just because they're so flavourful. We ordered the red beets labneh,quail on rice, mussels with paprika couscous, grilled octopus and the Pavlova. All dishes were made to perfection!"}
{"text":"What makes a meal incredible in a fancy restaurant?  The ambiance, service or taste?  Our visit to Byblos made us think more about all these questions. We were a group of  four people criticizing how we ended up like unwanted customers after we left the restaurant in the middle of the night.  Then asking ourselves how a good meal can turn into a bad memory because of one server! Dinner was delicious but I don't have a possitive feedback about the service... Here is my review about the restaurant if you are interested...https://tasteswonderland.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/how-can-a-good-dinner-becomea-disaster/"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Amazing fresh fig salad. I could eat that salad all day and everyday. Wine selection was great. Service was super friendly."}
{"text":"I was here with one girlfriend. Lots of stuff here evolve around yogurt. Imagine replacing everything related to butter with yogurt. Every single dish we ordered had yogurt in it. My favorite is the petite lamb shank in the starter. Love the yogurt dessert as well. It's a fancy presentation of Mediterranean food, a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I came here for the media opening so I will mainly discuss drinks and atmosphere. 

I love the drinks here! They make an amazing whiskey fruit punch (which isn't on the menu but should be!) Petition for it foodies! ;) 
Their tea menu is sadly lacking though, last time I checked it was just generic brands not speciality teas. A missed opportunity I hope they correct because they have some awesome tea pots and cups I would love to try. 

The restaurant is actually 2 floors with the interior design a bit divided. The building is quite huge, with the main floor that has a more casual trendy vibe, the second floor for more upscale dining, and the third floor as event space for fashion shows, corporate/formal occasions, etc.

It's a great date spot or place to go with coworkers or friends."}
{"text":"Delicious food served tapas style. Perfect for a group to share. The decor is very hip and inviting. I strongly recommend reservations. There is limited bar seating but tapas is better enjoyed at a table for easy sharing. Plan ahead and make reservations. Byblos is very popular!"}
{"text":"Best of the best!! Amazing food and ambient.  The food is very well done with lots of flavours from the Middle East.. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"+ 2 Food was amazing. 

Lamb shoulder was huge (smallest 0.75 pound) and went well with side dishes (think of Korean side dishes but more subtle) and herb rice
Steak tartare was creative. However it was more like rare, potato-mashed style 
Roasted red beets was unusually yummy. I hate beets but it was so good.

+ 0.5 Price

2 people = $120 (tip + tax included). I was so full, almost needed a wheelchair. 

+ 1 Setting

Amazingly designed atmosphere

+ 1 Good service

Waiters were attentive but not obnoxious. Did not hassle even though we spent a long time in there

+0.5 Drinks

Huge selection of wine at good prices. However limited cocktails and beers. 

Take your SO here!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place after all the hype... and there were definitely stand out dishes! The portions are small and meant for sharing, so avg 2 dishes pp is fair. I wasn't big on the labneh but I loved the barbari bread that accompanied it! (Which was extra tho). I wasn't a fan of the lamb ribs as it was kinda fatty. The crispy duck confit rice and NY striploin were delicious! (See pictures)."}
{"text":"I was quite skeptical about this restaurant as I'm not a huge fan of Mediterranean/middle eastern food. After seeing countless positive reviews, I decided to give it a go, and I'm so glad I did! The dishes were in generous portions, and they tasted heavenly. We even ordered two plates of the eggplant/yogurt dish!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go to this police since forever, finally got a chance to go last weekend.

If i were to sum up this place in one word I'd say \"unique\".

Tips on reservation:
This place is extremely busy, if you want an easy reservation for a later date, you can use their website. However, if you want an earlier reservation, you will most likely be better off calling them (they have long wait times on the phone as well).

Service/Ambiance:
Impeccable, didn't leave anything to be desired. Our server went through the menu, knew the items on the menu very well, took plates as soon as we finished our meal and checked on us frequently.

Food:

Everything we have tried in this place (good or bad) had a very intense taste. I had a virgin Gulab drink and i would have to struggle to think if i have ever had a drink better than that, so many flavours in one drink perfectly blended together.

For appetizers we had Duck Kibbeh, Lamb Ribs and Sujuk Bread. Duck kibbeh was good for the first time. Lamb ribs were awesome! tender and seasoned uniquely. Sujuk bread was sooooo goood, crispy bread filled with cheese and za'tar and some other stuff that i don't know the name of, but know that it tasted good, would definitely order again.

The mains left a little to be desired, we ordered fried chicken, cornish hen and persian rice.
The fried chicken was not oily as you would imagine, and the sauce that came with it was very good as well. The cornish hen had an intense flavour as well, but one i didn't like as much, it was mixed with some sort of veggies which i didn't dig. The persian rice was very flavourful and unique.

It would have been better if they had a rice option with chicken/beef/lamb.

Overall, amazing experience would definitely go again and try their lamb shoulder which they are famous for."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday at 5pm. Made reservations on the Monday of that week, which I found out didn't seem necessary - it wasn't all that busy when we ate. 

Between 4 people we got:

Cauliflower - very good and definitely an excellent side. We ordered two of these and that was plenty. 

Beets - absolutely delicious and worth getting. Our waitress told us they come with 3 beers, so she was nice enough to get us a 4th one. Much appreciated. 

Lamb ribs - pretty good. Worth a try, however you're not missing out if you don't get them. 

Squid - amazing. I love calamari and these were delicious. 

Ontario lamb - absolutely delicious and a must try. The meat literally falls off the bone and come with these very thin tortillas to build mini shwarmas with toppings. The size was more than enough to give each us 4-5 tortillas each. 

Oxtail basmati rice - really enjoyed the kale they had on it and it complimented the Ontario lamb beautifully. 

The above dishes was more than enough to fill 4 adults and we were all stuffed by the end. We easily could have done without a few of the smaller dishes, but this was our first time and wanted to try various plates. 

The service itself was excellent and facilities were nice, clean and sleek. Total meal was around $230, including son alcoholic drinks. Definitely reasonable for downtown and the quality of food."}
{"text":"This is the best meal of the year I have had so far.

I went to Byblos for dinner with a friend on a warm Saturday evening in September. We didn't have reservations but called 20 minutes ahead to see if they could squeeze the two of us in. The hostess was friendly and suggested we try to get bar seating (we ultimately did) as it offered full dinner service. While I am generally not a fan of eating dinner at the bar, the seats were comfortable and soon after arriving, I was having a great time on my comfy bar stool.

The restaurant has a cool, NYC vibe. It is two floors and we were seated on the second floor (nicer scene upstairs...score!).

We started off with a glass of italian wine, a burgandy I think, but we were both more thrilled with the cocktail list. I ended up ordering off menu, and the bartender created a light and refreshing eggwhite gin fizz which I really liked. My friend was pretty wild about her cocktail too. Only downside was the price point. I think their cocktails start a bit on the higher end ($16)...don't quote me.

In terms of food, we stuck to vegetarian options as I am a new (and perhaps temporary) vegetarian. We started off with the Maltese Spice Olives ($7) Organic House Labneh ($10) and the Eggplant Kibbeh ($14).

We ordered one large rice dish (which you must, must do), the Sweet Jeweled Rice (carrot, saffron, barberries and almonds) for a cool $19. 

I loved EVERYTHING. I could eat the Labneh every day. It is so airy and light and flavourful. While I am usually careful about portion size, I think I went back for thirds of the rice. It was too good to leave and even then, we couldn't finish it all. The crockery that the dishes are served in and the plates themselves are super cool -- making Byblos a great place to take multiple iphone pics of every plate that comes out of the kitchen. 

This is a great place for an higher end date or if you need to impress a client or family or...anyone. All in I spent about $75 with tax and gratuity. 

I have heard through the grapevine that you can request a \"tasting\" which is more of an ad hoc sampling of the restaurant's more popular dishes. 

There are not many restaurants I would go back to but this is definitely one of them."}
{"text":"This is a really, really good restaurant that I am glad we stumbled into. The ambiance is incredible, though the small/intimate space does make for limited reservations and longer waits for seating. The food is exemplary and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu.

We did not have a reservation, so were seated at the bar (while putting our name on the table list). Even though tables were open, they were reserved for those with a reservation. Moral of the story, make a rezzie!! To my surprise, the bartender was extremely knowledgeable regarding every item on their intricate menu. I feel like most restaurants the bartender is more concerned about making drinks, but at Byblos the bartender basically functioned as any other waiter/waitress would. We ordered a few different options and a couple drinks to hold us over.

Negatives: Long wait times for food, and price. If you are looking for a restaurant with faster service, this is not the place. But, if you are looking for a good date spot, this is perfect. The food comes out spaced out so that you can savor each meal on its own without a gustatory overload. The food is INCREDIBLE. We ordered 4-5 dishes and each one had so many unique and harmonized flavors we were not disappointed. The downside to the great flavor is that we got increasingly impatient for the next dish. The night overall was great, as we savored each dish, enjoyed the great ambiance, and loved the food. Just come in with the mindset of having a leisurely meal. Oh, and we got moved to a table in the middle which was even better!

As I said, if you are not looking at price or time, this is an awesome place to try!!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing food in a modern environment. A thoroughly enjoyable meal every time. I highly recommend the Organic House Lebneh with Barbari Bread, Tah Dig, and Roasted Brussel Sprouts."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday and it was somewhat pricey for what it is. It wasn't easy to locate if you don't know the area. Need to turn into Duncan Street on King. Came here with 4 other girls and I wasn't really Wow'd with any of the food in terms of taste. I was only wow'd with the portions and price only. I guess it's because of the location, so they can charge prices at this rate.

The plating was nice but the portions was not anything shareable in terms of size. We ordered the side rice (that was the only big sized item), veggies were small and the black cod that cost $36 had 4 very small pieces wrapped in some sort of leaf. Oh I didn't mention that price was only for the cod. The veggies and rice was extra $$. Persian rice and Black Truffle rice add $24 EACH. So if one person would order \"one complete dish\" including meat/seafood, veggie and rice. It would be approximately $60 per without appetizer(s), dessert(s) and any alcohol. You can easily go over $100 without being full. We ended up paying around $450 for approximately 5 girl(s) not full with wine. We had to go to nearby Sweet Jesus to get ice cream so we would actually be full. I was hoping to be semi full even not 100% full. We were close to that but not quite there.

This is a place, I guess you can come with your date when pricing is not and issue. Just order away.

All in all, a place I may come back but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Totally a hidden gem - doesn't look like much from the outside but once you get inside the restaurant is quite quaint and charming. Instead of picking things off the menu ourselves, my group opted to let our waiter choose our options for us -- great idea!! Everything we had was fantastic. Will certainly recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food was nice but the atmosphere was way too loud and noisy. It's meant to be a restaurant and it tries to be somewhat upscale but it's really not focused on giving you a good dining experience. It feels more like you're in a bar. And the loud music doesn't even have anything to do with the \"Mediterranean\" type of vibe they're going for. 
For what you pay, it's really not that pleasant, I was so exhausted from the loudness of it that I didn't even want a dessert, just wanted to get out as soon as possible. 
Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go here for my birthday dinner :)  I love the cozy and quaint  feeling this place gives off.  It's a Mediterranean cuisine and I love how they have little touches of decor that reflect it, but it's not in your face.

We decided to try a few of the small plates and one large dish.  We had the steak tartare which was delicious.  The lamb ribs which had a lovely crust on the outside and were juicy on the inside.  These 2 dishes are a bit small to share but we wanted to experience a few things.

We also ordered the B.C mussels which were in this tomato broth with it appears to be Turkish pearl couscous.  Oh my - melt in your mouth, all kinds of delish!  The jeweled basmati rice was pure bliss.  In fact it was my favourite dish...the complex flavours just burst in your mouth

We did order 2 drinks, one was a rose/pomegranate type of drink - so lovely..but so little and it was $14.  It comes with a lot of ice so basically just a tiny bit of drink.

The dessert we had was Crispy Qatayef (Ashta Cream + Honey Syrup+ Sumac Muddled Strawberry).  So bright and light - perfect to finish off the evening. 

Certainly expect to drop some coin here...but it was my birthday and I deserved it :)"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST.

I've gone here multiple times since opening, returning with new friends who in turn come back with their own set of colleagues. 

The portions are small and costly, but you'll crave the flavors, and will sure enough be handing your coat to the lovely ladies at the front door a week later... 

Food:  
DELICIOUS.  I keep coming back for the Labneh.  The sweet honey with the tart cheese is addictive and a must have.  It's accompanied with fresh warm bread hinting at salty to excite an entire palate of flavors.

The Cheese Acharuli; GET IT. It's a bread boat of cheese and spices and is a safe treat for your picky eater friends. 

Grilled Cod; This is my favorite protein of the menu.  It's so soft and delicate, but catches you with a closing heat.  It's a must try, and will become a staple in your future visits.

Duck Kibbeh; Don't be shy in dousing the sauce it sits in, over it.  The homemade molasses is what dreams are made of. 

Steak Tartare & Turkish Dumplings: Meh. The dumplings had great flavor but tasted almost exactly like the crispy egglant.  Go with the eggplant dish instead and get your smokey and savory fix there.  The tartare was heavy with the bread, since a lot of the plates are served with bread.  A lighter and crispier carb would go better with it to break up the textures. 

Dessert:
Ice Cream: GET IT. GET IT ALL. We ordered multiple flavors, each person taking a liking to a specific bowl, concluding our plate sharing down to our favorites.  Each flavor was so potent and strong and multifaceted, it took your days of summer ice cream treats to a whole new adult level.   
The Toasted Honey was so unique and varied in it's flavor, it appealed to everyone at our table. The Rose-Blood Orange scared off many of the men who likened it to their mothers scented oils and potpourri.  To others, it was the best flavor of the night --closing off the rose and lavender cocktails had at the beginning of the evening.  
The dessert menu seems to keep changing.  I've had a few of the filo accompanied desserts, and been disappointed.  Stick with the ice cream. 

Service:
You don't realize what excellent service is, until you've been served here.  While some of the ingredients and preparation were spoken as if being memorized from a list off a cue card, the staff was still courteous and attentive to our wants and matching palates to the right cocktail/plate.  They're building relationships with the guests and making everyone at the table get excited about what they're eating.  It's a nice feeling when you hand over your dollars to someone you like, and was memorable, regardless of the quality of food.  
Booking the reso is cumbersome.  I think it's contracted to a 3rd party company, who seems to have a disconnect of what's going on."}
{"text":"Unique spot for any type of occasion - cool ambiance and amazing food - a little pricey though, but so worth it - here's some 'must try' dishes: 
-Brussels sprouts & halloumi
-Lam ribs with pomegranate dressing (apps) 
-Lamb tartar
-Jewel Rice
-Duck Kebbe
-Katayef for dessert

Very interesting variety of drinks - Gullab and Arak are exceptional!

Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I was hungry after work, and stopped in.  I ordered 2 dishes.  My first dish was tiny, and not inexpensive.  It was fine.  It took 1 hour to get my second dish.  It's not fun watching people who came after you eating all of their 4 dishes, while you wait for your second dish to arrive.  So stuff happens, but how does the restaurant respond?  Do they offer me any other food while I wait? Nope.  My dish is then brought to the table, except it's not my dish, it's my neighbours dish, and it is promptly whisked away and given to my neighbour.  Why should THEY wait?  With that tease of satiating my ever-growing hunger out of the way, I am made to wait more, and more, and more while I watch my neighbours on both sides chomping down.  I am offered wine.  It is not made clear whether it would be complimentary.  I don't feel like guessing and finding it on my bill later.  I had also informed my server earlier that I was not here to drink, but for the food.  I turn it down.  Nothing else is offered.  The server can see I'm annoyed as a lot of time has elapsed.  I receive apologies.  That does not remedy the situation or make me feel better.  Finally, the dish arrives.  It better be spectacular.  Overcooked!  I eat it because I am hungry, and I don't want to wait anymore.  Server asks me if food's good.  I say it's ok, with a pretty telling expression of disappointment.  It was ok, but at a place like this it should be better than that.  No follow up questions.   The dish was also small, and I am still hungry.  The server must have been aware of this as he recommended 3 dishes to be full, and I only took 2.  I ask for the bill after my last bite, a pretty telling sign from a dissatisfied customer.  Is there any remedy then?  A discount, a manager to discuss my experience and how to fix it, comping the dish (would have happened elsewhere without my asking)?  None of the above.  Full price, and an apology.  Talk is cheap.  Taking care of the customer and making him or her feel valued....priceless.  Almost all of my reviews on this site are positive.  I don't like to post negative reviews.  I'd rather vote with my feet.  Service is rarely my foremost concern, but when you tout yourself as a fine-dining establishment and the price is not cheap, the standards have to be better.  You cannot let a customer leave so visibly disappointed without at least trying, with actions, to make it better.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great ambience and very helpful staff! 

The manti - such perfect appetizer, highly recommended - truffle rice and fried chicken were delicious. Not a big fan of the cauliflower though, the oil and sauce were too strong flavours for me. Definitely going back to try more of their delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Front of house greeting, through fabulous cocktails, adventurous and delicious food, and incredibly personable servers, this is an excellent choice for a special occasion. Vegetarian dishes abound."}
{"text":"Jeez. 

It's a bit on the pricier side, but worth every penny (that we should probably be saving at this moment...). 
The restaurant is quite big with two floors of seating. The ambiance is kind of mysterious and dim lighted like you're going into a fortune tellers tent. The seats are really comfy and even though the restaurant gets packed, you can still properly hear the other person across the table without playing broken telephone. 

From our server, Joel's, recommendations, me and my friend got the following:

CRISPY EGGPLANT 12: amazing starter. It's deep fried eggplant pieces but not oily one bit. Has a bit of tomato paste and I believe sour cream and is just fantastic! 


TUNA CEVICHE 19: THE CHIPS. It's such a perfect mix of tuna, avocado, cream and chips that you can't believe something can taste this good. 


WHOLE BONELESS BRANZINO 42: Melts in your mouth pretty much and my favourite is its wrapped in softened vine leafs that bring out the taste of the fish itself. Definitely recommended 


YOGURT MOUSSE 11: I'm not much of a desserts person but this IS THE dessert to end any men. It's very light and sweet but doesn't linger on your teeth afterwards (or so it feels) . It's got like sweet angel hair candy floss top up which looks just divine and tastes even better. 

The service a was phenomenal. You were definitely looked after and your water we almost always stay full. Joel was such a pleasure to have and so well spoken! Our cocktails were taking a while to be made so he ended up giving us a vodka soda on the house which was so thoughtful!! You keep doing you Joel! 

Overall I would love to come here again and try everything else on the menu like it's my life duty to."}
{"text":"Five stars don't come easily in my world. Clayton Cooper (mixologist, bartender, and customer service expert) made this a reality! Byblos is in a touristy part of Toronto and conveniently located near the hotel where I was staying. I dined not one night but two nights in a row (which I never do) because of the experience Byblos's Clayton Cooper provided. The first night no tables were available so we sat at the bar, and the foodie gods sent us Clayton!  We chose the lamb ribs (a must) prepared sous vide style, homemade labneh with beets, and cauliflower prepared with duck fat. Each dish I would have ordered again but the second night was a dream, created by Clayton, who invited us back to the bar for an omakase style dinner. He choose the menu and pairings, and my party was able to enjoy the meal, his expertise, and our own company.

Byblos is fusion - in the best way - taking Lebanese and Mediterranean flavors to create memorable and surprising combinations. Watermelon and thinly cut/fried halumi cheese, bread salad with surprising pickled flavors and cheese, incredible salmon and steak tartar served with labneh (think homemade greek yogurt) dusted with sumac and microgreens... all a must! The star of the night was slow braised lamb (cooked for 14 hours) served with homemade lavash bread and an assortment of sauces -- and then to finish the housemade chocolate and honey ice cream, pomegranate granita, and then... (the dishes kept coming) a honey pancake filled with cheese and labneh fried and served with muddled strawberries.

I'll be thinking about this meal for a long time. For me, the prices were not just reasonable more like a steal! And for the owners of Byblos... Clayton suggested and reserved us a table at NOA steakhouse for our last meal in the city. Exceptional service combined with breathtaking food = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughter's birthday here.  Place was reasonable, menu contains a lot of lamb choices. We ended up sharing lamb for two. It was tasty, so were the small sis he's that came with it!"}
{"text":"My mouth still waters when I think of Byblos! Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto for both food and experience; I would recommend everyone to try it as many times as you can afford (~$100 for two). Byblos deserves a 5/5 for food, atmosphere, and service - and make sure you have a reservation or you'll be waiting for hours.

For two people, we split the Lamb Ribs, Black Truffle Pide (flatbread), Spanish Octopus, and Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous. I loved EVERY dish - the lamb slid right off the bone, every bite was dripping with flavour, the octopus had the right amount of bounce - the taste and presentation were impeccable. I cannot wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Great and interesting food, Excellent service.

Cocktails are nice, and well priced (compared to similar restaurants),
food was \"exotic\" and fun to eat. However some were just plain boring and could do without on the menu (like the fried eggplant). And some just needed a little tweeking (such as adding 1 more piece of bread with the  generous amount of yoghurt on the \"organic house labneh\" dish. 

I do wish they carried the Mediterranean theme throughout the restaurant from the decor and the music. Perhaps I'm just not that educated in design, but from my travel experiences, I did not feel a mediterranean vibe from the decor. Plates, and lamps were very pretty though.

Great experience, and would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me to Byblos for my birthday celebration! We loved our experience at Byblos and decided to revisit :) Service was excellent. Our server had great recommendations for popular items on the menu and was very friendly. The atmosphere is candlelit and dim, good for dates!

ORGANIC HOUSE LABNEH (5/5)
(Fennel + Honey + Olive Oil + Barbari Bread)
Tasted like a very yummy humus haha! It's soo delicious! The bread was covered with different types of sesame seeds so eating the bread itself was already very tasty. Adding the labneh was a plus! Loved it!

EGGPLANT KIBBEH (4/5)
(Zucchini Flower + Baharat + Chickpea Batter + House Yogurt)
I was super excited to try this crispy eggplant again but I realized they cooked it differently from how they did before. I'd prefer the crispy eggplant than this way of cooking. Both are still good.

WAGYU LAHMEH PIDE (5/5)
(House Turkish Paste + Fior De Latte + Toum + Basil Cress)
How can flat bread taste so good?! I'd order this again and again. The wagyu paste was delicious and the bread itself was very chewy. This dish wasn't dry at all because a lot of cheese was drenched on top of the bread. The smell makes you even more hungry.

GRILLED WHOLE BRANZINO (5/5)
(Chermoula + Saffron Toum + Watercress)
We came back for more of this!! I told my friends to order this dish at Byblos and all their reactions were like..\"Fish..?!\" Yes! Fish! They make it so good! The fish meat is drenched with flavour and the best part of this is.. It's boneless! 

DESSERTS:

LOUKOUMADES (5/5)
(Attiki Honey + Walnut Praline + Burnt Honey Ice Cream + Halva)
Tasted like chewy donuts dipped with honey glaze. It tastes really really good - especially the burnt honey ice cream! I suggest eating each of these little bits separately first. Each one has its own flavour. Once mixed together, it creates another type of texture!

PIZZELLE (3/5)
(Baklava Ice Cream + Salted Caramel + Cous Cous Praline)
The Baklava ice cream was amazinggg! The cous cous praline on top of the cookie was also delicious. The only thing lacking was the cookie itself. It was kind of soggy."}
{"text":"we went here after the Phantom and the place was amazing! everything we ate tasted very fresh and very flavorful. if you like middle eastern food, you will love this place"}
{"text":"Delicious and so many flavours! Best dishes were the fish wrapped in vine leaf and the fig salad. I didn't really like the turkish dumplings as much compared to the other dishes. Most dishes were quite fried (just a warning) but they were tasty. We also enjoyed the lamb ribs (smallish portion), Organic House Labneh, and oxtail rice."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Toronto. If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out! The food is phenomenal. I have been here twice and had a great experience both times.  My favorite dishes were the lamb ribs, chargrilled cornish hen (my favorite dish), roasted lamb shoulder for two and the crispy confit duck (rice dish). Cocktails are pricey but really good."}
{"text":"A unique spin to traditional Eastern Mediterranean food with a Canadian twist. 

The restaurant is urban chic.The main dining area is downstairs, but there's a second level as well. The kitchen is open concept so you can see the chefs prepare some of the food if you sit near that area. We came here as a group of 6 with much anticipation. We've heard tons of good things about this place.  Reservations are recommended because they are usually packed, even on a Monday evening. I have to say, this is definitely a place where you can catch up friends or have a business meeting without screaming across the table because the music isn't on full blast. The lighting is pretty dim. I did wish it could be a bit brighter so I could see the food with more detail. But, It's definitely first or second date worthy. 

The server was very informative. He advised us not to over order, which I found to be really amazing, especially since you would think they would encourage you to over order because it's money in their pockets. He was very honest! I like! Despite limiting the choices, we still had some leftovers. Our water and wine glasses were never empty and the servers were always around when we needed something. Attentive and informative - totally made the dining experience. 

The food came pretty quickly and was spaced out with small dishes first then large + sides. This is family style dining by the way. 

We ordered:

1. Duck Kibbeh: I found this to be kind of dry and a bit flavourless. I didn't taste the duck flavour. Unfortunately, my least favourite dish. C-

2.  Roasted Red Beets - Very tasty dish. I have to say, Byblos does an amazing job with their veggie dishes. They were all to die for and so delicious and let me tell you, I am an avid meat eater! The beets were cooked to perfection and the sauce it in was a good combo. A

3. Lamb Ribs: If you like lamb that doesn't have a strong gamey taste then this dish it for you. It's crispy and mild flavoring. I like things more with a punch so this dish didn't do it for me. Nice presentation though. B

4. Fig Salad: This was amazing! The figs were very fresh and sweet. The orange blossom vinaigrette and cheese give it a sweet yet savory taste. The pistachios gave a good crunch and  texture to the salad. A definite winner! A+

5. Dry Aged Ribeye -  Very tender, but I was expecting this to have a more Eastern Mediterranean flavour, but it tasted like a normal steak. I also don't recall tasting or having the smoked eggplant. B.

6. Slow Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder:  This was definitely one of the top dishes for me! The lamb was so juicy, flavourful, and tender. I loved the wraps that it came with for you to wrap the lamb and different condiments in. A first for me with lamb. The pickles, garlic paste, and lamb was a great combo! I could taste a lot of the eastern mediterranean flavouring. This was definitely a really unique dish to Byblos! A+

7. Mejadra rice- This wasn't very memorable in my head, but I know it wasn't bad. B.

8. Roasted Brussel Sprouts:  I love love this dish! It was so so so good. The brussel sprouts were cooked just right and the flavouring was amazing. This is definitely a stand out dish in my books. A+

9. Roasted Cauliflower: This was very good too! It isn't a unique dish, but it was cooked very well. A

10 Nightingale Sour: This cocktail was pretty good! It was a mix of sweet and sour. I really enjoyed it! B+

Overall, I would give the food a 3.0 because out of all the dishes we tried, only a few stood out, but I  have to say, if you want a fancy Mediterranean dinner, this is a good bet! But I would up it to 3.5 to 4 stars for the service!

Verdict: A must try, but come here with a group so you can try more variety of dishes. Order veggies dishes and the lamb. So good! I would come back and try veggie dishes!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding.  Family style dishes to share explore and discuss.  The flavours and texture were all fabulous.  The wine was a bit over priced as our 75$ bottle goes for 20$ at LCBO.
The service was personalized and impeccable. Our waiter had a great personality and was very informative about the food pairings and recommendations.  Amazing experience overall."}
{"text":"Great place that was a second choice that is easily my favorite in Toronto! Deliciously Fabulously wonderful!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection and quality of food for vegetarians! Appreciated the portion size and the attentive service."}
{"text":"Food was great! Ordered the lamb, couple of rice dishes, cauliflower sautéed in duck fat, daily fish.
Great design and atmosphere. Nothing we don't love."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful meal. We ordered the Slow Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder (1.5lbs) and it was scrumptious! You take it on a small thin pita and wrap it with pickles, turnip, chillies and garlic sauce. We also had the Sweet Jeweled Rice, which paired perfectly with the large plate. Everything is a shareable dish here and I'd also recommend adding on the Duck Kibbeh and Seared Cauliflower as sides."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner here! Highlights included the crispy eggplant, the slow braised lamb shoulder and the roasted Brussels sprouts! We'd come back if we lived in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully fragrant, flavourful, creative versions of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine.  The dishes are meant to be shared, so going with a few people will allow you to order a good cross section from the menu.  Coriander/cilantro lovers will enjoy the shakshouka and the seared cauliflower.  Friendly, unfussy service and great ambiance -- check out the row of lamps made of hookahs hanging over the bar!"}
{"text":"We went there for my father in law's birthday. The truffle boat shaped breads were to die for. So was the couscous dish. I was recommended the whole fish, which was okay, but not mindblowingly amazing. If I'm honest, a tad overcooked. 

Otherwise a great restaurant. Would love to go back."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The plates are really small so you should get a few. Our waiter was really nice. She said the Juices are freshly made but they did not taste fresh or food. Tasted like syrup. And from all of our dishes, the only really good dish was this meat and cheese on bread. Although it was really small, it tasted really good. The rice was okay. The juices weren't good. The lamb ribs were okay. The Turkish ravioli had a weird taste. Nice staff. Beautiful restaurant. Okay food. Pricey as well for food that isn't that good and in small plates."}
{"text":"Loved the Lamb Ribs - super fall-off-the-bone melt-in-your-mouth tender! Love the dukka spices (hazelnut, sesame seed), so fragrant, complimented by the sweetness of the molasses and yogurt. 

Also loved the Barbari Bread (more than the beets that it was served with), again with dukka crust, great on its own or with yogurt. Beets were halved rather than sliced, nested on yogurt and honey. 

Turkish Manti Dumplings - really loved the skin on these! Can't taste its mashed eggplant inside so even non-eggplant fans can try this one. I just thought there was too much molasses sauce, too sweet. 

Crispy Squid - (accidently ordered this thinking it was grilled octopus...) Like little strips of calamari, didn't really like this one, but I liked the aioli type sauce on top. 

Jewelled Basmati Rice - a long-grain, loose type of rice with pomegranate, crispy shredded carrots, saffron. Not bad (I actually found it more flavorful the next day as leftovers..)

Spanish Octopus - chewy bite size pieces.. I liked the spoon salsa! Refreshing with a hint of spice. 

For dessert I got the Burnt Honey Icecream - very sweet, very strong honey yet addicting! I like the honey crisp on top (sponge toffee), small portion and a melty texture for $3. 

Hibiscus rose tea very fragrant and soothing aroma, very sweet if you are into floral/fruity teas. 

Overall, enjoyed my first time trying Eastern Mediterranean food (Isreal, Morroco, Turkey) although ~$60 pp is quite expensive!!"}
{"text":"Best resto in the city! Every tastes spectacular. I would recommend that you try their rice dishes, the flat bread and a variety of meat dishes. Trust me anything you eat just melts in your mouth. Definitely pricey but worth the experience."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place in Toronto! Usually places where the food is this good, they become complacent about things like service and ambiance. Not Byblos! The décor is beautiful and service is excellent!! Plan in advance as it can be hard to get reservations."}
{"text":"One of our Top 3 restaurants in the entire GTA! We've been 5 or 6 times and this place never disappoints. Lots to choose from on the menu and some really unique dishes. If you're into Meat, then you must try their 'roasted lamb shoulder for two', it's simply the best. 

On our most recent trip we had the labneh to start (in fact we get this one every time we go), the chanterelle mushroom wood fired flatbread, Persian kale rice, black truffle rice and New Zealand Snapper (which was a special). 

We've simply never had a bad meal (or dish for that matter) at this restaurant. The atmosphere is upscale, dark and trendy, service is always great. Can't say enough good things about this restaurant. For us, Byblos is a staple and we'll visit every time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here with another couple when we all did a weekend trip to Toronto. It was great!

It is a shared plate style restaurant so we ordered a lot. We got the Organic House Labneh, Eggplant Kibbeh, Slow Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder, Mejadra Rice, and Seared Cauliflower. Everything was delicious! 

My favorite was the Mejadra Rice. Ever since we've returned, I've been trying to duplicate it unsuccessfully.

I thought the interior was beautiful and unique. My friend said \"it's like the inside of a genie bottle\" The service was excellent as well.

I definitely would recommend Byblos and would come back."}
{"text":"My family and I have loved coming here for a couple years now. The food is always cooked perfectly and the atmosphere is chill. The only downfall is it is sometimes difficult to read the menu at the dinner service, because the lighting is so dim."}
{"text":"Byblos has really good, authentic Mediterranean food. The rice dishes are really good, and the eggplant dishes as well. Overall, the food tasted great. The atmosphere was really nice as well. Our one server, however, wasn't very friendly. He always seemed to turn his nose up at us when bringing our food, and didn't take the time to be nice about explaining the dishes. The server who actually took our orders (and didn't bring the food), was really nice though."}
{"text":"The long and the short of it is that they serve good food, good service, but for a steep price.

It's a great place for a first date if you really want to impress someone. They serve one of a kind, instagrammable mixed drinks and their plates are quite pretty as well. 

Now for the food:

Almonds - they were nothing too special 

Olives - great!

Lamb Ribs - tender, sweet, and tad bit spicy! Yum yum yum (4/5)

Sujuk - akin to a pizza, but with more spices

Cornish Hen - DEEEEELICIOUS, the skin was like butter and the meat was moist but the star of the show were those leeks! (5/5)

Crispy Squid - the regular ol' calamari 

Dumplings - the yogurt sauce for this dish completely outshines the actual dumplings, but the dumplings themselves were also great (4/5)

Rice - Alright. Not great. (2/5)

Cauliflower - creamy and delicious! (4/5)

All in all it was a wonderful experience and the food was great. The eggplant starter and a few other dishes and drinks were unavailable today which was a bummer, but the rest of the food was still amazing! 

That being said, the price was also quite steep. The four us paid 50+ each for the above. Still, give this place a go!"}
{"text":"Middle Eastern dishes with a unique modern twist. Enjoyed all the dishes that we tried; Manti, Lamb Ribs, Wagyu Lahme Pide, Truffle rice and Short rib kebab. The background music could improve .. Something like a lounge music would be better than French Rap/hip hop music in a restaurant with a fully middle-eastern decoration. The type of music was something you would expect to hear in bars/restaurants towards queen west area rather than a more high end restaurant on King west. Other than music, everything else was great."}
{"text":"Where do I start?

Great service (by Canadian standards). The waiter even split our bill without asking, even though there was a mix of shared / non-shared items.

Food is mostly very good. The portions are on the small side. We tried
* Lamb Ribs appetizer -- taste good, but too fatty. Not a lot of meat.
* Manti Dumplings -- also good, but vegetarian. Do not forget to use the sauce. It is easy to miss that both ribs and manti come with a sauce, cause it is so dark inside.
* Truffle Pide -- tastes great. I am sure there is no truffle in it though, it is just a fancy name.
* Spanish Octopus -- very good! Melts in your mouth. 
* Fluke (fish) -- also very good.
* Sweet Jeweled rice -- awesome.
* Cauliflower and Brussels Sprouts -- great.

For dessert, I got Turkish Coffee ice-cream. It truly does taste like it was made with real coffee. I tried my friend's \"Turkish Coffee Bombe\", it was also very good.

It is a boring review, \"this is good, and that is good, blablabla\".

One bad thing: it is very dark inside, I prefer brighter places."}
{"text":"A gorgeous venue with a solid selection of strong fare and great service. If you're looking for a slightly more sophisticated place for a date, this is definitely a great choice, but the cocktails were a bit of a let down. For the price, you can do far better drinks wise elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Came here with family to celebrate a milestone. Had heard nothing but good things and decided to check it out. Don't let the outside and door man intimidate you, the people are nothing but inviting and hospitable. 

They had a great selection of cocktails and vermouth. 
We ordered eggplant, calamari, pide, and a few other sharing plates. Loved the flavour and the ambience. You can see the front kitchen making the tapas. Our host was amazing, she took the time to help suggest various dishes and had a great personality."}
{"text":"Such a cool spot.  Went with another couple and had a great time.

Why it's awesome:

1. they shelter you from the cold, think large blankets just inside the 
2. clever cocktails
3. lots of fun variety of foods + very filling
4. hip hop + r+b playing all night (maybe not expected, but welcomed)

stuff to try:

1. octopus
2. black cod
3. brussel sprouts
4. any cocktail
5. ice cream sandwiches + mousse cake

{"text":"Echoing others, Byblos is a place for a memorable dining experience. Really terrific food, sharp service, accommodating kitchen, interesting menu, great atmosphere. Lost a star for prices though."}
{"text":"Vibe/atmosphere: Not stuffy or pretentious. Interior design feels eastern Mediterranean, but in a way that's restrained and sophisticated. It's not a huge space so the chatter can reach pretty high volumes. 

Service: Prompt, attentive, courteous. Waiter wasn't super high on energy but he did his job well.

Onto the food (and drink): 

-Lamb ribs: Really appealing crunch, good spice level, perfectly tender underneath. 
-Eggplant kibbeh: That chickpea batter and yogurt sauce, though. One of the highlights of the night. 
-Organic house labaneh: Very fresh, creamy, with an interesting mix of the tart and sweet (from the honey). Barbari bread is loaded with garlic crumble and is maybe a bit on the stiff side, but still a good starch base for the labaneh. 
-Mejadra rice: Pretty good, wish there was more yogurt, though. Rice has a nice crunch to it but the flavors were somewhat muted. 
-Black cod: Really enjoyed the playful presentation of this. Toum and chermoula complement the smoky character of the cod. 
-Seared cauliflower: I think by the time I got to this I was ready to pop, so maybe that clouded my judgment. To me the flavor was a bit muddled and off-color. 
-The Aviator: Shared \"punch\" full of gin. More on the sweet side, but still a refreshing concoction.

Bill: I braced for impact and was still a little shook at the total. This is not a place to go if you want to be frugal. That being said, I don't think of any the mark up was way beyond reason. But just bear in mind...it adds up. 
 
Overall I quite enjoyed myself at Byblos. It's not a restaurant I'd go to often just due its price point, but for a once-in-a-great-while experience, my expectations were handily met. The food was prepared and presented with a lot of ingenuity and craftsmanship, and I left feeling like I made the right choice to splurge where I did."}
{"text":"Ate in the lower dining room, cool space.  A little crammed as we were pretty much in the table beside us conversation all night.

Started with the lamb ribs, marinated olives and calamari. Lamb ribs were insanely good, super crispy and flavourful. The calamari was also stand out, super tender and not rubbery like most. Olives were meh, it said oven baked and I imagined warm...they were cold.

For our second course we had the mussels. They were big and juicy and the sauce was spicy and delicious.  They added couscous to the dish which I've never seen done anywhere,  but I loved it. Ask for a side of bread to sap up the sauce.

We finished with the oxtail rice and grilled snapper. The fish took a while but we were warned. It was worth the wait. A full snapper, deboned perfectly and covered with herbs. It looks like it might be overpowering  (see photo) but it's very mild.

We couldn't finish the food and had it wrapped up for the next day. It held up well and the flavors were spot in when  reheated."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had New Years dinner at Byblos with another couple. This was truly the most exceptional set course dinner. The food was incredible and our server, I believe his name was Andrew, went above and beyond the entire night. I have several dietary restrictions and the kitchen staff, manager and Andrew were all incredibly attentive. To top it off, the desert spread was beautiful and delicious. We will certainly return to Byblos for dinner soon - and again next New Years!!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. the food is just beyond amazing and have really unique flavours. I especially loved the the roasted lamb shoulder and the persian kale. I couldn't find the dessert menu online to suggest some but all of them are perfect. make sure you try the desserts cause they taste heavenly."}
{"text":"We were a party of 3 on a Thursday at 6pm and seated on the 2nd level.  It was quite empty when we arrived, but the next booking would have been at 9pm.  By 7pm, almost all of the tables were taken.

Service was good and our waitress was excellent at her job.  She asked if it was our first time dining there and it was, so she talked about various dishes on the menu and the recommended portion for the 3 of us.  It is a tapas style restaurant.

We ordered:  Organic House Labneh (comes with Barbari Bread), Steak Tartare, Fig Salad, Turkish Manti Dumplings, Chargrilled Cornish Hen, Persian Rice and 2 cocktails.  Overall, we enjoyed all of the dishes.  My personal favourites were the Labneh and the Barbari Bread, Cornish Hen and Persian Rice.

Between the ambiance, service and decent pricing for what you're getting, I would recommend Byblos to my friends.  The manager/owner came by to ask how everything was and wasn't intrusive, so that was a nice touch. I will be returning to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"We made last minute reservations as we got into Toronto. The place is beautiful. Our waitress was the sweetest. The food is wonderful. We had the lamb ribs for appetizers, fatuoush salad, fried chicken (my fave), Turkish dumplings, rice with lentils, french fries, and olives. Very good picks!"}
{"text":"Very tasty place if you like a fine cousine from a middleeastern kitchen.
if you know middleeastern kitchens they serve a full plate on every order. The food is not only good but also plantyfull which that place was lacking. Felt somewhat dissapointed with the portions. Shakshuka was nice but shouldn't be priced that high, it's not a complicated dish and charging extra for extra bread is just silly stupid. 

Overall portions resemble appetizers for the price of a main course. The food is pretty good though"}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner, a place we would rank in Top 10 All-Time favorite restaurants.  We brought our four and six year old kids, who are fairly adventurous eaters and we all loved it! We started with the Labne, which is a yogurt-like dip served with fresh bread. The Sujuk, which is a flatbread with sausage and feta was delicious and also a favorite of the kids. The slow-braised lamb shoulder was delicious, you can make little \"tacos\" with the lavash and toppings provided (garlic yogurt, pickled beets, pickled cucumbers). While the lamb was a bit heavy, it was full of flavor and delicious. The Persian Rice, had a spicy kick to it (so kids did not love) but was very good with the shrimp and sausage flavors. Last, but not least the Roasted Brussel Sprouts were amazing, with flavors that you would never think to pair together with sprouts - halloumi cheese, tahini, and yogurt. Service was great, waitress had great recommendations and explanations of dishes. We have already decided that our next trip to Toronto will definitely include another visit to Byblos!"}
{"text":"As an Arab, I wasn't sure if I would this place would be up to par as the great restaurants we have back home but I was pleasantly surprised. 

The dishes are all tapas stype, which I absolutely love - you get to try everything! 
Everything we had was delicious, nothing was too heavy and had the right amount of spices. 

Ambience and decor of the place is great, as was the service. 

Will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"So unique. A menu only the most creative of minds could come up with. I visited with a friend for a girls night on a Thursday and we were met with an upscale, beautifully & tastefully decorated restaurant, wonderful service from start to finish (thanks to our server Erin for such great suggestions and attentiveness), and a remarkably one-of-a-kind, delicious, and unforgettable dinner experience. Hats off to the chef.

There are a number of options on the menu, so if you have difficulty figuring out what exactly to get (I wanted it allllll!), your server can guide you. NOTE: most plates are designed to share so don't be surprised with the smaller portion sizes (we realized it would have been better to visit with a bigger group so we got to try more items - definitely next time), and they also have a pretty decent sized drinks menu.

We ordered: a) Lamb Ribs ($14.00), b) Black Truffle Buffalo Mozarella Bread ($16.00), c) Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14.00), d) Middle Eastern Fried Chicken ($17.00), e) Hand Rolled Couscous ($8.00), f) Seared Cauliflower (tossed in duck fat and tahini sauce). The Lamb Ribs (so tender and full of flavour), Cauliflower and Dumplings were the standouts, but everything was so delicious with such a bold, generous mix of flavours, there was nothing we could complain about. These are dishes you won't find just anywhere, and everything was a pleasure to taste. 'Unique' and 'special' are the two words I can use to sum up our experience here. 

It's pricey for sure, but what an experience. This spot is located just east of Adelaide Street West and John Street. For all these items, plus two drinks (at $14.00 each), with tax and tip, our total was around $135."}
{"text":"I left it very last-minute in reserving a table for a birthday celebration.  It was very difficult to find a spot to accommodate a party of 6 at the more popular restaurants in town.   Fortunately, a table for 6 at Byblos came up.  I've only heard good things about this restaurant so I thought this would be a great opportunity to try it out.  First of all, the interior design was on point - modern with a rustic charm.  The service was good.  It got a bit loud at times making conversations a little more difficult, but again, it was a full house on a Friday night. 

The food exceeded my expectations. I personally really like Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food, and Byblos did not disappoint.  We started off with the Sabzi Qatayef (braised oxtail) and the house labneh dip. Both were small but tasty, just wished the portions were bigger. Then we had the black truffle pide, which was also small but absolutely delicious. For mains we had the Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, BC mussels, black cod, Roasted Lamb Shoulder for Two, Spanish octopus, triple-fried fries, Crispy Confit Duck rice, and Sweet Jeweled rice. Everything tasted great, but what got me the most was the sweet jeweled rice.  It definitely stood out from the rest of the dishes, and is highly recommended for anyone who is visiting for the first time.  

We had the Pavlova, pistachio ice cream/popsicle and the chocolate mousse for dessert.  The chocolate mousse was absolutely delicious! 

 It was definitely on the pricey end for the amount of food served.  We ordered almost half the menu to feed a group of 6.  The bill was definitely not cheap.  I would recommend this place for those who are looking for a place to celebrate a special event.  Would I come on a normal weekday dinner, probably not. But would I come for a birthday celebration, a definite yes. 

This dining experience was definitely a positive one, and it is likely that we will return for another meal in the near future."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with anything!!! Paid my first visit yesterday and it was exceed my expectation.... give it a try!"}
{"text":"Byblos is one of those restaurants you're always reading about but somehow you just never get around to visiting. But given that we had theater tickets one Friday night, the time was finally right to sample Byblos' much-ballyhooed wares.

We arrived at around 6:15 and we promptly shown to our reserved table near the front. Our very helpful waitress appeared shortly after and we began the slow process of figuring out just what to eat. We ultimately chose six items:

Duck Kibbeh (dried fig + date molasses + tahini): This was easily the highlight of the entire meal. I've eaten plenty of kibbeh over my lifetime but this is unquestionably the tastiest version of this venerable dish I've ever had. Everything was perfect, from the delectable spices to the unctuous, melt-in-your-mouth meat to the note-perfect sauce. Just astounding.

Spanish Octopus (fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemon): Although the octopus was cooked about as well as I've ever had it - the octopus at Bar Isabel, for example, was far chewier - there was nothing about this dish that really stood out. Perhaps it's because it came on the heels of the sublime Duck Kibbeh, but there was nothing here that really blew me away in terms of flavor - although the presentation was quite nice.

Sujuk Pide (turkish paste + persian feta + za'atar): I'm a big fan of sujuk (a spicy Middle Eastern sausage), so I was especially excited about this one. It's very good. All the components work extremely well together and the enveloping crust is baked perfectly. I suppose my one complaint is the sujuk itself, which, in addition to not tasting like any sujuk I've ever had, is completely lacking in the heat I've come to associate with the sausage.

Mejadra (lentil + hung yogurt + fried shallot): Again, this is something I've been eating my entire life and I have to say, unfortunately, that this dish just didn't measure up. Despite the aforementioned dollop of yogurt, the rice is just dry as heck. It's been cooked in a skillet, which allows the side and bottom rice to get crispy - an idea which sounds great in theory but doesn't really work here. Far more problematic is the fried shallot on top. Traditionally, the shallots (or onions) are taken beyond the point of caramelization, which lends the dish a rich flavor that's unfortunately completely absent here. This was definitely the biggest disappointment for me.

Seared Cauliflower (duck fat + tahini sauce + sesame + coriander): This is a very tasty side that's almost workmanlike in its execution. It's well done but it's nothing special, sadly.

Turkish Manti Dumplings (smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molasses): This incredibly rich dish admittedly goes well with the Mejadra, as it cuts that dryness I mentioned. But it might be just a little too rich; between the heavy yogurt sauce and the sweet molasses, it's impossible to taste the smokey eggplant supposedly contained within the dumplings.

All in all, I quite enjoyed my meal at Byblos. The ambiance is inviting, the service is flawless, and the food is, for the most part, quite above average. And I'd sure as heck go back just to eat that Duck Kibbeh again."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Byblos and both visits have been amazing. We tried the turkish manti dumplings, the roasted lamb shoulder for two, the fried chicken and the sweet jeweled rice. Everything was phenomenal, my boyfriend said the lamb was one of the best things he has ever eaten. The ambiance here is wonderful, as well as the tea cocktails that come served in a beautiful tea pot.  

Our server Rebecca was so attentive and personable, but she also seemed really down to earth and very professional - she is honestly one of the best servers I've had in Toronto. Everyone who brought over our dishes was equally kind and explained every dish to us. I really appreciate all of the little things that the service staff do throughout the meal to ensure that you are comfortable and enjoying yourself. Will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Fancier place than I'd usually go to but was lucky enough to meet up with some people there at the end of their meal (not really the sort of place where you are supposed to do that, but they were really nice about it) so tried a bit of whatever veggie things they'd ordered. Very yummy!! It seemed like it was tapas-style food, so ideal for groups - but the atmosphere is quiet and romantic, so it'd be good for a special date too."}
{"text":"Went for dinner before a show nearby. The environment is simple but beautiful, it would definitely impress guests or a date. The staff and service was excellent. They were knowledgeable about the menu items and very pleasant and attentive. 

The food is the best part of all. It's not your usual fare but if you are even slightly open minded you will like. We split the lamb shoulder which was delicious. We also had the saffron rice which was very good. Not only is the food delicious but also visually stunning.

We're looking forward to going back again when we have more time."}
{"text":"This wast the first time my bf and I trying mediterranean food. We ordered beets as going through the reviews on yelp. This dish was amazing, my bf does not like beets but he had to admit that the dish itself was very unique. They serve with bread as well and the sauce was very good. 
We then got Steak Tartare which was basically ground beef and greek yogurt, I thought it was ok but my bf really liked it. 
I also ordered lamb shoulder 0.75lb ($45) for both me and my bf. We were very surprised that instead of serving w bread, they brought out a selection of dippings and wraps.  This dish was definitely a signature one in our night, we were super full after this so we decided to skip desserts.  I also ordered a flavourful rice (forgot the name) as a side dish and it went super well with the lamb.
The pricing was not that bad for a fancy downtown restaurant like this. The total bill came up to $100 something including a cup of wine. The only down side is the seating, I feel like the tables are too closed together. But if you go as a group (3 ppl and up) u can choose to sit at the corner which is more quiet."}
{"text":"Food was great, love the ambiance and waiter was super nice, same as hostess.
Loved the place"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is awesome ! Looking for a spot for a birthday dinner this jumped out - I second guessed myself when we arrived and went through a rather ominous dark door which led to a set of stairs covered in a dark curtain - but then it opened to a pretty space and an amazing smell

The food consists of lots of smaller tapas style dishes, then mains and sides designed to share! We began with olives, tuna, artichoke , octopus which were simply amazing - perhaps the best I have had and amazing eggplant dumpling which was perhaps my favorite dish of the night

We tried the mussels as our main with the cauliflower, sprouts , couscous and fries - again all so good. Everything was full of flavor and potions just perfect !!

We ended with a couple of desserts by which point our bellies were popping but it was so worth it especially the orange blossom mousse!

Great vibe, service and the most delicious food !' So glad we made it here"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this place, but like other yelpers have written, it's really overhyped. In the end, the food's not really that memorable and the vibe was typical high-end King street-- loud, crowded, trying too hard, heavy on the blowhards, kinda sanitized. 

The roasted beets were quite special, for sure, but everything else we ordered-- the baked fluke, shakshouka, the olives, and the kibbeh were just kinda meh. Like I can do better at home. Maybe we ordered wrong, sure, but the service felt rushed and micromanaged and they didn't have the wine I wanted from the menu-- vibe things that, if I'm going to risk the ugh of the entertainment district for the promise of a great meal, make the experience a little extra disappointing."}
{"text":"Such a fun, delicious meal. I loved everything - the atmosphere, the food, the wine ... I enjoyed every minute. Try the labneh and Sajuk pide. All I can say is nom."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner because i loved it that much from the first time here. I came here with four other friends which is good as we were able to try and share a lot of the items on the menu.

We ordered 3 small plates, a salad, 3 large plates and 2 rice from the menu (for 5 of us).
 
SMALL PLATES  - lamb ribs, duck kibbeh and the crispy eggplant.  The lamb ribs were so good, crunchy outside but the meat were not dry at all ! 

SALAD- Guernsey girl cheese.  Watermelon and cheese might sound like a weird combination but it was actually surprisingly good.

LARGE PLATES - Turkish manti dumplings, B.C mussels and Spanish octopus. 
Rice -  Persian style fried rice and sweet jeweled. Both rice were tasty especially the persian style fried rice.  the taste was unique with a hint of indian style to it. 

DESSERT  - we pretty much ordered everything on the dessert menu.  the most memorable dessert was the Yogurt Mousse (pistachio dessert).  Also got a dessert with \"happy birthday\" on the plate as it was my birthday.

The service was only ok.  The food came out really slow, our dinner lasted 2.5 hrs!! The server did not really pay any attention to our table.  My water was infrequently filled throughout the night.  

Overall, this is a restaurant that i would recommend. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from the states, found this place on Yelp due to the great reviews.   They weren't wrong!!!   Staff got us in at the last second for dinner, friendly, welcoming.   The atmosphere was a mix of exotic sexy warm sophisticated.   The food was incredible!!!   We ordered several things to try, they were all fantastic but what I will crave most when I think back to this trip was the dumplings and the cauliflower.   Drinks and desserts were excellent, nothing bad to say, everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is great!

When we arrived, we were a little confused, since the entrance is fairly nondescript and leads you down a hallway with a dark curtain at the end of it. I almost thought we had found the service entrance, but the colorful dining room was indeed behind the curtain. 

When seated, our waitress was ready to take our order as if we were old pros, but we needed some guidance when it came to portions and pacing. She was very helpful in guiding us and explaining the menu. 

The food was excellent. I sometimes find flavors from this part of the world to be too similar to one another. I thought several courses of Middle Eastern food might run together, but they absolutely did not. Everything was delicious and distinct. We managed to get the last red snapper of the night, and I recommend that dish highly. 

Between the size of the menu, the quality of every dish, and the excellent cocktails, Byblos has something for everyone. Must-go."}
{"text":"Amazing Food......... Tried five dishes and they were all Fabius and unique!!!! Favorite appetizer Beets main Braised lamb or lamb rack.... If you have had lamb before and you like it then you haven't had it this good. 
Also amazing rice"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim because of the raging reviews I've heard about this place. Honestly, I didn't think we were going to get a seat without making reservations on a Friday night but we ended up being super lucky! 

What we ordered:
- fig salad
- crispy baby artichokes 
- lamb shoulder for two
- turkish dumplings 
- hand rolled couscous
- seared cauliflower 

We were told this was more like a tapas place and ordered way too much food for two people. The portions were way bigger than anticipated which I was pretty happy about. I have to say though, the food wasn't as mindblowing as I had hope and expected it to be. In fact, we actually sent back the Turkish dumplings because we felt like it was a bit overly burnt. I get that they were suppose to be a little charred but even the server stated they were more to the burnt side than usual. Nevertheless the service was top-notch. Our server tended to our needs with such a positive attitude and was so well informed of all the dishes there. 

If you're looking for a nice quiet dinner downtown, I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Toronto, and I stumbled upon this trendy little spot online. I decided to give it a try, and was surprised to find that without a reservation, there was a 45 minute wait! However, the bartender and assistant manager were amazingly kind and rearranged some reservations so that we could sit at a table. The service was incredible and all of the staff was polite and helpful. We ended up only waiting less than 20 minutes. Our waitress walked us through the entire menu, and as we had a vegetarian in our party, she was kind enough to point out tasty options for everyone at the table. We ordered a bunch of items to sample and they were served tapas style. My favorite dish was the eggplant kibbeh. We ordered a second plate of it!  I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful the staff at the restaurant was to make accommodations for us when we had no idea we needed a reservation, and it was worth every bite!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere for a date or special occasion. Great customer service. I'm used to a more traditional middle eastern cuisine- this is more what I would call a chef-inspired Mediterranean fusion. The calamari was so-so, the cauliflower with tahini was delicious, the beets and labneh were beautiful, lamb chops were spot on, the rice with herbs was perfect... The Turkish coffee was not what I would call Turkish coffee- it had no spice to it, but is was strong and I enjoyed it immensely. The Pizzelle for dessert was big enough to share and it was SOOOO good- we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I understand that there are hiccups when a restaurant first opens - but I have never felt so awkward or embarrassed at a restaurant before until I tried to have dinner here. The place was not busy, there were several tables free. My friend and I walked in after work, and were met by very kind (and eager) hostesses, who said they'll prepare a table for us. They took our coats, and told us to wait as they got the table ready. About 10 minutes of waiting later, the GM comes with the hostess, looks at the ipad, says 'no, no we can't give them any of the tables'. He then looks at us, says that they have capped their reservations, and unfortunately can't have us dine there. He gave my girlfriend his business card and told us to call him next time to make a reso (how is that any different than calling the restaurant?). The hostesses proceeded to awkwardly give us back our jackets, and we were set off. 

I cannot begin to explain how awkward and embarrassing the whole situation was - really left a bad taste in my mouth... most disappointing thing was that the food smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"Interesting place with lots of variety on the menu. On this first visit we had the lamb ribs, fig salad, manti, Brussels sprouts and truffle pide. All were great but the lamb ribs were the absolute highlight. They were sweet, salty, fall of the bones with a crunchy exterior. I could have easily went for another serving. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. I have been to many quality restaurants with my partner but never have we been put into a position such as the one we were in today. We would have given this restaurant a 5 star rating however, we were denied upstairs seating and were seated next to kids who were running around bumping our table. I don't have anything against kids but I feel there should be a separate section for families with small children. The food is exceptional but due to this experience I would probably not want to go on a date at this restaurant again. This is more of a family restaurant if you're seated downstairs. We didn't enjoy the experience the way we would have had we been seated upstairs. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for a date night for this reason. The whole point of date night is to sit and have a conversation free of loud kids. It's a chance to get away. And sitting where we did we certainly did not get that experience. Would recommend this as a family restaurant."}
{"text":"An extremely good and refined restaurant with Mediterranean flavors. Excellent service and food quality. It lost the fifth star with a price which is not really justified, and with a super expensive wine list."}
{"text":"Visited Byblos for a mini-vacation and it was absolutely the highlight of the trip! We had the citrus mixed olives to start, the truffle pide, sweet jeweled rice, roasted brussels sprouts, and hand rolled couscous. Out of these, the standouts were (in this order): sweet jeweled rice, truffle pide, and brussels sprouts. The flavor in all three of these dishes was truly extraordinary. The rice had multiple different textures and flavors that melded together perfectly. The truffle pide was deliciously rich and earthy. The brussels were roasted to perfection and the halloumi was a great counterpoint in terms of both flavor and texture. 

Pricey, but if you are able to afford it, I would highly, highly recommend Byblos!"}
{"text":"This place never fails. We first came here 3 years ago and every trip back has also been just as good as we remembered.

The first time we came here, we managed to get a table upstairs even though it was just for two people. We haven't been seated upstairs again. We've been told that it's only for large parties. It is quite posh upstairs. Don't get me wrong, downstairs is nice too, but I would still like to figure out how to get back up there without going out with a large group. 

We've come here quite often over the years, but after Yunaghi closed last year, this has been where we go for various celebratory reasons. We usually get two or three starers, two \"to share\" items, a rice, and several drink each. And if you think that sounds like a lot of food...yes, you are correct. We always think, why do we always order so much food? Why didn't we save room for dessert? The old Vietnamese saying 'Con mt to hn cái bng' explains this the best: our eyes grew bigger than our tummies. Everything on the menu became something we wanted, we'd order and not realize that we would have to eat it too.

The olives are always a good way to start here. We love the eggplant kibbeh with chickpea batter and yoghurt--the chickpea and yoghurt are so delicious. To share, we've tried pretty much all of the different fish dishes. My favorite remains the black cod. I noticed that a few reviews noted that theirs came out too dry, or overcooked, or the leaves were burnt. We've never had that problem though. The fish is wrapped, and so it remains tender and delicious. I love things wrapped in vine leaves. We usually also get black truffle rice, but the sweet jeweled is lovely as well. Oh yeah, I guess we also usually order a side of the roasted brussels sprouts as well. 1) Yes, I know...who eats brussels sprouts? Well, we do..we're not little kids and we happen to love brussels sprouts. 2) Yes, it does add more food to what is already a lot.

Everything is fragrant here and the spices hit all the right notes. The drinks only make it better. I always order the business man (never fails), however to be honest, I actually don't like it as much as any of the other drinks on the menu.  It just sounds like a really manly drink, and so I get it without remembering I don't like it. It usually means that the Mrs. finishes it for me while I get hers =)"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Great ambiance and make sure to try the crispy eggplant and eggplant Kebbeh! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Very good meditaranian restaurant. The price was good for a higher end restaurant. A quiet relaxing basement environment. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This place has great food with excellent flavours! The only reason it wasn't a 5-star was because the service was quite terrible and could've brought the score down more if it wasn't for the food.

Staff: We were informed by our server that it was a small plates style similar to Spanish tapas. Given that we were a party of five it made it an excellent chance for us to experience the dishes. However, we had tried to order the dishes based on the recommendation of a small for each of us (so five smalls), a rice dish, plus two larges. However each time we chose the dishes we were gently informed that the large dishes we chose were quite tiny so we should rethink our order and would walk away telling us to ponder with our own thoughts. This caused for confusion amongst us because we had changed it up 3 times before we had ordered enough food that the server felt was enough, which ended up being 4 smalls dishes, a rice dish, and 4 large dishes. I almost wish that they wouldn't have suggested otherwise in the first place and made us doubt ourselves multiple times. The food came at a reasonable pace, but everything always felt hindered by the service. At one point we asked for dessert menus and it took nearly 20 minutes and a second reminder before we got the menu. It seemed that they were well aware we wanted the menu but felt that they needed to (slowly!) clear the dishes before we're given the menu. This whole meal took 3 hours because of the service.

Ambience: It is a nice clean environment with comfortable seating. The place is dimly lit which was okay but as the sun was setting, it definitely got dimmer. It definitely had a Mediterranean feel when it came to the restaurant and the plates and utensils. It was nice seeing them prepare some of our food and drinks, as some of the prep is visible to the diners. Overall, great setting!

Food: To keep this from being longer than it already is, I'm just going to put in one line comments on each dish we ordered. Roasted Red Beets: nice yogurt, soft and juicy beets, excellent dish. Duck Kibbeh: I'm a huge fan now, with the great spices and flavours. Hamachi: I didn't care for it, but at least it tasted fresh. Lamb Ribs: a huge hit with everyone but I can't really comment since I didn't eat it. Chargrilled Cornish Hen: Excellent flavours, so juicy and causing my mouth to water just thinking about it again. Whole Boneless Branzino: It was okay, but nothing memorable to me in terms of flavour. Fried Chicken: I loved it, it was crispy and flavourful and reminded me of southern fried chicken. Yogurt Baked Fluke: I was most looking forward to this dish, but it relied heavily on the yogurt for flavour rather than the fluke. For dessert we had the Pavlova which I found was very tart for me, the Crispy Qatayef which had a strong floral aroma but tasty nonetheless, and the Loukoumades which was alright but the burnt honey ice cream was amazing!

I don't know if it was our server, but it seems like other reviews had a much better service than me, so maybe I'll come back soon, especially for the food."}
{"text":"Great decor and vibe with ample seating. Small, medium, and large dishes make for many possible combinations for different tastes, all working under a Turkish and Mediterranean inspired taste palette. 

Lamb Ribs is spectacular, meat falls right off the bones, charred just right on the outside. Fried eggplant, fig salad, and oxtail rice were all spot on and complimented each other well."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Dishes were served with style and the decor was elegant. A hidden gem indeed!"}
{"text":"Lovely dinner, great wine list and helpful, informative and attentive waitstaff. 
Beets with tahini and bread...so simple, so yummy.
Truffle rice...yum.
The fig salad, however, was my absolute favorite. So many amazing flavors: sweet, savory and aromatic...it touched on all my taste buds and I could have eaten bowls and bowls of it without any problem.
I also had the whole fish, which was simply done and good.
Brussels were tasty, too.
Lovely atmosphere, great dining experience."}
{"text":"This was the greatest culinary experience of the year for me and my lady. We live in Los Angeles, and came to Toronto for the 150th. We went to Byblos once and were floored. And we went there a second  time and were rocked yet again. For anyone who loves middle eastern food this restaurant flips the recipes on its side and reinvents the cuisine. The food is extraordinary, and if you are lucky get a seat at the bar and hope that Robin will be there to pair the drinks with the food. Serious foodies only!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience at Byblos. It's a classy spot, great selection of mediterranean dishes, tasty dishes, and top notch service (all for a hefty price tag).

Came here on a Sunday date night. I made reservations the night before online which worked smoothly. Our server was extremely professional, kind and attentive to our table. They re-filled our glasses promptly and explained the menu to us. 

Food overall hit the mark for me!

Crispy Squid 3.5/5 - Sort of basic in my opinion, nothing special and would not get again.

Eggplant 4.5/5 - I thought this was tasty, flavourful and cooked very well. The sauce fit well with it as well. 

Lamb Shoulder 5/5 - This was the main dish we got ($50 for 1lb). The lamb was super tender and flavourful. Comes with the condiments (pickles, garlic sauce, turnip etc...) and wraps which worked really well. (this was a bit too much for the two of us). 

Cauliflower = 5/5 - I really enjoyed this, crispy cauliflower with a yummy sauce on the side.

Overall, I'd come back and recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"I came here for a surprise bday dinner with my husband and it was delicious. The plates are beautiful and the ambiance is trendy. Loved the middle eastern vibe as well."}
{"text":"Mediterranean fusion with a mix of traditional and more modern dishes.  The courses are relatively small and made to share.  We had a local wine made from French Pinot noir grapes.  The Ontario terroir was not exactly great but interesting and complex nonetheless. The jasmine rice with duck confit went quickly and did the buttery branzino fish dish.  Fried beignets and honey pistachio ice cream were delightful."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for some time, especially because the ratings have been so high. Unfortunately I was extremely underwhelmed by my first time here. Yes, my expectations were high, but I am also very familiar with middle eastern flavours. I felt that the food was more experimental/fusion with flavours vs traditional flavours. Also, everything seemed way overpriced for what I was getting.

I had the lamb ribs, fried chicken, and truffle rice. The lamb ribs were coated with too many spices and slightly burnt, so I couldn't taste the meat at all, and the texture was rough and unpleasant. The rice was decent, but tasted more of Korean flavours, so I was thrown off. The fried chicken was good, but just like you'd get at any North American pub/restaurant.

All in all, I was disappointed as the food did not live up to the hype/price, though I really really wanted to like this place. If you are looking for more traditional flavours, there are many great places around that are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is one of the best restaurants I tried in Toronto. I never really tried eastern Mediterranean food aside from Greek food but I never tried food from Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, etc so this was really my first time trying this. Byblos primarily focuses on eastern Mediterranean cuisine but they add a Canadian/North American twist to it, which I find pretty cool. 

Finding this restaurant was definitely interesting. The entrance to the restaurant was an shelter with a small door made out of nylon, canvas, etc. It looked it I was about to enter a club. The restaurant is definitely beautiful. It is clear that they carefully planned out the design and decor of the restaurant. We went on a Monday night and the restaurant is jam packed. I didn't think a restaurant could possibly be full on a Monday night. This is a good sign. Though there were no available tables for our party of three, the hostess told us to just sit at the bar and the bar does serve whatever they have on the full menu. Since we really wanted to try this restaurant, we were down to sit at the bar. The bar is on the second floor (the restaurant has second floors). The bartender/waiter at the bar was really nice and provided great service (5/5 for service). 

Their menu is also really interesting. There's small dishes, large dishes, rice, sides, and salads. Apparently, in this type of cuisine, it's common to share dishes (similar to the cuisines in Asia). So we ordered: 

SMALL PLATES: 
Salmon Kibbeh Nayeh ($18) - Raw salmon, really good. The bread and the salmon paste just complements each other. 
Duck Kibbeh ($14) - This dish was okay, we barely tasted the duck and tasted mostly the molasses. Don't really recommend this one. 
Lamb Ribs ($14) - SO GOOD. Highly recommend this one. I have no words to describe this dish either. You'll just die of happiness. 
 
LARGE PLATES: 
Crispy Squid ($13) - This dish is so good, I cannot even have words to describe it. Really recommend this one. Hands down, the best crispy squid you would've eaten. 
Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - The yogurt sauce completes this dish. Really creamy and well made. I enjoyed this dish a lot.

The dishes are really small, so do expect to spend a lot if you really want to get full. Next time, I would order some rice to get full. 

We skipped on dessert because we didn't feel like spending any more money but I would definitely try the desserts next time. The desserts are really unique and they definitely have the primary staple dessert: baklava.

Our experience here was fantastic and the next time I will come here, I will remember to make a reservation!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 4 on a Wednesday night after work. We had reservations so getting a table wasn't an issue, but it did fill up pretty quickly.  Really nice decor, good vibe.
Had the Manti dumplings (amazing), Guernsey girl cheese (really good), duck kibbeh (good but i would get land ribs over these), lebneh (ok, it is what it is), fig salad ( really good), yogurt fluke (amazing), lamb's leg really good, a lot of food),  hand rolled could cous (so good), seared cauliflower, and oxtail basmati (so good).  This was a lot of food for the 4 of us but it was all really good. The Manti dumplings and fluke are must tries.  The lamb was huge so maybe ask your server about the portion size when ordering. I really loved the food here. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!!! The atmosphere alone is five stars,  it's downstairs and up.  (We sat upstairs at a corner booth for two..charming!)
We ordered seven plates between us, (we just wanted to try everything that sounded interesting to us but we would have been good with only four), and  all were complete stand-outs except the rolled couscous.  (Skip that one:  dry and bland, even with the toppings from other dished added)
But DO NOT following:

Eggplant/manti dumplings!!!!  OMG!!!
The fish baked in yogurt sauce is amazing!
The labne with honey and beets
The lamb ribs!

The cauliflower and the marcona almonds are both also very nice to have but the four above are originals here!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal at Byblos! I went with two other people and we ordered the following where I would pretty much recommended you try them all. 

Steak Tartare - Chili Paste + Mint + Yogurt + Olive Oil + Barbari Bread

Tuna Cerviche - Green Schug + House Buttermilk + Squid Ink Chip

Roasted Red Beets - Pistachio + Caraway + Labneh + Barbari Bread

Eggplant Kibbeh - Zucchini Flower + Chickpea Batter

Oxtail Basmati Rice - Kale + Black Trumpet Mushroom + Fried Shallots + House Yogurt

Dry Aged Ribeye - Za'atar Butter + Smoked Eggplant

Roasted Brussel Sprouts Halloumi + Tahini + Yogurt

Moroccan Mint (Green / Herbal Tea)
Featuring hand-rolled Organic Green Tea+ Organic Peppermint. This tea has been part of Moroccan heritage for thousands of years

I would highly recommend this place. Not only was the food delicious, but the service and the decor were top notch...

Also, my dinner companions had the following desserts and were quite pleased with them (I was too full to have another bite):

House Made Ice-Creams & Sorbets

Crispy Qatayef - Ashta Cream + Honey Syrup+ Sumac Muddled Strawberry

Kanafeh - Kataifi Filo + Spiced Ackawi Cheese+ Cardamon Syrup + Arak Ice Cream


Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The appetizers and small plates were amazing. Everyone at our table got really excited for the mains but they were a let down. The kebab and steak were just okay. The mussels were a little better than average. If I do come back, it will be for the dumplings and yogurt appetizers and drinks but not the mains."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here. Did not have a reservation, but called and they had bar spots open. Walked right in as a party of 2 

Robin and Albert were at the bar and they were both awesome. Great service and recommendations 

We had the house yogurt, the fig salad, the black truffle flatbread, and the fried chicken. All were excellent

Very happy we came here On a whim."}
{"text":"A wonderful tapas style Mediterranean oriented restaurant, Byblos is worth a visit. It seems that the next wave of tapas could emanate from the middle east and Byblos is leading this charge.  

Here were a few outstanding dishes (with ratings):

Roasted Red Beets (6/10)
Pistachio + Caraway + Labneh + Barbari Bread 

Cheese Acharuli (7/10)
Quail Egg + Brioche + Za'atar

Bread Salad (7/10)
Cacik Dressing + House Cheese + Tomato + Cucumber + Sumac

Shakshouka (7/10)
Spicy Tomato + Yogurt + Duck Egg + Romy Cheese 

B.C. Mussels (9/10)
Basturma + Maghreb Couscous + Saffron + Pilpelchuma 

Dry Aged Ribeye (9/10)
Za'atar Butter + Smoked Eggplant

Service was top notch, extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The restaurant has an in-house Sommelier that was humble, smart and engaging. He assisted our table at a few wine pairings, including some wonderful Oregon pinot noirs - fantastic! Not many Toronto restaurants have the St. Innocent pinot noir from Oregon, so it was a real treat. As always, if the wine requires decanting please request the decanting process table side.

Enjoy Toronto!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really elegant at this place especially at the top floor. Our server did a really good job explaining the dishes offered and also explained how the dishes are good for sharing. 

We were a group of four and we picked the lamb ribs and roasted red beets from the \"Small\" menu. The lamb ribs were really flavourful and fall-off-the-bone good. The lamb wasn't overpowering and the hazelnuts really gave it the nice crunch. The roasted red beets was their house \"cheese\" and it was really tasty with the bread that we asked for another round of the crispy fresh bread.

We also ordered the Turkish Manti Dumplings, Oxtail Basmati Rice and Roasted Brussel Sprouts Halloumi with Tahini and Yogurt from the \"Large\" menu. I thought that the creamy Turkish Manti Dumplings really went well with the Oxtail Basmati Rice which has a bold salty flavour to it. The Roasted Brussel Sprouts was crunchy and also a great addition to the rice.

They were also doing a Tapas Journey menu for a limited time - 3 tapas plus 1 Estrella Damm beer for $20 and you get a passport with stamp. Byblos tapas include lamb kofte, salmon kibbeh nayeh and fried olives. The fried olives were surprisingly good and stood out for me. That is not to say that the other two were bad (they were really good) but the fried olives were the highlight for me. They are all \"finger foods\" though so it might leave you wanting for more.

For the drink, I got the Gulab - virgin version which was really perfect with the savoury flavours of the dishes we ordered. Gulab is pomegranate juice with \"lemonade\" served with chunky ice crush. Really bright and punchy.

I was really excited about the dessert - we ordered Brik Pastry Cigar, Turkish Coffee Chocolate Sorbet and Yogurt Mousse. They were heavenly! The sorbet really had a strong dark chocolaty flavour with a hint of coffee. The pastry cigar with the figs was a real treat - I really like crunch and flavour of the cream. Finally, the yogurt mousse gave a hint of pistachios and also a \"flowery\" taste that is very unique. The \"cotton candy\" on top added another dimension to the mousse and it was a real treat. 

The dishes are on the pricier side however, it was worth the money (thank goodness!). 

If you are planning on going, go with a group and order dishes to share as the menu items are all unique and best to order more dishes that the whole group can enjoy. 

Our group really enjoyed our dinner at Byblos. We were seated at the lower floor but next time we'll get a seat in the more romantic setting upstairs (because I would definitely come back!)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely incredible. Everything we ordered was filled with flavor and amazing. Definitely make a reservation here, even on a random midweek evening. We did not and were stuck at the bar which was actually completely okay and much better than other bar experiences I've had. My favorite dish here were these small meat dumplings. They were absolutely amazing. The place is pricey but it's worth it. The dessert was a passion fruit mouse thing that was just melts in your mouth amazing. Service was impeccable here as well."}
{"text":"Wow I'm very surprised at all the positive reviews. Food took 2 hours! And then was cold! Save urself the wait time to even sit down an go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I've always heard amazing things about this place and decided to bring my man here for his bday! We were not disappointed and honestly, I was excited about the place because it offered something different as an upscale Mediterranean restaurant. My first thoughts walking into the restaurant was that the place was intimate, has a very nice ambiance and thumbs up for the open kitchen concept. In fact,I found myself getting distracted watching the chefs plating food. As a tapas place, they recommended 5 dishes for two people but we opted for 4. We tried the creamed spinach pide, turkish manti dumplings, truffle rice and the short rib kebab. All the dishes were exquisitely plated, flavourful but refined. Honestly, I loved all the dishes and would recommend them all. For dessert, we opted for the pavlova which was nice to end off the meal. The pavlova was served in a very interesting meringue ball which they had to crack open to reveal the equivalent of a strawberry shortcake. I loved the sorbet! 

Overall, I totally get the hype and would definitely come again. Service, food and atmosphere really speaks for itself."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved the food here when we ate here last week! The organic house labneh (delicious dip with fresh bread) is great as a starter! We also enjoyed the squid, turkish dumplings (heaven in a bowl I tell you!) and the kale and beans rice. We were really full after these 4 dishes. The turkish coffee was a good way to end the meal but wish we had room for dessert! About 3 dishes between 2 people are probably good enough if you want to leave room for dessert. We're definitely coming back here and highly recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful family-style meal. There are many gf options. Make sure to order the lamb. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, and I love their foray into dishes and flavours that you don't see much of in the city. Their concept of elevating Mediterranean cuisine is incredible in some of their dishes, very tasty in most of their dishes, and only missed in one or two items on the menu (which might not be your experience, so take it with a grain of salt).

That's what it comes down to though, I think, The flavours are so different that if you order half a dozen dishes (which I recommend) it's very likely that you'll hate one dish, really like two others, and want to marry the other three. And those love/hate relationships will differ from person to person.

That being said, I'd recommend the labneh, the manti dumplings and the octopus. Wasn't crazy about the olives. In the end though, you have to try the place for yourself. And when I say that you have to try it, I mean that you HAVE to try it. You will be missing out on a cornucopia of flavours and experiences if you don't, so make sure you try out Byblos at least once.

Oh, and the atmosphere is super cool. Great spot for bringing a date, especially if you have tickets at Roy Thomson afterwards ;)"}
{"text":"Love love love!  I eaten at Byblos twice now and it's fantastic!!!

I was skeptical the first time I was recommended to eat here, but was so pleasantly surprised!

You must get the lamb ribs, the rice with shallots, and the Fattoush (sp?) salad. Seriously the best salad I've ever had. It hits all the spots on the palette and has texture and is just perfect. 

This restaurant has reminded me how yogurt is so delicious in savoury dishes. 

Can't recommend enough!!!!!  Go!  You'll thank me later. 

And if you're not sure what to order, ask the server. They haven't disappointment me yet!"}
{"text":"Interesting interior, nice atmosphere and really delicious Middle Eastern meals served in smaller plates so you can share. They offer lot of vegetarian friendly meals - I would recommend labneh (yogurt cheese) & any of the desserts."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city! Expensive but worth it! Great for a date or dinner party - recommend the roasted red beet, the baby gem salad, the black truffle pizza and to drink the aviator tea punch!"}
{"text":"Service and quality of food was great.  Had the host and hostess choose the best dishes to eat. We were s party of 9 and the portions were perfect."}
{"text":"One of my favorite's in Toronto. Food is great and loved their other establishments, except FIGO."}
{"text":"To die for! The eggplant dumplings were some of the best dumplings and this comes from a carnivore. The lamb ribs were delicious. Had some kind of chili sauce and seeds gave it a crunchy texture. Bartender was great, both at conversation and mixing."}
{"text":"Great ambience and excellent service. We started off with the popular cocktail - Gulab (Rose). Delicious. A must try. 

We then proceeded to try the following:
- Organic House Labneh (excellent taste and texture)
- Duck Kibbeh (cooked well - crispy on the outside and fatty juicy minced duck on the inside)
- Steak tartare (this was good as well, however, not the best i've tried)
- Hamachi (there was a peculiar aftertaste to it ..... too fishy ..... had to return it)
- Sujuk Bread (good .... the flavors came through well)
- Black Truffle Bread (couldn't taste truffle at all ... not a hit with us)
- Turkish Manti Dumplings (really good ..... the molasses worked very well)
- Seared Cauliflower (wow .... just wow .... my favorite .... definitely a must try!)
- Thrice-cooked fries (regular fries ..... nothing great .... the Toum, though, was on point!)
- Roasted Brussel Sprouts (good texture and flavor .... worth trying, nothing that will make you go wow like the Seared Cauliflower though)

Highlights for the evening were the Gulab cocktail, Seared Cauliflower, Organic House Labneh and Turkish Manti Dumplings.

Great spot for an intimate evening. Byblos offers some delightful dishes that are definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the service was excellent.  The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star review is because we were seated at the bar (granted, we didn't have a reservation) while there were 7+ tables available the entire time we were there.

We opted for the chef recommendations and it was the perfect mix of dishes and the right amount of food to ensure we left satisfied.  

A few of my favorites,  although all amazing, were the organic house labneh, fig salad and lamb ribs. The seared cauliflower is an absolute must!!!"}
{"text":"Have been mainly doing brunch lately when meeting up with friends, so wanted to try a good spot for dinner. I've always been a fan of Mediterranean food and when I saw this restaurant come up on a few new restaurants lists, I decided to give it a try.

Came here with 2 coworkers on a Tuesday after work - the restaurant is tugged in just north of King West on Duncan street. We were greeted and taken to our table on the upper level - the bottom level had very interesting design and the bar there seemed like a good spot for a drink.

Since I got some good news that day, we decided to order a bottle of wine (celebratory drinks) - a chilled Spanish white (even though I'm usually a red wine person, white seems more fitting for summer and Mediterranean cuisine), which was quite light and refreshing. We ordered a few things to share - marcona almonds (not your regular almonds, the spices had a good kick), labneh (which had a hint of goat cheese which is not my favourite, but still enjoyable) that came with babari bread (had to ask for extra, for no charge) for dipping, manti eggplant dumplings (my favourite dish of the night - full of flavour, just the right ratio between a thin dough and juicy filling), yogurt baked fluke (we had to ask what this was - quite yummy, but the portion was a bit small), and finally the mejadra basmati rice (the yogurt topping complimented the flavour of the rice and the palate of the other dishes we ordered).

While overall the menu is on the pricier side, the service was excellent (wait staff very knowledgeable and attentive) and the decor/ambiance on point. I would recommend this for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"For my birthday I wanted to go somewhere nice with good food. I decided to go here on the day of after reading the good reviews. I wasn't disappointed. They were able to accommodate us last minute and it was the perfect ambience for a dinner for me and hubby.

We had the following: 

Crispy squid - it was a tad salty for my taste 
Eggplant kibbeh - very good crispy and unique it wasn't oily and the batter was just right
Lamb ribs- was a bit disappointed that there were only four pieces despite being expensive. It was good lamb and the texture was just right. Not enough meat
Mejadra- this was such a good dish and the lentils filled us the serving was enough for two and it went well as a side dish for protein
Yogurt mousse- this was like cotton candy on top of mousse and a soft pistachio cake. Unique dessert

Our waiter was attentive and accommodating. Like with other fancy restaurants the chef or chefs assistant mumbles and runs through the ingredients even though you can barely decipher a word they're saying. But I am still a fan because of the cuisine and the quality of food. Recommend for special occasion."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the overall experience is just ok.  I have been here a few times but never really stands out too much.
The last time we went we had a reservation for 6 and called before hand to see if they could accommodate one more person.  They said sure no problem.  When the group arrived there was only a table for 6 and when the 7th arrived they made it feel very awkward \"oh sorry we are really booked, let us see if we can make a spot\".
Then come meal time it is tapas style, so they tell you to tell them your tables top dishes and then they will calculate how many you need and bring it.  Makes it quite confusing.  I mean do you want to choose 12 things, then rank and then they just bring whatever they want?
Anyhow, the food was pretty delicious.  The cauliflower is a favorite of mine, and everyone at the table went crazy for the falafel salad.
The waitress seemed hard pressed to smile or interact much.  Maybe she was in a bad mood that day, I don't know.  Or maybe it's the \"we are too busy\" vibe they want to emanate.
Anyhow, it is probably easier to eat here with fewer people and don't expect a warm welcome."}
{"text":"I went here about a few weeks ago on a nice romantic date. This was one of the restaurants on my list to try out and I couldn't be more happy. I love the decor and the ambience. Every dish and it's presentation was very nice. Love the design of the plates that every dish was served on. The lamb ribs starter was amazing, meat fell off the bone and the flavor was delicious! We had the Turkish Manti dumplings, Persian style fried rice, organic house labneh served with awesome barbari bread and the daily chargrilled fish which happened to be a whole red snapper fish. All were very good. The whole experience was very lovely. We ended the night with desserts accompanied with Moroccan Mint tea and the traditional Turkish coffee. My stomach was full and satisfied! I have never been to the Eastern Mediterranean before but this experience felt like I got a glimpse of what it would be like and I would definitely come back again. Staff were all very friendly and I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys culture and the food really speaks for itself. =)"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my friends birthday but probably won't be coming back. The food was good but the prices are very high and the portions are extremely small. We also arrived when the place was almost empty but they did not let us choose the table. Overall it's a good place to come for cocktails - they are delicious, and some light snacks. But if you are hungry and don't want to spend too much money, go somewhere else. We ended up sharing few dishes, having a drink and then heading to another restaurant for \"real meal\"."}
{"text":"I grew up on Turkish food so I was looking forward to coming here. 
I was resistant at my first bite because it is not traditional but more of a fusion between middle eastern and new-age/weird contemporary. 
But the chef really pulls it off with the simplicity of the ingredients yet it's high quality. 
We had Kebobs , basterma pide, pilaf, and lamb shoulder.
Very tasty, unique and despite the small dishes very filling. 
Finished with hazelnut mousse and Turkish coffee. 
I could never take my older relatives here, because they would deem it blasphemous, but the experience did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great location, in the heart of the financial district , located upstairs on the second floor of an old building. The restaurant has a cool feel and a fantastic bar to sit at.  The bartender was really friendly and ordered all of her favorite dishes for me to try.  The rice dish (sweet jewel) with the nuts and berries was unbelievable, as well as the goat and cows milk cheese.  I'll be back for sure on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow. Just. Wow. If you want to try something truly distinctive in downtown Toronto, you've got to come here. The cocktail menu isn't posted on their website, so make sure you check it out and try something before your meal. This is a great date spot or late-night dinner destination.

Also - I never thought I'd get excited about rice, but the \"Sweet Jewelled\" rice with carrot, saffron, barberries and almonds is superb and I don't think I'll ever look at rice quite the same way from now on. That said, there wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like here. Everything is fresh, fragrant, and spiced to perfection."}
{"text":"So this was a major disappointment! I was really looking forward to our dinner however as soon as I mentioned I was gluten free, the attitude of our waiter changed and the service became super minimal while the tables around were getting normal and friendly service. 

The food was delicious but nothing fancy. I've had equally great food at much lower prices and definitely without the attitude. 

The decor is funky and fun. 

If the service had been friendly, I am sure our experience would have been much better. I had heard of the snooty attitude of some restaurants in Toronto but this was totally uncalled for. 

I would not go back."}
{"text":"I love this place and have become a regular. 


MY MUST HAVES:
1. Organic House Labneh 
2. Shakshouka 
3. Lamb Ribs
4. Turkish Manti Dumplings
5. Seared Cauliflower

Food & Service are both 5 stars.

(My first time here, I tried a rice dish that I though was quite dry. I told my server this and he gave us two dishes complimentary)."}
{"text":"This place is the mother of all Mediterranean restaurants!  Decor, menu and service are all up there and the plates are absolutely out of this world Delicious! I seriously wish they would open in Montreal as I'm ready to drive out to Toronto again just to eat here.  It's pretty much all I crave now."}
{"text":"3.5/5

*The overall service was wonderful and attentive, except toward the end my server sorta disappeared somewhere else. 

*To sum things up, there were two dishes that were quite underwhelming but the others that we love were just incredible with unique flavors. Since it was only two of us for dinner and most dishes at Byblos were tapas, we weren't able to cover most of the menu. Thus despite my low rating of Byblos, I'm willing to come back to give it another chance and try other offerings on their menu.

-Organic House Labneh (fennel, honey, olive oil, Barbari Bread) - $10
The barbari bread arrived piping hot and crispy, and it was quite salty to eat on its own. However the bread itself paired perfectly with the sweet honey and tangy yogurt in the labneh. The labneh was silky and smooth, a bit peppery and had a lovely cooling sensation.

-Lamb Ribs (Dukkah, Buttermilk Sauce, Carob Molasses, Red Chili Schug) - $14
The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and had great flavor. A bit spicy but it was balanced by the sweet buttermilk sauce. The thick crunchy layer coating of dukkah added a nice texture and helped to mask the overtly mutton-like flavor.

-Steak Tartare (Roasted Red Chili, Mint, Labneh, Barbari Bread) - $18
The texture was just melt-in-your-mouth goodness and beyond buttery. With that said, the red chilies overpowered the delicate flavor of the beef and there wasn't enough labneh to balance out the spicy notes.

-Tuna Ceviche (Green Schug, Crème Fraiche Buttermilk, Squid Ink Chip) - $17
The squid ink chips were slightly salted and had the perfect bite sizes. Both Karen and I didn't like the texture of tuna as it was quite \"hard\" to chew. I also thought there wasn't enough lime to bring out the freshness of dish, and the avocado didn't really work well with the tuna either.

-Turkish Manti Dumplings (Smokey Eggplant, Yogurt Sauce, Molasses) - $14
The Turkish Manti Dumpling had an addictive thyme based yogurt sauce and the molasses gave them a touch of sweetness. The dumplings were perfect cooked with a thin shell and filled with eggplant. I didn't mind that you can't really taste the eggplant. I always hated the taste and texture of it, thus I was surprised to see how well they were able to \"mask\" the eggplant taste with not too much smokiness.

-Hand rolled couscous (Brown Butter, Saffron, Herbs) - $6
On the initial bite, the couscous tasted a bit bland but it was really fluffy! The herbs and saffron flavors didn't come through, however I thought the couscous was perfectly paired with the yogurt sauce from the manti dumplings.

-Pavlova (Rose Pastry Cream, Pomegranate Molasses, Fig, Pashmak) - $12
Not too sweet. I thought the outer shell of the Pavlova was a bit hard to crack, otherwise the inner layers were soft and creamy. It reminded me of what I would imagine a baked marshmallow to taste like. I liked how the rose fragrance was not too overpowering and the slight tangy-ness from the fig helped to balance out the sweetness of the pavlova. Unlike normal cotton candy, the pashmak had a wool-like texture, almost like Asian pork floss and it just melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"I usually keep an eye on any new restaurant openings in the city and this one definitely caught my attention.
It pays tribute to the flavors of Eastern Mediterranean encompassing Turkey, Israel, Greece. It is located in the basement of the iconic STORYS building. The decor exudes Middle Eastern vibe with authentic vases on the shelves. 

The cocktail craft is taken very seriously here. We had a couple of cocktails and were very impressed with the unique flavors they infused into the drinks. 

Across the Sea Moroccan Mint Tea-Infused Captain Morgan Light Rum, Fresh Lemon, Sugar, House Middle East Bitters, Ginger Beer - seriously? Mint-tea infused rum, bring it on!!

Gulab Rose Infused Vodka, House Pomegranate Reduction, Lemon, Tincture of Cardamom - You can definitely get the distinct cardamom tincture in this aromatic drink.

The menu is meant to be shared although the portions are not huge. 

We tried a few dishes from the small plates (tapas) section of the menu. The roasted beets with lebneh was melt in your mouth delicious. They serve it with fresh wood fired oven baked barbari bread which was worthy standout on its own. We also had the duck kibbeh which was moist from the inside but after a few bites I wished there was more sauce to dip into. Another irresistible dish we tried was the Cheese Acharuli with Quail Egg, Brioche, Za'atar spice - Absolutely delectable!!!

The seared cauliflower with sesame was probably the least favorite side dish of the night. It wasn't bad just that my palate prefers the charred cauliflower flavor than the lightly seared cauliflower that was served with a creamy sauce. The main course we had was the arctic char with a spicy sauce.

They say save the best for the last and Byblos hit a home run on this. We had the yogurt mousse with pistachio cake - so unique in taste and very light and airy in texture. 

The service was very polite and friendly. They pretty much checked on every dish and ensured that it appealed to our taste buds. The manager was kind enough to offer us a complimentary dessert of salted caramel like chocolate mousse. 

What a great addition to the downtown core !! This is totally my kind of place with the ambience and creative food and I will definitely go back to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! A great modern take on middle eastern cuisine. Me and my girlfriends came here for Christmas dinner last night and to my surprise that had a great selection of vegetarian dishes. We ordered a wide variety of dishes and indulged. Nothing was left on the table! 
I can't wait to go back and take my parents, they would enjoy the twist on our traditional cuisine. 
Oh and aside from the food, service was A+ and added to our great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Went for my birthday and we were a group of 8 so had to get a set dinner. Family style. So tasty. I loved the capon fish and the rice. 

Drinks are super tasty. The only thing I think could be better is the music. We sat upstairs and it's really loud, drowns our the conversation."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dinners I've had in Toronto. 
The food was so great and the ambiance was just as good.

I wouldn't say that their dishes were particularly \"Mediterranean\", but everything I tried consisted of Mediterranean flavours. For me, this was a really nice experience because each dish had it's own spin on ingredients you'd often find in Mediterranean food. 
I had the cornish hen and left the restaurant waddling. The portion was very good, and I was absolutely stuffed. 

Though this place is on the pricey side, I highly recommend this for nights you feel like splurging. This is the perfect restaurant for a romantic night out!"}
{"text":"visited byblos for my mom's birthday last night. rebecca was our waitress - she was humble, professional, honest, and looked proud to serve such delicious food. the lamb, duck, and brussels sprouts were standouts, but everything was delicious - the cocktails as well. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The falafel salad was absolutely delicious. I would also highly recommend the Yogurt Mousse! It is brilliant!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try out this place after discovering it on Yelp and seeing all their photos on instagram.

I got The Geographer (gin, of course) and it was very tasty.

We then got the octopus, lamb ribs, and some duck dish, along with some rice. Every dish had its own uniqueness to it, whether it's the meat-veggie combo, or the spices and flavours of the dish. Every first bite was almost like a surprise, and eating here was a whole lot of fun. 

The wait time for each dish was reasonable. Everything is meant to be shared so it felt like I was constantly eating! The portions were all on the smaller end and if you are a big eater, watch out for your wallet!!

One thing I also liked about the place was the interior decor."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This was so lovely. Such lovely environment. Love the decor and the service was wonderful with such a great menu 

Go with lots of people so you can try a bunch of different things. They have cocktails that come in tea pots. It's novel but I wouldn't get it again. Didn't feel like it was worth the price. 

Good on the other hand was mind blowing. The octopus was tender, baby gem salad was such a nice mix of flavours. Pide stole the show though it was so good we order another on at the end of the meal instead of getting dessert. Seared cauliflower is duck fat was damn good too"}
{"text":"Simply an amazing experience. We ordered a bunch of small and large plates to share. The small plates were brought as a first round of courses, then the large.

SERVICE: 5/5
Our server was attentive and made us feel at home. The rest of the staff (bussers, etc.) managed the process expertly - each dish was explained in detail, our drinks were kept full (including water - you can choose sparkling or still), and our place settings were removed after we finished all of our \"small plates\" and replaced with clean ones.

FOOD: 5/5
Dishes ordered: Small plates - Labneh, Crispy eggplant, Beets, Shakshouka, Squid, Ribs
Large plates - Fluke, Mussels, Halibut, Jeweled rice
Sides - Cauliflower, Couscous

My party of 7 loved everything we ordered. The standout dishes were the labneh, mussels, shakshouka, halibut, fluke, and the jeweled rice. The flavours were incredibly well-balanced, and the portion sizes were decent for the price paid. We left raving about the food, and my boyfriend and I have plans to return again in a week. We would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"tough act to follow
after barhop's perfection
but byblos aimed high

outstanding lamb ribs
the crispy eggplant: so-so
turkish dumplings? yessssssss

oxtail rice with kale
swoonworthy. we stuffed ourselves.
nice, strong cocktails, too

the main problem here:
true identity crisis
club music, bright lights

an odd weekend mix
beautiful spot, but too bright
thus, minus a star"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here as one of the celebrations on our 11 year anniversary.

It's kinda situated underground and there's a door man to open the door for you..fancy ;) LOL
The ambience at the time we went at 8pm was dim, and candle lit with a slight hustle and bustle kind of a setting. It was romantic, but also private and intimate because of the noise level. 

It's kind of a tapas place. You order multiple dishes and you share it. There aren't many \"mains\".
The food was so interestingly delicious. The fusion of Eastern European and Middle Eastern food is something I have never had before and to have those two combinations in all in one was very cool! 

The service was very helpful and friendly considering it was very busy for a Wednesday night!

Oh! and the Allstate guy was sitting right next to us, so we were in good hands :'D"}
{"text":"I have a feelings that the middle Eastern Fried chicken tasted better last time I came here three months back. This time it was little bit bitter, and overcooked. But I will give it another chance for sure."}
{"text":"If you like Khabouth you will like Byblos. Expect the same beautiful interior, professional service, high end bar and hit and miss food as you get with other others but this one has an Eastern European spin.  

The Cheese Acharuli (Georgian bread) was worth it at $9.

The squid ($13) was decent if you don't mind the intense garlic flavour of toum although I wish the squid was a little more present instead of being so thinly sliced and covered in copious amounts of breading.

I found the eggplant kibbeh overpriced at $14. You get two small pieces of moderately spiced eggplant covered in chickpea batter with a dipping sauce.  

I always enjoy spins on classic cocktails and the date old fashioned was no exception. Served with the signature big ass ice cube, it was a little sweet but an interesting twist.

All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"Great food and even greater service. we had a birthday party for my best friend and the entire experience was awesome and unforgettable. Food was good quality, we had 5 girls with 8 dishes and two desserts, more than enough food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been to Byblos 4 times this past year. Its safe to say that this is our favorite restaurant in Toronto.
I'm the type of person who would normally choose Japanese, Chinese, or Korean food over any other cuisine. However Byblos is always an exception. The food is consistently delicious. The atmosphere is comfortable. The service is exceptional. Byblos ranks up there with all our favorite fine dining restaurants in New York and at only a fraction of the price. Definitely go here.

Recommendations:
- Shakshouka 
- Crispy Eggplant
These two are on our always-order list."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 2 early in the week and earliest available time was 8:15pm on Wed. One thing you don't want to do before a nice meal is to ruin it with a huge ice-cream.  The dinner was with mom, the ambience was great, service was great. It's definitely not one of those super fancy restaurants where you need to look all dressed up and act nothing but quite and polite.

Moving onto the food.

I'm never good with names so I'll just create my own for the food we ordered based on their main ingredients.

Eggplant kibbeh - probably the best of the whole night. Perhaps it was the first dish served and we were starving.

Squid ink cracker w salmon dips - loved it. The dip was typical. The to go dish if you want something safe and good.

Turkish dumplings - yogurt based, I liked the creamy taste which went well with the funky shape of the dumplings.

Some kind of rice - I really don't recall the name, maybe because I wasn't impressed. I wasn't expecting to get full with the rice but that was what happened at the end. 

Cabbage - why did I order this. I appreciate the waitress recommending us to get some greens as we apparently ordered like carnivores. But this was simply too salty for us. 

Overall the food was alright. I enjoyed the ambience and the service a lot though. 

3 and a half star for the food. The other half for the friendly waitress we had."}
{"text":"Sometimes I find myself too critical on giving 5 star worthy review. The food, service and atmosphere was good but I guess my first hesitation was that there wasn't to-many wow items but I did enjoy the whole experience. It won't make the top ten in its price point."}
{"text":"I came here because one of my coworkers told me it was \"the best food he's ever had in Toronto\". I would say it's *the* best, but it's definitely up there.

Before I mention what I ordered, I really have to hand it to the service. Our waiter seemed to always know exactly what was going on at our table, offered a lot of advice/recommendations while we were ordering stuff, and overall, just did a great job of making sure we had a great dining experience.


We accidentally ordered the lamb leg instead of the lamb ribs, but it was worth it. The lamb was ridiculously tender, and it reminded me of the bo ssäm at Momofuku. It was a little too much for two people to finish though, we had to pack it up afterwards.

We also had the roasted red beets, seared cauliflower, and duck kibbeh - everything was really good. I'll definitely go back some time to taste the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"have visited bylos 4 times and don't think I'll go back. the quality of food is deteriorating. we ordered the striploin and it was extremely tough. everything else was mediocre too. you can have a better experience at many other places on king west. I would note that the service is still great but I would go somewhere with better food."}
{"text":"really enjoyed the ambiance and food here, worth it!  I wouldn't say this is the best place i've eaten downtown, but it's up there."}
{"text":"Our supper club died and went to heaven after this meal. The best dish was the slow braised Ontario Lamb Leg, hands down! The meat fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. They serve it with tortillas and sides so you can make mini wraps. We also ordered the house labneh, eggplant, ocopus, steak tartare, crispy squid, halibut, cauliflour, couscous and barbari bread. Everything was amazing. Service was on point and the servers were very knowledgeable. The resto is on two floors and has beautiful decor throughout. I normally don't eat at the same restaurant twice, but this is one I can go to again and again. If you are ever in Toronto, eat here because you will feel like a local and much cooler after you leave."}
{"text":"Food wise, they're doing a decent job here. It doesn't feel like a classically trained Middle Eastern chef doing fusion, it feels like a classically trained caucasian chef doing Middle Eastern fusion food. The result in my opinion is a playful and creative menu, but the dishes often stray too far from their original concept or have a severe balance issue - heavy handed on spices, too much sweetness, bitter finishes, and so on.

There are certainly some standout dishes, but the experience is really soured by poor service, that just doesn't match the price point, and seems to be getting much worse with time. For the few times i've been here since 2016, I've been disappointed by arrogant servers, poor timing, lack of simple service expectations like clearing plates and glasses, topping up wine, etc. The style of service is also rather rushed, with dishes appearing whenever they're ready, with little thought given to what's already on the table, or what needs to be paired, etc. 

Overall, I'm done with Byblos. I give them kudos for their creativity but the food needs work and service will keep me away. There is however, so much potential here. 

It's of no surprise to me that the restaurant didn't make it either in a Middle Eastern market (in Dubai), shutting it's door in under a year after open (in Dubai Byblos was called Morah due to a trademark issue). Further demonstrating the issue of a fusion first approach."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with a friend of mine. 
We ordered the duck kabbeh, tuna cerviche, oxtail & kale basmati rice, a side of seared cauliflower, and the Cornish hen (main) - all
to share. Plus a bottle of Lobetia Tempranillo (Spain 2013, $65). 

Overall I was disappointed but my friend enjoyed it. I guess I'm the pickier of the two. I felt the 3 duck kabbeh (small plate) were a bit burnt; I didn't enjoy the dollop of tahini & fig drizzle they came with. 

Tuna cerviche was at first not flavorful (needed salt) and tasted one dimensional. But once we got to the buttermilk sauce underneath and poured that on top
Of the squid blue ink chips it was more
flavorful. I didn't like the chips - tasted burnt to me - but my friend pointed out that may be the taste of the squid ink. You get 6 chips in total. 

We sat at the bar as we didn't have a reservation and the bartender was helpful and able describe the different dishes. He recommended the seared cauliflower and oxtail kale rice. I preferred the rice more than the cauliflower. The Cornish hen was a full hen that was quartered and tasted good. 

We had enough food for 3 people (we were only 2 so we took the leftovers to go). 

I wouldn't go back personally d/t cost to enjoyment ratio. Thankfully I had lovely company! 

The ambience was nice; we sat upstairs."}
{"text":"This was probably the best Mediterranean restaurant that I have been to!  Everything about my dining experience was great!

I was seated in the dining area upstairs, which had a really nice bar and contemporary, but cozy decor (with a subtle hint of middle eastern influence).  The couches were so comfortable!  The only issue is that it is quite loud when the dining room is filled, but it is because it is a great place for larger groups/socials.

The servers were very helpful.  They had an extensive wine list, but they also had some interesting cocktails.  I did try a cocktail, which was fine and not unlike other cocktails you would find elsewhere.  

The most amazing part was the food.  It was so delicious and fresh, with unique flavors!.  The fig salad was refreshing.  The crispy couscous and mejadra rice were amazing as well.  The dessert (crispy qatayef) was good, but not as spectacular as the entrees we had.  

Although slightly more pricey than other mediterranean restaurants, I think the experience and quality of food that you get here are worth the money.  The servings were actually quite big and we had to bring home leftovers!  

I highly recommend this restaurant and plan to come back!  I think it is a great place to come with friends and share plates, so you get to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. 

I will come back next time I am in Toronto. Everything was phenomenal. The drinks, the food, the service, the decor... everything.

We got a reservation on a Friday night with half hour notice, as long as we left the table by 8:30. The waitress was super nice, attentive, funny, and got everything to us quickly but didn't make us feel rushed. 

Drink: The geographer - perfect. silky and frothy from the egg yolk.
Food:
House labneh - creamy, great balance with the sweet honey and the spiced bread
Fig salad - meh, it was good, the dressing was interesting, my friend loved it, I thought it was good but not as special as the other things we ate
Turkish Dumplings - our favorite! The eggplant was smokey and delicious, the sauce creamy without being too creamy. This probably would have been overwhelming as the only dish, but with everything else was perfect
Black Cod- meh, it was good, cooked perfectly, interesting sauces.. but just our least favorite of the dishes
Brussel Sprouts - roasted brussels and cheese.. it can't be bad.

We overordered- would have been fine with 2 fewer dishes. I wish we had ordered the Labneh, dumplings, and maybe some other vegetable and had room for dessert."}
{"text":"Byblos has top-notch food in a very trendy environment. 

The restaurant is striking - you walk in and immediately realize that you won't mind if you take a while to make up your mind on the extensive menu, because you'll feel so hip while you do it. Byblos is sunken at ground level, and the inside looks right out of a modern European design catalog, but somehow more comfortable. It's very loud, but that's because everyone is excited to be there and be eating the food.

Our food was excellent. The fig salad stood out as one of the best salads I've every eaten - it was huge, but we finished every last bite. It had plenty of different ingredients to keep you interested throughout. Our pide (cheese and truffles) was also incredible, and we didn't waste a crumb of that either. It was surprisingly light, but just rich enough to satisfy any diner. Finally, we had a baked fish in yogurt. It was moist, flavorful, flaky, and well-textured. Overall, the meal was one of the best I've had in Toronto. 

The drinks were not-quite-stellar, though they were good. My companions was far too sweet to finish, and mine was bitter to a fault. Regardless, the presentation of both was excellent. 

The service was good, and the meal moved at a reasonable pace. The waitress was fun (if a bit slower than we would've liked sometimes) and gave us some good suggestions on the large menu.

Overall, I'd suggest going to Byblos on a date night or to catch up with an old friend you want to impress."}
{"text":"Byblos was a very interesting experience for me. I've never had a driving urge to try it, but recognized that the quality and experience were in all likelihood top tier. My first trip there did not disappoint. The décor, ambiance and service left little more to be desired.

For me the food can most simply be described as elevated middle-eastern. Contemporary renditions of classics you'd find in Turkish, Arabic, Israeli and Persian food all wrapped up, refined, and beautifully plated. The biggest hit for me was the braised lamb, tender, rich and saporous. But other can't-miss items included the lamb ribs, mante dumplings, pide and fried couscous. There were a number of other dishes on the menu that jumped out at me, so I may need to return for more.

You're not coming here for your souvlaki fix, shawarma plates or a gyro sandwich, but it's a welcome shift from the more traditional Middle Eastern and Mediterranean options that people often associate with the cuisine."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Byblos on the final night of our stay in Toronto, and it was a good finale for our trip.
 
We sat downstairs, near the open kitchen prep area, which was lovely.
 
Since the restaurant recommends sharing, we selected dishes that were vegetarian, since I don't eat meat, and nut-free, since my husband is allergic to nuts. We let our waitress know about my husband's allergy, and she said it wasn't a problem with any of the dishes we selected, and that only one dish would need a small modification.

Our choices:
- Crispy baby artichoke: The labneh and grilled bread that came with this dish were delicious, but the artichoke itself didn't do anything for me. There's another mezze on the menu that's similar, but leaves out the artichoke--I'd recommend ordering that instead. (For anyone else with a nut allergy, this dish normally has some sort of nutty garnish, so be sure to let your server know that it should be skipped.)

- Black truffle pide: I love halloumi cheese, but it overpowered everything else in the bread.

- Turkish manti dumplings: We were most excited about these, since we had read Yelp reviews about them beforehand. I love smoky eggplant, and the dumplings had a nice melt-in-your-mouth consistency, but the dish was too salty.

- Mejadra (rice with lentils and fried shallot): This and the crispy artichoke (minus the artichoke itself) were our favorites. The rice was nice and fluffy, and perfectly spiced.

- Pavlova: A lot of Byblos' desserts are nutty, and there were several that I would have loved to try, but we went with the pavlova, since it was nut-free. It's a relatively light dessert since it's meringue, and I didn't think the rose flavor in the pastry cream was overwhelming, but I could see how others might think otherwise.

The quantity of food (4 savory dishes, 1 dessert) was just right for the two of us. If you're also going the vegetarian route, I'd recommend trying to add something green, like a salad or the brussel sprouts, for a little better balance. Service is good and attentive. This was the most expensive of our meals during our Toronto trip, but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Every now and then, a restaurant is so memorable that you find yourself planning the NEXT visit even before you meal has ended - Byblos is THAT place. It's a dining benchmark in this city and I hope the Miami outpost is as good.

I have visited twice - so this review is a combination of both - and I am looking forward to the next visit. The service is well informed, gracious and unobtrusive yet attentive. The staff is obviously experienced and can read their tables quite well. Both visits, my servers really took care to \"tour\" the menu sharing personal favourites. The sommelier was also a great complement to the meal.

The house labneh, I could eat every day on everything with a spoon, thanks to the sweet honey balanced by the salt of the barbari bread. The Roma salad is so refreshing and light. The lamb ribs are a MUST if you are a carnivore - so tender with lovely texture. Even my vegetarian date approved. The fig salad again has such a subtle sweetness balanced with the pistachio - you really find yourself savouring each bite so as not to lose out on any notes. If you like fish, the branzino is outstanding with the charmoula offering tang to the vine leaves. Both the Sweet Jewelled rice and the Oxtail rice are not to be missed. The Sweet Jewelled rice is a very light accompaniment to the fish and is just so pretty to look at. The Oxtail rice is a meal on its own (and makes great leftovers!).

What is still delicious but not on my favourites list would be the Shakshouka, the Manti dumplings and the Crispy Squid. The Shakshouka and Squid were yummy and well prepared but not unlike many other restaurants that serve the same dishes. The Manti dumplings had incredible depth of flavour but I didn't like the texture (my personal thing - you should still try them).

I'm new to Yelp but eat out A LOT and Byblos is certainly outstanding as far as Toronto restaurants are concerned. You will be wowed."}
{"text":"Had an incredible dinner here. Everything was unique. There were just two of us and no reservations available so we chanced getting a seat at the bar.  The waiter was very helpful in explaining the dishes. We shared two appies - beets and eggplant, two entrees - cod and noodles and couscous."}
{"text":"This place is finger licking good. Came here for friend's birthday ordered 7 dishes ... Entrees are served communal style and made for sharing..don't get angry about the portion sizes because each item is decadent and filling, can't go wrong with lamb ribs finger down the throat good. Also the ambiance and house made dessert items are off the chart such as their pistachio ice cream. It is on the pricey side but the ambiance and the exotic flavourful dishes are worth it."}
{"text":"One of my all-time fav restaurants. I've been here twice and have never been disappointed. If you're going to try Byblo's I suggest coming with a group you are comfortable sharing plates with - the menu is designed to be shared. Appetizers and salads range from $10-15 while mains all between $15-30 (++ for market price items). Here are some menu items you need to try... appetizer: in-house labneh with braided bread; salad: fig salad; main: crispy squid (amazing!), yogurt-baked fluke (a fish baked in a yogurt sauce), b.c. mussels. I might also suggest a side of Persian rice to go with your meal. If you're willing to split items, this can become a very affordable meal at a top Toronto restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lovely place. Cauliflower and the tuna ceviche were very nice. So was the beet and cheese thing. Left full and happy. Service was laidback but prompt too."}
{"text":"The Food was soo tasteful
We had tapas amongst 4
Great service
Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is a very nice upscale Middle Eastern restaurant. We came here for dinner on a Wednesday night and it didn't seem too crowded, but I'd recommend making a reservation to be safe. The service staff was all very friendly, and the ambiance was nice.

Two important prefaces before getting to the food. First, come with friends. Everything is designed to be shared, so it's best if you have a party of 2-4. This will let you enjoy a nice variety of dishes. Second, you get what you pay for, so expect to spend ballpark $75 per person (assuming a good-sized meal and 1 drink per person).

Now to the food: the dishes were all very good, though obviously some more so than others. Pretty much everything was cooked and seasoned exceptionally well. Many of our dishes had a lot of sour dairy (e.g. yogurt), which I wasn't a big fan of - but if you like that, then you're in business. I really really enjoyed the black truffle pide and the roasted lamb shoulder (amazingly done). The persian kale rice was also quite good. I usually love brussels sprouts, but I was unfortunately a bit disappointed with the ones here (I would've liked them more roasted and with less yogurt). The labneh and the eggplant kibbeh were both nice appetizers, if you like those things. Lastly, the drink menu was very good (unless you like beer - they pretty much only do wine, cocktails, and spirits).

Overall, we had a very nice time. Due to the high price, it's not the kind of place I'd go very often. However, for a special night out, this is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Original, excellent rapport qualité prix, service sympa, décoration magnifique. Demandez la salle du haut. Le vin est toujours cher mais on s'en passe. Les desserts sont fantastiques."}
{"text":"Good food cool decor, server was very helpful and sweet however she was very busy (on a weeknight), which takes away from service time. We waited 15 min for our drink order! Besides that, well worth checking out."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! A place with amazing food and good for groups. The dishes are smaller portions meant for sharing so it's great to be able to try lots of different things. They also have a lot of vegetarian options. 

The cocktails are all delicious, but a must try is the geographer, which is very light and refreshing. 

Favourite appetizers include the black truffle pide with halloumi cheese and dumplings. Both are extremely flavourful.

For the main, you cannot go wrong with any of the rice dishes. I have tried a variety of them and they are all amazing! 

All desserts are absolutely delicious and again great for sharing. If you are too full, make room for the pizzelle, which is a fancy ice cream sandwich!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about Byblos. 
The food is incredible - sets the bar for everyone else in the city. 
Fresh flavours blend beautifully without feeling overwhelming. 
The service was fantastic as was the overall atmosphere. 
I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I  could not  wait to  check out  this  location  after  discovering  it on Yelp and seeing all their  photos  on instagram.  I got The Geographer (gin,  of course ) and it was  very   yummy .  We then got the octopus, lamb ribs, and some duck  dish ,  along with  some rice. Every  dish  had its own  uniqueness  to it, whether it's the meat-veggie  combo , or the spices and flavours of the  meal . Every  first  bite was  nearly  like a surprise, and  eating  here was  a great deal  of  fun .  The wait time for each  meal  was reasonable.  Whatever  is  suggested  to be shared so it  seemed like  I was  constantly   consuming ! The  portions  were all on the  smaller sized  end and if you are  a big  eater,  watch out for  your wallet!!   One thing  I  also  liked about the  place  was the interior  decor ."}
{"text":"Really nice decor. Great cocktails. Overall a really lovely experience. Would definitely go back. A bit pricey but worth it for a nice night out with folks you enjoy! Life is short. Do it."}
{"text":"The \"wood fire grill\" section of the menu should say pizza. It's wicked good and basturma is legit like eatin cheetos after you smoke weed. Too many stiff dates here tho lots of sport coat & jean looking types of people. Bartender crushed recommendations and the fig salad is bomb. I went with a really good friend who was fired from there and she still goes back that's how good it is. BYBLOS PRONOUNCED BIB-LI-OS ps eat upstairs"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to dine at Byblos for a long time and I regret for waiting so long! The food here is so delicious! Every dish has its own unique flavour and personality that just makes you want to savour every bite. 

We ordered a bunch dishes to try and the most stand it dishes were the lamb ribs, Turkish Manti Dumplings and the Wagyu Lahmeh flat bread. The cod and rice was just ok for me but my friends loved it. If you are going with friends. It's best to go with a group of 4 because every dish just happens to come in 4 pieces. 

Service was great and I love the decor of the resto.  The price is on the higher end but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I expected more with Byblos - there is a lot of hype and buzz around it, so needless to say, I was disappointing when I went. The food was fine, and the service was great, but it is definitely not all that it is expected to be. Definitely a good choice if you are looking for a \"fancier\" restaurant in Toronto, but don't expect the food to be incredible."}
{"text":"One word - YUM! The city lacks Mediterranean food and this place definitely makes up for it. The menu has so many amazing and unique options to choose from that makes you want to come back to try each dish. My favorite dish of the night was the \"Middle Eastern Fried Chicken.\" Don't judge me and go try the dish for yourself! KFC should take lessons from Byblos - this is what you truly call \"Finger Licking Good.\"

The only downside, not really, is that the place is quite dark if you go during the night to take pics #turn on your cam light for me to take a pic pls! 

Highly recommended and will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. The place was off a small street (Duncan), the billowing curtain was a bit odd, but inside it's an open concept kitchen - which I find very cool.

Food: 4/5  
For Appetizer: ordered the Cheese Acharuli & Lamb Ribs. Lamb ribs - as others have sang its praises, is fell off the bones tender. Cheese Acharuli is pretty good, but I feel I could find similar tasting pastry in other bakeries.

For Mains: Crispy Squid & Yogurt Baked Fluke. Crispy Squid - while good, taste like calamari, which you can get elsewhere. Yogurt Baked Fluke was expensive, the fish portion was small, while it tasted good, not worth it.

Rice: Mejadra - hint of cinnamon, not overpowering. Taste good, but I like non-sweet rice, maybe next time I'll try another rice.

Dessert: Pavlova - not worth it at $12, a bit too sweet and I feel their meringue is not done as well as other places, i.e. it's hard to crack it in the first place.

Food in order of most well liked dish to least: Lamb ribs, mejadra, cheese acharuli, crispy squid, yogurt baked fluke, least favourite is pavlova.

Service: 5/5 - the waiter came by several times to check up, and suggested menu items, very knowledgeable about portion sizes and made sure I didn't over order

Ambiance: 3/5 - I dislike very very dark restaurants where I cannot see my food (and they seated me in the very very dark area)

Total came to about $105 pre-tip, conclusion - food is great, ambiance is great, perhaps next time I'll try other dishes."}
{"text":"First half of the meal: great
Second half of the meal: a salt bomb

Which is unfortunate because the underlying flavours were quite interesting, but the salt level was so high that we couldn't finish 2 of the 6 dishes we ordered. 

As others have noted, it's tapas/shared dishes style and they recommend about 3 dishes per person (small, large, side - mix and match)

The first three dishes to come were great.

Crispy squid - basically calamari with a yummy garlicky sauce and a chili sauce. Not particularly inventive but well done

Roasted beets - great mix of flavours with the yogurt and bread

Crispy eggplant - good. Not as smoky as I expected from reviews here, but quite yummy. Not vegetarian though as I expected from the menu - it's tipped with dried shaved beef. Really really good dried shaved beef but not to the liking of the non-meat-eater at dinner. 

Then they changed our plates and brought out the salt. 

Crispy hand-rolled couscous on greens. Really good for the first two bites. Then it tasted like salt. Couldn't finish

Sabzi basmati. Interesting flavours, beautifully cooked rice. But again way too heavy on the salt. We couldn't finish it. 

Arctic char. I can't say honestly. The skin was salty, which might have been ok if I hadn't just had the previous two dishes. 

And the \"Turkish delight\" tea was made with water that was too tepid. 

If they could get the salt shaker under control, I'd go back. But after this meal I wouldn't hurry."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place.  Highly recommended.  Wonderful food.   I have been here several times with family, friends, and for business dinners.  My recommendation is to go with several people to be able to order more dishes to experience the variety of options.   The flavours, fresh ingredients, wonderful use of spices that will have you enjoying every bite. 

I will not go in to each dish I have tried, as there are too many to remember.... I did rely on the waiters and waitresses to recommend dishes which they did.  They were very knowledgeable and did not steer me wrong.  Every dish was brilliant each and every time. 

The wine list is very good as well.   Great selection to pair with the variety of dishes.  

If you like eastern Mediterranean, Turkish and Moroccan cuisine, you will not be disappointed.  

Enjoy and eat well !"}
{"text":"Wow. What a meal! I'm already planning my next visit here!

I came here on a fellow yelpers recommendation and it was a great one! From cocktails to dessert, I am so satisfied with my meal.

We started with cocktails - I had the Negroni (which they have on tap) which was excellent, and I also got to try the first two on the list, both of which were excellent. They also have an extensive wine list which we ordered from, the Italian red by the glass is a great choice! 

Now the delicious food - our server recommended we order two dishes per person. We decided on two large plates (the fluke and the Cornish hen), two small plates (citrus olives, Roma salad) one side (seared cauliflower) and one rice (jewelled basmati). 

Literally everything was perfect and delicious. The flavours are unreal, the combinations are perfect. The rice has pomegranates, honeyed carrots and pistachios - heaven! The cauliflower was hands down the best side vegetable I have ever had the pleasure of eating - the combination of tahini, sesame seeds and the crispy parsley is just perfection. 

I can't recommend giving Byblos a try enough - I can't wait to try it again!!"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant in the entertainment district that doesn't offend. Byblos is good, nothing mind blowing, but very yummy. The prices probably don't warrant the 'homeyness' of the food but I'd still go back for a drink and an app. The menu items are presented and described with elegance but come out a little more rustic than expected. The details in each aren't easily recognized but more written down to assure the patron that they are authentic. We get it, you know what tahini and toom and figs are. You're very legit, I know. But overall things were good."}
{"text":"If I could give Byblos more stars, I would. The atmosphere ambience servers etc etc all amazing but the food! Omg the foodddd, if I could eat it everyday, I would gladly do so. Just came home from our 2nd vday dinner there, my fifth visit overall, and they truly never cease to amaze me. The quality of food is top notch & frankly incomparable to other restaurants of this cuisine. Favs are the labneh, fig salad, mejadra rice, crispy sabzi, duck or eggplant kibbeh, middle eastern fried chicken, crispy squid, octopus - I'm rambling, I'll stop and just say they do it all very, very well! Go-to cocktail is the Rose gulab - add that & end off with the Turkish coffee, perfection in a meal :)"}
{"text":"Bold statement (luckily I can edit my review later if needed) BUT I think Byblos is my favourite restaurant in Toronto.

The food is absolutely AMAZING:
- Dry Aged Ribeye (wow)
- Fig Salad
- Black Truffle Pide (!!!)
- Black Truffle Rice
- Steak Tartare
- Turkish Mantis Dumplings
- Roasted Red Beets

I normally love mussels/seafood and creamy dishes but did not like the mussels or yogurt baked fluke here."}
{"text":"We went after Byblos had been open for a couple of weeks.  I made an online reservation at 4pm for 6pm, and was given a confirmation within minutes.  Very speedy.

The two levels are beautiful inside.  We sat upstairs, which had a wonderfully cozy buy airy ambiance.  A great place to take a date or celebrate a birthday or anniversary.

I could very easily try every cocktail on their list, but at $11-18 a pop, we just stuck with the one drink.  I had a date-infused Old Fashioned, which was delicious and not overly sweet.

Our waitress was extremely attentive and chatty.  We never had to flag anyone down for water or to get the bill.  In fact, the place seemed to be over-staffed (I think we were asked by 5 different people if we enjoyed our meal), but it's always better to be over-attended to than under, in my opinion.

We shared several smaller dishes, including: 

- Roasted red beets with pistachios, caraway and labneh, served with Barbari flatbread
- Turkish dumplings (manti) with eggplant, yoghurt sauce and molasses 
- Lamb Ribs with buttermilk sauce, carob molasses and red chilis
- Seared cauliflower with sesame
- Steamed mussels in a spicy broth

This was the perfect amount of food for me, though my male date mentioned he could order more!  Everything was delicious and a wonderful blend of various spices and flavours.  The lamb ribs were a particular stand-out for me - I probably could have had 5 more orders of it.  No overtly mutton-like flavour, and the meat fell neatly off the bone.  Mmmm.

I enjoyed the cauliflower, though it was a bit salty.  I felt a parched after eating it.  Still, very tasty. 

Our food (plus two cocktails) came to just under $100. 

Moderately priced. Great service, Beautiful ambiance.  Delicious, well-put together food and drinks.  I will definitely be returning - though it will probably be in celebration of something (can't afford to indulge in wonderful things all the time!)"}
{"text":"If you're in Toronto for a short, or long, time, this HAS to be on your dining list.
This is where I take all my foodie, hard-to-please friends. Always get a glowing review and promises to return with more friends after :) The seating area upstairs has a loungey feel with low couch-like seating and tables arranged to make it easier to share. The downstairs area is smaller and just seemed a bit more crowdy and less intimate.
The menu is designed to be shared and plates are listed in order of smallest to largest portion size.
Cheese Acharuli: quail egg nestled in brioche, seasoned with za'atar. Great to share. Unique flavor. I didn't know what to expect the quail egg to taste like, and all I can say is it tasted GRREAT. Couldn't even tell it was egg. The bread was soft and flavorful - not your average slice. 

Lamb ribs: Absolutely gorgeous. Crispy on the outside, dotted with sesame seeds, and tender on the inside. It's technically listed in the apps section. You get 4 pieces per serving, which can be a little dissatisfying if you're sharing with more than person (they're THAT yummy). Our party of 3 ordered it with apps, went through an entire meal including steak, then ordered ANOTHER plate of the ribs as dessert.

Turkish manti dumplings: great portion size, great flavour that I can't quite put a finger on. The dumplings swim in a yogurt-based sauce which is packed with flavor. I didnt mind that you can't really taste the eggplant. I'm a meat-lover and never opt for a vegetarian main, but have ordered this repeatedly cuz the flavor is SO robust.

Chargrilled Cornish Hen: I'd recommend this for a party of 4 or more, just because the serving size is large so it limits how many other things you can try. You get 4 (I think) pieces in some kind of a pot, with fried leek. I found this to be one of the more standard-tasting dishes on the menu, not that it's mediocre; just doesn't pack as much flavor as the afore-mentioned dishes. Goes great with a side of the Mejadra Basmati Rice (order separately, also large serving)."}
{"text":"With such an interesting and large menu, you can craft up an amazing dinner with a lot of great flavours.  It's probably one of the most diverse menus I've seen in Toronto and one I'm hoping to try more of... especially with the great service we got here!

Near the theatre district, you have this chill and modern vibe where the open prep kitchen lets you see a bit of the foods that gets plated and have you peering over to the near tables to see what great dishes come out. 

I have to mention that the service here is just incredible... it's not the quiet or bespoke service that I expected but rather it was a warm, friendly, and informative staff that just made this a comfortable and welcoming place.  So if you're worried about dining in this upscale spot... don't be.  This service is just right.

As for the food... LOTS of great options but I have to say that these plates are deceiving.  I thought we wouldnt have enough... turns out we probably over ordered.  We definitely could have cut out one dish easily.  They're very filling in a great way.  There are definitely some 'must order' dishes and some otherwise 'decent' dishes.

Fried artichoke with labneh - In most people's mind, hummus is one of the first things that come up on a Mediterranean menu.  Byblos doesn't have hummus... they've got something better.  Their labneh is creamier and has a mild tang of the natural yogurt and lemon note that elevates it.  The best part... the fried artichoke that sits on top of it.  It's crispy and perfect as a compliment to the smooth labneh.  Another great part, it comes with a crunchy flat bread that has tons of flavour because of the dose of spices ... perhaps za'atar.  5/5

Turkish eggplant manti dumplings - Another delicious dish that brought exceptional flavour.  This one had the smokier eggplant tucked into delicate parcels.  The use of the tangy yogurt and sweetened molasses just complimented everything.  I think we scooped everything including the sauce 5/5

12 hour braised lamb with assorted sides - This is possibly one of the best lamb i've had in a long time... it is no exaggeration when I say that you can cut the lamb with a spoon.  We honestly did that.  It was so tender and flavourful.. best part, you have a lot of variety of pickles and sauces to add to the lamb in a little wrap.  If I could eat this weekly, I would be a very happy vegetarian (Yes, I'm mostly vegetarian except for dishes like this that happily keeps me trying more meat.  I'm sure it also keeps my dining partner more than happy about that too)  5/5

Seared Cauliflower (side) - I think one side dish was more than enough and between the two... the seared cauliflower was the stronger one.  Though it was cooked in duck fat, I didnt taste any of the savoriness of it.  The tahini sauce did rescue this one from being too boring.  3.5/5

Roasted Brussel Sprouts (side) - This was cooked well (not raw) but it was just a little more mundane and less flavourful compared to the previous dishes.  It would be hard to compete with the lamb or dumplings but it's a green... and I like my vegetables but this one I could have done without.  3/5

Pavlova - So check out my video on this dish and you'll see why I say that this dessert is all about theatrics.  Whimsical, fun, and interesting presentation ... it doesnt stop there.  It also tastes very very good too.  Strawberry flavour bursting out and the pavlova bits isn't overly sugary.  I can easily order this again and again.  Definitely one of the most memorable desserts I've had all year  5+/5  

Seeing how we went to Bar Sybanne the week before and had a great meal there... it was interesting to compare it to Byblos.  Both are excellent for their respective takes on the Mediterranean flavour.  They both have excellent service and atmosphere... if anything, they're both quite alike there.  For the food, Byblos brings a better menu and presentation.  It also costs nearly double of Bar Sybanne.  I would say that both are deserving to try and enjoy... maybe Byblos would be a special occasion instead of your great weekend spot."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in the city. You never get enough of this place, everything is extremely delicious."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4.5/5. I really liked a lot of the foods we ordered. Some of my favourites and recommendations are the Manti dumplings, ribeye, focaccia bread with Greek yogurt dip, and fig salad. I would also recommend getting a cocktail as well. I had a nightingale sour, the flavours and even texture of the drink were so good! 

I was not the biggest fan of some of the deserts. Presentation for them was awesome, but my burnt honey ice cream had a slightly icey/grainy texture instead of a nice creamy mouthfeel. However, I tried the chocolate mousse and I really enjoyed the dish."}
{"text":"Coming across their social media I was expecting a totally different restaurant. Firstly, the ambiance was very dark, in the pictures the area looks like it had a lot of sunlight coming through but it just seemed very dull. 

I ordered the roasted beets with labneh. This was really good especially with the crispy bread it was served with. The olive oil mixed with beets and labneh with pistachios added a nice flavour without it being heavy. 

I also order a spinach and cheese pizza. The pizza overall did not have enough flavour and it seemed soggy. 

I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to dine here. We were a large private group renting out the entire upper floor, so were not seated in the main restaurant.

Dishes we tried:

Fel Fel (marinated spices olives) - Tasty olives but what more can I saw, pretty much what you would expect!

Crispy Eggplant - These came out as small deep-fried fritters, sort of looked like fried zucchini blossoms. Absolutely delicious.

Lamb Ribs - WOW. These were my favourite dish. Meat was tender and fall off the bone, but had a crispy and salty exterior. 

Turkish Manti Dumplings - Small diamond shaped dumplings stuffed with a blended smoked eggplant filling. 

Local Roma Salad - Definitely the healthiest thing we had, green salad topped with a light dressing and pomegranate seeds.

Chargrilled Cornish Hen - Again, delicious, served with a lentil sauce. 

Sweet Jeweled Basmati Rice - contained saffron and almonds

Dry Aged Ribeye - Served with a Za'atar (Persian spice) butter and smoked eggplant.


Overall I would like to return to try more of the vegetarian type dishes. I am a meat lover and the meat here was DELICIOUS, but whoever planned our menu seemingly went a bit over the top with meat selections.

The main restaurant has a really interesting decor, seems almost quite 70s chic, would be a perfect date spot as many of the tables are small round ones with a circular booth seat."}
{"text":"It's a service review, I'm sure food is great. Hostess are very unprofessional! They made us wait 30min then told us we have to wait another 30!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've had in a long time!! Wow. Everything was high quality and bursting with flavour. Server was very nice and accommodating, we were able to get a table for 2 without problems but we came on a slow night (Sunday evening). A bit on the pricey side if you want to have a 3 course meal but totally worth the splurge for the experience. We shared the Roasted Beets appetizer which comes with Labneh to start, and had the Roasted lamb shoulder for 2 with the Sweet Jewelled rice. Great ambiance and decor too. Will definitely come again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal at Byblos. A bit different than traditional middle eastern fare but the appetizers and main were great. Family style sharing as we ordered 6 appetizers, 3 mains and rice for 8 people. Not too salty but flavourful ..

Unfortunately there's valet parking for $15 but there are cheaper parking lots around the area"}
{"text":"Fancy Mediterranean restaurant with fancy prices. ;)
However, it is well worth it! 
I have been here twice already. First visit was a 5 star, everything tasted great and perfect. 
Second time, few of the dishes I ordered previously didn't 'wow' me this time. 
Not sure what it was exactly, and my brother who was visiting for the first time even said it was 'meh'. Maybe it was just that day.. Idk. 
Portions are small, so if you are a group of 2, ordering 4-5 dishes will fill you up."}
{"text":"This was a first for me in trying some Eastern Mediterranean food. And I was very satisfied with that first experience.

From the outside, we weren't too sure if it was even open or not. But it didn't hurt to try the door.

Service was great. Water was always topped off. Our server asked us if it was our first time there and as it was, she explained to us how the dishes would be served, and gave us recommendations on how much and what to order. It helped a lot.

The girl who brought us our food was just as excellent. She also asked if it was our first time, and explained everything that was brought to our table and provided recommendations on how to eat it.

We ordered 4 dishes.

1. Crispy Squid. Pretty much like calamari, but they were very thinly sliced pieces of squid. Squid was not rubber and had a nice crispy/crunchy texture to the batter. Squeeze on a bit of lemon and you're on your way to heaven.

2. Middle Eastern Fried Chicken. These were amazing. At first glance you see all the spices on the chicken, and it's served along side some hot sauce(I'm not to good with spicy, and it was no problem for me). The chicken appears to be fried pretty dark but you'll be quick to find that it is NOT a lump of charcoal and that it is actually exceptionally juicy and loaded with flavour. It comes in for 2-3 bite pieces of chicken.

3. Seared Cauliflower. Cauliflower should not taste this good. It was loaded with flavour, almost to a fault as I could hardly taste the cauliflower. Kinda has a Ranch/Parmesan taste to it. Squeeze some lemon onto that, and it completely changed. I like it a lot, just a tad too strong with the ranch flavour.

4. Slow Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder. This was a recommendation of the server along with the seared cauliflower. Just as she had described it, the lamb was incredibly juicy and tender, fall of the bone kinda feel to it. Comes with these little pita-like breads and shawarma-esque sides. None of the sides were spicy, although one was supposed to give a bit of a kick, so don't be shy about the sides. The sides will add a picked flavour. Also want to point out that the lamb did not have a strong gamy Snell or flavour to it, it was very subtle. Even the lamb hater I was with loved it.

Our meal totalled to $100 and change with the lamb being 50% of the cost at market price.

Overall, excellent experience, excellent service, excellent food."}
{"text":"Service is stellar. Food is delicious. Been here one previous time. Byblos is definitely a staple of Toronto cuisine. What we tried recently:

Lamb ribs: really good, kinda crunchy, had a very middle eastern flavour (sorry for my limited vocab!)

Roasted red beets: best beets I ever had. The yogurt was really thick and fresh.

Fig Salad: Flavourful and fresh. Second best salada I ever had after Jacobs's cesar salad.

Spanish octopus: It's under the Large menu but it's really small. Just parts of the octopus. It was good and was presented well but I would try something else next time.

Pavlova for dessert: Super sweet. Very delicous. But again it's super super sweet. The turkish cotton candy was amazing though. Looks like white hair but so tasty."}
{"text":"Man man man... This restaurant right here is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. It's long been on my bookmark list and it lived up to every bit of he hype.

Located in downtown Toronto, Byblos is a Mediterranean restaurant serving up some truly amazing food in a contemporary atmosphere. The food is sort of taps style, so ordering multiple dishes is the way to go. It's well worth it as everything from the service to the decor is excellent, and then there's the food... I grabbed a seat the bar and the rest is history. 

I started off with the grilled Bronzino, which was outstanding. A nice amount of crisp, fish was tender and cooked perfectly and the sauce on top made the whole dish pop. I then had the seared cauliflower with tahini and coriander, which was delicious and very unique tasting. I also had the black cod which came wrapped in a vine leaf, amazing and incredibly flavorful.

Just when I thought things couldn't get any better, I got dessert, which ended up stealing the show. The Pizelle, which is baklava ice cream, salted caramel and cous cous praline... No words to describe how delicious this was. I've truly not tasted anything remotely close to this before. Simply put, mouthwatering. 

Bottom line, this is likely the best the restaurant in Toronto and for good reason. It's very hard to get a reservation here, so if that fails, definitely try coming at an off time and grabbing a seat at the bar. Even if you have to wait, it's well worth it as it will likely be one of the best meals you've ever had."}
{"text":"First time here and love this place. Plus great, efficient and warm service! Which is really rare in some good restaurants. 
We ordered Roast red beets for starter, it was really good, the barbaric bread was excellent. 
Second dish was Chanterelle mushroom, great choice too, very tasty and it brought the full flavour of mushrooms. Next time I wanna try the Black Truffle one. 
Rest dishes, 
short rib kebab: crispy outside and juicy tender inside 
yogurt baked fluke: very interesting dish, not on the bad side, never had fish this way, but still good, if you want try something new. 
confit duck rice: crispy shredded duck meat with jasmine rice (I think) it has a hint of sweetness in there some how I just love it. 
Dessert: crispy qatayef great with some Turkish coffee. 
Two of us finished everything! Highly recommend this place! I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes!"}

The service was excellent. Tara took really good care of us. She knew the menu down to the smallest detail. She even treated us for a complimentary dish (Organic House Labneh) because one of the servers forgot the bread."}
{"text":"Ordered the labneh, lamb ribs, turkish dumplings, chocolate mousse and ice cream. We felt that the labneh and lamb were a bit over-hyped but everything else was excellent. Service was very profession and decor was beautiful, but we had to wait 40 minutes for our first dish, which was fine as we weren't in a rush. A bit pricey as the came to over $50 before tax and tip, but a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. This place is insanely good. I haven't stopped talking about it since I went- I feel like I have a crush on this restaurant ha!

We were seated upstairs and it's a very beautiful restaurant. Our server was so friendly and came over to take our drink order and said to read over the menu and then she would help us make some decisions. I loved that because a lot of the dishes weren't english names or ingredients I was familiar with so I liked that she offered to help before I even had to ask. She helped us choose 6 dishes for the 2 of us as they are sharing style plates. 

We got the lamb ribs, spinach pide, black cod, green beans, halibut with walnuts, and a typical Turkish rice dish. I don't remember the specific names of each dish so I can't do them justice. The food was fantastic is all I can say. I've been to Turkey and Morocco and this food is authentic and even better than anything I ate in their home countries. The only thing that didn't blow me away was the green beans but even still they were quite good. 

Overall great experience. Beautiful restaurant, amazing service, outstanding food and drinks. I am obsessed with this restaurant and can't wait to return. It is pretty expensive but I happily paid my bill."}
{"text":"Uh. Oh my. Earns the hype. Great spot, world class charming staff. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Interiors are nice.

Went on a weekday night so wasn't that busy.

A bit pricey, but worth the experience.

I am vegetarian, so I was a bit apprehensive going there at first, but the dishes were so tasty and quite a lot to choose from!"}
{"text":"I am not a big repeat restaurant goer (always wanting to try something new - and in a fantastic city like Toronto I have that luxury) but this place is the exception.  I've been three times in six months and it's always perfection. The service is fab and the food is beyond good. Highly recommend the slow cooked lamb. We ordered a small one on last visit and it was perfection. But also the fish, the beets, the hand rolled cous cous, even the bread are all so special. Highly recommend this place for a special night. Pop a bottle of cava and get ready to feast!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend made reservations for our anniversary here. 
First impression as we got seated was that the interior is really unique and appealing. 
There was an open kitchen concept, so we can somewhat see what's going on.
The server that assisted us was very nice and attentive. 
She helped us with food choices and told us that most of the menu items are meant for sharing. 

We ordered : seared cauliflower, duck kibbeh , lamb ribs, Turkish manti dumplings, mejadra rice and yogurt mousse. 

I chose Seared cauliflower because of the good reviews on Yelp. Personally it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. My boyfriend likes the sauce it came with though. I give it a 3/5 

Duck kibbeh was chosen by my boyfriend, it was the first item that we got. It only comes with 3 pieces, but the taste is so unique compared to anything We have tried  before. There's so much dimension and flavours going on , I recommend this !!  5/5 

Lamb ribs was chosen again because of the many raves about it on Yelp. The lamb ribs ,to be honest are small portioned . I liked the texture of the ribs and the sesame seeds as well as the sauce it came with. This one was fairly decent. My boyfriend prefers the duck kibbeh though.    3.5/5 

Turkish manti dumplings is sooooooo good. Me and my boyfriend both liked it. At first glance it might seem not so much, but the yogurt sauce it came with was faboulous. 5/5 

Mejadra rice was another favourite. The scallons were absolutely delicious. The rice aren't the typical ones that me and my boyfriend experience. To me they seem a bit like noodles. According to my boyfriend , when you mix the rice with the yogurt, It taste better. 
The portion for the rice was huge unlike the other orders, so you'd end up with takeout if it's just 2 people.
5/5 

Last thing we got was the yogurt mousse. This one was absolutelllllyyyy fantastic. Out of the world , mindblowing!! Get it for sure if you come here!!
The servers brought this to our table and it said \"happy anniversary \" written in Turkish chocolate. 
The texture and flavour is so good, nothing compares to it. 
5/5

Overall I had a very good experience at Byblos, the servers were really nice and attentive. They refilled out water whenever we ran out. 
The food was amazing , we never had mediternian food before and this was a fantastic experience. 

The hand towels at the bathroom is also very good quality and thick. Which is surprising since restaurants try to cut back on those. 

Another thing that blew my Mind and made my day was that they didn't charge us the cake . They said it was on the house.
Not many restaurants will do this, and that's what surprised me. 

The dumplings and the rice are both vegetarian , I  consider myself as a meat eater and I didn't realize that it was vegetarian. It shows that eating healthy and being a vegetarian can be delicious as well. 

One minor complaint would be that since we had food remaining , we asked for takeout for those items
They seemed to forget about it?"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant very impressed ! The lamb ribs delicious , Tuna crevice a must , eggplant yum, squid and octopus exceptional as was the various dumplings and duck . Turkish coffee excellent and can't go wrong with the desserts !! Only complaint I had was the server who brought the food and described the ingredients spoke really fast and it seemed he was very board with saying the same thing over and over so could not understand him much but the meal was excellent as was the regular service re our waiter .. Will be going Back for sure !"}
{"text":"A little pricey for the small portions, but they were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This place was bookmarked for a while in my 'to eat' places before I move back to Australia. On a spur of the moment decision, my husband and I decided to go. We had searched the whereabouts of the restaurant at home but had still walked past it, as it was hidden and not in your face branded. It was 9:30pm on a Thursday night and it was still pretty buzzing. I loved the décor, the rounded intimate booths and home-style type pantry/bar when you first enter. 

We were escorted to the second floor and sat in a booth. Ordered a delicious Sicilian red wine and promptly ordered our food. Started off with the creamed spinach pide (a type of Greek bread) and Spanish octopus. The feta cheese just melted in the pide and the octopus was cooked perfectly, nice and chewy and full of flavour. 

Wagyu striploin and roasted brussels sprouts were the next set of dishes, don't really eat brussels sprout often but boy the flavour associated with it with the crunch of the roasted sprouts was a great combo. The Wagyu was mouth watering, medium rare (way to go) with the cauliflower hummus, amazing!

For dessert, we chose the Pavlova, now it isn't really Greek and we are spoilt for choice in Australia (because it started there or either NZ) but it wasn't quite our cup of tea, wasn't super gooey inside, seemed like it'd been in a fridge for a while but other than that, the food was great.

I highly recommend this place for a date night, or even semi-formal drinks with work or friends! Go there now! :)"}
{"text":"4.5 for food, and 5 for service.

Had a birthday dinner here for two on a weeknight. Made the reservation via OpenTable and requested a nice seat for a b'day celebration, I was impressed that they took note. We had a nice corner table with a good view of the restaurant.
Our server was wonderful! He took the time to explain and recommend stuff from the menu, and did not pressure us to order cocktails. Bonus points for that.
We had: 
1. Maltese Spiced Olives - I particularly enjoyed this, had a nice kick to it. Note, I don't normally like olives.
2. Organic House Labneh - this came with a serving of barbari bread. We both enjoyed this, the labneh is like a Lebanese cream cheese, with a slight sweet taste due to the pool of honey and olive oil in the middle. Great starter.
3. Crispy Squid - I also like this dish, as it's not as heavily battered and greasy. I don't particularly like the texture or taste of the green schug which is like a herby green hot sauce
4. Lamb Ribs - this is the highlight of the meal! Tender fall off the bones lamb, with a savoury sweet sauce. I don't normally like lamb but I feel I could eat plates of this.
5. Seared Cauliflower - enjoyable, but perhaps too heavy for my liking.. due to the duck fat and tahini sauce on it. 

It took a little while between the appetizers and the main to arrive.. not sure if there was a problem in the kitchen but fortunately our server checked in and he reassured us the food was on their way. Slight hiccup but understandable and forgivable.

To end it, we ordered Turkish Coffee and Turkish Coffee Chocolate Ice Cream. They brought out the ice cream with a single mini candle and I thought that was a nice touch.. shows that they were paying attention at the bookings. 
I thought the ice cream was more chocolatey than my liking, kinda hoping for more Turkish Coffee in it. My boyfriend really enjoyed his Turkish Coffee. Another highlight of the excellent service, he forgot to get it unsweetened but they offered to remake it even though it was our fault for not mentioning it. Anyway, it ended up being perfect just as is. 

It was a bit of a splurge, but we thought it was reasonable for the quality of food and service. I would definitely come back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

So incredibly. Best meal in years. nough said"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best dining experiences of my life.  And I live in NYC.  Ordered family style so we could try lots of stuff. Each dish was more delicious than the last.  App standouts:  baby artichokes, eggplant Kibbeh and Fig salad.  The cornish hen was the best out of all the mains we ordered (black cod and octopus where the others we tried).  Sides:  brussel sprouts were really good.  Fries were fine but not amazing and a big portion so you only need 1 order for 6 people.  For dessert, get the pomegranate sorbet.  The space itself is beautiful and service was friendly and attentive.  Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Fortunately a reservation cancelled and we were able to be seated.  Those silly people for not showing up for their dinner reservation.  This place was really good.  We ordered the steak tartare and eggplant wrapped with zucchini blossom as our apps.  Both were delicious.  The tartare had a little spice to it; but it was served with yogurt to cut the spice (if needed).  The eggplant/zucchini blossom fried perfectly.  Our entrees of lamb with rice, bronzino and a side of cauliflower with tahini were a hit.  We all agreed that the cauliflower (yes, cauliflower) was the hit surprise for all of us.  The bronzino was perfectly cooked with a chimichurri sauce and was deboned perfectly.  The Tah-Dig (lamb dish) was covered with basmati rice with a \"pseudo-sofritto.\"  The service was immaculate, friendly and prompt.  The restaurant has a chic vibe but is very laid back.  Great meal!!"}
{"text":"Great date night place! From appetizers, we tried roasted beets with their house made yogurt dip which was outstanding, spinache pide which tasted like pizza with a middle eastern twist, and Turkish dumpling which had amazing sauce but the dumpling themselves were quite disappointing as they lacked substance. The dumpling is supposed to be filled with eggplant but you can barely taste anything to be honest. The yogurt sauce was so rich and flavourful though. From the protein section we tried mussels which was tomato sauce based and bit too salty and had maybe ten mussles in total. We also had fried chicken which was overpowered with too much sesame seeds and funny aftertaste. The hot sauce was hot, use sparingly unless you enjoy habanero flavour. We also tried orange mousse dessert which was amazing. We were impressed with the airy fluffy pistachio cake and orange mousse on top that went well with side fruits. Overall great dishes that you can share with your company...the mains were disappointing but maybe other items are better. We were definitely impressed by all the other dishes we had otherwise."}
{"text":"This was an incredible dining experience in Toronto. I went with my hubby and in-laws and one of the first things my FIL said was that he was a little unsure of the menu bu it turns out he ate most of the food. Good sign.

The service was very attentive and warm. We ordered the tea service, which could be deadly as it is delicious with booze and turkish delight...the spanish octopus, yogurt fluke, roasted beets, and lamb ribs. It was the perfect amount of plates to share and they were all winners. My favorite was the fluke and we ordered more bread to dip it in the sauce. It was delicate and flaky filled with so much flavor. Still dreaming about that. For desserts we ordered these fragrant mini donuts and the ice cream sammies, they are called something else on the menu but the desserts pushed us over the edge...we should have just ordered one! 

Beautiful ambiance and were seated in front of the tile are prep kitchen...music was low and had a great energy through out our meal."}
{"text":"Byblos is one of the best restaurants in Toronto. Period. 

I've been here many times over the past couple of years and every single time have a wonderful experience. I've tried almost the whole menu, and highly recommend the beets labneh, lamb ribs, the pide, the ribeye and especially the slow braised lamb shoulder. 

Aside from the incredible food, the atmostphere and ambience are great. It's perfect for a date night, a girls night out, or even a family dinner. The staff are super knowledgeable and and on top of everything, always checking in on you and giving you the story behind Byblos and each dish. Truly top notch! 

Just make sure to make a reservation as they tend to book up weeks in advance!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal, fun for a group of 3 or more! For people who love to try different world foods"}
{"text":"Byblos is one of those perfect date spot or for a girl's night out!

The entrance is small and unassuming. The interior of the restaurant though modern and chic, I can almost say a little clubby.

Service is excellent. Our waiter is so knowledgeable and excited about the menu.

Cocktails to Start: 

Nightingale Sour ($14) - fruity and well balanced!
Cucumber & Mint Swizzle ($14) - so refreshing! A twist on Mojito!

Small Plates:

Lamb Ribs ($14) Dukkah + Buttermilk Sauce + Carob Molasses + Red Chili Schug
- Off the bone tender with right touch of spices. 

Crispy Eggplant ($12) Tahini Aioli + Bayildi Sauce + Basturma
- I found this dish so so. muted on taste
Rice Plates to Share:

Oxtail Basmati Rice ($22) Bing Cherries + Kale + Fried Shallots + House Yogurt
- Love the deep fried kale and the oxtail so soft and tender

Dessert to End: 

Saffron Semi Freddo ($8)

Everything was served beautifully with excellent plating. Love all the colourful elements a contrast to the white deco!

Byblos is a fun and interesting place to come with friends to share some small plate or with some one special for special occasions.

Price point though is on the $$$ side but it is downtown after all and not too many restaurants can dish out what they are serving with that much class as Byblos!"}
{"text":"The best food .... so delicious!! I wish we had one in Los Angeles! Delicious and fancy middle eastern food has much flavor and taste just amazing. My favorite were black truffle rice & kabab!! And there is so much more to try ...."}
{"text":"It was very difficult to not order everything on the menu! It's a beautiful restaurant with great service and amazingly delicious food! The Turkish dumplings were to die for. Also, make sure you leave some space for desserts because they were Michelin star worthy!"}
{"text":"The zucchini flower stuffed eggplant was out of this world, the truffle rice was super addictive...not to mention the lamb for two was so tender and flavourful. Service was impeccable and the waiter helped us sequence our dishes to enhance our dining experience."}
{"text":"Ordered Tuna Ceviche, Fig Salad, Crispy Squid, and lamb. Everything is very delicious, full of textures and flavors. All dishes have fusion touches. The service was great. The atmosphere is modern with classic elements. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a total noob when it comes to Mediterranean food, but I had a thoroughly enjoyable first experience at Byblos nonetheless. It's a really hip and cool restaurant located in the Entertainment District, with lots of candles and dim lighting on the inside. Staff there are super friendly and attentive, they come by a lot to fill up your water and clean off your table, and they are really good at giving you suggestions as to what to order. Each dish is pretty small is meant to be shared between your table, so they recommend that you order about 2 dishes per person - my group of 3 ordered 6 things:

Shakshouka (spicy tomato + yogurt + duck egg + romy cheese): This was an okay dish for me, but not my favourite. It mostly just tasted like tomato sauce/salsa, despite the other stuff in it i.e. yogurt, egg, cheese. People who like spicy food might be disappointed with this dish, because it's not spicy at all. Believe me, because I can't handle spice and even I didn't think it was spicy. An okay appetizer to start though, and comes with bread for dipping.

Crispy eggplant (with tahini aioli + bayildi sauce + basturma): Honestly I don't even know what all the different sauces were in this dish, but I really really liked it. The eggplant was kind of like fried in batter, kind of like tempura. Whatever the sauces were, they all mixed really well, and made this dish delicious, wonderful flavours.

Duck kibbeh (dried fig + date molasses + tahini): I love figs so was excited for this, but it wasn't a standout dish for me, not very memorable. I think the texture of the meat was maybe a bit dry but mostly fine, but it was a bit lacking in flavour.

Lamb ribs (dukkah + buttermilk sauce + carob molasses + red chili schug): Good dish, the sauces here create a very unique blend of flavours, very delicious and perfectly cooked and soft.

Seared cauliflower (duck fat + tahini sauce + sesame + coriander): I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this, because it seemed like such a basic dish. But there was this slightly cheesy flavour to the cauliflower that I really liked, and it was just super flavourful overall without being too salty.

Sweet jeweled basmati rice (carrot + saffron + barberries + almonds): Mmmmm sooooo so good. I loved this - the rice was so delicious and fragrant, and there were so many interesting flavours in here that made it unique. I loved the pomegranate seeds that were in here, which added a bit of tartness and crunch! Would highly recommend.

Unfortunately I didn't get to try any of their desserts, but I would definitely love to come back here and try some, because they sound so unique and delicious! It can get pricey depending on what you order, but when we split our bill it only ended up being about $30/person, and we were all pretty full. Awesome vibes at this place, and I would definitely recommend for a unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"On a random suggestion from another waiter on another night, we decided to try Byblos, who was blessedly close to our spot at the Festival Tower. After a day at Niagra-on-the-Lake and its wineries, you need a food spot that's stumbling distance. It was PACKED. So, make a reservation...or sit at the bar with a hot bartender serving you. Either way, you win. Try The Ten Suns cocktail (green tea infused vodka!!!), it was fantastic!!!

Service: Hot bartender, awesome service, the best management I've seen in a spot (and I'm hella picky, having been a bar manager or a DJ for 1/2 my life). The food order wasn't put in because, well, hottie was new and they were really busy. But, they didn't charge us, and the manager was incredibly apologetic. 

DJ: Yes, there's a DJ here, and he isn't too bad. We were here on a Saturday night, so he might not be there other nights. Had the perfect volume for each part of the night. 

Food: It was tasty. We ordered a bunch of plates and shared, and I was satisfied. Was it my fave in Toronto? No. But, since Toronto has an amazing food scene, that shouldn't scare you off. 

Drinks: SUPER tasty. As mentioned above, The Ten Suns will make you wanna boogie, feeling good, and persuade you to drink possibly more than you were planning. 

Overall: a great place to take co-workers or clients, or a date. I'd go here again, as long as it was on the company dime..it's a bit pricey, but that's to be expected in the area."}
{"text":"I love the look and feel of this place. Lounge style setting with long, low booths. Perfect for a luxurious meal. The decor is sumptuous. Beautiful elements of steel and glass. 
The host and wait staff are attentive without being overbearing. Sommelier recommended a great Spanish wine. One of the best Old Fashioned drinks in town, made with a Turkish bitter twist. 
Fatoush salad. So fresh. Turkish Manti Dumplings were a smokey delight: stuffed with eggplant and covered in a creamy yogurt sauce. We had the lamb as a main. More than enough to feed the three of us. So tender and savory, wrapped in flatbread with pickled beet slices, hot peppers, yogurt, pickle cucs. So deliciously decadent. Also had the beets in their homemade yogurt, which is to die for. 
Will return again and again."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and Amazing food and service, definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"Oh what food, I can go back here to have the slow cooked lamb and dear god trust me it was so soft it melted in my mouth. The food over all is very very good and unique, you need to know what to order. It's a Moroccan and European fusion food. I would go back any time."}
{"text":"We had the waiter pick arrange our meal - we let him do all the ordering - and we were not disappointed.  Great meal."}
{"text":"Hmmm so it looks like I didn't review this place when I went for the first time or second time, so I'll just combine both reviews into one for convenience's sake.

The first time my good friend and I came to this place (Nov 13, 2014), we were promptly greeted and seated on the main floor, with a good view of the prep tables. 

We started with the Fig salad with orange blossom honey vinegar, ackawi cheese, kohlrabi, and pistachio. I loved this. If I could eat this salad for the rest of my life, I would not have a single complaint. It's very light and I felt happy over eating something that felt so healthy. 

Afterwards we had the Lamb Ribs with dukkah, buttermilk sauce, carob molasses and red chili schug. We both never had lamb prepared like this, it was such an interesting combination, but we both really liked it. We had a side of organic house labneh which is fennel, honey, olive oil on barbari bread to go with the lamb. 

Then we shared the B.C. Mussels with maghreb couscous, basturma, pilpelchuma, and saffron. I loved how considerate the staff were, they placed an extra plate for us in case we wanted to put the shells elsewhere. It was a surprisingly filling dish. 

We also had the seared cauliflower with duck fat, tahini, sesame, and coriander. It was good. I don't remember anything specific about it by now though. 

Since this place was fairly new, they were testing out the coffee grinds to see how fine it should be for the Turkish coffee. They were courteous and humoured me as I approached the table and watched what was happening. Both my friend and I did not know how to drink Turkish coffee, so we swirled the coffee instead of letting the grounds settle to the bottom. Don't swirl it! 

All in all, this place was perfect. Excellent, warm and discrete service. Good lighting - it's dim enough to be romantic, while having enough light that you can see and examine what you're eating. We had a very lovely time. 

The second time I came here, my other friend and I had plans for the Die Walkure production at the Four Season's (Feb 4, 2015), so we couldn't enjoy the ambiance as much as we'd have liked. 

We started with the Steak Tartare with chilli paste, mint, yogurt, and olive Oil, with barbari bread. The steak tartare was delicious. A must-try, I cannot emphasize it more than that. My friend is lactose-intolerant, but even he couldn't resist trying the tartare with yogurt. 

Now if you're not very hungry, then I wouldn't suggest getting the 2-day slow braised Ontario lamb leg with pickles, sauces, and house lavash. Even our server didn't suggest it if we weren't hungry. But for me, that only made me want to prove him wrong! It was phenomenal, the meat was tender and fell off the bone. It had such a nice salt crust as well, I cannot heap more praises onto that lamb leg. Even now I remember it being one of the best pieces of meat I've had. And being able to wrap it in lavash with pickles and sauces to make mini shawarmas made it even more memorable. 

Oh and we had some green beans with tomato, fenugreek sauce, pickled garlic to go with our lamb. It was alright. The lamb overshadowed everything in my recollection. 

I am proud to say that our server was surprised that we were able to finish the entire plate. Well, more like me. My friend wiped out 3/4 of the way in, so I had to go at it for the both of us. Needless to say though, we didn't have the stomach space (or the time) to enjoy dessert - though I wish we did. Maybe next time. 

By now they've got their coffee grind to the perfect consistency!"}
{"text":"Great spot to get dinner before a show away from the hustle of King West.

The venue is more progressive than your standard Middle Eastern restaurant. The servers do an excellent job of explaining the shared meal concept of the restaurant and provide suggestions on how to structure your choices to get a good mix of the menu.

Unfortunately the size of the dishes can vary in size leaving you with too much or too little food. On the plus, the food is good quality with the Middle Eastern fried chicken being particularly good. 

There's also a varied selection of cocktails and wine. Overall you can expect to spend 140 plus tax and tip for 2 people having a couple drinks."}

{"text":"This was our first nicer dinner when we came to visit.  Guess we just got a slow start!

Everyone we encountered was very pleasant and accommodating. I was soon mesmerized by the way one of the chefs created the labneh \"well\" in the beet and crispy baby artichoke dishes. I eventually worked up the courage to ask his permission to take a Boomerang.  He kindly obliged.

To start, we ordered the beets, the steak tartare, manti dumplings and Spanish octopus. Though they pretty much put their dukkah on everything, it was delicious and I didn't mind it one bit.  The steak tartare and the octopus were my two favorite starters.  The steak tartare was one of the best I've had.

For the mains, we ordered the crispy duck confit rice, short rib kebab,  whole branzino along with a side of the seared cauliflower.  To be honest, we weren't HUGE fans of the entrees.  The appetizers were, to us, more impressive.  

Also, our server had mentioned she would course everything out for us so that not everything came at once.  But when ALL our entrees came at once and I commented to her, all she said was \"Yep, they're all here!\"

The crispy duck confit rice was pretty heavy on what tasted like star anise but I really enjoy the texture.  The short rib, for whatever reason, came lukewarm. I took food photos but I'm generally a one-and-done type photographer (not high caliber) so it doesn't explain why the short rib was already lukewarm by the time we dug in.  The fish was ok...somewhat on the fishy side...but the saffron sauce which I was apprehensive about ended up saving the dish.

Dessert was another highlight of the evening.  The pavlova was a foregone conclusion due to the theatrics of cracking it open but it ended up being supremely tasty as well.  First meringue I've had that was tangy and not cloyingly sweet.  We also got the baklava which we had totally discounted thinking it was heavy. On recommendation from our server, though, we decided to give it a go.  It was amazingly light and delicious as well.

Overall a good meal...and I would probably come back if we were ever in town again (hopefully)...but I would probably cobble together dinner from among the appetizer section or try other entrees."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great drinks, and service. Casual but a bit upscale -- nice ambiance (bar area upstairs less quiet and refined than downstairs).  Everyone clearly takes pride in their quality of service and product. I highly recommend. Bartender Robin earns a special shout out."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite \"fancy\" restaurant in Toronto. Although on the expensive side, every dollar is worth it as the ingredients they use are incredibly fresh and top notch, the presentation of the food is amazing and the service is also great. 

It's a great restaurant for date night or for a fancy dinner with a group of friends because it's easier to get many dishes and share. 

A true gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday celebration dinner, arrange by my partner and it was just me and him. Food was great and service was attentive.

When it came to picking a dinner place before the Beyonce concert, Byblos came to mind after Figo and Pai could not be booked via open table. So happens today. I needed to bump up the reservation by one person, just one person, so I phoned the reservation hotline.

\"Maria\" or whoever was manning the reservation line was so crass. After I explained our situation, she was un-sympathetic and was \"i can assign you to our 8:45 sitting and that's it\". Explained to her that timing was inflexible due to the concert and she goes \"i can't do anything\".

Trying to understand how Byblos does their reservation sitting, after Maria mentioned that tables haven't been assigned yet, at this point I was curious...if tables haven't been assigned how can you not accommodate an additional person? And so Maria spills... apparently Byblos has pre-assigned our group of 5 to a table of 4. Weird, right? Why would a restaurant, consciously squeeze a group into a smaller table, that is one less the original size of the reservation? That doesn't leave space for any flexibility. I was trying to get Maria to re-consider our situation. But I guess she thought she has the power to call the shots upholding her \"i am the reservation goddess\" attitude. 

At this point I have given up on the reservation goddess and Byblos. Yes Byblos is ONE OF the nicer restaurants in Toronto, with emphasis on the being \"one of many\". If Byblos does not take care of this customer facing side of the  business or the way they manage their sitting sitting arrangements , large foodie groups like mine would be happy to bring our $$$ elsewhere. 

In this day and age where the longevity of a restaurant rests not only on the food by the whole dining experience, Byblos has room to improve."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals in a while! Was taken here by a lover and had absolutely no expectations. When I first entered Byblos I was endeared by their lovely decor and ambience, you could tell that great thought was put into the design, flow and layout of this place. 

The place fills up real quick during the nights and the night I came had many tables reserved. 

The food portions are adequate and fills you up without leaving too heavy of an after taste. The flavor pairings of the dishes were very well though out beginning with waitress' recommendation of fig salad; the herbs and leafs in this was so fresh I almost felt like I was eating it straight from the plant. The sauces and seasoning was so eloquently used that everything balanced out so well, not ashamed to say that I quickly chowed down the entire plate in mere seconds. 

Next I had the crispy squid, similar to calamari but a little lighter and smaller tentacles. Also had the steak tartare paired with greek yogurt (they call it labneh) which melted in your mouth, albeit being a little plain. The lamb rib felt a little stingy; each bone was probably one bite-size, nothing special.

Probably the best dish tonight was the oxtail basmati rice, a little on the heavy size, it was aromatic, creamy and rich. The flavour of the oxtail was imbued into each scoop of the yellow golden rice, while the kale offered a variation in texture with every mouthful. This I am definitely coming back for.

To finish had the chocolate mousse and burnt honey ice cream. Mousse was typical, but the ice cream was interesting - I actually don't know how they got that flavour so on point! Must try (and it's only $3).

An amazing discovery I had tonight was \"dukkah\": crushed hazelnuts, coriander seeds, sesame seeds, cumin. The texture and aroma of this garnish is addictive, and Byblos isn't afraid to abuse their dukkah. I left craving for more, and now I'm in the search for making some at home."}
{"text":"Wooooww....!
I don't now where I should  start.Decoration or food.Both of them AAA.Don't miss this business,If you are in Toronto.Kitchen will guide  you trip to cost of Mediterranean countries food."}
{"text":"Greek food done tapas style. There are a lot of influences from Armenian food and Lebanese food included in the dishes they serve and everything was delish! 
The resto is on two floors. Decor is great and they serve the food on the most adorable unique plates."}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of a friend that had previously visited the city. The atmosphere was great and the food did not disappoint. The craft cocktail was delicious, but the kind that has a lot going on that makes you crave something simple afterward.  

My biggest piece of advice is about menu structure. It's broken up into different categories like starters, mains,  salads,  sides, etc. If I were to go back again, I would order one starter, two mains, and one side to split between two people. The server kept trying to talk us into more and more food and kept calling the selections we made a \"very light\"  meal, and describing all of the portions as much smaller than they actually were. Yes, don't go in expecting everything to be super-sized, but two plates per person was more than enough food, and I left feeling overly stuffed from our \"light meal.\" 

Between my partner and I, we ordered an olive starter, beet labneh, the black cod and Turkish dumpling mains, and the crispy cauliflower and Brussels sprouts as sides. Everything was very very good. My biggest critique is that the cauliflower incorporated duck fat and I just wasn't expecting a meat-like flavor with my cauliflower. I'm sure some people would enjoy it, but I wouldn't get it again. Everything else was delicious.  

All in all,  a great experience. Good drinks, good food and good atmosphere. Just keep an eye out for servers trying to convince you to order more and more food!"}
{"text":"Great food, love love love the atmosphere, amazing service as well. A great date place ;)"}
{"text":"When we called for a reservation, they were fully booked but the hostess suggested that we come in anyways as they might have cancellations and if not, we could always get a seat upstairs at the bar as it also served the full dinner menu. The restaurant has two floors - the first having a more bright, upbeat  and clean cut feel and the second floor with a more dark, underground club, eclectic feel. We were seated at the far end of the bar which was perfect since it gave me a view of the entire scene during the night. 

The bartender was extremely friendly and passionate about the items on the menu. He was able to fully educate us on each dish and checked on us fairly regularly during our meal. The food here was great. I loved the tuna ceviche and roasted red beets. The only item I was a little iffy on was the Turkish Manti Dumplings - they did not have much in terms of filling and I found the dumpling skins to be a little hard (maybe because we left it for a while before eating). I would highly recommend the Yogurt Mousse - very light and yummy... and I loved the Persian cotton candy on top!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Would definitely come back for a date or special occasion. 

I LOVE figs so we tried the fig salad and the tah dig. Everything else we ordered was also amazing:  Lamb ribs, Turkish mantis dumplings, and the black truffle wood fired starter."}
{"text":"Loved this place.. It's mediterranean with a twist, and loved the portion sizes, because the experience is meant to be sharing of dishes, it allowed us to taste more of the great menu that they have.. The atmosphere and interior are amazing as well.."}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonable price

Things to get:
- Their mussels
- One of those rice dish 
- Lamb Ribs

Don't get:
- Seared Cauliflower"}
{"text":"Worth a visit.  Not everything is fantastic/authentic but enough of it is to warrant 5 stars.  Also I had one of the single best bites of my life here.  The slow roasted lamb shoulder is fantastic.  Great braise and flavor on the lamb, it was also Ontario-raised - I had never had Canadian lamb before but it was good.  They serve the lamb with several accoutrements - actually it's much like a shawarma, but the classiest, most expensive shawarma ever.  They bring you homemade lavash with several pickles, chili peppers, and garlic sauce.  You wrap the lamb in the lavash with some garlic and pickles - wow.  Not cheap but ok for special occasions."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in Toronto! My fiance and I went to Greece, Santorini a couple of years ago and were amazed how great the food was there and struggled to replicate the experience upon our return to Toronto until we came across Byblos. We've been there 3 times so far, and tried a variety of dishes and all were hands down AMAZING. The ambiance is sophisticated, the service is top notch. The place suits all types of occasions. I guarantee after you go there you will keep craving this food all the time. AMAZING! One of the best restaurants in town for sure."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! All the dishes we tried were so good! We got the lamb and it was unreal and good drink menu. If you're looking for a new place to have a special dinner or just feel like switching it up I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service. They do have $20 valet parking in case you come at a Friday busy night and all the parking a around are full. The service is really good, from the outside gate to inside door until you sit. 

The waiter gentleman asked us if this was our first time there, then he quickly introduced the menu (left side was first course and right side was second course etc) since I was living in Turkey for half year before so I was very familiar with the food on the menu. But if you are not familiar with the food, they were very patient to explain in details (I overheard they introduced Turkish coffee to the table besides mine) 

I ordered Spinach pide as first course, the portion is not too big for an \"appetizer\", and the sour cream on the spinach with the softness of spinach + crispy bread, made a perfection! 

I then ordered BC mussels. The highlight is the sauce with couscous! I so regret that I didn't order rice because that would be awesome to pour that sauce into my rice... Haha

Lastly I ordered lamb rack! Again, the sauce, the sauce is totally a highlight for this dish! The lamb is delicious!! 

All in all, it's a great experience. Next time I'll try the fish, and dessert :)"}
{"text":"I went here a couple months back for my birthday and everything about this restaurant exceeded my expectations. I had heard good things about the food and service before going and was excited to finally try Byblos. At the end of the meal my friends and I agreed that the food was amazingly good and we would not hesitate to go back again.

For a party of 5 we ordered these items:
- Organic house labneh - This was amazing. I would go back for more of this and lick the plate clean if I could. It's that good!
- Lamb ribs - I am not a fan of lamb but I tried this plate since others wanted to get it. I hardly tasted any of that lamb aftertaste and the spice/seasoning worked very well with the meat. 
- We also ordered a salad  but I don't quite remember what it was called. 
- Turkish Manti Dumplings - Didn't find this dish anything special. Thought the dumpling wrapper was too thick (maybe it's suppoed to be like that though...? I'm not sure)
- Chargrilled Cornish Hen - Hen was moist and very tender
- Sweet jeweled basmati rice - Rice is a staple item in my diet and I have tried many different types of rice but this particular rice dish just blew me away. The unique flavours of the different components of the rice worked very well together to create a dish that was different and so full of flavour. It was also beautifully presented!
- We ordered 2-3 desserts including their housemade ice creams and sorbets...you can't leave without trying these!!


I can say without a doubt that Byblos has amazing food, service, and a trendy atmosphere. Perfect place for a date or to celebrate a special occasion with a group of friends. I would go back in an instant to try more of their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Out of all the many restaurants we went to in Toronto, Byblos was the very best! Here's why:

1) The food: They take Mediterranean cuisine and up the game creating a magical dining experience. Truly, every dish is amazing, but I recommend these: The black truffle pide (flat bread), manti dumplings (if you love cream sauce), fig salad, and the roasted brussels sprouts. 

2) The cocktails: Their menu is Mediterranean inspired and provides very unique cocktails with untraditional ingredients. Order one, or two.

3) The location: It's downtown Toronto.

4) The atmosphere: It's well decorated and unique.

5) The prices: For one of the best restaurants in town, it's affordable!

If you don't have it on your itinerary, add it ASAP. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The same week end we experienced byblos we had been to one of those rip-off \" best brunch in town\" place where \"everybody\" runs to. 
As am arrogant french prick I was starting to have serious doubts on my Torontonians friends palate!
But then, thanks to Yelp, we found Byblos!!!
Maybe the best place i ever ate in Toronto!!!
As simple as that.
I cant wait to return!!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Byblos is its decor and atmosphere. Such a cute place to have a date. Our waiter was really friendly and helpful. That being said, the food was good but pricey. Some dishes were a hit and others were a miss. I'm not sure if I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Byblos. Still one of my fave restaurants in the city for food and ambience! Everything on their menu is delicious and their prices are reasonable. The decor is pretty and the service is fantastic. I have never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews about this place, I thought I would go check it out! We were seated at the bar upstairs as we had no reservation and welcomed immediately by the bartenders.

We ordered: 

Duck Kibbeh - delicious and similar to an Indian pakora 
Lamb ribs - crunchy texture, these were okay but did not like that it was gamey 
Cheese acharuli - wonderful and put together dish
Crispy eggplant - delicious, however it comes with a cured beef (basturba) which we did not know about until after the dish arrived 
Turkish Manti Dumplings - highly recommended, this dish was the highlight of the night 

For dessert: 

Crispy Qatayef 
Yogurt Mousse 
Both of these delicious are definitely worth a try! 

All together the service and food was amazing. I will be returning, perhaps this time with reservations. 

Reservation tip: Sit downstairs in the dining area to see the preparation process for dishes."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while and finally decided we should give it a try for our anniversary dinner. I made our reservation well in advance and showed up prompt at 6:30pm. Although it was a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who led us to our table on the 2nd floor. Our table was located against a grey leather banquet in the left corner. I think this had to be the best table on that level as it was far enough away from the  other 2 adjacent tables and we had the whole corner to ourselves which gave us a great view of the entire floor.

The menu here is predominantly mediterranean and served tapas style meant for sharing. Our waiter was really attentive all night long and each dish came out in a timely manner giving us plenty of time to enjoy one before the next course arrived. I also really enjoyed how the waiter would describe everything on plate as they delivered it to us.

We started off with the Fig Salad which has to be one of the best salad i've ever had! It was so fresh with bright citrus flavours. I loved the crunch from the roasted pistachios, and the creamy salty bits of Ackawi cheese which was a nice contrast against the sweet figs. There were also notes of cardamom in the salad which was surprising to taste yet it complimented the dish so well.

Next came the Lamb Ribs. I absolutely love lamb but have never had the ribs before and these were exquisite! The meat was soo tender, juicy, and flavourful and I adored the contrast of crunchy salty coating.

For mains we had to have the Daily Chargrilled Fish which happened to be Red Snapper. The presentation of the snapper was really breath taking. The fish came out whole with head and tail and was nicely deboned. The fish was covered in mixture of herbs and pickled cucumbers with charred lemons on the side. This fish itself was really moist and the abundant coating of herbs gave the sweet flesh another subtle dimension of fresh flavour. 

For rice we went with the Oxtail Basmati Rice. I loved that the rice was topped with the crunchy fried kale and the chunks of oxtail mixed in was so tender and flavourful. Make sure you give this rice a good mix before serving so you get a little bit of everything mixed in.

For a side we chose the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Halloumi cheese. Again such a unique combination of flavours. The crispy halloumi paired so well with the roasted brussel sprouts drizzled with the creamy yogurt sauce we couldn't get enough of them!

Although I was stuffed at this point I couldn't resist trying some some there enticing desserts.

The Chocolate Mousse was soo creamy and light and not too sweet. I loved the bits of broken baklava to add some crunch and spots of chocolate sauce on plate to intensify the chocolate flavour.

Burnt Honey Ice cream had a wonderful roasted honey flavourful with notes of vanilla and topped with a wedge of sponge toffee on top.

Turkish Coffee Ice cream was soo creamy and rich with a chocolate base and notes coffee in the background topped with chocolate shavings

Finally I had a Moroccan Mint Tea to wash it all down which had a mild mint flavour served in glass tumbler piping hot with mint leaves floating on top was the perfect way to end a glorious meal.

I can totally see why people are flocking here. This meal will definitely go down in one of my top 10 most memorable meals! The service here is top notch and the flavours are so unique and amazing. Everything is presented so beautifully and plated with care. The servers know what there doing and they play 80s music in the background. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Food ****1/2
Service ****
Ambience *****

What can I say?  After wanting to go for more than a year, we stumbled upon an open reservation on a snowy Friday night.   I'm very happy that Pai (thai restaurant up the street) was so busy!

Labneh / Red Beets
Halloumi (sp?)
Roasted Brussel Sprouts
Slow Braised Lamb (main dish Byblos is known for)
Mejadra Rice

Everything was fantastic.   Notable things that really stood out were the lamb and the Labneh+Beets.  The lamb was perfectly braised, and when combining it with the condiments and wrap may have been one of the best things I've ever tasted!  The Labneh was also incredible.  The olive oil (i assume greek) in the middle is very smooth, and the Barbari bread is so flavourful.

Tip:  If you can sit upstairs, do it.  Both areas are great, but the upstairs with the high ceilings, low chairs and warm lighting is perfect for a fun evening dinner."}
