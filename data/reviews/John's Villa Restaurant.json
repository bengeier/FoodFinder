{"text":"The food here is delicious! The environment Is cozy and the employees treat us like family. I love this place! It is hidden but worth the find! Thx"}
{"text":"Sad to say, I give only a single star and that is to acknowledge the fact they have been here for maybe 40 years.  The food is what I would call minimalist.  It is just good enough to not be called terrible, the prices are cheap, cheap, cheap but then you get what you pay for.  This place reminds me of the little downtown cafes I frequented as a kid back in Kansas, when I did not know any better and could not afford to eat decently.  Going to a Village Inn would be a huge step up in quality.  'Nough said!"}
{"text":"Hidden away in the retirement community of Dreamland Villa is this cute little restaurant.  You will find a crowd of regular morning snowbirds in for the tasty homemade breakfasts and good coffee with decent prices and service with a smile. They also are famous for their fish fry which has been extended to include Wednesdays along with Fridays.  The restaurant is open for breakfast and lunch only and is closed on Saturdays (kind of quirky)."}
