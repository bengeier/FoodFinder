{"text":"great friendly service, portions are huge and so tasty! roties are my favourite! everything on their menu is well worth a try! great spot here in the Pointe"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place !!

Growing up in a Jamaican household with a mother that loved to cook, my standard for Caribbean food is set really high.
I've been scouring this city for the last 2 years for a restaurant that makes my heart  sing and I have finally found it !!
The food is well seasoned, they give generous portions and the staff is friendly

The only thing I would say is that their rice is dry...this can be easily fixed by asking for extra gravy

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I seem to be on a mission to try out all the off the beaten path establishments in Montr√©al. Boom J's has mostly takeout and delivery service, but my friend just moved to the area, so I tried it for a second time.

The menu is extensive with the traditional offerings, from the jerk plates, to rotis, to patties. All are worthy of the trek out to the Pointe to get them. I had a chicken patty, as they were all out of beef. It was the right kind of spicy, and I ate it while we waited for our takeout plates to be ready. The guy behind the counter was very funny, and really made the experience memorable.

The small jerk chicken plate comes with a generous helping of legs and pieces dripping in the tangy, hot jerk sauce. A little side salad with dressing on the side, plantains and a mountain of rice and peas. My dining companion wasn't able to finish hers, so she gets a second helping tomorrow. I'm guessing that the large plate could easily feed two people with a couple of patties.

There are an abundance of Caribbean places scattered around the city. I'm on a mission to try them all!"}
{"text":"Great taste amazing portion. Went there with my 3 kids. They all loved it. The kids hadtge fried chicken and went crazy for it. I had the jerk chocken. Aldo like the signed saidbest jamaican patties in montreal"}
{"text":"So \"F\"ing good! Ordered from here multiple times. Never had a problem. The delivery guy was adorable and the food.....well let's just say I order enough that I have leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the delivery time is the worst like get more or Get another drivers"}
{"text":"Those beef patties, damnnnnnn 
Spicy and tasty and beef is so moist and makes you drool for days"}
{"text":"Wow! If I can give 0 stars, I would. This restaurant is absolutely horrible. I ordered delivery from them and as I am from out of town and live in a condo building, I requested that they call me at the lobby. But, apparently they don't even know how to dial a long distance number as they couldn't reach me because they didn't put a 1 in front of my number before dialling. When I called the restaurant, they didn't pick up but the 5th time they did saying that they couldn't do anything because their restaurant was now closed. Wasted a hour and half of my life and I waited in the lobby for 40 minutes for them. Do you really want your food to be made by someone who's too stupid to know that you should put a 1 in front of a long distance number? Horrible service. Didn't even apologize. Don't know how to dial a phone number or pick up their phones."}
{"text":"Ate there last week and decided to order for delivery tonight since the food was so good. I ordered the large beef stew, it was delicious, but had only one little piece of meat the size of a quarter and the rest was potatoes. I finished my meal, pissed, looking at my roommate eating his big portion of chicken. You guys suck!"}
{"text":"Less than average Jamaican food but especially horrible service. Don't order and don't make your way there. Last order (a simple chicken roti) took more than two hours to arrive, roti was tiny and not that good.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good!!!! Got the goat curry roti, good, the oxtail, good, and the jerk chicken, good!! Portions were huge! Delivery is a little slow so just make sure you place your order earlier! This place is going to be a regular in our household."}
{"text":"Food is great. But WTF is with the portions? I ordered a large jerk chicken plate 17.50 with delivery plus tip for the driver and got two little pieces of chicken and more than 1 KG of rice? Wtf? I don't like feeling ripped off but damn seriously?"}
{"text":"I got the small jerk chicken plate. The portion was generous and the chicken was good although lacking in spiciness. However the rice is more than subpar. It had a pasty texture to it that want very appetizing. The salad, which was more of a slaw, was ok. They need to step up their side games."}
{"text":"My eyes are fixated, my mouth dribbles, my nose is intoxicated by the fragrant concoction of what is being prepared in the kitchen!

The stove, the grill and the oven are all fired up. The room fills up with a mix of char grill smoke and a magical aroma and makes your imagination run wild and makes you want to order everything that is on the menu!

Jamaican cuisine is an adventure for the palate due  to the blend of spices and herbs used in cooking such as scallions, ginger, thyme, garlic, cinnamon, peppercorns, nutmeg, pimento and hot peppers. Not exactly like what you would get in Jamaica but Boom J does a preeeeetty decent job bringing us a piece of \"paradise\" to Montreal tantalizing your taste bud while appeasing your eyes.

Here you can find truly authentic Jamaican staples such as Jerk Chicken, BBQ Chicken, Chicken Wings, Pineapple Chicken, Curried Goat, Shrimp Curry, Oxtail, Variety of Roti, King Fish, Red Snapper, Ackee and Salt Fish, savoury Jamaican Patties, Coco bread, pretty much all your can dream of. Yeah, I did try everything but am partial to Curried Goat Roti and the Oxtail - deeelish!

All plates are available in small (which is actually regular) or large size, and come with rice (white or with beans), salad, and plantain. If it's your first time, ease in with the $6 lunch special where you can try one of their styles of chicken and some rice. Oh here's a secret... ask for the extra-flavourful and spicy sauce made with Scotch Bonnet peppers, it's worth it - promise! Just go easy cuz it's hot!

Boom J, is a true family affair, where you will find mom, dad, brother, sister-in-law and so many more I can't keep count in the kitchen or at the counter waiting for you to make your mind as you scan through the vast menu. 

Which reminds me of a great Jamaican saying and song \"No man is and island, no man is alone...\" meaning no person can do it all by themselves, life depends on all things and beings working together and it's so true here.

Yah Mon! Mi nuh hav nutten fi complain bout, everything eez alright. Respect! One Love!"}
{"text":"I loved the oxtail!  Cooked to perfection so a 5/5!  I slathered on some pepper sauce and it was delicious!  

The curry goat was also quite flavourful but not all the pieces were 100% tender.  I'd give this a 4/5 and would still order this again.  

To my surprise, I found the jerk chicken a tad on the salty side and some pieces were overly charred...3/5.  

The sides were great!  The coleslaw had a nice tang and who doesn't enjoy plantain?  

Nothing beats friendly service with a smile!!"}
{"text":"The delivery guy seemed drunk and uncoordinated once he arrived. He also showed up 1 1/2 hour late. He didn't have his debit machine because his battery died. I told him I only had $5 in cash and he asked me to give it to him as a tip before I even paid for my meal (I had to do it over the phone). 
I ordered the jerk chicken and curry shrimp. The food was alright, but there was very little chicken in our order and mostly bones and cartilage. We also didn't get the fries we ordered.
Unfortunately, based on my experience, I don't think I'll order from here again :/"}
{"text":"Pass by here yesterday to grab a jerk chicken roti which used to be my favourite,  read my previous review.
The one I got yesterday was way smaller and the filling didn't hold up, it looked like a  soup, with some pieces of bones, impossible to eat like a sandwich which was the case for the last 10+ visits I had come here over a year ago.
I hope this was a one off but reading recent reviews on Google Maps it seems to be their new normal.
Sad to see it go down."}
{"text":"Super duper good Caribbean food. Great price in general, but especially on lunch specials. I had the jerk chicken wrap which was awesome. They've got more traditional stuff like oxtail and goat curry, which I can't wait to go back and try.

The restaurant is kind of hole-in-the-wall, so I'd recommend doing take-out. Actually, there's a great park nearby - the Marguerite-Bourgeoys. Also, if you happen to be visiting the Maison Saint-Gabriel, this would be a perfect lunch stop.

Service was great! Go Boom J!"}
{"text":"Being from a Carribean background I know that most places lack customer service and if the place has good customer service normally the food isn't so good.This place has the best balance that Ive witnessed in the city.Their lunch specials are very inexpensive and it has probably the best jerk chicken in the city"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Caribbean food then Boom J's is worth a try. 

The curried chicken was great.  Very tasty and juicy.  I got the large order and it was huge. 

I also had a side of jerk chicken and for my taste it was just ok.  
On the plus side, it was also juicy and tender.  With a nice char flavour from the grill and a light sweetness. 
What it was missing was any flavour of jerk.  I'm looking for allspice and thyme and there was none detectable.   Almost as if it was brined in a sugar solution then grilled.   Not my favorite. 

There was a generous load of rice & peas as well."}
{"text":"I don't know why i did this to myself when the food in Montreal so far has been lackluster (bland, small portions, etc). I have eaten almost every type of jamaican food. I've dated jamaican women. I know how to cook jamaican food. I lived next door to a jamaican restaurant, in a predominately jamaican community for 3 years. If you're from New York ,Toronto, Jamaica or pretty much any city with a large Jamaican culture, do not expect much from this place. Ordered a \"large\" (4 pieces of chicken) jerk chicken with rice/peas and a beef patty. Worst beef patty ever. The outer layer was hard/crunchy. I broke it off, threw it in the garbage, and only ate the inner part. The inner part was tender but the taste was off. It was basically cheap beef paste. The actual jerk chicken, at first glance, looked good. It looked glazed and i figured \"interesting\" until I peeped that was the \"jerk sauce\". The \"jerk sauce\" is basically a tan/light brown sauce with beans. The same type of sauce Dominicans make with arroz con pollo. I kid you not. Google \"Peppas Jerk Chicken\" in NY and you'll see how jerk sauce is supposed to look like. It is supposed to be ROBUST pimento (and BBQ flavor) sauce. Folk in montreal are getting PLAYED so badly.  The chicken itself tasted like regular charred grilled chicken. I actually seasoned it further and grilled it a big more @ home. I'm done with the food in this city. These montreal folk don't know good food. I think if they actually ate authentic jamaican food in Kingston they would orgasm uncontrollably or possibly implode."}
{"text":"This is good food! I loved the chicken and super good rice. Have been back many times and the quality is consistent. The owner/operator is a good guy who cares about his business and the quality of food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is very good. They make your chicken in the smoker when you order so you have to wait for it to be done before eating. 

May take up to 30min and that's why I don't give 5 stars. 

When it arrive it's totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Haven't had a lot of jerk chicken but this place is definitely delicious and worth trying!

The smell of the chicken is  blooming even before you enter the little restaurant. As soon as you open the door, the smoked bbq chicken immediately waters your mouth.

You know the food is good even before tasting it from the smell. I told the employe behind the counter and that it was my first time. He recommended the jerk chicken so that's what I took.

Although the good had cool down a bit by the time I arrived home, the food was still amazing!

Chicken was smoky and sweet with a hint of spicyness. The meat was really juicy and tender. It came with a side of rice, salad and plantain. Everything was delicious.

Also took a chicken Jamaican patty. They claim it was the best in town, but it was just alright.

This joint definitely is worth trying. Will be back again to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"J'ai command√© la bouffe avec eux √† partir de Just-Eat. Apr√®s deux heures d'attente, je n'ai rien re√ßu. Finalement, un employ√© du resto m'a appel√© pour dire qu'ils annulent ma commande, parce qu'ils n'ont aucun chauffeur de livraison! Incroyable!!!!!!!! Ils n'ont aucun respect pour le client√®le. Just-Eat m'a donn√© on coupon de 15$ pour la mauvaise exp√©rience."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this place this afternoon. I heard a lot of buzz from people from work about this place so I decided to take a walk and try it. The place is really small and has a few chairs to dine in but it seems the majority of the people do take out. There menu has all the great Caribbean cuisine from jerk chicken to ox tail and patties for a hand held lunch. 


I took the small lunch portion of jerk chicken. It came with rice and beans and a pickled salad. I think that's what it was. Was delicious. The jerk rub is very flavourful just wish it had more heat to it. Still the  best jerk I tried in Montreal. I also had a beef patty, the inside lacked some flavour and the pastry was too soft for me. The service was pretty slow considering there was 2 people in front of me, but I would definitely try it again, maybe the ox tail. Heard it's fall of the one tender. :)"}
{"text":"Cancel whatever lunch or dinner plans you have. Done? Good. Now, walk, bike or drive to Boom J's and treat yourself to the best roti you've ever tasted. No, seriously. There's a 99% chance this will be the best roti you've ever tasted. And if it's not, you're either incredibly lucky (please tell me your roti spot) or a liar. 

I got the jerk chicken roti, but everything on the menu looks incredible. That said, the jerk chicken is amaaaaaaazing. I don't know how to describe the flavour besides \"perfection.\" And it's incredibly well priced! $9.50 for a massive portion of food. 

Finally, the people running the shop are absolutely delightful, so add another star for that. 

This place is a gem. I can already tell that I'll be spending a lot of time there."}
{"text":"I'm so happy there's finally a decent Caribbean take-out in my hood!

Came here a few weeks ago after dinner buddy told me there's a new Jamaican take-out in the area and it's been getting great reviews on urbanspoon and just-eat.ca.
It serves all the usual suspects that you'll find at any Caribbean eatery, goat curry, roti, jerk chicken, fried chicken, oxtail stew, beef patties, fried plantains, ackee fish. I also noticed some other items I haven't seen anywhere else like pineapple chicken, red snapper, and kingfish.

They really do pile on the carbs, lots of rice and peas and some fried plantains and simple iceberg lettuce salad. My friend had the jerk chicken and I had the oxtail stew. She loved her dish and my oxtail was so moist and tender, it was falling off the bone.
There are hardly any seats here, not a lot of people stay and sit but they do brisk take-out and delivery business.

This is a great place to know about especially on those ultra-cold, blizzard days in January and February when you're craving something warm and spicy and you don't want to venture outside, but would rather stay cozy at home. Just order in and you're set."}
