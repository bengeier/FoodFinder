{"text":"I really don't understand the hype about this place under the new management.  The food is really blah.  Really really blah.  Went for brunch once and it was just greasy and icky.  Love the original decor with all it's rustic charm, but the food was a non-starter.  And they don't serve poutine anymore!!!  Seriously, what is a diner without poutine?!?!  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Overpriced place. I dont know were to start..  the staff look nice at first but are not really, when you ask them about their german or swedish dishes they get rude and impatient?? it takes ALOT of time for the food to be ready, plan to be there at least for 1h30mins!! anyways the food is okay but 18$ for a burger not really worth it. second time a ordered a \"pizza\" wich was 6\" x 3\" tomatoes and cheese for 21$? expected way more than a regular pizza! and dont expect proper customer service at all"}
{"text":"that was the worst and tiniest poutine i have ever had! and the most expensive. i remember this awesome place back in the day things have sure changed there since the 90s."}
{"text":"Quite a nice find. Rocking an old school diner atmosphere, yet the food is anything but -- much better! I had a porkchop garnished with peaches (peaches!), and these amazing green beans. Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Great expectations from this neighborhood diner and unfortunately left very disappointed. Went solo to experience their Valentine's Day Sausage Specials for my first visit and will NOT be returning anytime soon! Both price and service were unacceptable, as I tried their sausage \"platter\", not once but twice(!) just to make sure, and did not feel I got my money's value. For $15.95, a grilled sausage in a poppyseed bun with shoestring fries, hmmmm, over-priced did you say?? And asked for salad on the second platter and of course got fries once again. Shrugs from wait staff, apologies and maybe next time. As I said, not impressed. Place does get busy, standing room only by the time I left, the four bar seats surrounded by at least 10 folks waiting for seats. $50 total for 2 hot dogs, fries and a beer, all in. Done....."}
{"text":"Very good service but very inconsistent half the menu is great and half is awful. Order the burger, it's great. The Mac and cheese is good. The fried chicken is good. The fish is frozen salmon, overcooked for 22$ with two gross, flavorless cauliflower florets on the side. Man that makes me angry. The steak is no good either. The Greek salad is a joke. Stick to the cheapies, they're very good."}
{"text":"Nouveau Palais makes so much sense. I like to come here mainly for the relaxed vibe, the drinks and the good music. The menu doesn't reinvent the wheel but it does simple foods weirdly well. I once had mussels and shoestring fries that were perfectly fine. It's cozy and comfortable and always fun to people-watch on a Friday night: pretty young things on their way to a neighbourhood party, mingling with those old-time customers from when this place was still a greasy spoon that served poutine. Ah Mile End."}
{"text":"So I had a terrible experience here and even though there are a lot of great posts I am going to letcha all know! Anyway, so I came in after a super long bike ride and really just wanted something delicious... I ordered the greek salad for take-out and brought my little paper bag down the street to my place. When I brought it out in my kitchen my roomies (two of which are servers) exclaimed, \"what the eff is that?\", \"where did you get that?\", \"how much did you pay for that?\" etc.... Needless to say, it was very underwhelming and when I brought it back (after much coaxing from the roomies) the server (owner?) was extremely rude. Honestly, this is the only time I've ever returned food... but there it is..."}
{"text":"Very over-priced and the owner is a bit of a dick. Overall, definitely not worth it. The spaetzel is pretty good though."}
{"text":"I never had the opportunity to go to the original Nouveau Palais but I absolutely love the revamped diner now under new ownership.  I've been frequenting this spot for almost a year now and really enjoy their delicious fare, especially their burger!  It's a mix and twist on classic diner food, often with unexpected menu additions.  It's also a go-to spot for coffee and a slice of incredible sweet potato pie, or for a late-night drink  and cheesy fries with friends.  You've got to try Jacques cocktails!"}
{"text":"Since I wrote my first review, I went back FOUR TIMES in 3 weeks.   This place is like heroin. I don't know what the hell is going there (mind control, drugs in the food) but I can't stop thinking about it and dragging everyone I know there. So far I've tried the Autumn Spazzle, burger, Hunter's Chicken, and flapjacks with caramelized bananas. Holy shit - amazing."}
{"text":"While I've reviewed Nouveau Palais in the past for Nightlife Magazine - http://bit.ly/oUpqnb, I recently returned to the neo-vintage resto, and as always, I only have good things to say about the food and the people. In the spirit of mixing things up and keeping it fresh, the special for the night was this sort of stringy mushroom, fried, accompanied by a killer sauce. For anyone with a sweet tooth, it looks like a summer treat at Nouveau Palais is a home-made ice cream sandwich exploding with black cherries. As per usual, the staff was super friendly, and they gave us a dining experience full of heart. And fear not, the stuffed fox is still keeping watch over all patrons."}
{"text":"diner style. New owner and chef making good food. Menu stays fresh(variations made monthly). Open Late. Worth a revisit."}
{"text":"I went here because it had stellar yelp reviews as well as it was on Anthony bourdains show 'lay over' or something like that. It's late on Saturday night and we just wanted something simple, greasy and good. We called to do takeout, and we ordered the burger, calamari, side of Mac and cheese. Let me just say, it was horrible.  Burger was decent, nothing special.  Was passable. Calamari was awful. It was marinated and served with spelt and orange. Not something u would expect to find on a 'diner' menu. It was overly sweet, chewy, and the portion was minuscule. It was 10 bucks and it was literally 4 forks worth of food.  That's probably for the best because it tasted like crap.  Fries were soggy and overly salty. Granted I ordered take out so maybe they sogged on the way home, but FYI I live less than 5 mins drive away...  Burger came with cole slaw too.  That was ok.  Just standard generic coleslaw. Something u would buy at the grocery store.  Mac and cheese was shameful. Smallest portion ever. I'd say like 2 tablespoons worth in a little container. First of all, the pasta was very al dente, if u like that, then you're in luck. However there was almost no sauce on it!! The sauce was extremely not cheesey and clumpy and still tastes of raw flour. That's a disgrace. What kind of diner mucks up Mac and cheese??? A crappy one, that's who.  I never write reviews but this was so bad that I had to stop all these fakers that are posting online from getting away with it."}
{"text":"Great food, simple menu but all good items. Good beer, good location, friendly staff. Beef sandwich was excellent, meet was juicy and tender. Spinach dip was good, the chips they serve with it have that good combination of salty sweet."}
{"text":"Overall, I'm pretty surprised Nouveau Palais lived up to eing a hip place... 4hipster people only?... humm... nope.  Well, let's start with their kickass cocktails... try the Limonade Rose and the Whiskey Sour... well priced...  You want to sweat? try the habenero sauce as a starter. Not exactly Mexicano but it is close... Pricey for non-standard items, and not overwhelming portion sizes, but seriously tasty.The menu seems to have changed a bit since others have reviewed it, and their specials are unique.    Only complaint is that the servers were definitely more hip than friendly.   Did I say this place have Hips?"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal last week and stumbled upon this hip diner in the Mile End. The staff, food and cocktails were fabulous.Jacques makes a mean martini and a great vodka pink lemonade. Went back several times and actually ran out of time to try everything we wanted to on the menu. Late night tacos, amazing weekend brunch, with seriously the best fluffiest scrambled eggs, it is simply  great food at reasonable prices and terrific atmosphere....wish I had a place like this in my neighborhood! My only regret is that I didn't try the burger!!"}
{"text":"A great little diner with not-so-conventional diner fare. Great Burgers! And also good for drinks!  Nouveau Palais used to be a veritable greasy spoon, but then the current owners bought it and actually put some thought into the menu. Now they have a  much more limited menu that includes some of the best burgers in Montreal, some pretty damn solid mac & cheese, and a few other things worth trying.  There are also nightly specials which are always fun to try if you get tired of the menu."}
{"text":"Great brunch in a relaxed atmosphere. We shared chicken waffles, pancakes, bacon & sausages. All very delicious and priced perfectly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Perfect. Most menu items fall in the \"comfort\" category but make no mistake this is sophisticated  food. Everything is done with great care. You can tell a lot about a restaurant by the salads. Their salads are all done with great attention to details and ultra-fresh ingredients. Service extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Well, this is kind of unfortunate but I have to do it. I'm going to make it short and sweet (or sour -- you can decide.).   Although the vibe is relaxed and Nouveau Palais is ultra casual, I wish they were less laissez-faire with their brunch menu. My boyfriend and I both agreed that our meals were way too salty and this isn't the first time we say this about the food here. It kinda made me wish I still smoked because I would of justified the excess salt but I couldn't this time because 1) We don't smoke and 2) I don't really salt much of my food anymore (ever heard of spices, NP?!) Anyway. I know a lot of people like this place, so maybe we got the chef on a bad day, but I don't like to make excuses for established restaurants - plus I had bad indigestion after I ate. I can always blame this on too much filtered coffee (I had 1.5 cups) but I am a regular coffee drinker so I am just going to be honest and say I was bummed by my experience. And I was disappointed the times I came before too. The end."}
{"text":"J'avais entendu parler de ce resto légendaire et aussi vu une visite à l'émission Glouton sur ma Apple TV.    Un classique \"dinner\" style hipster du Mile-End!  Le déjeuner au bar est excellent (comme la musique du DJ d'ailleurs)"}
{"text":"Get the lumberjack! You can do without the bloody cesar unless quality eggs are your thing. Grits are good too."}
{"text":"I am not going to say much, never paid so much for so little and my breakfast was tasteless to top it off   On the other hand, The service was nice!   Montreal offer tons of better options to eat that offers much more in terms of taste and quality and $$$$$   I don't think I'm ever going back..  this place was great before the new owner, you knew what to expect (greasy deliciousness ) and huge portions. Now it's like they trying to hard to be something different but end up being a deception."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times now and haven't been disappointed. Walk inside and experience a bit of a time warp, the decor reminding one of Montreal days past, combined with a younger hipster twist. The burger is one of the better ones I've had in Montreal. Also tried the ricotta beignets with maple caramel sauce and they were amazing. Also came once for brunch and had a tasty chicken and waffles plate. The staff is quite kind and attentive, the dishes are solid, and you can even get a drink. They have some funny work hours sometimes so double check that they're open."}
{"text":"Dinner menu.  Food was all good, if not spectacular. There were definitely many interesting menu items, though.  Good beer and cider selection.  \"A barely converted old diner with simple, impeccably cooked food, like a perfect egg salad sandwich, meticulous matzoh ball soup, and the ever-Canadian Lumberjack Sandwich (bacon, egg, and cheese between two maple-soaked pancakes).\""}
{"text":"My favourite spot in the neighbourhood. The ambience alone is worth a visit to grab a drink or some food. Their burger though, it is quite amazing. Favourite spot in the neighbourhood, cannot emphasize enough"}
{"text":"Bonne déclinaison de mets revisités du patrimoine culinaire maison américain (quoi que les spätzle aux pois verts retiennent probablement plus de la gastronomie allemande). Je voulais vraiment essayer le poulet frit, mais il n'y en avait plus lors de ma visite. Je suppose que je devrai y retourner!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the Winneburger and their snack sized burger so visiting the actual restaurant was something that needed to be done... what I expected was a burger that would be a bit bigger than the one I was used to but that day... I met the big brother burger. Same great taste and feel to the burger in an XL format, I loved it."}
{"text":"The late night menu of this place (only served on Thu/Fri/Sat) keeps it simple and delicious: cheeseburgers, fries and pierogies. The selection is short but whatever you pick you'll be very happy.   The restaurant is open until 3 am (again only Thu/Fri/Sat) and also serves alcohol in case you're looking for a last minute drink with your food. The service is great and the ambiance is very cozy.   If you order the cheeseburger I would recommend ordering with double patty. The meat is packed with flavour and tastes very fresh, so definitely double down if u can.   Both pierogies are delicious and I don't prefer one over the other. The cheese fries are very good but you don't really taste the cheese. I would surely recommend this place for anyone with a late night craving."}
{"text":"VERY COOL...VERY GOOD! Faux wood paneling, a taxidermy deerhead mounted on the wall, gourmet coffee, a midnight menu and a DJ spinning Tones On Tail and Archers Of Loaf have in common? Its a bit confusing like a cross between Deep Ellum and Reno, NV. They're food truck is in an old Winnebago. Some of these things should be off-putting to me but it all works somehow, seemingly genuine and keeps me interested. There's a dynamic scene (more later)   I moved into the Mile End and found this place immediately (my patio was directly across the street). I thought I discovered a gold mine, a seemingly innocent dive bar that I could occupy after work, but then found out it was \"trendy\" ... don't write it off too quickly for that, there's substance as well as a scene and depending on the time of day or night you go you'll see families, down-and-outs and/or artists and \"cool\" people there but it never alienates you or others from joining in. There's a limited menu but one of my all-time favorite burgers (It's REALLY good), I've had a few of the other items and all have been good to great. It's not really a dining destination and not really a bar ...it's somewhere i between"}
{"text":"First time getting the burger here and wow. It was so special. The bun, the meat, the cheese, everything about it was different and tasted so well together. I highly recommend paying the additional 1.50$ for cheese. It made such a difference. I hate when you can't taste the cheese in a cheeseburger.   Service was fast and efficient, the busboy was fun and helpful. The restaurant just has this aura of hipsterness and coolness. Everything comes together to make the experience different and out there. The place mats, the plates, the utensils, the music, the lights, everything works and is coherent and intensifies the experience.   Also worth mentioning is that I actually did go back for brunch and got the chicken and waffle. I heard a lot about this from tv shows and never thought it actually existed anywhere near me so it was an awesome surprise. And it was excellent. I love chicken, I love waffles, I love maple syrup, there's no way combining those things together could end badly."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town, so good and they don't overcook them. Salads are very fresh too as someone else mentioned. All desserts too are homemade and worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to go late at night, have a few cocktails and grab some grub on the late night menu. The cocktails are solid, The burgers are great, and the fries are amazing. I mean, it's not a unique cheeseburger, but this is one of the best classic burger I had in Montreal. The brunches are amazing too. The make one of the best fried chicken in town, it is a crispy, well-seasoned piece of chicken."}
{"text":"Had the burger once before which was decidedly amazaing, so this time I decided to spice it up, and went for the special: start with a bowl of borscht, followed by a hot beef sandwich with hot peppers and salad on the side. The borscht exceeded expectations and the sandwich delicious. The hot peppers might have been a little much, I would recommend sweet peppers for anyone who gets the same sandwich."}
{"text":"Came for the review \"Best burger in town\". Was disappointed.   Meat: like McDonald's, just thicker. Actually their Angus meat taste better.   Cheese: you don't feel it much.   Fries: very standard too. No funny sauce, just ketchup.   Overall, for a better price I'd go to Frites Alors or Five Guys.   I liked: - the variety and content of the drink and food menus (makes me want to come back)  - the staff - the atmosphere : cool wooden panels and great playlist  I will come back to try the rest of the menu or the brunch."}
{"text":"Honesty over good sense here.  sigh.  I LOVE THIS JOINT!  I live in Outremont and this is my little escape when I want a solo breakfast or lunch.  The waffles are otherworldly.  It's the only time in my life I've ordered waffles and actually been thrilled with them.  The burgers are killer and the chicken (which came with my waffle...crazy but great) was so good I ordered more as take-out to nosh on while I watched NHL playoffs later in the night.  Why honesty over good sense you ask?  Because the more honest I am the more business goes to this little hideaway (I haven't told my neighbours yet)...and the more business they get, the harder it becomes for little ole me to get a seat."}
{"text":"Pour la description synthétique, je ne peux qu'applaudir l'avis de Hugues B du 20/11/2012. Le nouveau Palais est effectivement d'un autre temps avec son enseigne, son mobilier en formica marron et les animaux empaillés. Il ne faut toutefois pas s'arrêter à cette première impression et la variété de la clientèle du Nouveau Palais le prouve. De mon côté, je n'ai goûté que les cocktails. Si la carte est réduite, elle propose cependant des classiques et permet donc d'y trouver son bonheur. Ici, point de dilution : les verres sont petits mais bien dosés. Si vous avez soif, vous pouvez toujours vous rabattre sur le verre d'eau :) Le service est agréable et la qualité de la cuisine m'a été vanté. Ne vous arrêtez pas à la devanture, entrez."}
{"text":"Trudged the few blocks through the April snow with my freshly arrived houseguest for food and drink.   Its a consistent kinda burger and fries magic.   Love this low key, cool diner."}
{"text":"The burger is a game changer featuring a beefy, juicy patty sitting pretty with tomato and lettuce. Montreal's best threesome? Depends who you ask. And what you're into.  Service is stellar. Music is playlist heaven with your fave indie & old school jams. Fun date spot. Always bring my out of town friends here. It's a must do or GET OUT.  The frozen in time, horrible but so damn good interior makes me swoon for this spot. If the Montreal version of Seinfeld was a thing, thus would be the diner. The wood paneling makes me want to drive a station wagon into the woods.   Into it."}
{"text":"An instant favourite of mine, Nouveau Palais has become THE place I introduce my visiting friends to. From the burger to the spaetzle to the serving of cookies and milk for dessert, the food here never disappoints.   The Palais is a definite local hangout, with great service, great drinks, and great music."}
{"text":"Delicious little diner on bernard. Their burgers are delicious, and I've heard their veggie burger is to die for (I'll have to try it next time!). While their menu is rather short, I still really enjoy frequenting this place, especially after a long day at work."}
{"text":"This was the happiest meal I had in Montreal.    Quebec must have a different definition of hipster than the US, because this place was not hipster at all. The outside looks unpromising, and the inside is no better - it resembles a 1970's basement den, complete with taxidermy (hi, stuffed fox in back corner). But true hipsterdom requires that the ambiance be intentional and ironic. This was just a little lazy.   Even the menu is understated, with only a few options, none of which are described in detail. At lunchtime, there were just 2 or 3 other tables occupied.  I was eyeing the fried chicken sandwich and our very sweet waitress confirmed that it was her favorite, \"depending on how indulgent you feel.\" Psh, I always feel indulgent. We also opted for a beef sandwich au jus with hot peppers.  Both came with a side of fries and slaw for $3 extra.  First of all, even their homemade mayo is delicious - smooth and rich. The fries are the skinnier kind, which is odd to see in a big fat frites town.  Also, they give you two slaw options: NYC style (creamy) or MTL style (vinegary). Get the MTL. It has a faint Asian taste I can't identify. But it is so fresh and so good. The two versions are actually not too different in taste, but why not try something newish.   Our food came after a brief wait. I don't remember the next 20 minutes clearly - I was sitting on a challah bread bun cloud, with juicy and crunchy fried chicken (boneless, dark meat, if you care) and cucumber slices all around me. Oh, it was also raining chipotle mayo. That's probably too descriptive. The sandwich was mindblowingly delicious. You may consider the fact that we walked 3 miles on empty stomachs to get here, but actually that probably made little difference. Fried chicken sandwich good. Get it.    The beef sandwich was a big thing sitting in a pool of lovely au jus. I had a yummy bite of it but mostly focused on my fried chicken. I'd intended to try the matzo ball soup but am glad I didn't. There just isn't the gastric real estate.  If you're looking for any old diner, you have a glut of other options (see what I did there). If you want comforting, delicious food obviously prepared fresh with thought and playfulness, in a low-key neighborhood setting, come to Nouveau Palais. The kicker is that prices are SO reasonable.   Also of note is that Nouveau Palais is a 5 minute walk from both famous Montreal bagel shops (St. Viateur and Fairmount). Think ahead. Wear your stretchy pants."}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw the good rating on Yelp, so I stopped by for a bite.  Apparently they don't do tacos anymore, but they do a damn good burger and fries! Man Montreal fries just can't miss can they? Didn't even need the cheese or bacon on the burger it was so tasty on its own!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Best place to come for late night eats. But I'm here now. The cheese fries come with a teaspoon on cheese. The poutine comes with about 3 cheese curds. And no bacon available to put on the burgers ? Are you serious? Nah. Very disappointed. Also... About a 20 minute before a waitress comes to see you. And the place is empty.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Super mega throwback greasy spoon diner with amazing food. We got fried chicken sandwiches and mac and cheeses. The chicken in the sandwiches were perfectly cooked, juicy, tender inside, crispy outside, and flavorful. The mac and cheese was rich, but could  used a little more salt."}
{"text":"I think everything changed at Nouveau Palais when the new owners including chef Gita Seaton got involved. We recently sampled the ribs with blackened rice and the steak sandwich and everything was subtle, tasty and great. The cocktails here are excellent and Jacques makes fresh lists of killer unique drinks, usually just $6 for all the house's special concoctions."}
{"text":"Nouveau Palais is an old-timey diner with wood panels and cozy banquet tables. I felt very comfortable and immediately liked the vibe here.   I hear their burger is the best but after spending the day walking in the Plateau on a very hot summer day, I wanted something a little lighter and so I chose their sandwich special of the day.  It was a pesto-tomato-potato chips on a onion bun; it had me at potato chips. Anything with potato chips is awesome. The sides were fries and cold slaw. The sandwich was really good and the ingredients were fresh.   I came here on a quiet afternoon and had the place all too myself. I'd be interested to check out how this place is on week nights because it just seems like that kind of place."}
{"text":"A modest diner?  In appearance only.   The food manages to be both gourmet and accessible.   We were told that the matzoh ball soup was the chef's grandmother's recipe and indeed, it tasted homemade - meant in a most delish way.  Also loved the squash side dish.  And my fish.  AND, oh my, the pie!  The five stars were also earned with great service and a wide selection of drinks - though I'm sure it wasn't just the Jameson's that made me love this place.  Now I just want them to move to Denver, where I live.  Ok, ok, I'll stop now."}
{"text":"Un \"Deli\" Hyper-Trash avec un menu hors du commun. Clientèle actuelle variée dans un décors d'une autre époque. La carte est simple et savoureuse. À essayer une ou plusieurs fois."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!  Traditional diner meets full bar; comes of age with just a tad of pretense and a 'je ne sais quoi' charm."}
{"text":"The burger was very good, the french fries too. A bit expensive but the quality of the burger is very high."}
{"text":"The Burger I had was extremely delicious. Staff is really friendly and the fries are nicely crisp and the total ambiance in this place is really nice and cozy! Great news? They've got a full bar so its an excellent place to hit for couples or for friends catching up. Must try folks! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"So far, I've only had the chance to go for the NYE Prix Fixe as I'm out of the country, but goddamn is this place good. I know that a Prix Fixe can't speak to the overarching quality of a restaurant, but everything was perfectly done that night. From the seared scallop app to the trimmed BBQ duck entree, the food was glorious. The service was also attentive, and humorous. Definitely gotta check this place out again when I move back to MTL."}
{"text":"Closed at 2am instead of its advertised 3am... We saw people inside and the waiters saw us, but ignored us.   Change your closing time to 2am so people won't be trying to come at 2:15am to a closed establishment."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what the hype is about this place. I went with a friend on a saturday night expecting good burgers or tacos, but they had an Indian theme that night. The appetizers were pretty bland, as were the main plates. I asked for some spicy sauce and the waitress looked offended, but it was the only thing that could help. Booths are also a bit tight."}
{"text":"This place was one of the first restaurants I tried when I moved to Montreal years ago, so when it was under a different ownership. I really really liked their cheeseburger then. Recently I went back and found their burger was still as good as before, if not better.  It was juicier and you could tell that the quality of the meat was good because they had the confidence to serve it slightly undercooked. The thing is, our server didn't give me a heads up that this was their typical way of serving it, so while I was enjoying the juicy bites I was equally worried that I might get sick later. At the end of the meal I asked the server and she  assured me it was normal for them to cook it that way. Phew. Everything else on my plate was good too: the coleslaw, the fries. My companion ordered fried chicken served with kale salad and bbq sauce. The chicken was alright, but it wouldn't be something we would re-order. I found the ambiance really pleasant, though it's not clear what kind of category this place would fall in. The setting suggested (clean) greasy spoon, but the price and menu (simple with an air of je-ne-sais-quoi) didn't make it quite so. If you're just looking for a recommendation for a burger place tho and don't mind forking around $15, you got one in this."}
{"text":"I love brunch and this place is a great spot to meet up with friends on Sunday morning. Their burger with egg is mouth-watering and trust me, I'm not a big fan of burgers.   The atmosphere is simple, it looks more like a diner than a restaurant but in a way it is perfect.   Overall, the food and the service are great, and this place is on my brunch list now."}
{"text":"Awesome, laid back eatery in the Mile End. Makes the old classics served with a twist. I had the roasted pork with the sweet potato pie for dessert a few weeks ago when I came here for dinner with a friend and it was just amazing.  Home-style comfort food cooking at decent prices, everything is fresh as as can be. friendly service, lots of Mile End hipsters.  Place doesn't look like much from the outside but once you're seated, the vibe totally changes. if I lived in this neighborhood, I'd be here all the time probably."}
{"text":"Je dois avouer n'être allé au Nouveau Palais que lorsqu'il y a des événements spéciaux. Par contre, j'ai quand même eu la chance de goûter à une bonne sélection des leurs plats typiques et des fameux cocktails de Jacques. À essayer: les burgers avec un verre de limonade rose (alcoolisée). Si vous ne savez pas trop quoi boire, n'hésitez pas à demander aux serveurs qui sauront vous recommander une bonne bouteille de vin qui accompagnera vos choix de nourriture parfaitement.  Pour les foodies, gardez vos yeux ouverts pour une affiche dans la porte d'entrée ou bien sur Facebook pour les soirées Cookies Unite. Une expérience à découvrir et à partager avec des amis. Ces un moment où des sous-chefs d'autres restaurants prennent contrôle de la cuisine de Gita pour un repas quatre services pour aussi peu que $30 par personne. C'est aussi une occasion parfaite pour s'y faire des nouveaux amis."}
{"text":"This is a cool, trendy place without it even trying. All they did was leave the original decor and it has come back in kitsch style again.  Food was delicious and sizable portions. I had a tasty eggplant parmesan which was moist and filled with flavor.  I would recommend the ice cream sandwich for dessert. Vanilla ice cream with fresh strawberry's inside a yummy ice cream sandwich."}
