{"text":"Hidden Gem!  Fresh bread, great ingredients and a nice guy behind the counter!  It is in the back of a Chevron gas station and you don't know it is there unless you are \"in the know\".  Had Sam cater my son's first birthday party, rave reviews from all guests!  I need to have another party just so I can have him cater again.  He doesn't deliver but will have everything ready and boxed up for you. Only bar seating for a handful inside and 3 picnic tables outside.  Not great for large groups unless you are taking it to go. I have enjoyed several sandwiches from the menu and keep going back for more!   Eat at Sam's!"}
{"text":"I avoided this place a few times when a friend of mine suggested it and eventually I caved. I'm glad I did. He loves pastrami and I had never had it. Lucky for me my first one was very legit. According to him. All I know is that it was goooood."}
{"text":"Very good sandwich.  Don't let the fact that it's at a gas station bother you."}
{"text":"They have some of the greatest sub sandwiches here, the only thing about it is you just tell Sam, \"Make it like it's your's\" he will the put on everything and he'll ask if you want Chiles which are somewhat spicy, so get those if you like some spice on your sub, as well as asking if you want olives. A sandwich I would recommend would be the Miami Club, but everything there is absolutely delicious. Just remember it's cash only!"}
{"text":"The best roast best sandwiches  are made here! I would definitely  recommend Sams famous Subs"}
{"text":"The gist of it all I guess has to be put in pro and con format:  pro: you are getting a 12\" sub and some, they are big, not much meat but big.  pro: you can order more meat and does not cost too much more like 2.00  con: the subs are okay tasting, but kind of bland even with condiments.  con: nothing really stands out on the subs in terms of wow factor beside size.  pro: bread is fresh and soft, has some variety, meat and cheese are freshly cut.  con: the hot sandwiches are just microwaved, bread is not toasted,   pro: lastly the price is reasonable even with extra meat.  So there you have it, I like the sandwiches I ate there, but they were nothing special, of course they are better than subway but not as tasty as some of the locals sub places and cafes. I don't mean any of the chain, most of those sucks. Do try and at least you will be full even if you don't like it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Fast friendly service. Had the Miami fat boy with Italian hot peppers. So good.... Fresh baked sub roll. I would recommend and will definitely return. The world needs more places like this. Great food, good prices, fast friendly service. A winning combination. Thank you Sam."}
{"text":"Stop in at the Chevron and Sami's is right there.   Sami makes the best subs in the Valley !  I love the hot pastrami with double meat, jalapeños, olive oil and tomatoes.  He has several toppings to choose from.  He also has fresh bread made daily. I like my sub on Parmesan or jalapeño bread.   Cash only.  There is an ATM in the gas station."}
{"text":"Had a 6\" Sammy's Big Boy and man was it good! I can throw down a 12\" Subway Sub with ease. But this 6\" filled me up with a bag of chips and a drink. Less than $8.00 and good till dinner. Great sub shop in the back of a chevron gas station."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I ordered a Cheese veggie sandwhich, but  didn't get the American cheese (which menu stated). He sliced up the other two kinds and looked at me and said \"OK?\"  Umm, I guess so. I added my toppings and asked for extra oil and vinegar, but he put very little on it. It was good, but could have been great. Next time I won't be so intimidated, and will order exactly what I want and make sure I get the extra stuff that I order."}
{"text":"Best subs in the east valley!!!! I went here based on a recommendation and I was not let down!! The food is fresh and the flavor is impeccable!!! It is my new obsession! It is cash only but you can get cash back at the gas station next door. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"First things first. Yes, it is in a gas station but don't let that deter you.   The sandwiches are very large and filling.  We got the roast beef and Miami best and they were both delicious.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"These are what you call subs. You are going to eat good bread, a lot of quality meat, and no shortage of cheese and proper toppings. Oil and vinegar bring it all together."}
{"text":"From their freshly made breads and cold cuts sliced right in front of you, there is no doubt about the amazingness you are about to devour! Sam had a special touch to his scrumptious sandwich creations! Italian hoagie is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh here, love the Serrano peppers with olive oil....,, My favorite Sandwich place"}
{"text":"This a 5 star sub hands down!  Same is what you would call the sandwich nazi. He refuses to make a bad sandwich.  He asked my wife if she wanted mayo and she said no and he replied, I'll put it a little bit. He then asked how about peppers she said no and he said I'll just put a little bit.  When he finished he said this is going to be a good sandwich.  My wife and I still come here as often as we can.  We've hired him for parties and work events. The best sandwiches."}
{"text":"LEGIT!!  From the fresh cut meats to the veggies this place is good. I'm glad for Yelp or I would never find this place. Yes, it's in a Chevron gas station but it is pumpin out some dang good Sammie's at a very lost cost. Breads are very good and tasty. This is a step above the usual suspects( subway, J Johns , firehouse) at a great price point"}
{"text":"Everything is super fresh, stuffed with tons of filling, and huge.Yum!"}
{"text":"Had the Italian Hoagie and it was awesome! Fresh bread, toppings and deli meat sliced to order.  I couldn't tell if they were just moving in or moving out but didn't stick around because I knew I had this sandwich made with love to eat! Will be back Sammy!"}
{"text":"Darn! I was so excited to try this place after all these great reviews. I get it, it's a gas station sub shop, but still it could be better. I was happy to see jalapeño bread on the menu as a change to the typical white/wheat option. The bread was pretty dry, so all the toppings that were wet soaked in quickly resulting in a sub that fell apart by the time I went across the street to work to eat it. My lettuce was brown and the chicken he used in the buffalo sandwich was a little pink and mushy in the middle. It didn't taste fresh at all. Maybe it was just an off day, hopefully!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today I asked for double meat and a shithead giving me double meat this guy is a moron try and think you're in New York but you're not this is one of the worst sandwiches I ever had it in Arizona this guy owes me another sandwich this place is a joke I wouldn't waste my time going back here ever again for what you pay for the sandwich to have boars head cold cuts this place was a joke never waste your time again thank you for ripping me off"}
{"text":"Great sub!!!! Everything tasted so fresh! I would recommend it if looking for a sub!!"}
{"text":"I had the 6\" Miami Best on whole wheat.  It was a lot of sandwich, and I loved every bite of it.  The meat portions were very generous, and the toppings were all very fresh and tasty.  Like other reviews have said, don't let the fact that this place is inside of a gas station convenience store scare you off.  I believe it is as good of a sub sandwich, if not better, that I would find at just about any other sandwich shop that I could think of."}
{"text":"Great sandwich in an unexpected place! This place has ended up on the MUST NOT DRIVE PAST list. Any sandwich you care for they can make it and you can love it!"}
{"text":"Sam's serves up a solid sub!!  Get over the fact they practically have no signage, and are hidden in the back of a Chevron Gas Station, because the subs are made proper!!  I ordered a Footlong Miami Fatboy with hot peppers, it was really good.  I love that my sandwich was drenched in oil and vinegar and topped with oregano!! The meats and cheese were quality, and the bread selection was nice.  The Footlong itself was stout, worth every penny of $6 and change price tag.  Bring cash because your credit cards are no good here!"}
{"text":"Don't let the gas station restaurant scare you..  This is THE best sandwich you will ever have the pleasure of tasting!  Sam (the owner) hand crafts your custom sub perfectly.  He takes pride in every master piece sandwich he builds.  Sam owned a sandwich shop in Chicago and brought the fresh ingredients and artistry to AZ.  This is a life changing sandwich!  It will become a ritual to eat here!  You're Welcome!"}
{"text":"Sam's Famous Subs are the best you will find anywhere in AZ ! We have been coming here for 13 years and I have to say I have never had a better sandwich . We love the fresh breads meats and veggies . This is a secret Spot that everyone needs to try . You will not be disappointed ."}
