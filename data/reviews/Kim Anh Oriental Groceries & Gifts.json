{"text":"The lady that is always there in assuming is the owner she's very sweet, when she isn't there there's this other younger gal she's very rude, she doesn't greet you, always on her phone and doesn't smile, bad attitude!!! Will not hesitate to curse her tail out one day!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Everything is very expensive compared to other asian groceries store. Most items are not priced, i bought bean sprouts there regularly and lady at the counter charged me differently everytime. Sketchy! They dont have anything there. Everything need to be pre order! Really?  The place is clean but what the hell am i gonna do in there if they have the thing i need. They need to stock up!"}
{"text":"Over priced, and terrible service. If you needed some help carrying heavy items, forget it. I got 5 cases of soy bean drinks and had to carry myself after I asked THEM to bring it up to the register. Be careful, the owner/cashier will overcharge you too. Ordered 9 more cases of drinks from her and she didn't have it. She kept saying next week. By the third week, I gave up."}
{"text":"The good: Super close location, very clean, good variety
  
The so-so: most items are medium to small sizes and a bit over priced for less quantity. 

The bad: the owner and helpers aren't rude but appear visibility annoyed to help or answer questions. During the same visits they had completely different attitude with other Vietnamese customers. So maybe it is just a language barrier. 

Bottom-line: this will allow okay place for last emergency items but not our weekly shopping. Disappointing..."}
{"text":"Good selection of Asian products. I'm personally a fan of Trung Nguyen Vietnamese Coffee. Reasonable prices, the only thing I didn't like was the employee. She was talking on her phone and seemed like I was bothering her when I had a question."}
{"text":"Lack of customer service! That is all I can say and I will rather order from Amazon from now on. When I shopped there, it was dead slow, and I was looking for something but the lady didn't even try to look for the item to help saying that's all they have got."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations going in here on the costumer service end as I never feel very welcome in Oriental/Asian Grocery stores.  This shouldn't matter, but I am white and I could tell quite clearly that the lady did not want to answer my questions.  To be honest, she probably wanted me to leave, but I shop at these places because I value some of the food that they sell.  It is unfortunate, that people like her are rude as it does bother me a little.  To give an unbiased review not based on the lady's nasty attitude though the store was well organized and seemed cleaned. I didn't notice the prices being overly expensive either.  There was a strong odor of garbage rot that hits you once you come in, but I was not shopping for produce so it didn't bother me.  I wouldn't purchase any fresh produce or anything like that there.   Also, I like some of the china bowls that are generally sold at this type of store, unfortunately I could tell they only sold cheap ones there.  Also, nothing is organic - not even the tofu or tea.

Overall, kinda disappointed.  The customer service was the worst part and it makes me sad that people are that negative and rude to other nationalities.  By the looks of the reviews, the owners and operators may just be rude in general.  Smiling and being nice goes a long way.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I stumbled past here one night after making a wrong turn and getting stuck in some evil Steele Creek rush hour swirl of doom. I happened to see this place, so I thought I'd kill some rush hour time by perusing the Asian grocery store.

Huge plus is they were really, really clean. I mean the place smelled like Lysol or something. This was such a huge surprise given that, seriously no offense here, but most Vietnamese shops smell so strongly of fish and weird pickled things. 

They have a truly astounding variety of non-wheat noodles. I love this. Wheat is a huge cause of inflammation, and I've been trying to eat less of it, but I was just lamenting that I will miss noodles. Not to fear, because the Vietnamese have you covered. The prices aren't bad, I thought. Charlotte isn't exactly swimming with a high Asian population, but I'll take it.

Big, big, big, big CON is that the staff was initially very nice to me until it seems that they found out I am not Vietnamese. Then, I swear to you, the woman at the counter stopped making eye contact with me. Instead of speaking to me regarding a question I had, I got curt, clipped responses, and she seemed to try her best not to look at me. This was almost a total 180 from when I walked in the door. 

I haven't decided whether I'd come back here. I'm torn between wanting to patron an Asian grocery store, especially one so clean, and not wanting to give my money to such horribly rude and prejudiced people. ...But the noodles..."}
{"text":"The owner overcharged everytime I shop there. She would charge me more than the sticker price and would charge me with items that I didn't buy. The receipt is unclear , no item descriptions.... just prices and whatever she wants to charge. Be careful. She's a thief."}
