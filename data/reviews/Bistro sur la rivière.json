{"text":"This bistro has a very intimate, neighborhood restaurant feel...and the food was delicious! We ended up sitting at the bar since all seats were taken even on a Thursday evening, but enjoyed watching the chef prepare all the dishes. The Bistro Burger was AMAZING. Seriously one of the best burgers I've ever had. Would love to recommend this place to anyone who lives in the neighborhood or is visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Ce bistro vaut le détour. Les plats sont beau, toujours frais et ce n'est vraiment pas cher! Il y a seulement une trentaine de place alors il est bien de réserver.  Le seul hic pour moi c'est les heures d'ouverture!"}
{"text":"Petit Resto de quartier sympathique qui n'est pas très loin de la rue Ontario . Belle ambiance .Le menu est très bon mais ne change pas souvent . J'ai trouvé les soupes très bonnes surtout avec le poivre rose . Devrait être un peu moins cher par contre"}
{"text":"I honestly can't speak more highly of this place!! My family and I were staying at a local Airbnb in the Plateau and stumbled upon this lovely local restaurant. Though our waitress spoke French, she was incredibly patient as we used our limited French and google translate to communicate.   Though the restaurant is fairly small, it is a nice intimate space with quirky decor and the perfect place for a nice dinner.   The food was AMAZING. For vegetarians, there aren't many options; however, our waitress was incredibly accommodating and altered some menu items for us to remove meat. We ended up ordering the lentil soup, a special vegetarian croque madame, and the tomato/pesto/brie sandwich. Everyone loved their meals and we were particularly impressed by the fries!"}
