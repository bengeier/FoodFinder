{"text":"The other reviewer skipped over the pizza for a reason.  I paid $20 for two large pizzas but could have saved time and money if I got some cardboard out of their dumpster.    I was embarrassed for serving this pizza to our out-of-state guests when I thought it might compare to a real Pizza King (like what you might find in Indiana).  Oddly enough, it tasted better the next day (I'm not one to throw out anything I paid good money for) after the moisture from the cheese was absorbed by the paper thin crust.    My guests did appreciate the unique organization of the video selection but that's about all you'll get from this place."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town.  I definatly prefer it to monicals, padanos, and papa johns.  The staff is great."}
{"text":"Small town carry-out pizza served with a smile. Wide selection of new release movies."}
{"text":"I've been to pizza king on several occasions and it has been consistently good.  Friendly service and a great value."}
{"text":"Pizza is two star pizza. The italian beef however is great,and the movie selection brings my review to three stars."}
{"text":"I would compare this to the pizza we used to order when we were in college and had been out all night drinking.  It is cheap, and you get what you pay for.  That's not to say it tastes bad by any means.  It's just that you can get better tasting pizza (although you will have to pay more).    It has been a while since we had Pizza King, and at the time they only took cash or check.  I am not sure if that has changed since then, but in this day and age I find it is almost a shock if businesses do not accept credit or debit cards.  I know that makes me sound snobby, but chalk that up to consumer evolution.  I know this will also make me sound snobby, but what's with the videos?  I'm sure there was a time when that was all the rage.  I get it!  Pick up a pizza and some videos for movie night with the family.  It's not the concept I disagree with.  It's the execution.  What with On Demand, Netflix, and the like I don't know that many people who still go to the video store.  BUT if it works for Pizza King then they shouldn't change a thing.  I'm not saying I would avoid Pizza King.  We usually end up getting pizza from one of the other pizza joints in town.  However, should I have a flashback to the college days I will eat Pizza King in my drunken bliss."}
