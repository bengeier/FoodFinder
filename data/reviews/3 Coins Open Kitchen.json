{"text":"I love it here- I feel like I'm in the 70s! The staff are all friendly, the food is your classic greasy spoon, but the difference is that I don't feel sick after eating it! The only time I've been disappointed was when I came here over the weekend and it was packed! It was a long wait list, so my friends and I had to choose another place. Other than that, their prices are good, the food tastes good, but I only wish their mini jukeboxes worked! Overall, I would definitely recommend it here!"}
{"text":"I love this place with its old fashion diner menu. I however don't recommend it to people who are picky about a bit of old fashion greasy food."}
{"text":"After 30 years of living in Richmond Hill, I don't know why I never ate here! Visited with my family for breakfast over the holiday weekend and boy was it every packed! The wait was long and service was slow as they happened to be understaffed. This is one of those places where you just gotta come on a weekend and spend the time, don't rush and enjoy a good 2 hours here between waiting for a table, waiting for food and eating. Was the food worth the wait? Hells yeah, portions are huge and price was very good! The potatoes were incredible and food fresh made to order. We would definitely be back, and will be prepared to be here awhile."}
{"text":"The breakfast has good flavour but my most recommend meal is the hot beef sandwich which in my case is better for brunch the the price is reasonable it's a good place to be a regular"}
{"text":"A real hidden gem. We had the corn beef hash and peameal bacon, and everything was superb. The potatoes are especially tasty. Couldn't ask for more for a diner breakfast."}
{"text":"The epitome of a greasy spoon diner, this place reminds me of Riverdale.  Complete with mini jukeboxes at every booth, you can sip on a milkshake that's been made through an olden-timey milkshake blender...though you probably wouldn't want to sit here for long: the place is has \"vintage charm\" (aka old tables, chairs, slightly dingy floors and walls). Food is run-of-the-mill: pancakes were mediocre, nothing too fancy, but prices are low and pretty much exactly what you'd expect of a typical diner.  There's really no particular draw to this place unless you're in the area and just looking for a quick breakfast, or you're dying to soak in some 1950's ~vibes~ while gushing about Buff Archie."}
{"text":"3 Coins is the real deal. It has those wonderful zodiac vinyl booths and tableside jukebox machines. The coffee is good and so is the food. I was really happy with the way this place turned out."}
{"text":"For as long as I can remember living in Richmond Hill, the neon signage of 3 coins open kitchen has been lit. Being a surviving staple in the downtown Richmond Hill core for near 60 years it is as much a part of the town as the heritage homes or the World War monument. It's a reminder of our small town routes, and pangs me with nostalgia when I think about everything it has seen change around it in that time.

It had been some time since my last venture in for a quick fried egg sandwich on the go, and being that I hadn't been in a true open kitchen greasy spoon in ages I decided to venture in.

I'll be frank about this place - it aint pretty. The floors have seen better days and many of the chairs, look dated (then again that is what they're going for). However, I feel like a quick clean up could really make this place pop once again. The aforementioned Neon lights have not been on in ages and the outside white wash finish is getting weather beaten and dirty. BUT don't judge this book by it's cover, like a seasoned veteran this place has character and a story. And I guarantee if you sit still long enough you can hear it.

Alright, enough romantic nostalgia

I entered and was warmly greeted by the cook and lone waitress and was offered any seat I would like. being an open kitchen purist I sat on a bar stool steps away from the cook and a cup of coffee was immediately place in front of me. Had I been a smoker (and had smoking been allowed indoors today) this would have been the perfect time + place to drink said coffee and enjoy said smoke while reading the days news. 

I should add that despite the place being busy for 1 server, she was impeccable, she seemed to have an uncanny mental trigger for knowing when my coffee hit half mast and was on me about refills right away. The coffee never even had a chance to cool and I'm sure I had about 5 cups before leaving (still shaking 2 days later).

Perusing the menu I saw many basics and classic fare and a few additions (like egg whites only) for the health conscious (don't be a wiener and order an egg whites at a greasy spoon - that's a cardinal sin...COME ON). I decided on sticking with my breakfast go to and asked for the Eggs Benedict with Pemale bacon instead of ham.
 
The blessing and the curse of an open kitchen is that you can see how everything is made, and my only criticism was that the hollandaise sauce was heated in the microwave before being added to my dish...tsk tsk. However that being said, the 2 pemale STEAKS that adorned my english muffins, acted as a landing pad for my perfectly cooked eggs and nuked holly-sauce.

Judges: ITS GOOD!

Despite my concerns the meal was tasty, filling, a great value and made quick as can be.

Now despite this semi glowing review, you might be asking: \"Well heck Kris, why the 3 star\" . Well friend lemme tell you, 3 coin is a greasy spoon and it doesn't pretend be anything more or anything less. It manages your expectations and delivers consistently (more than I can say for some ex girlfriends...hey-yooooo LOL). I kid. But to give this place a 5/4 star would be to set your expectations sky high. In my books its a 3-3.5 BUT an incredibly strong one at that. I challenge you to disagree, in fact I bet you try this place out and struggle to give it anything less than a 4. 

Some might call this place a dive.... but it's my local dive.....and I hope it never changes"}
{"text":"If you watch the Food Network show Diner's , drive -ins and dives .. or You gotta eat here... For real you have to try this place ... Reminence of 50's 60's diner.. with a dive type appeal .. the food is amazing.  It's fast , friendly service and the price is just right.  My go to breakfast for work"}
{"text":"When we first arrived i noticed that the restaraunt had a really cool old school vibe. Our booth had a authentic juke box and the neat decor of motown. I went there with a friend for breakfast. I got the breakfast special of three eggs, toast and sausage. I also got coffee wth my meal and it wasn't charged to me.  The portion sizes were good and the food was also pleasant. We also overheard a group of old ladies audibly agreeing with us and comparing it to Koras, saying \"this place gives a proper amount of home fries\". 

The service was also great. Since the main server had not yet arrived the cook quickly took our order and brought us coffee. As far as breakfast joints go, this one does it right."}
{"text":"I concur with all the reviews here. Great 50-60's style  diner with character. 

My big tip; Grab a stool at the long narrow counter and chat with some fellow diners and watch the  chefs in frenzied action creating all the delicious dishes. They even have a vintage green Hamilton- Beach milkshake machine!...brings back child hood memories when I used to go to the local diner and sit at the long bar ordering  milkshakes and fries 40 years ago as kid..."}
{"text":"The breakfast including eggs, bacon, toast and home fries was very tasty and filling. You can't beat the prices.  And the decor fits a classic 50s diner.  It's one of the few places in the heart of Richmond Hill that has stood the test of time.  Definitely worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Still by far one of my favourite breakfast/brunch spots!! If you haven't beenAND you live in the area, you've been missing out! 

I get the hash with eggs over easy - highly recommend. It's a tasty hash that you can barely find in other breakfast spots. They also have all the regular breakfast combos that you can find in most places. If you're more of a sweet morning person, the pancakes are really fluffy and I don't think it'll really disappoint. Also they offer white, brown or rye bread, and that rye bread is always my go to.

As for the environment, it's awesome. If you life feeling homey, and in a cool old school type of place this is perfect! It's a cute diner where there are regulars who greet each other and stop to chat. It's the closest thing I've seen to the cute small town feeling in a bigger city, which is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place. Nice to even go alone for a quick breakfast! I never wait in line for a table, I just sit on the stools in front of the cooks beside the cash!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Richmond Hill and Thornhill, how I found this place I have no idea but obviously at some point it peaked my interest.

We were by far not alone in our idea to check this place out on a Wednesday afternoon as it was packed and only chairs at the bar were found.

They did not make their customers seemed rushed which is a nice element. The 50's diner decor makes for some fun observations. It is an open kitchen concept which keeps staff/chefs accountable.

Menu consists of cheap, typical breakfast and lunch fare. Meals are brought quickly and cooked perfectly. Both my dad and I had the breakfast special (3 eggs, bacon/sausage, home fries and toast). Most of the breakfast was top notch. Dad's home fries were better than mine but otherwise no complaints.

Price point is extremely reasonable. Definitely considering a return to this place in the future!"}
{"text":"3 Coins needs no introduction.  It is a Richmond Hill institution.  If you don't know what I am talking about, just read the reviews of other Yelpers; the history is spelt out again and again. 

With all its history, 3 Coins stays true to its root as a greasy spoon diner.  The outside looks like a diner, the (run down) interior looks like a diner, the menu contains diner food, and the services are in diner style.  I ordered a 3-egg omelette with corn beef ($8.45), a typical diner all day breakfast item.  Of course the eggs were fresh, and the cooking was typical/average/good enough.  The onion inside added a nice texture.  I was impressed with the quantity of corn beef though.  It was in every centimeter of the omelette.  Talking about not skimping on ingredients.  The bangs for your bucks is amazing.

The place was packed at 9:30am the Saturday morning I visited.  There was a line up for table.  The services could be faster, but the 2 waitresses were overwhelmed by the business volume, so I couldn't blame them.  Owners/management should take note of the business volume on weekend mornings.

Solid 3.5 stars.  It could easily be 4 stars if the services was faster."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars

Great greasy spoon where breakfast reigns supreme.

Located in the core of Richmond Hill (between Centre St and Arnold) on Yonge, the place is a throwback to a 50's diner (with the decor to match) and possesses the smallest kitchen I've ever seen.

We popped in for the first time on a Sunday morning for breakfast, having heard the food is good and reasonably priced. I found the prices to be comparable to other breakfast joints but they have great combinations (for example, you can get a bkfst plate with no eggs...just meat, home fries and toast). 

There was a small line up at the door when we arrived..but after a nominal wait time (less than 10 minutes), a table cleared and we were seated. After perusing the menu, we ordered:
1) pemeal bacon, with home fries, toast and egg whites....I think it was in the $8.50 range. The star of the plate were the home fries..they were excellent and were \"real\" home fries...not the store bought kind. These were the real deal.
2) bacon platter....6 strips of bacon, home fries and toast. Partner said it was excellent and he raved about the home fries as well.

Staff were exceptional..they know how to work the room and frequently dropped by to top up coffee, check on our needs.

Great food, great staff....loss of points for decor..it's pretty cheesy."}
{"text":"This review is late coming. This little diner is close to my dentist and orthodontist in RH. One morning I had overestimated the traffic and was very early for an appt so I thought why not.

I went in for a simple BLT and coffee. I was welcome to sit anywhere but since I was alone I chose the 60s style counter. Service was fast and friendly. I could have made this myself at home, but rarely buy bacon, so I enjoyed the treat. It was so fast that I still had time to brush my teeth before my appt. All in a solid 3."}
{"text":"3 Coins is worth its weight in gold, and then some. The food is delicious and extremely affordable. The staff is accommodating and the waitress is lively! I recommend the Eggs Benedict, I substitute peameal for tomatoe slices."}
{"text":"Great place for eggs benedict! I came here with a friend on a weekday, not very busy and the service was great.  Friendly and attentive.  This is a 50s diner at Yonge and Major Mackenzie in Richmond Hill. The atmosphere looks like it hasn't changed in many years, and it's been preserved well.  The place is small and there's only one bathroom stall each for men and women.  It's not a fancy place--it really does give you that old school feel, similar to Wimpy's. Food options were good and the prices, although used to be cheaper, are now more comparable to other breakfast places like Steve's or Cora's. The eggs benedict was great, flavourful sauce and very filling.  If you like Steve's you'll like it here!  I also prefer 3 Coins' home fries as they have burnt marks on them which makes them crispier and tastier. :)

Parking is at the rear and you can enter the restaurant from there too. Look for the hand-written sign on the door!"}
{"text":"Was liking for local to get a decent breakfast at 6 in the morning. My experience was a 7 out of 10. The place has a stuck in the 60's vibe about it, which rubbed me the wrong way. But the food makes up for that. I got exactly what I ordered and the way I ordered it. The food was out faster than most diners I've been too and that's a plus if you have places to go. All in all this place isn't a a bad place to get a bite to eat. Just make sure you get a combo and don't add things cause four pieces of turkey bacon cost and extra 4.50. That's nuts."}
{"text":"A landmark in Richmond Hill.  I have driven by this place over 100 times in the past 30 years and I never stopped to try it out.  Today I took the plunge.

After walking into 1960's I was greeted and offered a seat in the other half of the restaurant.  One server was extremely nice and friendly the other was ok.

The menu is very classic, eggs, sandwiches, home burger, and other items you would expect.

We ordered an Omelette, Eggs and Hash, 3 Eggs special.
The coffee was hot and not watered down. So I was very happy.
The place was packed for lunch and people seemed very happy.

The 3 Eggs and Toast was great,  Eggs and Hash was excellent, the omelette lacked flavour.
2 / 3 not bad.

The other major disappointment is that they use Margarine and there is no butter.
Seriously.  We all know that margarine is not good for you.  So :(

Lunch comes under $10 / person which is very reasonable these days.

As for the place.  I don't know why the owners are not fixing this place up a bit.  Its looking more run down by the year.  It is a gem and is a shame that they don't put some effort in keeping it up.  It has some great potential.

Hope management does a bit of cleanup to take this place to the next level.
I would love to see this place make it to 100 Years."}
{"text":"The mother of all greasy spoons has been in downtown Richmond Hill since 1955. People have been going to 3 Coins Open Kitchen for seventy years to:

Have a cheap breakfast, brunch or lunch
Eat a Canadian bacon, pancake, omelette or eggs
Listen to tunes on the jukeboxes that don't work
Drink fresh coffee or
Have a heart attack
or a combination of the above 

and should do so for another seventy years (or at least until another greedy developer takes over the land and builds another ugly abomination of a 'condo') if all goes well.

With Steer Inn Burger sold and transformed to something else 3 Coins... is the last vestige of a Richmond Hill long gone. The good news is that the old vibe, cheap prices and greasy menu items at this mainstay of town remain.

The place is hectic, there is a queue, the parking lot in the back is full and yet the waitresses are workmanlike and polite, the cooks work at breakneck pace and the French toast is actually very good.

PS: Could someone get the manager at Uncle Tetsu Angel Cafe to come up here and learn how the business hours of a food-related establishment should work? 3 Coins... is open 7 days a week from 6:00 to 3:00 rain or shine with no variation or exceptions."}
{"text":"I frequent here atleast 2 times a week. It's the cutest 50's styled diner like restaurant. It's got real good quality character. They have the best breakfast in town as well as there lunch menu. Best chicken club, roast beef sandwich, the soups of the day. I honesty have loved everything I have ever gotten from there. The service is great! Only problem is I wish the place was open for dinner to. Who doesn't want to eat all day breakfast and chicken clubs for dinner :) they close at 3pm daily."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid with my parents on weekend mornings, and I continue to make an effort to do-so when I've got some downtime. Old school 50's diner with all the breakfast options you'd expect. They do it right, and for the right price. Nothing particularly phenomenal on the food front, but it's good and the neighbourhood vibe is great. it's truly a staple in the community."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was great and the service delicious! I had the Eggs Benny and watched it being made. The guys in the \"kitchen\" made their job look easy. A pleasant Sunday brunch just north of beautiful Toronto."}
{"text":"No complaints at all amazing staff, amazing food overall a great local place keep doing what you guys are doing."}
{"text":"A very traditional back in the days diner that everyone should experience at least once. A lot of the furniture was well maintained including the individual jukeboxes at the booths. It's a small diner therefore amount of seating and hallway spaces were limited. We went on Father's Day and had to wait about 30-45 mins in the heat (minimal AC).

FOOD:
- Roasted beef + gravy was a delicious combination. They advertised on their logo that they have the best roasted beef and they did not lie. Never chewy, easy to bite into. The homemade coleslaw was very homemade as not a lot of flavour compared to the ones from the stores. 

- Home fries was seasoned well, you don't need ketchup at all. 

SERVICE:
- not as organized. When you see people lining up, you would have thought to leave a name on the list, but nope. They just let you stand and wait, when there's an open table, they asked how many in each party and if it fits the table then they will be served."}
{"text":"4.5/5

According to its menu, 3 Coins opened in 1955. The place has been renovated and gone through several owners since then. Along with the surrounding churches, it is one of the few surviving landmarks in the old town of Richmond Hill, dating back to the town's post-war boom years. The diner is complete with an open kitchen, checkered wall tiles, black and white movie posters, jukeboxes at each booth, and other memorabilia to make one nostalgic for the good old days. Even for a fella in his twenties. The walls are adorned with specials printed on paper. Service is laid-back, and friendly. I mean the real \"more coffee hun?\" type of service. Their menu is split into two pages, one for breakfast and the other for lunch and dinner. The breakfast side has all the belly-filling, arterial plaque inducing classics plus several types of omelets for the \"health conscious\". The lunch and dinner offerings are typical. Steaks, roast beef, burgers etc. All in all, 3 Coins Open Kitchen is a classic diner with a service and decor that is as authentic as you can get these days. What makes this place special for me is that it is one of the only places in Richmond Hill, where you can get a real breakfast. And by breakfast, I do not mean a bran muffin and cappuccino or Cora's over-priced and flamboyantly arranged fruit (nothing wrong with either of those things). Sadly, I can't help but think of this place eventually giving way to a real estate or dentist's office, like many of its neighbors have over the years."}
