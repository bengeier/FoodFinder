{"text":"Food is okay but definitely not authentic indian food.. One thali and one fresh bowl took thirty mins to come. It is also well overpriced comparing to other indian places. Not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty food that is well priced. Lunch all you can eat gives you the opportunity to sample a few different menue items. Portion size is also good."}
{"text":"Went on a whim- we were very happy we did. Excellent samosas, baked cauliflower and short ribs. Tying it all together was very strong service and an easy going, casual atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First of all,  it took them forever to take our order.  second of all,  it took them forever to bring the food and it took them forever to give us the bill.  Third of all the portion is very small for what they charge. The poor guy was running around to serve everyone in a very hectic day all by himself. We would never go back there again....."}
{"text":"Such good food and the staff is so friendly! Kind of becoming our new spot . Finally something good in the area, it's a little hard to find wish it replaced the thornhill pub location"}
{"text":"I decided to try the catering at The Fat Beet and ordered food for 15 people, everything was delicious. For appetizers:samosa and beet tikki. For dinner:Butter chicken, lamb curry, saag paneer, chana masala, rice and naan. The service was great and my food was ready on time. All my guests enjoyed the flavours and quality (not oily)of all the dishes. I will definitely order again from The Fat Beet."}
{"text":"My first experience at THE FAT BEET was great! The staff were very friendly and made sure we were okay and checked on us regularly.  The restaurant is very clean and well ventilated. For shareable appetizer we ordered the zucchini fritters  which were deep fried with cheese and weren't super oily; it was crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside.  The halibut was cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.  This dish was light, fish was flaky and was served with a salad with a light tasty dressing.  The last dish we ordered was the chicken Tikka meatball pita.  Loved the Indian flare to a classic meatball. The food was awesome and I will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening and it was fairly empty. It might have something to do with the fact that it was extremely difficult to find. I was confused as to why Google maps was leading me into a condo. Turns out there are a few restaurants right there but is a bit misleading to people not familiar with the area.

The decor of the place was nice and had a hipster vibe. Lots of windows and decent furniture. Only downside was that the sun was beaming directly into my eyes for most of the dinner since they didn't have any blinds. 

Service was good and everyone was polite and offered good recommendations to people who haven't been before. They also gave everyone a complementary small glass of mango lassi while we were waiting for our food. I opted for the lamb skewers, which were slightly dry but still tasty. Although, I still think the food was overpriced for what we got. Also, TIP IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE BILL! It was written in bold on out receipt but only 1 person saw it. Would have been nice if the waitress mentioned something in addition to the big bold letters. 

Overall, nice restaurant with good food and vibe but not sure I would go back since it is pretty expensive."}
{"text":"First time I ate at the restaurant.  Staff did not know their own menu. They were slow and untrained. 
I figured maybe it is because it is a fairly new restaurant.  I decided to give them another chance for take out...
Staff were rude and still not trained. I did a pick up order and they over charged me for 3 items.  Two of the prices were different on the take out menu than the in restaurant menu. Another item is listed twice with 2 different prices.  Staff argued that I was wrong until I went to my car and got the brochure they sent out. With the 2 sets of prices in front of their eyes - they still argued with me. Eventually they got a managers approval to refund the difference to the lower price - but did not refund the tax on the difference. 
Food was bland and boring. 
I will never return."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. 

If you are considering eating here and its a toss up between here and somewhere else in the area, GO HERE. I was curious about this place and after trying it for the first time today I can honestly say that I cannot wait to go back and try more things! My mom and I ordered a few meatless dishes and we did not for a second miss the meat. Everything was SO flavorful! Service and atmosphere were also on point. 

Only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the no tipping policy. The server explained why their system is fair and while I understand the system and acknowledge that it is technically fair, I myself am a server and so I would have liked to have been able to leave extra if I wanted to. 

Apart from that though, excellent restaurant. I am excited to bring my boyfriend...and just about everyone else I know who appreciates good food. Don't sleep on this place. It's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"THE BEST restaurant in Thornhill!! Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious and is of the highest quality. The waiters are so courteous and are more than willing to explain anything on the menu you're not familiar with. I promise you, you won't regret coming here. Although everything is amazing, I recommend the Courgette Fritters, the Organic Chicken Shawarma board, and the Hummus! 
UPDATE: the Fat Beet restaurant website now says 'NOW CLOSED' so I believe it has gone under... Very sad news, it was one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"A really good try - interesting food.  The shawarma was good, the Brussels sprout salad was good.  The way the restaurant serves, by design was not great for me.  They don't have the concept of timing to have everyone's food come out at the same time - if it's just two of you that's fine but we were four people so as they bring out the food that was ready, it sat at the table and got cold because I genuinely felt awkward eating while our friends just watched.  Frankly, it's not a good policy. The wait staff were polite.  They really need to watch the door as they accidentally let in kids selling chocolate bars table to table - gutsy kids, I have to give them credit.  I thought the food was good and the service was attentive but the food delivery style was an issue."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Thornhill.  We have had a number of different dishes. My elderly parents love the rack of lamb. My mother says the french fries (which are flavored with sumac) are the best she has ever had.  Vegetarian offerings are great and salads are very fresh.  We haven't done the all you can eat option because we are not huge eaters but I think it would be a great option.  Servers are very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Not sure exactly how to describe the genre of the food, maybe modern middle eastern/Indian fusion. Definitely a good choice for vegetarians and some amazing sounding meat dishes too (that I didn't get to try).

We ordered 5 veggie and share plates to split between two people and we were stuffed and took home a bunch of leftovers. I really like the courgette fritters, roasted cauliflower, and okra. The only disappointing part was that some of the menu items we wanted weren't available - it seemed like quite a few dishes/juices/cocktails weren't available.

Decor was modern rustic, wood tables with white napkins. Service was good, not too intrusive but prompt and knowledgable about the menu."}
{"text":"Basically an upscaled/midscaled Middle Eastern restaurant, where although the food is tasty, most of your dollars are going towards the comfortable dining seating/tables. We had the butter chicken thali, chicken shwarma, and an appetizer (which I currently can't remember). Portions for the butter chicken thali are a bit small, but service is OK. Am glad to have given it a try, but nothing really stands out in my mind..."}
{"text":"So I've been there a couple of times now. The second time I was invited because I don't think I would ever return willingly.

The place is confusing as hell, it's supposed to be an Indian restaurant but there is nothing in the restaurant about it that's Indian until you smell the food.

I get it, they are trying to reflect India in its new modern era but the dilution of the culture in the decor really moved me away from \"feeling like Indian food\". By the time I got the menu I was in the mood for a veal sandwich, not Indian food. Its like ordering a burger from a Chinese restaurant.

Welcome drink of mango lassi is a nice touch but best kept to the end of the meal, but then having a server pour it in front of you from a reused plastic jug which was probably a juice jug 100 washes ago was not appealing, that needs to stay in the back kitchen.

Finally when we got the menus, it was a big debate. I really couldn't decide what to get, the \"bowl\" concept still confuses me. Their mains were all called bowls and some bowls where Pittas, some were salads and some were curries. So they were not actually bowls, which actually tricked me thinking a bowl would be a healthier alternative to a regular curry dish.

The food is actually not bad once you get it, but normally follows with regret and loathing since after you get it, you realize all you got was Indian food you can get elsewhere for half the price and time ..."}
{"text":"The food is good, but if you are ordering from Justeat they charge an extra $3 as delivery fee. As per the delivery guy, he doesn't get this fee paid to him. He then asks for tips for delivery. Feels weird when something like this happens when you already have paid the delivery fees. Called the restaurant, they blamed it on justeat as to why they charge an extra $3 as \"Delivery Fee\". Also happened to see the price difference on justeat and UberEATS. Not sure why."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff. Different and innovative menu. The best dish on the menu: Chicken shawarma board and turkish kabab skewars."}
{"text":"I love this place 
Food: probably the best i have been to i have been here 4 times already in the last 2 weeks and i have never been disappointed
Service: every single person that i have met in my 4 visits was so kind and friendly top notch service for sure 
Ambience and decor is really nice as well one thing i really love is the cart they have in the middle of the restaurant.
Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try something new and is interested in indian, middle eastern and Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The Roasted Cauliflower on Pico was still very delicious actually because it was so light and contained all vegetables.  I felt good eating it too.  The house salad was so fresh and juicy!

The fries were firm and dense potato fries that were actually really good.

I already know I will be coming back to The Fat Beet.  I want to try out their other dishes!"}
{"text":"So exciting to have a delicious new restaurant in the neighbourhood. Big fan of Amaya and now we have something close to home too! 

Service was great and so was the food:)"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a change from  our usual spots. Decor was nice but they had no window covering and at first it felt very hot inside and too bright. Our table away from window was better. Menu was different shall i say than the usual PB.  We ordered two different platters to share- one was a chicken shwarma on a board, but they had no board, and the other was a whole chicken cut up with watermelon deep fried with a small biscuit and a small cup of maple bourbon sauce. Both very tasty and different, as my mother would say.  We were 4 people and we all shared.  We asked for more lavender pita and we received it. Forgot to mention the yogourt welcome drinks upon arrival not bad for yogourt lovers. Some of got nice cold water and some got lukewarm- oh well.  Will try again probably.  There is a no tipping policy but they do add a 12 % admin tax to the bill to cover tips"}
{"text":"So happy to discover a new spot in the area.  There was a good variety of salads, bowls, appetizers, and main dishes to choose from on the menu.  As a picky eater, the restaurant was vegetarian friendly and had several healthier options.  The menu is also sharing-friendly so my friend and I got to try a few dishes!  I definitely recommend the quinoa onion rings :)  They also give you a mini mango shake when you sit down which was a nice touch.
The tip is included which I thought was an interesting approach."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from just-eat.ca 

A tad expensive but you truly get what you pay for here. Everything tastes fresh made with quality ingredients. I highly recommend the Turkish lamb skewers, the organic chicken shawarma plate, and the ratatouille (first time trying it!). Delivery and take out available. Great customer service all around."}
{"text":"Wasn't blown away by the quality of the food. I got chicken meatballs in a pita and my bf got organic chicken shawarma. Chicken meatballs in a pita only had 3 small pieces of chicken and a salad in it. The bread was stale (I believe it was just old), so I couldn't even chew it and just ate the chicken and the salad separately. Organic chicken shawarma was small pieces of chicken with a salad and bread on the side (same stale bread). We also got some pickles, but none of us could eat them as they were very spicy and had a very specific taste, and didn't taste like traditional pickles at all. 
The portions are very small and I felt quite hungry after I finished my meal. I liked the sauces they gave us in the side though. I kinda felt disappointed because for the money that we paid we could've gotten much better food. 
2.5 stars but I'm giving them three hoping they will improve."}
{"text":"What a welcome change in the Thornhill area! Delicious food and excellent attentive service. My party of 4 ordered a variety of dishes. Each one excellent! The head chef made a personal appearance at the start of our meal to tell us a little about the menu and again when the food arrived. Not to miss!"}
{"text":"A refreshing & eclectic menu with a modern atmosphere.  The Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean fusion of flavours was unexpected yet delicious!  Highly recommend the chicken shawarma, the roasted cauliflower & the okra."}
{"text":"So I came back for a second chance to make it right. 

We came a party of 8 people and things were explosive. The food was great. Service was not rushed at all so be prepared if you are hungry. 

At the end we all at well. The food was good.

So at least this place has dinner going here a lot better. 

Great job."}
{"text":"Ate here last week and the food was fantastic. It's sort of a middle-eastern, indian fusion-type place. I had the lamb thali and not only was there a ton of food, it was all absolutely delicious.  The lamb itself was really tender and not at all gristly, like you sometimes get in curries, and the spicing in the whole dish was really well done and a little bit different from your average curries. The service was great and it's been really well decorated. My only complaint was that my dad's meal (Halibut, and also really delicious) came about 10 minutes before the other dishes. It's a little hard to find as it's in the first floor of a condo that faces away from Yonge so If you're not from the area it might be a bit hard to find, but it's definitely worth looking for."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing...
The decor of this restaurant is on point. The food on the other hand.. was very mediocre. It's fusion middle eastern food, but we found everything being very bland. And for the price point, I personally would rather go to an authentic restaurant. 
I would not recommend if you are looking for authentic Indian food. But recommend this place for its drinks and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Interesting and varied menu. Unique taste. Fresh made food, with good portions.

This new restaurant is setup where Indian Kitchen used to be, and they did a great job updating the space. Very clean and modern. The only thing missing are blinds to block the sun. Half the tables at sundown can be quite blinding right now.

The menu is definitely a smorgasbord of Mediterranean and Indian flavours that marry well. I split a mung bean salad,  courgette fritters, and a chicken shwarma board. I hadn't had mung beans before but they had a great texture. A mix between a lentil and a grain. The courgette fritters were fresh. Soft on the inside, crunchy on the exterior. The chicken shwarma board came with a variety of delicious sauces and toppings which made it a delicious mess to eat. It was definitely an elevated chicken shwarma compared to your regular shwarma place. Their pita bread is good and is more of a mix of naan and pita.

I tried some of someone's short rib and it was cooked well. Definitely had a melt in your mouth feel that you want. Though might have had too much big fatty pieces on it. The cauliflower dish with the puree was delicious. Though the eggplant might have been missing something and was more just a spicy eggplant dish...  Overall the portions were good and reflected the price.

Definitely would go back. Everyone who I ate with said the same thing. Just remember that the food comes as it is prepared. Not all at once."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Excellent vegetarian dishes and good for the meat eaters too. The Beef short ribs are super tender, just like they should be. Mango Lassi or a beer goes down very well here. The Ratatouille is the best I've had in the GTA."}
{"text":"Food was good, the location is hard to find, the decor is nice and simple, and the employees are so nice. 

Location :

In the first floor of a condo at Yonge and Clarke. You can't see it from the street and have to be going there specifically. You probably won't be accidentally wandering to it.

Getting there:

Just north of the chaos that is Yonge and Steeles. Crazy during rush hour but fine on the weekend. A teeny walk from the viva stop. 

Parking situation:

An older condo in the suburbs? Lousy with parking spaces! Go on and drive. 

Decor: 
The space is really big. I've lived in the area so long I sometimes forget what it feels like not to have tables so close you are practically eating with your neighbours. 

Tables and couple of booth/ bench chair hybrids. They have pillows. Good for groups. 

There's no window coverings. We had started dinner in the glorious shade then we ended up sweating up a storm when the sun was setting. Not at all good. Dudes, get shades or something. You had 4 tables of sweating patrons. 

Simple and a bit sparse would be a good description.

Menu:

Not as extensive as I thought. Good choices though. Not quite something for everyone but something for a lot of people. 

Food:

Delicious. They do a great job. 

You get a welcome shot of fermented yogurt.  Yum

There were two of us and we ordered three items to share so we could try a lot.  We got stuff in pitas, which I normally hate, but i really liked. We tried the chicken, the lamb, and a potato pita.  They were all good. I thought the chicken would be my favourite, nope the potato was.  The lamb was good. I'm not normally a big lamb lover, but it didn't taste too lamb like. woo. 

The pitas come with a side of fries or a salad.

Ok, the fries - delicious Not enough on the plate for how wonderful they were.  The salad was nice and fresh too.

What I thought
It's a nice place to bring someone for if you aren't very hungry but in the mood for something fresh and delicious.

Oh yeah - THE TIP IS INCLUDED IN THE COST, so no tipping please - yay."}
