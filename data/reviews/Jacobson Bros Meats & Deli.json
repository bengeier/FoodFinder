{"text":"I went to Jacobson's for years to get standing rib roast for Christmas dinner.  It was always fabulous.  Last year, I picked up the roast, prepared as usual, and it was dreadful.  Full of gristle, didn't taste good, etc.  My guests struggled to pretend it was good and tried to keep cutting it.

When I called to complain, I was told they had a lot of lower grade roasts left and \"had to get rid of it\" so I got one of them.  I am quoting them exactly.  When I complained to the owner, there was never a response.  Make sure if you're going to use them that you insist on prime+ or you'll get something else if they \"have to get rid of it.\""}
{"text":"Jacobson's is a great spot for some deli favs. The potato salad is apparently a go-to; last time I went I encountered a 8.5x11 hand written note posted on the entry door apologizing they were out of the potato salad. Bummer. Brats were great!"}
{"text":"Great Deli. House-made products, local products, fresh food, great prices.  I usually get the entrée with 2 sides and a drink for $6-$7.  Generously portioned, and tastes just like Mom made it.  Prepared meats for cooking at home are awesome. 4 stars because post-lunch-rush items can be dry."}
{"text":"Good meat but very pricey. They're snobby, too. I asked for skirt steak once and the guy behind the counter looked at his coworker and smirked. \"Maybe you should try Milwaukee,\" he said. I felt dumb for asking then went ahead and made a purchase of their overpriced ribeye anyway. Great potato salad."}
{"text":"There is nothing like high quality European bratwurst and in July during my visit to Brookfield to visit my family I picked up some Jacobson Bros brats and accidently forgot they were in the freezer. Well, today, four months later, after not knowing what to make for dinner, I discovered them and after thawing them out and letting them marinade in beer threw them on the grill and served them with some fresh sautéed vegetables. Man, these Jacobson Bros brats had such excellent flavour and are nothing like what they sell here in the south. 

The blend of herbs used were excellent. This is the first time that I ever tried them and will definitely pick up some next summer when I come to Brookfield and visit Brennan's Country Farm Market, which is where I purchased them.

These brats are also extremely reasonable in price, considering that 4 were just $5.29.

{"text":"I absolutely love their potato salad. The problem I have is the staff. Every time I walk in they make me feel like I am bothering them.They are very rude(usually the young cashier is nice) The butcher is extremely rude."}
{"text":"Jacobson Bros Meats and Deli is located at the entrance to our neighborhood. A few neighborhood friends had recommended it, especially their meat. So, one day, as we were out for a walk we stopped in. There is so much more then meat. Even in its small location, I could have wondered for much longer then my 18 month old allowed. There are local cheeses, wines, bakery items, almost anything you could be looking for. They even have a small selection of produce, making this a one stop shop on your way home from work. I ordered the pulled turkey. Very very moist. Just meat, no heavy gravy. I also bought buns. They were large and fresh, overall, a great meal. I will be back, especially for the wine!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a side from the deli for lunch. Ordered a half pound of 8 layer salad for at total price of $2.10. I went to the counter to pay, as I pulled my credit card out the employee saw I had singles in my money clip. He stated \"it's $2.10 but it's gotta be cash.\" I should have left and let him keep the product by I ended up paying by cash. I realize it's a business right to require a minimum amount for a credit card transaction, however I did not see any signs indicating this nor did the staff member say there was a minimum amount required.  It also appears he did not collect sales tax as the total amount was $2.10, and that is what he charged me. Maybe the state should look into their business practices. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Under new management and it shows! Great new selections, daily hot bar deli and prompt, amazing service. If you haven't been here, GO! Fresh and can be cut to order and prices are competitive to any local store. If you have been in the past, you may want to check out the new offerings...It is bringing back old school delis! PS. The Jacobson potato salad is the best we have ever had!"}
{"text":"New management really cares and it shows. If they let you down in the past, like they did me, give the new crew a chance!"}
{"text":"Love getting fresh baby back ribs here. They have delicious potato salad and Cole slaw. The service is friendly and they have a good selection of meats. It's a great butcher shop."}
{"text":"Yep, pricier than Roundy's, but higher quality as well as great support for a smaller market. 

I like to buy all of my tailgating items here, from the potato salad to the freshly made brats and Italian sausage. The favors are great and worth the extra buck or two you might be spending here. 

I've also snagged a few of their prepackaged items, like the bacon wrapped, stuffed chicken breasts, and they're pretty good about providing recommendation on how to prepare them. 

Also, dog bones, big and small. My little devastator loves them."}
{"text":"Great butcher. The meat is always fresh, nice small supply of vegetables, decent hours, friendly staff. I would rate the meat here above any other place in the area.

It was a 5 star but I went to buy some lamb and they had none at all. To me a decent butcher should always carry a variety of meat including lamb."}
{"text":"Amazing looking deli. My one beef (get it? HAW HAW) is that they offer sandwiches made to order, but had no greens to put on it. If they had sprouts and cucumber, I'd get a sammy here regularly."}
{"text":"The meat is solid here and so are some of the salads I've tried.  My only complaint is about the service.  Some of the older workers seem irritated to have to deal with customers here.  Plus turn off the Fox News and television in general.  It adds to the feeling that you'd rather be watching Fox News than getting my meat and providing decent customer service.  Not all service experiences have been bad.  Most of the high school kids are fine."}
