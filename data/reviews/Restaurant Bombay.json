{"text":"This was THE WORST take out / delivery I've ordered, of any cuisine, ever.  Large amount of food, some inedible.  Most things were completely bland, some had more oil than any other single ingredient. The korma was OK, and rice was OK. to be fair."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup la cuisine indienne et ce restaurant (à la carte, pas buffet) propose les classiques du genre de belle façon. L'ambiance est plutôt intimiste (assez petit comme restaurant) et c'est un bel endroit pour un souper à deux. Un peu cher, mais pas assez pour ne pas vouloir y retourner régulièrement."}
{"text":"This place makes my favorite butter curry of any Indian restaurant I've ever visited!  I'm don't live in Montreal, but the last time I was there I even flew some of the food home in my luggage.  It's definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food is good, i tried the Vindaloo chicken and it was excellent. The service is very good. If you're in the quartier latin area this is a good bet to eat at this restaurant. I put 3 stars because i know better indian restaurant in Montreal but this restaurant is good if you're in this area and want to eat indian foods don't hesitate !  Ce restaurant est bon, j'ai mangé le poulet vindaloo et c'était bon, le service est très bon. J'ai mis 3 étoiles parce que je connais de meilleurs resto indiens à Montréal. Mais si vous avez le goût de mets indiens et que vous êtes dans le seteur quartier latin n'hésitez pas !"}
{"text":"great food and nice people! Miraz is a great host!"}
{"text":"Lamb Balti had big hunks of tomato, onion, and green pepper - the lamb was OK (not fatty) but lacked texture.  The peas in the mattar paneer were shriveled.   A tasteless meal - the chapati was the best thing but even here you should hope to find better,"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a weekday night. It was a small restaurant, sort of hidden underneath the street, but we were lured in by the temptation of spicy Indian food. After we sat down, we were given menus and complimentary roti.   We ordered three dishes, one coconut curry, one veggie curry and one mutter paneer. All of the dishes were delish, but the mutter paneer was not my favourite. We ordered three orders of garlic naan instead of rice, cuz I like my curries thick with bread and not rice. The curries were not as thick as I like them, but they were very flavourful. The garlic naan was very doughy, kind of like bread that hadn't been cooked all the way with chunks of garlic baked into it. It was still really good, just not what I am used to, and not what I had expected.  The dishes were all about $12/each, I think the meat dishes were closer to $15, but I could be wrong. Our total bill was about $60 after tax and tip for three of us, and that includes the tea the boys had after dinner. If I was in Montreal again, I would probably visit again, but probably skip the mutter paneer."}
