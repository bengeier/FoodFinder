{"text":"great restaurant were you can bring your own wine and have a 5 stars meal (fine cuisine). I love those match stick French fries."}
{"text":"Même si je ne suis pas un grand fan des resto lavallois (ça doit être mes racines montréalaises), ce resto m'a agréablement surpris. Cuisine française de qualité et service sympathique dans un jolie coin de Laval. Cependant, c'est un peu chère donc je n'y retournerais pas règulièrementcar nous sommes gâtés à Montréal en bistro et cuisine françaises."}
{"text":"This is a family run restaurant in Laval.  The best parts were that it is a bring your own wine restaurant and the service was good.  Other than that the food was not good and was especially expensive considering the quality of the food.  The portions were good, but the food was not good. The fish of the day was overcooked so that it was very dry and the sauce that went with it was horrible.  Also, they did not get the order right for the sides.  Not a good experience.  Others at the table were equally unimpressed with their meals.  

Also, it took a long time for our meals to come out to the table.

All this for a $50 per person meal.  There are much better options available at any price."}

{"text":"Great BYOW! The food is delicious! My boyfriend and i always want to go back just for their Scallop Nanami, it tastes so damn good.  You can have the scallops as an appetizer or as a main dish. Last time we were there which was last saturday, i took the table d'hôte for 15$ additionnal. It includes a soup or salad with an appetizer of your choice ( some of the appetizers, you have to pay extra$$), i chose the salmon tartare and you can have it either spicy or not, i chose spicy. Honestly it was one of the best tartares i've ever had. For the main dish i took the pork filet which was so tasty and my boyfriend took the scallops for his main dish. He loved it. We both were so satisfied with our choices. For dessert, i had the apple caramel cheesecake and it was very good as well. I really recommend this restaurant. It's in a house with two floors, not noisy and very cozy."}
