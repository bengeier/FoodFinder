{"text":"Tonight was the first time we ordered from wongs and the food tastes as nasty as the name!!! Anyone who says that they have good food must habe been raused on ramen noodles because not only did this food make me and my two kids ill, but it wad also garbage quality! We had two bites of our meal before throwing it back in the box. I got ill almost instantly and when I called them, there \"manager\" was so rude and unprofessional, he told me that I need to go to the hospital and have the food tested and bring a doctors note to prove there fiod made us sick.  The quality of food is disgusting, as is the service. I should have listened to my instinct and not gotten food their as they are oporating out of an old building that was previously condemned!!! Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from New York, and spend my summers in Vegas.  Needless to say this has made me very picky when it comes to Asian cuisine.  This is easily the best inexpensive Chinese food I have ever had.  I normally get the same thing, but I have branched out here and there and have never been disappointed.    It's very unassuming and unfortunately not visible from Grand, so I am worried about it's survival.  That's why I decided to write my very first review singing it's praises.  The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, and as I've said the food is fantastic.  Almost everytime I go in I get the House Chicken lunch special and an order of potstickers.  Both are incredible and I highly recommend them.  Please try this place out as soon as possible, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered BBQ ribs and there was no sauce on the ribs, my rice was stale and the sesame chicken was equivalent to a wet soggy puffy chicken nugget....NEVER AGAIN!!!!! We called to let them know and they not accept responsibility or accountability. Order Hungry Howie's instead."}
{"text":"Better than Panda Express and cheaper than Pei Wei!!!   I have turned everyone in my family on to this place and all of my friends to Wong's Jr. I discovered them a few years ago when they first opened and I got a door hanger with their delivery menu as well as coupons! Call me a sucker for free egg rolls, but that was the coupon the hooked me in to ordering. Three years later I am still hooked on the food.   The sweet and sour pork/chicken is cooked to a crispy golden brown perfection. When you order them to go (delivery or pick-up) they pack them in the container minus the sauce. The only complaint that I have is that I wish that they would pack more of the veggie mix (carrots, onions, etc.) inside of the container. I believe that the sauce is made fresh because there have a few times were the sauce was either a little more sweet or sour than the previous experience.   The egg rolls are made fresh and again, they can vary from visit to visit in flavor, but they are always yummy. The Egg Flower soup is the perfect pick me up on a cold day, when you're feeling down, or just because you want something light and filling. More than once, I have had a container of soup and a bag of fried won ton chips for dinner, and been perfectly happy.  It's a little off the beaten path and you have to look for the place in order not pass it up, but it is TOTALLY worth the effort."}
{"text":"Got take out tonight. Wow this place is the worst Chinese food I have ever had! Ordered Vegetable Crispy Chow Mien which turned out to be a box of spouts and celery with a handful of Crispy Noodles from a can. Also asked for extra spicy Orange Chicken which was very runny and all breading. I think the only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and stale fortune cookie. I don't recommend this place to anyone. (I don't like Panda Express either, so don't think I am that type of food person.)  BTW... My fortune cookie taught me \"ce sou\" which is Chinese for RESTROOM and is where I will be after trying this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have ordered take out from Wongs 3 times and each time it's been really good.  I've definitely had better Chinese food but this place always satisfies my chinese craving.  We order the same thing every time.   Egg Rolls Crab Puffs Vegetable LoMein General Tso's Chicken  The Egg Rolls are my least favorite.  But they are still good...the outer layer is too thick for me.  The inside is good though.  Good flavor. Crab puffs are really good.  There's nothing amazing about them but there isn't much to crab puffs so they are what they are.  They're crispy and well cooked. Vegetable LoMein is awesome.  The noodles are always perfectly cooked and the flavors are great.  The vegetables always seem fresh and taste good.   General Tso's is a good flavor.  The chicken is lightly breaded and cooked well.  The only thing I would add is a little spice.  It's very mild.    It's not the best chinese but it's the best I've found in this area.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Nice place, clean, friendly greeting.  Lunch specials were good. Pretty standard stuff. Egg soup was a bit boring, but I'm not a fan of egg soup. Crab puff and eggroll and fried rice were the sides and all were good. Main courses were large enough that we both had more than we could finish.  Good selection of dishes and they serve beer too."}
{"text":"Pretty good and fast service..I would have gave it 4 stars but the location kind of sucks. There is a $15 miminum order for delivery. Good food overall, no complaints!"}
{"text":"Shitty location, hard to find.   Rough being right down the road from big heng but they make it work  A+ food every dish I have had was very good. Polite waiters and clean inside. My only complaint is that the water and tea is really really gross. Im not sure why.   Overall I love it though"}
{"text":"Bad food no flavor at all... Very disappointedAnd very Expensive... For cold  flavorless food. Think twice before ordering from here.."}
{"text":"Love a good quick lunch something other than panda.. Food is always fresh & have never had a complaint. I'm a creature of habit but I do love the hot & sour soup & the spicy Kung pao chicken & shrimp. Priced very well for lunch. Do not prefer the dinner pricing however, delivery is always quick & good & am able to relax.."}
{"text":"Good chinese delivery.  Wonton soup was great.  Rice / chicken / sauce : pretty good stuff, nothing fantastic or awful to speak of"}
{"text":"Good, clean, neighborhood Chinese restaurant. Food is always cooked well, service is great and the place always looks very clean. I find the food better than big heng and Bo Bo china which are also by my house."}
{"text":"This place is literally the only place my boyfriend and I order from for Chinese food.  We probably get delivery from Wongs once a week, and the delivery guy remembers us every time!  There was a weekend we didn't order because we were out of town.  The next weekend when we did order, the delivery guy said, \"we didn't hear from you guys last weekend!\"  Haha!  They're always really fast; 20 minutes from the time we call to the time they're at the door is average.  Always!  The food here is amazing.  I would figure that their prices should be way more considering the AMOUNT of food you get.  We always have leftovers (and everyone knows leftover chinese is even better the next day.)  I'm also a very picky eater and they've never given me grief when I've asked for substitutions, nor have they ever messed up an order.  Plus, they'll give you complimentary egg rolls!  As far as the restaurant itself goes?  It's ghetto looking on the outside!  Last time we drove by there was graffiti on it I believe.  They're slowly but surely making it look more maintained (working neon signs, signs in their windows, etc.) but, whew.  Don't let that hold you back.  You step inside and it's got a flat screen TV usually with some sports event on.  Many tables/booths.  They also sell home made jewlery in the restaurant which is different.  Very clean and maintained.  Professional and friendly staff.  They also serve alcohol in the restaurant!  So, yes...love Wongs."}
{"text":"Love Wongs Jr.! The food is great, portions are great and the price is just right! We love their spring rolls and crab puffs!!"}
{"text":"Get Delivery about 2 times a week always hot n fresh. great flavors great service, really fast delivery to. I live in a gated apartment complex and there is never any trouble. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for familiar fast asain style food. great egg rolls,pot stickers and love the shrimp lo mein!!!   Tim"}
{"text":"We went there again tonight ....as usual EVERYTHING was great . We each had a dinner combo + side I should have just stuck with the side as the portions were huge ...I should have know better as we eat there at least twice a month  One of the reasons is besides great  food they don't mind substitutions as we don't eat any seafood or peanuts ...no problem"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Our fried rice was burnt. Egg rolls were soggy and undercooked. The chicken was slimy. This place is disgusting.  We have ordered twice and both times it was the same way. Do not waste your money on bad Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food here is kinda mediocre. Not horrible but just kinda blah. The thing that bothers me is that I have ordered from here several times and they never get my order right. Not the wrong items. It's just never prepared right. If you ask for extra spicy than that's what you should get. Every time. Why allow people to customize their orders if you never prepare the food as asked. They always seem very nice but obviously just don't care. Too bad."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  Pretty standard Chinese takeout fare but the food is consistently well prepared and the staff is always friendly.  Delivery time isn't very consistent(as quick as 15 minutes to as long as an hour), but it seems like they wait to get your order together until they've got a driver ready.  Never cold or seems as if it's been sitting around."}
{"text":"I'm not sure of the address, but it's right next to Taco Bell on 83rd and Peoria, across from what used to be the old Wal Mart.    This place has been an abandoned Mexican restaurant for the past 4 years, and we just recently noticed signs of life in the form of scrubbing off the graffiti and replacing the awnings.  Last weekend, the boards finally came off the windows and a sign went up to unveil... a Chinese restaurant!    While the name reminds me of something that is decidedly not food, the food inside is pretty solid.  I went there for take out, ordered their version of General Tsos, and got enough food to fill me up for both lunch and dinner that day, and they even threw in a free eggroll! (Might just have been a grand opening special though.)  The chicken was quality (not always the case at Chinese restaurants) and the sauce was good, but not that hot. My only complaint was that they had the weak mustard for the eggroll - I like the stuff that clears out your sinuses.  Maybe if you eat there you get the good stuff.  I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it, but I'm happy they are so close to my house... finally a much better option than Panda!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have gotten take out at least 3 or 4 times from this place so far. The food is great and the staff is so friendly. They always give me a few egg rolls free too, which is really nice. The vegetables and meat are always fresh. The fried rice is great. They are also fast! I usually call ahead and can get my food within 10-15 minutes. The combo deals are inexpensive and you get a lot of food.  As for some of the negative reviews, I don't know what you are talking about! Besides, if you have a problem dealing with someone's accent maybe you shouldn't order Chinese food. :) Just a thought."}
{"text":"Too bad the food is good because we will never go again. They are rude, mean and horrible. The guy who was there was terrible to his employee in front of us and my brother had to say something. We will never eat there again because of his horrible attitude. He was more concerned about the people on the phone then with our order. People who ordered the food after us got their food first! Wth?!"}
{"text":"Really bad Chinese food. I ordered egg rolls, kung pao chicken and shrimp chow fun Everything was really bland, not even lots of soy sauce made it better. Nothing tasted bad, it just didn't have any flavor. The noodles were greasy, and had a weird texture. The filling on the egg rolls did as well.   The delivery was prompt, and the delivery driver was polite, but the food was so bad, I wouldn't order from Wong Jr's again."}
{"text":"Went at noon and  the entire restaurant was empty.  Place looked deserted, but we were greeted rather quickly by a nice woman who showed us to our seat.   I ordered spicy orange chicken. It came out  quickly, but that's kind of expected when there's no other patrons. The food was extremely bland.  In fact, I ate only 3 bites and couldn't bring myself to eat anymore.   Needless to say, I won't be recommending this place to anyone anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Chinese food in general, but this place is just not very good. My wife, who loves Chinese food herself agreed that my Teriyaki Chicken was not made properly. It was tasteless and such a waste of food as I threw away more than half of it. They do give you large portions here, but the food is not good enough for that to matter. I wouldn't recommend this place and don't think I will order from here again."}
{"text":"So I usually love this place & recommend it to everyone. Not anymore! THEY FUCKED UP! It was delivery. There was a piece of metal like from a steel wool scrubber in the garlic sauce chicken and the wings my brother in law had were so bad he spit them out! He said they smelt like BUTTHOLE. Wayne the manager said \"oh yeah that happens we clean with those\" as if it's a normal thing and metal is usually in the food. The wings he said others had ate them in the restaurant and nothing was wrong with their order as if we were making it up. I could've had a stomach lesion or ulcer from swallowing the metal. Luckily, I felt it before I spit it out. My brother in law is not a picky man so for him to spit it out that means bad business. They should've thrown those wings out. It was old meat! They wanted to give me a CREDIT for the garlic sauce chicken only NOT the wings! I told Wayne we were too grossed out to go back there & wanted a refund. He said no they won't refund it unless we take them the food & I told them why can't the delivery driver come back & he said no it was too busy. NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN! ZERO STARS!"}
{"text":"Moo Goo Gai Pan and three Tsingtao beers! - What could be better!   On several occasions, right after my 12-hour work shifts, I felt like having some Asian food nights! This was the place to be! The service has been fast and efficient! The plentiful amount of food has constantly filled my rather large stomach. The best part of the evening was that I was also able to top it off with some nice tasting, imported Chinese beer (Tsingtao). On one of the occasions I even met Mr. Wong, Jr. himself! (at least I think I spoke with him!) All in all, the last three times I've been to the establishment, the service has been great, the food tasted quite good and I had a great time! The restaurant also has a booming \"To-Go\" business. The clientele were constantly contacting the restaurant staff, ordering their food, and in a few short minutes, were running in and picking up the waiting delicacies.  I enjoyed my visits.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The people that work there are so polite and totally cool at the same time. Dont be fooled by the deserted feeling when you forst walk in, the food is amaizing. I literally come here insted of the Chinese restaurant by my house because their crab puffs are out of this world! Not to mention I usually order Singapore rice noodles and this place is on point. All hail Wong Jr!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Their walnut shrimp is addicting. They are always fast, courteous, and my food is always super fresh. The staff is awesome, always really kind."}
{"text":"I dined in here the other day for lunch and Sad to say but Panda Express is better than what I ate. For $6.50 I had hot and sour soup and it wasn't even spicy.  Spicy orange chicken had barely any flavor on it and not spicy The rice was I don't even know what kind of rice it was but it was kind of spongy , the egg roll  was fine but my food wasn't even hot. Fried wontons tasted like soap.The Dr. Pepper was not even flavorful. Highly disappointed and not worth my money."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, good value, great selection, and super fast delivery (granted I live less than two miles away). Nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Chinese place in the area for lunch. Found this on Yelp & decided to give it a try. I ordered the walnut shrimp and it was fast and delicious."}
{"text":"I normally like to write up a storm. But I'm gonna try my best to keep this brief because time is money, and Wong's Jr. is not worth the money. This restaurant just struck me as cheap. Simple as that. The price itself wasn't too bad; I paid $10 total. But it felt like Wong's Jr. cut every corner imaginable. It was one of the most lackluster Chinese restaurants I have ever been to.  I had Szechuan Vegetables (\"extra spicy\") and Hot and Sour Soup. The Szechuan Vegetables were loaded with \"cheap\" vegetables - water chestnuts, carrots, onions, celery and green peppers. I don't have any problem with any of these vegetables in particular, but it's very telling that they are all \"cheaper\" vegetables. It felt like an insult. Like the restaurant was saying \"Oh, you want vegetables? Sure, let's give you the cheapest vegetables possible!\"   Where was the broccoli or the green beans? Wong's Jr. was too cheap to include them. The sauce was watery and weak. I was hoping for a thicker and more satisfying sauce. Don't get me wrong; it's not like it tasted bad or anything. But it was very unexciting and not worth buying.  Meanwhile, the Hot and Sour Soup was plain and bare bones. Also very unexciting. The White Rice was below average and a poor complement to the main dish. My meal was served to me in a box that was cut in half. Way to cut corners by not having to buy plastic bags!  I could go on about the depressing atmosphere and bash the restaurant some more, but I really don't need to. Wong's Jr. was just very lackluster. The food itself wasn't bad, but quite noticeably below average. Below average simply doesn't cut it in 2016. It might have worked in the past, but with all the amazing food options available today, a restaurant must go above and beyond. This is a disappointment.  For its below average service and food, Wong's Jr. gets 2 stars. It's certainly not the worst restaurant I have ever been to, but I have been to so much better. Wong's Jr. is not worth your time. Avoid."}
{"text":"This place is really good! What sold is on this place is that they offer truly gluten free food that is not twice the price."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, but I just can't say anything good about Wong's Jr.  I ordered Take Out last weekend from here, and I was really hoping this place would be good.  Sad to say, it wasn't.  We had 'Spicy' Orange Chicken, Shrimp Chowmein, and Egg Rolls.  The Chicken wasn't spicy at all.  Whatever kick was in it must have been forgotten to be added.  As for the Chowmein, it was terrible.  Sprouts and celery sitr-fried with a bag of canned crispy noodles.  The Egg Rolls were 'meh' at best, and the rice....well, it was just white rice.  I am not really sure what's going on here, but it appears that people either love this place or hate it.  For those who love it, I wonder if you have ever had really good Chinese before."}
{"text":"Plenty of food for the price! I went for dinner tonight after reading other good reviews. The place was clean and the service was fast and friendly. English was good too.  For my appetizer I ordered the crab puffs. They were really good. Lots of filling and flavor! One of my favorites there for sure. I got six of them for less than three dollars!  I had the dinner combination #7 which included a choice of one entree and came with fried rice, one egg roll, sweet and sour chicken, and choice of soup. I had the egg drop soup.   My dinner came to me in a timely manner and was just what I ordered. I chose the spicy orange chicken for my entree. The orange chicken was just spicy enough, but not too hot to eat. It had a thin breading on it which I really liked. The sweet and sour chicken had a thicker breading which I wasn't too fond of, but tasted good anyway. Next time I'll just get the orange chicken dinner. The fried rice was a brown rice if I'm not mistaken and was kinda plain, without any vegetables or egg so I spiced it up with some soy. The egg roll was a little over done on the outside and full of flavor on the inside.  There are not very many Chinese restaurants to choose between in my area of the valley and most of them are too expensive and lack good flavor. I'll be going back Wong's Jr again many more times in the future for sure! Another favorite would be China Grill. ;)"}
{"text":"Their service is awesome! Delivery guys are personable and polite. They have good coupons and great food!"}
{"text":"I've been eating there since they've opened about 4 years ago. It's in an old Kenny Rogers roasters building.  They're down the street from BoBo.  The food is comparable. They service here is no nonsense and not as friendly as BoBo, but its much larger and they offer Mushu and other dishes not carried by BoBo. They also do carryout and delivery. What I like about Wong Jr, maybe because I'm a regular, they allow me to have the smaller portioned lunch combo and price even when we are a few minutes past the cutoff time. They offer hot and sour soup and no just egg drop on the lunch combo. Which comes with both a egg roll and crab puff.  I call it a mystery crab puff, because I've yet to find any crab, even imitation crab in the cream cheese! My son really likes them and he gladly receives them from his sisters. I like Mushu, but like most Chinese restaurants in town, use the thin flour tortilla style commercial crepe, instead of a fresh made egg crepe. If you don't like an ingredient, or more of one and less of another, or substitute, they will customize you dish.  Sometimes there is a slight charge for the service ($1, but could be more or free)."}
{"text":"I don't know if they read their reviews or not but they should. This was shockingly bad. The teriyaki chicken literally had no sauce.. never seen anything like it.  The house chicken is aptly named because it tasted like drywall.  Zero flavor.  I have no idea how this place is in business."}
{"text":"The service here really good and place very clean. They made me feel very welcome and at home. I really appreciated their hospitality. I would recommend this place. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken didn't taste very fresh... That was chicken right???????..."}
{"text":"My family has come to this restaurants since my kids were little.  Now I bring my grandkids here.  We have never been dissapointed.  Everything from scratch.  Love it.  Wong chicken is awesome spicy or non spicy.  The will cook either way.  Crazy good food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is near my work on the westside.  I stopped in for lunch and was pleased with the prices, portions, and selection on the menu.  I had the Chicken Lo Mein combo which had good flavor and the noodles were cooked well.  Wasn't a huge fan of their fried rice or egg rolls though as both were a tad dry.  I'll try them out again though as I'm always looking for lunch options."}
{"text":"I am so upset with myself for forgetting about this place for so long. Tonight I rediscoved the wonderful flavors of great delivery food. The staff is always friendly and accomodating to my picky needs without compliant or frustration and I appreciate that. My mouth watered from the flavorful chowmain and the crispy fried shrimp I ordered tonight. I was very happy with the food and service as always. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all. The food was cold and stale. The fried rice was burnt, not sure how that is possible, but it was. The crab puffs and soup was actually very good. I was very disappointed and had to ask for money back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Wong's Jr last night for the first time and was surprizingly pleased.  You see, I'm a recent transplant from NY and I'm a bit of a sceptic when it comes to food out here.  I had gotten home late, wasn't thrilled with anything in the house, and didn't feel like going out again, so I decided on take-out.  I had been getting take out menus left on my door for months, so I decided to give it a shot.  They have a very large delivery area.  When I called, as soon as I told them it would be for delivery, they warned me that it may be an hour or so before it got to me.  That actually fit in well to my plans so I still went for it.  I ordered Mongolian Beef, Chicken and Broccoli and Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Everything was absolutely dee-lish!  He even threw in 2 eggrolls!  They gave me plenty of sauces and fortune cookies (sometimes they're a little skimpy on these).  The portions were overflowing from the containers.  Plenty of food for the price.  And... the delivery came in only 45 minutes. The man making the delivery found my apartment with no problems and was very pleasant and very appreciative of my tip.  Will most definately order again!"}
{"text":"We love love love this place!! Always great food and delivery service ty!! Can't wait for our next order . Crab wontons are usually.free with our order to"}
{"text":"Unimpressed, until I tasted the chow fun, this was the flavor I had been looking for.   Beef Chow Fun:  5 stars  Other dishes:  3stars Service: 3 stars  Once I complimented the chow fun they informed me they have fresh noodles delivered from California once a week, and yes - they do run out sometimes."}
{"text":"My wife & I come here at least once a week for lunch. Their lunch specials are our favorite: $5. Iced Tea is good as well. I just had sweet & sour chicken (which was good), but it was overcooked. When Ray is waiting tables, it is much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop in before going to work today... Gotta say that I'm so glad we did!!  Looking at the place from the outside does not prepare you at all for what you get on the inside.  Wongs is very tastefully decorated and so, so clean.  We got nothing but smiles from the prompt and friendly staff... Everyone there was staying busy the entire visit, from spot cleaning to folding menus.  Let's get into what's really important though... The food!!!!  We started our meal with Crab Rangoon and Beef Skewers... Just amazing.  The Rangoon was light and crispy, the filling just right; while the Skewers were juicy and tender with just the right flavor.  After that we both went for dinner combos.  I went for the pepper steak which was served with egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken, an egg roll, and fried rice.  The chicken was delectable, super crispy and flavorful... Pepper steak was just right, fried shrimp was yummy, and fried rice had a great taste.  Egg roll was a bit too cooked for me, but just right for my boyfriend.  The only difference in his combo was the spicy orange chicken which he LOVED.  Neither of us had anything bad at all to say about the soup... In short, best Chinese food I've ever had.  We will be going back very often!!"}
{"text":"As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like \"wha? really? is this IRL?\"   I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden and very quiet, but from the reviews it seems like they've got quite a few patrons! I thought the food was just okay... I've eaten here twice and I admit that the prices are excellent but unfortunately it's not enough to keep me coming back. Staff was pretty friendly, so I thought that was a plus."}
{"text":"Absolutely will NEVER RETURN. The staff pays more attention to each other, speaking in a foreign language, then they do taking my order correctly. Making sure that my order is correct was not a priority to the staff. Living 20 miles away from this restaurant made it a hindrance when I called to complain. The woman on the phone was yelling at me which, is poor customer service. She advised for me to come back to the restaurant, which is 20 miles away, to pick up the items that were missing and what was cooked in correctly. I have never been treated this poorly from a Chinese restaurant. The floor was dirty and the bathrooms were not clean. I did not eat the food since it was cooked incorrectly. This was a waste of money and, a waste of time. Instead of being happy with my food, I am now hungry and angry. This is one customer that will never support their restaurant again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Have eaten there before and food was fine, not stellar. This time I ordered food to go for our fun and non traditional Christmas dinner. I had a issue with my debit card. They didn't accept other forms of payment that I had available, totally understandable. I asked if they could accept a family member debit card over the phone, and start the order while I ran home to get the new card and family member (so they could see it was really a valid card that we legally possessed).  They refused the over the phone card and refused to start the order until I returned with the actual card. I was so annoyed I just walked out.  If I had called from home first, they would have accepted payment that way and started the order. The logic behind making me wait longer when my travel time there and back  baffles me. There would have been plenty of time for the food to be cooked so  I could have just popped in and out without taking up space in their waiting area. And I wouldn't have had to waste any more of my own time."}
{"text":"Twice Cooked Crispy Pork was not crispy or good. Just some soggy breaded pork slathered in too much sauce. Chicken with garlic sauce was bland. Fried rice was just steamed rice covered in soy sauce."}
{"text":"Still lovin the lo mein and sweet and sour pork!! EGG ROLL HEAVEN with the mustard!!!"}
{"text":"Omgosh this place is so so good. The food is delicious! And the staff is so friendly and they honestly appreciate their customers. I've been coming here for the past year, and I've never had a bad experience. Definitely try the spicy orange chicken especially for lunch, they have awesome lunch and dinner specials."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. We haven't been here in several years.  Wong's Jr is still really good. We ordered off of the lunch menu. We ordered the egg flower soup as soup comes with the lunch special.  My husband ordered the Schezwan pork with steamed white rice and I ordered the shrimp with snow peas and steamed white rice. We both had hot green teas as well.  The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The pork was tender. The shrimp was in a thick creamy sauce. The vegetables were crisp. Every bite was like a party in my mouth--it all joined together in a flavorful mix of flavors. The restaurant is clean the restrooms are clean. The waiter and waitress were very prompt and attentive. They were friendly and they removed our dishes promptly.  Parking is plentiful.  We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Two stars for service and cleanliness... The food- two thumbs down.  As soon as I walked in a was greeted by an incredibly kind gentleman, he offered me a menu and I placed my order. All of the people I interacted with were very pleasant and helpful.  The restaurant was very clean and had decent decor. If it were based on service and cleanliness alone, I'd be back for sure. However the food was bland. I had the beef lo mein, my usual choice. Bland, bland, bland. So I took a few bites off my husband's \"spicy\" orange chicken.. It wasn't spicy at all. Again bland, boring, and we probably could have had more flavor from panda. Yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"We ordered take out. They were here within a timely manner. My egg rolls were ok...just tasted old.   The sweet and sour sauce was the worst. I LOVE chinese and love sweet and sour sauce. First off, it smelled like sweet and sour sauce mixed with puke. I'm not kidding. I wouldnt say that to be mean, it is LITERALLY what it smelled like. We liked the crab puffs...just didnt have anything GOOD to dip them in. We both ordered teriyaki combo plates, and pork fried rice as well. Rice was ok...not much flavor. Hub never even got to his teriyaki last night....bad thing is, I did. I had probably about 5 bites before I put it in the fridge for tomorrow. It was the only thing I ate that hub didnt. I was up ALL NIGHT long in the bathroom. Sick as a dog. The teriyaki meals are still in my fridge and I plan to call about it.  ( JUST CALLED THE PLACE) spoke with the manager. I asked for a refund on just my two meals that wouldve totalled less that $15.  My order including tip- I even tipped 8 dollars!- was $38.   I've lived in peoria all 28 years of my life, and order from this place quite frequently. I have never asked for a refund or complained before. Usually they are our GO TO for chinese take out.  Guy said no, beccause people can eat, get full,and then call for refund.    ONe of my meals had like 5 bites taken out of it (that's what got me sick) and hub didnt even touch his yet, he put it in the fridge and was saving it for today......SO I OFFERED to take the food back to them.  He said no again. I asked for higher up and than him and he said there was no higher....just the owner. I asked for the owner's info or to give him my info for contact and he refused!  He said the owner would think it was silly and would laugh at him for not being able to handle it.   I said, ok, then why isnt this handled?   He again refused to take my info and then hung up on me.   I told him I write reviews and would post to the BBB- I wanted to speak with the owner. Im not some cheapy trying to get my money back.  I have a house, two vehicles, and a small business. $15 isnt anything but principal at this point. Your food made someone sick.  I didnt ask for a full refund and I tipped MORE than what is adequate.  I WAS a good customer and now they have lost our business.            Today is mother's day. Last night we ordered take out cause my inlaws just took the kids for the night. It was my relax night....and I ended up in the bathroom all night long- and feeling like crap this morning.     My review and issue is on to the BBB next, and any place else I can post about it.    It's just not right!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! Had the sweet/sour shrimp and my guest tried the sweet/sour pork.  Each came with fried rice, choice of egg drop or hot/sour soup (he got egg drop, I tried the hot/sour, which was fabulous) and a crab puff.  We also ordered appetizers of crab puffs and potstickers.  The crab puffs were really cheesy, but with extra sweet/sour, who cares?!  The potstickers came with a wonderful soy-ish sauce that my guest added to his fried rice.  The overall meal was delicious!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!  The food is always so tasty and the people are pretty nice too. We r always in and out & that's a plus w/ us, b/c we t always STARVING when we go.   We visit often. :)"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover - the outside looks like any other hole in the wall, low-quality, crap place.  The inside is so much different - very cozy and the staff is super nice!  I got the spicy orange chicken lunch combo which came with an egg roll, crab puff, and fried rice, all for just $4.50!  I'm not a huge fan of lots of breading on my meat so I was thrilled that there is a pretty minimal amount of breading on this dish.  My husband ordered the kung pao chicken which came with the same sides.  This was also very tasty and we were both amazed at how fresh and crisp the vegetables were, almost like they add them near the end of the cooking process.  Overall, best Chinese takeout I've ever had and they delivery too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I've ordered takeout a few times since moving here from alifornia, and the food is terrific! Love the sweet n sour pork, Lemon chicken and just about everything we've ordered... and when visiting the restaurant, I found it very clean, the employees cheerful and the beer terrific...lol"}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  ! Wongs Chicken tasted like it was a week old.  Egg fu young had no flavor.  The hot and sour soup was barely OK."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been going to Wong Jr. since it opened & always enjoyed the food, customer service & cleanliness of the restaurant.  Recently we've noticed a change in the taste of their food; bland, just not consistent any longer. Tonight I thought we'd give them another try, unfortunately the egg rolls were greasy & soggy inside, the Singapore rice noodle dish was bland & partially cold. I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"When you need a quick cheap bite this is the place! I love their house fried rice and the Singapore noodles!! Yummmmm super delish!! It's also clean and in a decent area! I have been coming here for years and never have had a problem! Love wongs jr!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the dining experience in the restaurant as my husband and I have only ordered delivery regularly over the last three years.  We have nothing but good things to say, our order is always correct, the prices are reasonable, the food is consistently hot and fresh, and the delivery is fast, even on busy delivery days!  We won't order from anywhere else while Wong's delivers to us."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Ordered from a menu left on my front door, so I wasn't sure what to expect, being as its in the same parking lot as a Taco Bell. Appreciate the vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Last minute decision, tried eat24 and only one Chinese restaurant that I found to be less then good. After a simple google search I found this place so I called, lady on the phone was super friendly so I placed my order with no issues, 2 teriyaki, 1 orange chicken and 2 egg rolls, plus she threw in 2 more no charge. I ordered extra rice because I know typically these places dont give enough, I later learned that was totally not necessary. I barely had enough time to get things set for dinner change for bed and it was here, super quick. Finally I figured everything was going too good however the delivery guy was super friendly and the food was AWESOME, oh and I thought all the rice even the extra was in one large container, no, there was a separate one. I will definitely be ordering from these guys again!"}
{"text":"I celebrate pretty much all special occasions with Chinese food. It's delicious, usually cheap, and there are endless menu options to choose from (although, let's face it, I'll judge you by the quality of your lo mein). So when I first moved to Phoenix, I immediately began a search for delicious Chinese food somewhere near my house.   Believe it or not, it took more than a YEAR to find a place that was't truly awful.  Wong's Jr is a delicious island floating in a desolate sea (desert?) of terrible Chinese food. I tried Chinese places up and down the length of Bell Road, all the way down to Glendale and up to Happy Valley. It took a long time and a lot of heartbreak, but Yelp finally led us to wonderful Wong's Jr - truly, it was love at first taste. The service here is always super friendly, professional, and fast. Their dinner specials are fabulous -  they come with rice, an egg roll, a crab puff, and either sweet and sour chicken or what they call BBQ chicken (it's no bbq I recognize, but it's definitely delicious!). The ton of food they give you is always piping hot, and the quality never varies. Sometimes they'll even throw in free egg rolls, if you order a lot.  I have a hard time straying from the lo mein, and Andy F adores the sesame chicken, but everything else we tried was just as good. This place is a real gem, and one I recommend to everyone disappointed in Phoenix's Chinese food offerings.   Wong's Jr, we miss you already!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time. Was pleasantly surprised. The food was tasty and still hot. Got to us within 40 minutes. They were very polite when taking the order. 4 stars because the sweet and sour sauce given on the side was a little runny for my liking. .  I ordered the beef chop suey combo b. It was very good. Came with fried rice , sweet and sour chicken , egg roll and a fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Hit or miss but I keep coming back - maybe it is the price or the convenience - not sure.  Either way - if you want affordable chinese with generous portion sizes - this place is for you.,"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Chinese take out place. We first ordered because we were lazy. Delivery is fast (they always quote 45 minutes; food arrives in 20-30 minutes). We order once or twice a week, and the food never disappoints. The crab puffs and kung pao are my favorites."}
{"text":"Won't be going here anymore. They got my order wrong and I came back to return it (exchange for my right order since I paid). The manager ephasized I could NEVER do it again and their system logs our information and phone numbers so, if we were to call we wouldn't be allowed a return or exchange. He was rude, said it numerous times over and over how he can't deal with people returning or exchanging the food cause it gets thrown out. Sorry, but I just wanted my CORRECT order and to go home after a long day of work. Talk about crappy  customer service. I normally don't feel the need to write a review as it is my first one, but I'm heavily disappointed since it's a local restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since the week it opened. It is going down in quality. Y last and i mean last order was bitter because the grease was not fresh on fried food. It was delivery but manager made me drive back, and than told me two of the plates were eaten out of, maybe a third, so he only refunded one. We ordered three. For a known and faithful customer i was treated like arbage, and that is how my LAST meal there tasted as well. I still have the nasty after taste in my mouth. Yes, iam upset, but this used to be my favorite place for chinese food, and when it goes fromfavorite to returning food, something is wrong."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food at a good price. Nothing is amazing but good quality food at a decent price. We come here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Went here the other day because I was hungry and saw it a few times since I've drove by it and never got to it. Now I wish I didn't go here. The food was not good. I order sesame chicken with white rice. It was not good and very bland. They serve their food on cheap plates and cups that look like it could be from a hospital. Food was not appealing at all. Once I walked in there was only one person there eating. That should have been a warning for me since the restaurant was kind of big but no costumers expect 1 person.   I will never be returning here again unfortunately. The two stars is for the customer service. Very friend people and the restaurant seemed to be very clean. I will be looking for Chinese food else where."}
{"text":"Couldnt wait to enjoy a great lunch here, the food is always amazing, but my plans for that were abrubtly cut short when a waiter, a white man in his 50s with a grey beard took it upon himself to SHOW ME PORNOGRAPHY on his phone that he thought somehow pertained to a previous conversation about corvettes we had just a few minutes before? IN FRONT OF MY GIRLFRIEND no less. This is absolutely unprofessional behavior and borderline sexual harassment, at no point did i indicate that i wished to see pornographic material from the phone of an employee of wong jrs and insane to assume that is something i care to see at lunch with my girlfriend. My professional advice to management is to fire the employee in question by close of business TODAY."}
{"text":"My delivery order took over 70 minutes to arrive and then the taste was just OK. won't order again. sweet and sour chicken, Teriyaki chicken, chicken egg foo young, eggs rolls. .."}
{"text":"Mundane food, poorly seasoned, long wait for delivery  Being hungry and desiring some comfort food, I was excited to see twice cooked pork. My husband warned me that it wouldn't be right since this was a fast food Chinese place. None the less we ordered it along with Beijing style hot and spicy chicken, BBQ ribs, and Hot and sour soup.  The verdict: Only the steamed rice was edible!  Twice cooked pork is sliced pork that is boiled then stir fried w the sauce. What I got was pork coated in breading then drenched in not spicy sauce with maybe 5 pieces of pepper, 2 pieces of onion, 2 pieces of carrot, and 3 inedible whole chilli peppers. If you're into this type of nonsense, they do pack a full cartoon.  The Beijing style hot and spicy chicken looked just like the pork! Only this sauce was just like an orange sauce and not spicy.  BBQ ribs: They were decent size but lacked BBQ sauce! They had the typically Chinese pink stuff but don't call something BBQ without a proper rub or sauce. They were greasy, but less chewy than others we have tried.   Hot and sour soup: Terrible. Not sour. Not spicy. Tastes bland with no texture whatsoever. I'm beginning to think that Arizona has no good Hot and Sour Soup.  Delivery: Took over an hour for delivery despite living 10 minutes away. In my book, that's unacceptable.  I would not choose to eat from this place ever again. Nor would I ever order any of the items above."}
{"text":"Wong's Jr is inexpensive and the food tastes ok, but I have had better. We got a take out order with Ma Po Tofu and some Almond Chicken. The Ma Po Tofu was strange since there is usually tofu and pork in a spicy sauce at other restaurants but at Wong's Jr there is only tofu and vegetables - it tasted ok but just seemed strange without the pork. Maybe it was their way to keep the dish vegetarian, but not what I expected. The almond chicken was also just ok. There were a bunch of diced vegetables with some pieces of chicken in a watery sauce that had almonds in it. The sauces with the meals were so watery that the takeout boxes became weak and flimsy by the time I drove home. Luckily, everything was double bagged with plastic.   I would get food from there again if I was hungry and didn't feel like anything else since they are cheap and have pretty good hours - open pretty late and everyday including holidays."}
{"text":"Your basic Chinese food, best had via delivery.  The thing is they have good nights (most of the time), and not so good nights (sometimes), so consistency of quality could be better.  Portions and prices are pretty good, though.  They usually get the orders right, but a couple times when they didn't, they just argued and refused to make it right.  the thing I would complain about is if you get chicken ANYTHING, make sure you pay extra for white meat, otherwise you get dark meat and tendons.  I'd recommend them, if you are close by, and need a Chinese food delivery in your area."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Chinese food place within about 5 miles.  The staff is friendly though the best English-speakers in the place are a still a little hard to understand.  The prices, speed and portions are about average and the food is very good.  I actually like the location and styling of the building.  Its right next to a taco bell and looks like it might have used to be a KFC or something.  The building looks better inside and out than almost all Chinese food restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good food, 'specially for the area.  I work down the street and after several co-workers told me how good it was I went for a look see.  If you are eating in there isn't much to get excited about besides the plasma TV on the back wall with ESPN news constantly running with no volume.  There is also no music or other background music, to me it felt a little weird, like I was eating at the library.    The food is very tasty.  Their chicken is all white meat which is very rare for an Asian food establishment, especially when they aren't charging extra for it. The spiciness can be adjusted to taste, from warm to sweat pouring into my eyes hot.   Lunch specials are filling with rice, entree, egg roll, and crab puff.  Dinner portions are sized up and again, very filling. Several vegetarian and health aware items on the menu.   They deliver to a pretty large area, and staff are friendly.  If you work or live in the area, support them as it would be a shame to see them go out of business."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they first opened. The food is ok for the price, but it seems like over time some of the quality went down (only on certain items). I used to eat here 2-3 times a week but I started to cut back after I got a bit burnt out (it's pretty cheap and it takes like 10 mins to be done and I'm home in 3). When I started eating there again (a few months later) I noticed that every 2-3 times I've ordered from there I get sick. I still order from here, but on a much less frequent basis, such as once or twice a month. I just know that there's a chance of getting sick, so I don't eat there as often."}
{"text":"Come here for take out all the time. Never had any bad dishes. I pass several Chinese restaurants to get to Wong's Jr. They are my go to place."}
{"text":"They have the same selections as all the other chinese places...except they all taste better! We have been going here for the last two years and they are consistently awesome! Great food and they always end up giving us free eggrolls with our order. FREE EGGROLLS! I love this place."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Portions are modest and flavor is spot on.  Take out and dine both offer great experiences.  I will agree that the dining in experience is a little quiet, no music no TV's.  This part though I have decided I like.  The staff are very, very friendly.  This resteraunt has become my chinese resteraunt of choice over Changs.  Food is equal if not better, Wait Staff is Friendlier, Price point is unbeatable.    This location will only get better as it ages."}
