{"text":"Cool little Tahitian restaurant by the stadium.  Four of us came here for lunch, and I kept thinking \"these are the prices all the time? not just lunch??\"  It was great to feel you were getting a deal.  I got the coconut jumbo shrimp which turned out to be really, really coconut-y.  You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring it out to you promptly!  Someone else ordered the shrimp curry with the coconut rice and I tried the rice.  Instead of the standard coconut rice that I'm used to, which is rice cooked with coconut milk, this had shredded coconuts in it!  Definitely a good place for people who love coconut!  Two reasons why they lost a star: 1) when we ordered drinks at the counter, they guy automatically gave us disposable cups even though we were eating there; please try to be environmentally friendly! and 2) there were several menu items that came with salsa but apparently they've changed their menu so that it doesn't come with it; please update your menu or when we call you out on it, give it to us anyway!"}
{"text":"Average & basic, yet mostly decent among sadly limited choices in the Westgate City Center.  My hockey loving mom has Coyotes season tickets and I go to games with her usually at least once a week. I enjoy hockey, although I would enjoy it more if it wasn't at 91st Ave. Nothing like an hour drive to get to a game. Why oh why did you have to leave downtown Coyotes?? OK, my anger at the location is sufficiently vented.   So back to Motu's, it is a reasonable and quick alternative to eating in the arena, which we sometimes prefer not to do. I am not a huge doughy pizza or hot dog fan.   I've had a couple decent meals there, and I am a fan of the mango salsa. Although I must confess, I'm a bit of a mango whore. I love almost anything with mangoes. mmmmmmmm    You walk in look at a big menu on the wall, order meal, pay for meal, get cups, get number, grab a free table, get drinks, and get your food delivered. This is basic dining, with options that are a little better than the fast food route.  They lose stars though because last time we went I ordered the mahi mahi, and it was covered in this waaaaayyyyy too spicy goo. I took one bite and my mouth was on fire. I couldn't even taste the actual fish. I used three napkins to try and wipe it off the rest of my fish, and there was still some goo left. I was starving so I forced myself to eat it. I went through three glasses of lemonade just keeping the burning at bay.  Mind you, nowhere on the menu did it indicate this was a spicy dish. My mom's shrimp dish was also full of way too spicy goo at the bottom, so she only at the top part, and she normally enjoys spicy food.  The past two times were ate here before this time everything was normal, so I am judging them on multiple experiences. Plus I am hoping some crazy guy in the kitchen just got out of control with the spicy goo that night!   Bottom line, I wouldn't come here if I wasn't stuck with only the Westgate City Center dining options, but it'll do for now.  If you must eat here, ask them to hold the super spicy goo!!"}
{"text":"I didn't really expect much from this place, but I think that the Ono's and other Hawaiian BBQs have this chain beat. I have to say that they at least saved me from spending way too much money on a light dinner when the rest of the restaurants were crowded and overpriced at WestGate."}
