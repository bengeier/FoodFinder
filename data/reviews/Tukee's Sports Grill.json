{"text":"Great place to watch your favorite game the food is tastey and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. There are far better places than this. They close whenever they feel like it. Most times there is no (mediocre) food available. The servers are friendly but it stops there. Your money is better spent somewhere else like Bleachers."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our kids here on a weeknight.  I must say that I read  the reviews prior to dining here. I was pleasantly surprised!! The service was great, the food tasted fresh. I had a Reuben sandwich. It was really good, not greasy. The french fries were crispy. My husband had their turkey burger and liked it as well.  The staff was friendly and courteous and very accommodating (which is great when you have a 2 and a 4 year old out with you!) We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Lacks service and professionalism (calling my 17 year old babe...inappropriate).  Aside from this the French Dip was sent back and replaced with over fried chicken tenders...gross food and tacky service.! Total overhaul needed!  Great location...nothing else!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a neighborhood place to grab a bite to eat or a beer after a long days work........keep looking.  Average at best, service is terrible.  First time there being a fan of PBR I asked and the waiter said they were out....trusting that he is the one that would know these things I settle for a Kilt lifter on tap which was OK....I look over at the glass refrigerator and low and behold there are several PBR's chilling.  I bring this to his attention and I will admit I got it for free, but we should have left at that point.  The food was very average, microwave quality food. We sat next to the manager and he was obviously too busy to say anything about the mix-ups and I know he heard us. But if customer service isn't his bag then keep on keeping on."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome and had a HUGE selection of food. But after going there last night we were shocked that the menu had drastically changed. Our favorite menu items weren't on the menu. Gone are the bacon burgers and now are the burgers with pears and raspberry jam. This is a sports bar right? Granted you can build your own burger, but you have to pay separately for every topping. I didn't do the math, but felt like if I built my own, it would've ended being an expense burger, so I didn't even bother.  The nachos were a stack of chips with cheese only on the top layer. The jalapeños on the nachos were good and seemed fresh, but that was about it.  I also ordered the Cali Grilled Chicken avocado sandwich. I've eaten this dish here before, as it was on the old menu. Only this time the chicken was really dry.  Needless to say if your in the mood for \"sports bar\" food this is not the place.  As we were eating the band started. The sound system was so loud that we seriously couldn't hear each other, and we were sitting as far away from the band as you could be with still being outside.   After we finished eating we didn't even bother getting another round of beers. We were just so relieved to get out of that place!  Like I said, I really used to love going there for the chill atmosphere and the food. But now I don't see myself ever going back."}
{"text":"Came in to hear the band on friday night and not a single server in sight, was there about an hour and no one ever took our order.  The people next to us said the chicken was really dry.  Horrible service."}
{"text":"First time I went in I was disappointed by the service we received which was back in January. It was actually surprising how rude our waitress was, but it was a busy Friday night so I shrugged it off as a bad evening and not necessarily a bad employee. But returning yesterday, the service was poor in a different way. We were basically ignored for our whole visit except when we got our food (which was pretty speedy so no complaints there). But because it was not busy it was a little frustrating that we had to wait 40 minutes for our check. The waitress was friendly enough, but never checked on us, checked on our waters, or brought us our check until we asked. Probably won't be back again."}
{"text":"First time here. Was pretty busy with Stanley Cup on but even being busy were greeted and seated promptly.  Our waitress was great and checked on us often. we ordered the bone in hot wings and I loved them. I'm a picky wing eater and they were perfect amount of sauce and crisp but tender inside. We ordered the build your own burgers. They were good. Not great but decent. I liked the atmosphere. I want to try them at night and for karaoke."}
{"text":"Ok new menu new staff this place rocks! For all of you who haven't had food or service from this place you are missing out! Live music, sangria Sundays, and an awesome patio! But for those of you that don't believe me go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! What a fun dining experience. There's good bar food, entertainment with the many many TV's, a good beer selection (i love my craft beer), and a courteous and kind wait-staff. The owner, is seriously the man too. Kind to everyone who comes in and truly cares about delivering an amazing and fun experience"}
{"text":"I love this place... Steve the owner is great, he's friendly outgoing, and a true Bears fan!! It's ok, we still like him anyways. The staff is amazing... I have my favorites or I'll just sit at the bar... Tara knows her stuff too, tell her what you're in the mood for and she'll surprise you, and you'll like it too. Their happy hour is amazing and u can't beat the prices!!"}
{"text":"We went here for UFC fight night. At most places on fight night there is standing room only and they dont reserve tables for you. This place is different. If you call ahead they reserve you a table, and they have the awesome burgers and fantastic wings. The service is good, the  wait staff is attentive and it isnt as loud as most sports bars. There are several seating options from the bar to the patio to general seating. The only complaint was that the drinks are not consistently made. One bloody mary may not taste like the next for example. All in all this place is good and we will be going again."}
{"text":"Too bad I cannot give this place less than 1 star. Went last week and left after waiting for 15 minutes for someone, anyone, to acknowledge us.  During that time, at least 6 wait staff walked right on by. Went again tonight to give it another shot. After 20 minutes, we got sodas and menus but nothing else. We want to support our local eateries. And we will...just not this one."}
{"text":"Hmmmm waited 10 minutes just to get a beer and when a server finally brought me one, it was the wrong one. I'm 14 minutes in and I hate this place...."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Tukees since it opened. This place doesn't get the respect it deserves. The employees here are friendly and attentive, not to mention always looking for a way to improve thier brand. I have seen nothing but improvement here. I will always stop in for as long as they are here. I recommend stopping in, no doubt you will have made a friend before you leave. I gave four out of five stars due to the fact I havent tried everything they offer yet."}
{"text":"Really stretching it giving it the two stars...the service was prompt and courteous, but that's about it.  I had the fajita salad (chicken) and the person I was with had the grilled chicken salad (buffalo style).  All in all, it was basically salad in a bag with *tiny* pieces of chicken.  The veggies weren't particularly fresh - and the lettuce even a little wilt-y.  I like the convenience of the location, but not sure I'll come here again."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Scottsdale specifically to this bar to use a Restaurant.com certificate.  Everything was great until they said we don't accept those anymore.  If an establishment signs up for a program like Restaurant.com they need to honor certificates that have already been purchased,  If they want to drop out of the program don't issue anymore but for the customer you need to honor what you committed to in  the first place.  We will never go back to this bar and shame on them for not respecting their obligations to their customers."}
{"text":"Tukees smelled like poopies! They need to do something about the smell. The beer was cold and the loaded fries were pretty good.  The service good and the waitress was pleasant. Not sure if we're going back."}
{"text":"Quick Summary: RUN! RUN FAR, FAR AWAY! Worst restaurant in Ahwatukee. This place is SO BAD that they have table talkers bribing customers with a free dessert or $1 beer in exchange for a good Yelp review!   Chef Irvine, Chef Ramsey, please salvage the good name of Ahwatukee! I haven't had a burger THIS bad since my childhood when my father would gleefully ignite the kettle grill with half a bottle of starter fluid & produce burgers that looked exactly like the charcoal briquets upon which they were cooked! I ordered a \"medium\" bleu cheese & bacon burger that was a quarter inch thick, had a sad, anemic tomato slice and cold fries. The single star is for the cheerful service. I feel sorry for the wait staff who has to serve this crap. I would not have gone to this bar, which is all it is, if not for the fact that my favorite Meetup group was gathering there for Happy Hour. Thank heavens for all the good company. We did not go unannounced, either. And we didn't all order our food at the same time. The menu touts the burger meat grind as something truly special: Special if you like preformed frozen thin patties that are cooked within an inch of their lives! To their credit, there actually was some bleu cheese, the bacon was crisp, the sautéed onions properly cooked and the bun was soft, fresh & nicely toasted. So, after removing the burger patty, the tomato & the limp, insipid pickles & lettuce I was left with bruschetta. Complained politely to the the waitress who seemed genuinely surprised stating that they are \"known\" for their burgers. But no offer of another menu item or a refund. I could have had a better burger at the nearby Carl's Jr., and I am not a fast food fan! And I'm NOT kidding when I say that they actually have cards on the tables that say if you give them a good Yelp review, you'll get a free dessert or $1 alcoholic drink! REALLY????? I was at the very least expecting basic bar food, I would have had better from the freezer & the microwave. My dinner companion tried the nachos; equally disgusting!  Vile canned nacho cheese sauce & ground beef that was so overcooked that it looked like black nuggets of grease! Thank heavens there's an Urgent Care less than a quarter of a mile away! Ironically, the BEST restaurant in Ahwatukee is directly across the street!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and have been here a couple of times now.   The nachos and wings are really good.   The waitresses are hit and miss.   The main concern is that this place is SMOKER'S HEAVEN.   Unless you love to breath in nasty second-hand smoke, skip it."}
{"text":"Thought it'd be a chill hangout with good food while we wait for tire service.  We were wrong...  I ordered Teriyaki Boneless wings, in my experience in other locations and being a culinary hobbyist, these were gonna be some awesome wings!  Heck no!  They were breaded with I don't know what, microwaved, and then someone emptied a teriyaki marinade, not glaze, frickin' salty as heck marinade!  Marinade is a marinade, you marinate in it prior to cooking, not drown the food before service.  I was served 10, ate 6, too damn nasty.  At least the carrots were fresh! My wife got chicken tenders, her choice anywhere, but left a bad impression here.  They were soaked in oil, microwaved, and didn't look at all appetizing, but we were hungry.  Fries were ok.   My impression of this place is that it must be a fun sports environment on nights and weekends and the food doesn't matter.  If you've a serious hangover or don't care as long as its food, go to Tukees!"}
{"text":"Football Sunday sat at bar that accommodates 20-25 and there was maybe 15 already there. After 8 minutes with no acknowledge from bartender and NO drink. I decided to change my 1:00 game drinking place."}
{"text":"I  can't beLieve I even have to give one star.  If you like to go  to a place that treats you the same as all the regulars your in the wrong place.  The regulars will always get prority seating and service.  The manager an or assistant manager Is a piece of ?*&^ rude and a complete and horrible person. they should fire his ass. Drink prices are outrageuos and they like to Cram you in like sardines. I recommend go somewhere but there. Their are alot more places to go in the area where you can have better drinks, prices and service."}
{"text":"Not really even worth the 1 star, 5 little dried out pcs. of shrimp, some baked bean paste, and cold mash for 11 bucks what a joke, no to mention 2 out of 3 of our plates had hair on them.Don't waste you money here"}
{"text":"The reason for the 2 extra stars is for our server Melissa.  I've gone there a few times, and she is fantastic.  She remembers your drink order and brings it right over, knows what you would like to eat and comes and actually checks on you.  If she is not our server I've experienced what the other reviews say and would have given 1 star.  We sat on the patio for 28 minutes watching servers walk past us.  My friend went up to the bar to get our drinks and the bartender said we couldn't be served because we were sitting at a table and just needed to wait.  The tequila happy hour on Tuesdays is a sweet deal, if you can get a good server then it is a great place, if not you are screwed."}
{"text":"This neighborhood bar is getting better! Great new food menu and friendly service ALWAYS. If only they played better music more consistently. :) kinda hit and miss music. Lots of good TV's for sports as well. We have made friends with lots of the regulars so it's very neighborly. Compared to the food at Zipps -- NO CONTEST! Try the bacon plate appetizer with Lagunitas Daytime beer. Mmm life is good!"}
{"text":"I only wish I had checked the reviews first. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to take our order and there were only four other tables filled.   While waiting for our food, my son spilled his drink. The waitress looked and then walked away. I cleaned it up using bar naps and they stayed on the table until we left. The food was mediocre.   Easily the worst place I've been to in a very long time!  Steer clear."}
{"text":"I did not have a good experience here. We ordered the black and bleu wings, the chicken was very dry and they when it says black & bleu you actually get wings with medium sauce mixed with bleu cheese, doesnt make sense. Also ordered a traditional French martini which wasnt made correctly and when we asked for a side of juice to add in it at the end we saw that they charged us for the extra juice to fix the drink that was made incorrectly. Our server was rude and when we voiced our concerns she rolled her eyes and made excuses. Just overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"Really nice staff.  Good food. Served in efficient amount of time. Made sure to check in if we needed anything. TV combined with radio on was loud. I asked if one or the other could be turned down some. They didn't blink an eye to that request and turned the radio down some.  Even check to see if that was a good level. I would go there again."}
{"text":"Great local bar/ restaurant. They recently expanded the menu to include craft food & beer...good food for a sports bar! Staff & owner are always really friendly & provide good service."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night for the big UFC fight.  The place was packed.  Great viewing angles all around, which is key for a sports bar.  Service was great and the staff is very easy on the eyes and friendly.  Tried the hot wings and they were crispy and spicy, just as I prefer them.  Great beer selection, with a nice balance between micro and macro beers.  Overall we had a great time and will return."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple of times.     Used to be a Hooters.  Still kinda looks like one.  Not a bad thing.   Quite a few flat screens,  some farily nice size.  First time went with my son.  He ordered the steak (medium) with some fries.  Steak came well,  very dry, and fries were out of a bag, and not very fresh.   I had the pork chop with corn and roasted fries.  Pork chop was cooked perfectly,  and my fries were better than the ones my son had.   Son was only able to eat a few bites for his meal before he gave up.  After a bit of a wait,  someone came by to ask how the food was,  and I told him that the steak was over cooked.  His response was that it tasted good though,  and walked away.    Granted for $10 that is a very good price for a steak,  and if it was cooked right,  I would give this place an extra star.  But coupled with the bad fries made me not want to ever come back to this place again.  Well last night my gf wanted to try it and watch the game.  I decided to take her to see what she thought.   Service was better this time (no long waits between check ups).  I ordered the pot roast, with garlic mashed potatoes, and baked beans.  My gf ordered the appetizer sampler platter.    My pot roast was quite tender and tasty.  It could have used some slices of onion, carrot and celery to make it a little better.  Garlic mashed potatoes were also quite good,  but my baked beans were way too sweet.    My gf's appetizer platter had fried mozzerella sticks,  wings and nachos.  Everything on it was actually pretty good a well.    So after a bad first visit, and a good 2nd,  I'm willing to give this place another chance.    Sill have a problem with the fries and the steak from the 1st vist though.  Otherwise would've been 3 stars.  But the price is quite good otherwise."}
{"text":"Ok first impressions are What??? EVERYTHING!!! That is right everything. So the night starts with this douchebag sitting in the prime patio area puffing away on a cheap Cuban imitation cigar. C'MON!!!!! Really?!?!?!? WTF fuck is wrong with management of this place???  So we move inside. 30 minutes later we flag down someone to take care of us. Then another douchebag comes in puffing on her vapor puff. WTF...AGAIN MANAGEMENT! It is one thing when it is outside. But inside where there is food and people and one douchebags kid?!?!?!?  C'mon!!!!   So like 1.5 hours later we get this junk delivered...ummm food. Apparently we should have ordered the nachos. Because that is what everyone is yelping about, right?!?!?  So here is my honest assessment. The loaded fries disgusting looking and even worse tasting. The sliders...well 70% beef and 30% grease fat and chunks of something. The Pretzel bite...something to be desired with the nasty cheese dip and the beers are appropriately dry being in the middle of the desert.   So back to the patio for another couple hours of fantastic music and lung-fulls of secondhand smoke. C'mon people, didn't smoking go out with the 80's.   My recommendation to the band....find a better venue. You are better than this place. My recommendations to civilization. Stay away! My recommendation to the patrons...change. My recommendation to management...you can do better. There is a reason most of the tables inside are empty!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Was pretty excited there was a \"new\" neiborhood bar in the area. Highly disappointed. My girlfriend and I walked in and were never greeted. Sat down and literally, not exaggerating 3 servers walked by never acknowledge us. We finally flagged down a waitress and ordered 2 beers and 2 waters. She then told us \" I'll get your server\" after sitting there for at least 15 min we decided to leave. Still never to be acknowledge by anyone! Will never be back to this place again. I'll stick with CK's or Applebee's!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere was nice. Service was average. I would go again."}
{"text":"Tukees is a great neighborhood bar and grill conveniently located right off the freeway in the heart of Ahwatukee. With a friendly wait staff and management who cares about your satisfaction I would highly recommend grabbing a nice cold beer on a hot Arizona day. Tukees has a good variety of foods to satisfy all in your party. I personally enjoyed the nachos as they are the way I would make them if I was in the kitchen. I have been a patron of Tukees since they opened and witnessed the changes first hand. They had some difficulties at first, however Steve (the owner) got is right and this is how a neighborhood bar and grill should be. This place is a good to go!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I took a ride up to the foothills to see the Christmas lights.  We were hungry, so we decided to stop in Tukees.  It was a little bit later, and there wasn't much of a crowd, so I wasn't expecting the food to be too great.  I was pleasantly surprised!!!  The wings were probably the best I have ever had, and I love me some wings.  Our server, Charles, was a doll who was very attentive.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place I've ever been.  They couldn't even put the home team game on the sound system.  The food was way over priced.  Chips and salsa is $7.  The chili sucked so bad that not even hot sauce could give it flavor.  The \"help\" were nice but horrible at their job."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday at about 5:30pm.  The place was pretty packed so we sat on the patio.  It was nice until the musician started and he was too loud.  We ordered the wings and they were pretty good.  Then we got the chicken skewers that were just OK.  We also got the caesar with salmon and it was good especially the salmon.  It was grilled and was very fresh.  They had a good variety of craft beers on tap and in bottles.  The service was pretty good too.  A good place to show off your street bike."}
{"text":"my husband and I went on a quick date night to Tukees and we were NOT great fans. the food is not that great and Ive seen better deals. You want a better sports place? Go to Native ."}
{"text":"I rarely post my feedback on Yelp but I was very disappointed in my wings.  We had a taste for some tender delicious chicken wings for lunch and decided to try a new restaurant.  We ordered 3 different types of wings and I stated I wanted wings that was wet.  Meaning not dry.  What we got with all 3 flavors was dry and overcooked wings.  I ate half of my ordered just to stop the hunger. The parmesan chicken was not seasoned when you bite into it.  It took a while for our meal to come out but I didn't want to wait for another re-order.  The waitress was nice and it was quiet for us to discuss business."}
{"text":"THE GOOD: I read all of the reviews before going to Tukee's, but we went mainly because our friend was playing there acoustically. I ordered the AZ burger and it was fantastic! Really a great gourmet burger with steak fries. My wife had the pretzels with cheese sauce and said it was ok. I was told that the place is under new management and that the food has improved greatly. I can't confirm this, and let's face it, it's hard to screw up a burger, but, it was a damn good burger. We also had the honey bar-b-q wings for an appetizer and they were delicious. I definitely recommend the wings.  THE NOT-SO-GOOD: The only thing about the reviews I can relate to was the service, which was not great. She was very friendly, but she was kind of slow. Normally, this would not be a problem, but it was a slow day and where we sat (on the patio) there was only 3 other tables that were occupied. If they can speed up the service (refills, orders, etc) they will do pretty well. I also think the prices are a bit high, but hey, it's Ahwatukee.  All in all, I'd go back. We'll see what happens next time!..."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. Food was delayed and they didn't communicate.  Then a dish never came and they were full of excuses. The owner does not get the idea of providing good service and is a hot head. We will never return."}
{"text":"Kelsey the bar tender is amazing! She had great drink recommendations and the food was tasty! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say? Friendly service, great atmosphere, relaxed and enjoyable! When you visit, ask for Steve, he will take great care of you! Great specials on happy hour, great specials on weekends, overall you must visit this place!  We ordered a burger, a turkey burger, and a couple drinks during lunch. The food was decent for a pub, the drinks phenomenal, overall I am definitely coming back here.  What really sets this place apart is the friendly service you get during your visit. We will be back, very soon! Go TUKEE!!!"}
{"text":"It looks like this place has turned over a couple chefs since my last review.  Food is OK.  The beer selection is good but I wish that the taps would rotate a bit more so that we can try new things."}
{"text":"I originally was going to give a 1 star based on service. Our waitress came quickly, however we weren't ready, she left and she never came back. We had to wave down another waitress to place our order.  After 40 minutes, we almost left, but our food arrived. I ordered tba salmon, and it was actually good. My boyfriend had the pot roast, which was al so good. The mixed vegetables and the corn on the cob tasted like it was a couple days old. Since the salmon and pot roast were good, I give it one more star."}
{"text":"Tukee's is a sports bar. Lots of televisions. Beers are plentiful and cold. Waitresses are nice and attentive. Food is okay pub grub. I think some reviewers want to just bitch. Looked clean enough for me and I did not see any roaches or rats and I doubt anyone else has either."}
{"text":"Wing seasoning and honeyhot dip was amazing!  Nachos were excellent with grilled onions.  Dead Guy Rogue Ale on tap!  Really good happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"Amazing nachos, killer grilled honey BBQ wings, live music but not too loud & very friendly staff. Awesome happy hour prices too & lots of TVs \"in all the right places\". Can you tell I've been house hunting?? ;) Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food was really good, servers were very friendly and wide selection of wines. Really enjoyed the place and will be going back soon!."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Nice neighborhood bar   Service was very quick and observant"}
{"text":"The waitress spilled a drink on me,  There was a cockroach in the dining area, and the waitress brought me a drink I did not order.  Then she charged me for it.  I seriously could not get out of there fast enough.  Thank God we did not eat there, however the thought of what was crawling in the glasses that we were drinking out of makes me want to vomit.  How is it possible that they are still in business?"}
{"text":"Funny... this is my very first Yelp review and the only reason why I thought to write is because Tukee's has a message on each table to do so. Very sad this place just can't seem to do better. The owner seems to be so nice, but totally clueless on how to run a restaurant. The girl at the front with the long blonde hair is beyond rude and NEVER has a nice look on her face EVER (yet he keeps her at the door). She should have her hair pulled back but she doesn't and that's probably just to hide the terrible looks she gives all of the PAYING customers. I was so offended by the way she treated us tonight I WILL NEVER BE BACK! She acted like she was doing us a favor by finding us a seat. The food is always good, but service is slow, the beer is warm, and it tastes like they never clean their taps. Oh and it's not really cheap either."}
{"text":"We used to love coming to this place but it has been going downhill quickly. The food used to be above average for a sports grill but now it has gotten so bad that we ate before our last visit and just went for the craft beer and live music. The service is now incredibly slow and no longer friendly. Several regulars recently said that they won't be returning anymore either. Too bad, it used to be a fun place."}
{"text":"Well I'm back at Tukee's for another night of all you can eat fish. My mouth is watering for those big chunky flakes of fryed cod. Cut as big as half dollars round and 6 inches longs.Steve the owner always meets me with my favorite cold beer because I'm usuall early to take advantage of happy our 3 -  7 pm. The cook out starts at 5:00 pm and is over at 10:pm . So get there early. Listen guys just because I was raised in the back woods in Texas and use to catching my on fish, not to mention fished commercially  for cod in the Bering sea doesn't mean you should take my word that it's the best you will get unless you catch it yourself. The other reasons are the friendly staff , Big screen TV , outside patio dining, and by far the cleanest establishment I have ever eaten at. Mel was my waitress tonight and absolutely awesome . My plate or glass never got emptied.  Her personality matches her name that she leaves on your drink napkin inside the pink heart. What a sweetie! I  I highly recommend this place anytime. Off to work back in Texas. See ya in two weeks. Thanks again Tukees!!"}
{"text":"When it opened we thought, yay a neighborhood bar to hang out. NOT. Service is horrible. Drinks are watered down and menu is sub par. Prime location, could have done a better job. Maybe train the staff a little better."}
{"text":"Bar Staff are not friendly or talkative at all.  Wait staff is fair at best, depending on who you get.  Charge different prices than advertised.  Not welcoming to new clients.  Food is about a 3 or 4 on a 10 scale."}
{"text":"Wow what a bad experience!  Waited nearly and hour for our food. When it came some of it was cold. The server apologized and said they would discount the bill. What they did is took the $7.00 bowl of chili off the $60.00 bill.  BTW, the beer they served me was expired by 3 weeks."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, i have tried to write a review before but for some reason it never showed up. Amazing happy hour prices, and the best \"bar\" food in this zip code, don't let these negative reviews steer you away, especially the one about the UFC fight, i was there, standing the whole fight, and didn't have to wait for refills all night!  Try the wings, grilled and awesome!"}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot today.  They are lucky I did not bring my phone with me to look them up.  I did however just order an app to first see if their food was edible.  It was not.  Hey if you are going to open a neighborhood place be sure not to serve frozen fried mushrooms and pass them off as fresh.  If I wanted packaged food I would go to Crapplebees.  I want fresh food from a locally owned restaurant not pre-prepared frozen food.  How sad.  I give this place another couple of months to be in business."}
{"text":"Mixed drinks/shots are ALWAYS terrible. Need better well trained bartenders. Service is usually slow. Food is mediocre. Band on Sundays is good"}
{"text":"Worst chicken tenders I've ever had, and the waitress looked at us and actually said after we paid tab with nothing being eaten...\"glad you came in and enjoyed everything.\""}
{"text":"I asked the server if I could get boneless grilled wings, and she said years so I ordered them. They came out as breaded and deep-fried balls that looked like hush puppies. So I told her I wanted grilled. She took them back to the chef, and brought them back and said \"he three them on the grill for you.\" Really?? So I sent them back and ordered a nicoise salmon salad with the salmon cooked medium. It came out and looked amazing! I started eating the salmon and it was good on the outside, but raw by the time I got three bites into it. There were a couple of bones, which happens, and I understand that. However, when I ate a bite from the other side, there was an entire row of huge bones!! I told the server and she said the cool said there would be bones. I said well if you had told me that, I wouldn't have ordered the salmon, because you remove bones from salmon filets. Sent it back and didn't pay for it. Server was clueless."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to even bother reviewing this place, but some things cannot go unspoken.  My friend heard of this place through someone he knows, so we decided to check it out. Atmosphere is standard sports bar, open space with plenty of T.V.s.  The girl that waited on us was nice and attentive at the beginning, but then things changed.  It was busy when we entered, but within 10 minutes began to clear out. The Guinness I ordered was straight poured, and I knew that would be a problem. Don't carry Guinness if you can't pour it properly. The appetizer was good, but nothing special.  Both of us ordered the fish fry (mind you, their special is All You Can Eat Friday Fish Fry) and they must have run out. It took nearly an hour to get our meal (no checking in or apologizing for the delay by the waitress or manager for something that should take 5-10 minutes). Then, when it arrives, we only receive 1 piece each! We were told the other would be right out.  Now, I'm not normally a cod fan, but I like the thick, flaky fish in a fish fry. What they served us was flat and wide (maybe tilapia?) but definitely not cod. There was virtually no batter and it wasn't hot. We both looked at each other and kind of laughed at what they served us, but we were starving so we ate it (it wasn't that bad, but not really good.)   Then, quite some time later, when we're both essentially finished, a man from the kitchen comes out (manager or owner) with the rest of our order, which we said \"no thanks, we're done\". He says, \"OK\" and walks away. Again, no apology or offer for discount - nothing. The waitress just says rhetorically \"everything good?\" and drops the check. Wow.  Overall, a really bad and expensive experience."}
{"text":"Wow, that is all I can say about this place.  I would rather eat East Indian food served in a dirty diaper than the crap that comes out of this joint.  The food here is so bad that my dog wouldn't even eat it.   Where should I start?  The wings?  Nachos?  Combo platter?  Seriously, the nachos here sucked, I mean littlerally, if there was a trailer hitch in the parking lot it would have no chrome on it that's how bad they were.   This place is not even worthy of one of my review essays but I will say this, get better help, a chef that isn't from a part of Mexico where they eat dogs and a new owner, then change the name and maybe I'll come back.  Gordon Ramsys would probly burn this sinking death ship to the ground if he had the chance just to put it out of it's misery."}
{"text":"The kitchen closes at 9. They don't have Captain Morgan, Sailor Jerry, or Kraken... and they close at 1am on Saturday :("}
{"text":"Stopped in to listen to the band. Didn't Buy any food so can't rate the quality or other aspects of that part is my visit. The drinks were strong and well made the staff was attentive WANs were always Rhee to wait on us.  Neat time in if the food is good it would be another star."}
{"text":"I go here to watch the UFC fights and Sunday Football. I like the place and really like the wings. The rest of the food is just ok bar food but they treat my Girl and I really good here."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends.  I sat down and waited 10 minutes before I waved to the hostess to get service.  The server was friendly but didn't check  back because I guess her shift was ending.  Had to wave again to refill my drink that was empty.  They didn't offer water or give plates after delivering an appetizer.  More friends came and the new server didn't know the prices of pitchers.   Will not be back."}
{"text":"Tukee's gets 5 out of 5 in my book! I don't come here often but when I do it's always amazing. Not only is the location convenient but the price is amazing. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. The helpings are great and like I said bang for your buck. Great for non sport times and even better on sporting events. They have a Alfredo as a \"House special\" I am pretty confident to say it's the best Alfredo in AZ! Today I got the Italian Beef and it blew my mind..... I am also a soda guy and their glasses are HUGE I get one refill and done! Everything I have eaten here taste great I say give it a try."}
{"text":"So... I heard there was karaoke so I came in on a Wednesday to see how good the place was! The DJ/KJ girl is awesome! Super sweet... you can sing her a line and she knows what song you mean, she is absolutely fantastic and because of her I will put up with a lot but as someone who has worked in the restaurant/bar service industry for 12 years it is mind boggling DO YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY?! I say this because I have sung three songs and have not once been asked what I would like to drink by my server or my bartender. 3 SONGS!!! That is 3 Rotations!!! I have been here for just under two hours and no service! Yes I am sitting at a table, yes I have tried to get the servers attention, the one thing I haven't done is gone up to her and done her job for her.  Awesome KJ noticed what was going on and called over the server I finally ordered and they are out of the beer I wanted. No  notice on the chalkboard that they are 86ed, nothing. Now this just adds insult to injury since I never got a menu drink or otherwise so I have to go off what is on the chalkboard. She did suggest a somewhat comparable beer, so kudos, ish. Minutes later I finally got my beer, as I am getting called for my fourth song, to say the least I am frustrated. This bar is not packed nothing should take this long in a bar where the server has time to just dance around.  I just came from one of my best dining experiences for dinner shortly before coming here so I was in a great mood and was really chill about all of this for the first hour... then I started typing. I hope the service gets better here. I just heard from someone that the KJ's friend was here last week, she gave them her drink order and asked for a food menu and the server, who is the bartender tonight, never came back to take her food order until the kitchen had closed. Really? You have a great thing going here the KJ brings in her friends and others and they try to spend money in the establishment but the staff doesn't apparently want to make money.  ::sigh::  5 stars for the KJ. 1 star for the service.  Averaged to 3... only because the KJ rocks."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight.  Although food was good when we got it, they ran out of plates and initial service was slow.  I think they need to invest in more plates and the server should immediately come to the table we contemplated walking out.  There was a fight on cable that they were sponsoring tonight and they kept saying they were busy, however it didn't look busy.    Either we hit a bad night or they just don't have their act together.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"First time here and we will definitely be back. The food was terrific, especially the wings when ordered extra crispy. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. So glad we stopped in and are going to be moving nearby very soon!"}
{"text":"I came in sober and I left drunk. Isn't that what a sports bar is all about?  Honestly I thought this was a great little neighborhood bar. Everything was clean, the service was on point and the drinks were well made. Karaoke started happening sometime during the night which is a great drunken activity. I had a lot of shots. I lot of good shots, mixed shots, yummy shots. Did I mention that I left drunk?  The only bad part of the evening was the food. Drunk me wants chocolate, and the chocolate they had was in the form of a cold and stale chocolate brownie. Sober me knows better than to order dessert from a sports bar - drunk me is not so smart.  Overall I like Tukee's! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We met up with a buddy of ours this past weekend for some wings and beer. First off, the server we started with wasn't the server we finished with, she got busy and apparently handed off some of her tables.   We started off with potato skins and a half order of nachos. The menu states it comes with your choice of meat but our server never asked us what type of meat. It all happened so fast that we didn't really get a chance to specify. Of course the nachos came out without any meat, I'm assuming when he puts the order in he's prompted to choose the meat and he decided to just put no-meat instead of coming to ask us. When the nachos came, I asked about it and he said in an accusatory tone \"you didn't specify\". I didn't like him, he had an attitude the whole time.   The music playing when we got there was great, a little old school alternative. But, in the middle of our meal they changed it to rap music, very-very loud rap music. While I do listen to that music, it has a time and a place. Mid-afternoon in a sports bar is not the place.   Between the service and the unenjoyably atmosphere, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Tukees is our corner bar & we always get the best service! If you're in ahwatukee, come on over!"}
{"text":"Just ate there tonight and it was pretty good. Husband and I both just had burgers, they were cooked how we asked. Mine had lots of bacon. Onion rings were good. Kids had hot dog and chicken tenders. Hot dog looked uh.. But he ate it. Chicken tenders were big, got 2, looked good. Were served lots of fries with their dinners. Service was good too. All in all was a good place."}
{"text":"I choose not to patronize restaurants that are not dog-friendly but do allow people to smoke anywhere, including near doors and entrances."}
{"text":"Great place for beers and friends on weekdays. Enjoy bands on the weekends. Good selection of beers."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Our server has a attitude, no patience. Food took forever to come out and a plate at a time. But I guess we don't need utensils to eat our dinner with. Got drinks and watched them at the bar. Half the employees standing around in the drink station.. This place is just horrible."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and they were decently busy. The waitress visited us twice within the first 10 minutes, then didn't come back to take our order for more than 30 minutes. Food was average. Another group walked out due to inattention while we were eating. They really need to improve the quality of service and quality of food. Atmosphere is subpar, nothing like a good sports bar and grill."}
{"text":"Easily the worst bar I have ever been to.  Tukee's, I salute you!  Out of the hundreds of bars i have been to, you have set yourself apart as the crown jewel of crappy bars in Phoenix.  Quite the impressive feat.  Anyways... here this goes...  The good:  They had the UFC fight.  Cost $5 to get in... not bad.  The bar actually appears decent and the patrons of the bar that night were pretty decent.    The bad:  So... they can afford to pay someone to charge you upon arrival but literally ZERO service afterwards.  It took my party an hour to get served drinks.  Yes.  An hour.  The waiters/waitresses actually looked like they were purposely avoiding us as we attempted to flag one down.  We were hard to miss as we were seated in the MIDDLE of the freakin bar.  The ugly:  Yes, the ugly isnt even the hour wait time to be served drinks.  Crazy.  The manager of the bar stopped by our table twice before we were greeted.  The two things out of his mouth \"Uhh... can I take the ketchup and mustard off the table?\" and \"Like, do you need this other chair?\"  Hmm.  You don't see us sitting here with no drinks and with menus we grabbed up at the bar?  Nice.  My response: \"We might use the condiments if we can place an order sometime.  Can you send us a waitstaff member or take an order from us?\"  Manager:  \"Uhh... I'm like trying to get ketchup and chairs to people but I'll get someone for ya sometime here... uhh... (walking backwards away from our table).  Great.  The waitress showed up a half hour after that point.  Sidenotes:  They had 5 beer specials for the night.  Two of us order of the special menu and my friend orders a Fat Tire which was not on the special list but on the menu.  The waitress informs us the bar doesn't carry Fat Tire and he decides to just go with a beer special.  Ok.  We receive our bill at the end of the night and we have been charged for full price Fat Tires instead of beer specials.  Ironic.  So you don't carry Fat Tire but you will be more than happy to charge me for full price beer in place of the crappy specials you have.  Thanks Tukee's.  Seriously, don't go here.  The 1 1/2 star this place has is literally 1 1/2 stars too generous.  Well, do go here... if you enjoy the world's worst service and crappy food.  Worst. Bar. Ever.  Ever.  Terrible.  Horrible."}
{"text":"The service was very bad.  They ignored us for about 15-20 minutes until the owner asked us if we had been helped. We didn't get service after that either.  I think they had been slammed previous to us getting there but they were under staffed. I'm always rooting for local businesses but they just aren't ready to be open for business.  They need a general manager and some training for their service staff. The wings and beer were pretty good but I think the wings made me sick that night. I really hope they make it."}
{"text":"I went there for team trivia. Otherwise I would not have heard of Tukees. It is a sports bar with plenty of well placed televisions. The seating, however, was very uncomfortable because the seat was hard on my rear and my back. The tables were uncomfortable because they were small and without legroom. This made sitting side by side difficult for my wife and I.  The service was ok. The hostess was very accommodating. Once we sat I waited awhile for the server to take my food order but, otherwise, she was ok.  The food was horrible. My wife and I ordered spinach dip and nachos to share.  The chips were too thin, even for their spinach dip, so they constantly broke. The nachos were very bland and all the ingredients came from a can. It came with mild salsa but I wanted more spice. The only hot sauce available was Tabasco. I don't drink so I cannot rate their drinks. I would go back if the tables were more spacious but I would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Not a bad watering hole! Bartender was super friendly. The artichoke dip was fantastic and the beer was decent!! Definitely will be returning on my next trip to PHX."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food never comes out as ordered, you're lucky if you even get your food within 25 mins. Idk why I keep thinking things will get better. They won't!"}
{"text":"Ok food, generally inattentive service over multiple visits. If convenient ok, not worthy of a trip."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try considering I live so close. I walked in and the employees were talking to one another and some on their phones. I was never greeted and sat myself down. After 15 minutes I finally got greeted and asked what I wanted to drink. I left in anger and I will NOT be coming back ever again."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for happy hour and I was NOT impressed.   We literally saw a cockroach crawling through the dining area!   Tukee's is just a dirty sports bar with poor service."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't give 0 stars. The service is horrendous. This is the 2nd time we came and only bc we had bought a gift certificate from restaraunt.com. There were girls running all over the place that worked there, but apparently were not servers. Our server had the most annoying voice I've ever heard... But honestly, not sure how I even remembered what it sounded like because she took sooooo long to bring is drinks and our food. The food was ok, but not enough to ever go back. Had the HOT MESS burger, which was ok... But not amazing. Ordered a prankster at first, which was good... Then ordered a 2nd which was NOT PRANKSTER. pretty sure it was green flash, which was enough for us to be done and get the check. If you can't get a simple beer order right, you can't get anything right. Never will be back."}
{"text":"The food was not great at all. Yes I know it is bar food but it tasted like canned food. Husband ordered the chili and sad to even admit but he said Wendy's is better! I ordered a mix drink and it was not even close to what it should have been. Overall service was fine."}
{"text":"I wanted to see how the local beers are in Phoenix and enjoyed Tilted Kilt Red Ale and Big Blue Van beer. Both were great and decently priced. Bartender was polite but took awhile to get to me as it was Friday night I guess. I didn't try the food only the beer. I recommend this place as they have a nice variety of beer."}
{"text":"We were in town for the NHRA event in Feb2014 and went to Tukee's twice.  Each visit will be covered separately.  Read on...  This establishment was originally a Hooter's and the decor is a carry-over from that period.  A variety of  \"regular\" and  \"high-top\"  tables dot the dining room, and there's an outside dining area with ample seating.  The bar seats perhaps 15-20.  There are a LOT of TVs tuned to a variety of channels, and all are muted.  Music plays over the house system.  Overall, it is quite inviting.  The location is convenient, at the corner of 48th Street and Chandler, just east of I-10.  Thursday Feb19 four of us went to Tukee's for beer and food around 7pm that evening.  The place was busy but not full.  There were tables open.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  The music was \"country\" at a comfortable level, allowing the four of us to talk readily.  All four of us thought our food was very good. - Three had burgers, which were larger patties on toasted buns - Two had onion rings with the burgers - One had home-made potato chips with the burger - One had a avocado chicken wrap \"sandwich\"  The domestic beer draughts were reasonably priced.   Sunday Feb22 we returned to Tukee's, arriving at about 6:30pm.  The place was not very busy, with only a few patrons (which is what we expected for a Sunday evening) in the dining room and at the bar. We were greeted and seated promptly.  The music was some sort of \"hip-hop\", but it was at a comfortable level, allowing the four of us to talk readily.   The music selection didn't really match the clientele, most of which were 30+ (with the exception of a family with a couple of kids around 12-14, and a few patrons at the bar perhaps in their later 20s).    The waitress obliged when we asked her to change one of the TVs to ESPN2.  We all had the same food as before (see above) and but the quality was not as good ; that was OK though, I  \"chalked it up\"  to the fact the kitchen wasn't as busy and probably wasn't well staffed (this being a Sunday).  At some point in the evening, the hip-hop music got quite a bit louder and conversation became difficult, but manageable.  But, at one point some hip-hop tune came on with lyrics of  \"f___\"  and   \"bit__\"   used repeatedly, and we got fed up.   We called the waitress; she obliged and promptly changed the \"channel\" (satellite radio, perhaps?  It wasn't a juke box.) and turned-down the volume.   Oddly, it seemed to us that the only people in the place that might have enjoyed the music was the staff  itself; as we looked around the room, almost everyone was 30+ (see my notes above).   So, I rate the place as hit-or-miss.  I would go back and take the risk; the food was good and the drink prices reasonable.  If the music gets obnoxious again, we'll probably leave and take our business elsewhere.  Oh, one final remark.  Some other reviews (around Feb 2015) make note of \"the smell\".  This place has some sort of problem (with the sewer or a vent?) and, occasionally, it smelled like sh__  at our table in the dining room (and we were seated far away from the bathrooms).   Honestly, the smell wasn't persistent; it only occurred a couple of times and we only noticed it on our second visit (Sunday Feb22).  I might assume they'll have the problem addressed before long."}
{"text":"A watering hole convenient to the workplace great staff easygoing and great beer. Another one to add to the list. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Not sure when this place took a turn for the worse but the service, food quality and beer selection is sub-par now. The servers have no beer knowledge to help recommend any kind of beer. They also are more concerned with socializing amongst themselves or smoking cigs on the patio. Beer rotation is severely lacking. I've been 2-3 times in the last 2 months and it's been the same beer on tap. Also, there were mice scampering across the patio during my last visit."}
{"text":"Best wings I have had in a very, very long time! The burgers are huge and so tasty. Bartender was attentive and did a great job, even while busy during Sunday football."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit and the wings are the best we have ever had. This service was amazing and the music on the patio rocks. Totally kid friendly!!! One of the best lunches we have had in a very long time :)"}
{"text":"I was supposed to go to a different sports bar, but ended up here instead after some communication mishaps. I wasn't looking for anything too special, but this place was definitely lower than my expectations.   Upon entering, I was immediately turned-off by our waitress who was overly friendly, invasive, and needed her fingers to count if I was 21 or not. However, she was attentive, and came by several times to see how we were doing, which I appreciated. Sounds like some other Yelpers didn't get the same treatment!  The food was mediocre at best, but the prices are relatively low and they bring a ton of food so it's easy to split and save a little. The menu is long, but there's absolutely nothing interesting on it. No interesting twist on American favorites, no chef creations, nothing. Just the same standard food you can get at any American restaurant.   For an appetizer we split the supreme nachos with pulled pork and they were decent. Definitely better than I thought it would be, with a small kick. For my meal, I ordered the fish and chips, which was okay. The fish was a little too greasy, and it was wide, flat pieces, instead of the traditional thicker long slices. The crust was also strangely spicy, which I did not appreciate. The fries were mediocre--definitely had better.  The atmosphere was really nice, however. Large tables, lots of television sets, and they usually do raffles to win a sports jersey, which is cool if you're into that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Okay food - the Arizona burger was nothing to write home about.  Horrid service.  When there are more children than adults at a sports bar, it's a sign to move on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The Italian Beef was great. Service was quick and friendly. Full bar and good selection of beer."}
{"text":"I have to say I was skeptical based on the poor reviews here, but we tried this place and felt it deserved better reviews.  The key thing is, set your expectations.  It's a bar first and foremost.    We stayed with the Nachos, Salad, Burger and Club Sandwich.  All were average.  The fries were actually pretty good.  I know others around us had the entrees on the menu and they all seemed to be OK with the food.  One said the veggies were soggy.    Personally, I would have a hard time ordering a steak or pork chop at a place like this.  We ate on the patio and enjoy the \"live\" music and great weather.  The waitress was incredibly helpful and responsive given the number of people that were there.  I'd put this place on par with Teakwoods for decent bar food, but I haven't ventured into the more complex entrees - nor do I think I will."}
{"text":"This  place is great! Friendly  staff , love Melissa and Terra. Delicious  food . Nice cozy home town pub. Always feel welcomed  when i come hrre."}
{"text":"The service was good, we enjoyed the bottomless chips and salsa. The staff was friendly and they turned on the football we requested. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"After spending a hot morning & early afternoon at NHRA, we wandered in here for a huge beer at a decent price. The place was welcoming, very relaxing & our waitress was very helpful & friendly! She said the burgers were great & the AZ burger did not disappoint, highly recommend & will return next year when we're back at the track"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to come and have a burger n beer. The boneless chicken wings were overcooked. They do have ample outdoor seating and plenty of Tv's so I'd definitely come back to watch a game and drink a couple of beers"}
{"text":"The newest place in Tukee where they'll cut you off because they THINK you're drunk. Ask you to leave and then get you license plate and call the cops on you.   AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Great place beer cheep wings are great karaoke on weds great karaoke host! Good singers not a big line you'll sing all night"}
{"text":"We arrived and asked to sit outside because inside it was loud as people were singing karaoke. As we walked outside to our table it smelt like rotten egg. After we sat down our waiter was very quick, great service. We look around and realize there are a group of girls with the restaurants name on their tank top and they are all sitting together at a table drinking and smoking cigarettes. They're sitting with two men that look like they could possibly own the bar. Why would you let your staff sit outside and do this?! Really?! Doesn't look good when it's right outside the front door."}
{"text":"Not the best. Not the worst, but not the best. Service was pretty lax, food was nothing to write home about, not a huge selection either. Wouldn't go back if given the chance, I'd try something new"}
{"text":"Good food and good place to come for live music. Get the Tukee dry rub on the wings they are fantastic. They have UFC too!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried this place out on Saturday night. Based on the reviews and ratings it was not my first choice, but, because it was the only sports bar in Ahwatukee showing a particular sporting event that we wanted to watch, Tukee's is where we ended up. We called ahead to ask how far in advance we needed to arrive in order to get a table and the employee informed us that 20 minutes before the 7:00PM start time was suggested.  We arrived at 6:30PM and we were immediately directed outside for seating, no indoor dining was available.  We took our seats outside, however, I did feel a little mislead. When we called to ask about the seating situation earlier in the day, the woman indicated a 6:40 arrival would ensure a table, however, she failed to mention that the only seating for the event would be outdoors.  The conditions on the patio were less than optimal with only one gas heater for the entire patio.  We started with 2 Stellas (not on their drink menu, makes me wonder what else they have that is not listed) and an order of chicken nachos. The nachos were excellent! I was pleasantly surprised. Generous portion, the grilled chicken had a great flavor, and there was plenty of cheese and toppings. For entrees my fiance ordered the AZ Burger and I got the boneless honey hot wings. The AZ Burger, was good, not great, but not horrible. Was nothing to write home about, but still good in terms of bar food.  Then there were the boneless wings.... now those were just downright terrible. I can honestly say that I have never been letdown by a boneless wing, chicken strip, or chicken nugget before until those BAD boys. The breading was interesting to say the least. Maybe a cornmeal breading? However, it was the meat that was the real disappointment. I have never tasted a piece of chicken that was so dry, and tough ! Maybe the meat was old when they breaded it, or the wings were stale from sitting out to long? Whatever the case, they were awful! They definitely gave my jaw a workout wile trying to chew them! I was not able to finish my meal and had to leave a good portion of my dinner behind. The sauce was pleasant, not what I would describe as \"honey hot\", but still good. Maybe their grilled bone-in wings are better? Fresher? Service was far from stellar. Extremely slow, waitress would disappear for absurd amounts of time, was not given any silverware, did not come back to check on us once the food was delivered. She was remarkably fast and came back twice when it came to taking our credit card for the check though (funny how that works).  Overall, I would go back and give Tukee's another chance before making my final decision. Hoping that the service failures were simply due to how busy they were. Will not be getting the wings again though! I'm going to play it safe next time and stick with the nachos!"}
{"text":"Awful! Sat outside for 20 min and got no service just servers walking by us. For our first time there definitely not a great experience"}
{"text":"I've been to this bar about 3 times and I've never, ever had a bad experience! When I first went I had the Honey Hot wings and they were super yummy. The next time went we got Chicken Nachos and Calamari, both were good, not like over the top tasty but  still good. The last time I went I got some sort of hamburger with avocado on it and it was good..but I did ask for it medium rare and it came out well done..that was the only time something wasn't exactly how I wanted it. Overall I do like coming here to just hang out, I'll defiantly be going back!"}
{"text":"Went to Tukee's  for the first time tonight and the food and beers were so good!! Loved the Spinach Dip, the pretzel bites and the Pinot Grigio as well! Great Happy Hour and our server Brianne was AWESOME!! She was very efficient, friendly and polite! We loved her!!"}
{"text":"Tukee's is a pretty good place.  Fries could be cooked more, burger could be cooked closer to requested temp.    But overall a solid place to go.  Great beer selection. Live band when we were there at 7.   Definitely 3+ star, with potential."}
{"text":"Went here after a soccer game, worst service, and the food was terrible! There was the big UFC fight that night and we were made to feel like we weren't welcomed even if it was hours before. The food was subpar.   I wouldn't recommend going here at all!"}
{"text":"reading some of the bad reviews of this place and I'm scratching my head to why...  My wife and I came here this afternoon and found the waiter to be FANTASTIC to start off  We started out with a appetizer (Pretzel Bites with Queso) DELICIOUS!  Sitting on the nice clean patio outside with the water misters feels great! patio is huge... I had the Build your own burger and holy crap it was great! Our experience was awesome! Didn't have any issues...Will come again!"}
{"text":"For a neighborhood bar getting the local feel, a happy hour until 7pm with great live music. Yes, solid 4 stars. The Tukee wings are THE best I have ever tasted. The rub is great but also the wings are good sized. Many places start with good quality chicken then switch to lower smaller. Really enjoyed the outdoor patio. It was packed and I felt the service was good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite neighborhood sports bar. They have great food, especially their tukee rub wings, which you can also get the rub on your fries, which is delicious! They have plenty of tvs to watch sports and it's awesome that they always offer the UFC fights, which is hard to find in this area! The owner and the wait staff are always friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice recently.  They higher good bands so I initially went to see a band I like.  Desert Dixie.  While there I had some incredible chicken.  So good I asked about the seasoning because I want to take some home.  They said the chef makes his own seasoning but he wasn't there.   The next time I asked for him to buy the seasoning.  During this conversation I learned that they make almost everything \"in house\".  Salad dressings, seasonings,  red sauce, white sauce, etc.    He said they even make their own mozzarella sticks.  The cut them from a large block of cheese.  In a town full of chain restaurants, it is nice to have an alternative.  A locally owned restaurant that prepares their own food in house so it is unique and very good.    I also support live music and appreciate that they do as well."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time because we had a couple gift certificates.   Average atmosphere.  The food was below average bar food.  Had a problem using the gift certificates.  Overall a bad experience and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give no stars?  One time when I was about ten years old my family and relatives got up and left a restaurant because it took so long to get our food. Paid for our drinks and boo-ya see ya.   Nice part about our visit to Tukee's was it was so affordable. It cost us nothing to get up and walk out. This little sports bar is maybe half a block from where I live and I've passed it numerous times. Jen and I decided to give it a god today since we had never been. Walked in and one I waitresses said, \"Just sit wherever you like.\"  There were about six staff working including the bartender.  The waitress handling our section stopped by the table right next to is and then apparently was kidnapped by space aliens and taken away to their planet for experimentation because we never saw her again. There were maybe so tables with people eating and two guys at the bar. I've heard of overworked but I don't think this was the case.   We waited about ten minutes which doesn't seem like a long time but it only takes five seconds to greet a table a take a drink order. We left and won't be back. We headed to Naber's which has never disappointed."}
{"text":"The only reason this place get's two stars is because our server was fun and attentive and got our stuff out to us in good time even though it was really busy with a Super Bowl crowd.  The food, however, pretty much sucked. I got the chicken sliders - the chicken was bone-dry, out-of-the-freezer crap, and the bun tasted stale. The sweet potato fries were okay. The appetizer plate was pretty much out-of-the-freezer taste as well. We ended the night with a brownie that tasted like stale cake. Seriously, I could've made a better brownie out of a Betty Crocker box. Never again!"}
{"text":"I am confused why all the bad reviews, I have been coming here ever since they opened. The bars before, Hooters and Dugout didn't last at this location so this was a challenge for Steve. This sports bar has gone through its struggles as any beginning business does. Steve has worked hard to find ways to improve and it shows. The staff is friendly, food is great. There are enough TVs to show all the games and they make sure you see your favorite team. Don't believe all the bad reviews, come and see for yourself you won't be disappointed. The new happy hour from 11-7  M-F is 1/2 off any alcohol plus food specials.  I don't work there or part of the family, I'm just a guy that knows what kind of bar I like and this one I like.  Stop by, ask for Steve or Mark and see for yourself how they go the extra effort to make your stay enjoyable."}
{"text":"My quick summary: Not even up to par for bar food.  My fiance and I visited this location one Sat night because we didn't want to cook & it was close by.  We're on the hunt for a nice bar to go & enjoy football games at once the season starts.  The first that struck us was the decor.  You can easily identify this location used to be a Hooters.  It just looks like they took the decorations out.  They've added nothing to it.  There was hardly anyone in the bar, maybe 5-6 other tables.  The waitress took an extremely long time to come and take our orders.  We ordered the red pepper poppers as an appetizer, my fiancé ordered hot wings for his entrée, and I ordered the BBQ pork sliders with wasabi slaw.    The food took way too long (at least 25 mins to arrive).  I don't know how it took so long, considering the quality of the food.  We noticed a couple of things immediately.  The poppers did not come as an appetizer as requested, they brought them with the rest of the meal.  The BBQ pork sliders looked dry & old.    I can easily say, the poppers were the best part of the meal.  They were creamy with just enough heat.  I'd eat them any day of the week.    The wings were nothing to write home about. They were fine, but not great.    The BBQ sauce on the pork wasn't that flavorful, and it was quite obvious they scooped the BBQ pork out of a pan that had cooked quite some time ago.  The buns were stale and kinds of hard.  It was truly disappointing.  The biggest insult, though, was the wasabi slaw.  How can you claim to have a wasabi slaw when it has no wasabi whatsoever?  It was just plain coleslaw that was something you can buy at any grocery store & slap on a plate.  There was no spice, nothing exciting about it.  It was even a little watery.  We will not be dining there again."}
{"text":"If you like Green Bay this is the place to watch football good food great beer on tap lots of TVs"}
{"text":"I am really surprised that Tukees has such awful reviews.  I live nearby and come here often.  I have always had a great experience.  The food is amazing and the staff is very attentive.   The live music is great too."}
{"text":"Ate here on Friday and it was ok. The waitress was pretty good but the food was not all that.  I ordered the Southwest Burger but unfortunately, the burger and fries were salty as hell! I'm willing to give this place one more chance though."}
{"text":"If I didn't live right across the street from this place and walk there I probably wouldn't go there at all to be honest. Not that it's bad but it's just not overwhelming enough to keep me going back. It's a good place for happy hour and to watch the game but the food isn't very good at all and compared to ck's down the road the options are limited and the prices are high food wise. Service is hit or miss the main bartender is very good and friendly I don't know her name and the server Danica is very good but we've also had some subpar service from others. It's an alright place for happy hour and to grab some drinks but nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"This place is terrible...the atmosphere sucks and so does everyone's attitude. The food is OK, but not worth the money. I would rather go to Buffalo Wild Wings or a Hooters over this place any day. Oddly enough this place used to be a Hooters..."}
{"text":"I have been here about 15 times and it is one of my favorite sports bars in the Tukee. Most of their food is very good. Spinach Queso dip, wings, burgers and Sunday Mimosa specials are all outstanding. Casual atmosphere with a bright local sports bar ambiance. Plenty of TVs to watch games."}
{"text":"Hours are not as reported! Doors do unlock the reported time but they look at you like idiots when you walk in expecting to get served. Better check there even in business before going here, probably won't last long."}
{"text":"The food was alright but I ordered breakfast so I ordered my hash-browns with cheese the cheese was unmelted and cold my OJ was warm had to ask for ice I understand when you get a big group thrown at you but it's your job and since I use to be a waiter and bartender I get it but this place is subpar and will not return Waffle House has a better rating then this place they didn't even have coffee   Also let me add that we had another parent with children order French toast which came out raw they took it back and put the food that was outside on the table and cut into back on there stove the father sent it back again and refused to eat it. It's unsanitary to do this as well. He ended up talking with the manager she apologized but still the kitchen has some things to work on"}
{"text":"We were visiting family in the Pheonix area and went to dinner at this restaurant.  What a great place!  The ribs are amazing, we had friendly service, and there were a ton of TV's around to watch sports on.  Great prices on drinks and food.  DEFINITELY MY FAVE SPORTS BAR/RESTAURANT IN THE PHOENIX AREA!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is eh. The service is decent. The bartenders are young and fun. The music I love. Good ol' classic rock.  Went in for Happy hour. I ordered the chicken skewers and a beer. Nothing special about it. Could use a little dressing up, but hey it's a healthy dish and I appreciate that at a bar. They weren't fried or coated with anything crazy just grilled chicken with a side of buffalo sauce. Maybe just add some carrots and celery sticks for color. Son got a jalapeno burger (not on HH) and he seemed to enjoy it, he's not very picky tho.   The HH menu could use a little help. Not a lot of options."}
{"text":"This place advertises weekly drink specials that appear very clear to the customer,  but apparently they don't stand behind those prices when you receive your tab. The bartender even admitted the signage is misleading, but said there was nothing she could do. Would have been nice of her to bring that to our attention when we continued to order the drink special. Service was less than great the whole night anyway."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty good. The bar is clean and the TV's are quality to watch a game. I have been here three times and the service is horrible. Not sure if the staff has to many tables or what their issue is but I am always waiting to long for each stage of the evening. The last time she took about 10 min to take my drink order, the a while to ask for food. After we ate I had to go find her for the check. Second time it was this bad! My wife and I agreed we would never go back. Food is average so not worth the horrible service."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, this used to be our weekend joint when we lived nearby. Drinks are good and prices well, I will absolutely swear by the time dry rub wings. Best I have ever had, they so quite different but amazingly delicious! Crave those wings every now and then."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years. But I drove by and thought to myself: \"I can't believe this place is still open. Their food is bad and their service is worse.\"  I just felt like sharing that. That is all. Good day, sir!   Updated 08/15/17 This review remains at 1 star. If I could make it zero, I would. I coordinated a trivia night with friends here tonight and boy do I regret it. I hadn't been here since 2012. Check the very first tip on this place. Yeah, that was me. Stupid of me to come back 5 years later thinking they would have improved. The ONLY reason we came here was because we rotate to different trivia locations every month. I chose to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I should've checked their reviews beforehand. I would've never come here. I can't stress that enough.   My 6 year old nephew ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. They cheese wasn't even melted. We returned it and asked for a second sandwich. The cheese STILL WASN'T MELTED. I spoke with the manager. She apologized, of course, and didn't charge me for the meal. But I left. Immediately. I should have made my group leave with me. But they stayed for trivia. The group consensus was \"food was mediocre, service was slow, and no one got happy hour pricing because she entered the order at 7:01.\"   Apparently their AC was also broken. My friend asked them 'what time did it break' thinking it broke today and the hostess said 'oh a few days ago' smh seriously??   my group ended up winning third place in trivia and a $10 voucher. NO ONE wants to come back here. And none of us will ever come back.  All I have to say to management is \"get your shit together. Or just shut down. You guys suck. Period.\""}
{"text":"I almost always get one thing on the menu - turkey burger with cheddar and jalapenos.  Super good!  And the side salad is not only really good, but huge.  I have been here many times and service has always been great."}
{"text":"Great place.  Food selection is broad and the nachos and skewers are great.  Love the spicy honey BBQ sauce.   Excellent selection of craft beers too including some great local offerings.  Place was busy on a Wednesday night, ramping up for Karaoke while the Western conference  NBA Finals and Stanley Cup playoffs were on.  NOTE: WIFI password was TheBears so you can draw your own conclusions about the sports fans that might be here.  Ari was a great server, and even after she cut me off from 9 sample glasses of tap beers, she still made sure my glass was never empty.  Give her a raise.  LOVE this place. Except until I'm the only Cavs fan here watching them humiliate the Bulls."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not what I expected... Not sure what I expected.  They are sort of a country bar with loud music playing.  It looks like they have live entertainment sometimes but that wasn't going on when I was there.  I tried the boneless wings and had a beer on tap.  The wings were pretty good (really crispy) and the beer was interesting (tried a new local beer I had never heard of before).  It's a pretty good place but I can't imagine frequenting."}
{"text":"Amazing time a must visit during happy hour and when Honey Brown playing a gem amazing ..Chuck the server ensures alllll your needs are met!!!"}
{"text":"You know what sucks? This place. There used to be a Hooters at this spot, and I wish they'd bring it back. The food here is atrocious. Sometimes you will see a bunch of people on the patio, but they might just be setting up a triage for everyone who ordered the Tukee Dry Rub wings. The wings were dry, and there was a pile of rub sitting on the plate. The server was nice and gave us 1/2 off our meal. Good service/bad food. It you want to go to a good sports bar, hit up Bleachers on Chandler Blvd."}
{"text":"PLECK! I'm sure this place has its appeal being an old hooters but i feel its lost its luster. The food is truly my only commentary being poor at best. The new local frozen food distributors must have some new cheese sticks up for oa deal that are HORRIBLE if i must say, I've even seen them a couple other places (blue cheese buffalo something or other?, YUCK).  We ordered the sampler platter, i was totally disappointed, all in all i feel like deep fried and frozen was all their menu had to offer. I wont be back, there are too many other places with good atsomphere and MUCH better food to waste my time.."}
{"text":"I eat at Tukee's weekly & have left happy every time. The food is pretty darn good--and reasonably priced.  The happy-hour drinks are cheap & the service is good...what's not to like? I have brought both friends & clients here, and I know that many of each have returned to Tukee's on their own. Thank you!"}
