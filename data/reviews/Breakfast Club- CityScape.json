{"text":"Look, this place rocks...but isn't coffee a first and a must? I didn't get it before or with my meal, but maybe 5 min after I got my French toast. The waitress said it was because they were brewing a fresh pot. Eh-I suppose 11:45am is a little late to expect coffee to be ready to go. (She offered me a cup to go as we were paying the bill which made up for it anyway) Food here= perfectly prepared, well thought flavor combinations, and unique ingredients. The french toast made with challah bread is probably the best French toast I've ever had-AND they offer 100% pure maple syrup. I've also had The Bird omelet-and all I can say is WOW. Only complaint is that it was huge and I felt the need to finish every last delicious bite. That being said-you could definitely split any of their omelets or French toast with a willing friend or spouse. My husband got the Benedict with portabella mushrooms and it was equally as delicious. The mushrooms tasted marinated and roasted at the same time and had a slightly sweet/sour taste to pair w the saltiness of the egg and the creaminess of the hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"Front of the house servers were the worst. Looks like they are all on zero hours of sleep and are not very nice at all.  Food was great until I noticed the chef was gone and now the food looks like it comes out and has no flavor.  I've peakedinthe kitchen because I was having relations with multiple servers which was not hard to do they are easily ready to leave with you and drink.  Most importantly the kitchen and its staff is the dirtiest I've ever seen in my life.  Never wash there hands and rub then on aprons. I know this because I see them do it and then they have landing strips of grease and blood and eggs etc all up and down aprons. Never going back. Disgusted and let down on this place. Good luck."}
{"text":"Based on some reviews we were preparing ourselves for good food but not so great service. We had absolutely great food and fast, attentive service. I had the Border Bowl and my wife had the Huevos Rancheros.  Both came with delicious pork green chili. The coffee was fresh and hot and we got many refills on water. If we were staying more than two nights we would have gone back to try the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Terrible food snd snarky service.  My green chilli omelet arived stuffed with luke warm Salted shredded pork. No sauce. Sent back as it was like a dear lick.  Disgusting. Snarky waitresss slamed th ed/ plate in to.garbage. broght me overcooked eggs with old grout. SKIP THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food!! Latte was perfect. Got the BC signature French toast which was delicious!"}
{"text":"Whoever wrote about the warm coffee, not hot- dead on! Portions good size but it was loud and menu limited.  My pancake tasted like a vanilla cupcake.  Beaus breakfast burrito with green pork chilli was good.  Service was good even at 1230 on a Monday.  He says its excellent, I can take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Went today on recommendation by a staffer at our hotel and we were not disappointed. Service was great and food delicious. I had the huevos con masa which was incredible. Hubs had the green chicken chili omelette and he loved. Great Southwest flavors. Kids had waffles and pancakes. Both were very tasty. The fruit  was very fresh and the bacon. Oh my word the crispy bacon!"}
{"text":"Glorified diner. *rolls eyes* The omlets leave a lot to be desired and majority of the servers are fairly transparent in theory attempts to win you over for an extra buck. Plus, the manager of this place has that ever-so-welcoming ex-con look about him. Great French toast though."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I have gone almost every Sunday for the past year with my family and I have tried almost everything on the breakfast menu- there is not one thing I have disliked. Service is amazing, food is phenomenal, it's an overall wonderful experience for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Does anybody even work at their \"to-go\" kiosk outside the restaurant? This is the fourth time in two weeks I've arrived at work early, wanted to buy a quick snack (muffin or salad) and stood at the register for several minutes without seeing anyone at  all. If the doors are wide open and music is blaring one would assume the place to be open. It just happened to me again today and at this point I'm done trying. Don't keep the kiosk open if you're not even going to have anyone working it."}
{"text":"Depends on what you order but most of the food is very oily/fattening. I got the biscuits and gravy, the taste was okay, I've had way better though.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite movies and I'm always on the look out for the cast in here. So far, no luck. However, I've never been here on a Saturday so that may be the problem.  I work nearby and occasionally the only convenient time to meet with someone is first thing in the morning. This is my go-to meet for breakfast spot.  The food is very good, the service is fine and I've never had much trouble finding a table.  They offer a range of items on their menu - from something light to go for it big boy!  I usually get an omelette - light and fluffy and I've tried the Huevos Rancheros (so-so but OK).  I've dropped in here a few times for lunch as well. The wraps are pretty good.  Bottom line - nice place to grab breakfast if you're at or near CityScape.  Don't expect \"WOW, OMG, Best. Breakfast. Ever!\" but you'll walk away happy.  You should also not expect to see the cast of the movie."}
{"text":"The food? Great. A good variety and haven't had anything that I didn't like (although, the portabella wrap has gone a bit downhill recently..)  The service? Needs improvement. For example, I ordered something off the menu and the girl working the kiosk during lunch today told me they didn't have that or most of the things listed on the menu. When I found something on the menu that they did actually have, she told me it was double the price..(sorry, what?!) I finally found a salad on the menu that was the price listed on the menu (revolutionary) bought it and left. Back at my office I realize she didn't give me utensils or salad dressing...yum."}
{"text":"This place is very cute; I've been here a few times.   It's  a good location if you want to get a late breakfast, or lunch in downtown Phoenix.  I got the breakfast burrito with queso, which was really good. It was just a tad bit overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"The breakfast club is a great place for breakfast/brunch. My mother and I love the Scottsdale location. We eat there often so I was excited to hear about the downtown opening, especially because her and I are both to to school downtown. My husband and I eat here frequently as well. The website indicates they are open until 3pm, but my husband called last week at 2:15 to confirm they were open until 3 and the girl who answered the phone said they were already closed. He informed her what the website said to which she quickly responded \"they close whenever they feel like it.\" We eat there often (4-5 times a month) and the staff are extremely wonderful so maybe the girl was new??? One of the servers even remembered our order from the week prior which I always think is nice when a server takes note of the regulars! Hopefully the rude girl was a fluke because it seemed so out of character!! Great food, great vibe!!! Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Way too much food for $8.75!!! Delicious! Pork sausage was scrumptious, eggs scrambled perfectly, potatoes fairly undercooked but I didn't mind. Our waitress was awesome. I'd definitely join the club again. She even offered me a coffee to go. Killer"}
{"text":"We come here often because we live downtown. When this place opened it was great, good food and decent service. This morning it was packed and they could not handle it...there must not have been a manager because everyone was running around and the place was a mess. When we were finally seated I ordered my usual iced mocha. After 10 minutes our sever apologized for the coffe not being ready, as it was being made by Mark the barista. When I did get my coffee, thank god I stirred it up because there was a balled up napkin in it! I gave it back and Mark replied that he had just made it and it wasn't like that (like I had done it to my own coffee). He made a new one and rudely brought it to our table without even looking at me. To top it off he made the WRONG kind. I get it, they were busy and people make mistakes. A simple sorry or pretending like he cared would have made the situation better.  The food is good but we've had too many experiences with mark and a few others there that we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The best French toast and biscuits n gravy around, but the coffee is bad. Since breakfast, at least for me, is all about good food and coffee, I have to dock a star for the coffee.   -Great service -Great location -Great food -Bad coffee"}
{"text":"It's a great place to walk to and just have good meal. I would say sit outside if you can. Inside can some times get a little loud."}
{"text":"The signature French toast is one of the best I've had! The jalape√±o cheddar biscuits smothered with country sausage gravy is unique and delicious, too! I will be back here next time I'm visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"The service is great, food is good, the only problem is it's almost iimpossible to get hot coffee. If u are lucky enough to get hot coffee they will surley give you a refill with Luke warm coffee. I've complained and have heard others complain but nothing ever gets done about it. I think we will go elsewhere for breakfast."}
{"text":"A big THANK YOU to the Breakfast Club - City Scape. My husband and I got married on a Friday evening next door at Hotel Palomar and wanted to find a place for family and friends to have breakfast together the next morning. While the Breakfast Club doesn't typically take reservations, they did promise to accommodate our large group to the best of their ability. That Saturday, our 'large group' increased by at least 10 and the staff didn't skip a beat, finding a way for all of us to at least be in proximity to each other. It worked out so well, the food and service were amazing, and we wanted to thank you for making our wedding breakfast a wonderful part of weekend!!!"}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club is located in my office building and I have both Breakfast and Lunch there on a regular basis. The food is terrific, the prices are low, and the service is excellent. On top of that they also cater lunch to my offices on a regular basis. They are always on time and are very discrete. My staff love their food and its usually quite a fenzy when the buffet gets setup. I highly recommend both eating at their restaurant and using their catering services."}
{"text":"It's a little hard to find if you haven't been there before.  Walk around the corner and up the stairs from the street address.  Stopped for breakfast and really enjoyed the pleasant morning.  Ordered a Border Bowl that was tasty, but didn't blow my mind.  Good mix of flavors, but the presentation isn't necessarily appealing.  Then again, who cares, it was tasty.....  Good amount of heat in the chorizo.    Our server Whitney was top notch, very friendly, and made for a great meal.  Will definitely go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Once you find the place, expect to be treated rudely. Normally I wouldn't have waited 30 minutes after the snooty hostess gave me the honor of placing my name on the waiting list but I was hungry and didn't feel like looking for another restaurant. I downloaded the app they suggested to monitor my place in line only to find out 15 minutes later that it took me off the list.  From the time we were seated till the meal was over everything was fine, the food was plentiful, delicious and hot. If this place could fix their terrible first impression they would have it all."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but our morning was ruined by the waitress.. so rude. Aren't you supposed to be working your tip? Wish she was wearing a name tag or we got her name so we could talk to the manager. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Insanely good breakfast spot. The wait staff is great and the food is on point. Tried a few different plates over a seven day stay. The huevos con masa and the quick start loaded were my two favorites."}
{"text":"BC Sandwich: Substitute Sourdough for English Muffin add Ham! Lean and Green Omelette may very well be the best egg white omelette I've ever had - of course, add ham."}
{"text":"Be prepared for flies inside, hair in your food, and unsatisfactory cold food.  One dish had the hair and another was not cooked properly.  Four out of five dishes were cold."}
{"text":"MERCEDES (hostess) will be the reason we never come back to Breakfast Club again.  You just can't have someone that rude in that position. After seeing a number of people seated in front of us, we asked about our reservation.  We specified first available when making the call, but multiple parties had been seated immediately upon arriving.  Mercedes explained that we needed to \"check in\" upon arriving, even though the app showed our place in line.  We said that was never explained to us on the call, and Mercedes did not seem to be very concerned.  We had been waiting outside in the heat for more than 40 minutes, and somehow their mistake was made to be our fault.  When we decided to leave because of the mixup, Mercedes was incredibly unprofessional.  Her sarcastic \"Have a nice day!\" was insulting and rude, especially considering it was their mistake.  Sarah, the manager, was nice and said she would address the situation.  We decided it didn't make sense to eat here even if the meal was comped, base on how rude Mercedes was.  I would rather have 2 months of Saturday's detention than eat where she is hosting."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I really like their sweet potato fries. I wish they served more varieties of soda, they only serve regular coke and no other soda varieties."}
{"text":"A good hearty breakfast with excellent service. Early morning outdoor seating was perfect."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Location is next to Blue Hound restaurant - 2ND floor of cityscape."}
{"text":"Husband and I visited here the first morning of our Honeymoon and we LOVED it!! We chose to sit outside near the misters and it was fabulous.  We had the Huevos Con Masa (the cornbread was AMAZING) and the Bello Bene. Drinks, along with food, were awesome and we would DEFINITELY recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Offers such an interesting menu, we had a hard time choosing. I had the Huevos con Masa for breakfast - was soo amazing! My daughter enjoyed the Salted Carmel French Toast! And took a coffee to go! Waitstaff was very helpful, friendly and polite. Will absolutely stop in again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I work in the area so I go to Breakfast Club several days a week for lunch. I love this place. The eggs Benedict are fantastic if you are in the mood for breakfast or the southwest salad if you want lunch. The staff is super friendly so sitting at the breakfast bar is a great option. The kiosk they opened is a great way to get fast drinks and a quick lunch at a good price. I definitely recommend Breakfast Club for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"This is not quality of restaurant it once was. We celebrated Fathers Day here and the food was horrible. The potatoes tasted like they were from a frozen bag. The food came out almost cold. It just didn't have that home cooked taste at all. The biscuits were very dry. Our servicer was just as bad, we had to remind her of bring the cream for our coffee, we had to ask for pancake syrup, we had to ask for strawberry jam twice. The water was served with barely any ice. Just an overall bad experience, and they weren't even busy! We will never be back"}
{"text":"I had eggs Benedict but substituted the ham for tomato. Everything was fresh and delicious. The only issue I had was with the service. The service was slow and not very welcoming. The food made up for the lack of personality that the waitress had."}
{"text":"The service was top notch, however the food was just okay. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Great looking place, very modern decor. Large glass windows enable the sun to shine in and provide a great view if the outdoor mall. We were seated in less then four minutes. Service was great even thought it got packed fast.  I had the caprese omelet, with potatoes and fresh fruit. It was very good. The fresh squeezed apple juice was amazing. And my kiddos had the chocolate chip pancakes, which they had no idea were wheat! I also snuck in a iced coffee which I must say was the best one I've had yet!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is great.  Cost = Reasonable.  Service is usually speedy.  Bloody Mary's are not bad :)   You can get your parking validated so don't be afraid to park in the garage (this is important for those of us who are making the trekk downtown from South Phoenix/Laveen.)  There is a great variety on the menu for even the most picky eaters."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly staff.  I'm a regular here.  It does get VERY crowded during the lunch rush, so going right at noon isn't a great idea.  If you come right at noon, you'll be waiting for a bit as this is a popular spot for the local people.  We usually show up before 11:45 for lunch and don't have to wait more than a few minutes."}
{"text":"During a stay in Phoenix for a conference tried this place out. We ate breakfast here two days that is how good it is. I enjoyed tha variety of selections from small plates to very filling otions. A must try is the border bowl! It is a pork lovers dream, bacon, sausage, ham and chile verde carnitas. All mixed with scrambled eggs with peppers over hash browns. It is an explosion of flavors! Also they have iced coffees and smoothies, I had the BC Iced latte it was caramel and hazlenut goodness."}
{"text":"The name of the place is what attracted us to look at the menu during our 3 day visit to Phoenix, we went for Sunday Brunch on my birthday and at the end of the meal they brought me cake! The food was good and the service was excellent, a younger crowd but family friendly. It was so good in fact we went back again on Monday morning!"}
{"text":"The yoga pants on the waitstaff of this place is just beyond belief. A+++"}
{"text":"I love breakfast food and was told this is the place to get it. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and it was terrible. It was more grease that gravy. I had to hold back throwing up. The potatoes that come with it were great but they did not hit the spot and I had to run to CVS to grab a snack to hold me over till dinner.   Skip this place, go to Matt's Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"The wait at both locations can be atrociously long especially on the weekends so be prepared! Both sites have a full coffee bar and great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here two days in a row. Inside yesterday, outside today.  Great breakfast...hot coffee...friendly staff in a pretty setting.  A real winner!  Great find downtown Phoenix.  AWESOME"}
{"text":"Great food, and great service. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for good brunch and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"So, my sister and her family were in town, and got a good deal @ the downtown Hyatt.  CityScape is close, and they went to breakfast @ The Breakfast Club on Friday morning.  My sister is on a very strict dietary regimen, and they were able to accommodate her with a side of broccoli for breakfast.  So, she wanted to go back there for breakfast on Saturday.  I am always up for trying new things, especially breakfast.  And I'm pretty sure this place made a \"best of\" list I'd recently read.  So I agreed...despite my deep desire to go to Matt's.  I wanted to support my sister and her quest for better health, so I took one for the team.  Our server was fabulous.  She was efficient and remembered my sister's dietary needs from the previous day.  That's why they get 2 stars.  I found the setting quite generic.  The selection of pancakes/waffles/french toast was not at all tempting.  I got the basic eggs/bacon/toast/fruit combo with a side of potatoes.  Food came promptly, and was ok.  This is what really bothered me.  There were no condiments on the table without request.  My toast was dry, so thank goodness they asked if I wanted any jam when they took my order.  I know some people like their toast dry.  But I like mine with butter.  REAL BUTTER.  They asked if we wanted any hot sauce or ketchup.  We said \"yes.\"  They brought us an assortment of hot sauces, and a tray with 4 little dishes of ketchup.  Nobody wanted any ketchup, so that was so much waste of time, energy and product.  This place is VERY generic.  I will not be returning, because there are so many more interesting and locally-owned options for breakfast downtown.  Oh, and Faux News does not help the atmosphere...just saying..."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go breakfasts for a meeting at our office. I called in at 6:50 am and asked for a 7:45 am pickup. We were there at 7:45 am. We got our food at 8:17!!! THEY WERE 32 MINUTES LATE! Completely unacceptable and they didn't even offer a comp or even a discount for their horrible service. Some of the orders were wrong, too, which I expected because sit-down restaurants are never great at to-go. However, when you've got customers who are already angry and the manager is now the one who is finally getting the food, it would be a good idea to check the orders before you bring them out to the customer.   I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The turkey wrap and the eggs are amazing. Staff always very nice also."}
{"text":"Since Blue Hound stopped serving breakfast, we tried this. Not worth it, especially when there are so many other MUCH BETTER places downtown, like Fez, Bliss/Rebar, Matt's Big Breakfast, and the Vig. Also, don't look up at the television screens - I'll take my eggs without the side of conspiracy theory."}
{"text":"Pro: quick service, lots of veggies in the Lean & Green omelette. Cons: said veggies cooked in so much oil I had to use the toast I subbed for the potatoes to blot each bite. Server never checked on me so just gave feedback at the end of the meal. Someone ordering something called \"lean\" & subbing dry toast for potatoes is not looking for an oily mess. Coffee not hot & not great, either. Too bad, cute place & nice location next to hotel, but will be looking for something else for the next 2 mornings of my stay in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am not sure what I expected from the breakfast club. I guess breakfast. Just heard  a lot about it but just went for the first time. The menu was just a normal breakfast  menu. So, ok, maybe expecations was high but whatever.  Had the burrito with the churrizo which did nothing for me whatesoever. The waffle was to die for. The servers were frinedly and all the staff including the managers and hostesses seemed happy and that they wanted to be there. We will be back"}
{"text":"OK, so I've been here twice. While the presentation of the food and the service was good, there was one problem. Both times I came here I found HAIR in my food. The first time it happened, I said to myself, things happen you know. It made me lose my appetite but I wasn't completely upset. However, the second time that it happened did it for me. I'm completely turned off. I will not return to this location. Maybe I'll try the one in Scottsdale when I visit again. Hope I will have better luck receiving a hairless meal at a different location!"}
{"text":"Visited the CityScape location and sat at the bar. We had a delicious meal and exceptional service. I had an issue with my gift card and the manager, Ernie, worked with me and took care of it. Our server was Alexis and she was attentive & courteous. As matter of fact we even came back the next morning & brought friends. Delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really like this place and the lovely ladies at the counter.  Pretty fast service for someone who needs to grab a bite on the way to work downtown or for lunch.  They have GREAT smoothies.  Ask for the Buzz Lightyear.  YUM!!"}
{"text":"Usually I love the Breakfast Club, but during my last 3 visits. The staff has been slow, not attentive and my food has been brought to me cold. It's disappointing considering I've had many good experiences here. I hope they make some improvements because overall this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I have honestly never written a 1 star review of anywhere in Arizona, but have to after an experience I had today. I cannot offer any review of the food, because we never received food. We did not even receive customer service because that would require that a restaurant acknowledges you. So this review is based off of a lack of customer service as well as an observation of the state of the kitchen.   I originally walked up to the to-go area and the woman working there was pleasant and directed me to the restaurant for food. This is where the positive story ends. I went to the restaurant to meet my boss who is an executive at a nonprofit in Arizona. When she walked in the door, there was water on the floor so she slipped and fell on the ground. Thankfully she was not injured, and made her way to my table. We sat, for literally 25 minutes, and were never acknowledged, given water, eye contact, or a chance to order. A manager never came to inquire if she was okay, though we did see them attempt to wipe up the floor. It was not especially busy and the restaurant was well staffed. There were tables on both sides of us with businessmen getting prompt service, drinks, and food orders. Literally every other occupied table in the restaurant had a man and each of them were getting drinks and food. Maybe I missed a sign on the door of this prehistoric establishment and they only serve men?! We could not so much as make eye contact with any of the servers. We could see into the kitchen and were disturbed to see water pouring out of a vent in the ceiling and an inch of thick dust/grime atop one of the kitchen appliances. The front door of the restaurant was also opened even though it was hot and humid outside. (This is a health code violation.) We will be in touch with our contact at Maricopa County Environmental Health Services to report the water on the floor and in the kitchen, as well as the open door.   After 10 minutes of no service we joked we would only have time for coffee prior to another meeting we had at CityScape. After 25 minutes we exited out the door without even an acknowledgement or apology. A truly confusing, disturbing, frustrating, and time wasting experience! I would never ever recommend this establishment to anyone. Maybe if you're a businessman you will get service!"}
{"text":"Great food, HUGE portions, great service! We got the green chili chicken omelet, breakfast grilled cheese, and my daughter got \"the bird\". We all needed to go bags since we couldn't finish. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast place right below our hotel. It was busy but after 5 minutes we got a table and drinks ordered right after we sat down. Love the biscuits and gravy that are on the spicy side. Hubby loved his big egg breakfast. Friendly waitress who filled up our drinks throughout! This is not our first time and will be back."}
{"text":"Fluffiest omelettes! Wild Mushroom for me and my man gobbled down the Whole Hog - both were beyond our expectations.  Potatoes O'Brien were a nice surprise and our fresh fruit was really fresh."}
{"text":"Huevos Rancheros were muy bueno! It is possible that it was the weather, the patio, the Sunday afternoon relaxation that factored in but it was a great experience. The service was great the green chili on the Huevos Rancheros was fantastic (make sure and ask for a side of the queso). I have a soft spot for green chili as some of my family have \"secret recipes\" that are hard to beat. It's really nice to be able to sit and enjoy the weather of Phoenix in what is beginning to be a REAL downtown, with real viable businesses. It's exciting to see our downtown start to take on new life."}
{"text":"Really awesome breakfast. This is in the Hotel Palomar on the Cityscape, but I think it's a tenant not affiliated with the hotel. I ate there two mornings in a row.  First day was Huevos Rancheros, which I'd rate B+. Nothing bad about it, but the flavors didn't quite click together for some reason.  Second day I had some ultimate french toast that was the best french toast I've ever eaten. It don't remember the name, but it will be easy to spot it on the menu.  Excellent bacon, coffee and service, too.  I wish we had one of these in my hometown. On second thought, maybe that's not a good idea for my waistline."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT - many options from sweet to savory and healthy to decadent. Service was friendly, quick and efficient.   Holding a spot on the waiting list via Yelp saved 15+min of waiting at the restaurant. My first use of this feature... I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food looked great, but I prefer ihop more and ihop prices are a bit better. It was a good atmosphere, but I wasn't too impressed with the food. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but compared to comparable places, It wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Hubby & I stopped here on our way out of town on Jan 2nd. We ate at the Arrogant Butcher a couple of weeks prior and decided to stop back at City Scape to try the Breakfast Club after reading a lot of good reviews.  We were seated quickly...always a plus. Drink order taken within a few minutes. Ordered our food after our drinks arrived ... total time seated... maybe 10 min. Not too shabby huh?? Our food arrived not too long after that.  I ordered the BC Signature French Toast, which is totally out of the norm for me but something about fruit that morning sounds delish. Now, fruit usually turns me off at restaurants because it turns out to be just ok and slightly mushy. My plate of yummy goodness was huge!! 3 large pieces of toast with tons of nuts and fruit and just the right amount of powdered sugar. I'm also not a big butter fan but the butter they provided was good. I'm also not a huge syrup fan but it had great flavor. (I know, why did I order french toast again? LOL) Man, I'm so glad I ordered this. The fruit was perfect. I could not finish everything and it kind of made me sad because it was just THAT good. I shared with hubby because that's what good wifey's do, right?  Hubby had the Huevos Rancheros and practically inhaled it. Need I say more?  Service was great. Hubby's coffee was refilled a few times. It was only was empty once when a big rush of people came in. No biggie.  We definitely will be back. We plan on taking our teens with us next time. And yes, I plan on ordering the french toast again. :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast. Waitress recommendations were spot on. BC French Toast and The Bird omelette A+ choices."}
{"text":"Lean and green was too damn yummy to be on the healthy side of the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!! My family came down to visit my God-daughter at ASU. This breakfast spot is the best in the city!!!! Even on a Sunday the wait time was minimal. Mimosa's were excellent! Nick was the the best waiter we could have asked for! Very proficient! Not only did he know the menu he knew how good the food really was!!! He even got us some togo waters!!! Thanks to him we'll definitely be back!!! Five-stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a QUICK and GOOD lunch in downtown Phoenix. Always enjoy sitting at the bar and meeting new people. Service is actually quicker there as well. My all time favorite is the breakfast grilled cheese sandwich - AWESOME. Free drink refill to go is also a nice touch. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Was at the courthouse sitting in on a case and this place came up on friends phone. So glad we tried. Great food and quick!!"}
{"text":"All the food was excellent, prepared exactly to specifications (and we had a few picky eaters). Service was absolutely incredible. Drinks refilled as soon as they were finished, boxes for leftovers immediately provided, coffee refills to go. Will definitely be back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"The eggs are good and bacon is outstanding Applewood smoked.  Coffee tastes like folgers are something on the low end of things,  which is surprising since it is a coffee house. We have been here twice and both times they have screwed up the orders.  Maybe screening employees for basic memory skills vs do they look good in JLO skin tight pants would be a start.  Eggs are good hot or warm, but each time we have had to wait for the screw ups and they are cold.  Keep looking if you want both service and good food."}
{"text":"This was a basic breakfast and not one to write home about. I had the French toast and it was bland. You'd think it would blow my mind by the description on the menu, but NO! I make much better at home. The two stars are for the ambiance, indoor/outdoor seating and their barista coffee drinks. My hubby ordered a southwestern omelette that he later regretted it and he typically loves omelettes. They could do better here."}
{"text":"Really great food. I had the breakfast burrito, and mom had the waffle. Service was excellent. Even gave us a to-go cup full of freshly brewed coffee. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions. The first time, I got the border bowl which was good but way too much for just me! Totally shareable. The service was just eh but the latter was amazing! The milk is steamed to perfection and the espresso is yummy! I wanted to come back again to better my experience before I wrote this review. Today I got another amazing latte, and way better service. I ordered the quick start which was simple but all that I needed. After my last experience, I think this is my favorite breakfast spot I've found in Phoenix so far."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Phoenix and I was directed to The Breakfast Club by a staff member at The Renaissance Hotel.  I was with 3 hungry men and they also loved this place.  We started with bloody Mary's and mimosas.  The Bloody Mary was very well proportioned with vodka to homemade vegetable juice.  Great spices and rimmed with celery salt. My friend loved his first mimosa served large in a pint glass.  Perfect for a big man!  For breakfast I ordered the Huevos Con Masa.  The first bite of the cornbread blew me away.  Soft, chewy and so flavorful.  Start adding the flavors of the queso and fried eggs and you have one amazing treat!  The guys raved about the border bowl and the quick start loaded.  I may go back tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Nice setting...decent space and size so you don't have to wait. Service was good, no complaints. Signature French toast was good. Otherwise, The rest of the food was above average but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The menu has so many different items to choice from. I got the smoked salmon lox benn. It's like a lox and bagel but on an English muffin and eggs Benedict on top of the salmon. So good. The potatos were good as well.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place in downtown, this is our go to on Sundays and we always sit at the bar.  Even though we have been going here for sometime, I have never had the bene.  I had it today and it was very good.  They make great cocktails, screwdrivers, bloody marys' and mimosas. They squeeze their juice fresh and it is delicious.  Service is excellent here too, very friendly and accommodating and they also have a great patio."}
{"text":"Breakfast Club seemed like the kind of place people go on business trips, not the kind of place people take their friends when they come to visit from out of town.   Generic breakfast place that is good for groups, moderately priced, and open early. My friends and I went here because they opened at 6am. The location is kind of weird (it's above the arrogant butcher) and the food was OK.  Service was good and there were a lot of options."}
{"text":"The setting and atmosphere are really nice.  The service was so-so, as they couldn't explain menu items.  The food was okay but nothing to get excited about.  I had the lox omelette which was too dry and too salty (lox doesn't have to be really salty).  It was supposed to come with creme freche but instead came with ketchup (see comment on service above).  My two friends were also unimpressed.    The Breakfast Club has the right ingredients but the preparation and delivery falls short."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of breakfasts on the road while traveling over the past 20 years, but the Breakfast Club was one of the absolute best I can recall.  I sat at the bar since I was by myself and received excellent service - continual coffee refills and check on how I was doing.  Based on the advice of my server, I had the Border Bowl and it was spectacular.  Huevos Rancheros is a typical go to dish for me, but this dish was even better.  Finding the restaurant was one of the only challenges.  The CityScape complex fills a full block, and the restaurant is on the second level in the middle of the block.  There is access from either Central Ave or 1st St."}
{"text":"Ended up here because Matt's Big Breakfast was packed.  Grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered steak and eggs.  I never realized that a 4 oz steak is miniscule.  I made a comment to the server and she replied \"well, it is a filet\".  Hey, I know that filets come in larger portions.  So they overcompensate by giving you 4 eggs and a pile of potatoes.  All in all, the food was good and the service was great.  It's worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. Wish the portions were smaller at times but for others that may be a plus."}
{"text":"Love love love the Breakfast Club!!! Have never had a bad breakfast there in several trips!! Outdoor seating in February was perfect and amazing for this Midwesterner that escaped the winter from hell to visit AZ!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found the Breakfast Club while in Phoenix for a conference. We arrived around 10:15 on a Sunday morning. While there was a wait for outdoor seating, we were seated right away inside.   Our server was friendly and attentive. The menu has a great selection of brunch and lunch items. I opted for the breakfast burrito with chorizo queso. It was massive and jam packed with chorizo, scrambled egg, black beans and lettuce. It was served with o'brien potatoes and a skewer of fresh fruit. I made it about 2/3 through and handed the rest over to my husband to finish.  He ordered the border bowl which was also a large portion and loaded with meat. Everything was very reasonably priced for the portion size.   Coffee was good and they have your standard coffee bar selections, and again, reasonably priced. They had a nice selection of brunch cocktails including a Bloody Mary with housemade V-18 juice - will have to try next time.  The place was packed, but service was quick!"}
{"text":"Second time in three days.  Craving bacon pancakes.  They are amazing while eating your mouth becomes a symphony.  If the pancakes are a indication of what they have to offer the rest if the menu should be great.  By the way you can load anything (on the menu) you want into the pancakes or waffles."}
{"text":"First thing before ANYTHING... Breakfast Grilled Cheese... O! M! G! YUMMM!  ok, so the service is amazing. Very friendly and inviting. Lots of room for you to enjoy your breakfast, especially the Breakfast Grilled Cheese. So good!   I'll be back for more. Next time, I need to try something else... maybe. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. Southwest bowl was great.  Quick start was a non start.  Carton eggs, Denny's quality bacon.  Toast that isn't actually toasted.  Come on guys, it isn't that hard."}
{"text":"My first visit here and the service isn't that great to begin with. I ordered a traditional biscuits and gravy which is hard to mess up and it was terrible. It was like corn bread and basically no gravy. The hype of this place is definitely not worth it. If you do come here I would say stick with traditional pancakes and eggs."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Good selection of healthy choices and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to try Breakfast Club for lunch. Great ambiance for downtown Phoenix. Ordered the Chicken Caesar and it came with sweet potato fries. Good food. Great setting but really slow on service."}
{"text":"A delightful breakfast spot! They take all of your favorite breakfast classics (omelettes, benedicts, etc.) and jazz them up with huge portions and custom flavors. Don't miss an opportunity to enjoy a hot coffee drink or fancy breakfast cocktail!"}
{"text":"We order the french toast.. biscuits and gravy nd the traditional eggs benedict the food was very delicious the  service was great"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for lunch yesterday. Not a good meal. The BC dip was burnt. BLT was cold. Sweet potato fries cold and soggy. For what I paid for two sandwiches, no excuse for it to be bad.  Got a response from business. I was told if I brought this to the attention of the server, they would have made it right.  What part of this was a takeout order was not understood?"}
{"text":"I am updating my review since I have visited the BC and had another incident that you folks should be aware of... Fraud and theft.  My friends and I enjoyed our lunch and we thought nothing of it. We all left fair tips and went about our day. Two of my friends and I threw our receipts away without verifying the correct amount had posted to our bank accounts (we all either used debit or credit cards). Our other friend balances her accounts monthly and noticed that our server had changed the tip amount after we left! She made a $2 tip into a $3 tip! $1 isn't a big deal but it is fraudulent behavior and it is theft. I'm sure it adds up. It could have happened to all four of us that day but three of us didn't do our due diligence and check our accounts!  My friend contacted the BC and spoke with Gino, the manager. He took the information and then asked if my friend wanted her $1 back. Well, it's not worth driving all the way down there to get $1.   I won't post the server's name but everyone beware! We don't know if she will remain employed at the BC but you can never be too safe! If I were the manager, this behavior would not be tolerated. It hurts the reputation so badly. Check your receipt and your bank account after you dine here. Now I certainly will not be returning."}
{"text":"The staff and specially one of the manager (the big guy) are very rude. The customer service in this location is awful. For an overpriced place they have a very poor customer service, two young school kid with out being trained in customer service are placed in front of the door. You want good breakfast go to kaleidoscope which is close to breakfast club and have much better food with great customer service. Definitely not worth any star!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The wait was kinda long but had a few drinks while we waited so that made it ok. The portions are huge and was super delish. Mimosas are made from fresh squeezed oranges! Can't go wrong with that!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a business trip and looked around for a good convenient place to have a good breakfast and i found it best breakfast spot in downtown Phoenix!!! Sitting area outside is amazing and servers are great. Great menu!!! Walking distance from Marriott hotel."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed. My friend took me here as a belated bday brunch. The waitress got my order wrong, even though we had a lengthy discussion about it.  My food was lukewarm, as was my hot cocoa. They never brought us water.  Our waitress didn't ask us ONCE how everything was, but was quick to want to take away plates that we weren't even finished with. The worst part is it wasn't even busy! They didn't get ONE thing right, nor were they particularly friendly. I'll pass and stick with the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Great location, open and airy atmosphere and friendly wait staff tee up this interesting, flavorful and healthy ish breakfast stop. If it were a real club I'd join in a heartbeat.   Huevos rancheros over cornbread...wow  Fresh squeezed juices...yummy  This is a spot worthy of a visit"}
{"text":"It was sooook yummmmy and the waiter was Amazing!!! Tony was Amazing and it was a pleasure dining here! It's a great full menu with pots of options! The view is so nice and the we got our food extremely fast. They also are great at customizing the menu to get exactly what you want. Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Two Thumbs up you cant really go wrong here not to long of a wait good service, good proportions, good food i could start my mornings here any day of the week"}
{"text":"Best egg omelets! Plus the waffle was delicious too. Great outdoor doing too and friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Went for a downtown lunch while performing my civic duty with a group of 8. We got there at the beginning of the usual \"lunch hour\" and we lucked out because we didn't have to wait. They were quick, the food was great, and they didn't make any grunts when we requested split checks. There is one person in our group who was forgotten and had to wait for about 5 minutes more for his food than the rest of us but it wasn't any error on the part of our server.  I got a wrap and an iced tea and it was delish, perfect amount for lunch without leaving you feeling too heavy."}
{"text":"Where to begin. Got a fresh great waffle with southern fried chicken. Everything I could ask for. The chicken was juicy and crispy. Then got the chile braised shredded chicken with side of bacon and potatoes obrien. The shredded chicken was so deep with great flavors. Fresh squeezed oj in the mimosas. When i travel back to Phoenix I will be back to this establishment. And with outdoor seating it's wonderful. Friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I had the French Toast and my fiance had the grilled cheese and we both loved it."}
{"text":"Was staying right next for a extended stay.  This was a go to place for me after a few days and the servers learned what I wanted and I didn't even have to remind them.  Nice to feel welcome while traveling and have a sense of home.  The food was good and the fresh squeezed juice was a my daily indulgence.. I enjoyed meeting some of their other regulars and really enjoyed the service and atmosphere.   Definitely worth a stop.   Alas, I never tried the lunch, but from some of the comments on here, I missed a few things.  Next time... Thanks Jimmy and Mark for making my mornnings a little brighter!"}
{"text":"I went here for the 3rd Breakfast Club UYE of the year. High five to Monica O. for picking a great place. A little bit of a crazy start, adventures in the parking garage and a lost reservation, but after they got a table set up for us everything went good from there. Great service. Nice table that was half inside and half outside. Great day to be outside. Don't think it would work to well in July though. Awesome food. I got the blueberry pancakes. They were as big as my face and so good. Couldn't stop eating them but couldn't finish them either. I also tried potatos O'Brian which I had never had before. Breakfast potatoes with grilled onions and peppers. That was really good as well. I really liked that they had homemade syrup and that they put it in a olive oil bottle with the spout. Great idea. Really nice restaurant too. Very clean. I will be back. Not only to try and conquer the pancakes but also to try other things on the menu some of which my fellow breakfasters got. There were some good looking plates on that table. Great breakfast place in downtown Phoenix. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"\"Hey suga, want some sugar? How about some powdered sugar? And maybe some syrup?\" - My waffles.   I ordered the nutty waffles, which are described as coming with toasted almonds, candied walnuts and my choice of syrup/honey. The candied walnuts were nowhere to be found - instead my waffle was covered with regular walnuts, a mound of white grain sugar, some scliced almonds and also a pile of powdered sugar. My teeth fell out looking at it.  I literally dummped these bad boys upside down to dust off all the sugar and then carefully place my naked walnuts on top.   I hope no one eats this for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food and coffee. Was there with friends on a Sunday morning. All of our food had very large portions! If you're not a big eater, I suggest you split an entree.  The service was fast and friendly. The prices were well worth the amount of food you get. I loved my iced coffee!"}
{"text":"great service, great food! loved the ambience. highly recommend the \"Border Bowl\".  Not much more to say!"}
{"text":"This spot  s located at the CityScape, on the upper level. They have both stairs and escalators from the sidewalk. It had a small seating right in front of it. But then, they had more outdoor seating under the yellow Sunbrellas behind the cafe structure. I walked into the restaurant and got a seat at the bar, since I was alone.   They had a good amount of seating at the bar, also lots of indoor seating as well. It was not as busy as I thought, which was good for me since I got to get a seat right away. The hostess was friendly and nice, welcomed me with a warm smile as soon as I walked in.  I ordered an interesting item that is called \"V-18\" which is their version of Veggie Juice. The V-18 came out in a deep, bright red, like a typical V-8 drink. The large was really large, the same size as their big water glass. It was very strong and powerful, I tasted mainly tomato, with some veggies. It woke me right up with a good amount of spice. Tasty, high quality and very filling.  For food, I chose Biscuits & Gravy. This thing was HUGE! I didn't realize how bit it was going to be... The gravy was nice and creamy, didn't have much sausage in it from what I could see. The biscuit had a tiny little kick to it from jalapeno, which was nice. It was fluffy, but at the same time, a bit too dry.  The entire time I was having my breakfast, no one came to check on me.  And because of that, it took a while to get the bill, and to pay the bill. It would be nicer if I didn't feel like I was forgotten at the bar..."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot out in the warm Arizona morning air. The coffee is strong and the food is fantastic. The service was excellent and in the immortal words of Arnold, \"I'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"Good old fashion breakfast. Fast and friendly service. Good value. Good for lunch too. Had the turkey Rueben with the sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Amazing food! A bit pricy for breakfast food but definitely worth it with taste, quality, and portion size! You also can't beat the fact that is right in the heart of downtown! Will be back ASAP"}
{"text":"Great place for a simple healthy breakfast or a more rich tastier bkfast. Everyone was very friendly and we had great food. They even asked if we wanted water to go and gave us bottled water."}
{"text":"So very very mediocre. Really not much else to say. Nothing on the menu pops out. Food was not bad but not memorable either. Blah."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service and a cool design, plus it was cool inside, a necessity even at 9am since it was getting damn hot.  We settled in a comfy booth and took our time perusing the big menu and talking up a storm.  Our lovely server kept the ice water and coffee coming, and kept us topped off during our 90 minute stay.  I chose a delicious egg white veggie omelet (hold the broccoli), my hon of hons husband had traditional eggs Benedict and the lovely Miss Caroline Tierney had the Tuscan omelet.  We were all very happy and satisfied with our choices.  Fresh as can be, ample portions and served with wonderful fresh fruit.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What an absolute horrible dinning experience. Let me set the stage. My husband, 2 small children, and I sit down. We order drinks. An ice tea for my husband, 2 lemonades, and a coffee with cream for myself. Clarification again with the waitress yes, I would like cream with my coffee. She returns with an ice tea in plastic container with a lid for my 30 year old husband and 2 very tall GLASS glasses of lemonade of the 2 and 1 year old children. I then ask, \"can we please have something with a lid\". She replies with a little attitude and \"ok but can I take ur food order first\" as the kids squirm and whine for the delicious lemonade that sits before them. Finally we get the plastic ware after she takes our food order, checks on the table next to us and runs food from the kitchen for another table.   THEN when the food begins to arrive it comes out one plate at a time. 5 minutes apart. But of course forgetting the kids plate. The kids get to share one side of eggs as I regretfully ordered a spicey dish with jalepenos. Had to ask 3 different people for a side plate so my youngest didn't have to eat off the table.   Finally the waitress mumbles she didn't hear we wanted a quick breakfast with the eggs scrambled and piece by piece assembled the breakfast. Eggs, later some fruit, followed by 5 minutes later some bacon, and finally when we were finished with our meal out came the toast.   Never once did our waitress refill our water or coffee (that I had to ask 3x for creamer) and as we signed our card receipt she never once took a plate of food.  Absolutely horrible service!"}
{"text":"Do you desire a huge, tasty breakfast in a super cool space with great service?  Then The Breakfast Club in trendy downtown Phoenix should be tried. Crazy delicious food and drinks, and it's great for people watching.  Even better is that the patio is pooch friendly. You're even offered to-go tea and coffee (the tea comes in the sweetest disposable French press cup for the loose leaf tea - totally cool!!!!). Warning - the food is massive, but it's served with chunks of fruit, so it's slightly healthy."}
{"text":"Easy walk from the Convention center. Stopped for breakfast had The Bird omelette and the Green omelette. Our server even gave us a extra coffee to go."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food is good. The presentation is definitely a 5. I am giving a low rating because my pancake was raw. That wasn't the big deal. What made this upsetting is how they did not make this right. For the price especially, they should've fixed this. Instead, the waitress just apologized and gave us our bill. The service was very, very slow too. I excused this because they were busy,  but still....if they take this long to give me my food, shouldn't it be cooked? And if they make a mistake, which I am understanding of, should they just say sorry and make me pay for something I didn't eat?  Very nice ambience though if you're looking for that."}
{"text":"This is the cutest place in the center of CityScape! We came after the morning brunch lunch. I ordered breakfast and my Mom ordered the berry salad. The food was on point and the service was excellent. They also validate parking which is a plus! I would def. go here again!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how bad this place was considering all the positive reviews it has.  I ordered the breakfast grilled cheese, which given the name and description on the menu, you would think would come with cheese on it. Unfortunately, the only cheese on the sandwich was half a slice of Kraft cheese which was not what I was expecting. Additionally, my coffee cup was horribly dirty and stained on the inside which I didn't notice until I had drank half the cup. It was overall a very unpleasant and disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Always recommended this place to any visitors from out of town. Such good breakfast and lunch, also has the best mimosas. Cute patio area to sit outside as well!"}
{"text":"We were driving around downtown Phoenix & found the Breakfast club through Yelp. Much as anywhere in the area, there is no private parking lot for the restaurant, but since it was a Sunday, there wasn't much of a problem finding street parking. Once seated, we ordered a small fresh squeezed orange juice, a coffee, the Quick Start, the Golden Malted Waffle, the Regular Sweet Cream Pancakes (full order), & the BC Signature French Toast. Overall, the everything was good, nothing that you'd remember to recommend to friends, however. The orange juice was way too sour but the highlights of breakfast were the waffle, french toast, & the bacon from the quick start. The waffle was really light and fluffy, the french toast was also well made (didn't smell egg-y like it does at some other places) and had plenty of berries & nuts, and the bacon was thick cut & tasty. Service was unfortunately a disappointment; it was relatively busy inside and outside the restaurant & when we got there, they had to clear off a table for us, but at no point after we got our food did the waitress come by to ask if everything was good & we had to ask someone else who came to get our plates for the bill. If I happen to be in the area, I might stop by again but I wouldn't make a trip to go eat there."}
{"text":"Great tea, juice & good food  Bar has lousy service so don't sit there unless you like being ignored or having a bill tossed at you (that has not happened to me in my 45 years of living) - and I kindly replied with A $0 tip (I've never done that before either - and my company pays the bill not me so it's not about money at all)  Have had great service outside of bar though!"}
{"text":"I frequently travel to Phoenix for work, and usually end up at Matt's Big Breakfast. I decided to give the Breakfast Club a try on my last visit, and I'm glad I did! My wait to be seated was minimal, service was attentive, prompt and friendly. My order of steak and eggs was quickly brought out and was perfect. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Once I figured out where it was (Climb the steps!) I was treated to a gastronomic delight. I had a breakfast and lunch there, and was very pleased with both, Breakfast burrito was tasty and well presented, and I could not finish it - huge portion! For lunch I had the breakfast bowl - don't ask me why - and this too was very tasty, a large portion, and I'd order it again. Staff was very friendly and accommodated my requests as to how to split the bill without issue. Very friendly place!"}
{"text":"Freshly squeezed orange juice is hard to find and they deliver! Great tasting yogurt with berries and granola - I'd rather have granola without cinnamon but it wasn't overwhelming. Eggs cooked perfectly and 9 grain toast was great. Already buttered but not soaked. All for $15.75"}
{"text":"Great location. Very clean. Service is excellent. Nice staff. Karissa our waitress was exceptional. Food ready in minutes. Awesome menu."}
{"text":"My last experience at The Breakfast Club will be just that, my last.  Living downtown I try and support downtown business and frequent establishments within walking distance of my condo.  I've had a few positive experiences here and  more than a few negative experiences, but my girlfriend likes the place (or she used to anyway) so when she comes downtown for the weekend we make the trek here.    The food is average, somethings are well done (good Bennies), some you could get just as good or better almost anywhere.  I can name at least 5 breakfast places in Phoenix that I feel have better food at a more competitive price.  The drinks used to be what kept me coming back, as I felt this place had one of the best Bloody Mary's in town.  My last experience here was a total let down and I should have known something was up when our server asked if we wanted \"spicy\" or \"non-spicy\" when we ordered our drinks, a question that has never been asked once in the nearly 2 years I've been ordering drinks here.  My \"non-spicy\" tasted totally different than anything I've been served there, and not in a good way.  My girlfriend's \"spicy\" tasted like someone added a pound of horseradish to it.  The drinks are also way over priced, $10 for a large and $7 for a small, I have no problem paying premium price for a premium product, but these no longer fit in that category.    The staff is what solidified my decision to cross this off the list of places I frequent as I've only read about service this horrible and never actually experienced it myself until now.  I'll start off by saying the service at the Downtown Breakfast Club has always been hit or miss, with many more misses than hits.  Some of the waitstaff has been very good, most has been not so good.  I'm really not that hard to wait on....take my order, bring me my food, refill my water, check in once to see if everything is OK and you can expect a good tip.  To illustrate my last visit here's a timeline:  Checked in with hostess for party of 2, was told 20-30 minutes.  Waited almost an hour and watched a total lack of control or caring as people would just walk up and seat themselves at the outdoor seating and nothing would be said by the staff.  If the outdoor seating is a free for all like sitting at the bar just let me know and I'll seat myself.  Finally had a table, waited 10-15 minutes before our server came over.  Luckily we knew what we wanted so we ordered our drinks and food right away.  Bloody Mary's took about 15 minutes to get to us and food was another 20-25.  Once the food arrived we asked for ketchup, which I feel is a fairly simple request, and the server said she would be right back with it.  Apparently right back to her means 15 minutes and when she appeared with it and we total her to forget about it since we were already 80% done with our food she seemed a bit put off that we would have the audacity to ask for something and not bow at her feet when she got around to getting it to us.    Was the food good, would you like more water, can I get you anything else??  Don't ask our server because she wouldn't know, not once did anyone stop by our table and ask even one of these basic questions.   My advise to the owner of this establishment would be kill it with fire.  This location is destroying your brand and had I never been to the Scottsdale location I would never have given this one as many chances and I have.  I would rather eat stale Fruity Pebbles with month old milk then eat here again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant right in the middle of it all.   We went last Sunday and had a great experience.  Lots of varieties and very knowledgeable on their gluten free options.  All of the items my party ordered were tasty and large portions.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. I took my daughter and we both had Bacon. The bacon was very limp. There was no crisp at all. $8 got me 2 sunny side up eggs (which the white was not cooked all the way through either) and a piece of toast. My daughter got a grilled cheese with bacon and hash Browns. Her Bacon was very much undercooked as well. She didn't eat her hash Browns since they were soggy, Not even a toasty edge in it. So I basically paid $7.50 for a grilled cheese (which was more bread than cheese) for her. Her lemonade was to Sour no sweet for me. She liked it though. The frozen coffee was good. That was the only good thing out of the $25 it cost for breakfast for the two of us(not including the tip). It was not the waitresses fault that the cook is in the wrong profession."}
{"text":"The portions are humongous! We will recommend sharing!  I ordered the turkey omelette. It came with potatoes and fruit. I honestly did not like the turkey, it was just too much turkey. Everything else was delicious.   My fianc√© ordered the biscuit and grits with over easy eggs. He loved it and the biscuit was spicy just how he likes it.   The staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We were here for brunch this past weekend, and to my surprise as it is in many downtown Phoenix restaurants, it wasn't half bad. I had the Lox and my boyfriend has some waffles.   I was a bit disappointed my Salmon wasn't smokey enough for my taste but other than that service was great.  It was crazy packed we did have to wait for about twenty minutes."}
{"text":"Met friends for breakfast on my last day in Phoenix. By far this is the best place and best priced for a full breakfast. Eggs Benedict, perfect ! Grill cheese with egg and potato on sourdough, perfect! French toast, perfect. Don't forget to order hot tea, delicious. One more thing, this place is affordable."}
{"text":"One of the best Benedict's I've had. I ordered the mushroom Benedict * (not sure exact name on menu) and enjoyed every bite! The mushrooms were super juicy, the hollandaise was creamy and the perfect amount of sweet! My second egg was over done but they brought me out a new plate fast, without question and left the overdone benedict for the table to munch on - the mushrooms were too good to let go to waste). The bloody Mary was also delicious. Spicy and not too filling - a perfect pair for any brunch. I am an avid bloody mary seek and drinker - I'd give this a 3.75 out of 5 - worth a try if you like spicy!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure at first about eating at this place because it's with in business buildings and you can't see it from the street. They have escalators when you reach the top their it is. We put ourselves on a wait list prior to going there. When we got there we checked in and waited about 10-minutes The place was busy, but wait the service was quick the food excellent the staff was awesome. We were a party of 6 and we all tried something different I had a breakfast burrito with the green chili pork on top and asked for salsa poured it on top and it was phenomenal. We had oat meal that was a bit strange looking because it had bell pepper slices in it but it to was amazing. We had another dish of chicken fried chicken also amazing and huevos  con masa also amazing! My flavor pallet was well satisfied. Before leaving I stop at there coffee kiosk and got a black iced tea to go even the tea was the freshest and most amazing Great portion reasonable priced it's a must eat if your ever in the area."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ for a long weekend, no other breakfast place was needed. With its great location at CityScape, great outdoor dining area, and fresh menu, you can't go wrong. Over three mornings we had French toast, breakfast grilled cheese, turkey  BLT, pancakes, and the whole hog omelet. Highly recommend all of them, especially the french toast and turkey BLT with sweet potato fries. The fresh squeezed juices are a real treat, too. Build your own mimosa for $25 is pretty enticing. Breakfast Club is a must visit in DTPHX."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food was amazing and the service was top notch! Will definitely be coming back here next time we're around."}
{"text":"Great find for yummy breakfast! We are visiting from out of town and found this restaurant on YELP Zander decided to give it a try. The service was very good as their waiters/ host staff were very friendly and attentive. I ordered the turkey club with avocado/bacon and a side cup it tomato soup. The soup was light and had hints of red pepper. Rodney had the steak and eggs. We both enjoyed the Bloody Marys. They serve very generous portions so you can contemplate sharing as well. A fun find in downtown Phoenix! Yumm!!!"}
{"text":"Water tastes like they got it from a toilet. Eggs tasted like the water. Bland food. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"There is a reason why it is a quick wait to sit down.... because the wait for quality service and food will be endless. If you're expecting the Scottsdale Breakfast Club, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tasty food, friendly service.  Even with the address, not easy to find if you're driving, best to call and get an exact location of where they are.  I had \"The Bird\" omelet. Everything was warm except for the avocado, which was almost ice cold. We sat indoors where it was cooler, but they left the doors wide open - so, my hope of not having to dine with flies was dashed. My coffee was bitter - perhaps do to it being the end of the lunch rush.   I'd consider going back, but probably earlier in the day and request they close the doors."}
{"text":"Can't give fair rating, it's my 1st time here. Wasn't impressed with my huevos rancheros..too much going on, on plate. I prefer simple rancheros (made for breakfast).  Beans, eggs, and chili did have good flavor.  Staff was great, quick & pleasant."}
{"text":"Great place to get breakfast in downtown PHX. Indoor, outdoor, or at the bars tools. The omelettes are huge and full of flavor. Place is pretty busy (Sunday morning) but the wait was only 5-10 mins."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food and ludicrously large portions. A must-go for breakfast in downtown PHX."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here after a stay a hotel near. Food Was okay, nothing special. Customer service was awesome and ver inviting. The atmosphere was upbeat and a bit loud. The waiters were young with an urban vibe to them. I would probably come back as the food was just okay. I ordered a breakfast combo not sure the name but it included eggs, bacon, potatoes and a jalape√±o biscuit. Coffee was pretty normal as well."}
{"text":"Definitely a high quality breakfast joint with a fun atmosphere. It's about $20 a meal average if you get a side. We were able to watch football at the bar and avoid the 15 minute wait. The service was great and the food was above average. They put fun spins on everyday breakfast items and my favorite thing was definitely the biscuits and gravy side! So yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Such a great breakfast place!! We checked in on Yelp which helped us get seated super fast. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. Our drinks never went empty. The food was superb!"}
{"text":"Gotta say this was surprisingly healthy. I didn't expect to have a fulfilling meal with absolutely no grease and no salt. I was FULLY satisfied and set for the day. The lemonade was perfect. We took lemonade to go just because it was that good. My only suggestion is that you don't expect the best of service. Although the staff had smiles and were personable, it seemed like it was everyone's first day. As I sat and just watched, everyone's order was delivered to the wrong table before finding the right one and everyone's order at each table was given to the wrong person... did I mention that our table was just a table of 2. The table next to us had to ask for their drinks 4 times... no exaggeration. Although I despise bad service, the food is worth the return. They should be happy the Chef is good at what he/she does."}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict's are amazing! This is the first time going there and it did not disappoint. The only frustration I had was finding this place. It is kind of hidden within the City Scape complex. Decent prices and kind employees."}
{"text":"What better place to have a UYE Breakfast Club breakfast than at a restaurant called the Breakfast Club! It was off to a slow start getting a table with miscommunication on our reservation but they found the room to seat our group outdoors, and it was a great morning for it. I ordered the Turkey Bene plate,came with potatoes & fruit and was not disappointed, tasted great, best eggs benedict I've had yet! Some others ordered amazing looking pancakes, one plate looked big enough for 3 people, great deal for your buck! Great place to go if your in downtown Phoenix. p.s. I was so not happy about them not having Diet Coke, but the coffee was good and held me over until I could satisfy that addiction elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really, really like this place!Arrived around 10am and the place was packed. Opted to sit outside to get the full experience. There was a little bit of a wait, but the manager Gino checked on us several times. He's extremely efficient, friendly and animated. He definitely adds to the experience! I ordered the lox, bagels and cream cheese while my bf ordered the bird omelette. Both were great and worth the wait. Service was fast. The only con was our server. She was nice but I never even got her name. She took our order,checked on us once and that was it. She was also busy so I still gave 5 stars! And most importantly can't forget pet friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I had to stop here upon recommendation from my coworkers.  Being from Chicago it was nice to be able to sit down and feel the nice warm air come in from outside.    I had the Waffle with fresh blueberries and a blueberry compote on top.   The meal was great but a little pricey.  For the waffle and a small glass of OJ it was over 16 dollars for breakfast."}
{"text":"I see a lot complaints about the service but on this occasion our service was great. We were greeted promptly by the hostess, the person I assume was the manager and two of the servers. One server even commented on my family's accidently matching attire. Shortly after receiving our menus the server took our drink order.   Things were going well.  Then our food came out. My wife's food was missing some of the ingredients listed on the menu. The server corrected this quickly. Otherwise her french toast order was fine if not, by my tastes, underwhelming. My wife thought it was fine.  I had ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Half of the plate was covered with shredded lettuce. The rest of the plate consisted of black beans, pork green chile and 2 eggs. The green was bland and I would've like to have seen more. The eggs were over done, not runny at all. (sad face here)  Also being a relatively cheap person I had a bit of sticker shock. The OJ was fresh squeezed, my niece had a large and my wife had large mimosa. I didn't feel that their french toast was a good value at $10.  Bottom line is I won't go back and I won't recommend this place. Their are several other downtown breakfast locations that I think are better."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food and their atmosphere. We had a few people pass us while we waited to be seated without acknowledgement, but the wait was minimal. The rest of the service and food was quick. I had the biscuits and gravy which and the BC Bagel and Summer had the Turkey and avocado omelet. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. That said, why use stirring sticks instead of spoons for their coffee when you put ketchup in a fancy cup?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!  Enjoyed eating outdoors! Yummy Mimosa and Bloody Marys! Didn't like having to pay for parking. Otherwise, would eat here again"}
{"text":"The service was great. Brooke took great care of us. We were here visiting and a former student of mine recommended we connect here for breakfast. I'm glad she did. We will visit here again when we are in town.   I am on a modified eating plan and the \"Lean and Green\" helped stay on it, somewhat. (Lol.)"}
{"text":"Their food is always good here, never a disappointment. My husband and I generally sit at the bar for quick service, but they have a great sitting arrangement to enjoy the weekend mornings."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and find myself to be a connoisseur of the mimosa bottle service. Both times I've ordered the green  chicken omelette and also the biscuit and gravy plate. The chili chicken omelette isn't super spicy so it's perfect (I'm sure you can ask it to be made extra spicy). My favorite way of eating the two Entrees are together (lol). I would definitely go back a third time. The only reason I'm giving this place four starts is because of two things: today, when I was there it kind of smelled funny outside- almost like trash but only for a minute here and there. Second reason is because this woman was sitting in front of us and was being harassed by some man that came and sat right next to her and didn't even order food- no one came and told that guy to leave her alone. She came to enjoy her meal alone and couldn't even do that in peace."}
{"text":"You guys...this is the best breakfast I've ever had in my LIFE I kid you not ! I got \"The Bird\" and about died of happiness ! Huge portions !"}
{"text":"The best part of eggs benedict is cutting into that perfectly poached egg and seeing the yolk ooze out and blend with hollandaise sauce over nicely toasted English muffin. Unfortunately, that didn't happen at the Breakfast Club. My table had 4 different benes. The common denominator was an overcooked, almost hard-boiled egg. So shameful in the world of Eggs Benedict lovers.  On top of that, the hollandaise sauce was so thick and tasted like a butter cream. Potatoes were ok but should have more of a crisp.  The good thing about my brunch was that I sat at the tables outside and it was a nice day out. Made me a little more forgiving about the food. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was very hungry when going to The Breakfast Club for the first time. I ordered pancakes with Hash Browns, Sausage, and Bacon. The pancakes did not dissapoint. They were very filling. To the point that I could not finish all the other times I ordered a la carte. The servers were very friendly and quick to make sure our drinks were always refreshed. Overall I had a good experience. Nothing that was out of this world amazing but the quality of food was good and the service was good."}
{"text":"Excellent Soutwest breakfast bowl.  Great service.  Very convenient to downtown hotels."}
{"text":"On a beautiful day in downtown Phoenix my date and I sat outside under an umbrella, sipped excellent coffee, and ate a fabulous Eggs Benedict with Smoked salmon on top. The poached egg was done perfectly, the sauce on top was quite nice, and the capers really set off the flavor. So, good food, good service, in an ideal setting took me back to a little European caf√© that we used to frequent when I was working abroad. What is not to like? To top it off, the prices are very reasonable ... maybe a bit expensive for Phoenix, but on balance, was quite reasonable. Good experience."}
{"text":"Sharp looking place modern meets old dinner, good food nice and simple breakfast menu. Staff could have been more friendly, but over all solid place will be back again!"}
{"text":"More of a solid 3.5 stars.  Despite the heavy rain and huge crowd during Superbowl weekend, we were seated within 10 minutes of arrival.   Since I had quite an eating list to get through and this was just a \"quick bite\" after the gym, we ordered minimally.  The two of us shared their signature French toast, breakfast bagel and a side of bacon.  This place has good bacon. The cuts are girthy, long and perfectly salty. We both enjoyed the French toast though I think it sounded better on paper than its transition into real life. The bagel was okay, good flavor but there was something just amiss. Who knows maybe I needed more bacon..  Overall a commendable effort by the breakfast club."}
{"text":"This place is really cool, and has some great vibes coming from it.  The food is also great too, but the only reason I give it 3 stars is the service.  The manager is really loud, and also the servers are slightly slow and rarely check up on you.  The food comes out a little slower than I hope too.  But, once it does come out, it's great.  If you have the time, and you are with others, I would recommend it, but don't go alone.  You will end up being frustrated."}
{"text":"Normally I am deterred by three star ratings when looking for places to eat, but decided to take a chance and try this place out. I now have been here twice. Great food, big portions and excellent customer service. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Breakfast Club! Breakfast Club! Not just the name of a great 1980s classic, but also the perfect name for a restaurant because it tells me everything I need to know: they serve breakfast, and they're probably going to do it well.   The BC is located in downtown Phoenix's CityScape development, and is super convenient to the Hotel Palomar and the Gold's Gym. They have two store points: one is the main cafe itself, where you have a full-service sit-down restaurant and bar. The other point is a free-standing coffee shop-style location (located right outside), which serves all of their coffee and juice drinks, plus a limited to-go menu of their food items. I happily visited both the cafe and the restaurant a total of two times each during a week-long stay in downtown PHX, so that speaks volumes as to their appeal.  Here are some other basics: there's ample seating indoors and out, and as a solo diner, I appreciated the semi-circle and inviting bar seating area, plus the super-quick service. I love creative lattes and good drip coffee, so I was happy to see that they offer some nice flavors and syrups for their lattes, even more diverse than, say, Starbucks. The drip coffee is also tasty, and they offer both soy and almond milk if you're opposed to cow.  As for the food selection, you have your sundry items from any cafe, from sandwiches to paninis to salads to soups. Everything looked really fresh and appealing, but I was more game for a Southwestern-style breakfast item. I was so torn between the Huevos con Masa and the Huevos Rancheros, but I decided to go with the Rancheros. What was \"right\" about this dish was the preparation of the eggs, the black beans, and the pork green chili, but what could have improved would be to get rid of the flour/chipotle-flavored tortilla in favor for a more authentic corn tortilla option. All in all, it was only $10, plus their hot sauce wasn't limited to boring old red Tabasco (they also had Cholula), so that's a bonus.  The service was great and the menu selections were plentiful enough to please any breakfast/lunch palate. I will definitely be back next time I'm downtown!"}
{"text":"New in town and wanted a breakfast place within walking distance to our apartment. The Breakfast Club filled the bill. Great food, great service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Trying to figure out how this place is getting any good reviews.  Just isn't  good  Eggs brought out were almost raw and inedible Bacon was good English muffin was tough - like it sat under a heat lamp forever Potatoes (which another reviewer raved about) were dry and tasteless.  Small fruit stack garnish was per usual.  French toast - okay.  The service was also below average.  I really wanted this place to be good.   So disappointed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't read the review about the lousy service before coming here. Can't speak for the entire restaurant, but I can definitely confirm that service at the bar stinks. I can only surmise that the have an over abundance of customers and are trying to shoo the excess away or they are quite confident that their food will make people forget about the service. Well....not this customer....too many restaurants serving good food and friendly service to ever bother with this place again...."}
{"text":"one of my favorites in downtown phoenix. attentive service, great coffee, delicious food...  what's there not to like ?!!"}
{"text":"A must place to go for bfast, great food and service was super good.  Sever Nicholas... super nice  we sat outside...  real nice and comfy.    My wife and I are out of towners from DC visiting AZ.  If you are visiting and staying downtown go here folks."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning. Great location.Very prompt and friendly service. Sat at the counter and they had all the doors open since it is a beautiful morning. Had \"The Bird\" omelette and it was delicious. Portions are large and very high quality. Would highly recommend this restaurant when downtown. Only regret is I had to work and couldn't have a drink. Very generous pours on screwdrivers and bloody Mary's!!"}
{"text":"*10 minutes from Phoenix airport  1. Park in the parking garage.  2. Go into the hotel through the big glass doors.  3. Walk back to the elevators and take them to the 2nd floor.  4. Exit the elevator and turn right. 5. Arrive at restaurant and wait to be seated.   They have the best french toast I have ever had in my life! They make it with challah bread which makes it so it isn't soggy, but still fluffy and sweet. Both types of French toast are great, if you choose the signature French toast you'll get real fresh berries, not the goop that people put in pies.   You can eat inside which is beautiful and very clean, or outside which is very nice, but the tables are up high, so I can imagine for those who are mobility handicapped it would be tough to sit outside. There is dedicated handicapped seating inside.   If you get orange juice, you'll get a good size glass instead of the tiny ones at most restaurants.   \"\"Be careful with the prices though! A frappuccino costs $6 :( (although it was delicious)"}
{"text":"Breakfast Club (BC) is something of a mystery to me.  What's the story behind it?  Whose inspiration brought this place to life?  Who are the minds behind the look, the feel, and the menu of this place?  I guess I'm one of those people that enjoys the romance of little things like that going into a dining experience.  Florida based RDG Development is the owner of this breakfast nook (with locations both in Downtown Phoenix and Old Town Scottsdale), but the trail abruptly ends there.  So I guess Breakfast Club just sprung out of thin air?  No matter.  Empty fridge on a Saturday morning and hungry, Breakfast Club's Downtown location is less than a mile walk for me.  Arriving at 7am opening, it was time to eat.  Oh, and yes Breakfast Club's Downtown location can indeed be a challenge to find.  So I'll make it as simple as possible.  Go to the second floor outdoor walkway of the Cityscape block east of Central, south of Washington, West of 1st St, and north of Jefferson.  Along the outdoor walkway in the middle, you'll find Breakfast Club nestled between Blue Hound Kitchen and Green Iron Cleaners.  You can park in one of the underground parking lots at Cityscape and the hostess at the restaurant will validate your parking.  Got it?  Alright, now to the dining experience.  I grabbed a spot at the bar area for my first breakfast outing.  The restaurant can seat more than 100 at capacity including more than a dozen at the front bar.  The menu at BC is fairly traditional but with a decent amount of variety.  You've got your meat and egg plates, your yogurt and cereal bowls, omelets, waffles, french toast, benedicts, pretty much exactly what you'd expect at a breakfast spot.  BC helpfully marks their specialty items with the BC namesake in case you're looking for items that stand out, so that's my M.O. for my first outing here.  I actually went with two items for my first visit.  First off, the BC Granola bowl.  Oats, dates, golden raisins, apricots, flax seed, dried cranberries, apple, and chia seeds served with your milk of choice (I went with almond milk).  For my second dish, the BC Signature French Toast.  Cinnamon Challah french toast topped with almonds, walnuts, and a variety of berries.  And of course a small glass of OJ to wash it all down.  First off, the granola.  I've had some great granola mixes at other breakfast spots (Pomegranate Cafe's especially stands out), but this one was a disappointment for me.  While undeniably healthy, the chia and flax seeds overwhelmed the other flavors going on in this dish.  I didn't pick up hardly any of the sweet or fruity components I was hoping for.  The texture was fine and the almond milk was an adequate accompaniment, but the granola itself just wasn't a very pleasant experience for my palate.  The french toast on the other hand was largely a thumbs up.  Great big portion with a generous helping of the fruit and nuts.  Toast was perfectly cooked and a good mix of the sweet and savory components.  Total cost for the food, OJ, tax, and tip came to $29.  The granola was a disappointment as I mentioned earlier, but french toast was solid.  As I write this, BC currently gets a 3.5 star Yelp rating.  I think that's pretty much dead on.  The friendly and attentive service I got from the wait staff (and my waitress in particular), combined with the large portions of food was enough to push this just enough into 4 star range.  The place was packed by Saturday at 8am so clearly BC has its fans.  I'd still love to know who the brainchild (or brainchildren) of this operation are and what direction its going in the future.  But for now, I'd say Cityscape has itself a reputable breakfast stop.  As long as that's the case, I suppose that's all that matters."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I ordered the Start Loaded with a slice of French toasts. My SO ordered the Start sandwhich. The fruit that came with my order was not fresh and a bit dry. My rye bread was hard, like it was over toasted. The eggs, potatoes and maple bacon were ok. The French toast didn't have a cinnamon flavor or any real flavor besides eggs and bread. The portion size was adequate and the staff werw professional, although we waited roughly 20-25 minutes fron seat tine to table plating for our food."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel Palomar and walked down to the Breakfast Club 2 days in a row. It was GREAT both days! We sat outside both days and enjoyed the great weather.   The service was prompt and can't really say anything negative about this spot.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried on the menu has been a hit!!! This was my third time coming back. Fresh tasting and priced great!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff but DO NOT come here in a party of 2 and expect the order and be out the door in less 45 minutes"}
{"text":"Here's the deal -- nothing wrecks a restaurant quicker for me than rude staff. My boyfriend and I walked in on a fairly dead Sunday around lunchtime and saw staff abound -- but no one greeted us, showed us to a table or even looked up. A few minutes later, the woman behind the bar shouted that we could sit wherever. Ten minutes later, and we still hadn't been visited by a server or gotten menus. We finally asked a busser if he could bring us some menus and he seemed put out. When a server did come over, she was neither the slightest bit apologetic or friendly. Something so simple as hiring friendly waitstaff can make or break a restaurant. If the food was stellar, we might return, but it was \"meh\" -- passable, but not anything I'm craving to go back for, which is unfortunate as the location is great."}
{"text":"Holy hard to find! It took us two days to locate this place. Thankfully after reading other Yelp reviews we found the Breakfast Club is located in the center of the complex on the 2nd floor. The first sign showing us where to go was in the parking garage elevator.  The patio was very comforting and casual. I ordered The Bird omelette. A massive amount of turkey and avocado. I don't each this much turkey on Thanksgiving. It was just too much. The side of fruit was very welcomed and the potatoes were just right.   My coworkers enjoyed their french toast and eggs benny, but both had over half their entrees left on their plate. Such a waste in food with huge portions."}
{"text":"First time at the Breakfast Club. Hard to find cuz it doesn't face the street. Park nearby and walk up the steps between Central, 1st St., Jefferson and Washington. Nice plaza plus seating inside. The furniture outside was pretty beat up tho.   Upscale breakfast with darkly dressed hostesses and servers. My server greeted me right away but sadly spent much of her time with the bigger tables.   I ordered a large juice and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese. It came with hash browns, two eggs, and bacon on a grilled cheese.   The sandwich was disappointing. It was boring. One slice of cheese, way too much under cooked hash browns and no seasoning. No fruit on the side. No garnish. Nothing. Just $7.50 for a boring sandwich and $7 for a glass of juice.   They are charging their customers for their location. Just because they dress everyone in black does not make it high end. I will be recommending my friends NOT to bother with this over priced, over valued, over dressed stop."}
{"text":"Border bowl is so delicious.  House hot sauce is definitely hot.  Service was great and wait was less than 5 mins.  If I'm ever in downtown for breakfast again, I'm eating here.  Like all of downtown, parking sucks, but they validate 2 hours for parking structure."}
{"text":"Great place to people watch outside. It is kinda hidden right behind the cityscape. The waitress we had was terrible. She lacked enthusiasm! When ordering she just really seemed uninterested. Our food, I got the breakfast sandwich. Over all good but fell apart a bit due to the cheese/hasbrowns. Over all experience was just okay, my first time here but I don't believe I'll be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from Washington State looking forward to eating at this establishment.  Our server Corinne was terrible. I did inform the manager about the poor service.  Unfortunately I feel like it was a waste of my time.  Scottsdale I hear has great service so don't waste your time at this location.   Seattle Best  JQ"}
{"text":"Absolute best French toast on the  planet and the mimosa is off the chain. This location is located in an upscale hotel/apartment Bldg connected to a mall. So yes it's trendy and pricy  the service is unmatched. Food preparation, presentation and quality are first class. I definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Very good food and worth every penny spent. The food came out quick and left me in a food coma. Would have given this place 5 stars however I didn't feel that the service at this location was all that great."}
{"text":"I ate here twice during Comicon, and both experiences were very positive. They were insanely busy and so service was understandably a bit delayed. The 4 stars is due to high drink pricing and attention to detail (dirty tabletop, no steak knife provided with a steak dish).   I tried the filet mignon benedict, and it was worth every penny. Great flavor, perfectly medium rare. The hollandaise came out less saucy and more like mayonnaise- that is a preference issue I suppose. There is a varried menu, I also tried the bacon breakfast sandwich which was top notch. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This breakfast was good and the views of Downtown was unique And Fun!!! I had the BLT and my fianc√© had Biscuit and Gravy both really good.  Service was great too!! Must try! Happy Eats!!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to try something new since my boyfriend and I were staying on this side of town . Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly hostess up front and was able to be seated at that moment , there after service just went down hill . Our server came to grab our drink order and we let her know it was our first time and she really didn't seem to care very much to make any suggestions or small talk . With the small menu , it wasn't difficult choosing what to order . I started off with an orange juice and until I took the first sip i didn't notice it was fresh squeezed , it was amazing , I ordered the turkey club wrap with a side salad and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast grilled cheese sand which without the Fontaine . Food came out in an acceptable amount of time , but a different server brought out food out , from what i learned from being a server my self , if someone takes your food out , you check up on them right after to see if everything came out right , regardless what the food runner has to say, didn't see our server for another 10 - 15 mins or so , my boyfriends drink was empty , he wanted Tabasco and I needed mustard , took a few bites out of my wrap since I was waiting for the Tabasco and mustard and it was just as good without it but I just love mustard . Anyways our sever finally comes around and drops the check off , and I looked at my boyfriend who still had half his grilled cheese and me still having more than half a wrap , and I just couldn't believe it , i was no where close to being done with my food and we weren't even there for more than 30 mins , my boyfriend finished where I just asked for a Togo container . Price was just right , food was on point , but our server , just took two stars off this review for me ."}
{"text":"Always great service with great breakfast selections.  Just had the breakfast bowl which was packed with flavor and very meaty.  Great location with easy parking on 1st just south of jefferson in the parking meter stalls is probably the easiest to get here.  Food is reasonably priced and the coffee is always fresh"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast on a very busy Sunday . Hannah promptly greeted us. She was exuberant and lively and gave wonderful recommendation. She took time to converse with us and made it a wonderful experience! We will be back"}
{"text":"Border bowl was delicious, very meaty and great spice & heat. I swapped scrambled eggs for poached eggs just because I love poached eggs, I'm sure scrambled would taste great. Service was good, cool environment. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited about the uprising of local restaurants downtown that I decided to try out the newest addition.  I went with 3 other people, and none of us will ever be back!  As HORRIBLE as the food was, I have never received such horendous customer service!  Our server was Kendyl.  She not only has no idea what is served in her establishment, she has no idea what customer service truly is.  At one point, she apologized for her attitude by telling us that she was tired because she works two jobs and she didn't get enough sleep the night before.  Not only is that not my fault, it shouldn't be my problem.  Our greeting took forever, our ordering was drawn out due to her back-and-forth to the kitchen to ask questions, our drinks were wrong (3 times), our food was wrong and missing items, and then our check took forever because she had to get an item removed.  We were one of only three tables in this restaurant on a Saturday morning.  There were numerous servers, baristas/bartenders, and even a manager, not only roaming around the restaurant but leaning on the host stand with nothing to do.  Is it that hard for the manager (who stood out like a sore thumb) to do a table touch with the three tables in his establishment?!?!?!  Not only will I never visit this restaurant again, but I will try to disuade everyone I can from going.  If I could rate lower than one star I would!"}
{"text":"Nice landscape and great variety of freshly squeezed juices (orange, pineapple, grapefruit, etc.). Large portions with heavier food options. Not the place to be for a light start to the day, but a decent start if you have some hiking or outdoor adventures planned."}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix from San Francisco and chose most of the places for food based on Yelp...and this time, Yelp disappointed. Kinda bummed we wasted a meal on BC.   While the outdoor area was nice and quiet and the staff was really friendly on a nice Sunday morning, the food was below par.   We ordered the lox bagel - which was fine, because they made none of it in-house - and the vegetable omelette. The egg white vegetable omelette was something you would expect from a college dining hall - made from egg beaters. Such a disappointment.   Perhaps the other offerings are much better, but my first and last impression of BC is of cheap egg beaters."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high because of the great reviews on Yelp! Facebook and from the front desk of my hotel but - while the food was definitely tasty - I don't think it was great.  The service was just kinda meh, and good flavors of the food were diminished by the fact that nothing was hot.   So the menu is creative, with some of your expected breakfast favorites and a nice selection of in-house specialties. I had the biscuits and gravy - which uses a jalape√±o cheddar biscuit (yum) with sausage gravy, two eggs on top (the only thing in my whole meal that required salt & pepper ) which were cooked perfectly over medium, and potatoes O'Brien, plus a sausage patty that I added for good measure.   I appreciate that they're making everything fresh - this was not a frozen biscuit, the potatoes were fresh baby reds with red & green bell peppers and onions. The sausage patty was even handmade (can't swear to it being house-made sausage, but it was definitely formed by hand not the usual perfect circle).  The food all had a really flavor - but the problem was that it was all lukewarm.  The sausage gravy was congealing on the plate - no steam even as I cut through it and into the biscuit. The sausage patty was over cooked and dry - but had a nice flavor profile. I'll bet if it was a little less cooked and served straight off the grill it would be ah-mazing.   This is a personal pet peeve - but if I order and iced tea I expect iced tea. If you brew fruit infused tea, tell me. Don't let me taste it unknowingly and have that nasty taste in my mouth.  Service aside from that was polite, but again nothing to write home about. No one asked if my food was good until I was halfway done.  So, no bonus points for service.  I saw several other plates of food that all looked fantastic - and since it's a nice place and not chain food I'll probably try it again while I'm here this weekend."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast last Sunday.  Trying to hit up some local downtown places.  We sat outside and I ordered an iced coffe.  The coffee was good, not bitter which was a nice surprise.  We both ordered The Bird Omelette, with no cheese and asked for a side of pico.  So our food comes out and there is no pico. Someone forgot to make it... ummm ok.  The replacement was pace picante salsa... which IMO is not salsa and should not be served at restaurants.  The omelette was just ok.  It literally was huge... like 4 egg and over cooked.  The eggs were rubery and the turkey was dry, I thought it was a cracker no joke.  After a few minutes our server brings out a side of pico which helped tremendously.  It was very fresh and nice flavor.  We get the check and I am ready to pay when I see that they charged me for the pico?!?! Umm... excuse me but I just ordered two omelettes with no cheese... I think that would have given me a pass on the charge for the pico.. which I think was $2 it was good but not that good.  I hate places that nickle and dime you to death... so unfortunately even though we can walk there from our condo we wont be back.   The two stars are for the atmosphere, the coffee and the potatoes.  Another disappointing downtown eatery :/"}
{"text":"Every other week or so- I pick up breakfast for me and sometimes for the coworks as well.   So far I have tried the Tuscan, the Wild Mushroom and the Bird omelets. These all taste great and range from $9 - $11. The size of the omelet is so big, it's a no brainer to share. Or in my case, make two to three breakfasts out of it. With a side of pork candy(bacon), my meal is replete.  The BC Signature French Toast is lightly griddled and crisp-delicious. I love the challah bread base and the fresh fruit on top. Again, full order is a lot of food. You can order the French toast regular and their sweet cream pancakes per slice/per cake. Let me tell you- Their French toast reheated in the workplace toaster oven is awesome. Double points for using real maple syrup!  I look forward to trying their Benedicts and Southwest bowls.  If you order for take out, they'll give you a range of when you can expect to pick up the order. Usually ready in 10 mins.  The reason for four stars is there is no 4.5 stars. Sometimes in the coffee kiosk, where you pick up your order, it will sit while they ring up the customers grabbing a coffee. I hate my food getting cold. And you can tell those of us who are standing there waiting to be acknowledged to get take out orders.  So if that gets better organized, I will bump up my rating."}
{"text":"Convenient location with a decent breakfast.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed my strawberry french toast, but there was nothing exceptional about my visit.  Staff was 1/2 friendly and the other 1/2 not so much.  Atmosphere is nice, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Went here once and haven't gone back. Ordered the breakfast sandwich with no bacon because i'm a vegetarian. Sandwich came out with bacon. No big deal, i'm flexible and every restaurants makes mistakes. Ask them for a new sandwich. Waitress says \"do you want a fresh one or do you want me to just take the bacon off?\"  Asked to be remade since I don't eat meat and the bacon and already been smothered in between the eggs and cheese. Comes back rather quickly with a \"new\" sandwich so I say \"this is a brand new sandwich, that was quick?\" She said yes and I start to eat it only to find bits of bacon still stuck in the egg and cheese. I was not upset that the sandwich was incorrect in the first place, but the fact that the waitress just picked off the bacon and then lied to me was outrageous. If I was wanted it being picked off I would have used my own hands! Further, when I showed her the sandwich she did not even apologize. I will say that right before we were leaving a manager did come out and apologize and provided me a gift card to try their place again, though I don't think it will get used by me as I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"You know what rhymes with weekend ? Breakfast!! Okay maybe not. But let me be blonde and have this one. For me.. breakfast and weekends at home go together like pancakes and syrup and champagne and Oj! I was so happy to see another location of Breakfast Club come to the valley! This location is downtown; has a great patio and you can walk up to the bar and get started with morning libations or the hair of the dog drinks while you wait for your table. I highly recommend the Bloody Mary! The menu has a variety of unique breakfast items like Omelets, Benes and several southwest dishes too, just to pay homage to our great area. All made with fresh ingredients! There are the usual waffle and pancake items too... on this particular weekend day, we sat outside under one of the large umbrellas and I had a Breakfast Grilled Cheese and a Cappuccino... just to top off that amazing Bloody Mary I had ! The BCC is a sourdough sandwich layered with hash browns; eggs; bacon; two( !!!! ) cheeses--- Fontina and cheddar and toasted perfectly! My husband and I had such a great time on this patio and the service was so friendly ..we had another drink .. this time a Mimosa and spent another hour up here.. I highly recommend this place for breakfast, brunch or any Fun Day!"}
{"text":"I've loved everything I've tried for breakfast. My personal favorite is the BC Burro, which is the perfect size and price for a quick breakfast. But if you're in the mood for something bigger, the Border Bowl with a bunch of meats, veggies, potatoes, and cheese is ridiculously good.  There are several benedicts on the menu, absolutely fantastic. The potatoes o'brien and fruit make an outstanding side.  Plus you can't go wrong with a mimosa first thing in the morning.  The people are friendly, location is great, and there's plenty of outdoor seating for when the weather is beautiful like it is right now."}
{"text":"Beware, seems like a popular place so make reservations if you can, especially on the weekends.  Food is pretty good, pretty unique combos. Wait staff is pretty accommodating, there were some that seemed to be in a hurry to take food & drink orders, but that being said the joint was packed. It has a kiosk where you can get little sandwiches & drinks. Something my boyfriend & I found interesting is  you can get a side of filet minon! Overall, nice place to get breakfast or brunch, but can be pretty loud or packed, so if you're looking for a more quiet place to have a nice breakfast perhaps look elsewhere. That being said, I do recommend this place if for nothing else the french toast!"}
{"text":"Came here as a breakfast stop after being picked up from the airport with friends. Let me just say, the area nice, and our waiter was friendly and helpful discussing the items in the menu. Well, I decided to try the strawberry salad and have a side of French toast. First off, the salad was amazing! Even though it was drenched in the salad dressing. I would ask for the dressing in the side. The French toast, yum! Not eggy and definitely enough sweet. I also tried my friend's meals. The blue corn packages were rich and different. A good kind of different but it is a heavy food in general but made well."}
{"text":"Food great.  Cornbread could've been a little sweeter. Biggest compliant service was quite bad.  Took a long time to get food and server was lacking friendliness."}
{"text":"Ok, I can say so far I am not impressed. They have 1 server, if that, for a full bar. She is spread so thin she cannot effectively handle all of the people. There is no excuse for this, it is a Saturday. They know they are going to be busy. (actually server says they are not short staffed just they have too many customers!! Really?!) They should double if not triple their staff. Poor management is all I can say. I have ordered the BC Dip. It is 1:20 right now. I will update the review when it comes out. We are at 1:45 now and still no food. This should have been an easy 10 minute dish. Not very busy now. Service and attention still not at par. Reducing from 3 to 2 stars for lack of effort. I 1:53 and still no food. Going to 1 star. She has offered to box it for me when it comes it. Really? Come on."}
{"text":"My party of 12 called ahead to get our table reserved. They said it would be ready in 15 minutes. We received a notification via text that our table was ready as we parked. We went to the hostess stand to be greeted by a less than friendly hostess that said it would be 20 minutes. We asked what happened and received no apology nor sincere attempt to accommodate our party. Our large party went elsewhere, their loss! The good news is there are plenty of places within waking distance to compete with below par service of this establishment."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty food! I ordered the Tinga Chicken Frittata and a Blue Corn Pancake on the side. The wrong pancake was brought out so they let us keep that in addition to the correct one which is always a sign of a great wait staff!       The meat in my dish was delicious, the eggs & potatoes were a little on the plain side, but I did order it without the tortilla strips and with less cheese so that could be on me."}
{"text":"So so fresh squeezed juice. Food is above average. They actually give you way too much food. Service is fantastic! Been here three times in three years, in the area type stops. So if you are.... In the area, stop in."}
{"text":"Stopped in while in town for a conference.  There's a great outdoor dining spot with plenty of shade; there's even an area for dogs too.  There's also plenty of indoor seating as well.    We ordered the breakfast grilled cheese sandwich, biscuits and gravy, a pancake, coffee, and Bloody Mary.  The grilled cheese sandwich was excellent, with folded scrambled eggs, crispy shredded hash browns, and melts cheese (I opted for the bacon on the side; the bacon was delicious and perfectly cooked). The biscuits and gravy was delicious with the jalape√±o cheese biscuits.  The pancake was super tasty and fluffy.  The Blood Mary was tangy with a lemon pepper overtone.  The service was very friendly and attentive. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for a friend at a nearby hotel. Friendly ladies behind the \"bar\" here.....suggested the pulled pork. Great flavor. I have been to their sister location in Scottsdale for Breakfast. Not a bad way to cure a hangover."}
{"text":"Great bfast! Traditional eggs Benedict was delicious! The sea salt caramel French Toast was excellent! And biscuit n gravy was really good. Staff was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This was a great little breakfast place.  Cool, colorful and clean on the inside. The service was fast and appropriately attentive.  The food was delicious.  The menu is super varied, so there is something for everyone.  The coffee drinks were delicious and the experience was wholly satisfying.  A great place to start your day!"}
{"text":"What I Ate - Quick Start Loaded (4 eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast, and fruit) - glass of milk  Would I Go Again? I really enjoyed my breakfast here, and I will probably go back in a few days.  The eggs were very good (two fried, two scrambled), the whole wheat toast had a great flavor with just the right amount of butter, and the fruit was fresh.  However, the highlight of the meal for me was the homestyle potatoes.  The edges were crisp, and they were cooked with red and green peppers which gave the potatoes a great flavor.  The only disappointment was the bacon, which I would classify as below-average bacon.  Maybe the chef had an off day.  The rest of the breakfast was so enjoyable that I am willing to give the chef a mulligan on the bacon.  Additionally, their outdoor seating was the perfect place to enjoy breakfast outside in Phoenix's beautiful November weather!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this breakfast spot and we absolutely love it. Their food is delicious and has been every time we have been there. The only thing that seems to change from visit to visit is the service and the coffee. Some days the service and coffee are great and other days it is not. Honestly though, the food definitely makes up for it. Also, we have not tried their espresso coffees, only the drip coffees. So far we are stuck on two dishes because they are amazing: the biscuits and gravy and the border bowl. We highly recommend both of them, everything on the menu looks great though. The service has mostly been good. We are always seated right away and the staff are always friendly. Usually your water and coffee stays pretty full because everyone seems to help out with replenishing most days. This is a great spot for breakfast or brunch! They have indoor or outdoor seating and the atmosphere is very relaxing and nice. It is a little expensive, but that is the norm for everywhere downtown."}
{"text":"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat."}
{"text":"Great experience. Friendly staff. Food was delicious. Loved my grapefruit juice. Complimentary water bottles to go!"}
{"text":"This is a usual spot for my friends and I to eat on Sunday mornings when we can. I typically order the quick start loaded which is eggs, bacon, potatoes etc... They do have amazing jam that comes with your toast and I am a fan of the raspberry! The food is very fresh and looks amazing. This place gets pretty busy, and in the summer months there is definitely a wait because nobody wants to sit outside. One of my favorite places to nurse a hangover. Yummmmmmmmmy."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff. Fresh squeezed OJ  I ordered the breakfast grilled cheese.  It was delish"}
{"text":"Great place!  I was here for work and it was next door to my hotel.  It was high quality diner food with some fancy twists.  The sausage and eggs were good and the French toast was outstanding.  I will return any time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I would definitely recommend... They told us there was a wait and not even 3 minutes later we were seated. Everything was so fresh, especially the juice! Favorite breakfast place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cute edgy down town breakfast place! I love going here, it's a Sunday go to. I love their Mexican border bowl and their pancakes! They also have HUGE idc coffees that make waking up a lot easier. I would suggest coming here and giving it a try! Good for families and friends!"}
{"text":"Great food. Service was good. Usually crowded in the weekend. Best suggestion.....no wait app!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It was a little too hot to sit on the patio but we did anyways. We ordered the Bird Omelette and Berry Salad! Perfect combination. I'll def be back for both. Summer is coming along so might want to put in the mist machines if your going to have people outside. Loved the location!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good! There is typically a small wait, ours was maybe 10 minutes, but trust me, it'll be worth it.  The place isn't large on the inside so it does feel a bit cramped.  There are lots of outdoor seating but isn't popular during winter so everyone want to be inside. Service is great! My coffee cup was never empty. Smiley welcoming faces.   Food is good, I had the border bowl, which was amazing! Prices are fair for the location. Would probably be back when back in town. Food 4/5 Price 3/5 Service 5/5 Place 4/5"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to an event downtown. The staff was courteous and kept their cool amongst the craziness that was going on. The menu was awesome and my food was so tasty! Very fresh too! Plus, the cost was pretty reasonable for the amount of food you're getting. I will be back for sure. {If you like corn bread- I recommend the Huevos con Mesa!}"}
{"text":"Breakfast club was good restaurant. I would of give it 4 stars but it's really pricey for what you get. Come on it's only breakfast. 4 dollars for orange juice is pretty high if you asks me. If you have about 15 to 20 dollars per person to spend on only breakfast go ahead."}
{"text":"This place was super-good. I had \"The Bird\" omelette and it was great. My buddies had the breakfast grilled cheese and the \"Lean and Green\" omelette. All were great. Our server \"Wynsome\" was friendly and willing to make separate checks for our entire party (thanks!!)."}
{"text":"Was looking at a list of breakfast places nearby the hotel I was staying at and was delighted to see that the Breakfast Club was within walking distance. I've been here before about 3-4 years ago but it was just as good then as it was yesterday.  It's a very laid back type of place with indoor/outdoor seating. I chose indoors because I didn't want to get hot and sweaty. You seat yourself so my friend and I chose a booth seat.  Service was fast! We ordered drinks ($7 mimosas for their breakfast cocktails) and they came out fast! I ordered The Bird omelette which came with potatoes and fruit. I was expecting the potatoes to need a ton of salt and the fruit to be bland. That was not the case. The potatoes had such a delicious flavor and the fruit was freshly cut. The omelette was better than I expected. Most omelets barely have any of the fixings, this omelet was packed with chunks of avocado and turkey and everything it came with.  Friendly staff, amazing food, and laid back scenery, the Breakfast Club is a great way to start the morning"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious filling food.  I highly recommend this place and I'll be coming again when I'm in town"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here. I'm in love with their sweet cream pancakes. Out of this world.  This place is also the only place I can find with a dish that gives you 4 eggs as part of the dish; no need to order two more on the side. Food is fresh and very tasty. I will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here twice during my recent trip to AZ. It was solid. They have indoor and outdoor seating and service was good. We had ice tea to drink and they were refilled without having to ask.  We ordered..  Lean & Green Omelette- Egg whites, spinach, mushroom, broccoli, onion, bell peppers & Swiss cheese Whole Hog Omelette- Ham, bacon, sausage, chorizo and cheddar cheese drizzled with cr√®me fraiche Quick Start- Conscious 4 egg whites, broccoli, cottage cheese, tomatoes & fresh fruit The Bird Omelette-Turkey, avocado, mushrooms, boursin & topped with cr√®me fraiche  All were tasty, with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing food, attentive service, and beautiful views! The perfect place to come for breakfast when downtown"}
{"text":"A little hard to find (on the second floor on the East Fitness side), but the staff and the vibe are great.  Come here if you like decadent pancake options such as bananas foster toppings.  However, if you are looking for traditional breakfast plates stick to the diners that you are used to (I came here because I couldn't find a Cracker Barrel near by) as their standard breakfast items are good, but are not vastly different or tastier than your normal diner (ex buck wheat pancakes here vs grain pancakes at IHOP).  Best for people wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"If you want a good breakfast experience, this is a great place to go. It is in the middle of the city and the open atmosphere gives you the vibe that you're not necessarily in the middle of the desert. The portions are nicely sized so you know the value of your dollar will be appreciated at this place. The staff is quite friendly and helpful when trying to decide on either a beverage or your meal. It also was kind of cool that when I was there, a celebrity was present. There was this calm about everyone there that you do not normally find. Usually the staff ignores other customers due to the over service of said celebrity. Also, the people that eat here have tact...it was a decent time... and of course if you have good company to chat with over a delicious breakfast it cannot get much better, can it? :)"}
{"text":"This place was great. I got an omelette, and it was cooked to puffy perfection. The hash browns were delicious, and the Bloody Mary spicy and divine.  Sometimes just getting it right does it for me too. I asked to substitute hash browns for the usual potatoes, which sounds like a simple request but is usually ignored more than accomplished, and not only did they follow through on my request... they still gave me a few potatoes so I could taste what I had been missing out on.  Would recommend again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast (eggs, bacon, French Toast and waffle And Loved the Hot Green Tea  Excellent Service as well. I will go back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit to Breakfast Club. The Quick Start (two eggs, bacon, fruit, toast) was very tasty and reasonably priced. It's got a cool vibe, the servers are friendly and the wait wasn't too long once my order was placed. I would definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"On my my recent trip to downtown Phoenix for business, I stayed at the Kimpton Palomar. Breakfast Club- CityScape was recommended by a few of the hotel staff members so my co-workers and I made this our \"go-to\" place for breakfast being that they are located right outside of the hotel.   After doing plenty research after the recommendations I was pretty sold on the fact that they are going to deliver on the food! I was most excited with the many positive reviews and anticipated that our experience as a group would be the same. Unfortunately that didn't happen at all. The breakfast club dropped the ball heavily on not one but two of our visits for breakfast.   On our first breakfast experience we checked in with the hostess and started out with a not so friendly greeting but that was overlooked. For starters things just started off really tough.  We had issues that day and the previous with the food as well as the espressos coming out cold. Lipstick prints from previous customers on the coffee cups. When bringing these issues up to our server it was automatically an issue instead of creating a solution. This place has just so much unnecessary attitude from a lot of the girls that work here it's not even funny.  Alyssa who was our server the first day right from the beginning was pretty nasty. She wasn't friendly at all and had a very unwelcoming demeanor. My co-worker got a receipt snatched out of her hand from Alyssa, some eye rolling, blowing out hot air you name it. She was AWFUL!   On the second day we again arrived at the hostess station to check in thinking that we would like to give them the benefit of doubt about what happened the previous day.  We requested that we didn't receive the server Alyssa again and the hostess thought it was funny. Assuming that was communicated to the new server she also came over with an unnecessary attitude.   After being fed up with this type of behavior finally one of my coworkers requested the manager who came over pretty much in awe of what we had experienced. It was our lucky day because the operations/district manager was available he too couldn't believe what kind of service we had been receiving.   I'm sure by now you're wondering well damn what about the food? The food was decent and to be quiet honest when you have service as terrible as what we experienced the food didn't even matter at that point. I did hear one of my co workers compliment the French toast sticks so that we can say it's safe to order. My salmon egg Benedict was pretty decent as well. Skip the apple juice as it's some sort of organic flavor that they fail to explain prior to ordering with the assumption that everybody will just like the taste. Being that I don't visit Phoenix often I can't say that I'd even care to visit them again.."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful, service was attentive, quick and friendly. Great breakfast bowl and terrific coffee. Go there now!"}
{"text":"Great meal - great service - great coffee - very busy place - fresh squeezed OJ & Lemonade!!!! Would totally come back! I ask for a special plate and they responded - no problem - did I mention great service & great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for breakfast. Always great food.  Love the burrito with queso. Great service and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place downtown!the turkey bene egg Benedict is so special! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Illinois we enjoyed a great breakfast on our first morning in Phoenix. The boys (son & hubby) had the pancakes-light, fluffy and delicious. The girls had the Bird omelet-stuffed with mushrooms, avocado, turkey and Boursin cheese. Delicious! The avocados were perfectly ripe, something Chicago chefs need to learn. Good coffee-not too bitter and they are very generous with the half & half-gave us a pint at least! Great service from Natalie and food came out in less than 10 minutes! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always good.  Some of my faves..fresh squeezed oj [even better as a mimosa) bloody Mary's, eggs Benedict, potatoes obrien, French toast. Yum. Yum. One of the best breakfasts in the valley. Go on a weekday if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Came here for lunch with my work team and really enjoyed it. Very good food and quick, efficient service for our working lunch."}
{"text":"Had a client in from out of town and took them here for lunch yesterday. The hostesses were very friendly but our server and the food left something to be desired.  I ordered the veggie wrap which the menu boasted to be filled with a variety of veggies.  There was half a mushroom and the rest was warm soggy spinach. It was terrible! I actually opened the wrap to see if there was anything else inside and found nothing other than that one sliver of mushroom and a sliver of sun dried tomato. Whoever rolled the wrap must have done so wrong because after pushing plate to the side and just asking for a small Caesar salad I dumped out the other half of wrap and it was filled with nothing but mushrooms. The server just dismissed it when I mentioned my displeasure with the wrap and didn't even offer an apology. Breakfast sitting at the bar area has always been great and I guess I will just have to stick with that. Never bringing a client back here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Sat out on the patio. Great service. Had steak and eggs which were amazing. The server brought us coffees  to go without us even asking. Huge portions. Not cheap($20 ea. before tip, for coffee and food) but totally worth it  in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito this afternoon right before my flight back to atlanta. It was good, unfortunately I couldn't finish cause it's big. Service was great tho. Fruit was fresh. No complaints."}
{"text":"And score one more for a great breakfast experience.  Got in at around 1105 and was seated and eating by 1120 and the place was packed.  Service was great and the staff was accommodating with any special request/ridiculous questions. (Tony was our server and he was great, running around like crazy and he still managed to constantly check in).   It was a nice morning so we chose to sit outside on the patio which I very much recommend. (Amazing people watching as it's in a business park type area). To eat I had a mushroom, spinach, ham, and cheese omelette with pepper jack and cheddar cheese. The omelette was great. Not one bad thing to say and this was only 11 dollars and it came with potato's, and fresh fruit. Everything was on point the potatoes came with yellow and red peppers which gave off a nice spice-kick.  The high light of the morning  was the potatoes. I don't know how they did it but it was perfectly crisp with spice. It's rare that the side is better than the main dish. All hail the mighty potato. Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I would possibly give this one a 2.5 stars if it were possible but the two stars is not wholly inaccurate. As others have stated, portions are huge and the food is generally quite tasty. What is lacking is service. On my visit I ordered coffee and was at first very happy when I received the huge pitcher of cream instead of one of those cute but unreasonably small things that holds two tablespoons but that is where my delight ended. Upon finishing my cup,before food arrived, I was completely done with my meal before being asked if I would like a refill. And there were plenty of opportunities, as one member of my party had been given an incorrect order that needed to be replaced, so there were at least six people/stops at the table where they could clearly observe an empty cup. Empty water cups also went unfilled until we flagged someone down.  That incorrect order was also a fail. My sister doesn't eat meat so she requested the breakfast burrito, sans chorizo. Instead she was served one with chorizo and the extra chorizo queso on the side. It took just over 20 minutes to get a replacement breakfast burrito, which at this point is basically scrambled eggs and mushrooms. When the check came, we were charged an extra amount for the chorizo queso, which we had to request be removed from the bill as we pointed out it was never requested in the first place.  No one ever came to ask if the food that was delivered properly was satisfactory and one of my dining companions got up and grabbed a condiment carrier for our table as it was clear that unless we got one on our own it wasn't going to happen.  Overall the food is good when you actually get what you order, but when I choose to go out to eat, especially for breakfast, it is about service as much as food. If I wanted to serve myself and not have anyone be concerned about my experience I would still be in a bad marriage. It is so disappointing because this area of the city is bereft of morning options, but sadly bad service doesn't change things."}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing! My girlfriend and I went here for breakfast this morning and we couldn't even finish our plates!!!"}
{"text":"I love sitting on their outdoor patio when the weather is nice.  I used to work around here, and it was a nice escape from the office.  This place is in the heart of downtown Phx.  You're surrounded by all the skyscrapers.  Breakfast Club is pretty casual, and great for meeting friends, or business colleagues.  The breakfast is pretty good, and the service is quick!  I would recommend any of their omelet's!"}
{"text":"Ate here about a month ago for breakfast....delicious!  The decor of the place is very nice and modern...simple and clean.  The food was amazing.  I don't even know what my boyfriend ate, I was too in love with the breakfast grilled cheese.  Which was so good I tried to make one at home the next morning and failed miserably.  Can't wait to take my parents here when they come to town!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is of course the star.  I generally don't bother with their lunch menu.  Be warned though, there is nothing healthy on the breakfast menu (except maybe the oatmeal).  The eggs benedict is done well and it comes with a mountain of potatoes.  The pancakes look more like dessert than your first meal of the day.  One gripe?  No diet coke!"}
{"text":"Good service and coffee. I had the white and green omelet and a side of delish French toast. My friend had eggs benedict and she loved it. They have fresh squeezed juices - I had grapefruit which was also really good. Would definitely return again and again and explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Service too long , food ok. The girl at the kiosk was very rude,  not going back again"}
{"text":"A great stop if you're in the area! The restaurant is in a good location, being located in the cityscape center. The menu was large, it was hard to decide what to get! The prices are very fair for the amount of food you get. I ordered the chicken frittata and was 100% satisfied. Honestly the guacamole tasted very fresh and as if it was made just for my plate. Quiet place as well, all in all a very relaxing spot!"}
{"text":"Would not return to this restaurant again. We went in during a weekday morning when it was not overly busy. Service was painfully slow. Took over 15 minutes to get someone to our table to even ask for a drink order. We ordered iced tea which comes in a to-go cup with no refills even though we were dining in? I got the french toast and my boyfriend got the pancakes. They were both average at best and bland. The waiter didn't check up on us other than to take our syrup in the middle of eating for another table. Service took so long we ended up having to pay $8 for parking at the parking garage. Restaurant also seemed a bit dirty and in need of a cleaning."}
{"text":"Third time here ... even thought my previous visits were amazing today's was not a good experience, breakfast bowl took some time to arrive, by the time it was delivered it was cold and not edible, cold eggs are not a treat to be desire, not sure what issues may have been but it was a Monday not a very busy day, I decided to ask for a side of white bread toast ( something warm) why did I asked it took an additional 20 min  My previous two visits were amazing could of been an isolated incident, who knows"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Bestfriend of my brother (bro in hospital)and I decided to get breakfast and chose Breakfast Club.  It was good.  Very good. Eggs fluffy,  pancakes sweet, and hashbrowns crispy. We loved it.  It was a long wait though.  So call ahead to get on line.  We did."}
{"text":"Great location and portions are huge... My husband and I were visiting from Indianapolis and needed a big breakfast  nice atmosphere and great customer service."}
{"text":"I'm starting to appreciate the concept of a little more of an upscale breakfast. LONG gone are my undergrad days at NAU when we'd stumble into Mike and Rhonda's at 6am (because we'd been up drinking all night) and couldn't give two shits that the chicken was grossly under-cooked and still partly frozen.  So now I'm a grown-up(ish) and popped in here for brekkie the other day. To clarify, when I say \"upscale breakfast\" that means a TINY 4 oz breakfast fillet, two eggs (I appreciate that they asked if I wanted them poached soft, medium or hard-this made the difference between 3 and 4 stars-WELL DONE (not my steak or eggs!!!)) LOTS of hashbrowns which I ordered as a side, two pieces of toast and some fruit which was all artfully arranged.  Their fresh squeezed OJ was the highlight of the breakfast. Everything else was good, not stellar. If you're looking for value for money, look elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, I left feeling full but some folks may feel cheated when they get the bill, relative to what they got.   I personally liked the service, the bright cheery atmosphere and that I left feeling full but not stuffed. Another bonus that they gave me a refill on my coffee to go. I keep forgetting that these guys are just a few blocks from my work. This is the kind of place  that I would remember if I were visiting Phoenix from out of town."}
{"text":"Cool location.  The food was good.  I ordered a pancake and a waffle to try them put.  The waffle was good but The pancake was fantastic.  Oh and the side sausage patty was great.  The waitress was good.  The hostess was good.  This place will happen for me again.  Love down town.  Very good."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast place right in downtown Phoenix. Very good menu with cheap prices. Good portions. Had the chicken caesar wrap which was excellent; the side tomato soup was okay."}
{"text":"GREAT front outdoor sidewalk seating in the shade. I showed up at 2pm and service was good, prompt, and friendly. I ordered the $10 whole wheat pancakes which were pretty good, very wheaty w real maple syrup, but nothing to rave about. Good luck trying to find anything VEGAN on the menu except toast and fruit.  The girl at the table next to me ordered a massive burrito which looked like someone had barfed Mexican food on it- that's all I could think about. It was a creamy green color with corn in it and some red chunks. It didn't look appetizing at all, but she was moaning when she ate it, so I guess it was good. Different strokes!  Great place if you like to wear sweaters around your neck like they do in France kind of crowd. I probably won't go back unless someone else buys the ticket."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating at The Breakfast Club. I live in Peoria and do not mind the 35 minute drive. Both visits were enjoyable. The out door patio where I chose to dine at both visits is very comfortable and situated between two high rises. You may have to search for the restaurant due to it being located on the second floor next to the Tilted Kilt.  The service is fast and the food is very good. Today I had the bananas foster waffle which had great flavor. The waffle took up the entire plate and all the ingredients where fresh. My other two guests had biscuits and gravy and they loved it.  I would recommend The Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"Great breakfast we had this morning. It was recommended to us and the meal and service was excellent. Unfortunately we found this gem late in out trip and won't be able to return tomorrow to try another menu item. We look forward to returning next time we're in town."}
{"text":"After a long night of drinking, extended drinking and the rising sun..it was suddenly morning. Decided to grab a bite to eat and this place was convenient and decent.   I had the huevos rancheros with a bloody mary. It was good but nothing special. Service was decent and the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Great service and quick seating! The food was amazing and so was the coffee, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had New Year's Day brunch here. It was crazy busy. I had the chocolate peanut butter protein shake while we waited it was pretty bomb. Ordered the lox and bagel for my meal, I enjoyed it but they were out of the \"everything\" bagel. #sadface. I took off a star because i tasted the French toast and it was bland with no flavor."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill while my daughter was at baseball camp so I decided to grab a late breakfast. They don't have a dedicated gluten free menu but the waitress was able to give me some guidance.  I ordered the Tuscan omelette which had tomatoes, mozzarella, and pesto. I couldn't eat the potatoes, they are not gluten free, I had bacon as my side. The omelette was ok. I love pesto but the pesto on the omelette was not my favorite. The bacon was great. It was better than the omelette. It was thick cut. The service was fantastic.   Overall I would recommend eating here. I will go back and will try a different omelette."}
{"text":"Great menu selection, location, service & quality of food. I enjoyed the house French toast, perfectly poached eggs & freshly squeezed orange juice. Service was prompt & friendly. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Such a cool location with excellent food and friendly service. Can't be beat in my book"}
{"text":"They do not have fountain soda here - so if you like your morning caffeine \"cold & bubbly\" like I do - keep going.  They offer \"izzy sodas\" at $2.5 per bottle.. But that's not what I was looking for to wake me up this morning.    The food was good, hot & served quickly.  The service was OK.  The waitress definitely was happy for us to leave so she could flip the table."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. I'll definitely be going back. We were helped immediately and it didn't take long to get our food; always a plus when you're hungry!"}
{"text":"I often choose this as my breakfast go-to because Matt's is really busy and has a limited menu. This place has good drinks, lots of options, and a cool location with validated parking.  My issues here are mostly service-based. Once I ordered a screw driver and the waiter exclaimed \"Wow, it's a bit early...\" Um... do you even want a tip?? Also, it's one of those places where they often forget about you, especially toward the end of service, and then when they bring the bill they're all apologetic. But it always happens. Not the end of the world but almost always an issue.  Apart from that, I usually share the french toast and the breakfast grilled cheese with my husband. Both very good, but not unbelievably so. A solid choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"I loved this place especially because it's in the center for downtown Phoenix... However, the last 3-4 times that myself and my boyfriend have gone it has been a horrible experience. Our cups were filthy with lipstick from a previous customer, the plates were not properly washed, and our food was undercooked. I understand this place is very busy but being forgotten during our meal is also pretty sad! I've always wondered if the FDA has dropped in on this place randomly! If not, it should be done.   I will say the food is delicious but unless you want your food served on dirty dishes, I don't recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the standalone restaurant, but I've been to the BC kiosk a couple times before, and their coffee is reaaaaally really good. Like actually good. And the prices are spot on, plus all the people that work here are so pretty!!"}
{"text":"We had a large party for an early lunch. We were seated quickly, service was very attentive (the waitress even offered to do separate checks for us), the menu was creative and reasonably priced and the food was good. It was even pretty easy to get to - right off the elevator from the parking garage. I will definitely be going back. Don't forget to validate for free parking!"}
{"text":"An all time favorite breakfast spot.  I found it, using Yelp---as I was a visitor to downtn PHX.  Well,  what a discovery it was !!! There's a lovely outdoor patio area,  as well as indoor counter stools, & plenty of tables ---and large booths. The server was friendly, sweet, efficient & cute as could be. My hot food came out extremely fast.  It was delicious, and perfectly prepared. The mango iced tea was also excellent.  The entire place had a cool vibe. I'd come back here, every week if possible.  A+++"}
{"text":"We went in and stood at the podium for several minutes while all the employees walked by us like we were invisible. We finally asked someone if we could just grab a table. Then we sat there for over 10 min before someone handed us menus then the waiter came by for our order less than 30 seconds after we got the menus. He checked on is once. They had about one employee for every table so it wasn't like they were that busy. Coffee was ok. I like the Havana latte at LGO much better though. We both had the Breakfast Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Hash Browns, Bacon, Eggs & Fontina on Grilled Sourdough) aka cholesterol killer. It was decent but nothing special.  After we ate here this morning I was mentioning it to a friend of mine and she had eaten here before. She said the coffee was good, the Omlet wasn't so great and her companion stated \"the server has as much personality as when I'm sleeping.\". We must have had the same server. Easy on the eyes but not much else."}
{"text":"Great lunch! Can't do 5 stars only because cook should have been more careful when adding arugula to sandwich because we found a big glob of yellow wilted leaves in middle of sandwich. That was the Deli Aioli...I had tuna melt which was terrific. Homemade potato chips are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"It was the 3rd meet up for The Breakfast Club UYE this year, and had a good turn out! The placed picked this time was Breakfast Club downtown Phoenix at CityScape, now prior to the meet up I did call the Breakfast Club to let them know that we had a party of 10 to 15 coming in the morning on Sat, and the manager said no problem, we can put some tables together but it will work, so I said great, thank you and see ya on Sat!  Sat morning came and I checked in at the hostess told her that we are here and she said oh, I didn't know anything about you guys coming, if you don't mind waiting I have a table I can sit you at when the existing party leaves, said no problem and we waited.    We sat at a table that was sort of inside and outside, and it was a beautiful Sat morning for Phoenix, when we were waiting for the table, we passed around a menu so I already knew what I wanted. Everyone placed their orders and conversation was flowing and it was just a really good vibe.  The hostess and our server were very friendly and nice, love places that have great service, it makes you want to come back more.  Oh then the food started coming out, let me tell you, everything everyone ordered looked amazing! There were big blueberry pancakes, breakfast grilled cheese sandwich, turkey bene, huevos rancheros, breakfast burritos and more! I was pretty set on what I had ordered and when those plates starting coming out, I was drooling, it was cool seeing the menu in full color, every plate was beautifully prepared and vibrant in color.  My son ordered the breakfast burrito and a bowl of yogurt with berries, he said the yogurt was amazing, and he loved his breakfast burrito, he was stuffed and couldn't stop eating it, but he did and took half of it home and ate it for breakfast the next day.   I ordered chocolate chip pancakes, you can take me to a grown up place but I will still get me the chocolate chip pancakes haha. Also ordered a side of the potatoes Obrien, the pancakes were perfectly sweet and tasty! The syrup was in a glass bottle, like for olive oil, I thought man that's pretty sweet idea. On the potatoes Obrien I was just expecting potatoes with peppers, but what I got was so much better, huge home-style potatoes and nice slices of fresh peppers & onions!  My breakfast was delish baby!  It was a great breakfast club uye, look forward to the next one!"}
{"text":"Yum. Simple filling delicious breakfast spot. The service was adequate and prompt. We all ordered egg Benedict meal ( they have 4 different Benedict options). No wait or reservation required."}
{"text":"I met some friends for breakfast here today and left under enthused. I thought going in that it was affiliated with the breakfast club in downtown scottsdale but now that I've left I'm thinking not.  I'm still not sure either way. I got the Bird omelette - over cooked and under flavored in a big way. Coffee was good but  the creamer was so old it curdled my friend's coffee. Service wasn't great. Definitely not a destination breakfast spot. I'd only go again if I was nearby and not in the mood for something special."}
{"text":"I love that there's a separate place that you can order a quick bite \"to go\" and AMAZING COFFEE!!!! I'm still thinking about their coffee!   The service was amazing, the food was great, and I can't say enough about the coffee."}
{"text":"My husband and I were searching on Yelp for a restaurant to try in downtown Phoenix. We settled on visiting City Scape where there is some restaurants that are fairly new.  We parked in a nearby parking garage attached to part of City Scape. After walking around a little bit, we made our way across the street to the other side of City Scape and went up an escalator. Immediately we saw a center courtyard area with tables/umbrellas. The Breakfast Club has a small building where they make specialty coffee drinks. They have a sit down restaurant across from the the coffee building. We walked into the restaurant and were immediately greeted by a nice young waiter who seated us in a booth. We were handed menus and we noticed they serve both breakfast and lunch. We chose breakfast with coffee. We both decided to order the breakfast sandwich with hash browns, eggs, and two types of cheese on sourdough bread. Our waiter suggested we order it with the egg somewhat runny, stating: it's messy but good. We took his suggestion and it was an excellent one!  The breakfast sandwiches were delicious, fresh and hot. The Applewood bacon and hash browns were crisp. The yolk runny and delightful. It was by far one of the best breakfast sandwiches we've ever eaten.  Our waiter was friendly and nice.  We will return! As we were leaving, Blue Bunny employees was handing out coupons and free ice cream. We tried some and it was a perfect ending on a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"I've been coming for here for about 3 years its always a hit or miss with customer service sometimes the waitress are great and on point with service sometimes the waitress will not come back once to offer you coffee refill or ask for ketchup or sauces. BUT we keep coming back because the food is always delicious. I had my last straw on May 27 my friend and I went with her toddlers sat for 20 minutes with no service (while we saw other around us get service and food and people that came AFTER us got SERVICE AND FOOD) my friend was livid and wanted to leave I decided to stay because I come from Avondale and really wanted to eat at the moment I literally had to get up from my table go to the bar and ask for service. Once the service came she said she did not know we were her table even though she served everyone else around her. We order food it came it was cold yay! After this my friend was just done we order the check it came gave my debit card came back to let me know what color my card was because she could not find it! Yes they lost my debit card for 10 minutes had all the waiters looking around and asking me if I WAS SURE I had put it in the sleeve trying to give me the side eye of it, as I am trying to freeze my card she came back and found it. Charge me the full amount and I am a 20% tipper but this was literally the worst experience in my adult life. Never again will I be going and neither will my family and my friend."}
{"text":"Worked right next to this place for over a year. Should have gotten there sooner. Cant wait to try the Huevos con Masa. Incredible chipolte corn bread, moist and flavorful. Chorizo sausage and gravy with two eggs, definition of a savory."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass! Great food, coffee, service, and atmosphere. Don't listen to the keyboard warriors below with their irrelevant reviews. Top 5 breakfast place in Phoenix/Scottsdale"}
{"text":"It was hard to find this gem but after asking two people we found our way. We were greeted by the hostess when you first walk in you see the traditional diner seating but also the chair table and booths. We sat at a table our waitress was very nice we both had the French toast. I was not expecting it to be so much food but glad it was. They gave you these huge French toast on a platter there's about 4 of them. The atmosphere was warm everything about this place is great definitely will come back whenever I'm in the city."}
{"text":"We had a little bit of a hard time finding this restraurant (we we're from out of town ). It is on the 2nd story above The Arrogant Butcher. Look for the escalators.  Service was good, and prices were reasonable.  Our server gave us ice cold waters to go when we left,  which was greatly appreciated since it was hot"}
{"text":"My boss was visiting from Texas and we wanted to get a decent breakfast so I found this place...I would only suggest the signage be a bit better as I had to go around twice and then ask someone where it was as it's upstairs.  Once up there this is fabulous and the service was great."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food.    Probably the best breakfast I have ever had.  If you are into meat for breakfast you can't go wrong with the \"whole hog\" omelette. For a little spice and pepper to your morning go with the BC Bloody Mary. And to cool it down, build your own pancake with some amazing options like mixed berries and bananas fosters."}
{"text":"WOW what a great deal for your $$!  This is a spacious spot located right in downtown Phoenix near the Palomar.  I went here for breakfast and was shocked at how much food portions are.  It is hard to screw up breakfast and the Breakfast Club did everything 'just fine'.   We had a large party and they quickly got tables put together for us.  I never had to ask for a refill on coffee - they came by often and were very nice.  Would definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Coffee and a breakfast bowl with pork & green chile stew on top!! Really great."}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast and were pleasantly surprised by the amount of food.  We just wanted basic diner breakfast but nothing in site, so were initially thinking it was too fancy.  We are big eaters and we left full so, its good.  The people were friendly too.  There's a big window, so you can people watch."}
{"text":"My second favorite place to have breakfast! Sorry it couldn't be my first but that doesn't mean it's lacking in anything. The food first of all is delicious always. Every time I go I'm never disappointed. The wait is never too long although it can be quite lengthy on Sunday mornings which is not an issue for me, I've even downloaded that app that informs you on your place in line. The staff is always delightful. Never had an issue. The outside seating is lovely and I love the location. I try to go as often as possible."}
{"text":"Busy place . Easy in easy out . Try out the border bowl it's one of the best things on there menu."}
{"text":"I live downtown and often visit BC. Today I received the worst service since coming here. My friends and I frequent this place often and usually have a really good experience.   Today we arrived and and had to wait longer then expected to be seated. we then noticed that people that arrived after us were being sat before us. No problem mistakes happen. However, when we brought it to hostess attention we recieved attitude and no apology. Then we ordered drinks as we usually do. They got the drink orders wrong and again we were greeted with attitude.  I am huge on customer service and therefore will not be returning to BC."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we are here so we tried it out again for brunch today.  I remembered not liking this place but I was really pleasantly surprised today.  I had the Lean and Green omlette which was huge and came with a beautiful side of fruit and potatoes.  The potatoes were a little bland but that was easily fixed with salt and pepper.  Good service and a nice patio made for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"This was my go to place for breakfast while working in downtown Phoenix for the week. I got the quick start with a slight modification, a slice of french toast instead of regular toast. I've eaten it three days in a row...why you might ask? Can't I venture out? Try something new? Normally yes, but when you've got something good going, why change it?   The food is great. When I wake up at 4am all I can think about is that bacon and the french toast with real maple syrup. I actually wait until 620 to start walking over from my hotel. The bacon- I don't know what they do to it but its like a freshly fried pig and yes it tastes great. The one slice of french toast isn't too sweet, too soggy or too similar to a plain slice of bread (you've had those bland french toasts before). Its perfect---its just the right amount of sweet, with spice and doesn't leave you stuffed.   The biggest plus---the place is dirt cheap for the quality."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this spot for breakfast. Stopped in after a 5k downtown. We had 8 in our party and we were told there would be a 20 min wait for our size. Within 10 minutes we were seated with drinks and menus! The server was friendly and knowledgeable. They have a wide array of breakfast foods and cocktails for everyone's likes. I ordered the breakfast burrito and told the server I was a vegetarian so no meat at all. He immediately told me they cook the black beans in pork- which for a vegetarian is a no! I was so grateful how thoughtful he was with the small details of the menu. That in itself would make me come back!   To round it off they have a great outdoor area for seating. The server did mess up our tabs and charged mine with 2 of the other couples but he caught it before bringing it to us and had the manager come over to tell us what happened and to apologize (nice service touch!)  This is truly a must try downtown, whether sitting inside or out!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick breakfast, diner style.  Breakfast Club sandwich arrived quickly after ordering and the horseradish mayonnaise was a great compliment to the Fontina cheese.  Prices were surprisingly low.  Full bar also apparently available.  Service was fast and friendly.  Thumbs up for: convenience, price, taste, service."}
{"text":"Huge portions and great prices! I got the huevos rancheros and my mom got the eggs benedict. We both were very happy with our choices. We also both had small iced coffees, which were huge and very good! Easy to find in CityScape. If you're staying at the hotel, you can walk right out the lobby doors and you're there."}
{"text":"I work nearby to this restaurant and it is super convenient for a quick lunch. This location is better than the Scottsdale location in my opinion - usually a much shorter wait. The club pro is my favorite breakfast drink there!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out on Saturday because I heard so many great things. Me and my family stopped here to eat before comicon last weekend and we were disappointed. The waitress seemed to only care about her own reflection in the mirror and never brought me water I asked for. Then when my food arrived my bacon had a really long piece if hair in it!! Not to mention the entire restaurant was covered in flies all over our food and hanging out on the windows. It all together did not sit well in my stomach for me. However the manager was very apologetic and comped my meal and closed the doors so flies would not get in. All together I do not think we will go here again :("}
{"text":"This place was just ok. About a 15 minute wait on a Saturday, not too bad. When they sat us, they put us at a table with other people. Very odd. I looked around and saw no one else was sharing a table so we asked them later to move us because a lot of tables opened up and they did. The service was very good. The food was just ok. I got the eggs Benedict and my husband got the omelet. For a place labeled as a breakfast spot, they didn't have tons of options and the food was mediocre. Def not on the level of Snooze or First Watch. I don't think we would go back."}
{"text":"Love the iced coffee, especially that they give you another cup to go! They let dogs on their gorgeous outside patio which is a plus for me!"}
{"text":"You have to try the French toast.  They make it with challah bread! What more do you need to know?    This place is light and airy.  Actually part of the dining room is outside which is perfect for Phoenix.  We were here a week ago Saturday and while the place was busy our waitress was attentive without hovering.    The coffee is also very good but you do not get unlimited refills. (This is not the worst thing in the world but unlimited refills is kinds of standard for coffee.)"}
{"text":"I love The Breakfast Club. The food is delicious, the staff incredibly friendly and expedient, and the prices are good. I have been here for both breakfast and lunch several times, and the quality of the food and service are both consistent. Also, their coffee is divine! Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Martha was our server today at the beautiful breakfast club at cityscape downtown. We arrived late morning with it being fairly busy. She treated us with the utmost attention while servicing other guest. People often take for granted outstanding service, and she was nothing less than outstanding. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Met a coworker here for brunch.  We sat outside to enjoy the lovely sunny day, and nice 80 degree weather.  Our waitress was friendly, and attentive.   I had the huevos rancheros, and they were able to accommodate my dietary restriction.  Which was nice.   The food came out hot, and everything was flavorful.  The eggs were cooked over medium perfecto.  The salsa was mild and was tasty.   I personally prefer hot salsa but this was good.   I tried my coworkers breakfast potatoes and OMG they were delicious!  I will be ordering those next time."}
{"text":"The place and the ambiance are very nice but it's super busy during lunch time (I haven't been there for breakfast) and it always takes them forever to get our orders and sometimes we even end up getting our food in to go boxes because they take that long.   I get it, it's a nice place Downtown and it gets packed during lunch but having customers who have 1h lunch wait for over 35 minutes to get their food isn't right.  Also, today, two of my coworkers waited for over 40 minutes and when their food arrived it was the wrong order. Ditto they brought the right plate like 15 minutes later and they didn't charge for their food but it seems to be it'd be easier to have 2-3 more employees to help during peak hours.  Their food's really good. I usually have the turkey wrap and it's delicious and the Caesar salad portion's huge to be a side salad. Too bad they don't have pasta salad anymore because it was delicious.  So all in all it's a nice place to go for lunch if you're not in a hurry. It only gets 3 starts because of the long time they take to cook/bring food but their food itself's actually really good.  Give it a try! Just make sure you go there with plenty of time."}
{"text":"I am a huge sucker for delicious breakfast cuisine and this place is one of my new favorites! Highly recommend the Border Bowl, especially with the request of two eggs scrambled and mixed in and the other two eggs over easy served on top... Perfection!   Freshly squeezed juice is on par!"}
{"text":"First time here waitstaff very busy .. not very tentive and found black dead lettuce in my salad and in the arugala in my sandwhich wont be back"}
{"text":"If I was just reviewing the Dirty chai latte, this review would gets 5 stars on its own. But let's get into the rest of the food... I ordered the eggs Benedict which was pretty good, mostly because the sauce was pretty tasty. Potatoes were cooked well but lacked flavor and didn't finish them. My fianc√© ordered the biscuits and gravy and literally almost threw up from eating them. He said the sauce was weird and pointed out to me how it was greasy and literally separating in front of us. He commented that it look and tasted like it had been sitting in the back for awhile. Now let me just say, that this is the first time he has had this reaction to something he has eaten. It's not normal for him to complain about the food and I even had to convince him to bring it up to the waitress. He took one bite and that was it. There's no way it was fair for him to pay for it! Service was great though! We had a girl that was training and she did wonderfully, I wish I could have gotten her name. (Her highlight was on point tho! :) We informed her about the gravy, she apologized immensely and we got it taken off our bill. Probably won't be coming back here again for the food but would prob pop in for that dirty chai latte. 1 star for dirty chai latte 1 star for wonderful waitress 1 star for hollandaise sauce"}
{"text":"Such a SHAME that the food is really good here and the SERVICE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST. I refilled my own waters, picked up my own coffee from the bar and cleaned up our spilled orange juice 20 minutes after the server spilled it and said \"OOPS sorry Ill grab the busser to clean it up\". Just HORRIFIC. Biscuits and gravy were perfection but with service like that I won't be back. I also saw many other tables waiting to even order drinks unfortunately. Sad."}
{"text":"Started with coffee and Mimosa's. Both were good.  I had the Fried Chicken with gravy and two sunnyside up eggs. It also came with home fries and a fruit salad. Good stuff. Sticks to your ribs.  My other half had the Biscuits and Gravy, with scrambled eggs. She didn't like it. The biscuit's were bone dry and no amount of gravy was going to fix it."}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on with this place - the service was horrible today!  Slow, inaccurate and inconsistent! This place has gone way downhill! No wonder it's dead!"}
{"text":"I didn't think this place lived up to the reviews at all! Pretty disappointed actually. I ordered the french toast and it was barely cooked! Lets say it was lightly seared on each side. Disgusting. And at $10 an order, very disappointing. My husband had the breakfast bowl and he enjoyed that, said it was a bit spicy though and he loves spicy food. For the money, this place is not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Such good high quality breakfast! A lot of attention to details and all fresh made food. I had the sirloin Benedict which was awesome. Really good flavors. And the server was extremely helpful."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and enjoyed the service!  We sat outside on a pretty cool and shady morning so it was pretty comfortable.  As for the service my only complaint was the speed of service for waiting for the check.  I'll admit our waitress only came up to us twice while we were eating to check on us,  but that's what I prefer.  I hate when a server comes up every five minutes and interrupts conversation,  so this was an awesome change from a corporate ihop kind of service.   Anyways, as for the food there was pluses and minuses to both our dishes so I'd say a B+ over all.  I had the original Ben which was super filling and can say is worth the $10. The sauce is nothing fancy,  but the ham is really what makes it.  My boyfriend ordered the quick start with four eggs.  Also super filing and worth the money.  Again the meat was the best part,  but the jelly was actually the star of the show. I just wish the potatoes had some more seasoning and the fruit was a little fresher.   Ps order the orange juice, is definitely freshly squeezed and so refreshing!  Also had my first espresso here so can't say much other than it was so black and strong."}
{"text":"Our groups favorite place in downtown! The eggs benedict are superb! Inside, outside and bar seating.. Plenty of room to accommodate big groups but equally nice for a one on one date. More often than not, this is the place we find ourselves on Saturday mornings!! Mostly because they serve breakfast until they close!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here before the baseball this past Sunday. It was a lot less packed than I expected ( good for us). We sat at the counter which was nice and spacious and even had a TV for every 3 or 4 seats (nothing like watching some wrestling and rhythmic gymnastics at breakfast...).  Our server/ barista-tender was a bit curt at first, but was very pleasent by the time our food came. My husband had the \"Nutty\" waffle w/ candied almonds and walnuts. He thought the bottle they give you syrup in was \"really smart\". He also enjoyed the food. I had the \"Lean and green\" omelet (spinach, broccoli, onions, peppers, and I opted to add turkey sausage). Even with adding the sausage, there was not enough filling in the omelet. Partially, I think, because it was super fluffy. It was also super delicious, lack of veggies aside. It also came w/ a small mountain of fresh fruit and potatoes O'Brien. Their \"potatoes O'Brien\" are not potatoes O'Brien. I had a large amount of largely cubed, undercooked, potatoes w/ no seasoning and one or two bits of onion and pepper. Worst potatoes Ive had in a while.  Our overall experience was good, but seriously, opt for something other than potatoes as a breakfast side."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, food, coffee and staff are great! I love going to both BC's, Phoenix and Scottsdale. We enjoyed sitting at the bar this time just to get junked out on coffee. Ask for our waitress, her name is Barista"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, awesome place to get breakfast. I had steak and eggs, the filet was cooked perfectly and was super tender. Everyone's plates around me looked delicious as well. I would go back again without hesitation."}
{"text":"I was trying to go to the other location in Scottsdale, but since that one seems to be always crowded I was glad that the one in PHX has more room.  We came here before the opera, and it was a good option instead of the places closer to the Symphony Hall. I had a sandwich with fruit salad that was well served, so I had to take the other half for dinner. My other friends enjoyed a mushroom omelet and a build your own brunch option.   Good service and trendy decoration."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot located next to the Palomar. The service was great and the portions are huge! I ate here a couple of times during my stay and enjoyed every bite. The fruit that accompanies each dish is fresh and always features pineapple, melon and watermelon. It's difficult to mess up breakfast food, but it's even more difficult to make breakfast food that stands out from the crowd. The Breakfast Club manages to stand heads and tails above others with ease."}
{"text":"Met a friend and had early breakfast. Loved their simple Menu. I had the Quickstart conscious dish, it was really delicious and definitely filling for the morning. I did not care much for their coffee, in all honesty, Starbucks tastes better than theirs. Other than that the outdoor seating is amazing and as well as the  bar seating."}
{"text":"Originally I had a very high rating for this place but I have to say I was VERY disappointed in their reservation system. There were multiple parties sat that arrived after us and was told they have a call ahead service of 15 minutes or less. Parties arrived well after and got seated. We then asked how many people were ahead and was told 5. We WATCHED 3 parties get sat and asked again and was told 4. Had no idea I didn't know simple asthmatic.   Questioning returning but the food is always good."}
{"text":"As a daily diner in downtown Phoenix, I'll be surprised if the doors to this place stay open for more than 6 months.  I was so excited to have The Breakfast Club open in downtown and now I hazard to say even First Watch (which is hospital cuisine at best) far exceeds what I had at the Breakfast Club in CityScape.  I've now been to this restaurant three times since it opened hoping for an exceptional experience and I'm totally underwhelmed.  Today, I brought 2 family members to the restaurant and even though the service was exceptional, the quality of the food was horrible and it was all cold.  We had pre-cooked cardboard bacon, flavorless sausage patties, petite pancakes, and ice cold eggs.  Plating was haphazard and uninviting and worse of all, every hot dish was ice cold.  Since I was already at this location 2 times and each time I had to send food back because it was cold, I knew to order my syrup hot.  That was the only way we could eat the pancakes without sending them back.  Considering this is a breakfast restaurant, I can't believe they find it so difficult to serve hot, flavorful food.  I really hope they immediately step up their effort because Matt's Big Breakfast, Cartel Coffee, and sadly First Watch have nothing to worry about.  I've waited too long to see downtown Phoenix succeed and unfortunately without remedial action, the Breakfast Club will not be a part of it."}
{"text":"Amazing filet mignon Benedict and the service is great! Food brought out super fast! I would recommend to anyone in the downtown Phoenix area!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with great food and atmosphere. Plates are big and they don't skimp out on champagne in the mimosa's. Will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Cool place, outdoor seating has sprinklers which were unfortunately never turned on for us on a hot summer morning ): the food is great! Servers are nice and attentive. Defiantly a great breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"The Tuscan was delicious, and not outrageously expensive. Nice price conscious options on menu. The other diners breakfasts looked delicious too. Want to try the French toast on next visit. Lovely outside dining, and prompt, courteous service! Bloody Mary was also very nice with lots of garnishes."}
{"text":"in town for a conference and craving 'real food'/a substantial breakfast to start the day - breakfast club, walking distance to our hotel, completely delivered.  our server was super friendly, though we were sleepy and indecisive; she recommended the french toast side we ordered to be made ala bananas foster - YUM.  more like dessert but nothing wrong with dessert for breakfast...  otherwise we had fairly standard egg dishes but they were yummy, fresh, served quickly, and exactly what we needed.  the *only* complaint i have is wayfinding - perhaps, since they were setting up for an event downstairs, it was moved - but there were ZERO signs on ground level, and while we could smell bacon/coffee/breakfast, we had to lap the block a few times and only found it because we figured we may as well try the escalator...  a few signs would go far."}
{"text":"This place definitely is no disappointment. You want a good breakfast and decent selection come here. Went at about 830am and it wasnt busy at all on a Saturday. Only big down side is the young lady at the bar area couldn't keep up with the few people she had sitting at the bar and service was very slow. We got our food and had no silverware, had to go find some myself. Other than that portions are good to and food is tasty!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, nothing special, probably could make better at home. I had the Foster French Toast and it was bananas with caramel, syrup, and ice cream, not my idea of \"fostered\". Mimosas were served in pint glasses with a straw. Had to asked for coffee refills. Pricey for a mediocre breakfast. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"So I was putting the waiters threw college, passing out mad tipping action $$$ I would visit everyday and sometimes twice a day. I was taking my co-workers, clients, friends and family. I think that I'm still the Duke on Yelp.... then the management turned on me when they caught a bad review... so I got a lifetime ban from the owners because rather than to work with me and help to improve the services they offer, management found it easier to black ball me. Ever got black balled before? Once in Trump tower and now BC... I'm a Bad Hombre I guess. They have no loyalty to the clients and in business it's all about the clients."}
{"text":"Over-priced and really not good. There are better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Had the eggs Benedict. It was ok no the worst not the best. Eggs were a little overcooked . The sauce was good but thick and not enough. Ham was great !"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a 3.5 star overall rating.  My wife and I ate breakfast and lunch here on consecutive days.  The staff was great on both occasions, service was quick, the food was really good, we left feeling this place was the best we experienced after staying at the Hotel Palomar for 4 nights.  We'll be eating there tomorrow for breakfast before our flight out.  Just watch out for the owners of a large bloodhound that gets fed with the patron's own fork at lunch in the outdoor seating area.   Disgusting!"}
{"text":"We needed to kill some time before going to the game at Chase Field so we decided to get some breakfast.  The location is in some weird urban thing wedged in between a couple of hotels.  You have to go up an escalator or stairs to get there (or walk through the hotel and take an elevator).  It can be a bit hard to find.  We sat outside though, and enjoyed doing some people watching.  Both my friend and I had the breakfast grilled cheese sandwich.  Bread, eggs, cheese, and hash browns.  It was good, but the hash browns made it too dry tasting.  Ketchup might have helped (but I was too hungry to stop eating and ask for some).  Mayo might have worked too.  But yeah, it was an okay size and about what I expected for the price (around $7 I believe).  I also got the chipotle biscuits and gravy.  It was okay.  It was actually just one biscuit.  The gravy sauce was different, neither good nor bad, but I think I would prefer just some normal white gravy.  I think it was about $4 which was too much for just one biscuit.  Nothing really bad about this place, but nothing really great either."}
{"text":"Yummy Yum Yum!! Quality food prepared properly.  Portions are .....large, so be hungry or ask for 1/2."}
{"text":"Good food and the staff is pretty good too.  Eating outside is great when the weather permits.  The burrito bowl is excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast!  Helps that I'm walking distance away from the Cityscape location.  There is typically a wait to be seated, but it's worth the wait.  We often sit at the counter since it's first come, first serve.  The fresh squeezed juice is great, especially added to a greyhound or mimosa!  My favorite dishes are BC Sandwich or Breakfast Grilled Cheese."}
{"text":"Top notch. Great food. A little pricy but you get what you pay for  Been there twice and  try the potatoes. It's not like diner type laptops but roasted with onions and peppers.   Service is outstanding.   My only complaint was the cappchino - hardly any foam.   Great place to people watch"}
{"text":"Cool, hidden, trendy breakfast spot. The food was absolutely delicious. The bacon is highly recommended. Even though the drinks may seem a little stiff, they're pretty strong. So all is worth the amount you pay. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went for Saturday morning brunch. The waitress suggested the chicken fried chicken.  Two of us got that and one got the French dip. The French dip was good but nothing special and the tomato soup was good.  I don't normally get something like a chicken fried chicken, but I'm so glad I did. The chicken and gravy was delicious. The fried eggs needed some seasoning and the potatoes were good but not great. The chicken was amazing, though!"}
{"text":"Good menu options, offered a \"to go\" cup of coffee and had outdoor seating available. I had the filet benedict. The 3 stars are because the meat was not fresh. It had that, \"Is this still good? Well, is not expired to the point that it will get anyone ill, so let's use it,\" taste. I probably should have known better than to order it."}
{"text":"This is a neat and somewhat trendy breakfast eatery. It is located right outside the Hotel Palomar (very short walk).  They specialize in breakfast foods. I got some very good scrambled eggs along with Eggs Benedict. The scrambled eggs were very good. The Eggs Benedict was ok, 3/5 due to the fact that the sauce wasn't spectacular and the Eggs Benedict was slightly overlooked. I like my Eggs Benedict slightly runny and these were firm (even though I ordered runny).   No big deal. A good meal, slightly higher priced, good location, good service, and a nice relaxing atmosphere.  I would recommend this eatery!   Overall, 4/5."}
{"text":"great food, awful service...that seems to get worse and worse every visit. sure the food will probably keep me coming back, but on my most recent visit i waited 15 minutes after being seated before i had to flag down a waitress to try to find out who was supposed to be serving our table. this is due to either poor miscommunication between staff members, or sheer ignorance on the part of the wait staff. I'm guessing both.  As far as the food goes, the breakfast grilled cheese is practically gold on a sandwich! The benedicts are quite delicious as well although they nixed my favorite one from the menu (filet mignon topped with poached egg and blue crab meat)... The fresh squeezed juice is also amazing, especially the V-18 (try the bloody mary made with this)."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for the weekend for a baseball game and came here based on location and yelp reviews. Only waited about 10 minutes for a table on Saturday morning around 10am, and the wait staff was friendly and attentive on a busy Saturday. Food was super reasonably priced and tasty. Not the best brunch of my life, but definitely great food for a good price! They had some awesome looking breakfast cocktails, but we did not partake  Definitely recommend the Breakfast Grilled Cheese Sandwich!! But I had to split it with my fianc√© cause it was so heavy!!   Note about the place - it is a little hard to find. The entrance is up the stairs on a side street, not on Jefferson, so we walked around the block a couple times before figuring it out!  Would absolutely recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Got the 4 white eggs with cottage cheese and fruit. Filled me up! Service was a bit slow but was nice to sit outside."}
{"text":"4 of us went for breakfast here on a Sunday morning. We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated and the seats are outside \"shaded\" with huge umbrellas that if someone moves it to get more shade on your table you are screwed. Also I'm surprise that with the heat that we get in summers they don't have misters, so be ready to sweat while eating your breakfast . Food was okay."}
{"text":"After our antelope canyon tour We stop here and it was delicious  4 people barely any people and fast service."}
{"text":"We came here on our last day in Phoenix before we headed back to CA and we had a great meal with great service and fair prices. It was busy but we were able to be seated outdoor with no wait. There were umbrellas so the area was shaded. We plan on coming back so we'll definitely be eating here again :)"}
{"text":"When I was in Phoenix I decided to look up brunch spots on Yelp and found that Breakfast Club was super close to our hotel. Our waiter John was super friendly and helped me choose between a few options I was interested in.  I settled on the Huevos Rancheros and an Iced Coffee.  Both were tasty. The Huevos Rancheros was huge I couldn't eat all of it. I did enjoy them but have had better.  The Iced coffee was good but how can you mess that up. Seems like this is a busy place, we got there just at the right time as there was a wait soon after we sat down.  I loved the outdoor seating option but since it was steamy we stayed inside."}
{"text":"Great hearty meal at great price.  Border bowl --  A little heat. Green peppers, egg, cheese, potatoes and tender, flavorful pork. This breakfast was full of flavor and will fill you up to start the day.   French toast -- sweet and crispy. The butter is amazing."}
{"text":"Ok, likely to go back but service needs help.  Food looked outstanding, tasted great, but nothing that special. Don't go if your in a rush...  I sat at the bar and it was a Sunday, but waiting 10+ minutes to get recognized and a drink is a bit long for the bar (employees seemed to be arguing who's customer it was). Once ordered it was pretty typical and clockwork, check was dropped half way thru, followed by another 5 min later (lending me and my bar mates to discuss who's check was what...). This was followed by another 10 minutes before anyone came back to retrieve the checks (and some pissed off looks when the \"waiters\" had to clear plates, not the \"buss boys\").  Might give it a second chance next time I am in town, maybe it's better and more efficient on weekdays.  TIP - ITS ON THE SECOND FLOOR PLAZA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLOCK, BETWEEN OFFICE BUILDINGS (next to the \"tilted kilt\" which you can see from the street). Was challenging to find, as it's not on the actual street and up a few floors."}
{"text":"The breakfast border bowl was so delicious!! Don't really have much more to say but it might be my favorite breakfast place while I'm in town"}
{"text":"Another jury duty lunch escapade! There was about 10 of us and it took about 20 min for that big of a group to be seated which was great for the busy downtown Phoenix rush.   I believe everyone got lunch this time around and some highlights include great black tea, huge wraps (highly recommended ) and super quick service!   We were able to spilt the check as well which was another plus.   Great environment. Usually would recommend the outside seating but it was extremely windy so it was closed during lunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. I had the grilled cheese breakfast sandwich which was very good. Service was good and the outdoor seating was perfect for a cool morning in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I placed an order for pickup, but it took me 4-5 tries to get through. Parking is a beast during the week, carry out parking would be nice.   The staff is friendly and the food is super fresh. The border bowl is big enough to share, so prepare yourself if you order solo."}
{"text":"Way cool!  We found another breakfast join in Phoenix!  Food was good, french toast with berries...very good!  As for the service...it could be better.  Our waitress looked tired, had an attitude like she didn't want to be there and didn't really care.  She could at least smile!  But as for the food, not bad!!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was going to have lunch at the Strand this afternoon, but decided to have breakfast instead. I found the Breakfast Club on yelp because I hadn't eaten breakfast yet and I was in a mood for coffee and eggs. Great choice! I sat at the counter, and the friendly waitress immediately offered me something to drink. I asked for a cup of coffee with a shot of hazelnut flavor and Stevia. My server recommended the grilled breakfast sourdough sandwich with Fontina. Since I don't eat bacon, she offered a substitute. She said I could switch it to Avocado. Lovely! That automatically gained her extra stars. I love establishments that offer a substitute without extra added fees, so I recommend Breakfast Club. Delish, reasonable and great service too!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time with a few friends after a night of drinking. It was pretty busy, which is a good sign. The service wasn't anything spectacular and the food was good, but not great. I ordered the Southwest salad and cup of roasted tomato soup. The salad was pretty generous on the lettuce, but not on the toppings. The soup was actually one of the worst tomato soups I have had. Everybody else ordered breakfast and they seemed to enjoy it. I will probably return again and give it a second chance, perhaps for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. They sat us at a dirty table, rushed us to order and the entire time I felt like I was being hurried to eat. We had been there for less than an hour and were asked if we could move because they needed the table for a large party. It was extremely rude and I will never go there again."}
{"text":"This is a 3 out of 5 day stop for me now.  I have to admit that I haven't strayed from the Breakfast Grilled Cheese sandwich for the last few weeks.  Its THAT good.  Its not really productive for review writing, though.   Lately I've modified the sandwich to sub wheat instead of white, and egg whites instead of egg normals.  Personally, its better now.  I love the taste of egg anything and the whites give a good uniform egg taste.  The size of the sandwich hasn't changed; still huge.  I couldn't finish it one sitting anymore.  So I started ordering half a sandwich which isn't on the menu, but the folks there make it for me anyway.  I have unfortunately paid like 3 different prices for it since different people take the order.  Half a sandwich should be half the price, but its usually only about $2 off.  Whatever. I'd be better off just getting the whole thing and saving the other half for lunch. The sandwich's price went up $2 since my first review...so did a LOT of other items.  I knew they would modify their menu, but I didn't think they'd go up so much on so many things.  Oh well.  Its two steps away from me and the Breakfast Grilled Cheese is probably all I'll ever buy.  So yeah they got me. Another reason other than the sandwich that they'll keep four stars is their service.  I order as soon as they open at 7am and every person is always friendly.  I've gotten offered samples of their awesome OJ or apple juice while I wait.  And there are two of the folks that recognize me now.  Service and plain ol' friendliness goes a long way with me. I'll be going here as long as their there."}
{"text":"What a beautiful morning and breakfast in downtown Phoenix.  Service was friendly and attentive food was delicious and plentiful.  Nick was my server and took great care of me. He asked questions and did what ever he couldn't to make sure I had everything I needed.  Even offered me coffee or water for the road."}
{"text":"We came for Mother's Day brunch and it was absolutely amazing!!! I cannot wait to go back.   I had the egg white omelette with potatoes and the fresh toast with candied pecans. Everything was delicious! The orange juice is to die for. Probably the best 4$ juice on the planet."}
{"text":"Went on a roller coaster of ups and downs here , but overall it was a pleasant experience .   Was greeted by the hostess with the mostess.  After getting seated we waited about 15 minutes for someone to come greet us , finally a good server named Eric ( if I remember correctly , tall blonde guy) , apologized for the miscommunication and was transparent about what happened .  He was great the whole time so my first impression I soon forgot . The Latte was delicious however the first glass had lipstick on it . Made me another quickly and it's honestly one of the better lattes I have had .   Eggs Benedict was great , food overall was pretty good .  Eric was great and corrected any issues and was really apologetic about us waiting .  Beautiful day made it awesome   And to the hostess that sat us with the most perfect butt ever , I love you ."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! It was recommended by the hotel concierge and was a hit.  My husband had the chicken fried chicken.  After a bite of that I was a little jealous.  I had the ham and eggs which were almost as good.  Peppers and onions served with the potatoes were very tasty, ham was country (salted) a great balance with eggs and toast.  The fresh squeezed juice was a bit expensive but great quality.  Service was quick and friendly though we felt a little rushed to leave."}
{"text":"Had an omelette very good flavor. Freshly squeezed juice bar. Had a greyhound drink was awesome and strong, the Bloody Mary was also good. Everything is fresh and made to order. Would definitely come back to try something new. Great friendly service with out door patio area."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Breakfast Club. The environment was nice with a fresh modern design feel. Fresh grapefruit juice was delicious and the service was helpful and friendly. The breakfast burrito topped with green chili was great. Living downtown, I can see this becoming a regular breakfast place. yum."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Amazing food and service as always. The host has the doors held open so the cold air from the restaurant will blow on him in the outside. This is allowing mass amounts of house flies to buzz all over my food and face. If I wanted to sit outside I would have requested it. If there are that many flies in the dining area it makes me wonder whats going on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The wait was minimal, the service was great.. the food..DELICIOUS! Don't miss the opportunity to try this gem in Phoenix.  Turkey Benedict was \"Da Bomb\" and Huevos Rancheros were very filling. You can't go wrong if you choose this restaurant."}
{"text":"i had a most favorable breakfast at the breakfast club wednesday morning.  the weather was lovely so i sat in the patio.  all i want to tell y'all is order the v-18 juice if you like tomotoe or v-8 juice.  and if you are an egg benedicts fanatic, i highly recommend and you will relish each morsel.  service from malika was absolutely delightful.  thanks for a fantastic kick start morning to my day."}
{"text":"Love BC been going here for years! Pinenut crusted chicken is da bomb!!"}
{"text":"Clean, simple and downtown.  Breakfast Club reminds me of an upgraded Denny's.  The coffee was nutty and hot.  The waitress even gave me a cup to go.  I had a plain waffle and eggs on the side.  Not the best waffle I've had but good. The eggs were cooked perfectly. Great place for students to study and have breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! We were visiting Phoenix for spring training and luckily found this gem of a breakfast restaurant. Breakfast in Phoenix had been disappointing until Alexis served us and was so awesome! She went through the menu for us as it was our first time.   I had the French toast with strawberries and whipped cream and my boyfriend had the chicken fried chicken. French toast was huge and very delicious. I would have preferred less whipped cream and more strawberries, but that's preference. My boyfriends chicken fried chicken was exceptional as even the potatoes and peppers were phenomenal.   If you're in the downtown area, you must check out the great patio on beautiful mornings!"}
{"text":"THis place is delicious. The first time I came I ordered the Cobb salad and it was great. The second time I came here I ordered the BLT with turkey and it was even more BANGIN'!!! Everyone I have brought to this restaurant has loved it.  I brought a work crowd here for lunch and it was the perfect setting. This is now my go-to restaurant whenever I'm hungry downtown.  Also, I learned that they validate parking in cityscape. Next time I won't park in the street!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times already and the food and atmosphere are great! The staff are awesome and I get treated well, only thing is that I wish they had more seating because this place gets busy busy! Which is great but not when I'm hungry lol. But if you haven't eaten here yet! You should! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Not as good today.  Service was not great and eggs and meat were overcooked.   Quality is slipping"}
{"text":"The food was incredible, however the service was not. Ten minutes after we got our plates our checks were dropped off, without asking if we wanted another round of mimosas or anything else. My friend had not even finished half her waffle and the waitress came and started to take her plate off the table. Overall the staff came across as rude and rushed. Definitely not a friendly breakfast place. But the food was definitely good."}
{"text":"The setting reminds me of an upscale diner and every time I have been in it has been packed. I usually opt to sit at the bar because the service is much faster. Last time I came in I had the veggie omelet, and while drowning in cheese it was still pretty good. The accompanying toast was pre-buttered (I hate that) and the potatoes lacked flavor.   All in all this place is a pretty solid breakfast spot, if you are not expecting more than your average diner food."}
{"text":"It was kind of hot and crowded in there. The food was average. My juice cost $7....a little pricey but it was good.  Overall, I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either."}
{"text":"Great place to grab brunch. A little hard to locate since it's inside of a hotel complex. We got dropped off via uber and there's not really a place to be dropped off but beside that the food was great. Lots of classic breakfast options and some thematic southwest dishes."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! Tasty Bloody Mary's. Busy on a Saturday morning but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict perfection. solid service. Although skip the grapefruit juice its like 9 bucks for a large"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place when I posted that I was going to Phoenix. I had tried Matt's Big Breakfast the day before and was glad this place was a bit closer to the Westin since I was walking. I think it's a solid choice for breakfast and has great service.  B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- If you're walking, you have to take the escalator to get to it -- Friendly and attentive staff -- Whole hog omelette was very tasty & the creme fraiche broke the heavy meat flavor -- Upgraded my toast and hashbrowns for biscuits and gravy -- Biscuits are jalapeno cheddar & they add a red drizzle to the gravy -- Get the biscuits and gravy! -- French toast was good but not mind blowing  I actually had a great breakfast before I left Phoenix. The service was great and I was so undecided that my server really helped me out. As soon as she mentioned the jalepeno cheddar biscuits, I was sold!  I ended upgrading my potatoes (which I don't like much anyways) and toast for the biscuits and gravy. It came out with my whole hog omelette and some fruit. The fruit cup was small but definitely had some fresh melons, etc. I'm not a big fruit eater. The omelette was very meaty but I definitely enjoyed the chorizo the most. I added a little ketchup and the creme fraiche really helped break the the meat taste.  The biscuits and gravy were very tasty and meaty. My only complaint was that they were warm and not hot. I think that was the only real downside to my experience here. Overall the food was warm not hot. And we all know there's nothign like some hot and fresh food.  I also tried a slice or two of the french toast since I couldn't get any at Matt's the day before. It was average french toast. Sweet and savory with decent syrup.   I definitely would recommend this location. It has a great feel and the menu has a lot to offer. I loved the southwest twist on the biscuits and gravy, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Just discovered the place just took my first bite delicious service has been very nice very prompt very courteous I like this place. I Enjoying this so much that It all  taste fabulous potatoes are cooked just like I like them coffee was nice strong hot I definitely recommend this place I will be back"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. I had the whole hog omelet. My omelet was overcooked and nothing spectacular/special. The decor and feel of this place was plain. No wait to get a seat on a Wednesday morning."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this place only gets 3.5 stars. We have been twice now trying entirely different things, and everything has been superb. I will say the prices are a bit steep for breakfast food, but it is always spot on.  The kids have had the French toast both times (an instant favorite, well cooked, thick slices). They've also enjoyed the bacon and eggs and fruit, and the overpriced $4 8oz cup of fresh squeezed apple juice. Legit juice, though.   We've tried the traditional bene, the Huevos con masa, the lean and green and the quick start with a cub of granola. All over the board with that list. All good choices.   I remember really loving the bene the first time we went. Super filling, perfectly cooked, generous sauce - indulgent, yet not heavy and worth it. I remember liking the consistency and texture of the English muffins as well. The potatoes O'brien were crisp outside and soft inside (like all potatoes should be.).   The lean and green was just that, light and perfect for people that don't eat big breakfasts. Could have done without the broccoli.   The Huevos con masa was unique and if you like Mexican for breakfast, it's a good way to go. Not sure we've ever had anything like it. Rich spicy flavor with a pleasant hint of sweet in the masa that didn't ruin the dish. Pico was fresh and paired well with the potatoes o'brien.   The quick start was a traditional egg, bacon, toast and fruit dish. The eggs were exactly as ordered, over medium - just enough runny yolk to eat with half the 9 grain toast. The 9-grain was thick sliced and medium density paring perfectly with their awesome homemade jam (which was more like mashed berries with a little sweet - I wish they would bottle and sell that stuff because I would be all over that!). I always enjoy stealing everyone's fruit skewers, since no one likes melons except me. You get a quarter slice each of cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, and watermelon. This time I paired my QuickStart with a cup of BC granola, which was loaded with rolled oats, dates, golden raisins, apricots, flax seed, dried cranberries apple & chia seeds. Wished I had room for more, or could buy some for home. I loved that it held up its texture phenomenally in milk without getting soggy. I thought it was less in your face sweet than store bought granola and enjoyed the variety of detailed ingredients in it. So yum!  I bet it's awesome in their yogurt."}
{"text":"Wanted a tasty start to my busy work day at the convention center. This place was not only close by but packed when I arrived. I asked what the wait was for one and was quickly seated at the bar.  Their menu has all the American classics pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, and benes. I ordered a soy latte, the coffee infused waffles and the smoked salmon lox bene. The latte wasn't bad but nothing special, I kinda wished I had ordered a regular coffee after trying it. The waffle was interesting but sub-par in the end. It had a bitter coffee flavor, it wasn't over powering, nice and subtle. I think the generous helping of super sweet caramel sauce on top killed what could potentially be an amazing waffle. Maybe order the sauce on the side to control the sweetness and soggyness of your waffle. Next the bene, again I wasn't totally impressed with this dish either. The muffin seemed average and one of my eggs was way over cooked. The hollandaise was perfectly prepared though not overly exciting in flavors.  All in all a \"meh\" eating experience. My waitress did an okay job and my food came out in a timely matter.   What with other great places to grab breakfast in the downtown Phoenix area I don't think I'll be back.  P.s when preparing drinks with orange slices make sure your wait staff are wearing gloves/ using tongs. I caught a staffer (not my waitress) digging her whole ungloved hand in the orange container."}
{"text":"If you don't know how to poach an egg then please take down eggs Benedict from the menu! What a joke!"}
{"text":"I went to the kiosk and ordered their large Caramel Hazelnut Iced coffee and it was delicious. Not only that, the employee was extremely friendly and attentive. Will come back and try the food!"}
{"text":"Breakfast with my friends was made immensely better because of the food at BC! Affordable and delicious - the wait staff was also exceptional."}
{"text":"I am being very generous here. Came in with a group of 5 of us before a game at the arena, place was not busy. Server took an extra long time to come take our order. Food took forever to come out. Once I got my breakfast sandwich, the eggs on it were just about room temperature. This is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to food! I'm not at Mcdonlald's ordering a 99 cent breakfast sandwich. This is a 7 dollar sandwich and they had the audacity to serve it with cold eggs. I could tell something was amiss because our server did not bring our food to the table, the workers who did were in a tizzy...Is there poor management here? Not sure whats going on...I got my order back out within a couple minutes, and it was fresh, piping hot and quite good I must say.   As we waited for the bill, someone at our table gave our server an empty iced tea for a refill, it never made it back to the table, even after she brought us our bills. Before I left I went walking around to see if I could find our server to get my friends iced tea, I could see her talking with the other servers behind glass just yuking it up laughing, having a good ole' time. Did not get the tea. Wanted to like this place, probably won't return..."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food!  Pleasantly surprised at the low price tag as well!  Got a delicious breakfast plate with 2 eggs, multigrain wheat toast, bacon, fresh fruit, and a cup of oatmeal on the side for only $10.32!  Friendly staff, nice open ambiance with lots of natural light.  A little hard to find because it's on the second floor of CityScape, but totally worth the search.    Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Bad bad service.  Seems to be the trend at downtown eateries:  if you are a professionally dressed male the female waitstaff will cater to you. If not, you are on your own and may wait a good while for service.   Such is the case today. My female friend and I ( both professionally dressed as we are lawyers) met for lunch. Tables were full so we sat at the counter for about ten minutes without anyone acknowledging us or clearing the previous occupant's dirty dishes away.    The waitress was busy flirting with a couple of male customers. Although she saw us, she ignored us so we moved to another portion of the counter closer to where she was flirting.  We finally got some service after about another five minutes.   Food was ok.  And this isn't the first time I've been ignored at the counter in lieu of a male customer.  Silly me for going back. No mas."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!!!! Lean and green and a chai latte!!! No better way to start the day!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and I was extremely impressed. We had the granola bowl and the egg white omelette. Both were great. For around $11 the omelette meal was huge. It came with fruit, potatoes, and a big fluffy omelette stuffed with onions and bell peppers. The granola is perfect for a healthy lighter option that is still full of flavor. I'm here for business and eating out every meal and this place has been my favorite.  I came for a second time, it was that good. They actually let me substitute the side of potatoes for whatever I wanted. I got the small cup of granola instead. This place is great and very accommodating!"}
{"text":"I'm DONE!!  I used to love breakfast club.  Used too.  The last 3x I have been here I have left saying \"I will never come back here\".  This last time I meant it.  The food is good and the prices are a bargin for breakfast especially in such a great location.  It is the waitstaff that are horrible.  They NEVER smile, they are completely ANNOYED and \"put out\" if you ask even for a napkin.  The last time we complained to the manager who looks like an extra from \"Good Fellas\" and he could care less.  I am NEVER going back here."}
{"text":"This place rocks it.  The Breakfast Club was located conveniently next to my hotel, so we took advantage of their yummy eats daily. The menu offers creative + traditional breakfast/bruch choices plus fresh squeezed juices.   Day one I tried the Bird omlette which was turkey, avocado and herb cheese. The omlette was very fluffy and light and the turkey delicious. I didn't care for the cheese which was more like a sauce - it was way garlicky and overpowered everything else. My boss has the Lean + Mean which was egg whites + veggies - he said it was great.  Day two - the Turkey Benedict. Oh hell yes - possibly one of the greatest breakfasts I've had, ever. The poached eggs were done perfectly and again, their turkey is great. I love that you can sub extra fruit or toast for the potatoes everything comes with.  If you're in the area, this is a great way to start the day off right!"}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for a conference at the Phoenix Convention Center, and I came here two days in a row because it was the closest breakfast place that had food I wanted to eat.   The first day, I ordered the BC Signature French Toast, which had 3 pieces of toast with fresh berries, candied almonds and walnuts, and powdered sugar, with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The grapefruit juice was definitely freshly squeezed, because it was so sour! But good and fresh. The french toast wasn't anything spectacular I think, and it honestly didn't have much flavor. It was also very difficult to eat, because the berries and walnuts wouldn't fit on the fork easily with toast.  The second day, I ordered full stack pancake with chocolate chips inside and strawberries + whipped cream on top, and I got a pineapple juice. There were 3 pancakes, and, like the toast, they didn't have much flavor. The whipped cream and strawberries were pretty low on quantity. The whipped cream wasn't very thick and was very sweet, and it melted at a quick rate. The pineapple juice, unlike the grapefruit juice, was very sweet, and I was trying to see whether there was syrup in it. I'm not sure. But it didn't take very strongly of pineapple, and it was very yellow.  The service both days was pretty good though! The waiters and waitresses are friendly, and they come by occasionally to ask how everything is."}
{"text":"Ive been looking for a great breakfast place here in phoenix. Had their signature french toast and it was AMAZING. Loaded with berries and some nuts and powdered sugar. Staff was friendly enough but they were busy so they were always on the move. I would definitely go here again but I do want to go to their scottsdale location. I here great things..."}
{"text":"Five stars for Breakfast Club. This place had an incredible menu that I wish I could just try everything in one sitting. The service was great and quick, the food was terrific. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll stop back by to try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"It made me choose 1 star ...... 0 stars for service. If I could go negative stars I would . Sara our server was the Worst part of our experience. Food was over priced, service sucked . And Gino the manager from jersey shore had no interest in our complaints but only offered his apologies for them being busy. Took responsibility for short staffing the restaurant . ( NO EXCUSE) . No offer to comp and even walked away making a joke of the bad service . Being in the food industry, this is poor taste ."}
{"text":"So glad I picked this place for breakfast.. peoples reviews do really help.  Now every time I go to Phoenix I will most definitely have breakfast here every time !!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Grilled cheese is AWESOME! Benedict is DELICIOUS. I am definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Holy yum. Found this gem through Yelp and decided to try it last minute. I got the Lean and Green omelette with no alterations and it was DEVINE! 10/10 recommend this spot for taking people. Lovely atmosphere, staff and patio!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place for breakfast. Showed up midmorning, after a little bit of a struggle to park and find the place which is literally the only bad thing about the place. Food was spectacular, I ordered their take on biscuits and gravy which was great as well. Full coffee bar, and it's all reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Club. Downtown corporate, Gold Gym location, Cityscape.  Walking into the restaurant everything about it says Traditional American Diner, with the exception of the young friendly gals who all deserve the title hot stuff after their names. I am able to praise the unequaled attention on the interior design. Smart colors with clean, precise lines. Modern in style, with several large glass doors that open to any beautiful weather and an outdoor patio. I sit at the counter.  I am staring at a twenty thousand dollar Italian coffee machine for the professional with all the necessities next to it. This company is doing business with world class coffee artisans. Miscela d'Oro Coffee cup accessories are in the house. And most importantly, I learn the beans are purchased from Brazil and roasted in Italy. I order a quad before I learn they do a French Press, a disposable paper and plastic cup \"afeti√®re √† piston,\" which is a simple coffee brewing and filtering device that has evolved into a four dollar atomic strength coffee to go. You have to see it.  The menu has something for everyone. Breakfast http://thebreakfastclub.us/BCmenuPage1.pdf Lunch http://thebreakfastclub.us/BCmenuLunch.pdf  I decide to do a hearty, satisfying breakfast and order the Huevos Rancheros with refritos negros, smothered in pork green chili, lettuce, pepper jack cheese and pico de gallo. 9.95. It is prepared in a classic style.  When I read of this grand opening, I had to make the pilgrimage downtown to give it a go."}
{"text":"Stayed at Palomar so this place is super convenient. Food was awesome  with the freshest of fruits. Everything we ordered  could easily be shared. I hate to waste such good food but we couldn't take it with us. Rhiley was our server and was wonderful  Will be back tomorrow and will get the mimosas."}
{"text":"Not often 5 stars are given to a place like this. \"Matts Bug Breakfast\" now has competition. Good news for both... both places are on opposite sides of the main city area. Prices are between $-$$. I'm limited to what and how I can eat... therefore I had a few substitutions... they made it work at no extra charge. If one sticks with H2O you can be out the door on $11 including tip. For me must have coffee. Anyway, sat at counter greeted with smile by everyone. Seeing what was ordered and what came out of kitchen... EXCELLENT! Decent if not big portions for what's paid. Best part of all... food is very good. Being a diner junkie... I'm looking forward to coming back on a day of splurging. I would recommend the one of the specialty plates, Biscuits and gray, chicken fried chicken and  eggs, one of the eggs Benedict... I believe the place gets 3.5 stars as an average ... I call BS. 4+. The Breakfast Club will come off as trendy... look past it... and order. All types... here. Food is great!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I have had in a very long time.  The French toast was outstanding.  My eggs and ham, with potatoes was fantastic.  The server was amazing.  The price point was excellent.  The portions are more than enough to keep you filled until dinner.  All 7 of us had the same review, and everyone got something different."}
{"text":"Worst experience! Would give no stars but that is not an option! I came here with a coworker for lunch the waiter came right away to greet us we placed our order I order signature French toast and 2 eggs with cheese for my drink I went with coffee. When the coffee was delivered it was cold (Red flag 1)... So I informed my waiter and he brought me a new one. We informed him we only had an hour when he first took our order so he brought our check with the hot coffee correction to speed things along. My coworker notice her order was messed up from the ticket so she called him back to fix the order being placed for her (Red flag 2) I paid for my food once he took the ticket to correct for my coworker plus a tip (we had separate tickets)... When my food arrived my eggs were cold and no toppings accompanied my French Toast (why me?? Red Flag 3)?? I asked my waiter where the topping were he realized yet again that he placed the wrong order... But this time for me. So he stated that he could bring me toppings right out which he did do along with an additional ticket to charge for the topping?? (Flag 4... If it's your error and I tipped there should be no additional charge but okay i was going to pay because i needed the topppings)  THE FRUIT WAS MOLDED!!! (Red Flag 5-100) So at this point I'm late to return to work with cold MOLDED food the only thing the waiter came up with is I don't have to pay the additional ticket for toppings... DUH)!! So needless to say I'm STARVING after going to lunch with no food in my stomach and paid $15 smh never again!! Thank God I saw the mold or this post would have been about me catching food poisoning from here!! Be very careful here... If there toppings are MOLDED what else is MOLDED in that kitchen?? Be very careful! I will also post the pictures as well"}
{"text":"We came here twice in one weekend as we were in town for a conference. Two VERY different experiences...   Saturday Stephanie was our waitress and she was the best. Very attentive and exceeded expectations with her energy. We split a full order of pancakes w strawberries & whipped cream along with an amazing omelet called Green Chili Chicken. 5 star experience!!   Sunday though Jesse was our waiter and he only had about 3 tables but never refilled our water, only stopped by our table twice the whole time, & was very inefficient when he walked by us multiple times without stopping. Then brought us our check by laying it down- not even asking if we needed anything. We ordered The Bird and it was average. Low in flavor and needed hot sauce (but wasn't getting that from Jesse) and the French toast was good but not as great as the pancakes. 2-3 star experience.   This place is always busy so expect a 10-30 minute wait especially if you want to sit outside. They'll text you when your table is ready. Overall the ambience is great and the food is well priced and tasty. Sorry that we couldn't give it 5 stars after our 2nd dine in."}
{"text":"Good food but terrible service.  We came here because there's really nothing much going on in Phoenix on Sundays as far as food scene goes. It was 5 of us and most of our food was good. Non-alcoholic choices was very limited.  The hostess told us we can go get coffee etc. in that little take-out booth they have while we were waiting for a table. I went there trying to get water. There were 3 servers 3-5 feet away from me at the counter, nobody saw me for at least 1 minute. They were busy prepping drinks etc. Fine. Then I said \"excuse me\", nobody heard me. At some point one of the server was facing my direction but apparently her vision was focusing on this drink that she did not acknowledged me at all. After waiting for another minute, I yelled \"hello\" still nobody heard me. Either they need to hire more people to attend to the guest at the take out booth or they need servers with better hearing.  The coffee mug were stained with coffee marks, not sure if it was an old mug. Then when the server refilled out coffee, it spilled to the table. She said she will come back with a towel. Never came back. Wait to order food and the food to come is also longer than average.   Usually a restaurant who has a 4-star review is pretty solid. I wonder if I am spoiled with a higher restaurant service and food standard in New York. But I definitely will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place - come early or use check in on yelp - we came from airport & we only waited 10 minutes  to sit - good coffee - food was great ! Nicely placed between 2 city buildings -park in cityscape & go up elevator -they have Indoor & outdoor seating... we'll be back again"}
{"text":"A not so hidden gem in Downtown Phoenix.  BC Signature French toast was perfectly prepared with candied nuts and fresh fruit.  Also, shared the Border Bowl with my wife.  Chorizo, bacon, ham, sausage, green peppers jalape√±os, pork green chile and crispy hash browns topped with 3 eggs over easy.  Heavenly and bountiful with flavor.  Coffee was good, server - Nicholas was best in class.  Just don't see all of this in one place that often.  Highly recommend, be prepared to wait on the weekends.  It is worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at large portions. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for. Pretty much whatever you get will be good. They have the best breakfast burrito I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out, and this is hands down my favorite. The fresh squeezed juices are to-die for, and the omelets are delicious. They also give you the option to order a-la-carte, which is great if you aren't particularly hungry. The outside seating is really nice!"}
{"text":"Their mignon Benedict is utter perfection! They always keep busy with people dying for more of their amazing food!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Had the chicken omelet, flavor was not good.  Salsa on the omelet had to be from a can or jar.  Just didn't seem fresh.  Only thing I liked was there coffee, but who can mess up coffee?!  Not coming back again."}
{"text":"Food was good (Burrito was very good).  Service and atmosphere were ok.  Couldn't get a refill to save my life.  The starts are for the food."}
{"text":"This place was van unexpected treat! There is indoor & outdoor seating. We sat outdoors to enjoy the beautiful day! I ordered the chicken fried chicken! It was delicious & the chicken was not dry at all! My friend ordered the green chili chicken omelette & loved it! The portions are big but not overwhelming. Coffee was very good and smooth also..not acidic like some other coffee. Can't wait to go back to try their cold brew coffee!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this GEM in downtown Phoenix. Holy Cow!!! Menu is amazing. Lots of healthy and unhealthy options. I chose  Traditional eggs Benedict with a side of crispy bacon. Everything about this plate was spectacular. Canadian bacon, No fat. Not chewy. Grilled peppers and onions were super tasty. The server (Jenn from New Orleans) was the icing on the cake. Friendly, diligent, persistent and recommended what I believe was the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. I cannot wait to come back. This place is for everyone too! Indoor and outdoor seating. Keep up the amazing work."}
{"text":"I ordered the machaca scramble which came with rice and beans was sub par.. the rice tasted like it was reheated and didn't taste good and the biscuits were dry and the gravy wasn't good at all.. it still wasn't cooked threw and had a floury taste.. I wasn't impressed. I have been here twice and wasn't a fan, and tried to give it a chance but it wasn't meant to be!"}
{"text":"This was a cute place for breakfast brunch or lunch. We choose to dine outside in the laid back atmosphere. Waitress was on top of things. Must try the infused coffees, so good. I ordered the breakfast burrito, was big and tasty. My daughter ordered a salad which she was very happy with. My husband ordered the chicken fried chicken, was filling and very good. My son ordered the hog omelette which was filled with different breakfast meats,again no complaints there. Are plates minus the salad also came with potatoes as well as fresh fruit...bonus! We had to park about a block away, but was a fun environment to walk around in. Don't forget to get your parking ticket validated which will make parking fee."}
{"text":"Spending our staycation at the Westin Phoenix was within walking distance, so we saw this place and gave it a shot for breakfast on Saturday. The food was better than average, I really liked my Grilled Cheese breakfast sandwich, my fiancee really liked the french toast. The fresh-squeezed OJ and pineapple juice were really good too, but overpriced. Service was mostly competent and we had no complaints other than that the food was a little slow coming out. The order were correct the first time, and the waitress checked up on us frequently. We had a little bit of sticker shock, but the food was good enough to bring us back Sunday for breakfast again.   In general, we like this place, and we will be back when we are downtown around breakfast time, but likely won't go out of the way to go here.  PS: I know there were a lot of complaints about the service at the bar, and we knew that before we went to TBC, so we specifically chose to not sit at the bar, but I kept an eye on it. The bar remained packed even when the restaurant wasn't, and people seemed generally happy, so they may have fixed the bar service problem. I saw this on both days, so it wasn't just a fluke."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast.  Large menu with lots of healthy choices.  Several of their items are made in house. My husband had the bird omelet.  The turkey was very good as was the overall omelet.  I had the Huevos Rancheros which came on a Chipotle tortilla with a good amount of pork and black beans as well as black beans. Yum. We came with 4 other people who are pretty picky due to dietary restrictions and personal preferences.  Everybody found something they liked on the menu.  The mushroom omelet was quite good and our really picky eater had the fruit, granola and buckwheat pancake and was happy for a change. Lots of choices for sides at a reasonable price.  Service was good.  Only complaint is we went on a Sunday morning.  SO busy which resulted in our check being delivered shortly after our food came and we were all still eating.  I HATE that.  I'm pretty sure that is a management/training issue so I did not complain to the server.  I know they want to turn tables every 60 minutes or less but I personally do not want to see a check until after I have been given the courtesy to finish my meal.  I don't think that's a lot to ask for.  Will I go back? Absolutely.  The other negative is parking is difficult."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast downtown Phoenix and very reasonable. The huevos rancheros is my go to breakfast there. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing! Not a greasy spoon kinda place... I had hue is con masa and it was out of this world! Fried eggs on top of delicious cornbread with green chiles tomatoes and onion with a spicy sauce drizzled on top. Yum! It was served with fruit and potatoes which was perfect! Filling but you don't hate yourself after. The service was just as amazing. My waitress was friendly and made sure I had what I needed! Stop in you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So when we arrived, they didn't ask if we had a preference for inside or outside. The outside area didn't look like it was part of the restaurant, it looked like it was part of the kiosk. So we didn't even bother to say anything. After a 45 minute wait, they sat us outside and only then told us it would be even longer to wait for an inside table. Had we known, we would've gone somewhere else from the beginning. Service was minimal. Except for taking our order and bringing our food, they never came by to refill drinks or ask if we needed anything (tabasco, syrup, condiments, etc). My glass had a huge crack in it. The food was fine. Not fantastic, but not bad. If the food were amazing, I'd have put up with everything else, but it was just fine. I probably would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I was afraid this would be an overpriced, mediocre hotel restaurant since it's next to the Palomar. Fortunately, I was wrong and this place is worth a try for breakfast. We were able to sit outside and I enjoyed a giant iced coffee in the Phoenix sun along with some tasty, fresh oatmeal and some surprisingly tasty potatoes and bacon. Service was friendly (as it was everywhere in Phoenix) and this place is worth a try if you're in the area for breakfast if you aren't up for the walk to Matt's."}
{"text":"Only place we could find open for breakfast near the light rail...lucky find for us! Nice indoor/outdoor seating. Super friendly staff with quick service. I had their breakfast bowl with chirizo, eggs, hash browns and bacon. Really liked thier house sauce. Only negative was they only had Coke in bottles...just Coke...no other sodas."}
{"text":"Another placeholder so my pictures link. I'll update with details later, but the 3 star rating holds true."}
{"text":"After golds gym, we went straight across to this wonderful place call heaven. Haha. Their breakfast here was phenomenal. Can't go wrong by starting off with their OJ. YUMMMMMMM. Omgggg the french toast is a must. Three thick toast, the walnut was so tasty, it had fresh blueberries and strawberries on it.   It was simply heaven in your mouth. ALSO the veggie omelette was a out of this world,  with fresh fruits and potatoes on the side... Haha not complaining, it was wonderful.   I SHALL COME BACKKK"}
{"text":"Great place to go grab a bite of breakfast and people watch along with work if you need to.  Nice staff, great food and a pretty cool place to relax and enjoy fresh food.  They are very kind to make exceptions if you have allergies or food limitations.  Good place to stop by."}
{"text":"Every great experience starts with the staff. I don't feel guilty eating the food because it's all healthy and no wait like other popular breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:15, seated at 11:25 finally had a server at 11:40. The hostess was on a he rude side, I realize that my dining partner is high functioning Autistic and that might have been the reason for the rudeness. Our server was enthusiastic but definitely on the slow side. My first and last time here."}
{"text":"Out here for the dodger game, came to this place Saturday when we got here AND HAD TO COME BACK SUNDAY!!!! So good! Must must must must come here"}
{"text":"3rd time there in a week, if that doesn't explain our 5 stars I'm not sure what will. First time I had the eggs Benedict, last two trips I've had the border bowl. Bloody Mary wasn't my fav, but the mimosa was good today. My wife has ordered the biscuits and gravy all 3 trips. The wait usually isn't bad if you're ok with sitting outside. Service is great."}
{"text":"I would like to give it a 4.5 because my wife liked it so much. Her Quick Start Conscious was perfect and right up her alley. Egg whites, steamed broccoli and fruit. She added nine grain toast to finish it off. She loved it.   I created my own omelet with shaved turkey, feta, spinach and tomato. I probably mixed the wrong ingredients because it didn't go well together. It could have been good, but I should have just stuck with their omelettes. The service was very good as well. We may go back (tomorrow)."}
{"text":"I went here with the BF for breakfast the other day. It is conveniently located at Cityscape. I really liked the breakfast. I had the breakfast grilled cheese with eggs over medium. It was tasty! Eggs, hash browns, cheese, and really tasty crispy bacon on sourdough..... really extra delicious! The BF has biscuits and gravy and it was also very good! It had a roasted red pepper sauce on top of the gravy that was sweet and spicy. I wouldn't say this is the BEST place to get breakfast downtown, but it is very good and fairly inexpensive, so I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, large portions. Seating inside and out, fresh ingredients. We will visit again"}
{"text":"Went on friends recommendation.  Fast fresh and cooked to order.  Super friendly servers.  Prices are very reasonable. Absolutely nothing to complain about the Breakfast Club."}
{"text":"Great food and one of the best breakfasts I have had in a long time.  I had the eggs bene and not a single complaint!"}
{"text":"My first trip in here was for Easter brunch courtesy of my grandmother. This time there was a little issue with getting the attention of a staffer to be seated, but the food did not disappoint. Challah has to be one of my favorite breads, so seeing that their french toast was made with it just about had me dancing in my seat. I ordered two slices because I assumed they were going to be along the same lines as the huge, thick, and fluffy chocolate chip pancakes I had during Easter - I was right.  The slices were the size of my face so they more than filled my hungry stomach and the side of pork sausage and bacon was the cherry on top. I would definitely recommend Breakfast Club Cityscape to anyone who's looking for a good breakfast place downtown. They're open on the weekends, too! Next time I look forward to trying some of their lunch options - I think the grilled cheese is calling my name."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Friendly staff and the food was delicious.  We reserved online and was seated in about ten minutes.  We ordered  bacon and omelettes.  They have inside and outside seating. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"No wait, single seat left at the bar at 9 AM on a Monday. I wanted something healthy and a coffee, and that they delivered. They are located on the 2nd floor area of the Kimpton building, across from EOS Fitness entrance. Not labeled well, so look for doors with a \"BC\" on them.  They have boozey breakfast drinks, juices, coffee, tea and loads of breakfast food options. The kiosk in the middle of the outdoor area is for to-go items, but they do not have nearly as much, no breakfast food it seemed and just drinks. I initially asked the restaurant if I could order to-go, they sent me to the kiosk and I returned to just dine in.  Home run: -quick service and food at the bar -all my egg white omlet changes were correct, can get fruit in lieu of taters -hot sauces -bacon was quite tasty -mocha was delicious and not too huge  Meh: -kiosk only really has drinks and quickie lunch items. I can't figure out how to order breakfast to-go -would appreciate being able to switch any egg item for egg whites, but I'm not sure if that's possible  Props to the bartender that allowed me to go retrieve my wallet after I reliazed at the end that I didn't have it. He trusted me to return and pay, as I did. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"I agree with other Yelpers when they say that this place is a solid 3.5 stars. This weekend, we are in town and staying at the Hotel Palomar, which is a short walk to this restaurant. We woke up really early Saturday morning, due to the NCAA Championship Fan Center outside of our window blasting music at 6AM, and called downstairs to see where the best places for breakfast were in the area. She recommended the Breakfast Club since it had a variety of dishes and was a close walk. We decided to go here and had a decent experience. This place doesn't stick out to me and I don't think I would personally rush back here anytime soon (if I found myself back in the area). The portions were generous and the restaurant was large - both good things, considering there are plenty of seats and two people could share an entree.   FOOD: 3 stars. Very average, overall. I ordered a single blueberry pancake and he ordered the waffle with granola and fresh berries (which we split), as well as the Monster Burrito with both the chile and queso on the side. I think the waffle was the best item, followed by the pancake, and lastly the burrito. The waffle tasted pretty good, but I though that the granola and berries took away from the flavor of the waffle itself. If we were to order it again, I would opt for something lighter. The pancake was good and really big, but a little dry. The burrito was, in my opinion, terrible. We only took one bite each, and both decided it was dry and didn't taste that well. Definitely ask the server what they recommend because the waffle was really good!  SERVICE: 4 stars. The service was pretty good/average. Not outstanding but also not a bad thing to say about it.  LOCATION: 5 stars Conveniently located in a nice area of Downtown Phoenix. If you're staying in the Palomar or around there, it's out on the second floor level of restaurants and shops. Very spacious and a lot of room to sit!"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick, healthy breakfast and the friendly, highly competent staff recommended I combine a cup of Irish oatmeal and a cup of yogurt and granola.  It did not disappoint or make me wish I had ordered something more indulgent.  Oatmeal was delicious and the yogurt, granola and flaxseed cup was the perfect complement.  Oh, and awesome breakfast joint coffee.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food serbice was veru good i emjoyed my self.... I would highly Reccomend. I will stop again."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a breakfast expert and cocktail aficionado. I.e. I go out to breakfast a lot and maybe I like to drink too much. That being said, this place is wonderful. I'm sure service can lag when it gets slammed but I did not see that. I had eggs Benedict and the waffle with bananas foster on it and a Bloody Mary, mimosa and a screw driver. Don't judge me.    It's was all perfect or close to perfect. I didn't feel like I was in some chain restaurant like lazy dog. This was classy. Service was great. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had. The Benedict was perfect. I have eaten hundreds of benedicts in hundreds of restaurants and this was surely top 5. Indoor seating and outdoor patio. Clean. The women all wear yoga pants too so that's nice. The mimosa and screwdriver had fresh orange juice. If this place was in the Bay Area I would live here. One of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots of all time."}
{"text":"Breakfast Club redeemed my Phoenix experience.    The food was excellent but the service... oh, the service!  If the option presents itself, sit at the counter.  The two gentlemen who work behind the curved the counter are the epitome of efficiency.  Clearly they take pride in what they do and have honed their skills to the point that they (uncannily) are able to anticipate just about everything.  Thinking about a cup of coffee to go?  It appears on the counter with your check.  Contemplating a no carb breakfast, all options-- including possible substitutions-- are presented.  During my brief time in the restaurant, it was clear that everyone who worked at BC genuinely cared about their clientele.  A woman named Betty walked in and an iced tea was waiting along with an english muffin prepared specially for her.  Was it called in ahead of time?  Not according to Betty: \"they somehow know.\"  Just about everyone who entered the front door was greeted by name.    If you've ever wanted to experience what 'flow' in a restaurant looks like, the counter at Breakfast Club is your place.  Sit back and let the staff take care of the rest."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot! The servers are always friendly and the food is great. They are busy but always seem to get everyone seated quickly. The Border Bowl is a must try."}
{"text":"Flew into Phoenix headed to Sedona/Grand Canyon and we stopped in here for an early breakfast. It was easy to find and we all enjoyed the food. I had the breakfast grilled cheese with over easy egg and it was buttery, crispy & delicious."}
{"text":"We went to this establishment on 11/10 after an event at US Airways. It took us 10 minutes to get a table that was next to the hostess stand, that was like putting us next to the kitchen. It was a beautiful morning and there were tables available in the patio area. The waitress was not the nicest, we looked at the menu and nothing was appealing to us. We decided to have coffee and go somewhere else. We advised Sara, our waitress of this and wow did we get the crappiest attitude ever! She already had a crappy attitude and showed it can get even worse. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, NOT!! She said she will get us coffees to go, because they are busy and need the table. The coffee was good, but we will never recommend or go back there again."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and looking for a place for breakfast.  Looking up places nearby ant saw a couple of women and asked them where a good place for breakfast was.  The gave us directions that was a short block away.  We both enjoyed or meals with service, food, and friendliness of everyone outstanding.  The next day, we went out of our way to have breakfast there again and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This food was amazing! I had the tinga plate and it was all perfect. The waitress too she was very quick and kind. She actually chose my plate for me :) The establishment is right in the middle of City Scape and it was clean and very nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic catalina chicken sandwich, and honeys behind the counter and as diners, bonus."}
{"text":"Food was good service was horrible. Waitress didn't bring us most of our order and snapped at my mother when she asked for a glass if water after forgetting it 3 times. It's a shame that the service would stop us from coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the food is good, but not great.  Definitely solid breakfast and lunch food, but don't expect to be blown away.  The last time I went the server forgot to bring my lemonade, so he comp'd it, which I thought was really nice.  I do think it's a little odd that the hostess and female servers all wear yoga pants, like they just came over from Gold's Gym after their workout."}
{"text":"I loooooove breakfast and the atmosphere and food combined that TBC offers is one of a kind! I went on a weekend morning in October. Perfect weather, sat outside in the courtyard seating area of the restaurant. It was fairly crowded so the service was a little slow. We had to ask for things a couple times. The mimosas were expensive and not that great but the food is. Having a leisurely breakfast Downtown is something most of us don't get to do because of week-day work schedules, so I definitely recommend spending some time there if you get the chance. I had the Belgian waffle with strawberries and a side of bacon and my guy had a huge southwestern burrito. They were both terrific!"}
{"text":"Before we decided on the Breakfast Club, we had tried going to two very popular breakfast places in downtown Phoenix on a Sunday and had to give up because the places were packed!  But when we finally got our food at the Breakfast Club, all our doubts (and hunger) went away. My Huevos Rancheros was hearty and delicious. Service was also quick. We'll check this place out again the next time we're back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good solid breakfast, very busy which was a good sign, I had the quick start which was good, the potatoes o'brien were very good and everyone was talking about the buckwheat pancakes, I'll have to try next time."}
{"text":"I love the pancakes here and the ice tea. Great service. Too bad I can't give them more than 5 stars for the best pancakes I've had in any restaurant in Arizona!  When I was leaving I asked to have my parking violated which is a service that they provided in the past. The hostess said they ran out of stickers and I need to walk over to the gym and ask them to violate my parking. I asked to speak to the manager. He said this is something they do all the time. He offered to go with me. I was not happy. I did go to the gym and the nice young lady at the desk said ask if I was a member. She was nice to help me.   Breakfast Club should take better care of their customers!"}
{"text":"Decent food, not a terribly vegetarian friendly menu. Food wasn't bad, but nothing I'd venture to rave about. Good service and they serve a decent Americano.   I wouldn't go out of my way for a second visit, but if you're in the area, not a bad choice."}
{"text":"I came here for the UYE last weekend and we all had a good time. Monica O. didn't seem to bothered by them loosing her reservation and I arrived late so I guess I shouldn't complain but I have to subtract 1/2 star since it's just unprofessional. Also have to subtract 1/2 star more because they didn't have the huevos con masa which is my favorite dish at the Scottsdale location. Instead I tried the huevos rancheros. This was prepared pretty differently from how it is usually done at other restaurants. The pork green chilli and refried black beans were very, very tasty but for me the dish fell flat since it was served on a soft tortilla-ish wrap that wasn't even toasted or anything so I was really missing the crunch from the tostada shell that I was expecting. It was still pretty good food, though. But I doubt I will ever come here again since the Scottsdale location is easier to get to/park and has a better menu. Also, the decor here matched the Scottsdale location's post-remodel asthetic but lacked the same charm.  One note on their house made V-18 \"juice\" since I tried this for the first time. It really bears no resemblance to to V-8 juice. Think of it more like a vegetable smoothie or even a pureed gazpacho in a glass. I am not saying that's a bad thing, just be aware. I did finish it, but it took a while."}
{"text":"This place was packed for breakfast by 8:30am but they were able to accommodate us right away. I had the wrap and a dirty chai latte. The chai latte was delicious and the wrap was ok.   I wish they had more options without eggs so I could have enjoyed a breakfast option."}
{"text":"I want to start this by saying this is an establishment I frequent because of the quality of the food and have never experienced what I did today. It was so off that it warrants this review. In no way shape or form was what I experienced today acceptable in any establishment. I'm sharing this in the hopes that the management reviews since I didn't see a single manager present today.   Two of the three meals we ordered came out correct. The third one was incorrect and was immediately taken back to the kitchen. I was under the understanding it was being corrected. 15 minutes later, our server came to check on us. It was at that point we made her aware of what happened with the 3rd meal. It was apparent whomever delivered our food did not make her aware of what had happened.   About 5 minutes later, yes we are now 20 minutes into this debacle, she returns with the SAME plate of food that was originally brought out. She indicated that we could go ahead and keep that and they would remove the charge from the bill. Excuse me? I now have food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for (at least) 20 minutes. It was far from warm let alone fresh. I don't think I needs go into detail of what happens to eggs, fruit and toast that has sat this long under a lamp.   Needless to say, not a great visit. The visit overall would have been more than 1 star had it just involved the first part of the experience. But, at the point the waitress did what she did, the entire experience became that of epic proportions. Overall, extremely disappointing from a usually solid local restaurant experience."}
{"text":"This is the office go-to place when we're trying to soak up last night's libations. I mean, when we're hungry in the morning! Yeah, that's why.  BC has consistently staved off our morning appetites since I moved to the downtown office. I almost always get the breakfast grilled cheese, the BC sandwich or the Club Plate. All are great, but i must admit the grilled cheese in sinfully delicious.  I once showed the staff my bacon tattoo and I think they got a kick out of it."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my brother. Nice modern setting. They do serve alcohol. Had a fresh toast, it was heaven on earth. The butter was amazing, I even ate it on it's own with syrup. Friendly hipster waiters. The bowl was pork heaven. Eggs, pork,  sausage all perfectly cooked. Brother had the eggs biscuit and gravy. I think it was okay but my brother loved it. Different strokes..."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one Sunday while I was in town with a friend. There was a wait so I did call ahead seating; which the hostess told me would be fine as long as I got there within the hour. I got there earlier and my table was already given away and she told me it would be a 20 minute wait. We decided to wait but saw there were two seats at the bar so opted for that option. They don't do bottomless mimosas here for lunch but bottomless is not needed with these mimosas. I ordered the large and it was about a 4:1 ratio of champagne to orange juice; which is perfect in my opinion. I ordered the French toast which was a huge portion and topped off with fresh fruit and pecans. It was delicious and more than enough. It's located in the second floor of the building which is located in downtown Phoenix a block away from the stadium."}
{"text":"Amazing food with great service to go along with it.  I took my office staff there, and everyone was exceedingly happy with what they ordered.  I don't live in PHX, but will vist this place again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Have not had breakfast here but have tried several times to eat lunch there. At noon there has been a lot of people so I went somewhere else. Yesterday I was able to get there at 11:30 and sat at the counter. The waiter was extremely nice. The decor is what I would call modern or trendy. Clean. I was in the mood for a simple grill cheese sandwich. It is on Sourdough bread two kinds of cheese. Got a cup of Tomato Basil soup. Both was very good. I got Ice Tea which was kept full. Several checks to see if everything was OK. They are very worth a visit.  If I ever get in downtown at breakfast time I will probably give then a try. Remember To Eat Good Food."}
{"text":"Beautiful outside seating area.  Mimosas are wonderful portions are huge and the service was great!  Nicholas was our server and he's so much fun, and made great recommendations! This place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for the March breakfast UYE and I had a great time with about 15 other Yelpers.  Thanks Monica O. for organizing the event.    I had the Lean and Green Omelet with a side of bacon.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/breakfast-club-phoenix?select=uvj8DJyrCItJkV4E9AFqHg#m0Vvp-J0oR0j1UxusMrO3A  The egg-white omelet was very delicious with spinach, broccoli, bell pepper and onions on the inside.  I requested to hold the cheese on mine and I substitute that cholesterol with bacon!    The standout in this event, besides meeting new Yelpers, was the service.  For a party so large http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/breakfast-club-phoenix?select=uvj8DJyrCItJkV4E9AFqHg#c5bPyX-c--ABMMX-LNM0Mw , the service was pretty darned good if I do say so myself.  HA!  I just found out by reading someone else's review in the side bar that our reservation was lost.  I had no idea.  Maybe that explains why the server was so nice?  I'm not sure.  All in all, I was very happy with the service.  The great part about this resto is that it is located mere steps outside of the (I hate mentioning another business in a review) Palomar Hotel in the Phoenix City Scape.  You exit the backside of the hotel and you're right there at the restaurant.    The parking garage http://www.yelp.com/biz/standard-parking-phoenix-2#hrid:f7Y3tSYRFG3K-BJclN_5qg  below Cityscape is a convenient place to park.  You take the elevator up and exit near the restaurant's entrance.  Be sure to get your parking ticket validated by BC.  I would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"Typically love this place during the week.  On weekends apparently no one is paying attention.  Sat at a table right away but 15 minutes before anyone came to the table to get the order and the place is 75 percent empty.  Food is still the bomb but the service today was mediocre at best."}
