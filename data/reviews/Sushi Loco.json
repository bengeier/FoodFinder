{"text":"Worst. California rolls I've ever eaten. Wrong type of rice, they're the size of uncooked rice.I opened my Togo box and omg  smelled soooo fishy, the crab meat was all shredded not a chunk of crab and pieces of avocado were tiny. Texture of mush. There were no equal size proportions (ratio) tiny sliver of avocado ton of SHREDDED crab, very little rice. Did I mention the smell.... Really disappointing!"}
{"text":"I love this place !!! I moved from California 2 months ago and this is by far the best sushi spot in Phoenix. Customer service on point."}
{"text":"I'm not a big yelper, but from now on I will be.  I'm tired of going to places that have awful food.  I was here yesterday.  I ordered the Vegas roll, California roll, miso soup and the firecrackers.  The miso soup and the firecrackers were good.  The sushi, however, tasted as if they had been made 5 hours prior to ordering.  I love sushi, and in order for it to taste well it needs to be FRESH. Fresh is not a word I would use to describe this place.  I will stick to my normal place since I won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"Horrible Service... Great food. But thanks to the waitresses I will NEVER go back. (Short & Simple) I  don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this new sushi trend (Mexican Sushi) and I bet you will be to after visiting. Great A++ service. Food was super fresh, mouth watering and excellent as always. I enjoyed the sushi loco roll and a traditional roll."}
{"text":"I was with one other person at 1:30 in the afternoon and there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant as well. Yet it took ten minutes to be greeted by someone after being sat. We were warmly greeted and I asked if they had green tea and she did not know. So she asked and they did not. I asked for plain iced read, they only had raspberry from a fountain., Strike one. 
We then ordered our food and I did not see any kind of happy hour, not a big deal. So she takes our order then comes back to double check what we ordered, as she did not write it down. Throughout our eating she checked periodically which was good, but the service was slow and they all sat together right behind us and were eating. Not a problem, as a server I understand the eating on the job. However. It was the topic of their conversation that was bothersome. Talking about how \"ugly this fool was\" and being very unprofessional, swearing, the whole nine yards, and to top it, the manager was sitting and talking along with them! 
The place looked nice at first but then with closer inspection you could see that the shades were tattered, they did not give us chopsticks or dishes for soy, and they had Mexican music in the background? The food was okay but nothing to rave over. 
All in all I will not be back."}
{"text":"i just celebrated my birthday here on a friday night i reserved a table they made it look so nice with lots of bday ballons, i had the best time i will always remember my 29th birthday  food, music, and the workers were bomb.com i will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"The Seaweed salad was very tasty and had a good presentation. The sashimi 7pc was of good quality. Service was great! They even gave us a free shrimp tempura too!"}
{"text":"Saki is pretty expensive $20 for a full but it was good waitress said the owner has expensive taste and only buys the best, sushi was on point great atmosphere we did have to ask for plates and chopsticks he table wasn't set, beer glasses stayed cold for a while they were a little misleading they were stained beer glasses that looked like they frosted all the time"}
{"text":"I went in tonight with friends and family we were 7 in total. When we got there the hostess was very nice and friendly. Told us how many in the party and have us a very nice almost private table. Started ordering the food was just amazing no complaints at all. Since it was karaoke night we requested a song but being there for on hours or a bit longer we never got to sing. I did love that when it's someone's birthday they give them a slice of cheesecake with a bunch of candles. It was loud in there but I felt hurried by the waitress to get my order, and also to pay my bill. She was nice thought. My family they were complaining because she didn't clean the table of all the plates that we used."}
{"text":"The sushi was good! We had the sushi loco and the sweet and spicy crunchy roll. I recommend the sushi loco roll! The environment was upscale and they had live Mexican music (Norte√±a)."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! I was a little iffy because the last Mexican sushi place I went to wasn't so great but we decided to stop by since we live so close. It's very nice inside, a big change from the buffet that used to be there. I believe the waitress we had was named Isabella or something like that she was extremely nice and always seeing If we needed something. The food was great! We tried the spicy seafood soup, mango rolls, eel and spicy tuna. Didn't have a complaint about any of the food. The cook even made us cute little sculptures out of fruit. Definitely would go back! It's a little pricey but I'd say it's worth it."}
{"text":"The service is horrible!! Our server was a trainee with no trainer who took to long with our drinks and he never answered my question about if they had draft beer or not. Sushi was good, but not good enough to come back.. Especially because they lack of draft beer! I recomend Sushi 101 or SakeBomber Sushi and Grill."}
{"text":"Really really good sushi!!! I fell in love with the cordon blue roll(which isn't typical sushi). Also had the sweet and spicy crunch roll which was good. The vaquero roll was really good too! And probably the best orange chicken and fried rice in the valley. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! It was my first time trying this place and I was really looking forward to it. We were a party of 4 adults and 2 children, we placed our orders and waited....and waited. It took them almost an hour to bring is our food! I'm lucky they don't make their own beer or I would of waited an hour for that too. We went on a Saturday and it wasn't empty but certainly not busy enough to have our food take so long. The music was questionable, they had a what looked like to be a family singing karaoke & DJ'ing, I was only ok with the little girl doing her best Selena impersonation. We asked to speak with the supervisor who took so long that we had to double check with our waitress to make sure she had let her supervisor know we wanted to see her. When the supervisor finally showed up she didn't even tell us her name or apologize! It seems their staff doesn't get proper training. We were given a discount and gift card which almost made our whole meal there free but the damage was done. The service sucks so bad we wont be coming back. Really disappointing because they have a good Yelp rating, either their staff and families are on here 5 starring the place or other customers are lucky because if you read their reviews a lot of people have had issues with their staff and horrible service, gracias for nada."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever!! Completely ruined sushi for me and i love sushi didn't even have spicy yellowtail roll but they had a fucking carne asada roll!?!?! Smh awful experience I'll never return"}
{"text":"Great decor and fun bar ambiance. Tip: Wednesday and Thursday is Ladies' Night, $2 margaritas. They play really current Spanish pop music. Karaoke night would be fun. Most of the servers are Spanish speaking. The fusion tostada with sushi ingredients looked interesting.

I carried out California rolls. The sushi rice was mushy and the avocado was hard, on the green side. The other ingredients tasted fine. We loved the spicy mayo sauce. When I asked which day the fish arrived, the server did not know. After checking around, she came back with Friday. I definitely would come back to Sushi Loco for margaritas and a chance to practice my Spanish. I wouldn't mind trying the fusion dishes, but I was not impressed with their California roll."}
{"text":"I need to come back. This restaurant is located in the not so good part of Indian School Road. At night this place isn't where you want to be alone. With that said, this place has the best sushi nearby. I went there when it wasn't too busy, however it took more than 45 minutes to get my order. I ordered a miso soup, a specialty roll and 3 pieces of tuna sushi. While I was waiting I've noticed that the AC may have been set too high. I started to get sweaty in the warm area. The miso soup I got at around 10 minutes wasn't really that good. However when I got my sushi roll my mind changed. I don't really eat sushi that much so I can't compare between an elegant Sushi to a common sushi. I was surprised that the waitress did came back and was very apologetic towards the long wait. So even though it took 45 minutes to get my food and it was hot while I was waiting, I was given the benefit of the doubt and will return when it's a little bit busier and to see how well they do. Until then I'm going to give this place a 3 star review just because the food made me reconsider coming back."}
{"text":"This place has a vibrant fun atmosphere with great food- Latin flavor sushi is very good!"}
{"text":"I been to this restaurant like a million times. I have every intention to return a million more. 

You'd think it be weird--Sushi and Mexican, weird right?--but the reality is a lethal dose of amazing that will have you coming back for more. The Cielo, Mar, y Tierra roll is the greatest thing ever, It really is. It probably isn't sushi anymore, but you won't care. Also, those Shrimp Tacos are amazing. 

The venue has live music and it is generally amazing. Have not had a bad night there. It is ghetto, but then again, so is this writer. 

Already planning on going back."}
{"text":"This place has great food, looks sort of clean, and a nice ambiance. The food has always tasted great! Although the service is horrible absolutely horrible. The waitresses are rude and will talk back to you if they do not agree. When asked to speak to the manager they say the manager is not in sight. Well I am writing this review as I am sitting here ordering and I person comes in personally came in to put a complaint and the host came and told our waitress in front of us that when someone comes in and ask to speak to the manager you always say they are not around. And the manager was right in front of us! The waitresses need to be more respectful.. other than that the food is great this place can really be something special if you have the right costumer service"}
{"text":"Unassuming on the outside but truly gorgeous interior. Very nice fairly full horseshoe bar, great sound system, stage and dance floor. I suspect this place is fun on weekends with karaoke, dj's and Latin bands. The food is very interesting. I love my nice (traditional?) sashimi and California rolls but Sushi Loco has Mexican Sushi Fusion and it is very good! The chef is Asian and speaks Spanish- but not English, haha. And I think they are onto something. Not sure if this is a chain place but- I had a carni asata/avocado roll that was deep fried and garnished with shredded carrots. It was excellent. My girlfriend had a roll that was also excellent. We shared 'hot crackers' that was jalape√±o halves filled with cheese mix and deep fried- amazing. Interesting place, sushi lovers you need to give this place a try. Happy hour is 1-4pm and the rolls are only $8 each at this time"}
{"text":"We had the carne asada and cordon blue sushi rolls. They were awesome! The toritos, Mexican Roll, and Sinaloa Roll were awesome too! Sushi Loco had a good ambiance, Mexican music selection as well as people singing karaoke. A Phoenix must do dining experience. I recommend all to try this Mexican-Japanese fusion explosion."}
{"text":"This place gets pack after 9pm, a little too Mexican for my style but it's fine for their clients . Servers are fast and friendly . The owners are always there helping with the service . Prices are affordable . Food is delicious !"}
{"text":"This place was awful don't waste your time. When we first walked in the place was dirty and the front counter had food one of the employees ate and left there. When we were sat the both smelled like pee really bad. The waitress didn't bring us any silverware or plates or straws. She never came back for refills either. The sushi was not made right ordered a Vegas roll they did not include the salmon or the cream cheeses. The waitresss took forever to come back so we could get the things we were missing she didn't apologize for not bringing them and over charged us at the end. Terrible place it's not clean, smells, service is bad and the food is not good either"}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place. My family and I were so excited that there was another sushi joint opening close by but we were very disappointed. The sushi rolls were literally just rolls of rice with barely anything inside of them, the soda was awful and we had multiple different ones for the same reason and ended up drinking horchata which was awful as well. Our waitress checked on us twice, we had to catch her attention multiple times to let her know we were not enjoying our soda. I refuse to go back.. The soy sauce bottles were very dirty and almost empty, we were disgusted by the fact that we had to hold the bottles of soy sauce. Awful service and our waitress was snobby. We usual lent aren't very picky but this place crossed the line."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite sushi restaurant. Very friendly employees and fun atmosphere. I love the sushi but I usually come here for those delicious waffle fries."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. Terrible service, terrible music blasting for all to hear (mariachi music), the employees and manager literally sat behind us just talking about ppl and cussing up a storm, rude and lazy server (she didn't even know if they had tea or not), left us hanging to sit behind us and eat, dirty soy sauce bottles, the sushi was not made to the hype and the price (nothing like a sushi brokers made sushi roll, too expensive. Sucks to say, because it used to be an alright place 10 years ago. It was basically the same type of food, but it was more gourmet/make it in front of you/buffet."}
{"text":"The service and food was excellent, it's hard to find a good sushi place in town but this place is great, I would give it five stars but the whole parking lot was filled with trash and looked terrible from the outside but the interior is very nice."}
{"text":"So I'm a person who loves sushi. I love all kinds and I'm constantly on the search for a place that's affordable and tasty and this place definitely did that for me. The food was great and the service was even better. I don't see myself looking for anywhere new in the near future and i strongly suggest you guys come and try out this place. Atmosphere is fun and staff is attentive and friendly. A plus hands down :)"}
{"text":"Food is DELICIOUS, especially Carne Asada roll & Cielo mar y tierra roll. Environment is really chill. Only thing is that they take really long to get you seated & waitresses are a bit rude & care-less but when your having a blast there you don't even realize that the service isn't the best. The live music is absolutely amazing my 2 favorite bands i've seen perform there were Alarma music & Alto Control. Really recommend those bands. I've been here a couple times & would still keep going."}
{"text":"The only sushi place close by to me at the moment. And when I say sushi, I use that term lightly. I don't know what the trend is in Phoenix Arizona with Mexican sushi, but it is not really sushi. I really like the ambience of the eating room, colorful and dark with decent service. I wanted something with Eel (my favorite)...the roll I chose, the waiter told me was not that good. What? I've learned to not question the staff regarding seafood, if they say it's not good, I will go with them. I've been asked for other eel roll suggestions. He said they had nothing else. Looking at the menu they had several things. I went ahead and ordered the Catapillar roll which I did have eel on it. The eel tasted like bananas for some weird reason, and the $13 roll was mostly made up of rice.I also ordered the calamari off of the appetizer menu. I was surprised when the calamari arrived shaped like fish sticks. I had to ask specifically for wasabi when my roll arrived without it. Doesn't normally come with rolls? This place will do in a sushi pinch, but look elsewhere elsewhere for decent or authentic sushi in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Upon entering, I was blown away by the size of the interior. This is a Mexican sushi restaurant and bar with a diverse menu offering sushi, seafood, and  Asian fusion. 
We were greeted by Tiffany and although it was 12:30, it was empty. I was a bit worried upon seeing this at lunch time. We were seated at a window booth; the lighting was dim with a decorative, hanging light ball above each table. Great vibe and ambiance. We ordered the \"Firecrackers\" a delicious appetizer. It's a jalape√±o pepper with a light tempura batter on the backside and deep fried, stuffed with a cream cheese & crab filling, served on a plate of fresh spinach and thin strands of carrots, topped with a delicious chipotle and eel sauce. Our entree was the \"Rock and Roll\" sushi roll- crab, cream cheese, avocado with a tempura battered shrimp at the front and end, topped with a sweet and spicy sauce. We requested more chipotle and eel sauce- this tasted like a teriyaki sauce- both were so good. Everything was fresh and our food arrived promptly. Tiffany was very attentive and returned several time to check on us. The food was delicious and nicely priced. I definitely will return."}
{"text":"One of my step daughters only gets sushi when she's with us so we decided to get sushi for New year's Eve even though my other step daughter hasn't yet become adventurous enough to try it.

This is a Mexican Sushi infusion restaurant and the flavor combinations are amazing.

I got the Sinaloa Roll, Dragon Roll, and the Volcano Roll. They were all amazing! Every bite was mouth watering. We will absolutely be returning to this place.

We liked Senor Sushi but the food was even better at Sushi Loco and the atmosphere was a little more laid back."}
{"text":"Super bad service , but food is great. We arrived , and took 10 mins for a server to get to our table.  When they arrived , they asked what we Would like for drinks, but yet no menus were yet given to us! Server brought menus , and after getting our drinks. Asked if we were ready to order food? How could we order, if we just got our menus.  We saw 3 other couples arrive there after us, and they received their food before us.  Like I said, bad service, but food is good.  I've been there on weekends with live bands, and place is great to have a great time with cocktails, but food service unfortunately needs a lot of work! Come here only for great music on weekend!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Food is meh. Soda was awful. Horchata sucks. Michelada is bad. Won't go back there. Little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Well I came here for a birthday gathering, staff was nice. Band was bomb! Karaoke was fun!!! Drinks were good, over all a good time. Salsa was bomb! Had spicy crab rolls, they were good also. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"this place was nice, but had lots of roaches and their customer service was bad ,. the cashier in the front counter was rude and made us wait 20 min till we could have a seat and it wasn't even packed ,,.,i tried the aguachile that wasn't an actual aguachile . i will definitely won't come back ..,,,,,,,,,,"}
{"text":"Ok. This is one of the zaniest fusion places in existence... talk about a clash of cultures. The mexican music is in the background... there is mexican karaoke three nights a week and the hot little mexican waitstaff overflows friendliness and service. 
On to the food...
The rolls are made by asian appearing chefs.. we were crazy curious about the carne asada roll. It did not disapoint. The meat and rice blended well all flavorfull and fresh. 
The mexico roll needed the fresh jalepenos I added. It was tasty and was a winner. 
Both of these rolls were breaded and fried. A sort of japanese chile relleno. 
For great service and something totally different give this place a try..."}
{"text":"Probably the worst phone order I've ever experienced. Ordered the rolls, no problem. Just 4 basic rolls. I show up at the time they tell me it will be ready. Aside from being blatantly ignored when I walked in, and then cut in line by TWO large families, they looked at me like I was speaking another language when I said \"I'm here to pick up a phone order.\" I got passed off to four different employees, who looked equally baffled and walked through half the restaurant before finally getting my food. The sushi was good so that's a slight plus, terrible customer service though."}
{"text":"I had great service here. The atmosphere is fun. I love love love the sushi here! Never thought I could have a cordon Bleu in a roll! Mmmm!!"}
{"text":"Ceviche was perfect, chiles toritos, and the michelada were awesome too. Prices are a little bight but worth it. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO STARS I would!! Horrible place! The service is just horrible. The waitresses are rude and take forever to come back to the table, they don't apologize for anything. They forget to bring you silverware and plates and at the end except a big tip. I came here for my birthday and it was the worst experience ever! And at the end they try overcharging you so always make sure you check. Just don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"4 starts because the music rocks ! Who knew Mexican sushi and Mexican music would end in such a fun night. The bacon wrapped shrimp is amazing. I could have ate the entire thing. It's a party restaurant and I liked it. Met the owner and he was such a character. I would go again and dance again"}
