{"text":"Seems like this place is deteriorating by the day..Been going here for almost 8 yrs. and it does not flare like it did back then. It was always great for 50% on Friday and Saturday. 

But just recently changing it to 30% off on the same days does not attract to me seems like a bad business advertisement. Plus the workers seems like they do not care anymore neither does the boss it seems. .

If you want cheap go here, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"Try super white tuna sushi. 
Here is best place ever. 
Also the price is better than other place. 
You can enjoy drinking and food."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place. The service is great and I've always been taken care of very well. The only reason for 4 stars is that it's a small place and tends to get packed and have long waiting lines."}
{"text":"Kobe has redeemed itself!!!  Attentive service from hostess, wait staff and sushi chefs!  Fantastic sushi as always. Best poki salad in town and truly the best fish and rolls. So glad we came in tonight (Friday night) for happy hour. Delicious! So happy Kobe is back in action!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! new low in a sushi experience

Boring rolls, we had to wait for 15 min for someone to \"explain\" how to order.....with only 1 customer in the place. Sushi pricing wasn't bad but $14 a glass for plum wine? When a bottle was little more than 2 glasses?
Not first time ordering plum wine, but last time I'll be going to Kobe"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and have to say ok! I have had this place before, but tonight was ok. Way to much rice and felt rushed. Love the mussels and there food, but not that much tonight."}
{"text":"I love this AYCE sushi. My girlfriend loves the decor. Fish is fresh. Great choices for beer and sake."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me I ordered yakisoba steak, and fried rice. It was ok tasting, very oily, but the yakisoba cost 10.95 and it was a child size portion, pitiful, and they charged extra to put mini pieces of broccoli, and I mean mini. The yakisoba does not come with rice, they charge you for a side order, anyway I dooooooo not recommend this place also I think I had about 7 small pieces of steak in my yakisoba. Don't spend your money. Never again."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back here if they paid me! Filthy dirty and slow, rude service.

The first time I went, it was for the lunch AYCE and our sushi chef (Carlos) couldn't make a sushi roll--the rolls were loose and every single roll fell apart. 

We decided to give it another shot for dinner tonight. I can honestly say that I have Never had such a bad experience as I did tonight at any other sushi restaurant. It took us 15 minutes to get an order form, but yet the couple that came in 10 minutes after us were given their order form when they were seated. Then it was another 30 minutes to get two of our rolls. Our third roll came pretty quickly.After more than an hour at the restaurant and while still waiting for our 4th roll, I looked up at the tv behind the sushi bar to see more dust on the tv and dvd than I'd ever seen in a restaurant. HUGE dust bunnies. HUGE. Of course, then I started noticing on how filthy the prep area was. We asked for our check and got out of there. $53 for 3 sushi rolls, seaweed salad and miso soup. I would gladly pay that price if the waitress had been nicer, if the sushi chef had acknowledged our presence, if the place were clean, and the sushi chef and waitress wouldn't have been giving each other attitude in front of us. It may be an AYCE sushi bar, but it took an hour to get 3 rolls--they hadn't even started our fourth roll when we decided to leave.

I can honestly say I will never go back, nor would I allow my dog to eat here.

blah!"}
{"text":"First time at this location, use to love going to the one on Rainbow & 215. It closed its doors. Good selection for AYCE, it was delicious. Being a Saturday it wasn't super busy but they only had one waitress who was also the hostess and a buser. The buser was so attentive, more so than waitress. 4 stars because of him and sushi was good. 
Over all would go back. Good food, good price."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh sushi. Love the all u can eat. Chef n staff are super nice! Great prices!"}
{"text":"Took myself to sushi after a really rough week, and decided to try Kobe. Really friendly staff and delicious sushi. I had the Apache roll and the Hawaiian roll and both were great! Will be returning again soon. Thank you Kobe"}
{"text":"Still coming back every chance I get.  Try the Ryan Patrick roll and I Miss You roll.  Wet Dream is good too"}
{"text":"Long time customer. It's a friendly environment with great specials. I would definitely recommend it. $9.99 lunch special."}
{"text":"Food was great, just like home. Grandma said miso was good too, better than most places. Thank you"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour. Sushi was good except everything baked was on tinfoil and was stuck to tinfoil so by the time you got it off it was a mess. Service was really good and they were very informative. We will be back but no backed rolls for us."}
{"text":"Wretched service.  They kept our glasses filled, and the food was great.  But we were clearly not regulars. The place was full \"regulars\" and the would get 2 orders in the time it took us to get one.  I have eaten at MANY all you can eat sushi and NONE have taken 3 hours for 3 orders.  It was absolutely ridiculous. I was furious."}
{"text":"This place smells. Against my better judgment we actually sat down and ate here. Maybe my standards are too high I cannot believe that anybody would give this place a good review. My boyfriend got sick after eating here. There's nothing worse than bad sushi."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time in years - wooed in by a special 50 percent off the entire menu (drinks, too!) offer that applies on Friday & Saturday nights. Our goal was to eat pretty \"clean\" after a week of indulgent dining! Nothing fried. No yum yum sauce. Etc.We started with a sashimi salad and some nigiri and dug into some simple rolls w/the only adornment being some garlic sauce on the side.   For 50 percent off, we'd give it a four. The service was a five. My husband, who is more of an expert than I am, said the quality of the fish was a little better than average, but the \"fills\" were outstanding.  It's also close to home, which is a bonus. We'd go back.  I also noticed they have a great lunch menu."}
{"text":"The fish was great and in generous portions. Love the happy hour (went on Saturday night). Sometimes takes a little while for the waitress to get to you, but they are great at filling drinks as soon as you finish them and bringing me extra extra ginger! ;) Definitely recommend. Also, the music was literally the most enjoyable from any restaurant I've ever dined in. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This is one of the main places we go to because my significant other likes that the Korean-style short ribs that are included in AYCE. They do include a very good variety of cooked food, including American dishes (I think I saw burgers and fried chicken on the menu). I do not recommend the chicken teriyaki lunch - the sauce is watery and chicken was forgettable. For AYCE sushi I would usually go to other places. But since they have a good selection, Kobe is a good place to dine to please people who have different tastes."}
{"text":"My favorite go to sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been dining at Kobe since they first opened many years ago, and we've introduced the restaurant to many friends and relatives. Consistently great food, excellent service and easy access. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The owner Brian is a tool.  I've order to go in the past few months and they screw up my order 3 out of 5 times.  I've complained and they won't fix the problem that they made.  I won't even recommend to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Went here with my cousin for happy hour and he told me that he didn't like this place because they charged him $4 for tip automatically when he previously went here. I had gone here before but my other cousin paid for the bill so i didn't know if they really did charge that or not. We decided to give it a try. Food was ok, nothing special. service was good though. When we paid for the bill, we had it split $25 each. I saw on the receipt that my card was charged $25. I left a tip of $6 in cash(I put $0 on the receipt)for the whole bill. When I got home my cousin told me to check my account because they had charged him $30 and not the $25 we had on our receipts. I checked my account and it was the same for me, I got charged $30. So all in all, we ended up leaving a tip of $16 for a $50 meal. I called and asked, they said they'd take care of it,  BUT nothing happened. I don't ever plan on coming here again. Nor will i recommend it to anyone either. If I could put a negative star I would."}
{"text":"Just ate at Kobe Sushi for the first time. $9.99 lunch special was perfect. All fish was quality and super tasty. I have been looking for a new sushi spot and I have found it. If you haven't yet...GO!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I love there happy hour and the all you can eat deals.
My favorites are J Roll, Red Rock, and Dragon roll. Their service is a little slow.... But if you sit at the bar instead of the table you are for sure to get your food faster as well better accuracy in your order."}
{"text":"They are not consistent with the freshness of the meats. I've had better but for the price I guess you can't complain. I'll come back as a last minute sushi spot last on my list."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Kobe's for over 4 years. The food has always been great. The place is always clean and the staff is friendly. Friday and Saturday nights are the best for great deals! Give it a try."}
{"text":"We went to this place, where it is advertise 50% off of sushi on Friday + Saturday. Well you actually are not saving 50%b/c they are way over price on the regular menu compare to other restaurants. 
We have been eating sushi for over 15yrs. We know a thing or two about quality sushi. 

We decided to try the all you can eat. 
Like most places the time limit is 1Hr. They do not really enforce that I think at most places unless they are extremely busy. 

IF YOU WANT TO FILL UP FASTER THEN EAT HERE FISH ARE THINNNLY SLICE AND RICE ABOUT 2 INCHES THICK ( well DON'T EAT HERE but somewhere more reasonably price), . 
The all you can eat menu is very limited selection of rolls you can choose from. 

None the less, from the time we order our first couple of order. It took them 20 mins before we got our 1st plate of sushi. And it didn't even have all that we order so about 5/10 mins later we order some more before we finish so we would not be waiting another 20mins. 
It again took about 15mins to get 2 rolls we order. Now almost an hour has gone by. 
We are still waiting on some of the item from the 1st order. These are the \"limited quantity items\" Like Uni, sweet shrimp, giant clam. 
You can only order 1 order per person due to the cost of these items. 

We then told the waitress that we are still waiting for those item and her response was \" you still want those items\" YEAH, seems like they try to fill you up on everything else, then you might not eat those expensive items. We said \"that's the first thing we order, we want it.\" another 10/15mins. 

We left pretty UN happy. The only decent thing was they had \"mochi\" as most other all you can eat only have ice creams."}
{"text":"Valentines day!!! Not worth my $25.99
Service was okay at first, but on the later part our Filipina server was trying to kick us out as soon as we paid the bill. Very rude to paying customers...we work in the hospitality industry and thats not how it works..
Not worth to give that $15 tip...
I will never ever go back to this place again..."}
{"text":"My daughter claims it was an off night but service was bad.  Didn't get what we ordered. The mochi tasted freezer burnt.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Ever since I experienced the lunch special I am a regular. This is great value -- an app and 2 rolls for $10 plus a great iced green tea. Grand canyon roll is like candy for adults -- the sauce is amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is great!!  The sashimi on the nigiri is way bigger then most places. All the rolls we had were fantastic. I liked the Japanese lasagna and the dragon roll. Friendly fast courteous service. Clean and not too noisy. I'll go there again!  In a heartbeat"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Kobe Sushi Bar on a regular basis for quiet sometime now. I love that it's in a convenient location, quiet/relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff, & great lunch specials. Let's not forget to mention that the sushi gets an A+! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite but the last few times I have been in it taste stale.. hope they makes some changes and go back to how great they used to be!!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi place I have EVER been to. I paid $25.00 for all you can eat I only ate 1 and a half sushi rolls. I AM A BIG FAN OF SUSHI and that place seriously my first and LAST time I will ever go there. I ordered a baked salmon roll & I have had other baked salmon rolls but this one was seriously nasty. The rice was hard that it felt like I was gonna break a tooth. And then I got a spicy tuna roll and it was really disgusting that I was gagging Every time I took a bite, I had some of my family members try the roll to see of it was just me with the taste. Nope that wasn't it. They all said it had a nasty taste. And then supposedly we ordered 80 pieces of baked muscles when we ordered only wanted 10. HOW DO YOU GET 80 from 10. Seriously horrible very very very very very horrible"}
{"text":"Went here with a Restaurant.com Certificate last Thursday. This place is pretty average for sushi. There are definitely better in town. Miso is good, could give you more Edamame for $4. Had some Tuna and Salmon Nigiri, Spicy Scallop, which were average. Had the Dynamite which was delicious. Red Rock roll was eh. 

I would not really go here without the certificate, but they do have a half off on Friday and Saturday during dinner hours, which keeps the food fresh and at a great price. It is worth going then even with no certificate."}
{"text":"GO HERE ON FRIDAY/SATURDAY NIGHT.  It's the only time it's worth it, and boy, is it worth it.

Happy hour is insane. What always amazes me is how few people, respectively, pile into this place for the great deals. Cuz it's not just the sushi that's half of: THE BOOZE IS TOO!!!

And then the sushi. Here's where it gets a little tricky. The hand-cut rolls are great. Not everything on the menu is half-off, and deciding what you want can take a while. My advice: order everything at once. They're going to bring it out to you intermittently, so you'll have time to enjoy each item. That's the way to do it anyway. The service here isn't stellar, but who cares once the J-roll comes around.


J-ROLL!!!!! It's baked, it's covered in eel sauce, and yet they still call it sushi. Thank god they do, or else I wouldn't love sushi as much as I do. Once you put a piece of J-roll in your mouth, your taste buds start to dance. I can, and have, eaten three of these in one sitting. I wasn't able to move for a while after it, but it was totally worth it. They have another version, called the B-roll, but it's like the younger, less attractive sister that everyone orders at least once out of pity.

In short: FRI or SAT. Order J-ROLL. BOOZE=CHEAP.

Awesome."}
{"text":"After ordering a few rolls, and trying to make the best of a bad situation, I finally had enough. The tuna was dark colored smelled/tasted very fishy, the avocado was browning, the sushi rice was too wet, the salmon was mushy, and the cream cheese was curdling. The tuna alone is enough to quite literally make someone sick. This establishment should not be selling food that is obviously expired. This is the fault of the sushi chef for not taking mind to the food. 

I will not be returning here. Even after letting the chef and our waitress know they still charged us. I can feel my stomach rumbling from the disgusting tuna."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Do not waste your time and money here. My family and I went here last night, and it took more than an hour to get our food. Place smells really bad too. Never again. I would give a zero star."}
{"text":"We come here about once a week and never had a bad experience. I don't understand people giving 2 star reviews...Service 5 stars, food 5 stars, prices 5 stars! Don't listen to haters and check this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get sushi! Clean environment and friendly staff. The burning Arizona is the best roll ever!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot. I come here at least once a month, whether it's just me or with my family! Everybody really enjoys the sushi! Service is great, food is great, they recently updated their interior design... Looks great!"}
{"text":"If you care more about the cost than the quality....come here.

The three times I have dined here have all been consistently disappointing.  

How can a sushi restaurant that doesn't stay busy afford to keep fresh fish on hand?   IT CAN'T!

The quality of tthe sushi here is below average, and many of their rolls are drowned in sauce.  It is safe to consume raw seafood if it is of the highest quality, fresh, and stored correctly.  Just because sushi is discounted, doesn't mean you should eat it.  Generally speaking, when sushi is swimming in a sauce bath, the chef wants to hide something, usually the quality of the fish.  This is one saucy place. 

Would you go to a discount heart surgeon?  Don't gamble with your health, play it safe, and avoid avoid avoid."}
{"text":"Is there any way to put 0 stars ?!?

It was great to have an all you can eat sushi spot right down the street from home until we were having lunch and got an uninvited visitor to our table (cockroach). Needless to say we got up and left. Still was charged and the \"manager\" that was going to call me back never did. So yeah.... Never again."}
{"text":"I love the sushi here when it is fresh, a couple of times it wasn't.  Staff is god, but when the early dinner crowd gets there it takes forever to get your order.  The one thing that really bugs me is that when  restaurant takes time to decorate their place and make it feel welcoming, it needs to extend to the bathroom.  the bathroom is clean but the picture on the wall still has a half torn price tag from Ross on it.  Really bugs me!!  Take pride in every room!!"}
{"text":"I love kobe...they have an excellent menu with lots of fresh choices.....my son and i love their 2 sushi roll and one appetizer special...great value....and the sushi man who creates our meal is fantastic......dmo"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and I absolutely love it here. The service, the food, it's all fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Kobe instead of my normal sushi hangout. I'd give it 2.5 and label it as average. The sushi wasn't very fresh.  The rolls were sloppy and falling apart. There isn't much more to say about the place."}
{"text":"Came here to get all you can eat sushi, but found the dinner special to meet my needs. Service was not bad. The food was good! Would definitely recommend to someone who is trying to watch how much they eat for a good price. All you can eat places can be dangerous for me lol."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in town, never fails for my husband and I. Fast service, very welcoming, and again, sushi is simply the best here  loyal customers here for sure!"}
{"text":"WARNING!!! DONT DINE HERE!! Went here a couple of weeks ago and felt compelled to finally write a review to warn other yelpers. This place is TERRIBLE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS and DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Dined in with a friend one evening, only to receive the worst service and average (most likely BELOW average) sushi in all of Las Vegas. Took me six times to summon the waitress so I could get more tea, ginger, and low sodium soy sauce . Also ordered a small house salad that came 35 minutes after two of my average rolls and a cold miso soup. The waitress had an attitude when I asked her why it was taking so long to prepare my small salad as I was staring at my sushi rolls. When I finally had it, I requested to speak to the manager, who also has a terrible attitude like his employees and his entire establishment. He listened to my complaints; however, was more concerned about me paying the bill. Paid the bill, left no gratuity for \"service\", and had an aching belly until the best day. If you like deplorable sushi & terrible service, this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. Sushi is always good and the service is prompt. We love the discounts for happy hour sushi...makes the drive worth it. We recently moved out of the way a little but still make it over for happy hour sushi. Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"This USED to be my favorite sushi restaurant. Avocado was brown, crunch rolls were soggy, my sushi was made wrong. When I asked them to re-make it, I got huge attitude from the server."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Delicious sushi and I like the new specials, very affordable. I'll definitely be crack!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special, one of the best in the Summerlin area. I'm now writing to feel space as I'm out of ideas. Come here though, it's awesome."}
{"text":"When my friends and I decide to have sushi at \"the usual\" we all know this is the place to meet! Staff is friendly, atmosphere is relaxing & inviting and the menu selection is INCREDIBLE!!! This is DEFINITELY one of my FAVES and our GO-TO spots!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Kobe for a couple years and there have been changes and I do have to say they have turned out to be changes for the best..the sushi rolls have improved and the specials are great. The atmosphere is always nice and the staff friendly .. I recommend this place often.."}
{"text":"Actually this is my second time here, first one was like everything in sashimi section is limited order, ok i get it maybe they are not really into serving sashimi on ayce... but my second time is still the same and a lot worst  on their sashimi, one order only for one person. I am just rating this 4 star because of the server, she is very nice and very comforting on how i felt about one order limit for sashimi."}
{"text":"Very friendly  stuff. Fantastic lunch/dinner specials... Love to go there for lunch as everyone knows me by name (I am a regular). Thank you guys!!!!  You Rock! Soto is the greatest chef!!!  Strongly recommend their \"All you can eat\" sushi! I once forgot my wallet at home and they made me feel really awesome by stating that I am a regular customer and they trust me. I returned to pay them  the next day. No pressures at all... Wonderful food/ great stuff.  Strongly recommend folks!"}
{"text":"after reading the reviews I threw caution to the wind.. verdict..... very friendly sushi chef... fresh fish decent price.. did the all you can eat for $24..."}
{"text":"My daughter ordered take out, was expensive and very tiny portions. Beef teriyaki was chewy and the shrimp was very puny and sad looking. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"First time back at KOBE for happy hour in years... must say it's good!!! Big Hamachi Kama!!! Loads of Ikura!!! And the 'Rock n Roll' roll was yummy.... 

Recommendation: Happy Hour Friday and Saturday nights!!! =) 

I used to come here a lot for all you can eat sushi, but then I lost interest for a bit...and I probably would have given this place 3 stars back then.  But then I moved states and now I'm back. So glad I decided to give it another go and come here tonight."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Kobe Sushi for the first time tonight and we have found our new favorite local sushi spot! We were greeted promptly by our server and the sushi is delicious! Definitely will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This is one of worst sushi bars I ever been too . The service sucked the waitress took like 20 mins to give me a refill of my water . And to top it off she came over and tried to see if I tipped her a lot of money or something that's just very rude you should wait till the customer leaves to get the check. So 0$ tip for her . The sushi was the most bland sushi I ever ate . Never going back again ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi place! The food is always good, always fresh. Service is exceptional! 

They offer all you can eat lunch and dinner special at very reasonable price, not to mention a happy hour! The wait is usually not long and you can get seated almost instantly most of the time!"}
{"text":"still my favorite sushi restaurant! best sushi i've ever eaten. but, waitress should be a bit more on top of things and not paying attention to her boyfriend sitting at a table.. other than that, soto always makes my experience there great!"}
{"text":"Came in right at opening a few weeks ago sushi chef hasn't yet arrived but the service was great and brought us out some apps while we waited the whole the minutes for him to get in and prepare. Sushi was fresh and a good AYCE quality."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi spot. Great dinner and drink menu, large selection on rolls made me happy. Service is amazing, very friendly and always attentive. They have a good selection for kids as well. Happy hour everyday at 9pm - 11pm. Definitely going to make this my new sushi spot."}
{"text":"I love the lunch special best. Just need 9.99. Red dragon is very delicious . Salmon skin sala very good. I come every week"}
{"text":"Husband and I decided to try this sushi bar going with the mind that it would be a pleasant experience. I can give them credit for there sushi tasting very yummy . I can honestly say that is the only reason why they get two stars . Service was horrible starting with the waitress coming to take our drink orders and in the middle of us ordering our drinks she left for about 12 minutes doing other things . Husband had to call her over so she can get us started . I ordered the Grand Canyon roll which was very good . I also ordered the lasagna roll which is my favorite roll . My husband ordered his rolls . We both had 2 rolls first and then we placed another order of rolls my husband orders 2
Half rolls and I ordered 1 full and pork fried rice .  
I'm not sure if this applies every where but we have gone to many other sushi bars that never tell us anything about the limit to half rolls . After I was done with my full roll I wanted to place an order of half a \" Mexican roll \" and half of the lasagna roll . I wasn't even done saying the first roll but it's like the waitress read my mind . She automatically turned me down and said we couldn't order half rolls that we were only allowed to order one half roll but till the end . She also looked at my por fried rice and said if I didn't finish the pork fried rice then she's going to have to charge me for it  full price . Okay we understand it says it in the menu , any left food will be charged . I get it ! She didn't have to be rude about it she had no idea what was going on at that moment I could be eating my sushi and at the same time eating my damn rice . Sorry for that but it made me upset on how she said it . So after like 15 minutes later they bring me my last roll of lasagna and it was super BURNT . Like if they did it on purpose. I did tell the waiter at the time sense the waitress that was helping us at first had left . I canceled the order and just ordered a moshi but he told us there was none at the moment . Just my luck . Overall I customer service was horrible . That would be the first and last time for us ."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their happy hour.  It's such a great deal.  The happy hour limitations and menu change occasionally, but it is still generally about 1/2 off during those times.  It's not the fanciest or best quality sushi in my opinion but they have a wide variety of rolls, specialty, and regular menu items like friend rice and noodles.  I love that I can always ask for a side of spicy garlic ponzu sauce to dip all my sushi in.  Better than soy sauce!  I'll always come back to this place if I've got a craving for sushi and a bottomless belly."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly! Clean inside! $1 beer and sake during football game! Fish wasn't the freshest but otherwise great!!"}
{"text":"I came here once with a restaurants.com gift card...and I can't believe how all-over-the-place these reviews are. Our food was great, the service was polite, the chef was attentive...I didn't get a refill as often as I'd like (sat with an empty cup until i was about to leave), and there was a really loudmouth ass at the sushi bar with his lady friend.
It was nice and empty about 4pm on a weds. I'd return, especially with a coupon!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi bars that i ever taste, service is excellent, Fae went above and beyond explaining all the rolls and shashimi items, great value for a excellent sushi, compliments to the chef as well, thanks for a excellent meal"}
{"text":"I visited tonight for the first time and ordered three rolls: a rainbow roll, volcano roll, and screaming orgasm.

They brought out the rainbow roll first.  It tasted great, super fresh, so I was looking forward to the rest of my rolls.

The volcano roll, on the other hand, was probably the worst version of the volcano roll I've ever had.  There were no scallops, which I'm used to having, the yum yum sauce tasted a little funny, and they unnecessarily added hot sauce.  I ended up scraping off the yum yum sauce and just having the baked salmon and the California roll.

The screaming orgasm was decent.  Again, the sauce didn't taste like what I'm used to, but it was definitely a better ending after the terrible volcano roll.

Service was okay, and the 50% off the entire menu was pretty good.  A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.  

Unfortunately, I don't believe I'll ever come back to this place.  There are MUCH better alternatives all over town."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Server is rude. Took so long for the food I ordered that I asked her to cancel my order. Im never eating here again."}
{"text":"This is gonna be my last time here, everything I ordered is so nasty.."}
{"text":"I love sushi as much as the next person, and followed a favorite sushi chef here from another restaurant- my general conclusion is that I would not come back here if it weren't for him. There's nothing that stands out about this place (positive or negative) enough to warrant a return- note that the AYCE dinner is $27, a bit higher than the average here in town but only by a couple of bucks.

I did like the Crazy Jalapenos dish on the menu, which is a sushi take on stuffed and fried peppers with a smidge of cream cheese and crab inside- haven't seen that elsewhere. Appetizers seemed to be few, only desserts I saw were mochi- they did have the cappuccino flavor I really like, though.

Menu has about thirty rolls, many of which you've seen elsewhere- I was surprised to see the Grand Canyon roll available here. I was able to get a variety of fresh nigiri that the chef selected for me, but the overall fish quality seemed different- not as flavorful, light but almost on the bland side. Some pieces had an odd texture as if the wrong type of knife were used, or someone doesn't know what they're doing.

Interior is nice, sat at sushi bar, hostess and chefs are polite and friendly- place gets really busy on weekends. They have lunch specials through 3PM advertised outside. I drove past this place many times before noticing it- it's directly to the right of the Von's."}
{"text":"Started coming to the restaurant for a few months. Service is very slow for the lack of customers in there. However the food was decent and we continued to go. However,the waitress messed up our order and than argued with us that we were wrong. Not the best business strategy but not surprised due to lack of customers. I recommend that the owner of this established either hire new staff or take a business 101 course on how to run a business and treat customers. Will no longer be coming back to this place. Surprised it has not closed down yet."}
{"text":"Kobe is our new favorite sushi place!
The fish is fresh and the service is the best!
Soto is creative, fun, and he makes your time even more enjoyable. We highly recommend this place to all you die hard sushi fans!!!

{"text":"There was a bit of a wait, but it was fine because they only had one sushi chef! The price was 24 for all you can eat dinner, the rolls were excellent, service was fantastic. We had to leave in a rush and asked the waitress to cancel our last roll. However, the waitress misunderstood and asked the chef to speed up the roll, which he did but we really didn't have time to eat it. The manager let us take it even though it's technically against the rules. We didn't have to out up a fight or anything he just understood the misunderstanding. I'll be here again."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and also my last. I was excited that we found this place because we'd been looking for a good sushi place. The food was actually really good but I was disappointed with the service. We walked in and immediately were seated. Waitress came not to long after that and took out order. One of the items I ordered was the super white tuna only to find out a few minutes later that they didn't have any. Ok, no big deal I just ordered the yellow tail nigiri instead and also an order of the sweet shrimp nigiri but we assume they forgot because those items didn't come out with our first round. We finished our first round and were ready to order seconds. It took them a while to acknowledge that we were ready to order more. Finally after maybe 5-10 minutes the waitress came and we ordered more food which consisted of 2 more rolls and some salmon nigiri. After we placed our order the yellow tail nigiri that at this point was already forgotten about was brought out. They brought the rest of the salmon nigiri and one of the rolls. After maybe five minutes waitress came back and asked how everything was, I told her that I was still missing my roll. She went back to the bar and came back and told me that it be right out because they had forgotten to make it. Before they brought it out they delivered the sweet shrimp nigiri that was ordered like 45 minutes ago in the first round. Totally disappointed because their food tasted really good. They just need to figure out a better way to keep track of their orders. I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to order food or to get more water specially when it's a all you an eat with a time limit. Like I said before the food tasted great, service however can be improved."}
{"text":"Tuesday and Friday lunch and v dinner chefs rocks. . Great food,  great service,  awesome place.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Why must I succumb to standard sushi in the land of plenty?

With all the buffets and other restaurants in Vegas, we settled for this place out of sheer desperation and famine.  We should've continued to starve until one of the better places opened.

Oh well, lesson learned.

Sushi has the potential to be okay.

The bento box and appetizers were bland at best.

They offer an all you can eat after 5 pm which is a good option since their specialty rolls are overpriced.

Overall, this isn't the worst fake Japanese place I've eaten."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sushi is so fresh every time! My favorite sushi in Las Vegas  soto is an amazing sushi chef. Come check it out!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite one . 


Danny roll and shirm tempura roll. And is cheap  the all u can eat special       And the service is pretty good too"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi from extensive menu.  Fast service.  Fridays and Saturdays everything is half price except ramen bowls."}
{"text":"First Timer on January 6th 2017. Sushi Koma ended up being an hour wait and it was simply not worth it. Drove a few streets down and found this \"hole in the wall\" location, Kobe Sushi Bar. Waited literally 2 seconds to be seated, so I was a happy camper. I had a great first time experience, thanks to the chill environment, the variety of the menu and our great chef, Soto. 

The menu seemed overwhelming at first, with many choices to choose from. My first roll that I always go with first, the Tiger Roll. If a Sushi place has an amazing Tiger Roll, I will always recommend that place to friends. However, this roll in particular, fell flat. They overdid it on the Spicy Tuna, it was so much I couldn't taste the Shrimp Tempura. Thankfully, everything I ordered after that was delicious and made with love. The Garlic Tuna and Salmon Nigiri was definitely fresh. The Rainbow Roll was made perfectly, and each Roll stood out the way it was supposed to. 

Our chef was one the best parts of the experience. Soto made me feel super comfortable and even suggested other customers' favorites. He was enthusiastic, funny and loved that he was there. 

They don't do half rolls, which is a big con to coming here for AYCE. I'm the type that wants to try everything on the menu, so I was disappointed when I found out they do not do this. They also don't have loyalty stamp cards, which I feel like would bring back more loyal and consistent customers and be on a more competitive level with Goyemon an Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Nothing really did it for me here. The prices weren't bad, but I ended up not liking a majority of the food I ordered. Rolls weren't great, neither was the tempura fish. Too fishy. I ended up having to order another side of teriyaki chicken just to fill up since I was still hungry after not eating the rest of my food."}
{"text":"The servers were really nice but the food takes awhile. I waited an hour for my poki salad which I ended up canceling after they followed up on it the third time."}
{"text":"Great options for ayce and other options at a great price. Sushi, fried rice, udon, etc.  staff is very attentive and quick.  Happy to explore this place."}
{"text":"Meh. If you want cheap-ish sushi that isn't all that great... then this is probably the perfect place to go ! 

This place offers happy hour on Friday & Saturday nights, which means 50% off their whole menu. It's really the only time you get value for your money. Their regular prices are ridiculously over priced, especially for the quality and taste of their food. 

DO:
- Get the stuffed jalepenos. 
- Take advantage of half off beer. 

DON'T:
- Eat there other than happy hour. 
- Heck, don't eat there if you're even considering a different sushi place.
- Expect good service."}
{"text":"Sushi is too small and texture of rice is not good. This is westernized sushi. Not very authentic here."}
{"text":"Very poor service. If this restaurant would like to survive then the manager will need to train their servers about proper customer service that is even if they have one. I noticed this place has fewer people coming in and I am 100% sure that has to do with their service. Food is okay, nothing outrageous, I think the happy hour sign will get rookies to come in but the food alone are overprice and the serving isn't that big therefore you get 50% off during happy hour which equals to basically the same as most sushi places."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, nothing that I would NEED to go back for.  

I'm not an all-you-can-eat sushi type of girl, actually I'm not an al-you-can-eat anything type of girl...and I'm not opposed to spending good money on a sushi experience.  I was there during their \"happy hour\" and most everything on the menu was 50% off.  I wasn't paying attention to prices, but I ordered screaming orgasm, and it turned out to be 5 pieces of too-thick tuna for $17.  Totally overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi, relaxed atmosphere, and super friendly service. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Sorry...this place is no good.  Fish was not fresh...server gave me trouble when I tried to make a minor change to a roll...I have felt pretty sick the last 24 hours as well.   Stay away and go a few extra blocks and spend a few extra bucks at Naked Fish"}
{"text":"Who would of thought, looking for an open sushi joint at 2 in the afternoon would be a chore.  After being turned down by two japanese restaurants, that opened later in the afternoon, my friends and I decided to try our luck elsewhere.  We drove by a couple of strip malls, which vaguely advertised a sushi joint by displaying \"sushi\" on their directory, along with their requisite \"massage\" parlor.  So, we continued driving around for a bit until we actually saw a sushi bar that had a name.  Kobe Sushi Bar, the words displayed in a sports bar kinda font.  Alright, we'll give it a shot.

The interior looks a lot better than the store front, strip mall look.  The tables and chair are black with a modern feel.  And there is a sushi bar in the back, with a display board on the wall, listing all of Kobe's specialty rolls and prices.  Whoever, wrote the specials made the 1's look like 4's, so we thought at first, all the rolls costed about $45, instead of $15.

The menu has a lunch special, which consists of teriyaki bowls, pan fried and hot soup noodles, three combination bento boxes (chicken, beef, salmon), korean bbq ribs, and a sushi combo.  Also, there is a separate sushi list, which you can mark off, to order.

The sashimi was decent.  The saba (mackarel) was ok.  The hamachi was pretty good and the white tuna was really good.  The rolls were also pretty good.  The spicy tuna roll with more tuna on the outside had a nice spicy kick to it.

For appetizers, we got the yakitori which was ok, the tempura combo came with shrimp, calamari, and vegetables, and a soft shell crab.

**Soft Shell Crab Review**
As always, I must try the soft shell crab at any new sushi joint.
I give Kobe's a thumbs down.  The crab looked really dinky and battered.  No dipping sauce for the crab except for the tempura sauce we already had.

We also ordered a chicken bento box.  It came with miso soup, salad, a california roll.  The chicken looked preprocessed because the pieces looked so darned symmetrical.

All in all the meal was decent.  Some sake and beer with our food made the experience a pretty good time."}
{"text":"That awkward moment when you sit at the sushi bar and wait to place your order and a cockroach crawls across the bar... hmmmm... yup! Not gonna happen... nope!"}
{"text":"the ambience is really nice. it's calm and a really good hang out for winding down and having dinner. their rolls are really good and are a good portioned size. it's family friendly, as well as good for small gatherings and a quick eat. one of the only places I know where you can pick your own plates and make a dinner with three menu items!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! I get one mommy day off day with my best friend a month and this was our pick. So good! Amazing attentive service. Highly recommend for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place at least 20 times and always see the specials thinking wow we should go. Finally my boyfriend and I thought hey, let's do this. 

Walking in they were friendly and seated us immediately. We explained it was our first time here. The waitress explained there was happy hour and there was all you can eat sushi. We compared the menu and prices and decided to do all you can eat since it was only 23 a person for dinner. 

Salmon belly, fresh and great. Only one order per person for dinner

Dumplings. Great size. Good filling. Perfectly steamed. I hate when they are soggy. 

I can't remember all the names of the rolls because we had about the of them but they were all very good and fresh. The only little complaint I have is that the ones that said they were spicy were not that spicy (boyfriend complaint) but I'm not a fan of spicy rolls so I thought they had a kick but were delicious. Very good food for a even greater price. This restaurant had a very nice family feel. 

Waitress was good on refilling drinks, recommending rolls, and keeping food coming. They had a full house and we never waited more than 5 -10 minutes for rolls or whatever we ordered. 

Like the large amount of options for mochi."}
{"text":"I ordered sushi through GrubHub.   They use black styrofoam containers.   I ate a couple pieces, looked down, and saw a roach crawl from underneath one of my pieces of sushi.   I think this place needs some cleaning up.  I would not recommend this."}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Food was fresh. Place was clean. Service was ok but could be better."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with the service. Waters were filled on time. Cecille was a perfect waitress and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I recommend to go this restaurant. Sushi chef, \"soto\" he is serving fresh fish for me all the time and making fancy create rolls.  Also they are so friendly and good service too."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite go to place. It's gone down the drain.  Literally.  Service became horribl and they started being sneaky.   I came in for a lunch special To-Go, I ordered scallop nigiri, Apache roll, and red dragon.  The Apache roll is supposed to have scallop in the roll.  The lady walked up to me and said \"sorry we don't have anymore scallop, please order a different nigiri\". Okay, it's okay restaurants run out of stuff all the time.  I asked \"can I change my roll then please because Apache roll is supposed to have scallop\". She said no sorry Apache roll has a different kind of scallop\" what????? Whatever I decided to trust her.  I brought my roll home and the roll didn't have any scallop. At that point I couldn't go back and complain, I dealt with what I got.  This was the last straw. I once ordered a roll that should of had salmon on top, but didn't.  The only reason I went here was the deal was unbeatable.  I rather drive a few miles to another place then come back here and get lied too.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5 years now and I don't know happened, but it's gone down hill fast. Today we came in for \"all you can eat\". To start with, upon arrival they assume you want the lunch special (they make more off of all you can eat, suggestive selling works guys, try it). Then we order, and the waitress does not read the order back (accuracy). Then they start bringing out the rolls. The waitress sets it in front of us and walks away without an explanation of the roll or even a smile. The quality has never been so bad. DID NOT TASTE FRESH AT ALL!! We got 2 green muscles and only one had hot sauce?? Then they just didn't bring out the nigiri and two of the rolls. When asked why, we were told we still had 3 pieces of the spicy crab rolls... So we don't get the other items ordered because we are still eating another roll?!? When we request the other items we had already ordered the \"owner/chef\" rolls his eyes and gives the waitress a look as if to say, they're annoying... We are also paying customers. So in conclusion, this place has horrible service and horrible quality; DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and everything looked nice and clean. The staff was friendly and attentive, always checking on us. The sushi tasted great and for the lunch price of $20 its worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best jap restaurant in summerlin, look for Allen very nice and good chef."}
{"text":"Soto is hands down amazing! My roommates and I would go every week to see him and have him make us our sushi. Without fail every week. I have recently moved out of Vegas and now live in AZ. My husband I have look everywhere for sushi like his and have been disappointed every time. Now when I go visit Vegas I will always stop and see him where ever he goes!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot! I found this place when the old Kobe closed. Always great service and delicious fresh sushi. They have a great special.. one appetizer plus two rolls for $13.99 (Same deal for $9.99 at lunch time)"}
{"text":"I come here a lot it's right next to me.. everything is good not great but not bad either and the last time I came which was yesterday I have seen they have new items in the menu.. that's great!!! This time I got the lunch special which is $9.99 and u get 3 items.. I posted my 3 items along with the new items of the menu"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi of all kinds. Great selection. They also have wonderful tempura too.  I did a review of this place before but I didn't post a picture. This time I have one photo.
I like the inside since they changed it several months ago. There are rice paper dividers between tables which gives you more privacy."}
{"text":"Sushi here is always so fresh and yummy. They also have a huge variety of sushi rolls with pictures for all the sushi beginners. All you can eat is totally worth it here! Staff is very attentive and sweet! You have the sushi bar in front of you which is very convenient!"}
{"text":"I went on Saturday 12/07/13 at about 6:30 PM and it was 1/2 off everything.  I only had miso soup & the Mexican roll (spicy crab, topped w/shrimp & avocado) and they were both good.  I had some of my friends scallop roll, don't re-call which one but it was good too.  Extensive roll menu, so many to pick from, most very similar.  Place was clean & waitress was polite.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"Used to come here often when I was single and lived in the apartment complex next door.  Brought my family here for the first time tonight and will def be the last.  We waited for someone to take our order for 30 min, no shit I am not joking.....30 min until we decided to leave since and go somewhere else.  The servers were not at all attentive and it was frustrating"}
{"text":"Love the sake at kobe sushi bar had 3 already with dinner . All you can eat is best value in town."}
{"text":"This place had just okay sushi. The prices are good. HOWEVER, the service is the absolutely worse! The waitress/hostess was unaware of people waiting to even turn in their order. When I received the wrong roll I approached the cook and his response was not that he was sorry but that I should have told him exactly what I wanted. I thought that was what the menu was for? Worse ever. Don't waste your time here. Three tables were used and all three while I was there complained about the service."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to go for sushi, the only place I've been happy to regularly go to. Affordable, yummy, and great service. The waitress and sushi chefs even begin to remember you/your orders which makes everything incredibly convenient!"}
{"text":"Okay, really this place is overpriced for what it is, so 50% off is not really 50% off on all items. Some of the premium rolls can run up to $16 but most are $14 and below. But with the 50% off on Fridays and Saturdays, it becomes the best a la carte Sushi deal in town.

Seaweed Salad for example was $2.75 after the discount. I felt this dish was a bargain at that price, but would have never paid so much without the discount. Similar with the spicy tuna and specialty salmon roll I ordered (I forgot the name of which). The Spicy Tuna roll was $3.50 and the Salmon Roll around $6.50 after the discount. Both tasted great and the texture of the salmon was most excellent. Only complaint about the sushi itself would be that they seemed to use a little bit too much rice in it.

I have a hard time giving this place higher than three stars though because other than the half-off special, there seems to me little reason to go here. But 5 stars Friday and Saturday nights! Overpriced and go somewhere else any other time, their a la carte is expensive and the all you can eat is a little high as well."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was great!  The lunch special is awesome.  A must try if you love sushi."}
{"text":"I'm giving full stars because this place really turned around. I came in for lunch and the special was perfect. Service was good. Some slip ups but its okay because sometimes things happen. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. We got all you can eat sushi and they literally served us one roll at a time and asked us if we wanted the next one when we finished the roll and took forever to make the food causing us to get full quickly and wasting our money."}
{"text":"Great sushi at an amazing price! Some of the most affordable AYCE in Vegas. This is my go to spot for sushi!"}
{"text":"I am a cheapskate. I readily admit to this, and it's personality flaw that led me to Kobe Sushi.

You see, I had a coupon that promised half-price sushi and the skinflint in me couldn't resist what I thought was a good deal. I should have listened to my inner skeptic instead.

The sushi here was mediocre. I had saba (mackerel), unagi (eel), kanpai roll and red dragon roll. The nigiri sushi was fine, but there's not much involved in putting a piece of fish on top of a lump of rice. The rolls were another story.

It seems this place is yet another \"fusion\" sushi joint. To me, \"fusion\" sushi equals cheap ingredients haphazardly thrown together, drowned in sauce and given a ridiculous name. And Kobe Sushi is no exception. I could only eat a couple of pieces of the kanpai roll. It had no flavor whatsoever, despite a generous slathering of mayo. The red dragon roll was a spicy tuna roll with tuna on top. The flavor was all spice and no tuna. I could tell the tuna had been previously frozen and had little if any flavor.

The only redeeming quality was the price. For $15, I left with a belly full of cheap but substandard sushi. 

Note to self: Really good restaurants don't offer coupons. They don't have to."}
{"text":"First time trying Kobe Sushi yesterday. I read review before I go and menu looks nice, but had pretty bad experience there. When I get there, only 2 Party were there and we sat down right away and guy server took order and brought us drink. We order dinner combo menu which you can pick 1 appetizer and 2 sushi roll. My boyfriend got his appetizer first which was sashimi salad. I order Takosu(which is octopus marinated with vinegar) and I thought both of them were pretty easy but oh well I waited. My boyfriend got his 2 roll (entree) and we both looked each other like.. what is going on? I still not received my appetizer. Patiently waiting, one of the server who is lady, sitting on the sushi bar and eating and drinking beer... hmmm I'm not sure if she is on break or something but she still ran food.  When lady server who has been drinking beer came to my table with dish which was Tonkatsu (deep fried Pork) and tried to leave my table so I asked her which dish this is? And she answered \"Takosu\". I asked her are you sure because I don't see Tonkatsu on the dinner combo menu and she pointed at Takosu and told me \"oh this picture is with rice so looks different\". I told her what Tokosu is and she didn't seems happy and told me that she will get back to me. By this point, my boyfriend sushi rice getting hard so I told him to eat. She came back to the table and told me \"you were right. They are making your appetizer now\" but no apology... already stated to get annoyed but keep my self calm down. After he finished his entire meal, I still haven't get anything for myself and at this point, my boyfriend asked me if I want to leave. She came back with real \"Takosu\" and one of my roll... ok now I am missing 1 roll out of 2. Guy server who took our order came back and asked me if I get everything. I told him it took forever to get my appetizer and now 1 roll is missing. He tried to check on us after that to make sure we are having better time after that but it was just too much. Price was pretty good. Food was just alright. If you have time to eat and drink beer, I will like to tell her to learn more your menu and apologize for your mistake. I was eating my meal alone and it was just awful experience. None of the manager or anybody else came to check on us either. This is why I gave them 1 Star."}
{"text":"This restaurant has these signs posted at every table but when you show them a positive review they say \"we're not doing that promo anymore\" ... Then why is it posted at every table lol??? Stupid!"}
{"text":"Their sushi is always fresh and their food is always good. Their service is lacking throughout the years we have been coming here. It seems to be getting worse as we visit. The owner is always friendly and helpful and some servers."}
{"text":"Best $10 lunch sushi lunch special in town! Service was great, selection was awesome, quality was better than expected, and I got in and out in under 35 minutes. Can't beat it! I am definitely going to become a regular."}
{"text":"#1 sign that a sushi place is going to suck: no Asians. anywhere. customers or employees. Not being racist (I'm Filipino... but I can tell the difference between a Korean \"sushi\" place and a Japanese one...ya know?)

Anywho.

Food was overpriced and just OK.  The lady looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if they had a Chirashi bowl.  I ended up ordering a Sashimi Salad that was DROWNED in ponzu (love ponzu... don't need to be swimming in it).

We also ordered a Chicken Teriyaki Plate, Spicy Tuna Hand Roll, Saba Nigiri, Japanese Lasagna, Spicy Scallop Roll and Fried Banana dessert. $90 for 2 1/2 people (count our 3-year old as a half person since all she eats is rice and dessert) Wasn't terrible, but probably won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"First time here and my family and I enjoyed it very much. Sushi was fresh, affordable and fast. The staff was very kind and happy hour was great!"}
{"text":"I went to this Kobe Sushi location last night, and I was impressed.  The sushi tasted excellent and was a fresh as the previous location.  The crazy Jalapeno roll is one of my favorites, but they have a great menu.  The sushi rollers know what they are doing and they're willing to adapt to your order wants.

The place is clean and the service is great.
50% off all sushi and sake during the late night hours.
Around $20 a person for five people and myself to stuff ourselves and drink our bodyweight in sake; nice!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi rest. It's a quaint place and I've never had an issue with customer service. The Lisa Lisa is my favorite there. The weekend half off everything special is a great deal. My only critique is not allowing customers to order half rolls for the AYCE."}
{"text":"This sushi bar is near by me , which I order a udon noodle and it's wasn't very tasty and the amount of the food was a not worth of the price."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place that I will remain loyal to! The sushi chefs (Allan and Soto) always are so nice and even know what I like when I go in there. Lerma is also so very helpful when I go in. Also, the prices are very affordable, especially with happy hour! Wouldn't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome prices. Great service. My go-to sushi place on Flamingo and Ft Apache. Lunch specials and all you can eat options are amazing."}
{"text":"We were greeted right when walking in, the server cleaned our table again before seating us, and brought our water right away.. As first timers, they explained the menu, and surprising,  even the Bento plates were half off!
The sashimi was buttery and so good! The Cherry Blossom was huge! (We didn't finish it) and the baked salmon roll - yum!
Katsu was a little overcooked,  but overall, great value for the food!"}
{"text":"Been going here for a while, but now they're inconsistent with service and with food quality. There's usually only one chef, so if things get busy you sit for a while. Lunch special is a good deal but not if you have to wait 40 minutes!
Servers seem annoyed and put out if you ask for something. Time to find a new spot!"}
{"text":"This sushi joint is so awesome! Services is one point and very quick. Happy hour is 50% the entire menu!"}
{"text":"This place has great happy hour specials--the entire menu is half off--on Fridays and Saturdays from 5 pm to 1 am.  The menu is extensive and the food tastes great.  Their desserts are large and inexpensive.  The service is pretty good and relatively fast.  This is pretty much the only place I go for sushi now."}
{"text":"Sushi Chef Soto is bomb!!! Once he gets to know your palate he will prepare a varietal of delicacies for your pleasure! His attentiveness and unparalleled service is what makes this restaurant establishment great! Suggestion, sit at the sushi bar for the ultimate Soto experience!"}
{"text":"Really pretty good. The salmon was fresh, and the staff friendly. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Las Vegas hands down because of the great staff. When you visit, sit at the bar and be served by the awesome Chef Soto! I promise he will take care of you and the more you visit, he will learn your taste buds & offer you new and different items each time :) He makes this place awesome. 

Also try the hamachi Kama, hamachi belly, and mixed scallop sushi!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Sushi spot. The all you can eat Menu is amazing with a wide variety of choices from a CA roll to their Grand Canyon Roll. They even have specials on Friday & Saturday. ..50% off after 5pm and that includes Sake. Today I'm having the $13.99 three item combo special. Yum yum time!!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time and absolutely LOVE happy hour! Most of the time we do All You Can Eat, I love the Rainbow Roll and all of the sashimi and nigiri! Great merlot too! Friendly and attentive staff, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible! The sushi does not taste good. In addition it's all you can eat but when we asked for more rolls they told us no because we had an order coming up but they take forever. They have a stupid one hour limit but they purposely take long to try to get you up to your hour. The only thing good about this place is the price it's 23 bucks for all you can eat dinner but the service and food sucks! Don't come here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were there for dinner on Sunday 3/18/2018.  When we walked in the place smelled like a sewer. My friend from Seattle mentioned the smell. Embarrassing since I had recommended the place from past experience. After about 15 minutes the smell dissipated thank goodness because I was thinking about leaving before we ordered. My friend asks the waiter about Saki. The waiter states he knows nothing about the saki or food there because he does not eat there. WTH???  So my friend wound up ordering Saki he liked but there was a Saki menu hidden behind a tray of condiments some of which he would have liked better . Luckily the rolls, sashimi and oysters were very good still, otherwise the evening would have been an embarrassing disaster."}
{"text":"Pretty upset with this place, Been here twice and got the same result both times. Terrible service sushi & is not that great. I got AYCE, I didnt get half the stuff I ordered and since I was on my lunch break couldn't just sit around and wait all day for it. Had to ask for our drinks to be re-filled & ask her if she remember to put our order in after 45 minutes of nothing. The place wasn't even busy. I left un-happy, hungry, and $22 in the hole."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my best friend on a weeknight. It reminded me of fast food sushi.  Food was OK and service was decent.  There weren't very many customers so staff was very quick and hospitable.  We opted for a few rolls with soup and salad which was like a dinner combo.  Overall, we had an enjoyable dining experience for a quiet girl's night with dinner and conversation.   For the price it was decent, but in comparison to other sushi restaurants in town taste was just below average.  Rolls were heavily sauced and had a ton of rice, none memorable.  Sashimi salad had good flavor and pieces of fish were cut large, but it wasn't quite fresh in my opinion.  Probably wouldn't go back as there was nothing quite tasty enough to return for, but it was convenient since we were in that location and at the time it satisfied quick sushi fix at a low price."}
{"text":"I was in the hood and feeling like sushi so I stopped here. I got the dinner special $13.99 for 3 items. Any 3 items! Pretty good deal. Quality is sushi is up to par, nothing riveting but I'd come again because I like being able to select my items and create my own meal without gorging on All U Can Eat. They also have the AUCE option. The wait staff was really attentive and the facility was clean, with a few flat screens for you sports fans."}
{"text":"I had Kobe sushi one year ago and it was a pleasant experience. I decided to try it again, expecting the same result. I was reminded that we can hope for the best but should always expect the worse. 
 My brother ordered some nigiri: salmon, uni, maguro and hamachi. He seemed satisfied with most of the bite-sized morsels of seafood with one exception, the tuna. It came to the table a bubblegum pink. Very unappetizing visually. He ate one piece of the bubblegum twins and decided that bazooka joe on a ball of rice does not equal deliciousness. 
My mom ordered what she always ordered when she eats at a Japanese restaurant, Katsu udon. I peeked into her bowl and it looked like a layer of beige oatmeal with the consistency of loogies (which I guess was an egg mixture of some sort) on top of over cooked pork cutlet. She took one bite, spit it out into a napkin and said \"this is the WORST Katsu udon I've ever had.\" This is coming from a women who is ancient, with probably 100,000+ Katsu udon meals under her belt. 
I played it safe with my order and since I wasn't very hungry, I ordered a shrimp tempura roll. One would think that it would be impossible to mess up a simple tempura roll, but Kobe sushi has a special talent when it comes to creating gross dishes. It was cold and filled up with so much imitation crab (which I call the hot dog of the sea) that I couldn't even taste a hint of shrimp. And it was gooey upon chewing with zero if the crunchiness I love about tempura rolls. I'm not sure if it was the eel sauce or if the sushi chef spit in my roll (we returned that bowl of \"Katsu udon\" and  probably upset the chef by now with all our complaints) but something in it was gooey. To top it all off, I spotted a long gray hair coming out of the depths of sea hotdog. Of course I had to spot it AFTER I took a bite. 
I feel bad about ripping Kobe sushi so hard in this review because the waitress was pleasant and genuinely seemed embarrassed and sorry that the experience was going so bad. And she didn't charge us for the Katsu udon. But it was honestly one of the worst sushi meals I've ever had, so bad that I was compelled to write this extremely long and detailed review about it. Avoid this place at all costs. Order a syphilis infested prostitute from a jerry curled pimp before you order sushi from this place."}
{"text":"I'm a regular to this joint, the place is always clean, near a lvac which is huge plus for me, and the special are totally worth the stop just go check the place out. Kristal was my host/server. She was amazing, attentive, and super personable. If you stop by, make sure to ask for her special sauce, the jalapeño ponzu. It's is way better than your average soy."}
{"text":"First time eating here, the eel sushi are delicious. The cucumber and seaweed are delicious. Lots of selection. Our server/host was very friendly. Definitely coming back here coming on next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I come to Kobe sushi at least one a week!  Super speedy service and some of the best prices for sushi around! 
The waitresses always kindly greet me ( as I'm always here ).
I'm currently at Kobe enjoying a nice dinner ! With one of my favorite waitresses pae.

Definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Great food!!! Amazing service! The best sushi place in town and reasonable prices. Love it!"}
{"text":"Solid sushi spot. Service was great, both the hostess and chef were very friendly. The rolls were also very good! They have your traditional rolls such as 007 or Japanese lasagna, in addition they have their house specials as well. If you're on this side of town I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for sushi for years and I mean 4 yrs. I usually go on Fridays and Saturdays due to the 50% off deal. The rolls are always delicious and the service is great. I love sushi so I have tried a bunch of different places but for the price this is the best place to eat at on Fridays or Saturdays after 5pm. Don't get me wrong the food is great regardless of the price, but that deal makes it incomparable."}
{"text":"Okay, I understand that sushi bars in Vegas feel a real pressure to offer an all-you-can-eat special to their customers, it's important to remain competitive in this sushi saturated market - but one gets the impression that Kobe really despises this simple fact. 

Sure they're not the only sushi bar that charges more for single serve items (after all they have to make up the difference) - but those customers that do decide to order off the single serve menu expect some sort of value for their dollar.

My fare included one roll, one pair of tuna nigiri and a seafood salad. With a glass of water my bill came to an astonishing $35 plus tax and tip. The roll was the least appetizing of all three, with an over-whelming amount of vinegar doused over the entire roll making the rice fall apart as I picked it up - plus everything tasted like vinegar and I could not taste the fish at all. The nigiri was okay, even though the portion of fish was tiny. The seafood salad was quite good, but when I inevitably compare it to similar offerings at other sushi bars around town, it seemed - well, small.

I was not very hungry, which explains the decision to go piece meal (so to speak), but after the three offerings from Kobe I was left feeling unsatisfied. If I had only paid $10 less and had the all-you-can-eat I would have at least been filled up - but at what cost?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Called to get hung up on. Tried to call again and was told \"well we are kinda busy right now\" okay I guess I won't be giving my money to you guys."}
{"text":"All you can eat heaven!  Love this place!!  Highly recommend the Cajun albacore sashimi!    Great service- great food!   Southwest location in a strip center-   Large enough for parties and groups!   Yelp for a free sake!!!!"}
{"text":"worst service at a sushi bar in las vegas, fish not that great, sushi chefs donot get the reason people sit at a sushi bar"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Houston, TX and this was one of the many local sushi spots in Vegas. The food was very delicious and the prices were affordable. We had a new waitress which happen to be her first day and she was doing a great job with the service. I recommend this place all my friends and family."}
{"text":"I had all you can eat sush.  Quality of fish was absolute horrible. They must buy all the left overs from the wholesalers. The ginger was so old it was mushy not crunch. Green tea was good(it's not included with buffet. It's $2.50). Miso soup was OK. Octupus salad was below average. Dinner hours, there was only two customers including me. I should have trust the yelp review of only 3 stars for the restaurant. Loll I learned"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for a month or 2 but noticed they started 50% off specials.

The issue I have with their 50% off specials is that their rolls are about 50% smaller in size & quantity & much less sauce.

Sorry, forgot to take pics before starting to eat but notice that size of tuna on top of this Red Dragon roll is slightly bigger than a thumb nail?
Many of the pieces were even smaller than this.

Maybe ok for AYCE or 50% off rolls price but not really a special! 
You decide.

Very misleading advertisement.

Service was also lacking as it seemed only one waitress vs 2 in the past.
I guess you also get 50% less service."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the lunch special 9.95 choice of 3 items. The sushi here is pretty good. I've never been disappointed. Sometimes the wait is a little long, especially if you're here during peak lunch times and only because it appears there's only one sushi chef working his ass off back there. Kudos to that guy!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with the map here, but Kobe is more around Flamingo and Fort Apache, not Durango. So we were called over to hit up their happy hour on a Friday night. What? Happy hour on a Friday night? Yeah, right. And not just late-night...they do happy hour every Friday and Saturday from 5pm to close, which I think is 1am. It doesn't really make sense to me, but whatever, it's cool. Their happy hour is a pretty good deal: half-off their entire menu. That being said, I was shocked at some of their prices, and there would be absolutely no reason to go here if it weren't for happy hour.

It's not that big of a place, but it was pretty poppin' when we were there. We were a party of 5...got two orders of seaweed salad, two orders of soft-shell crab, four special rolls, a tonkatsu don, and the fried banana with ice cream. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw the size of the seaweed salads, and the soft-shell crabs were even more of a joke. These guys were tiny. Now I know the different sizes of soft-shell crabs restaurants can order, and Kobe definitely just orders the cheapest available. No meat whatsoever, just fry and sauce. The four rolls we got were fine...nothing too bad, but nothing special either. The plates were cheap plastic. They were stingy with their sauces, and the extra ponzu sauce we asked for never came. The spicy tuna was definitely a darker color and kind of nasty looking, obviously pre-made and not fresh at all. The tonkatsu don's sauce was pretty tasty, but the tonkatsu was definitely soggy...not freshly fried at all. Again, obviously pre-made, probably sitting in the fridge and popped in the microwave prior to serving. Ugg. Dessert was fine, although I swear the green tea ice cream did not taste like green tea. It didn't taste bad or anything, but I oddly kept tasting some floral notes to it. Weird.

Most of their stuff was definitely overpriced, so with the 50% discount, you're probably paying about 2/3 of what it would be elsewhere at full-price. The special rolls start at $12, with most being around $14. I was shocked to see a $22 mango/salmon roll. I also saw $20 bentos. There was $3 mochi ice cream on the menu, but the picture definitely just looks like one single mochi ball split in four pieces, whereas an order of mochi elsewhere normally comes with two balls. I was probably most shocked with their drink menu. $6/8 for small/large import beers?? That's outrageous. The average price out there is $3.50/6.50. I also saw a 300ml bottle of premium sake for $22 that usually runs for $12-14. So basically they just try to fool you with their happy hour. You might be paying less than you would full-price at other places, but definitely not by much. And definitely not at another place with a nice promotion going on.

Service was also pretty crappy. Our waitress was nice enough, but we didn't know where she was half the time and always when we wanted something. We had to get another girl to take our dessert order and yet another girl to get our check. It was also fucking freezing in there. =\"}
{"text":"They have improved their service and they have a sweet lunch deal now. It is not the best I have ever had, but for the value and convenience it is good enough to keep going back. I have not been to sit down in quite a while, I will update when I do."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I don't like raw sushi. I like the cooked rolls and this is a Great sushi spot! They have a variety of sushi rolls. For those who are picky like I am, they have different options Cooked and raw. I tried the japanese lasagne roll and it was awesome and cheesy in a good way and I also tried the J Roll and WOW, that was my favorite. I enjoyed it very much and the service is good as well."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and the food is consistently good. The staff is friendly and attentive. The three item lunch or dinner special is a great deal."}
{"text":"Good service excellent price small cozy place perfect for a first date or chat with all friends!! Do go on Friday or Saturday happy hour is from 5 to midnight and is 50% off EVERYTHINHG!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Came on a Sunday night & it was quiet & enjoyable. Our rolls started coming out right away & the poki was really good ! Definitely will be back again !"}
{"text":"Soto was a really good chef and everything was great and we enjoyed our food and the fiod was delicious. Two thumbs up  for Soto ,thanks."}
{"text":"Amazing place in our neighborhood. We like to come for the lunch special all the time   3 items for only 10 dollar a person. 
The athmosphire is calm. The food is fresh and good and the price is right. 
5 stars. Easy."}
{"text":"The server was very friendly and attentive. I ordered miso soup, nigiri (salmon and albacore), Japanese lasagne and the Vegas roll. My favorite was the lasagne. 

The issue I had was that they brought everything out separately. Miso soup was brought out followed by the lasagne. The Vegas roll wasn't brought out until I finished the lasagne, followed by the nigiri. I prefer that they come out around the same time so I try them all and switch it up.

I thought there was more rice than I would have liked. 

Everything was fresh. 

The AYCE was $19.99 for lunch."}
{"text":"This place gets a bad rap, and I don't know why. It's a small place, but the quality is really good, so are the prices! Delicious and affordable. The nigiri is super fresh, I can't get enough. We moved to henderson and still make the drive when we can!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice to meet a friend for dinner.  It has an all-you-can-eat option, which is nice.  I'm always a little skeptical of Asian restaurants who don't have Asians working, especially when the sushi chef is not Japanese.  I'm also skeptical when there are no other Asian customers except for me.  Bad sign.  Fish is not very fresh.  Service is friendly and prompt, but not attentive (had to ask for napkins and missing sushi items)...except drink refills-my cup was almost always full without asking.

To satisfy a sushi craving when you're in the area, it's not a terrible place to stop...but next time I will suggest a different place to meet my friend for our sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Awl. It's a good place. I go friday nights when the food is half off and the sake is half off. That includes the sushi. The sushi guys are so fun. Sit at the bar if you can. I'm not a sushi eater but my boyfriend is. So he had me try the one with eel, crab, tuna, salmon and some with yumyum sauce (which lives up to it's name) I normally order the edamami and the fried tofu in the miso soup which is sooooooo good. Also we order saki bottle after saki bottle. And it's cheap. We bring our friends and we all leave under 15. That is we are all drinkers. So if you don't drink! It's cheaper!
A note though. Half off starts at 10. I reccommend you get there by then. I've shown up at 12 with no where to sit! The place is small! But quaint.
:)"}
{"text":"Great sushi.....cute atmosphere! Fresh food! A must try!  First time trying this restaurant and im always alittle skeptical when it comes to freshness, but this place was not short on service and the server was very pleasant and the food is so good!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place even thought I had read so many reviews which mostly are not really positive. 
Lucky me after shopping at Smith grocery store next door on Friday night. I just want something quick and easy and fortunately on Friday-Saturday night during 5pm-1am Kobe is having their Happy Hours 50% menu.
I ordered Shrimp fried rice, Bento box with Salmon Teriyaki and 2 nigiri sushi (Salmon and Squid)
The portion in each one was decent and I almost want to say \"large\". 

Anyone who reviewed this place and said they are overpriced for $20 Bento box must be on something. I would pay for $20 Bento but I was lucky to paid $10 during happy hours. 
My Shrimp fried rice was tasty and about 2 big bowls of rice. Shrimps were cut up in small pieces but I didn't mind for the price that I paid. I'm not so good at math... So I couldn't tell how many shrimps were in there. Carrot, mushroom, green onions and zucchini were fresh! 

My 2 nigiri were nice size, salmon piece was \"fat\" and squid piece was cut up \"pretty\" like they had made an effort. 

The music not too loud and over all I feel like it was a good value. 

Try out for quick and easy meal, specially on Friday and Saturday night"}
{"text":"It's awesome place! Good food good place get together... also they have till 31 may \" buy 3 all you can eat get 4th free!!! Its amazing"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for happy hour hands down! The eel rolls are my favorite and the shrimp tempura for sure. I always leave satisfied and the staff always make sure you're well taken care of  

Oh and try the green tea ice cream, it's the best."}
{"text":"So yeah... This is our last time coming. They let us order all you can eat then closed the kitchen. No cooked food.No a/c No fan. No music. Fine you are messing with the electricity..... but why on a Saturday Night at 9:30?????
Like the Raven....Nevermore."}
{"text":"This place has excellent quality sushi with great specials. The staff is friendly and attentive. I recommend to anyone that is looking for a good deal and good sushi."}
{"text":"I loved this place. My girlfriend and I would come every single month. We love the lunch and dinner specials. I would get two I miss you rolls and a Salmon skin salad every single time, while my girlfriend would get a miso, tamago, and I miss you. The service was always good. The food was always good. 

Until last night. My girlfriends family came to vacation, from Hawaii. They were in the mood for Japanese cuisine. At first, we went to Jjanga, not knowing they were closed for renovations. After seeing them closed, my girlfriend and I wanted to bring them to our favorite Japanese restaurant, Kobe. We wanted to boast to them and show them how good this place was. Unfortunately, that didn't happen last night.

We were a party of seven, including a baby. There were maybe two other parties -small parties-  in the entire restaurant, both seated in the back of the restaurant. We walked in, was greeted, and lead to a table in the front. Good sized table. It could definitely fit all of us without hesitation. As soon as we were about to sit down, one of the servers told the other server to have them sit in the back, near the other parties. Let me repeat myself, we were a party of seven. Mind you she was trying to sit us at a booth, with an extra chair at the end LOL. 

Let me try to paint the picture in your head. There were seven menus laid out on the table. Three on each side and one at the end. Are you still with me? Cool. Grandma and uncle sat down on one side. Myself and my friend sat down on the other side of the table. That's all who could fit at the table. LOL. To make matters worse, when we asked to be seated elsewhere cause we OBVIOUSLY could not fit on this child sized booth, you know what she told us? Try. Try... TRY to squeeze on this table. The best part is that while she was telling us this, she was also in the process of taking a table from another party, to give to us. This party wasn't even done eating, yet she had the audacity to try to take one of their tables to give to us. What in the actual fuck? Needless to say, we walked out and went to outback steakhouse after.

Three parties in the entire restaurant, ours the biggest, and we get sat at the smallest table in there? Yeah. No. What the fuck, Kobe? 

My family will not be returning here. My girlfriend and I will not be returning here. If I could give this no stars, I would. Goodness."}
{"text":"Went here for years and loved their sushi. The staff had gotten slow over the years and they can seem rude more times than none. I was upset when they put a one order limit on the soft shell crabs, but still came back until the staff issue got old for me. Food is still good but the service needs help."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this sushi bar. Not only is the staff friendly but the Happy Hour is AMAZING. Their Happy Hour is Friday and Saturday from 5pm to 1am. The special is 50% off everything on the menu including alcohol. You cant beat that. We usually get 2 or 3 rolls and a few drinks and never paid over $30, including tip. The best part of the menu being 50% off, is there are no exclusions and they dont skimp on the rolls. The only downfall lately is that the service slacks when they are busy. A few times we have went and had waited at least 30-45 minutes and still didnt get our complete order and ended up canceling a few of the rolls. Otherwise, definitely recommend Kobe Sushi next time your in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"I really love this place great service nice atmosphere . food is so fresh we love spicy ask Soto the wey you like it and he make it for you."}
{"text":"Kobe's is my go to spot when I'm craving sushi! Great food and great service! Best prices and staff in town"}
{"text":"Ok, this place . . . . it's my favorite, really truly is.  I've had no problems getting delicious, fresh food and there is nothing better than their happy hour!  

The last 2 or 3 times we've been there, the service downright sucked.  They were slow, unorganized and it seems like they do a team sort of drill so there are actually multiple people who will wait your table.  But yet . . . we still waited to reorder . . . and waited . . . and waited.  Then our second order came before my first order -- my beloved Kobe 2 -- after the waitress stopped by and said it should be coming shortly.  I waited forever for my Kobe 2 that was in toooo much sauce frankly, but still extremely delicious. 

If service were efficient and maybe friendly, I could bump this back up to a 5-star experience without much thought!"}
{"text":"This is my first review ever lol the place was empty when we came here which is perfect for us cause we got seated right away and there were 3 people helping us. The staff is friendly and very attentive and the food is pretty good. The best part is that we came during happy hour (after 9 pm) and it's $19.99 for all you can eat! This is definitely going to be a regular spot for us from now on."}
{"text":"I came to this place despite the mixed reviews.  And i have to say its pretty good. Service is always decent there prettt attentive. The food is good. Ive never been disappointed, always comes out in a timley matter. Always taste fresh, all there specialty rolls are very good."}
{"text":"This is a great place especially Jorge! Love the food . We come here all the time! It's our secret sushi place love it."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite sushi house. I was here last night with my friends because we were craving for sushi. The server(fae) and the sushi chef are so nice, funny and very friendly. We had an AYCE for $26.00. There's a lot of food to choose from. For the rolls dont forget to order their famous japanese lasagna(its bomb), ocean's three, carlito's way and rock and roll. And make sure to save room for those cute little mochis. 

Highly recommended and we'll definitely coming back. :)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing with great service and excellent chef . You guys should try this Japanese restaurant out . This is my first time and I will go back here again . Thank you"}
{"text":"Both my gf and I went there, ordered spicy tuna, dragon roll, cucumber roll, and I think the alshey roll. 3 hours later, both of our stomach hurts.  Had to use the bathroom more than u want to know.  Maybe it was just that day, but the interior of the place looks pretty cool and our waiter was great.  Would I go there again? Prob Not."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. I have been coming here with my family for three years and I have never been disappointed. This place has such good food and amazing prices! There Japanese Lasagne is the bomb dot com and it drives me crazy how good it is. I totally recommend this sushi bar!!!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi

Horrid service they forgot half the rolls took them 40 mins to make 4 rolls and was not busy taking excessively long times to bring out nonsushi items

Had to ask for refills on drinks. Will not come back"}
{"text":"This place is one of the greatest value there is in town. Food is excellent and service is great! Definitely worth checking if you haven't been and I would definitely come back more often. My new favorite roll is \"Hello Monkey\"!"}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite place but the food tonight was horrible. I don't know if they have new chefs but everything me and my friend ate was extremely bland just no flavor at all. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Had the philly roll, Washington roll, and the show me the money roll. Kate was the best server ever. She got me my food real quick and was on top of things. I would have given 5 stars but they were out of uni and toro by the time I got there (10pm). Solid 4 stars though."}
{"text":"Been eating here every Friday for the past few years & now ill never go back again.
Picked up my to go order (which took 45 minutes for 2 Rolls & 1 order of albacore)
The waitress said they were \"cooking\" my food still and u thought she was joking until u got home & the albacore was cooked! IT'S SUSHI!!!!!! Raw sushi COOKED! Ugh im never going back again"}
{"text":"We are disappointed to learn you cancelled your happy hour specials. We stopped in for dinner this evening and discovered that was no longer an option a chose to eat somewhere else. It was a nice alternative to the all you can eat special when you just are not all the hungry. 

Thanks you."}
{"text":"As many have done, we saw Kobe sushi bar while Smith's-shopping; hunger & curiosity  got us in the door... we were happy with quick courteous service, and very pleased with the lunch special.
Fresh, authentic, and light but filling....we will be back.
Good job!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little hole in the wall. It's been owned and operated by the same man for easily 10 years. The food is always great, service is speedy and the experience is always awesome. I love coming here. I have been a customer for 10 years and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"What a cozy place to eat delicious sushi, my 3rd visit....
super chill and relaxing with dim lights...
They have so much variety of sushis and some what funny silly names but ultimately delicious specially the Hot sushi you gotta try them I think one of them was the lasagne(weird for sushi) but OMG it was awesome! 
Very reasonable prices.
Clean atmosphere.  
Awesome fast service from the Japanese lady keep forgetting her name but super cool + Friendly and GREAT at suggestion delish sushi..."}
{"text":"We tipped them frugally. We ordered two things in the beginning that still haven't come yet & people have ordered water and it still hasn't arrived. They only gave us two menus when there were five of us in the beginning and there were a full stack of them at the front. I asked for a menu and had to wait 20 minutes for it and had to ask three different people for it and another one twice. They get 3 for their happy hour though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat sushi at, the service is always at its finest. The sushi taste so fresh, and well cooked/prepared every time. Happy hour is a must, the finest sushi for so little! I'll recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Konnichiwa, amigos!

I go to Kobe Sushi Bar for \"All you can eat sushi dinner special\" when I visit Las Vegas.  I just say it's just an \"Okay\" Japanese restaurant. This is a good place for HUNGRY students :) Their servers are friendly tho! :)

My parents visited me from Japan for my graduation in the last May, and I took them to Las Vegas for their new experience. I wanted to show them a Japanese food, especially sushi, so we went to Kobe Sushi Bar. Guess what? Yeah, my parents complained their sushi... LOL Oh well, well... I told them that \"we are not in Japan and we are in the United States now... please do not complain about sushi in Las Vegas...\" LOL Actually, they enjoyed having kinda different types of sushi and Japanese food! :)

Kobe Sushi Bar is more for local Vegas people. You can find this place easily with GPS, but it's kinda far from The Las Vegas Strip. So, Kobe Sushi Bar is not good for tourists... Sorry! But if you have a car or take a taxi, go ahead and Enjoy! :)

I am very picky about Japanese food. I always prefer to go to Japanese restaurants which are owned by Japanese make real Japanese tastes, NOT TOO Americanized Japanese food. This restaurant's owner is not Japanese,  so I have never seen any Japanese people in this restaurant during the dinner time... OUCH! :(

{"text":"I have been eating at Kobe Sushi for years. The food has always been excellent and today the food was great as well. The service of the sushi chef is what ruined my lunch today. I got the ayce today for lunch and it took 15 minutes between each roll to get the chefs attention. I would understand if he was busy but it was dead in here today and he was doing \"busy\" clean/prep work to avoid making eye contact. It was really as if he didn't want to be at work and thus ruined my lunch. Even though the food is good here, I will not waste my time or money on the place again!"}
{"text":"Came here after a day of being sick because I wanted Ramen but didn't want to drive too far.. Boy this was a fail on my part.

I asked if I could taste test tonkatsu vs miso ramen and the server explained I couldn't due to the broths being frozen... But he said it was so amazing and suggested miso.

Took my first bite and wasn't impressed.. Had to order chili oil and some dry seasoning to even out the taste.

My boyfriend decided to try all you can eat.
He ordered salmon sashimi and nigiri: salmon, yellowtail, super white tuna, and octopus. According to him, all were weird almost like two day leftover fish and he ended up ordering beer to chase these down, the only yummy one was the super white tuna.

He ordered the two most popular rolls and mentioned they tasted like Grocery Store sushi. 

For $25 AYCE... I should have just stayed sick in bed with $0.25 Instant Ramen and ordered pizza for the boyfriend."}
{"text":"First time being here and absolutely loved it. A MUST TRY and SOTO the chef is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday before heading to the store for the dinner special and ended up doing AYCE. When we arrived we were the third party inside but the only one not at the bar. The service started out fine but the hostess and the server seemed to be inexperienced and weren't really able to come back to us as much as we needed them, which isn't by itself that much of a big deal but when all the other tables are getting much more attention than us and we are waiting 10 minutes for one roll its a bit frustrating. We ordered baked green muscles as soon as we arrived and somehow they didn't come until our last rolls were arriving. When we were first seated I mentioned how I loved that Kobe has a sheet so that you always get what you ordered but was quickly disappointed when I was getting incorrect quantities of nigiri and some just never came. We really like the garlic Tuna and decided to order another and what we got was nothing like the first order and some of the other cuts of nigiri were way too thick. It seemed like there was one good sushi chef and the other one was his first day on the job. I'm never one to be extremely picky about service but having worked in the service industry and having had GOOD customer service at this location before I just had to post a review. I feel like one of the most basic things that you can do to provide good service is keeping beverages full and I was rather irritated I had to ask to have my water refilled (I had drank my girlfriends water as well)  although trivial it makes a big difference. I wish I could rate the staff individually and give the main sushi chef 5 stars everything that came from him was amazing I'd give the other guy 3 because it didn't even seem like he knew how to make nigiri but his rolls were good and I'd give the service staff 2 stars. And this was on a Tuesday at 730 with 2 tables sat when we left. Only reason I came here was because my aunt and cousin are regulars here but my cousins also expressed his frustration towards what could have been the same service staff we had. 2 stars only because of one sushi chef. 
Also one dessert order per customer kind of sucks when there a lot of places that only have the same rule but also offer things like green tea creme brûlée or mousses and tempura ice cream. But only one dessert on mochi or vanilla and green tea ice cream?! They should go to JJanga or literally any other sushi place and see how it should be done."}
{"text":"The prices here can be ridiculous... So it's always good to go during happy hour. Majority of the menu is half off. I always order the bento box which is only $10, without the happy hour it's $20. Not sooo bad... I guess. The whole place to me is eh. I come here once every two months or so."}
{"text":"What a complete rip off!

I ordered two dinner bento boxes at $20 each.  Each one did not come with a miso soup, had old lettuce for a salad, fake crab in the california rolls and dried salmon.  One of the worst values I have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing AYCE Sushi place. They even have sashimi as a selection although it is limited per person but they give you pretty large pieces and it's very fresh. They have such a huge selection of rolls and specials as well as Korean BBQ options and even a ton of things for kids to choose from like french fries, quesadilla, Fried rice and lots of other things. Love this place!
The only reason I took one star off is because of the service. If you want good service do not come here. They are nice enough but there just is a shortage of staff and so everyone is running around very stressed out and that also makes me question what goes on in the kitchen. But, the food is incredible nonetheless ."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, very tasteful. Very fast service. Strongly recommend this place. The salmon hand roll (turn the Washington roll in a hand roll) it's awesome. It comes with plenty of salmon. The other one that's great is the volcano roll, although it's cooked, it has a great taste."}
{"text":"Another stop on my mission to find the elusive SPICY CRAB Roll. 
Now, don't laugh. I am certainly not a sushi afficienado by any means, but I do know what I like, and it's SPICY CRAB. Not the soft shell variety, and not even the real king crab version either. Just plain ole kani kama crab mixed with Japanese mayo & Siracha hot sauce to make the same sort of mix used in California rolls (without the Siracha, of course). The SPICY CRAB roll I seek, contains this mixture, cucumber, nori and rice. Pretty simple..... But I have found that in the majority of sushi restaurants that I have visited in my many travels, there is no such thing as this sort of spicy crab roll. On the rare occassion that I find SPICY CRAB roll on the menu, it turns out to be a california roll with a splash of Siracha (then just call it a Spicy California Roll at that point). 

With that said.... I decided to try this location of Kobe, in search of the elusive SPICY CRAB roll. They had one on the menu. They were even willing to substitute 'spicy crab' for 'spicy tuna' on some select rolls I chose from their Happy Hour menu - which is 50% off the entire menu from 5pm to 1am on the weekends (we went on a Saturday evening). So I ordered with intent to share:
Red Rock Roll w/ Spicy Crab not just regular crab mix
Crazy Jalapenos w/ Spicy Crab not Spicy Tuna
2 Spicy Crab Rolls
Edamame
Miso Soup

All in all, the rolls I got were good rolls. Maybe it's something psychological that as soon as I recognize the 'line of Siracha' I seriously get bent out of shape because it seems like false advertising to me. This thought of being deceived. once again, just put a damper on wanting to order anything additional (I have a limited palate when it comes to sushi).

Overall:
- Price - 5 Stars. The Happy Hour pricing of 50% off the entire menu from 5pm to 1am is a huge plus for us. We aren't huge AYCE eaters so this option made more sense for us in our dining.

- Service = 3.5 stars, they were super busy but we had to remind the server a couple of times, that others at my table were missing their orders.

- Ambiance - 3.5 stars. It's a bit of a small place but it accomodating. A little loud as there was music and 4 (i think) televisions. the televisions mostly stay turned down and tuned to different programs.

We might make it back for the happy hour on the weekend, if I can ever get over the idea that they took the lazy way out and made a spicy piece of nori and added the crab on top."}
{"text":"Great place! Best Mexican roll ever. Good customer service would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Update,  starting going to this location more because of location and convenience. I have to say the staff has stepped their game. Staff is always very pleasant and helpful. 
I recommend  you utilize the  happy hour,  happy hour is 50% off. The price is good already but with happy hour pricing it's amazing value. 
The sushi at this location is top notch, always fresh and delicious. I recommend the wet dream and the s.s.s. roll."}
{"text":"I've been eating here with my boyfriend and his family for almost 2 years now and thought it was about to time to write a review! 
WE LOVE this place. We don't go anywhere else for sushi . The hostesses and servers are always nice and helpful ; Chef Soto & Leo are amazing ! 
If I could recommend one roll it would be Oceans Three , the ponzu sauce here is like no other. 
They have amazing specials - I can't eat much so the three item is perfect for me : 2 rolls and an appetizer. There is also All You Can Eat !! 
We aren't planning to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Yuck Where do I start?? First the service was mediocre. I used to come here all the time for years and never had a problem until tonight. Everything was just bland. The fried avocado roll and the Japanese lasagne were terrible. This place used to be good. I was excited to come here after seeing they brought back the 50% happy hour on the weekends. We tried the green tea cheesecake and it was disgusting tasted old and hard. Don't come here"}
{"text":"great food along with great food! enjoyable music. good came out quickly thank goodness ahaha. totally recommended it!"}
{"text":"Best dinner specials around! Appetizer and two rolls (specialty rolls included) for under $15"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time. The prices are great and the staff is always friendly. I like the $9.99 3 item combo lunch option. And of course the all you can eat.
I love getting the 007 and coco roll. I always ask for the spicy garlic ponzu sauce to dip my sushi in with of course lots of wasabi! And I love the nigiri items.  Nom Nom nom
Wish they would offer half rolls for the AYCE so that way you can try more of what the menu offers. 
Haven't really tried anything from the regular menu. But my mom says they have great bento boxes when you are not in the mood for just sushi."}
{"text":"My fiance and i have become regulars here to the point where they know we dont use our wasabi and ginger and they remember we always get a side of spice ponzu instead. The food has never disappointed. The staff is super friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for salads and a couple rolls but instead of going to our usual place, Naked Fish, we decided to try a new place. We were hoping Kobe Sushi would be good since it's close to the house but we were pretty disappointed!
For what it is the prices are a little high if you're planning on ordering a la carte so I suggest you go elsewhere.. We both decided to get the AYCE ($23.99) since it would basically add up to that much anyways..

I noticed the AYCE menu is pretty limited compared to other places so that was the first red flag... Next they don't offer uni or fresh scallops for AYCE.. They were also out of oysters and halibut.. They do however offer sashimi (2 pieces per person) but they are cut very small. Our first plate of nigiri tasted ok but everything after that did NOT taste fresh.. Ugh nothing worse than raw fish that tastes like raw fish LOL They put a lot of rice on the nigiri too and I noticed my rice kept falling apart which made it hard to eat.. I liked that they had soft shell crab on the menu (it's small though) and I enjoyed their sweet shrimp nigiri but the shrimp heads were under-fried.. 

The waitress and busser were nice but the food took FOREVER to come out ...even though we were 1 of 3 parties in the restaurant.. The sushi quality just wasn't good. I didn't even ask if they had a stamp card so it's safe to say I probably won't be back here ;[[[ 


HOT TIP: They have Happy Hour (50% off the menu) on Fridays & Saturdays after 5:00~"}
{"text":"This is a cute and intimate feeling type of sushi restaurant with affordable pricing and good service."}
{"text":"Came to check this place out the other day.. the restaurant had 3 other guess there.. I waited 45 mins for one roll!! My jalapeño poppers came put cold !! It was frozen.. I asked 3 different times why the food is taking so long.. my server was absolutely amazing very sweet woman.. I asked to speak to the owner.. HORRIBLE customer service. We couldn't even eat our food. We explained the situation to him and he say there and didn't say anything.... he treats his employees so bad. He pulled them aside and was so rude and disrespectful. I will never go back and I will make sure my friends don't either. Save yourself some time and money and go to smiths"}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant we just wanted a few rolls, they had no uni, no giant clam, and others I forget. They charge $2.00 for tea. The sushi is mediocre at best. With all the good sushi places here why would anybody come here. (we were the only people here @ 6:30pm on 7/31/2013"}
{"text":"Never ever gonna dine here again. I went here to have dinner with a group of friends and as a server i think they need to be nice... the server had no manners. While i was eating her arm was hitting my face while she puts the food on the table. Every time i'd order something the server didn't look happy and i felt like i was giving her a hard time when all i wanted was another roll of sushi. She didn't want to split the checks (maybe cause she was lazy) ! the friends that i had dinner with works in the F&B industry that they never had issues splitting the checks. it just doesn't make sense. 

I wish i got the Filipino lady's name who has been rude to us the entire time. 
never again. Food was pricey and I've tried better sushi!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice atmosphere at the bar, and I've always had fresh fish here. Been coming for years."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh boy... I really should know by now but yet I still give places another chance months later just to see if they've improved or anything.  I have been to this place before but it was a long time ago, so I figured I'd try it again.  As soon as I sit down, for my all you can eat sushi experience I see the paper to order from, and for those of you that have read my prior reviews I HATE ordering from the paper forms (Lahaina, Kobe Sushi and yoko hama sushi.  So let's get on with the review..

I place my first order and part of it includes 2 hand rolls. As soon as I give the sushi chef my order, the server took it off the counter to \"review it\" (why I don't know) and highlights my order as a hand roll.  I get part of my order and then I get a roll handed to me and it's not my 2nd hand roll that I ordered. He made it into a cut roll.  The server forgot to highlight the 2nd item to indicate that.  Lahaina grill made this mistake SEVERAL times on my order.  This mistake wouldn't have happened if I ordered directly with the sushi chef.  I really wasn't happy at all.  The quality was ok at best, food was rather slow and of course I get to the part where I like to order uni and as expected (because I just knew he was gonna tell me this) they're OUT OF UNI .  I asked about ama ebi (sweet shrimp) they're out of that too. I actually gave him a fairly dirty look at that point.  He said they get their order in on Thursday.. Hmmm well today was Sunday.  So you didn't even order enough to get you through til your next order??? Yea well I know that's not really the case. They just don't want to serve it. 

This place was avg in quality, POOR in service and my record stands that any sushi bar that you have to order from on paper typically ends up with a poor experience.  

I don't plan on goin back anytime soon.  There are FAR better sushi bars in vegas. Please drive past this one..."}
{"text":"Solid consistent sushi and great service.  Bottom line you can't get a better deal than their Lunch and Dinner specials.  One appetizer or nigiri order and two special rolls for $9.99 (or $13.99 for dinner).  The all you can eat is also reasonably priced and everything is delicious."}
{"text":"We just order the Ramen to go and it is very good.  The sushi bar is attractive and the decor is nice."}
{"text":"I immediately got really sick after eating at this place and I will not go back there. The service was OK but not sure about the quality of fish considering I got sick."}
{"text":"Wow, I was a little surprised at all the negative reveiws of this place. I have been eating here for over 5 years (regularly) and feel like I've really seen it grow from a baby..lol.. And I have only had one bad experience the entire time I have been going. I have gotten to know the owner and chefs and they are great! I love that they have just what I want... I have gone to other places and it was so difficult to get something I like : ( 

 I was just here last night and it was probably the best meal I have had there yet! Service was amazing! (they have lacked in that department sometimes but I think they are getting together). It is definitely not a cheap meal by any means but I have seen people go to Sushi Fever and spend over $150 for three people! It is way less expensive here and I think the food is way better anyway. 

I think the fact that I have been to this place like a hundred times shows that it is pretty good lol : )"}

Not sure why this spot has any poor reviews I've been back 4 times and the service has always been stellar.  Ask for Dax, his rolls and sushi cuts are pro status . . .this guy trained with serious Japanese sushi masters and worked in some of the best sushi joints on the strip.  He chats up his customers, gets to know them and tailors the rolls to you.  Sit at the bar.  Give Kobe sushi a shot, you won't regret it."}

Very prompt and delicious"}
{"text":"Kobe used to be my favorite sushi spot in Vegas. It was a hidden gem with friendly sushi chefs and wait staff, and a great 50% of happy hour menu on Friday and Saturday nights. I've been going to Kobe for almost 7 years.

But over the course of the last year, my experience at Kobe has been steadily going down hill. The staff has turned over almost 100%. And instead of focusing on sushi/shashimi/nigiri, the menu has way over expanded to include items such as french fries. You also need to keep notes on what food items are on special and when, as the deals are constantly changing. But none of those reasons have stopped me from going to Kobe

What is going to make me chose other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas over Kobe is based on my last few experiences....the lack of cleanliness. The tables are sticky, the menus are dirty with soy sauce and food stuck to them, food carts with dirty dishes is stored in the hallway to the bathrooms, and the restaurant smells like sewer. Today when I visited Kobe, the sewer smell was overwhelming the second I walked through the front door. And to cover up the smell, the employees periodically pumped air freshener through the restaurant. I don't know which was more unappetizing....the sewer smell or the cheap air freshener bathroom smell throughout the the restaurant.

Again, I used to really like Kobe, but I will not be returning until things are significantly cleaned up."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS SUSHI BAR. Aside from it being extremely convenient for me and my friends, I have always had a positive dining experience here.

We usually come fo their Friday night Happy Hour, which is from 5pm til closing (kitchen closes at 1:30 am I believe). Everything is 50% off! How can you go wrong??

Personal favorites: J roll and Ryan Patrick roll.

I also need to add that the tempura ice cream dessert is HEAVENLY. 

This place is seriously dangerous for me. When I crave sushi, I crave this place. And let me tell you, my sushi cravings happen often!"}
{"text":"Let's just say it and be clear: Friday 50% happy hour. 

The service was stellar! The place was hopping so my friend and I sat at the bar rather than wait for a table. We were immediately offered beverages and given our wooden trays for our impending sushi order. We ordered some soup and cucumber salad and took a look at the menu. Soon after we placed our order her first roll came out. Fast service with a smile! 

That service, the happy hour, and the Rock n' Roll (see below)? Best part of the evening.

All in all I believe she ordered the Michael Lui, Dynamite, Rock n' Roll (cucumber wrap, no rice), and spicy tuna.

The spicy tuna was average. Not amazing, but not bad. Even knowing that they have to make it ahead of time, my view from the bar showed a massive container of the stuff and, while it tasted OK, there's something about watching it scooped from a half-gallon size container and spread on your rice. It just isn't appetizing. The flavor *was* fine, the texture *was* fine. Overall it was just that. Fine.

The Dynamite was not dynamite. It was mushy. It didn't have enough of the sauce/topping and it had too much of the residual juices from the cooking of the onions and mushrooms. The scallops were OK-ish, if not a little overcooked. I have had much, much better at much worse places. Not at all a fan.

The miso soup was average and a little on the cool side. The cucumber salad was... well, it was OK. I prefer the cucumber to be more thinly sliced, and I had a few pieces that were not peeled enough. However, the vinegar \"dressing\" was good and it popped the fresh cucumber nicely.

The Michael Lui was  a really tasty combination, although there was too much of the sauce and too much of the crunch garnish. Complementary in flavor, but it made it a bit wet and mushy towards the end. I would order this again without all the extra crunch and less sauce.

I *really* enjoyed the Rock n' Roll (and, as I don't eat a lot of rice, enjoyed that there was an option without it). The cucumber was fresh and crispy, the fish was tender and flavorful, and the presentation was nice. The sauce was placed on the side; we could decide how much, if any, we wanted. I appreciated that quite a bit.

We began chatting with a young lady sitting next to us who shared with us her Spider Roll. She said she liked it but couldn't finish it. I found it very dry and had to try it with some of the sauces we had. Not enough spider, way too much roll.

Let's repeat: Happy Hour. During the 50% special, our entire bill was less than $40. This and the service *would* have earned a third star but, meh, the rest just can't stand up enough for me to put it on there."}
{"text":"Overall, great experience.  Stopped in for lunch and the lunch special good value for the money. Food and service was good, the only request I would have is to have a little bit stickier rice it fell apart in the rolls."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great lunch special on sushi and Korean food. My favorite is Squid Topping Rice. This dish has enough protein and spice. I am definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. Ordered soup to start and never got that. Server also forgot orders and when we tried to order the rolls she forgot, they did not come. Had to ask a third time and finally got them. She never checked back and it seemed like she did not want us to order more even though we paid for ayce. The presentation of the food was also bad. Never returning here again."}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambience and the food is good and not too expensive.  The waitress was very nice and knew the menu well. Unfortunately,  the ramen was not quite as good as the specialty ramen houses in town but the sushi is very fresh."}
{"text":"Chill, hole in the wall sushi place. Their happy hour is pretty sweet: Fri and Sat 5p-1a...50% off everything. They have a huge selection of items and rolls. Tons of creative rolls that you wouldn't see at your typical hole in the wall sushi places. The \"I miss you roll\" is fantastic! They have tons of spicy options too, like the habanero salsa."}
{"text":"I love sushi and when trying new places I am always afraid because the auce is not that cheap and you want to feel like you got your money's worth or at least some good food.
I was craving sushi after just getting out of the hospital and I have to say I was disappointed. They have a bunch of items your only allowed to get one of. Items that other places let you have as much as you want.
This was one of those times for 3 of us to eat for over $80 and none of us happy with what we ate! That's pretty sad. A lot of the sauces did not taste like other places that call it the same name. 
This is why I don't like trying places I have never been to or read reviews about. I should have seen by some of the pictures people posted they were not happy.   There is not a lot of choices if you don't want a lot of rice.  None of us would go back here and we don't recommend if your looking for really good auce there are so many other places that beat this hands down!"}
{"text":"I've given this place a few chances but today was the last time I will ever go. Every time I go there there's always some sort of issue whether it's my rolls falling apart and not even being rolls, or miscommunication finding out that something is not available because somebody gave wrong information the time before, etc. this place needs a lot of work. Nobody is on the same page, every time I go in there they tell me something different about one of their specialty rolls one time it's available the next time it's not available on the lunch special. The only thing they've got going for them is that the lunch special is there cheap, but you have to wait 20 minutes for it then when you come back to pick up your order they tell you it's going to be another 20 minutes because the original order you put in has a role on it that is no longer available on the special, not telling you this of course before hand because nobody knows what's going on. Never going there again go somewhere else. If the review is removed I will just repost."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 5 times and the only thing that brings me back is the fact that I have gift certificates to use from Restaurant.com. I have one more GC left and I wont be using it again. The fish and rice is not fresh. Mushy mush mush!!! I ALWAYS have to ask for wasabi and napkins. EVERY time they give me a hard time about using the coupon. Its annoying and the food is just not worth it. There are so many better places to choose from. This one is also overpriced for such bad food. Don't bother..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the place has really gone downhill. For starters, when you walk in you're greeted by the stench of sewage, but not by anyone else. My friend and I came for lunch, and requested all you can eat. I placed our order by writing it down on the sheet they provide. I ordered 2 nigiri, 6 rolls, 3 green mussels, and a miso soup. We received 2 green mussels, 4 rolls, and the miso soup. I'm not sure if the rolls are actually not fresh or my senses were being tainted by the horrible smell. After waiting at least 25 minutes I asked the waitress why we hadn't received the rest of our order. She talked to the owner, and he gave me a dirty look as if was being ridiculous for asking about my order. He then proceeded to talk about us to the other sushi chef. After my other order finally came out, the owner just stared at me while I tried to eat the lukewarm mushy roll, making me feel extremely uncomfortable. The waitress, who is clearly new, was very nice and very apologetic about the bad service. Very disappointed as this used to be one of my go to sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I love this sushi place ! Soto is the best of the best ! You guys need to come try it and if you ever get to  sit at the bar and ask for extra love. He won't disappoint !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Skip the sushi and stick to cooked food and rolls.

We had just come from watching a movie and were starving. We were looking for some quick and cheap grub and I remembered this Kobe location that was near us. I have been to the one on Rainbow on numerous times, but this was my visit here. I knew they have a Happy Hour that pretty much lasts all day, so it made our decision easy. 

The restaurant was pretty empty, but filled up while we were there. I took quite a while perusing the menu. The entire menu is half price during Happy Hour I decided on bento box since it seemed like the best value. My fella ordered some rolls and appetizer as did our friend. My other friend decided on a bento box as well. 

Our food came quickly. The portions were large and I was happy with most of the cooked things in my bento box. The katsu was pretty good and not overcooked, the salad was pretty fresh as well. My fella didn't enjoy his rolls so I ended up trading a majority of my bento box for his roll since I liked it better than he did. The spicy tuna was spicy but not as fresh and fell apart quite easily. The sashimi was not fresh at all. The flavor was really fishy and I ended up not eating this portion of my meal. My friends and fella were pretty meh about the dining experience as well. The prices were right, but I don't think I'll be back to this Kobe location."}
{"text":"Pretty good deal, food was great and better they have French fries for my kid that doesn't eat sushi. My favorite spot to have sushi lunch!"}
