{"text":"The first Indian restro I tried after moving frm Seattel 6 months ago, even today it's my top list for a perfect lazy Sunday lunch. Lunch buffet is a totally value fr money. 
Today on mothers day, I was here and food was amazing and taste like home. The chicken and fish appetizers was super yammy, the south Indian varities wer good. Being frm Hyderabad, biryani has a standard to meet and biryani today was close to it :p . 

Taste: 4.5/5
Service : 5/5
Ambiance : 3/5

Note: Service is amazing, if you don't like anything tell them, they will fix it or at least improve it."}
{"text":"We had been to this bistro for a Sunday lunch in February. We were a group of five. It was an impromptu decision for us to try out this new place, and trust me we still repent that. We were driving from the eastern part of Cleveland, so we called up the restaurant that we will be reaching around 2.30pm. They replied that they have buffet and they welcome guests for lunch till 3pm. We reached the restaurant at around 2.20pm. Before we were seated, my husband just peeped on the buffet spread and saw ALL the trays to be almost empty. He inquired with the waiter whether they will be refilling the trays as we were a group of five. The person  confidently replied 'YES, please be seated'. There were around 15-20 customers already having lunch. I would now share the aftermath.

We started with samosa chaat and batora with mix veg. curry. When we went back for the main course the trays were literally empty, with no biriyani (they were serving both chicken & goat biriyani and both were empty) and goat curry with no  meat pieces. We requested for  refill and waited. After sometime they brought a bowl of goat biriyani (which can hardly serve 4-5 people). Since everyone was waiting for the refill, suddenly there was a rush from all the tables and by the time I reached there I just got to scrape some rice from the tray. I myself went to the counter to request for another proper refill. It was around 2.45 pm. After a while they came with dry chicken tikka masala but no rice item. I went to try the tikka masala, they were all half cooked. One of our friends then again requested for some biriyani refill, they asked us to wait. When our waiter came to refill our glasses of water, we told him that we were waiting for the biriyani to be served. He replied, it is already 3 pm, and lunch buffet is closed for the day. We were like, WTF! We hardly had anything. They were like waiting for the clock to strike 3, so that they could say 'Time Up'. For very obvious reasons we were super frustrated, and tried to convey the same to the waiter and he said he would call the manager. The manager came after a while. He said usually they have 100 customers for lunch on Sundays but that day it had exceeded 140 and they were not prepared for that unprecedented rush. He was not sorry precisely, rather he said if we can sit for another 30minutes he would be able to serve us chicken biriyani. It was already 3.20 pm, we neither had mood or appetite left to try out their biriyani anymore. 
They tried to compensate their fault by charging us for 3 instead of 5. That does not justify the way they treat customers.

I would like to ask: WHY on earth they were welcoming guests when they were well over their threshold?? This is like pinnacle of incompetence in handling guests and unprofessionalism. 

I can't talk about how their food taste like because we did not get a chance to try them properly. I had to put 1Star because there were not any provision to put lesser."}
{"text":"This is one of the pathetic restaurant in the town. 

Worst Service:-I ordered chicken biryani for take away and they took my order over the phone. I went to pick up after 30 minutes of placing the order and yet I had to wait for another 40-45 minutes. My advice to Dakshin Staff, If you did not had the Biryani you shouldn't take order from customer. They accepted my order and after reaching only they said we have Dakshin Special Biryani at the same price $12.99. Dakshin will never say no to your order and offer you something weird just to make money.

Terrible Taste:-About the Biryani I can only say it was one the worst Biryani's I ever had. For the name of Dakshin Special Biryani, they mixed chicken curry and rice along with pickle spices. We were not able to eat even half box. 

Overcharge :- They said $12.99 per box, but they charged me $14.99 and that's what appearing in my credit card statement. No tip was given by me as it was take away order. So basically they are cheating customer as well. 

This is not my first and last experience with terrible food quality of Dakshin. I went there for couple of times and experienced same bad quality food. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Our group of four planned to eat at Udupi before going to a show at Cassidy Theater last Saturday, and were surprised to find it under new management and renamed Dakshin. Not much changed inside and only two tables occupied.
Sat at a booth at 6:35, had our orders placed by 6:40 (naan for four, three Chicken Tikka Masala and one Butter Chicken). Sat and waited until 7:10 when two orders of Chicken Tikka Masala were brought to the table. After five minutes we decided to share the orders while waiting for the rest. At 7:25 the Naan was brought out with two orders of Butter Chicken. There was no time to have the order corrected before our 8pm show, so we just continued sharing out what had been served. The entrees were very good but half of the Naan was only partially cooked and doughy.
It's a shame that the service has so dreadfully eroded with new management. We likely won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"I was very excited when they opened it in Cleveland as I tried their Columbus location a year ago which was really good. But within few attempts I realized that this is one of the worst Indian restaurants in the area. Poor service and wait times are very long. Biryani quality is no way comparable to any of the restaurants in the area and often it tasted worse. They call it Paradise Biryani but it's not Biryani at all as it feels like curry mixed with rice. This is one of the first Indian restaurants I've been to that didn't serve Naan even though it's on the menu. Orders were messed up multiple times during the dine-in and take out. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. 

Taste: 2 out of 5
Quality: 1 out of 5
Service: 0 out of 5"}
{"text":"Daksin continues to be my favorite Indian restaurant for wide variety of Indian dishes and different spices. Mr Jagan Mohan is a very personable man and ensures my family has a great time. The service is very good and they attend to all my concerns. Will continue to support Dakshin.
Thx

{"text":"Mixed feelings about the place. Food is definitely good if you are looking for South Indian. Would not order the North Indian food at the place! Also felt the service and ambience could be a lot better."}
{"text":"Poor hosting. None cares if you walk in and you gotta wander around I bet. They clean and vacuum the floor while we were having food, that's most ridiculous. That oldie manager got some renovation going on while customers were having food, that's sick. Biryani is good though."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. The floors although wooden have holes in them. There is no host. We were seated and had to wait 5 minutes to menus, silverware and had to ask for water glasses. When we were seated there was a water jug from the previous people who must've sat at the table we were sitting. There was only 1 waiter who was serving 4 tables and was very slow. Took 20 minutes for our food to come and they forgot to bring out the dosas. As much as the food is good the ambiance needs much improvement. Looks like renovations were being done and are incomplete. They didn't have any music on to liven the atmosphere. No one came to check on to see how everything was once the food had arrived. I asked for less spicy food and the head chef cane and said its not possible. In my opinion this isn't a restaurant I'll be visiting again unless they make some improvements!!"}
{"text":"This is one my go to places when I crave for Indian food.. I have been here quite a few times and this place never fails to surprise me.."}
