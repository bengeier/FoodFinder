{"text":"Well, that was disappointing. After reading so many good reviews we thought we'd give it a try. Went for pick up since we were already out and about.    The good:  Service was great! So friendly! the stir fried vegetables were great. Lots of tasty veggies and perfectly cooked. The honey garlic spareribs were AWESOME (almost soggy but not quite)  The bad:  SOGGY ginger beef stung the back of my throat w the sauce (no idea why). Just a total bummer.  Forgot to say no MSG and now feel sick and puffy and itchy.   Probably stick to our local so-so Chinese in the next neighbourhood over from now on."}
{"text":"Great prices, great food, wonderful owners! I always order pick up and it's always ready within 10 minutes. Every dish I (as well as my friends and family) have tried, we have all loved.   The vegetable chow mein is my favorite dish, I have never had such fresh chow mein noodles before!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Sizzling Rice Peking House for the first time.  Our usual place has changed hands and we were on the lookout for a replacement.  The service was great, the food was even better.  Looking forward to taking out again in the near future."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! Ordered for pick up and it was ready in ten minutes. We ordered combination plates and were more than pleased with all of our choices."}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise to find this hidden gem so close to my house. The restaurant is very clean and the owners were extremely friendly. We tried the ginger beef, mu shu pork and chicken chow mein. All were so delicious we couldn't stop eating! I highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"Decided to try Sizzling Rice after I moved into the neighborhood. After the place I usually went too closed, I was trying to find a good replacement, I was glad that I did! They are really good priced  and the food was excellent. The couple that runs the place are great and very friendly. I love their ginger beef!"}
