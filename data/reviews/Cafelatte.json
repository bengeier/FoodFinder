{"text":"Good coffee, friendly workers.  Much much better then the previous owners brew."}
{"text":"Their coffee quality has significantly gone down over the past year and now I sometimes don't even finish my drink, even though I usually only get a grande. I'm not even sure if they serve illy coffee anymore since they just use regular cups now...they probably don't which is why it's no good anymore. I still find myself coming here because I work next door and it's convenient to just come here versus driving to Starbucks. They have pretty decent breakfast sandwiches and bagels but that's all I've really had here, so I can't comment on any of the other pastries. The lady here is nice if you get to know her, otherwise you probably wouldn't agree. They will also validate your parking if you buy something"}
{"text":"So here is the update! The staff here is really nice and the coffee is good. Service has sped up (hence the bump up in stars!)  I have also tried their chicken caesar salad for lunch and it was good as well. (Got it as a lunch special and the price is really good!) 

Overall, happy with this place. Hope they stay around for a while! :)"}
