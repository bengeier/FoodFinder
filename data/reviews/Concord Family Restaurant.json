{"text":"Holy food coma! Decided to go here because they advertised having 4 homemade soups daily, and was not disappointed. I decided to get the buffalo ranch chicken bites (they're an appetizer), because I didn't want to have leftovers, with the soup and salad bar. I was so wrong, the portion sizes here are MASSIVE. I took them as leftovers and shared them with my coworkers the next day. The sausage and pierogi special was also insane (in a good way)! The salad bar was stocked and fresh, and yes they had 4 soups!! The chicken Florentine soup was super yum!! 

Also, the place is super cute inside, and all the staff members were very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Driving thru and we were looking for a place to stop for dinner. Found good reviews on Yelp. Decided to try. 

The big thing on the reviews was the soup and salad bar. So that's what I honed in on. I ordered that. The salad bar is not huge but it has a decent variety of stuff. The soups there are 4 were really good. The size of the bowls were decent too. Better than a cup not as good as a full bowl. 

My partner got the stuffed cabbage. 2 huge pieces, mashed potatoes, and mixed veggies. Plus the soup and salad bar. It was a giant portion. I snagged a bite and it was delish. But so much food! She had to take most of it home. We also got a free dessert because she got an entree special. We split the rice pudding. Again delish. 

Our server was Michelle. It was her 3rd day. She was very helpful and friendly. We would definitely go back when in the area again. No hesitation. 

Good food at a great price! Can't ask for better than that."}
{"text":"Really nice family restaurant.  The food was very yummy and the portions were large.  I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and was not disappointed.  Tori was our waitress and she was very friendly and efficient.  We are planning to come back to try breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is good salad bar is what drew us to trying it, i can say i wish small non- corporate places should really try to do more of their foods made in house not frozen or premade like chains do. Overall its a reasonable priced place with good portions."}
{"text":"Food was good service was good, friendly, but rather slow establishment was very clean  I'll go again sometime. Don't live realy close although it's not to far but between my workplace and home and there there are just soooo many restaurants in mentor now it's overwhelming. Mentor has changed so much since I lived here years ago! But it's still nice and so much better than where I used to live!"}
{"text":"Great food very quick and very reasonable prices. Also food was hot and fresh!the staff is on point and very clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"This is a family style restaurant with a big, big menu. Everything pretty much seemed food service type quality. I don't think they are cooking much from scratch in the kitchen. We were there for dinner. Maybe breakfast would be homemade. 

The place was PACKED when we got there at 6:45ish on a Saturday night. Everyone coming and going seemed very happy with the new restaurant. The crowd was majority older retired age clientele. All the dinners came with soup and salad bar, a bread and desert. The dinner prices ranged from $10-$15. They had chicken dishes, steaks, seafood, Italian pastas, ribs, meatloaf, perogies, pot pie, etc. Our party ordered a BBQ rib dinner, the ribeye and the salmon. Those each came with a potato and vegetable, bread, soup, salad and dessert and our bill including tax was $41. You get a lot of average quality food for a low price. 

The staff seemed very attentive to everyone and were quite friendly and welcoming. 

I didn't make it into these restrooms, but the restaurant looked clean except for the floors. Those I blame on the self serve soup and salad bar. I'm not a fan of them in the first place and they tend to be difficult to keep clean as diners overload their plates and drop food everywhere. 

Definitely if you're on a budget and want to go out for a big meal, you will find what you're looking for here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful fish fry this evening!  Fresh hot and delicious.   Full salad/soup bar all you can eat fish & shrimp 10.99.  Can't beat it.  Thank you Charlie for your friendly and efficient service!  Thumbs up to the chef for taking special care of Dave who has allergies.  We will most definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving around today and decided to stop in for lunch.  It was our first time here and we will be back.  Staff is very friendly with the customers and with each other, which is nice to see.  We each got the soup and salad bar and he also ordered a BLT.  Wedding soup was delicious!  The salad bar selection was good and fresh.  The BLT was huge and he struggled to eat it all (and he can eat a lot!). As we were leaving they were setting up for a party of 21, so word must be out about what a nice place this is.  I like to go to local places, not chains all the time.  I wish good luck for this newer restaurant that they will be around for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Good Food,Large portions,Friendly Staff.
They offer a salad bar.
The All you can eat Sunday Brunch is the way to go.
I'll be back often. Best \"Diner\" in lake county."}
{"text":"Family had breakfast here a couple days ago for the first time, and it is a nice diner. Perfect for a family, nice name - family restaurant! The food was tasty and well prepared. Our server was friendly and helpful. I would definitely try it for lunch or supper. Just a nice solid diner."}
