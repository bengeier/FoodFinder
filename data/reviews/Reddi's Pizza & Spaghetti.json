{"text":"Good pizza with a lot of cheese and they were heavy on the ingredients. Was very good for pizza close to an airport. Delivery was very quick and arrived very hot. Price a bit high but a medium easily feeds two adults."}
{"text":"The food is ok, it used to be better. The prices seem to be a little out of wack with the food, considering that what they consider a large specialty pizza is actually a small pizza. I used to love Reddi's but now consider it to be overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"The food task like ass.......and over price... Customer service suck.... What a joke never again I'll buy food here"}
{"text":"Born and raised in Brook Park, Reddi's Pizza has been a house hold name for years. Living in NC now and traveling the word with the Army, Reddi's Pizza is still the best pizza around"}
{"text":"I'm from NY so my standards for pizza are high- this is the first place I've gone where it could rival a pizzeria from my hometown. Their specials are pretty great too. Got my bang for my buck along with amazing food!"}
{"text":"Greatest pizza on the planet. When i come home from the West Coast i order 2 XLs as soon as i get off the plane. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"How do you say perfect pie without alliteration? Reddi's set to go! Yeah that was bad,  but my pizza was great.  I ordered an extra large deluxe for the road.  The ingredients were fresh, flavorful and the finishing touch was hand formed sausage discs amply placed throughout the pie, not some preformed cubes and crumbles out of a bag from Arkansas. The crust was cooked to perfection   so my pups were dismayed at how little crust I sent their way. Good pie, fast, friendly service,  I will be back again.  Amy J, maybe you should go to Wall Mart and get a 10 pack of totinos factory pies if you are bargain hunting... Large is really a small? Come on now...."}
{"text":"Good small pizza place.  They are delivery/takeout place.  The pizza has good crust, baked to golden brown.   The sauce is homemade slightly sweet.   You may want to go extra cheese if you like pizza gooey with cheese.  Nicely done pizza.   They have special with spaghetti by bucket. Several sandwich options.   If you're close by try it.  Beats the chain options here"}
{"text":"While staying in Ohio, had the opportunity to taste Reddi's pizza.   Wow wowza!  Chunks of ham !  Real chunks of ham - not slices of lunchmeat!   Tasty!"}
