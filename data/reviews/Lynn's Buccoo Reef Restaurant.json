{"text":"A nice little restaurant nestled between a industrial area in Brampton (In the same plaza as Minar Indian Buffet). Definitely a hidden gem at the moment. The lady working the cash/serving is really sweet and pleasant to talk to. They have daily specials and I have personally tried the Wednesday (Chicken Curry) and Friday (Chicken Pulao) specials. I have to say one of the best trini food I have had in a while. Brampton has several options for trini food but this restaurant stands out for it's clean atmosphere, pleasant decor and the value. Pricing is very reasonable and the food is incredible. I have only been here for lunch and show up 45min or so after they have opened up, so the food is ultra fresh and bursting with flavor ( and heat). A must try place for anyone that's looking to try really nice trini food :)"}
{"text":"Only tried the doubles and aloo pie but both were delicious!! Hidden gem indeed :) will be returning very soon  - thank u!!"}
{"text":"I've since seen an article (finally) on the Brampton Guardian, that it was recently closed down due to lack of hygiene and pest control. Also for potential food contamination as it was found to have food not stored properly in freezer/fridges.. someone also commented under the article to say it reopened 4 days later and I pray that's not the case. Makes my skin crawl to think we ate there.. please avoid here until they pick up their act!"}
{"text":"Though I'm always in this plaza to visit Benchmark Sports, I'm never there early enough to try any of the numerous restaurants that operate there. The one time I was at the plaza during regular daytime hours, Lynn's restaurant caught my eye because of their \"Trinidadian Chinese food sold here!\" sign.  Upon entering I was treated to a well lit and clean fast casual restaurant, with a handful of people speaking to a talkative staff member, who I believed to be Lynn. She was very friendly and welcoming with all of her guests and did well in striking up conversations.  My order for the day was bake & saltfish ($7), 2x doubles ($1.60 each), and kurma ($2.75 for a bag).  I was really tempted by the roti & pumpkin, which I had only ever seen on Lynn's menu before, but my craving for bake & saltfish needed satisfaction.  The food came in reasonable time, and I was very satisfied with the doubles - warm and delicious. The bake and saltfish was a treat as well, except I did find it to be a little heavy handed with the salt. Maybe I'll ask for them to add a little less next time. The kurma was a nice snack to munch on the drive home, and before I knew it, I had finished the entire bag!  Overall the food at Lynn's is solid. I'd like to try some of their other meat options next time, and eventually even try their roti & pumpkin. Solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Another lunch option within walking distance of the Rogers Brampton campus is always welcome. Have been here a few times and the cashier is extremely friendly. My favourite is the stew chicken with salad and macaroni pie. My step-grandma used to make the meanest mac pie and Lynn's version reminds me of it. Stew chicken full of flavour and lots of spice ;) Have also had the roti here a few times. The dhal puri and curry chicken are both good. If you don't like spice be sure to mention you don't want any as even mild may be too much for those whole don't eat spice; this is a Caribbean/Trini joint after all ;)"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant several times in the last few weeks.  Favorites so far include lamb curry, dhalpourie, jerk chicken.  All were excellent and tasted like my Guyanese mother-in-law used to make.  Portions are ample and prices are very reasonable.   The owner and staff make you feel like family.  Definitely on my list of regulars for restaurants."}
