{"text":"Have been there twice lately and enjoyed both times.  The live music is great, the bartenders are very friendly and the decor is nice.  Did not try the food, but they had a nice selection of wine and beer."}
{"text":"Our first visit to M's. Lucky to have visited on half price wine bottle night. Had the cheese tray that was excellent. Decided to try the spirit bar with a Manhattan. It was great. Really nice visit with my family."}
{"text":"Lovely new wine+ bar in Cornelius. Just visited for our first time and liked it. Had some wine (although they have beer and spirits too) and tried the shrimp cocktail and bbq pork sliders, both very nice!"}
{"text":"The new place is nice but i missed the wine tasting of the past.  I liked the local entertainment but missed Alain. the new host brought the wrong bottle and were just not as friendly.  I hope they do well as it such a special place. Not sure the pictures go with the wall paper but who am I to judge."}
