{"text":"Its actually 0 stars because we didn't eat anything!  Two weeks ago - Table for 2 and we we seated fairly fast given there was a large crowd waiting.  Ordered calamari to start, panzo and pizza.  Waited 30 mins no calamari.  The waitress comes over and says she forgot to put in our order, places an ice cold loaf of bread on our table and apologizes.  Ok, fine, mistakes happen.  One would think having forgot our order that we would be priority for getting food.  Nope not the case.  Witnessed 2 plates of calamari come out and go to other tables.  By then it was 1 hour after being seated.  Even the table next to us felt bad for our wait.   So we decided to forget the whole meal and as we were walking out the owner/manager is apologizing left and right and says he'll email me something so we can give it another try..... never received anything."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. We ordered an Alfredo and a gnocchi with meat sauce.   The gnocchi was excellent but the Alfredo was bland.  This place I think will be great in another year or two while they get their legs under them."}
{"text":"I was planning on heading home to eat the steak sporpresa sandwich but couldn't make it out of the parking lot.  The smell was just too tempting.  Reparked my car, opened up the box and there it was, waiting for me.   First impression, looked and smelled very good.   Took first bite and couldn't find any meat. Took a couple of more bites, and still no meat.  Finally hit the meat, onions and mushroom after several bits into the foccaccia.    The foccaccia bread was fresh but in my opinion, a bit too big for the portion of meat they put in.  It was also a bit too soggy.  I guess it was from the onions, mushroom and sauce.   If you like the traditional steak sandwich you may not like this style.  Not that it was bad but i like a little crunch to my sandwich.   Price was $11.25 (tax in).    Will i come back... yes.  Please keep in mind,  rating was based on just one sandwich.  Place looked very nice and staff was friendly.  Need to go back and try their pizza."}
{"text":"This place used to be good when we started going here 3 years ago, and we've been going regularly since.  I don't know if ownership changed but we've been noticing a slow decline in quality and taste over the past year.  The last time I was there with the family, which was early October/16, the calamari felt like I was chewing on rubber tires and tasted awful.  Lasagna was cold in the middle and not fresh tasting.  Even the once delicious hot peppers in oil don't taste like what they used to.  We've given this place many chances since we've noticed the negative change but sadly, this will be the last time we'll go there."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't look big from the outside, so I was surprised to see how big and spacious it is when I walked in. They have two entrances for dine-in and take-out (of course, we didn't pay attention and walked straight through the take-out door). The restaurant was bustling for dinner, but luckily, we were seated right away.   The menu is pretty big, with a decent selection of appetizers, salads, pasta, pizza/panzerotti and sandwiches, so it was quite hard to decide on what to eat! We ended up ordering:  - Calamari Fritti: The pieces were huge! So much substance in every bite. Each piece was evenly coated and very crispy. Comes with two dipping sauces (marinara and something mayo-based)  - Pasta Alla Vodka: When they say a hint of vodka, they really mean it. This pasta dish was super creamy, but so loaded with cheese flavour there was no vodka flavour at all.  - Boscaiola Panzerotti: Beware - this is huge! The crust was thin with some crunch, and the filling was piping hot. This comes with marinara dipping sauce on the side.   While the pasta dish was disappointing, the other two items we ordered were delicious. Portions for everything were very generous.   This is a casual and family-friendly restaurant, but if you're coming as a large group during peak dinner hour, you'll probably have to wait for awhile. The servers were attentive and friendly, and our overall dining experience was fairly positive."}
{"text":"Great place for some hot and fresh Italian style pizza! Quick service with friendly staff really make this place a great quick-bite style restaurant. Only tip is to call early for dinner/lunch take-outs because this place gets pretty packed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and since i work nearby, my coworkers and I always frequent this place on lunch time. Since I always come here on weekdays, I am used to ordering at the cashier  and then after ordering, usually pick a table to sit on. Last weekend, I did the usual way of ordering and I was not aware that they actually have full service on weekends where you wait for someone to direct you to your table and order from there. So I told the cashier I wanted to actually dine in and she agreed. In all fairness to the cashier she was new and she was nice enough that she quickly told the kitchen to change it. So we waited to be seated, however no one from the dining area entertained us. The dining area was not full since this was a sunday afternoon at around 4pm. The cashier tried to talk to the server since she noticed we were waiting and proceeded to give us a table. Then one of the servers (the only blonde girl that day) proceeded to lecture us about their weekend rules in a very condescending tone, and that she is allowing us to sit this time as an exception. I don't mind servers correcting me but as they say it is not what you say but its how you say it. She was obviously mad that we took one of her tables. Maybe because she won't get a tip (though i always add a %age tip after I pay at the cashier since I know they clean up for me after) or maybe prices are different on the full service menu? But she could have refused to sit me and it would have been fine if they/she say it nicely. I did not hear the conversation between her and the cashier but surely was the cashier that was serving us. Felt bad for her/the cashier and I even offered that she can just pack our food but she insisted it was ok. This is the only reason why i gave this restaurant a 2 star because of her. But for sure they lost a loyal customer because of  one proud server who can't be bothered to be nice."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Had the margarita pizza (however you spell it) and arugula salad.  The pizza was very tasty.  Thin and crispy and the right touch of burnt.  Inside the pizza was gooey and good.  The arugula salad was a good size.  Could have used more pears and cheese.  Lots of arugula!!! Next time in Canada, I might have to revisit."}
{"text":"Have been to Nonna's multiple times however this time it was just a horrible experience. Went in, the place was empty which shouldn't affect the service. We were told to pick up the take out menu from the counter and sit wherever we would like. A bit weird considering everything we do come here, we are given actual menus rather than take out ones. We waited almost 25 minutes for the server to take our order, she did not acknowledge us at all and was no where to be found. Incredibly disappointed and won't be going here any time again."}
{"text":"What a gem! I dined here yesterday and had the delicious stone-oven prosciutto pizza with arugula and parmesan shreds. I wish I had a photo but my phone died! Trust me, it's amazing. You can even ask for the hot pepper oil to drab on top if you like it a little spicy.   You order at the front, and they'll deliver to your table. You can also take out if you prefer. Frank was so friendly and welcoming. Went through the specials and recommended things to us. He was very attentive and wanted to get to know us. Andre, behind the kitchen, was also very sweet.   Just such genuine people with absolutely delicious, authentic Italian food that reminds me of my own Nonna's (Grandmother's) cooking.   Go try it!"}
{"text":"First time eating there, small place, no-nonsense but pretty full so make reservations. Pizza was delicious, pasta dishes were regular sized, nothing fancy but good. I do agree with other patrons that the crust is quite dry, I didn't eat it, but overall it's thin crust, just enough ingredients on top, not a fancy place but good everyday food."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout the following dishes  Pepperoni Pizza: Pepperoni wasn't very tasty, but I thought the crust, sauce, cheese were all good.  Slightly burnt edges, but ok for this style of pizze Penne Alfredo with Chicken: very good, perfectly al dente noodles, the alfredo sauce was tasty, and the more than enough chicken so almost every bite had some Breaded Veal sandwhich: not the ideal takout food as by the time we go home all the sauce was soaked into the bun, but this was pretty good, veal was on the thin side, but still tasty.  Service was great at the takeout counter  Overall would go again, hopefully sit in next time,"}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome, but last time I ordered two pizzas from here they were not... good."}
{"text":"i found brown hair in the food. waitress did not even apologized, she even accused me of putting my own BLONDE hair in the food for free food. I hope this place shuts down"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Pizza is wood oven and delicious. Not really a restaurant although you can eat there don't expect much."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon/evening and they were busy with some birthday parties.  We were a party of 3, and so they had us wait for a table.  There were at least 4 open tables for two, so I'm not quite sure why they didn't just put two of those together.  We waited for around 15 minutes for another table to clear out before we could get seated.  When we finally were seated, we had to keep calling over someone for assistance.  We received hot water, instead of cold water and had to ask for ice to cool it down to actually drink.  After our food arrived, no one stopped to ask us at all, how it was or if we could get anything else.  The food was quite delicious and the portions are HUGE, so we had a lot of leftovers.  The service was really disappointing, and if it weren't for the good food, I wouldn't have given this 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here with my hubby after hearing some pretty good comments about the restaurant, so I was naturally excited to try out a local Italian place.  The ambiance was nice, staff were friendly but it took longer than expected to get a glass of water. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan not in a sandwich, while my hubby ordered a calzone with an arugula salad to share. First, my Eggplant Parmesan arrived at our table in a bun, plus it was absent of sauce or mozzarella. I sent it back hoping to receive my proper order, but then received a plate of eggplant with minimal sauce on top. Maybe it's me, but Eggplant Parmesan means, sauce and cheese. Our server advised that he'd bring over some cheese (unacceptable) so I politely asked that he have it baked so the cheese melted.  I have to say that the Eggplant Parmesan was terrible. It tasted like old oil and was a far cry from what we all know as \"nonna's cooking\". My hubby enjoyed the calzone and the salad was decent.  I'll give this place one more chance before calling it quits on Nonna!"}
{"text":"I came here after hearing so much hype about this restaurant. I ordered a panzo and i was surprised by how big it was. For a decent price, you get a large portion. I didnt like the taste at all though. It was very bland and boring.. Tasted like store bought sauce and the cheese was thick and tasteless. The service was also very bad, the servers seemed unhappy to be there and rushed to get orders in. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Food is okay - it's the staff that creative a very intense dinner environment.  The staff doesn't really want to do business or something. It's a Saturday night at 9:30 and a couple of customers are walking in. I thought it was a good thing that it was so busy even though it's passed dinner time. As another customer came in the waitress says loudly \" you gotta be fucking shitting me.. just stop\" I'm not sure that's appropriate for the customers to all hear that. All the waiters and waitresses were hovering over my half finished meal itching to clear it off the table. I understand everyone wants to get off work and go home, but this restaurant industry doesn't really work like that. The store owner should have some quality control on staff.  I definitely had a high strung sit down meal tonight which is unfortunate as this joint is a nice go to place."}
{"text":"At our office we have something called \"The Panzo Challenge\", which requires the participant to finish their Nonna's Oven panzerotto in one sitting. Many have tried, some have failed. Who can blame them? it's essentially a small/medium pizza wrapped in half! And how!  Restaurant size: When Nonna's Oven first opened it was pretty small and was always occupied by Honda employees. They've since expanded their size and offer more tables and seating!  Portion size: The food-to-price ratio is definitely favourable for your buck, and you'll definitely be feeling full for many hours, if not the rest of the day.   Service: The ordering line usually extends to the entrance at around lunch time, so there is a bit of a wait to get your order in. A server will bring your plate and cutlery to you, so you just have to wait a little while longer. It will be worth it though."}
{"text":"Great pizza...It's hard to find non-franchise pizza in Richmond hill, but this is by far one of the best pizza I've had in the area. The pizza dough is made in house and is incredibly tasty. They recently expanded their dining area and even included desserts!  The Genovese pizza (pizza with Pesto sauce) is the best - I've tried all their pizzas...every single one of them."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our experience at Nonnas Oven. Food was fresh and tasty, and very reasonably priced.  A bit of confusion when waiting for a table as some people went in the takeout entrance and expected to be seated while quite a few groups were waiting in the proper area. Didn't try to call ahead for a reservation but not sure if they are taken... Two large groups took up most of the tables so we had a 30 no in wait. Overall pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"ok, despite the 2 stars, i would go back and give it another shot. i had the lasagna, which is a \"special\" (only available on wknds) and i was super disappointed. it was mushy, i could hardly taste/detect any cheese...3 of us (group of 6) ordered it and none of us liked it. the good thing was, we shared a pizza as an appetizer and it was delicious. most tables seemed to be ordering pizza, so i'd go back and have that. the calamari looked good too... i'm willing to give it another try. just avoid the lasagna"}
{"text":"Outstanding service here. I walked in by myself and got a veal parm sandwich with cheese. The girl who greeted me was above and beyond and the food was delicious as well. Large portions and fairly priced. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place since its close by where I live and is better than Pizza Pizza, but today changed my opinion of this place (November 22, 2015).   Here is my story of my experience today:   We order the usual, calamari and pizza (Hawaiian Inferno).  Since neither me or my partner eat spicy we always switch out the hot peppers with mushrooms, standard right?     So today we do the same, the waitress repeats \"Okay, no hot peppers\".  When it came, it was loaded with hot peppers but we didn't want to hassle them so we kindly let the waitress know.  She seems new as we never seen her before.  Instead of apologizing she gave us excuse how we asked to switch out hot peppers to banana peppers.  Anyways we just decided to move on and pick out the hot peppers ourselves.   We eat, get the bill and we noticed 2 things. 1 it says Swap out hot peppers $0.00, second was additional topping charge $1.00.  We ask waitress again, why are we getting charged, she says well you switch hot peppers, and then mumbled something like, peppers must be switched with peppers.  Made no sense, and again, no apology nor accepting her own mistake.  The last 10 times we swapped hot peppers for mushrooms, never got charged.   Will we go back to this place?  Not anymore, too many options for this type of quality."}
{"text":"The 1 star goes to our waiter who was very nice and understanding of the idiot they had as hostess(tall male grumpy). So when you drive 1.5 hours on your anniversary to come to a great restaurant, you dont expect to be treated like a PEZZO DI MERDA!!! (Piece of $#*t).    So two of us walk in and wait about 10 min at the front for someone to help us....... No one comes. A second couple walks in, tall grumpy guy rushes over n gives them a table. I was ticked off at this point but said nothing. Another couple walks in...  Same guy looks right over us and asks the other couple if they want a table.  Ok now im fuminggggg!!! I said \"excuse me you saw we were here way before the two couples\" in a grumpy response he says \"YA i know ill get you a table\" the guy literally puts a table in front of the bar so none of the waiters or staff could get through and says your tables ready. Im just so angry at this point. Especially when there was lots of seating.   Our waiter was very very nice he moved us to another table, so at least people could walk through.  Ok so our pizza comes. Looked beautiful. Buttttt our poor waiter tells us \"im so sorry were gonna have to move you to the corner over there, this tables taken\". At that point we just got our food to go. I have never ever felt so unwelcomed anywhere in my life. As a cook, chef and foodie, i frequent mannny restaurants per week. Hands down the worst experience ive ever had. We try to support local, but how can you when there so aweful!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Italian food joint. I had the margarita pizza which was thin crusted and delicious, but was missing the basil which I thought would've made it even better. My wife had spaghetti and meatballs. The only reason I took off a star is because the first time they prepared the pasta, the meatballs were frozen cold in the center, but after we sent it back and they prepared it again, it was very good. The pasta sauce in particular was the star."}
{"text":"My go to spot for delicious and fresh pizza in the oakville/Burloak area. This Italian restaurant features the best comfort dishes and I always get the fresh oven baked pizza.  Clean and modern decor with excellent service and the price is decent.  We enjoyed the Hawaiian and the Calabrese pizzas."}
{"text":"Overall a great family restaurant with superb prices and portions. The portions for sandwiches are gigantic, and all for a affordable price. Service was good, but it's very busy and even when there's tables available, they may tell you to wait which is kinda strange.   I would have given this restaurant 4 stars but they lost one because of their RICE BALL. DO NOT ORDER THE RICE BALL!!! it is very bad but that may just be my opinion."}
{"text":"Must Try: Homemade Rice Balls, Nonna's Meatballs, Prosciuttina Pizza, Meat Lovers Pizza or Panzerotti  Rating: (8/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    Great little (and busy) restaurant located in the north side of the GTA. The food felt very homemade (as per the name implies), with the pizza being the stand out star. The rice balls and meatballs were amazing as well, both in quality and value; some places charge too much for meatballs.   We went around peak hours, so the wait was a bit long, but not unbearable. There is a nice waiting area for customers.   Note that sometimes they are closed on odd days, so it's best to call ahead to make sure they're open lest you be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Fast, friendly, and delicious.  Was there with a group of runners the night before running at 30km race, all of us had pasta, all left with happy bellies.  Even got some free samples of pizza and now desperately want to go back for more!  Sadly we're from Ottawa and only in town once a year for the race, so Nonna please let us know if you ever bring your pasta goodness out East!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want quick, good quality Italian food, I have never ordered something I didn't like it is all very good. Staff is also very nice!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pasta with arrabiata and a pizza. We were placed right next to the door which would open on a freezing cold freeze and not being moved despite asking.  When the arrabiata came it had meat on it which was not marked properly on the menu. When I told the staff, they were unfriendly and did not care. They refused to replace it despite my repeated patronage and severe allergy to  meat. I had to share the pizza my friend ordered.   I was overall not impressed with the service at all. With so many choices for good pizza in York region and maple, I would recommend Abruzio or another place."}
{"text":"Home made taste with fantastic service and friendly hostess. The rice balls: arinchini? ??? Are amazing!  Been here twice and will come back."}
{"text":"We had such high hopes for this place. We started off with calamari and a salad - both were delicious and we couldn't wait to try our pastas!  In a word, the pastas were disgusting. It tasted like someone had dumped a fist-full of salt into the tomato sauce. I don't know if they had mistaken salt for sugar, but each bite was just salt, salt, salt. You couldn't taste the tangy or sweetness of the tomatoes. Nor could you taste any other ingredient because of all the sodium. The meatballs came out lukewarm so we sent it back for them to be reheated. They came out hot the second time. Unfortunately, the texture and taste was just not to our liking. It seems like the meat was over-ground and had too much flour as a binder.   It is really unfortunate because all the reviews sang the praises of their pastas. I'm not really sure if the sauce is always that salty or if it was the chef's error. In any case, we had a really disappointing visit and would NOT recommend the pastas here."}
{"text":"Carry out and Dine in options are always good quality and delicious! Timely service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We came by for lunch on a weekday and ordered the Frittura Mista (medley of fresh calamari, cuttlefish, shrimp, scallops, and white fish deep fried until tender and crisp served with marinara $17) and the Novello Pizza (traditional pizza topped with grilled chicken breast, sundried tomato, roasted peppers and goat cheese $17). They were both very delicious and would definitely recommend ordering the frittura mista because it gives you a variety of fresh season food to try out.  The service here was definitely lacking though. I swear the staff here hates their job. The gentleman at the front took a telephone order right after punching ours in then threw the cordless phone behind him once he took the order down. We asked for water twice and it wasn't until we were half done our meal that we finally got our water. The waiter did feel bad though.  Overall, great food but lacking the service. I would strongly advise against coming in during their busy times because seating is limited and service would plummet even further."}
{"text":"Great tasting pasta and pizza! Had linguini with meatballs and Deluxe Pizza. The meatballs were very soft and the sauce had good flavour. The pizza was a little soggy. We actually ordered it as a panzerotti, but the waitress messed up our order... I was mildly disappointed but didn't want to waste the pizza that they already made, so we didn't send it back. I still want to try their panzerotti though... so I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love Nonna's Oven! It was my first time having Arancini Balls and they did not disappoint (only wish I had eaten it for my meal because it was HUGE) their pizza's are also great, and I love that they have a takeout section in the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"This is the kind of Italian food I've been looking for.  None of that pretentious, two-bite portion stuff; you will never leave this place hungry or unsatisfied.  My family tried this place recently after a night out and it's definitely going to be a go-to for us now.  First: the space.  It's nothing fancy, but it's welcoming and smells delicious the moment you walk in.  This is a place where you can feel comfortable hanging out with your family and going casual.  However, I'd consider taking advantage of their take-out options.  It's probably a smart plan since you'll be ready to face-plant on the closest couch the moment you're done eating.  I really appreciated the semi-open kitchen as well.  It had a real authentic feel being able to see them making the wood oven pizzas and panzerottis right there.  The food: unbelievable.  My family and I tried pretty much everything and shared.  Their panzarottis are wonderful, and most importantly, HUGE.  Seriously, split one with another person or don't expect to finish it.  Their pizza is also excellent, with a great crust and no skimping on the toppings (I only eat pizza for the cheese, ok?).  The salads were very fresh and tasty too.  Without a doubt it was the pasta that blew me away the most.  I tried the alfredo and penne all vodka sauces (you can choose any pasta you like).  My favourite was the vodka sauce - I'll even admit it: I ordered a second portion of that one even though I was full (did I mention that the portions are HUGE?).  The best part about this place though has to be the owner.  He was so warm and friendly, and it made you actually feel like you were walking into an Italian family's home kitchen.  He was especially great with my young nephews and getting them talking rather than keeping their eyes on Candy Crush.  If you're looking for a stuff-your-face, completely-satisfied, casual kind of dining experience: you NEED TO GO HERE."}
{"text":"Whoa. Talk about a sleeper. I sauntered into Nonna's at the behest of not one but two different friends when they learned where I would yesterday evening. I checked the reviews and the pictures and they all seemed to rage about this little place nestled in a tiny plaza on the south side of Elgin Mills Rd in Richmond Hill.  The inside appears to be two former unit's that have merged into one, with the walk-in side being just that, catering towards take-out/away options and quick sit-downs, and the far side being more for larger groups or those looking for a more traditional dining experience. Both equally rustic Italian in design.   I didn't have much time so I reviewed the specials and asked for recommendations from my server and then went totally in the other direction from her delicious suggestions, and ordered a hearty helping of spaghetti and meatballs. I asked how big their balls were, and the server burst out laughing and told me they were pretty big... I played along and told her the bigger the better - I'm pretty sure we're besties now. #bondingOverBallsintheBurbs  I was concerned initially that the order took awhile to come out but when it arrived my concerns immediately evaporated - in the molten steam pouring off the dish. Holy Meatballs! This was the hottest, freshest, and best-cooked dish of spaghetti and meatballs I've ever encountered. The noodles perfectly al dente (just a hair firmer than soft so that the noodles don't get mushy), the sauce a perfectly balanced marinara that was not overly sweet  or overly acidic, and finally da balls, we're a perfect balance as well between egg, breadcrumb and noticeably two kinds of meat used to make the flavours pop (two kinds of meat, sometimes three, is how real Italians do it).  And the best thing of all was the price. $16 for all that food -which rendered me almost in a pasta coma. I was more than happy to pay it, heck I'd pay for it twice!  Eatcrest Out (Thanks Nonna - Ti Amo)"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time and very pleased with our meal. Fast friendly service, fresh ingredients and delicious thin crust. We ordered a couple of meat lovers pizzas but will try other combinations in the future. Definitely will try dining in as well - the menu looks inviting ."}
{"text":"Been patronizing this place since the day they opened.  They were much more friendly and humble and the prices were decent with the food ample and delicious.  Have gone back numerous times over the next few years have noticed their prices climbing higher and higher but still went back because their food was still good.  But did notice with the price hike their portions got smaller and the meats/rapini getting more sparse.  Finally today I got the pasta of the day which was penne Alfredo with mushroom and chicken.  It came to over $16 with taxes.  Took it home and found literally crumbs of chicken inside.  Called the restaurant spoke with a woman who identified herself as the floor manager and basically told me that's how it's suppose to be.  I'm sorry But I just paid take out pasta of the day paying over $16 bucks for penne with sauce and mushrooms that woulld've costed them about 2 bucks to make???? They used to have big pieces of chicken in their pasta for about 13 bucks with tax and now this?????   And it's take out!!!!! And that was their special of the day!!!! Well it's obvious that all they care about now is the almighty dollar and lost their care and pride in serving good food and pleasing their customers.  What a shame ...really thought they wouldn't fall into that trap.  Well good luck to them..keep up with and they will surely lose more of their regular customers than just me. THIS PLACE IS A TOTAL RIP OFF NOW AND COULDNT CARE LESS THAT YOU ARE A REGULAR CUSTOMER....SHAME ON YOU NONNAS OVEN"}
{"text":"The wait of this place can go upwards of 1 hour during dinner time but we luckily got one of the last tables as we came earlier around 630 pm for dinner. There's a home-y feel to the restaurant environment. This place is kinda hidden in the quiet plaza so it's hard to notice otherwise.  We ordered the lasagna and the meat lover's pizza to share and the food came relatively fast. However, the food wasn't as hot as I wanted it to be, we may have gotten unlucky and had one of the last pieces of the batch of lasagna. As we were eating, we saw other tables get their food and it looked pipping hot.   Overall, the portions and sizes are relatively good. If I were to compare this to Levetto, I think Levetto would still be my go to."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! The food was okay. Nothing stood out. We had calamari to start...some pieces were tough. Then we had pasta in vodka rose sauce plus the carbonara. We also had pizza with lots of meat and the Firenze with potatoes. The thing with pizza with potatoes, the potatoes really need to be precooked because they end up half cooked and still with the rae texture and taste. Not sure if i would drive all the way again from Maple since Marcellos is just nearby."}
{"text":"This place rocks. The food is Il Fornello quality at half the price. It's not stuffy, great walk-in service (order at the counter) and the food is on your table in 5 minutes. Wonderful for kids! This kind of place is a rare gem - high quality food, super fast and kid accessible. Love it. You can tell that ownership knows their food!"}
{"text":"I ordered a few things from their catering menu for a bday party this weekend. I have never been here to eat before but decided to give them a try based on some of the Yelp reviews. What I ordered:  Meat lovers  and vegetarian party pizza - both were very good. They didn't skimp on the toppings which I liked. I would have preferred if they made their crust a little thinner but overall it was pretty good.  Calamari tray - everyone really raved about this.  The calamari was cooked just right and not too chewy.  The batter wasn't too thick and the two sauces that came with it was delicious.  I would definitely order from them again for my catering needs. They are a little on the pricey side but you do get good quality Italian fare."}
{"text":"my go to italian restaurant. i have not found anything as authentic as this. food is great and staff is friendly. do expect line ups on fridays and saturdays as they serve amazing sauce dripping homemade lasagna in those 2 days only."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the pizza, thin crust with a good amount of prosciutto, arugula and Parmesan cheese.   Definitely would come back for more pizza.   We also ordered the veal sandwich, which was mediocre.  Don't think I would reorder.   Overall, really good atmosphere, pizza was delicious and plentiful portion sizes.   I'd come back to try another pizza and calamari."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. Everything I ordered was fresh and very good. Pasta, sandwiches and rapini."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Italian sit-down restaurants in york region. The pastas are always delicious, their spaghetti  carbonara is heavenly. My sister raves about the rice balls though I can't relate bc I'm not a huge fan of rice balls in general. The calzones are gargantuan in size. I ordered the pizza twice and was disappointed both times (it is actually decent to good pizza but not as yummy as I expected it to be) so I will tend to stick to the pasta entrées and veal sandwiches when I go there."}
{"text":"Pizza was very dry. Pasta was great. Lasagna was horrible. I've tasted better from a frozen one. Calamari was nothing special, very big pieces but no taste. Sauce that came with it was mediocre."}
{"text":"This was stop number 5(?) for the Perfect Pizza Quest UYE this time organized by Allison Y.    The time was set for 7pm on a Friday and Nonna's closes at 10pm.  On Fridays and Saturdays we were told that the restaurant does not take reservations so basically it was a first come first serve scenario.    I arrived with my wife at around 6:45 or so and stood in the small standing/waiting area at the dine in entrance (there's 2 entrances, dine in and take out) and the area was quite packed.  Somebody came along eventually and had asked if we had our names down or if anybody had spoken to us yet and I had said no.  I believed we had about 10 or so coming so I put in our names for 10.  The server said that they may have an issue getting us seated all together because it was really busy that evening but we had hoped whatever they could do for us considering it was a busy evening and the place was at capacity with parties ahead of us in the queue even.  We were told it would be perhaps a 50 minute wait and since many were coming from all over I had told the server that it was fine.  Not until just after 7pm did more people came but the tables weren't ready till around 730 or so.  We had to be seated apart with a table of 6 and another of 4.  There wasn't much we could do as the place was at capacity but we took it.    The menu had a lot to choose from and the choices were pretty good from a healthy choice of starters and apps to pasta to pizza to other mains we had a choice but for the most part everybody ordered pizza except for Wayne who went with 2 meatballs and 2 arancini.  Our table split the antipasto plate which had a mix of cold cuts, cheese, zucchini, eggplant, olives and other cured meat.    The pizzas ranged from about 11 to 15 dollars and the single serving pizzas were of a good size.  My wife had ordered the Firenze which is listed as follows:  \"Foccaccia pizza, mozzarella, sliced potato, caramelized onion, goat cheese, whole black olives and seasoned with oregano, olive oil and fresh rosemary. *available only as a pizza.\"  I had the deluxe \"Basic, ham, pepperoni, sliced black olives, fresh mushrooms,and green peppers.\"  I have to say that I enjoyed this pizza.  The crust was good and it wasn't soggy.  I'm not sure exactly how it was cooked (on what surface, pan etc) but it was good and it was more of an authentic Italian type pizza versus the closer to Canadian chain type pizza.    The service was attentive and friendly.  It is easy to see why this place is very busy.  They serve good food at reasonable prices and have a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great staff! From great salads , great pizza, fried calamari to their signature rice balls, all is truly good.great family restaurant to a casual night out, can be very busy! We are moving back to the city but we know we will be back as often as we have been! We love it there!"}
{"text":"Walked in and wasnt greeted - not very pleased in the beginning. When they realized I was there (how could you not? I'm a pretty big guy), they were very polite. I guess they thought I was doing take out because I entered through the take out side. There were no signs showing it was take out side/dine in.   Ordered the Americana pizza and spicy tomato sauce spaghetti with Italian sausage. The pasta was fantastic, but pizza wasn't what I expected. The pizza was $12, which isn't too expensive. But for the size, I wouldn't go back for the pizza. I could easily make that myself or go to pizza pizza if I wanted a pizza fix. While I was eating, the server kept coming over to ask how I was doing.  3 stars for food + 1 star for very polite service, after the initial wait in the beginning."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food wasn't great. Eastside Mario's or olive garden does better Italian food. Only the pizza is worth going back for."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and was impressed with the food portion, taste, service and speed. Little disappointed to be sitting near the door as it was cold."}
{"text":"A quiet Wednesday night visit, with only a few tables in the restaurant being served. I like to think it's the location that doesn't help.   Service was good, clean environment and food came quickly.  We ordered the meat calzone and meatball spaghetti. The calzone was HUGE, to the point it could be on an episode of Man VS Food. It tasted pretty good with the housemade sauce on the side for dipping. The value is good for about $15 and you'll have leftovers. The meatball spaghetti was very good, the meatballs are also HUGE and it just reminded me of a classic spaghetti dish.  TL/DR: More of a 3.5 star review, value is decent and taste is good."}
{"text":"Where have I been the last 3 and half years?  My kid and I just devoured a standard Margarita and a fried calamari and both were perfect. Best calamari in the area. Nice, thick, tender and crunchy with marinara and spicy mayo (not spicy at all though)- really good.  The pizza- perfect crust, nice and thin, crispy and chewy. Sauce really tasty. Clearly I need to start coming back regularly."}
{"text":"In my opinion, skip the pasta and just order pizzas.   Loved the Firenze pizza. Chewy and thin dough and excellent combo of toppings. Black olives were flavourful - no canned olives here - thin potato slices, sweet carmelized onions and salty goat cheese. Would definitely come back to try another pizza.   Lasagna ($12) was completely forgettable and sauce wasn't any better than standard passata. Will skip next time. Arancini was a little soggy inside and the same forgettable tomato sauce was used. Calamari was large (forgot to add a photo) and used a full squid (could see the various parts) as opposed to just frozen rings.   Draft Birra Dolomiti was refreshing ($10 a pop).   Gets very busy on Friday nights - expect a wait or arrive before 6:30pm. At least the host was honest and realistic about the wait time. Overall service was quick.   Only qualm is your clothes have that \"deep fried\" smell afterward due to the semi open kitchen -- or maybe it was because we were seated next to the pizza station."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and were not disappointed!  Hubby and I got two pizzas and salad.  Half way through we both said we could have ordered one pizza and shared.  Portions are large.  People around us were getting calzones and pasta... And everything looked awesome.  Decor needed some work but they DID just open....really like this place and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Firenze Pizza, calamari and the arugula salad with pear, and a glass of wine... best combo for a date."}
{"text":"I'd say the this is the best Italian restaurant in Richmond Hill. This is an extremely family friendly place, which me and my family regularly eat at."}
{"text":"Honestly Nonnas oven has the most underrated pizza. Amazing food, just wish it wasn't always so packed"}
{"text":"This is our local brick oven cooked thin crusted pizza. We love ordering the hawaiin inferno due to the slight bit of spicy /chilli kick (a twist to your regular hawaiin/ham/pineapple pizza).   This place is always busy. We usually just order take out and whenever I arrive, it's always full of customers.  This is a restaurant with enough seating for a small party but if you want to come here with big group, they can accommodate it as well.   Since we live so close, as mentioned above, we often just call ahead and order our beloved pizza. I think they skimp out on the toppings and I wouldn't mind more pieces of meat and pepper but I still enjoy feasting on it!  They have a specific take out /pick up section and then there's another dining area in another room (looks parted that way) for just in-house dining."}
{"text":"got the panzerotti and the lasagna lasagna is a 4/5  good size and very tasty. lots of tomato sauce and cheese love it panzerotti 3/5 it was fun to hold but also it was heavy . we got the Canadian one however inside the panzo it wasn't that packed with sauce and cheese compared to places like pizza pizza where it oozes out like a waterfall. still good but wouldn't get it again because was a little dry but included salsa  overall portions were big and we had to take some home also the waiters are friendly !!"}
{"text":"Wow this place hits the spot  Have been there several times  I have had AND FINISHED the panzos The Americana is my fav but the meat lovers on is good as well  Have had the steak soppressata sandwich  Definitely on point.....  What really was super delish was the Fantasia pizza Arugula with proscuitto on top Just like my father-in-law makes it at home Super awesome  Will keep coming back to this place for my lunchtime Italian fix"}
{"text":"First time here to this neighbourhood Italian restaurant and very pleasantly surprised.  The food is excellent and very authentic.  The cheese tortolini tastes exactly like the ones I had a few months ago in Italy!!  The stone oven cooked pizza was very good and came to us quick quickly which was great since I was quite hungry.  We also had the traditional rice balls and the crepe dessert....And given we had two people , we ordered way too much.  We were kind of like kids in a candy store.    Very friendly, attentive service and good food!    What else can I say except I will be back!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I was with two wonderful colleagues. The inside is so bright and spacious and I love that because I like seeing what I'm eating (no offense to Noir because that place is awesome too). The tone of the restaurant is cozy and classy, both elements well balanced. It's a great place for a date or a get together. Pretty much any social situation for small groups or less.   I ordered the boscaiola pizza: traditional pizza topped with mushrooms, Italian sausage, and roasted sweet red peppers for $15. What a deal! My colleagues got a veal sandwich and a Firenze pizza (focaccia pizza with potato, onions, goat cheese, and whole black olives seasoned with oregano, olive oil, and rosemary).  Boscaiola was 5/5. I got it because it sounded heavy, which is my fav type of pizza. The ground pepper I got complimented the Italian sausage for well. The mushrooms were really fresh and made the whole pizza juicy but didn't make the pizza soggy.   The Firenze pizza had a light taste and was relatively dry until you sink your teeth into that cheese. The olives complicate the taste and make the potato slices have an interesting flavour.  The calamari fritti my colleague treated us was divine. Juicy, and they come with two sauces. Marinara and... Some non spicy mayo based pink sauce. I only had the calamari with the pink sauce and it was so good. The batter is seasoned too, and it wasn't oily at all even after it's been sitting on the table for a good hour as we devoured our entrées first.   Def recommend. It's lovely to see a non franchise pizza joint that's classy and cozy. You know an Italian place is good when you see a lot of Italians come in here!  See, mom, having pizza for dinner can be classy too!"}
{"text":"Delicious and very filling pasta. Dishes were decently priced. Staff were really friendly. If you're really hungry and craving Italian, I recommend stopping by Nonna's Oven."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice so far. And, both times, the food was excellent. The best is their Panzerottis. I think, they are one of the best I have had.  September 2016: We pretty much come here frequently, for the Pizza, the Panzerottis and my new favourite, the Lasagna. Lasagna is server on Fridays and on the weekends. The Arugula salad is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Tried this place for an office potluck. Everyone loved the mozzarella balls and the veggie pizza. Pricing could have been a little better. However the food was at its Italian best."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise.   There was nothing inventive here, just simple Italian done right. Virtually everything was homemade. We had the antipasto, calamari and riceball to start and then shared a pizza and ravioli + rose sauce.The portions were welcoming, heaving on the plate. I draw special attention to the starters. The calamari was thick-cut in-house, beautifully battered and fried. The antipasto was a mountain of enticing variety - everything from house made focaccia, to caprese salad, to roast veggies along with the traditional olives, cheese and charcuterie. The riceball was a brilliant amalgamation of textures and tastes, and the sauce...my god, the sauce...epic!  My only objections are that the pizza was a touch overdone and that the venue is...meh...although it's not pretentious and it is good for families.  Last but not least, I think I met the hardest-working waiter in the world. The man was knowledgeable, engaging, accommodating and managed to keep the whole restaurant running on his own. Give this man a raise!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"4-4.5 easily.  Amazing food, amazing service.  Family owned place with Nonna cooking in the back...if there is a Nonna i know the food is going to be good.  I have tried their rice ball, sopreza sandwich, and veal sandwich and all were excellent.  Have been back already and will continue to."}
{"text":"Ordered the pasta and was less than par. Just spaghetti and alfredo with no herbs or spices that left the dish flavourless. The portion size was decent but for a high price it is definitely not worth the money.   Overall meal was nothing special and would not return."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the place!! Great Italian food and taste! The pizzas are amongst the best I've had!  If you try to come at lunch... I would suggest to come early!! This place is a hot spot for the lunch time crowd. If you're looking for something to tie you down until dinner... I recommend the meat ball sandwich with cheese, onion and mushrooms... My ultimate favourite... a pepperoni calzone .... so big I doubt you'll finish it all at once!!"}
{"text":"ordered a penne pasta with a spicy vodka sauce for pick up. it was a very generous portion and already to go when i arrived. the pasta was definitely fresh but a bit bland. i will probably come back for pizza, not pasta. it was a bit pricey for pasta but again, the portion was very generous, so i can't complain."}
{"text":"Rice ball was tasty but mushy. Pizza crust was just flat, no taste and not crispy at all, tasted like cardboard and this was when eating in house! Would not go back"}
{"text":"Absolute worst Italian food I've had. Had the spaghetti and meatballs and if you want filler kind of meat and not real ground beef that's what you'll get. For the price of the meal it wasn't worth it at all. I hate seeing this when restaurants start putting meat fillers in their meatballs or more so they look like your getting a really good deal but your not.  My first thought was Lipton side kicks is a lot better than this. My wife had the carbonara and that was blah.  I really wanted to give it a good review but I just couldn't especially for the price. If the price point was somewhat affordable than i wouldnt have complained. But since it was pretty expensive I just found that I'd write a review so others can save themselves of trying the spaghetti and meatballs. We did try the pizza and found that it was just ok I would give the pizza probably 2.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Love it food there!! The Calamari, pizza, and pasta all really amazing.  I have been over 10 or 20 times. This is def my fav Italian go to restaurant. I think this place deserves a 5 star for its food.  The reason I gave this place a 3 star is because I received a bad service there today.  I order Hawaiian pizza and I specifically said \"I want to switch out the hot pepper with mushroom\" because I don't eat spicy. The waitress even repeated \"ok, No hot pepper.\" And then she brought the pizza with banana pepper and mushroom. Situation like this, as customer i have the right to tell her make us a new one, because she took the wrong order and I can't eat spicy! But I don't want to make it such a big deal. so I picked out the pepper and ate the pizza.  When we were paying, she charged extra for the topping. and we told her we never asked for extra topping, it was her took the wrong order. but she just wouldn't recognized her own mistakes, and said the extra charge is because the extra topping. LOL Its not the problem of charing us extra. It was her horrible attitudes. All we wanted was she should recognize her own mistake of taking the wrong order! Someone like her should not be working in the services industry."}
{"text":"Came here with fellow Yelpers on a Friday night. The restaurant was really busy and we had to wait for 30 mins to get seated. They do not take reservations on Friday night.   After we got seated they were very prompt in giving us the menus and getting our drinks. We ordered our food and we surely didn't notice how long it took even though there were 6 of us. We ordered the Antipasto to begin. They had a lot of grilled vegetables in the antipasto. There were tomato slices topped with mozzarella, salami and sliced soppressata. Everything tasted good and the antipasto was big enough to be shared by 4 people.  For the mains I had the fantasia pizza which was made with foccaccia topped with proscuitto crudo in a bed of arugula and parmesan shavings. The pizza was light since all the toppings were very fresh but still flavourful. The spicy oil gave a nice kick to the dish. I also tasted a slice of the firenze pizza which had potato slices, rosemary and black olives. The olives were a bit too salty but otherwise the pizza was delicious.   The service was quite good and they topped up our water quite often. Pizza does make me quite thirsty. Overall I really liked the food, ambience and service and I will likely be back soon to try their huge rice balls."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite! I was impressed with the portion size of the pizzas, they were big enough to share! We also ordered calamari which are nice big pieces served with lemon, marinara, and a side of chipotle type mayo for dipping. Everyone here is friendly and the food was served quite quickly. I will come again!"}
{"text":"My GF and I came here for some Italian food, and we weren't disappointed. We even forgot to take our left-overs, but someone ran it out to us as we were starting the car! Food came fast, tasted Great, and the service was excellent. I'm definitely coming back next week."}
{"text":"Been here twice and overall not bad. They don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday nights so if you don't want to wait I suggest you go there early. My group of 5 arrived around 5:45-6 and didn't have to wait.   It seems this place does takeout, however my group did not have the opportunity to do take out we just ate there.   The service is excellent. They ask if you want water at the beginning and for all you Asians don't worry, they serve hot water if you want.   On Friday nights they have a lasagna special which in my opinion tasted alright. I've had better lasagna, just thought they could've added more meat. On the other hand, the Nonna's meatballs were delicious! They give you two giant ones and they were filling. Calamaris were just good as well.   Time for the main courses. We 'only' had the pizza and panzarotti and those panzarottis were massive!!! I feel like it could take 2-3 people to finish it! It's like two massive sandwiches combine. I feel like if you open the panzarotti it is definitely much bigger than the pizza. Anyways next time I go, I may try the pasta instead. Until next time."}
{"text":"Giving  this 5 starts strictly on the panzerotti. It's huge! Lots of filling and even tastes great the next day when we reheat in the toaster oven."}
{"text":"Had the steak sorpresa with added eggplant and a Coke. The focaccia is thin, almost like a wrap than the thicker bread I'm used to and the mix of small strips of steak, onions, mushrooms, mozzarella and sauce was pretty average. I was hoping it'd be more like steak pizzaiole, but it was nothing like it. Even w/ all those ingredients, the flavor was muted and needed salt and a hit of Parmesan and chili oil. The Coke was refreshing."}
{"text":"Nonna's Oven is a casual Italian joint that serves pizzas, pastas, sandwiches and salad.  It is similar to a mom and pa pizza take out place, but it focuses more on dining in.  We ordered a quattro stagione pizza, a tomato salad and a meatball side order.  This was too much food for 2 people.  The pizza looked pretty.  The dough tasted sweet and the toppings were flavourful and fresh.  Nonna was not stingy on using lots of black olives and artichokes.  The salad seemed homemade with fresh ingredients.  I figured I could make one just like it at home.    The interior decor is clean, basic but pleasant.  The service was polite and quick.  I liked what we ate.  Nonna is quite nice as a simple, inexpensive and quality pizza joint."}
{"text":"$60 for 3 panzzi's!... That's insane. Had two deluxe style and one Hawaiian. There was little to no stuffing inside each, majority was just tick dough. Really disappointing considering how much it cost and how everyone who reviews these days seems to REALLY talk things up.... enough people, let's be honest, get control of your endorphins, don't let public stardom get to you with a review, just tell the truth. Maybe even edit a bs one you've left and after some time has passed, truth will be bitter. Anyways, $60 for a complete waste (tasted odd too, like spoiled veg or something) and not to mention the OBVIOUS attempt at trying to get a tip!.... I can't stand that, want more money, find a better paying job, not the customers fault to pay for a cheap employers ways...."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and got takeout. I ordered a fettuccine alfredo with chicken. This cost me $25 which is quite pricey for pasta, but since it was new I decided to try it. The portion was rather small and the noodles seemed store-bought. The chicken was super tough and bland. The order came with two breadsticks which weren't special at all. Overall, the prices are quite high for the apparent quality--I would rather go to Scaddabush for quality food. Customer service was fine but the food will not have me coming back."}
{"text":"Fantasia Pizza $14.95 - A 14 inch, 6 slice thin crust pizza with an excellent crunch on the crust. Found it to be a very messy pizza to eat since the meat would not come apart when biting into it. The meat was really salty but everything tasted good when it came together.   Calamari fritti $11.95 - when I saw how huge the calamari was I thought it was an old rubbery squid but it was soft and tender and tasted great with the dipping sauce.  Service was fast, friendly and very attentative. I love the look of the place and the decore. I liked how even the two seater tables were very large and had lots of space for the food."}
{"text":"I've never been more disappointed at a restaurant. We travelled 30 min to try this restaurant out and would've honestly been better off eating the spaghetti that is sold in cans at the grocery store. When we entered, 3 employees just stared at us. I asked for a table for 2 and they just stared back until someone walked over to bring us to a table. I asked if we could sit at the booth tables since the restaurant was NOT busy and they said no they save those for larger groups. Mind you the restaurant is half empty (pics attached of two empty booth tables, there were 5 more on the other side that were empty). The food is terrible (we couldn't even finish our pastas...), meatball tastes like bread (wth) and service was meh at its best. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Came in with my gf and we were waiting for more than 30 mins + and I asked the waitress where is our orders are coming. She then realized that she forgot our orders"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for Italian food; their cheese platter starter is absolutely amazing! Their pizzas are equally as delicious, and their service is also really good. During the busy hours - the line goes out the door by 8pm on Fridays and Saturdays, so plan to arrive a little earlier than normal if you don't want to be waiting for 20 minutes.   Pro-tip - they sell their own homemade pasta sauce, and chili sauce/oil! You can pick these up and incorporate into your own home cooking. I believe the sauce they sell is also the same base they use in all their dishes!"}
{"text":"Came with my mom for dinner on a Thursday and it wasn't too busy. We were seated right away and since we already looked at the menu we already knew what we wanted. We got 1 arancini ($4.50), a pasta alla vodka with spaghetti ($12.95) and the meat lovers pizza ($13.95). The arancini was humongous. I knew it was going to be big from the other reviews but it was still a surprise. It was a little thick to swallow but the sauce helped that. I wish there was more of it. I think that's what really filled us up since we could only eat half the pasta and half the pizza after. The pasta has a good flavour with the rose sauce and little pancetta bacon bits in it. I liked the pizza more than the pasta. There was a generous amount of meat and I like the thin crust. There was also this chilli oil they gave and I couldn't get enough of it. I put that sh*t on everything. The table next to us got calamari which looked and smelled amazing so I will def come back to try that and the rest of the menu. This is the closest Italian place to us that's actually decent and the portions to the price isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"What can I say.  It's just like Nona used to make.  The service is personal and the food never leaves you hungry.  Try the penne a la vodka.  We've eaten here numerous times, and never chosen a dish we didn't like."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighbourhood early enough to score a table on a Friday night. Got there at 530 and at 545 there were only seats left at the bar!   Delicious home style food, friendly service, very reasonable prices and lots of happy tables.  We had: Lasagna - only available Fridays and Saturdays. No cheese in this meat laden pasta dish. Really good tomato sauce. Made for Garfield. Gnocchi with vodka sauce - I brought half of this very decadent dish home. Excellent homemade gnocchi.  I am sure we will return again with our child. Lots of pizza options that she would enjoy."}
{"text":"Another rare time when the yelp reviews get a place completely wrong, or the locals just don't know any better.   Biggest ripoff I've had in awhile. I ordered the steak & onion sandwich with hot peppers and mozza sandwich had 1 tiny little shaving of beef and sone onion on it, with a tiny little bit of shredded mozza, which cost extra. The roll itself was nice but almost zero filling. 2 meatballs to start and the meatballs themselves were just ok but in the most bland tomato sauce ever. Try adding some garlic and pepper. My friend had the veal sandwich which was equally terrible.  When I approached the waitress to pay I told her about no hot peppers and 1 tiny piece of meat and her response was \"oh\" All for about $34 including tax and extras on the sandwiches. Ripoff."}
{"text":"Nonna' Oven in #richmondhill  Last night we were working on a project and my guys needed to eat something, but good.  Amazing that this strip plaza has a packed little place.  Waited 15 min for a table and boy was it worth it.  We ordered the Calamari and salad to start.  It was fresh and crispy.  Yes, the Calamari and the salad.  Then these gorgeous plates came out with hot and delicious meatballs with a nice home sauce. Nothing was left. They even give you some bread to soak up the extra sauce.   Finally we got the pizza. Nice burnt crispy crust and excellent toppings.  I would have liked a little more meat on my pie but it was very tasty.  It was already half gone before I could even pull out my camera.  To wrap up dinner we had some espressos and cannoli.   What a great meal, what food, great value, nothing fancy a true family Italian Restaurant in Richmond Hill.  I look forward bringing my family back for the panzo and a few pasta dishes I must try.   #foodreviewca #gastropost #richmondhill #torontoeats #markhameats #yelpgta #food #dinner #lunch #yum #foodie #foodblogger #eat #Italian #restaurant #nonnasoven #hot #dineto #family #kidfriendly"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place isn't rated higher! The venue is comfortable with open space and high ceiling. The food is large in portion and tasty. The price is reasonable.   Their veal and chicken sandwich with eggplants is amazing! The pizzas are very good as well. I've tried quite a few things on the menu and so far nothing has disappointed me."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Nonna's Oven after a failed attempt the previous weekend (walked in and was advised an 1.5 hour wait!)..came back on a Friday night and still had to wait approximately half an hour.  While waiting for our table, we silently observed what other people had on their tables... which did not help my hunger. When we finally got seated, we ordered almost one thing from every category.. including the pasta alla vodka, jojo pizza, Americana panzo, calamari, rice ball, meat balls, and a focaccia sandwich.  Pasta alla vodka: This was delicious, flavourful and perfect al dente..probably my favourite dish for the night.  Rice ball: I didn't like this very much, it stuck to my teeth.  Jojo pizza: Delicious, thin and super crispy.  Americana panzo: This was MASSIVE.. but because of the tomato sauce and veggies inside..it became quite soggy... would prefer a pizza instead.  Calamari: Amazing.. the batter was crisp and stuck with the calamari, comes with marinara and a house sauce which was delicious.  Overall, I would recommend coming before or after the peak times...be prepared for long waits during weekend dinner times. The portions are great for sharing are they are huge; service is friendly and seating is comfortable.  FYI: They only take reservations Monday - Thursdays."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and affordable, with the vibe of a casual Italian eatery. There's a take-out counter, but also a dining area for those eating in. I had the spaghetti carbonara, which was nice and well-seasoned, but a bit oiler than expected. I also tried the fried calamari, which was delicious and enough to share between two people (or three, if you're not particularly hungry). The service was welcoming and prompt, and everyone was friendly. I'd love to return for some hearty comfort food again!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome reviews.. and was recommended to me by one of my Italian clients.. too bad it failed to impress me or my guests..  All in all, I would only come back for a pepperoni take-out.. maybe once..  Walked in just before 8pm on a Sunday night.. asked for a table for 3.. told us to wait 10 minutes for a table when they had 5 open tables?!! They finally figured out 10 minutes in that they could put 2 small tables together to seat us.. those tables were vacant beside each other to begin with.. other then this the service was excellent and I tipped them 20%+  I'm not Italian and no expert at Italian food...  so I won't use the proper dish names..  The Deli Platter for 2 was great!! The salami, the cepresse (mozzarella and tomato), grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini, bread sticks were all good. But the SWEET CHERRY PEPPER STUFFED WITH GOAT CHEESE was awesome and probably the highlight of the night.  My guest decided on a prosuito pizza, none of us really enjoyed it.. (pizza dough oven baked with any cheese or sauce.. then some salad and prosuito on top..  we all think a traditional meat or veggie pizza would have done this place justice. As we specifically came here for pizza..  My main course was meat sauce penne.  Only thing good about my pasta was it was cooked al Dante. The house bolognese sauce was flavourless (also mentioned in others comments) and it was runny..so even with the al Dante penne, it didn't really stick because it was so runny..   Had to ask them for Parmesan cheese (probably should have been auto served with my pasta order..) and also had to order olive oil and vinegar to dip our bread sticks, panini, and pizza into.. the starch in this Italian restaurant just wasn't on par to eat it without some sort of additional flavour..  As for my guests' main courses, they had chicken and steak sandwiches respectively. Buddy with the steak said it tasted propane grilled.. he enjoyed the onions and I liked the mushrooms. Buddy with the chicken said his tasted like chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Fried calamari is a big portion but the size of the rings are so large makes it extra chewy and could use more flavour on it. I've had it twice now giving it a second chance. I'm a squid lover but next time I will pass. Tried the tomato salad last time could also use some more seasoning not a very flavourful dressing maybe add some salt and pepper....  Caeser Salad lacks seasoning as well in the dressing. It's ur average caeser dressing, defiantly not enough garlic in the dressing. Taste pretty much just like the mayo( oil and eggs that's usually the base of every ceaser salad..  The pizza though is delicious.. If your looking for that flat crust full of topping pizza go straight to the pizza menu!  It's a cute place where u can watch the chefs make your pizza while you wait a long while for your take out. Wait is quite long make sure you call in your order for pick up.   Service is lacking..considering it's always usually really good... lots of new staff .. updating my review... asked for the wine menu. Server came back didn't ask if we would like any wine just snatched it off the table and never came back. Eventually we got some wine. Never checked on us. After finishing our meal literally 30 seconds later we where just handed the bill on the table not with a thank u. And we had just ordered another glass of wine right before the bill landed on our table, can i take a sip before I'm kicked out? Lol And when we gave our cash we were asked do u want change for this? It's  customary not to ask and just always assume ur guests want change right?"}
{"text":"Really good food, the service was amazing. Staff was ver knowledgeable and helpful. The food was fresh. Huge portions for the amounts of money paid. Lovely small restaurant. Would love to go again."}
{"text":"It's aright not bad. I think it was better when I first came just 10 years ago many. Things were made to perfection. It's still good now! Love the pizza and the pasta !"}
{"text":"I love Nonna's Oven :)  It is definitely one of my favourite go to spots for fast, delicious and authentic Italian food. It is located in a small plaza SW of Leslie/Elgin Mills, in the same plaza as La Rocca Creative Kitchen, Starbucks, and Akimi Japanese Cuisine. The restaurant is very cozy; you will usually see many of families dining together.  The 2 separate entrances often confuse a lot of people. The left door is for take-out, and the right door is for dine-in. (Please read the signs!) They separate the two mainly because of crazy lunch/dinner hours. Wait staff service is available where you can order at your table. During other odd hours, dining in or not, just stick to the left door. You purchase for your meal and beverages at the cashier, grab yourself a seat anywhere, and wait staff will bring the food to you if you are dining in.  One of my all time favourite (customized) item to order is the Gnocchi in Alfredo Pesto Sauce. You need to add $$ for that pasta, and for the sauce upgrade lol. The panzoretti is also a must order; it is impressively large (like the size of a pillow!). I usually enjoy the classic pepperoni and cheese flavour, or create my own Hawaiian styled ^^ The calamari is also one of my favourite appetizers  Nonna's Oven was highly recommended over and over again by my friends before I knew about it. And now I do the same whenever someone needs a recommendation for some Nonna-style Italian food in the area ;)"}
{"text":"Nonna's Oven is a favourite of mine. In a world of Italian restaurants that all too often pretend to be something they're not,  this place holds true to simple, fresh, home style food at a reasonable price. You're not going to come here for a upper-crust dining experience, but the pizza crust is the perfect crispy/chewy balance. The pasta reminds me of home, the calamari is tender and the tomato salad is perfect. Great neighbourhood Italian eatery."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food and very reasonable pricing. The only issue is not enough tables to accommodate the crowd. Get their early if you don't want to wait a while. Food is excellent and they offer take out"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizzas and pasta . We also got calamari. We did a take out and good was ready in less than 10 minutes. Friendly owners. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great option for Italian food in the richmond hill/Markham. Food is yummy and prices are fair. The servers are all very nice and attentive as well. Very family-friendly environment, but be prepared for a bit of a wait on weekends. They don't take reservations during peak hours."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since it opened by my house but didn't realize that I haven't written a review!  Super cool neighborhood Italian place with dine-in and take-out.  Super friendly staff that are nice no matter what the ask (we've been picky a couple of times in terms of requests or seating).  The food is great - pizza from the fire oven, pasta many different ways and nice veal sandwiches!  We visit regularly but do be aware of busy times - they get filled up fast!!"}
{"text":"It is a decent Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood. Indeed, it was quite popular and full house on Wednesday evening.   I passed by this place many time, but I have never tried it. At first I thought it was a small self-serve resto. I was surprised the place was bigger than I thought. It were greeted by friendly servers; the service was kind of prompt and fast.   We ordered -  Arugula Salad - it was OK. I wish it would have more honey and lemon dressing.   Pizzas - Meat Lovers and Novello. Toppings are quite generous. The pizzas were family size. The pizzas were nicely done. They were \"stone oven\" pizza but I couldn't taste the aroma. The thin crust could be more crispy. The knifes they provided cannot cut through the pizzas. :) I like Novello more just because I like meat with veggies.   Pasta Alla Vodka - portion was generous. The rose sauce was flavourful. Penne was made al dente. This was the dish I enjoyed the most.   The server offered us parmesan cheese and hot sauce.  The hot sauce was really spicy and tasted very good! It went well with the Novello pizza."}
{"text":"We were looking at Italian restaurant near Aurora community centre and most of them were closing at 3.00 pm. This one place in Richmond Hill was open from 11:00 to 10:00 pm. Clean ambience and good family crowd... Service was very quick with good vegetarian options. We tried Giardino pizza which was 12 inch and good enough for two. Focaccia Sorpresa was good too but we ended up ordering both the dishes with same toppings. We were served with Chili oil on the side which made the Pizza experience much better.. We had taken our American guests for lunch and everyone liked it.."}
{"text":"I love their rice balls!!    Food is generally good.  Parking is easy."}
{"text":"Great selection of pasta, and they are very tasty! It's a perfect spot for family & takeouts."}
{"text":"Had lunch and dinner her many times and with many different groups. The food is consistently very good overall and the servers are fantastic. Very busy Friday and Saturday nights and may take a while to be seated. I placed a pickup/catering order from Nonna's Oven for a 20 person lunch I had before Christmas and it was a success. We did a variety of pizzas, veal, fried calamari, pastas, rice balls, salads, anti-pasto, potatoes and vegetables. Everyone was happy with all of the items ordered and I would use them again for an event the same size."}
{"text":"Came here recently with some of the Yelp Pizza Quest crew, as this place came recommended...and it was a good choice.  Place was pretty busy on Friday night, but we were still able to get seats fairly quickly. The wait-staff were friendly, helpful, and pretty efficient given how packed the place was.  I had the \"Boscailo,\" which was just one of several options of Nonna's stone-oven pizza's - most of these also come available as a panzerotti. Anyway, the pizza was topped with  fresh mushrooms, Italian sausage, and roasted sweet red peppers, as additions to the \"Basic\" cheese/tomato sauce. Adding a little bit of the provided hot sauce really brought out the flavours of the pie.  This place is a bit out of my way for frequent visits, but if I'm in the area, I'll be back."}
{"text":"It was disgusting how the management and employees treated myself and my family, they didn't even bother to seat us. Maybe we didn't fit in with the \"standard look\" of everyone else who was eating and their typical cliental, but no excuse to not seat us or even bother cleaning a table for us to sit down.   I used to come to this place when they just opened, their attitudes were very different, perhaps, money and success has gone to their head, which is always a recipe for eventual failure in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Nonna's Oven might be one of the better place if you want family style Italian food. The menu specializes in salad, pasta, pizza and sandwich.  There are quite a selection of pizza all made fresh when order and great for sharing.   We came on a Sunday evening and the place was quite busy. We were seated right away without the need to wait for a table.  American Pizza, Tomato Salad and Penne with Arriabiatta were all enjoyable. The Lava Cake with Ice Cream was not as good as I expected and the cake was overcooked and dry outside but chocolate filling has not melted.  Service was so so. Maybe more waitstaff needed on a busy night?"}
{"text":"I liked the pizzas because those were thin crusts, not too oily, and offered some unique flavours.  However, we were displeased with the crust being burnt, dry, and hard on the edges.  Could this just be their style?  Otherwise, it would have been great.  We ordered three 12\" sized pizzas for our family of 5 and we enjoyed it anyway.  The Meat Lovers was a hit for our kids.  The Genovese did not have that basil pesto flavour I was looking for.  Did they forget or were they referring to another type of pesto?  Firenze should have been on focaccia but it wasn`t - too similar with the regular pizza crusts the other 2 orders were.  Despite these, I finished 5 slices with a San Pellegrino.  For pizza fans and aficionados like me and my husband who loves Italy, it was a big miss for Nonna's that evening.  However, having a gelato bar (or it could be ice cream) is a good reason to swing by after a hyper-active day at nearby Richmond Green and try their sandwiches and pastas while at it.  Its a good place to hang out with friends and family, trendy sit-down with some traditional appeal.  Nice & friendly service.  They offer wine (!), which one of us will have to do without next time (assigned driver would really suck, lol).    See photos I posted.  :)"}
{"text":"Most horrible customer service ever. My 2yr old was asked to put away his snacks because no outside food it allowed? I'm sorry but I ordered him a meal as well as for myself not like we are came and are eating outside food without ordering anything. I don't even have issues in Michelin restaurants and I have to hear it from a small joint in the burbs? Please. Save yourselves the time. Not family friendly. Will not be returning and will be making it known my Terrible experience at this \"Nonna's\" place."}
{"text":"Good restaurant.  I come here somewhat often never too impressed but never disappointed. There is some stuff that I'd stay away from on the menu. For example, the sandwiches are hit and miss, I'd generally stay away from them.  Pizza are decent and you may opt for a calzone with any of the pizza toppings. I've also tried the pastas, obviously not like home made but pretty decent for a quick-restaurant type atmosphere.  For Italian, there are lots of places I'd go before here, but that's not to say this is a bad restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh wow this is great pizza! I had lunch with a friend and got to talking and next thing I know I've eaten the whole thing! Light years better then pizza pizza! Thin crust awesome sauce and fresh ingredients. Yum! Please open a store in Toronto.  Please!"}
{"text":"Any place can boil some pasta in water, throw it in a sauce pan and call their food Italian. It's a shame really. This place however is a cut above MOST, but not all for me. This is B class, real authentic Italian food. What is B class? It simply means you cannot compare this to a 5 star Italian restaurant in Yorkville, as some other yelpers have done. Two totally different worlds.   Visiting several times, I have been able to sample the pasta, pizza, bread and arancini (rice balls) here. Every single dish has left me happy and full and it is why I continue to keep coming back here.   Why I didn't rate it a 5 star? - the prices on some dishes are a bit high - the place is small, resulting in long waits"}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant for Italian food in Richmond Hill! I've been here a couple of times already and still love it. My favourite is their lasagna - super soft and their tomato sauce is amazing! I've also tried their pizzas and they're really soft and delicious. The dish that I've tried and probably wouldn't get again is the carbonara - it's on the oilier side and the flavour isn't for me (I've had better carbonara elsewhere). Finally, the service is exceptional. I would recommend calling in during busy times like dinner so that you can check the wait time and availability of tables for your group. Overall - super recommended!"}
