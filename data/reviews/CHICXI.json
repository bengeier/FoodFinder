{"text":"Soup is fantastic. You may need to add some salt if you like higher taste. 

Rice dishes are delicious. Make sure to mix the rice with sauce nicely first. 

One of the best bun I've ever had in Toronto.

Every dish was served quickly."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just that I came on a good night, but everything was made to order.  You can literally hear the roar of the stove after you order. Chinese cuisine puts a lot of emphasis on trying to serve the dish right after it is cooked. Taste was great but a little pricey.  Stay away from steaks.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good food, but non-professional service. Their soup is a must try. 
Been here 3 three times.

Btw I hate Yonge St.  Its a terrible location if you drive."}
{"text":"I wanted to spoil myself today. So I took myself here for lunch. 

I've ordered the ???????? ??????

Free Range Chicken Soup, Fish Maw, Sea Conch (Limited Daily
The soup was very flavourful, however not enough fish Maw, I think there was only 1 piece plus a tiny one.

Moving on to the ??????
9 Foie Gras Har Gow. The Foie gras was mince and the shrimp didn't taste good. It has a weird taste. For this dish, maybe a 1 star.

Tea, it is a green tea bag. They charge you for the tea.  I've tried to order a glass of wine, the waiter forgot about it. 


?????? ??????
32 Premium Braised Fin Lo Fun (Limited Daily) 

The shark fin tasted good and it was a good portion, the sauce was flavourful, except that it was a bit thick. Overall this is my favourite of everything I've ordered and it is nicely presented with tealight and a nice stand.

Stir Fried Vermicelli, Alaskan Crabmeat & Egg

The flavour of the vermicelli was good, however not enough pieces of Alaskan crabmeat and the crabmeat is frozen. The actual flavour itself is good.

The non dim sum dish appears to taste much better and the service can definitely use some improvement. Overall, interesting restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tried the following dishes.

Premium braised fin Lo fun: basically it's braised shark fin on rice. It was light. If you like shark fin you may like it but for $32 I won't order it again.

Ramen, porcine cartilage & slow cooked bone soup: ok. I will prefer going to a ramen restaurant for ramen .

Special marinated pork cha siu: this was quite tasty. The pork was not as tender as the ones from other restaurants like Dragon Boat or Skyview but the owner said this is because they use all natural ingredients to marinate it.

Cod in hot stone bowl was delicious. Tiger Prawns in Salty Egg Yolk/Stir Fried XO Sauce With Asparagus, Chinese Kale with Mashed Garlic Sauce, Bamboo Charcoal with Salty Egg Yolk Bun were all okay, similar to what some other restaurants offered.

The service was good. Parking near the restaurant is not convenient. The food is a little pricey but worthy a try if you are in that area."}
{"text":"5 star chicxi. Upscale Asian fusion restaurant with gorgeous decoration and impressive food.
The best Chinese fusion meal I have ever had.
Dim sum taste amazing but more healthy. 
Recommend special marinated pork and premium braised fin lo fun. 
The restaurant redefine the Chinese food. Good quality, good taste and healthy. 5 star."}
{"text":"Food was Ok and service was not bad, we had a dish of dim sum, still frozen inside, they exchanged it without questioning.

But the tips is calculated after tax? Come on, stop playing this kind of trick as other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Everything are so gooood!!! I don't understand why the other people give it like that bad rating. Everything taste so good for me."}
