{"text":"Good pizza. Now that it's been renovated and has new owners etc, the pizza is pretty good. I'll order some more pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Decent, but overpriced.  I didn't feel there was anything special about Demore's.  It's not \"bad,\" but it's not good enough for me to go back.  My friend and I walked in to place a takeout order at 5:00 pm on a Tuesday.  We ordered a large (12 cut) plain cheese pizza ($10.99), an Italian calzone ($10.25 + $1.50 because he added 2 toppings, which are $0.75 a piece), and an order of breadsticks ($6.99).  The gentleman behind the counter told us it would take 15 minutes.    We sat there for 25 minutes (I made sure to look at the clock on my phone).  I personally didn't mind that our order took 10 minutes longer than we were told it would, but for the purposes of reviewing the place-- it was a Tuesday night, there were 2 people working the kitchen and neither one of them seemed to be moving at a very rapid pace, and we only saw 3 other customers the entire time we were there.  So, busy or not, be warned that their concept of when an order will be ready might not be accurate.  The pizza was good, but nothing that would make me want to order from them again.  He liked his calzone, but he wasn't impressed with it, and was disappointed in the portion size based on the cost.  The breadsticks were a joke.  Seven dollars for 8 SMALL breadsticks that were about as tasty as something I could've baked from a Pillsbury can is outrageous.  I did like that they had a pretty glass container of water with lemon on the counter for customers, though, and it was fun to sit there and watch them prepare our food and toss pizza dough.  I would say try Demore's if it's convenient for you, you don't mind spending a bit more money than you would at any other local pizza joint, and you don't crave any dessert options (no dessert menu whatsoever); but if you have to go out of your way to get there, you'd prefer something more fair in terms of cost, and/or you might crave a cookie or something, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about DeMore's for a while and have never stopped by until today.   The atmosphere was comfortable, everything was very clean seeming and there were some tvs playing an assortment of news/soaps/ads -- not bad.   After contemplating the menu for several moments my wife and I ordered a medium pizza with jalape√±os, mushroom & pepperoni + an appetizer of fried mushrooms (dine-in). I got a soft drink and my wife asked for a cup for water, which was just the same as the soft drink.   Within several minutes of sitting down with our drinks our mushrooms came out -- piping hot, and delicious (I also got a side of some great ranch). Another several minutes and the pizza came out -- looking fantastic and tasting delicious as well. You could tell the ingredients were fresh and the sauce tasted homemade. The crust was also a great texture, crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside.   The staff was friendly the entire time and chatted with us as they closed out our bill -- which was super on point for how quality the food and experience was.   All-in-all it was a great first experience and we will be going back for more -- I was directed to their homemade hot sauce next time we stop in to fulfill my spicy-tooth, I am sure to give that a shot soon.   Hopefully this review doesn't change as I try new things at DeMore's, but given my first experience I am pretty confident they will continue to stay a 5 star to me."}
{"text":"I placed an online order for delivery of onion rings, pickle chips, cheese balls and a medium supreme pizza. We did not get the usual condiments (ranch and marinara) because those were an extra charge and I had ranch dressing here.  Even though the time given for delivery was 55 minutes, our order was delivered in less time. The cheese balls were good, the pickle chips were usual and I just didn't like the onion rings --batter fried rather than breaded.  I could only eat a couple pieces of the pizza --the sauce is much sweeter than I like --so much so that it makes the pizza inedible to me."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza, a meatball hoagie and a antipasta.  I was pleased with the food.  It lost a star bc when I went in to order the guy said 15-20 mins.  I went home and put away some groceries I bought.  Came back after 20 and the meatball sub was just getting in the oven and the salad wasn't made yet and my pizza was done.  I was there for an extra 30 mins.  So almost 50 mins but I hope it was just a one time oops and will try it again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place. Their IG always had mouthwatering food pics. I ordered online, you can't see how long an online order will take until you submit it. Tweaking this would be nice but I waited the hour to go pick it up. When I arrived they made a small pizza instead of the medium that I ordered. I also ordered loaded steak fries, there was some confusion on where those were but were soon located. The lady adjusted my total based on the different size pizza, she comped my ranch and I was on my way. Now to the good... the bacon on my fries was mostly over cooked, on the very of burnt. The pizza (buffalo chicken) seemed just on the cooked side of undercooked/cooked. It didn't look like the IG pics. The taste was ok, it was missing something. Next time, maybe I'll try reg pizza and see how that goes."}
{"text":"First, I really like multi-generational family businesses.  I have been eating pizza and steak hoagies here since high school (many moons ago).  It is on the main drag of Millvale with ample parking.  This generation has repainted the building and remodeled the interior.  When I am visiting my family ... I always order a steak hoagie.  The remodeled site is family friendly and affordable.   They also deliver."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved into the area and have been on the hunt for a good place to order pizza/subs. We haven't had much luck until now.  We have ordered from here twice so far and have been really impressed! The first time we got subs, which we picked up and they were delicious. The next time we got pizza through delivery and it arrived fast and we really loved it! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My son enjoyed the Buffalo Shrimp Pizza a few weeks ago and was just telling me about it.  Nice clean place, friendly owner, great food...!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all! I had the eggplant hoagie and it was the perfect amount for the price. Only suggestion I would have is that the eggplant was very thin  hardly could taste it. Customer service was very nice."}
{"text":"The last two times we ordered delivery our pizza was so burnt. Like, really burnt. It's normally decent pizza when it's not burnt, but that seems to Be the theme recently."}
{"text":"I ordered pick up here recently. The staff was pleasant both on the phone and in person. The dining room was very clean and roomy that I could enjoy possibly eating dinner there. This was the first time I've ever ordered here. We got two pizzas, bread sticks, a sub and wings and it was a little more pricey than other pizza shops. The pizza was terrible. I couldn't even eat any more after my first bite. The bottom of the pizzas were burnt and neither had any flavor at all. The wings were okay, I wasn't a fan of the sauces we got but I wanted to try something new so that's my fault. As far as an Italian sub that's a little hard to screw up. The only thing I would actually recommend out of all the food I got was the bread sticks. They were perfectly balanced with butter and garlic. Honestly if it wasn't for the pleasant staff I would only rate one star but it's hard to find decent customer service these days."}
{"text":"The pizza is soo good.  I came here during lent and got a special Buffalo Shrimp. It was very good. Staff was very friendly and catered to our choice of television station."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by Demore's Pizza and grab a quick bite to go.  I got an Italian Hoagie Pittsburgh Style (fries & slaw on sandwich) and an order of their Hot Cheese Balls. The place seemed clean, the staff was very pleasant, and the food was really good.  I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Still awesome here at DeMore's Pizza!! Wife & I enjoyed another great garden salad and Eggplant Parm Pizza!  We promise to someday try some of their other great food, but that pizza keeps sucking us in like a Giant Black Hole!  Truly the Best Pizza we've enjoyed in years!!  Shout out to manager, Chuck who's very friendly & personable, and the kitchen/pizza staff are hard working and turn out great food!  Check this place out soon!!"}
{"text":"As many of you already know, my wife and I are in a life-long quest to find the perfect pizza. No, this isn't it but it sure was good. Our benchmark is a pepperoni pizza. The crust was very good. Thin with a crisp crunch. It had a good flavor as well. The sauce was spread a tad too thin but was nicely balanced with spice and had a little acidic finish.  And the pizza was huge. The only things we didn't like was that they could've added more cheese (Make sure you ask for extra) and the pepperoni was thin and cheap. I would've paid more for thicker better grade meat. On the whole it was a very good pie well worth the visit. If you live in the area find and try this place. By the way, the subs looked great."}
{"text":"DeMore's is our go to pizza place! Great Pizza, Hoagies and wings! Good customer service. Wouldn't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Ask anyone that lives in the area where they want Pizza.... it's Demore's. The best dough, sauce, EVERYTHING. It's pricey without coupons, a little shabby, and you won't get a please & thank you... but it's all so damn worth it. I get the large square with chicken, It's THE BEST! They put fried chicken on their pizza's! I mean.. come one, it's a give in."}
{"text":"Just tried there Eggplant Parm Pizza!  Really Really Good!  You must try it!  Not surprised they won Best Pizza in Pittsburgh with that pizza!  We also got a pepperoni and sausage pizza it also was very good!"}
{"text":"*This was my first time going to DeMore's and my review reflects my experience there today. I definitely plan on going back!   My husband and I decided to have lunch at DeMore's pizza after I told him I was craving pizza. We walked in and were greeted by the man at the counter while we scanned the menu. They have a variety of different things: pizza, calzones, hoagies, wedgies, salads, variety of appetizers, and more. We settled on a medium pizza (pepperoni, mushrooms, jalape√±os) and some fried mushrooms.   We got a side of ranch for the mushrooms and it tasted homemade and super creamy. You could tell the ingredients on the pizza were fresh, and the crust was the perfect combination of soft/doughy on the inside with a little crunch on the outside. My husband ate most of his crust and he usually never eats the crust on pizza! The price was affordable and the staff was friendly. We will definitely be going back to DeMore's Pizzeria!!"}
{"text":"Damn great pizza joint!! Ordered delivery many times then got a pick up,  very clean and new. Love the classic Italian hoagie (dressing on the side)!! Nice menu with value of choices.  Very happy with new owners, they really did what was necessary to revamp the place. My go-to pizza order place now.    BOB N. makes the greatest pizza in the Burgh!!!"}
{"text":"New vegetarian here, so wanted to try the eggplant parm pizza. OMG! Absolutely amazing on the taste buds! 2nd time ive gotten pizza from this place and its been exceptional. Thank ya folks !  Will be back more times for sure."}
{"text":"Years ago I ordered from this place and did not like anything I received.  The store was re-branded and possibly under new management or ownership so I thought I would give it another try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only do their hoagies have great value, the pizza was good as well.  Their rolls appear to be bought but their pizza dough appears to be made in-house.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.  I am not sure why other reviewers say they are over-priced.  A 13\" $8 Italian hoagie?  I just checked 5 nearby Italian joints that I order from and their Italian costs:  16\" 9.99, 15\" 11.99, 16\" 9.99, 13\" 9.99, 16\" 10.54.  And 75 cents for toppings on a large?  That's a good deal when the guy right down the street charges $1.50...  Good job, you got a new customer!"}
