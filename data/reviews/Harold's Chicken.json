{"text":"I really enjoyed Joyce G's review.  It got me out of bed, off my can, and without Pre-ordering, went there to experience the place.  I can not recall a more honest, down-to-earth place to get freshly prepared, excellent chicken.  If you expect fast-food speeds, go get your hormone-infused chicken at a national chain.

The people here are excellent!  Not a chain!  If you don't have 15 minutes to wait for excellent chicken, please call in your order in advance.  I am willing to invest in this establishment...based upon the quality of the food & the atmosphere.

The customers that came in while I waited for my order were acknowledged, and welcomed.  The staff actually cared about their customers, and the quality of the meal.  I opted to skip the wings included with my order, and they actually reduced my total bill to reflect this change.

Nowhere, will you find better chicken and staff honesty than at Harold's!

Please realize that this is a small, owner-operated establishment that will give you exactly what you desire...if you can give them a bit of time to prepare your meal, only after you place your order.  Anybody that has been raised on chain-food, will be excused for their impatience...at their loss.

PLEASE...call in your order...and enjoy a great chicken meal...in the store or to take-out.

{"text":"i had a high expectation for this place, but yet i was let down. i placed an order over the phone, ordered the 6 piece chicken. ended up being around $10. and once you'll sit down and open up that box, you'll be in a world of shock! they got wings so small that you're mother wouldn't believe her eyes! the cashier (she's the owner, i'm predicting.) i couldn't believe she hid her baby under the register! my lady and I was trying to enjoy our chicken, then all the sudden. we heard a baby crying! upon observation, it was coming from under the register...yes, believe it. a chicken shack turned into daycare service. and the funny part, as we're eating. the chef walks out and calls me a fool( i'm sure he calls everyone a fool, whoever he sees) like get with the program, if you're representing an establishment you gotta be professional! and not insult a customer. the verdict, sad to say. i've experience better chicken, popeyes is still the best."}
{"text":"I've never been to any of the other locations of this chain, so I have no idea if this place lives up to the authenticity of the Chicago locations.  Who really cares, though?  The chicken is, hands down, the best fried chicken I have had in Madison.  I am tempted to take my food to KFC and eat it there, just so all their patrons can see what they're missing out on.

Why only 4 stars?  A number of reasons.  First, the sides I have tried are subpar.  The coleslaw is bland, but they literally give you a cup containing two bites of it so that's fine.  The plain white bread is a pointless add-on which exists solely to remind you how inexpensive your food was.  The fries are almost totally flavorless; this is the first time I can recall wishing my fries had MORE salt.  There is a slight potato flavor and nothing else.  

The bootleg-DVD guy referenced by other reviewers is indeed present on occasion.  He's a little disconcerting, but I guess he adds character.  Or something.

If by chance you stray away from the chicken-oriented sections of the menu, you probably won't be disappointed.  The three-piece perch was good, but since I'm used to shoveling down the 4-piece chicken, it was on the small side.  The cardinal rule for the menu appears to be: if it was fried fresh for your order, it will be delicious.

I hope these guys stay in business!"}
{"text":"Delicious fried chicken! Great seasoning and not the least bit dry. The breast pieces were a good size. Definitely call ahead to put in your order. I called about 15 minutes in advance and it was ready when I got there. Also, they smother all their fried chicken with sauce so if you like your chicken crunchier then ask for the sauce on the side.

Like others mentioned the sides are a bit odd -- a forkful of coleslaw, piece of wonderbread and some fries. I wouldn't go back for the sides but the chicken was worth it!

I don't think I would ever eat in the restaurant - rough atmosphere - but there are tables and a tv.  Much more of a to-go place. Certainly a family owned business which I like to support over the big chains."}
{"text":"After having my mind blown from trying Harold's Chicken Shack for the first time in Chicago, I was severely disappointed when I came here. Granted, Harold's seems to have started in Chicago, but I did not expect this much of a difference in taste for almost twice the cost. Specifically, they do not use Harold's signature hot sauce, only normal hot sauce, and their chicken is much less flavorful and a little drier than in Chicago."}
{"text":"First visit to Harold's.  The posted sign says 20 minutes, I think it was longer.  My 1/2 Mix Chicken was very good even though it was somewhat over cooked.  Maybe the fryer temp was too high because the white meat pieces were tasty and the dark meat pieces were delicious.  The breast was full size not bisected like the white suit guy places.  The sauce was very good, too.  
Next time I'll try the catfish as well as getting more chicken and a bottle of sauce.  I'll also phone my order in so it'll be closer to ready."}
{"text":"I know its a chicken shack.  I knew what to expect.  But really? A couple was before us in line that had already ordered.  We stood there for 5-10 minutes with not so much as an \"I'll be right with you\" or \"It will be 15 minutes.\"  If they had tried to communicate or even take our order and take a long time, I wouldn't be writing this.  After we walked out, \"bootleg DVD guy,\" as he so eloquently seems to be known, came outside after us and asked if we wanted to order anything.  Nah, I'm good.  I won't hold my breath for Madison to get a decent chicken joint.  

A week or so before this, we tried to place a to go order on the phone.  No answer after a few calls.  We decided to just go there.  It was closed during normal business hours with no sign or phone message.  Fool me once..."}
{"text":"So absolutely thrilled to have a Harold's in Madison! The one here is just as good as the ones in Chicago. Best fried chicken, chicken wings (mild sauce of course) anywhere in Wisconsin as far as I'm concern... Make sure you get a grape pop with your 6 pc wing order."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken--like homemade when you are too lazy to make it or are sick of the chemical taste of KFC.

The service was prompt and courteous--anyone who doesn't expect to wait a bit for fresh fried chicken doesn't know how to make it--totally worth it.
The catfish was perfect--will be back for more!

So happy to finally have a good chicken place in Madison--not like Popeyes where you need paramedics on standby."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed. My own fried chicken is MUCH better. This chicken is fried way too dark for me and unlke some of the other posters, mine wasn't very moist on the inside. Mine definitely could have come out of the fryer about 3 minutes sooner. The skin was not appealing at all. It almost seems like maybe they need to change the oil a little more often.

Believe it or not, Cub Foods had the best chicken in town--it was Madison's best kept secret boy do I miss it!"}
{"text":"MHMMM. I sure love me some fried chicken.

Hands down the greatest fried chicken in Madison. Service wasn't great the first time but attentive the second time.

Picture yourself walking into a small looking store as the heavenly fried chicken smell wafts over to you as you're getting out of the car. You can hear nearby cars (sometimes) blasting rap music and people just sitting in their cars. You walk in and you see a ghetto counter, a ghetto menu with a Pepsi logo on it; a real hole in the wall. Just add a bootleg DVD guy organizing his collection and a crying baby in the backroom and you've pretty much experienced the beginnings of Harolds Chicken Shack.

I got a 4 piece mix and my friend got a 4 piece dark. It's fried fresh, so just because of that it's better than KFC. Don't get me wrong, I like KFC, but there was an authenticity that it lacked that Harold's totally nails. It almost woke me up like \"Woah. Have I really been eating KFC all these years without having experienced this?\" The skin is very crispy and the meat is nice and tender. My favorite is both the wings and the legs.

The fries are pretty decent hot, but once you neglect the fries for a few minutes (because you're so concentrated on the chicken!!) they aren't as appetizing anymore. The best thing is making a fry-chicken-hot sauce wrap with the plain bread (what else would you do with it?) -- which are downright awesome.

The bootleg DVD guy sat right behind us with his tub of marker-labelled DVDs, which was actually pretty funny. I was tempted to talk to him, but I ended up decided against it.

One thing that I don't really like is that the phone-ordering service doesn't really work. I tried calling twice but neither times have they answered. Most of the time I would just prefer to order quick and leave, but I guess it doesn't always work out for them. Oh well.

I haven't even tried any of the other things yet, can't way to try the fish next which I hear is also quite good. A MUST visit."}
{"text":"Less than expected.  Chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside, but bland tasting.  I ordered their sauce, but ended up with only ketchup.  Fries were soggy, oily, and horrible.  It took a good 35 min for my food.  Overall, very underwhelming."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best chicken in Madison. The prices are great and everything is fresh unlike KFC (is that even chicken) and Popeyes. Order ahead of time so you do not have to wait. Sides are decent but it is the chicken that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My experience with Harold's Chicken Shack has been akin to the search for the holy grail, Monty Python version. As long as you don't go out of your way, and know that it could be closed at any time of the day, you might possibly experience holy chicken heaven. 

It felt weird seeing Chicago related paraphernalia on the walls, just because we're in Wisconsin, and FIBs, and the Wisconsin Minnesota game was on. But true to legend, our 1/4 dark order was crispy, juicy, and Matt W.'s pro tip to use the white bread as an oven mitt was helpful. The mild sauce had a little tang and sweet, and the coleslaw was refreshing but on the sweeter side. Fries were crispy and well seasoned, and since we asked for sauce on the chicken and not on the side, the fries got a little helping of sauce too. 

It helps if you shop regularly at the Woodman's nearby -- just swing by and see if anyone's inside or if there are customers milling around. Seems like Saturday around dinner time worked for me. The neon Open sign and store hours mean nil."}
{"text":"In terms of the food, Harold's really deserves 4 stars, but the unstable service quality definitely drags down the whole experience.

I usually get their fried chicken dinners or fish and wing dinners. The chicken is for the most part excellent. I've had a few times where it over a bit over done and dry, but most of the time, it's fine. Their fish has a corn meal coating and it's actually really delicious. Very light. The sauces are ok. The mild is like a sweeter sauce and the hot is a less buttery version of a buffalo sauce. I always get my sauce on the side, so my chicken doesn't soak up the sauce and get all soggy. I once showed up to a potluck party with one of their wing buckets, I was definitely everyone's favorite person that day.

On to the service part. So if you go in and order, it usually takes about 15-20 min since they fry upon order. I'm fine with that, I like my orders to be fresh. But like most people, I don't always have the time to wait, so like most people, I try to speed things up and call in the order ahead of time. Uuummmm...yeah, about that...if you call to place an order it's like a 50% chance no one would answer. This happens throughout the day/evening. Also, even though there are no mid-day closed hours posted, I have physically went there during off peak lunch hours, but still acceptable lunch hours (like 2pm), and the doors would be locked, but open sign on! Not sure if employees are playing hooky and boss doesn't know, or they can just randomly shut down. Back to the calling in orders. So there's a chance no one will answer, so you're thinking, maybe they're THAT busy...so once i went there, after unsuccessfully calling. I walk in and there was one other customer there. ONE! Yea maybe I just missed a huge frenzy blah blah.....or maybe they really need to work on some serious employee training."}
{"text":"I was happy to find that this place doesn't stray much from the great Chicago tradition of Harold's Chicken. Want a fountain drink? You get a styrofoam coffee cup. Need napkins? Here's a roll of toilet paper. Bread? We've got Wonder Bread. It all sounds lousy but it is part of Harold's charm and I wouldn't have it any other way. So quit bitching about Bootleg DVD guy. Buy a damn movie or let the man run his business.

There's not much to say about the food that hasn't already been said. The fried chicken is fresh, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. Coleslaw is also some of the best around but be sure to get a larger order, since the standard side that comes with your chicken is about the size of a ketchup cup. Personally I like the wonder bread: wrap a piece around some chicken and dip it in the hot sauce - it really cuts through the spiciness and makes for a delicious chicken sandwich.

Yeah, the service is inconsistent but I've never had a problem there just dropping in, getting my chicken order and leaving. They've gotten all my large orders right. But then again I've never dined in, done anything to warrant getting called a fool, or tried some stupidity like trying to order right when the store opens or closes."}
{"text":"This is the single best fried chicken on the planet. The only thing missing is the bulletproof glass."}
{"text":"The food here is great and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the 1/2 white meat chicken dinner. The chicken consisted of two sizeable breast cuts of chicken, well-seasoned and bathed in just the right amount of sauce, and two wings, which were smaller but nonetheless delicious. 

I dock it stars for what I consider horrible service. After ordering I sat around the restaurant, waiting for my chicken to be prepared. While I waited, a large gentleman with a case of bootleg DVDs waited in the front of the store for the entire time while I was there. I never saw him order and he never received any food. I have no idea what he was doing there.

After about five minutes of waiting I asked for a glass of water, The attendant behind the counter got me a class, but acted as if I had offended him by asking. Later when he removed an order from the back I asked him if it was my order and he said \"No fool. This is mine.\" I am not making this up.

A few moments later he walked out from the back with his order and tells me that I am spilling my water. I looked below me and did not see any spilled water. I checked by the fountain to see if I had spilled there. I hadn't. I checked the shelf behind me and found that indeed there was no spilled water. I don't know what the attendant was talking about, though I did get the strong impression that he was trying to intimidate me.

Finally, the wait for the chicken should have been 10 minutes. Mine was 20, and it wasn't really that busy. I was in a hurry and this made me late.

So yeah, there's some real solid food here, but I hope you don't have to wait around for it while the staff tries to intimidate you."}
{"text":"This chicken was delectable. As a Harold's connoisseur from Chicago, I know my fried chicken. This Harold's actually seasons their chicken, making for a splendid feast. I would want a tad more sauce, but more can simply be ordered. The manager is a great man who understands food. 

I give this Harold's 5 out of 5 clucks!"}
{"text":"I don't know about the staff being intimidating... they seemed great to me. As for the wait, they do make it up fresh so 10-20 minutes is the norm. Call ahead and they'll have it ready for you. The chicken is tasty, but sadly the fries are just frozen fries and nothing special, I wouldn't recommend ordering them as a side. They do have an HDTV that was tuned to ESPN while I was there so it made the wait not too bad. 

It does have the authentic sketchiness of a chicago chicken joint. There was the strange man there selling bootleg CD's (and who knows what else). There was also a guy selling what are likely \"midnight runs\" (basically the chinese/other asian factories make extra of whatever they are contracted to make and sell them on the black market) of nike shoes."}
{"text":"Not too bad!   Just plan on waiting for the food....not in a bad way.   They make the dinner to order so everything was fresh, hot and tasty.   I will visit again when I am hungry for some great fried chicken.   My only complaint was that they only had soda in a plastic bottle.   No refills and poor choices.   The service was above average and decently friendly."}
{"text":"As a lover of fried chicken, I was super excited to learn of this place. I am also a huge fan of hole-in-the-walls so was doubly excited when I pulled up. It can be tough to find but is located on Gammon across the parking lot from Woodman's. It's in a short strip of shops including a U.S. Cellular shop and India House both of which have much more prominent signs on the side facing Gammon. 

We walked in planning on taking our food to go. There was one person in line ahead of us so we figured it would be no big deal. The guy working the counter was very friendly and explained that a second worker had called in sick so it might take longer than usual. We ended up waiting nearly an hour. I wanted to leave but my friend insisted we wait it out. The inside is a bit dingy and no one came in to eat their food there. We watched a lot of people come in and pick up orders long before ours was ready. Once we got our food the guy explained about how everything is made to order and, of course, orders-phone or in person-are made in the order they are taken. To slow things even further was the sick co-worker situation leading the one guy to answer the phone (which seemed to be ringing non-stop), take walk-in orders, cook and ring people up. 

The chicken, as promised, was excellent. The fries were nothing special. I'm not sure the chicken was worth the hour wait. If I come back, I'm definitely phoning my order in ahead of time."}
{"text":"We ordered to go.  
I really wanted to like this place as we are looking for a good chicken stop but we have mixed feelings.   The prices are right but they fry their chicken differently than what we are familiar with and rather dark,  seemed like it was over fried.   Still, the Chicken was moist and had good flavor.  The coleslaw too was quite good.  
We ordered hot sauce and mild sauce and got all hot sauce unless their mild sauce is still quite spicy.  I couldn't tell the difference.
We don't like wonder bread as a side.
I do like a place where I can get fried chicken livers.  So that is nice.   They have a number of fish selections that I might try some time.  But no mashed potatoes-bummer.
I think some people will like it and some people won't.  Thankfully, their chicken doesn't have that weird Kentucky Fried Chicken aftertaste.
I was hoping someone would come out from the back and call me a fool but sadly that didn't happen."}
{"text":"Let me start with:
4 stars on the chicken, hood mentality. 
3 stars for the catfish, decent service when you get it and attempts to run a small business. 

Chicken is seasoned well but cooked a bit longer than I prefer. 
Catfish has no season but the meal does and it's more authentic catfish than JJ's

NO STARS for the CRAP INCONSISTENT SERVICE AND I SPECIFICALLY ENJOYED THE FACT THAT THEY ARE UNABASHFULLY MISTREATING EVERYONE.

Told ya~ I'm equitable. 

My first visit: Chicago in Bronzeville. Rain came and I had to scurry away. 
So no chicken. (Summer 2012)
Second attempt, Naperville. Place closed (Feb. 2012). 
Third attempt, Good Ole' Madison location. Got 3 wings & waited. Tried to dine in but it's dark so I wrap things up and leave. Decent flavor. Didn't know they took cards so I came prepared with cash as my Chicagoan friends trained me over the years (and this was finally my first purchase). Sweet kid took my order. Accepted it was my first visit which took him aback. Explained the menu to me and the \"sauce\" and \"slaw.\"
Got good service =) 

4th attempt: Read the YELP reviews, LAUGHED OUT LOUD (literally) and looked forward to returning. This time - the wings were dark at the joints showing bruising. No worries~ I'll talk to the guy that appears to be the owner.  BTW: I looked and listened out for the crying baby and the dude claling everybody \"fool.\" I eagerly patronize equal opportunists - it's time for MADISON to have such a place. lol
At this visit, I'm taught to call ahead and no wait necesary. 

5th attempt: Remember that call ahead directive?!? The hell. 
No answer after 3 attempts. No visit. 6th attempt = store isn't open. Wasted trip.
7th attempt: Call, no answer for 2 separate calls so we'll go over which we see they are open but chatting on the phone. So we left - no order. 
At this point: I'm disappointed but not bothered. It's what can be expected.

8th: My word. This last visit accomplished with my own personal discipline could not do NOR Boot Camp. I'm done. Here's the deal:
1) Inconsistent pricing. Man this burns my buns. Read the Diva review if you think I'm playing. The menu says one thing. The person ringing you up will say another. At the end, if the girl is ringing you'll pay more $2.99 for one piece of catfish, $2.75 on other days with her and $2 with everyone else. 
2) I'm okay with the baby at work. Gotta do what you gotta do. On a to go order that I called in 15minutes ahead & got the Wednesday special - took 45minutes. 
3) She leaves and dude comes in. Rather than him taking new orders that came through the door - HE CHANGES CLOTHES TO GO SIT OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN. This was a serious down pour that Wednesday. Comes back in dripping. 
4) 2 boys leave out with their order complaing about the wait and scared of the area
5) 2 men that ordered at the counter but not ahead of me get their food so of course mine must be ready - I called my order in. NOPE~ 
5b - No one thought it would be smart to cook all of our orders together. 
6) The cook is on his cell. Upside his head - no bluetooth just jammering away
7) Wet owner comes back in bragging how he loves the rain and couldn't resist.
8) BOOTLEG DVD man never offered to sell me anything. \"Why won't any bootlegger try to sell me anything? I'm black\"
9) The latest customers to walk in are confused as heck. Wet owner walks by us all dripping. 
10) My special is finally ready - I ask for the drink. He says they're out of cups ...DRIPPING EVERYWHERE still... then offers me a throw away cup about 4oz with no lid. 
11) Girl with baby comes back and we discuss the price differences. What she said, what's online and what he said. And how just last week I paid less. 
12) She tells me the website is wrong. The prices shouldn't even be up. I'm like I know y'all went up on the chicken prices but there's no way $3 for a piece of catfish. I challenge him and he says to her, \"Baby she's right. I didn't charge her that before.\" My thought: Oh well for today. Keep it. 
I had to laugh to myself, smirk to them - said thank you and left. 

Initally, I thought my beauty shop folks were just being Chicago Hood and Proud when they said Harold's is \"falling off\" (this means loosing statuture) but I guess they are right. That bad chicken made me leave the wings alone and try the 1/4 white combo - only breasts which are fantabulous. But this last visit is just that.
ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK."}
{"text":"Harold's is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get...

A week earlier, Harold's flakey operating hours foiled a lunch date between Miss Joyce and I.  The sign on the door indicates Harold's opens at 11 AM, but at 11:40AM, the door was locked and the lights were off.  Just Harold's being Harold's, according to Miss Joyce.

Fast forward five days:  I'm making a Woodman's grocery run and see the lights on and customers filing through Harold's door.  Throwing caution to the wind, I dashed through the front door and thus began my maiden Harold's experience.

The employee working the front counter greeted me and handed me a menu.  It didn't take much time for me to decide on the  1/2 chicken dinner special (2 thighs, 2 legs, 2 slices of white bread, cole slaw and fries for $6.99) with the hot sauce on the side.  Because everything is made to order, I was told my food would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes.  No problem, I sauntered over to Woodman's and grabbed the handful of items on my shopping list. I returned 20 minutes later, grabbed a seat and after my lunch was delivered to my booth.

SWEET
BABY
JESUS!

When I looked down upon my newfound bounty, I realized I just entered fried chicken heaven.

The sides of the flimsy cardboard serving tray were bulging from the sheer mass of my order. No anorexic birds served at this chicken shack.   My first attempt to tackle one of the drumsticks results in burned digits - confirming that this chicken was fresh from the fryer.  No heat lamps...check.  

Pro tip: the white bread served with the dinner order has amazing insulating properties - use it to protect yourself when making a move on the first piece of chicken.

The exterior boasted a crispy exterior shell that gave way with a loud crunch on every bite.  I learned that Harold's still uses  1/2 beef tallow /  1/2 vegetable oil in its fryers.  The seasoning was spot on as well.

The interior was the juiciest chicken I've ever had.  My server left a dozen napkins on the table for good reason - I had juice running down my hands and dripping down my chin.  

Pro tip 2: Do not go to Harold's on a first date or before a job interview.

I absolutely loved the tangy cole slaw.  It had the right balance of sweet and sour elements and had a wonderful crunch.  The only negative is the thimble-esque serving size.  More cole slaw please!

The fries were the weakest link of the meal - a little soggy but well seasoned.

Unlike the colorful encounters experienced by my fellow Yelpers, my visit was uneventful.  Nobody called me fool and the bootleg DVD guy was nowhere to be found.  The server came by and cleared my table.  On the way out, she politely reminded me that I could order ahead next time if I didn't want to wait the 20 minutes.  However, I was only paying partial attention.  In my mind, I was already planning my return trip next Monday when the  1/2 chicken (dark meat) dinner is only $4.99."}
{"text":"I first had Harold's on the south side of Chicago. Needless to say, I was thrilled to see one in Madison! The food is great, and the service is top notch to boot. The people crying about being called a fool need to get thicker skin. Obviously the byproduct of \"Everyone gets a trophy\". Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Such a Gem!  Located in the Woodman's West parking lot. I am so elated to have such great fried chicken in Madison.  I had the 2 piece white chicken with fries and coleslaw for 6.99 and my husband had 6 wings (the whole wing, not just the drummies), fries, and coleslaw for I believe 6.99 too!  Hot sauce on both.  We took our meals home (about 15 minutes away) and the chicken was still crispy.

My only complaint is very small, the portion of coleslaw you get with the meal is very small (maybe 2 tablespoons), so order an extra side for $1.00, its worth it!

I was surprised by the decor and cleanliness.  Everything was spotless and I enjoyed the aluminum on the walls.  Service was also wonderful: kind, helpful, and warm.

We will definitely be going back!  It will make shopping at Woodman's enjoyable."}
{"text":"It gets five stars for the fried chicken alone.  Chicken is perfectly breaded and crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  The sauce is great too.  The sides are throw away in my opinion.  We got lucky when we scored a Harold's out of Chicago.  Call 15 minutes ahead to get your order on time as everything is made to order.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is totally worth a visit. You won't be disappointed. Awesome chicken! You might even be able to catch a movie ;-)"}
{"text":"I don't know what these other people are talking about but we absolutely LOVE Harold's chicken it's by far easy better then any fast food or other restaurant in the area the chicken is juicy and flavorful as well as the catfish we eat takeout from here at least once a week! Yes the restaurant may not be the most upbeat professional place but get over it if u want good fried chicken and fish ull go to Harold's chicken! Will never eat KFC again!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else said, it is really good fried chicken.  For like 8 bux you get 2 big breast pieces and 2 full wings bread and fries and a dash of coleslaw.  The bag weighs a couple pounds when you get it.  

Yes you have to wait, only because it is made fresh.  The store needs a sign though and yes, it looks like a daycare, there was a baby behind the counter but its part of the experience I guess.  

It looks like they have pretty good specials throughout the week though."}
