{"text":"Surprised to see this place rated 4 stars on Yelp. I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening for a quick bite and we found our meal extremely substandard.  The draft beer and wine lists were solid and the cocktails were pretty good, so no complaints there. The food menu was focused, but one lingering question hovered over us while we browsed it:  Where the hell is the bacon?  For a restaurant with pork-themed fare, there were disappointingly few dishes that contained bacon. Plenty of pâté, tenderloin and belly but no bacon. It just seemed weird.  The cheese plate was very tasty and reasonably priced - $10 for three cheeses, toast points/crackers and small samples of red wine poached pears and roasted beets. The beets were the only thing out of place on the plate, and although this was the high point of the meal, it's hard to give Black Pig credit for something extremely difficult to screw up.  For the entree, I ordered the croque monsieur ($13) and my girlfriend ordered the pork tenderloin ($19). My sandwich arrived and was ENORMOUS. The thing was slightly larger than my face and came with a mountain of \"pommes frites\" (Black Pig's terminology). It looked like something Adam Richman should tackle on a Man Versus Food challenge.  The huge portion size to price ratio couldn't save the uninspiring flavors. The fries were ridiculously salty and I didn't even bother taking the sandwich home despite leaving about 3/4 of it on the plate.   Despite costing $6 more, the pork tenderloin dish was much smaller and tasted as bland as it looked - plenty of brown and green on the plate but very little flavor. The pork was juicy at least, so not a total loss.  Overall it was an extremely disappointing experience. The food couldn't live up to the menu, which overhypes its descriptions with meaningless adjectives - \"free range\" toad-in-a-hole, \"nettled\" risotto.  We'll probably come back for drinks, but my advice is skip the food."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Smells delicious. We had reservations at 8:15pm and weren't seated until 8:30pm - most restaurants would just shrug this off, but chef/owner Michael Nowak personally came out and greeted us and then comped our table the braised rabbit app (which melted in our mouths! so delicious) Great customer service and attention to detail. Our server (Leonor G) was amazing! The perfect balance between making sure everything was perfect, without hovering. The kind of service you might expect from a white linen, fine china type of establishment. We also had the gravy frites (poutine for those north of the border). Highly recommended. The beet root salad was light and refreshing. Tasted like it was freshly picked that day. The braised short rib could not have been more tender and juicy. We normally try a restaurant we haven't been to before when we go out, but The Black Pig left us wanting for more. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey, but pretty darn good too. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pretty chill for the tier of cuisine offered."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and a great wine selection, but is lacking in ambiance.  My mom and I were seated extremely close to other guests and could barely hear each other because it was so loud.  We both agreed that the restaurant could become 5 stars if the waiters were more conscious of guest's comfort, if the restaurant was set up in such a way to manage the noise better, and if they could rethink the interior design (e.g. improve the lighting and, put art on the walls, etc).  Incredible food, but I believe that when you pay that much for food, it is partially about the experience. Probably wouldn't go on a super romantic date here, unless the ambiance is improved, but overall great food."}
{"text":"I was so hoping that The Black Pig could match up with its predecessor in the space (Dragonfly).  The food was tasty and the drinks good.  Service was attentive, when they had something to serve.  Sadly our party of four waited an hour between appetizers and our entrees.  The staff tried to make up for this by comping us for desserts, and manged to mess that up by bringing desserts for 3 of the 4 people.  Skip the Black Pig and go to Soho Instead"}
{"text":"Wonderful balanced food.  Each one of our meals featured a different homemade sausage.   It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner there on Saturday. The chilled corn veloute (a cold corn soup), was simply out of this world - it was like drinking a fresh corn on the cob. The Ohio Beef was outstanding too - particularly the short ribs - very tasty and they melted in my mouth. The Vegie Ban Minh sandwich shows they treat non-meat eaters as 1st class citizens too. Great beer list, and a nice vibe completed an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"I went here recently for my birthday dinner.  I was surprised when I walked in because other reviewers have mentioned how different the place looks from Dragonfly, but I have no idea what they're talking about.  It's still the bar on the one side and the dining room on the other, the main difference now being there's a big pig painted on the one wall.  Service was great, food came fast.  We tried the rabbit and the duck appetizers.  The duck was ahhhhmazing, and I'm not usually wowed by the bird.  The rabbit was interesting...it was terrine, which is like a pressed meat loaf(which I didn't know, but it's my fault for not asking) and it is served cold.  Not bad, just very different.  For entrees I got the pork schnitzel and the man got a burger.  Both plates were fantastic.  The burger was perfect.  The portion of schnitzel was huge and so flavorful.  On top of everything else we tried their signature drink, the sticky pig.  It was delicious.  It was spicy from ginger, sweet from the booze, and refreshing.   I give this place two enthusiastic thumbs up."}
{"text":"The setting is warm, inviting, terrific long bar with superb handcrafted cocktails served up by long time bartenders Allison and Hunter. Wine selection not extensive but definite European flair with Hunter showing his \"sommelier like\" knowledge pointing us towards a Brunello and BTR Fornio we all enjoyed.  There was nothing our small group of 4 did not take a liking to. Appetizers - The Charcutrie Board, and Pork Rinds were certainly worthy of an upscale place, followed by the Apple Salads, Beet Root Salads, a side of Bread which seems to have been fried on both sides of the the thick white flaky slice. This might have been the highlight of the meal (strange as that may seem). Roasted Chicken, Flank Steak, and Short Ribs all excellent. For dessert I really enjoyed, although I could not tell you what in fact it was - was the Miso Butterscotch cup. Delicious and unique. Apple tart also excellent. Almost went for a chilled dessert wine, but it was getting late and we called it an evening. Great place. Definite return next time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The brunch here is particularly delicious, and I highly recommend a cocktail called So Fresh and So Green, Green -- sort of a green Bloody Mary, but with an Outkast twist replacing the Queen of Scots."}
{"text":"Really hate giving this business such a bad review, since I've been a longtime fan, repeat customer, and taken friends and family here. We (3 people) came in for brunch at 11:20am this Sunday and even though we did not have a reservation were seated promptly. That's the only positive. The hostess warned that there was a reservation coming in at 12:30 and we assured her that we would not be hanging out.  While watching tables seated after us get attention and drinks from a server, we were given 3 refills of water, but did not see our actual server until 15 minutes after being seated. While a little disappointing, we decided to plug ahead with our full order, including a coffee, 2 omelette, and a Black Pig Benedict.  The initial cup of coffee came out promptly, which I emptied, but then sat empty for 10 minutes before being refilled. After another 10 minutes, our server came over and politely said, \"I just checked with the kitchen and your order will be out super shortly\". Needless to say, super shortly must not mean within a few minutes, since our food finally arrived at 12:20pm, a full hour after our arrival and more than a half hour after placing our order. To add insult to injury, the 2 eggs on my Benedict were entirely broken and slopped all over the plate, rather than presented on top of the Bennie, leaving the dish to look like grilled pate on muffins and accompanying potatoes in a soup of runny yellow liquid. Additionally, from approximately 12:10 until the point that our food arrived, the hostess repeatedly did a visual check of our table, we assume to see if we were finished, when we hadn't even received our food.   The food was tasty and always has been.  However, it wasn't until we were readying to leave that our server offered the only (and relatively weak) apology about the time it took to get our food, apparently not recognizing that she was also lacking in attentiveness.  We decided to comment upon the disappointing service and time to get our order to the hostess and another associate as we exited, who only chuckled and said \"yeah, we don't know what's going on back there.\" Really disappointing. Since we really value our meals out, work hard to justify a relatively expensive brunch, and have several other great options in the Ohio City area, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here before for both brunch and dinner.   Brunch wise... Entrees are rather underwhelming and uninspiring. However, they offer pitchers of mimosas for $12. Each pitcher makes four glasses. It's a great deal.  The appetizers here are in my opinion the best things on the menu. You can never go wrong with the toad in a hole, pork underbelly, and gravy fries.  Our food took a while to come out, but maybe that is because of the new location and they are still working some kinks out?  As for the new space, it's definitely bigger. The front is the best part. Nice big old windows, exposed brick walls, amazing bar. The back kinda sucks though--it's carpeted."}
{"text":"We came here really jazzed because of a previous review that said the cocktails were excellent, but we were honestly underwhelmed.  The food and drink were more expensive than most but were average at best. Ordered the chicken and was not impressed.  The server was nice, attentive, and cordial.  If you're going to drop the cash and are on W 25th I'd go somewhere else first."}
{"text":"We started with the trio of meats including a pork pâté with house made pickles, duck prosciutto with pickled onions, and chicken pate with blueberries.  All 3 were delicious but came to the table a good 10 minutes after our friends appetizer.  Our server was very nice and apologetic and in their defense, the restaurant didn't have but a few empty seats anywhere in it.   Next came the pork schnitzel, which was dry but seasoned well.  I had the burger, medium, with the tomato compote and slice of green heirloom tomato and moribier.  Juicy and delicious!   Our friend liked the kale Caesar and it was a nice twist on the tradional salad.  He also enjoyed the chicken entree. Nice beer and wine selection and prices were reasonable.  Friendly staff, the open kitchen and the view from the deck help make up for the shortcomings.  I like to give a place 3 months to get their staff and menu fine tuned while working out the kinks.  As they've only been open a month, I'll be back to see how things progress."}
{"text":"My husband and I did the chef's tasting menu -- 5 excellent courses, accompanied by a bottle of well-chosen wine: Beet salad; pork rillettes; pate; all great. The front of house could have used some additional polish - \"haricots verts\" was mispelled as \"hericot vert\" on the menu, and the salad had at least deux haricots - and the server seemed a little green but charming and very on-the-ball. We'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here while bar hopping in Cleveland. Incredible drinks and great service. The Black Pig is low key and inviting. I will be stopping by again for a \"sticky pig\". I highly recommend it and look forward to trying the food."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! One of the best burgers I have ever had... Crack cheese and some sauce that's amazing, short rib hash also crack, and French toast has a Carmel banana sauce with bacon, enough said... it has bacon..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love going to The Black Pig on special occasions, so naturally we decided to visit the new location for our anniversary.  Everything was incredible!  The new space is very elegant and much more romantic than the 25th location was.  We sat in the front dining room and love the charm of the paned front window and interior design details.  The menu felt very refined and mature, in the character of their new space.  Our favorites (charcuterie, house made sausage, pork belly, cheeses and truffle dessert) were still in the mix, along the some enticing new options.  We tried the heart tartare and were very impressed.  I am looking forward to visiting again soon with  some of my girlfriends to try the chef's other new additions to the menu.  I have some food allergies, and the server and kitchen were very knowledgeable and accommodating.  I love that the new menu subtly includes notations about which items are gluten free!  At the end of the meal, to top it all off, the chef showed us their new private dining room on the second level.  Hats off, Black Pig!  You continue to impress us.  Congratulations on your new space."}
{"text":"I know it's close to closing, but when your website says you serve till 11pm, I shouldn't call at 1036 and be told the kitchen is closed, especially on a Saturday night. I previously wrote a negative review about this and decided to delete it out of neighborhood friendliness. But with this being the 4th time we haven't been able to order from the restaurant at the corner, this one will be staying up. I still gave two stars because their brunch is fabulous. Trying to catch them for dinner is basically impossible if you are anywhere within 90 minutes of their posted closing hours. Irritating and unprofessional. It's not even 11pm and I had time to review the menu, get excited, be denied, and write this review."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sticky Pig cocktail which has a little kick from the ginger beer.  It was good, but next time I'll say with a regular Manhattan instead.    I started with the Braised Pork Belly which was great but it's kinda difficult to mess that up.  :)  I had to order some kind of pork since I'm at a restaurant named The Black Pig.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes pork belly, but I will probably try another appetizer next time.   I had a glass of Pinot Noir with my entree, Ohio Beef - Grilled Bistro Steak and Braised Short Rib.  My steak was perfect medium and the short rib was very tender (could be shredded with my fork alone).  I'd definitely get the Ohio Beef again.  Yes, it wasn't a cheap meal and it wasn't huge typical-Cleveland-sized portions.  Those people who complain about that should skip fine dining and go to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, and our server was very helpful and informative.  I thought the menu was creative, and the food overall was prepared well. I had their version of \"Adult Mac n Cheese\" which completely lacked salt of any kind. That was disappointing. But everyone else's dishes in my party were great!  We had the charcuterie appetizer which was fantastic.  Cocktails were well balanced and delicious."}
{"text":"I think this is one of those places where it really depends on what you order. If you are looking for fun drinks, then this place has them. The atmosphere is very cool and I got the kobe beef burger with these marinated pickes.....Id go back just for this burger. Our service was very good and overall we have a really good meal.  Ive only been here once so I cant speak to other things on the menu but what we had, everything was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I been here previously and really loved the place. We were celebrating a birthday with my son and wife from Boston. We ended up doing the chef's table. We were all very impressed. Each plate he (the chef) brought out was incredible. My son and wife lived in Paris for three years and have eaten at several Guide Rouge rated restaurants and we have also when they visited them. One of the plate's was of an incredible cassoulet that was better then anything we had in France. What an great experience. Highly recommend the place unless you are a steak and potato person then go out to the burbs."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday at 4:30 to meet a friend for one drink before going to a wedding reception. After sitting at the bar and being ignored by the bartenders for ten minutes, I was told told that they didn't open until 5PM and that the group of people at the other end of the bar with drinks in their hands were still there from brunch. Absolutely terrible way to treat someone who wants to give you business. I live across the street and will never step foot in that place again.  Town Hall is two blocks away and they treat you like family no matter what time it is."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal at the black pig. Our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful, all of her recommendations were wonderful. We had the full charcuturie board, the duck confit appetizer, the bon mi, and the house sausage. All of these things were great. Additionally, they have some great cocktails."}
{"text":"Awesome......our kids had been and recommended so we did.  A tough menu to chose from on a Sunday.  My wife chose the schnitzel with potato salad.....3 large crispy pieces that were great over great potato salad with tasty bites of bacon.  Luckily she could not eat it all so I had had some for lunch the next day. My lucky choice was the croquette Madame....awesome and huge. Great flavor and perfectly done, the egg on top was a plus.  Had some of their brown gravy on the fries.....wow."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here and our food was awesome! Had the pork rinds, mushroom agnolotti and the pork chop - everything was great and we loved the cocktails too. It has quickly become one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to the new location yet, however I remember the old location on 25th being amazing. Always loved that they had more game on the menu than your average restaurant (can never pass up rabbit on the menu).   With that being said, last time I dined here I had the short ribs and they were phenomenal. It was a really dynamic atmosphere as well as, cozy but came across as formal or informal. I loved their rooftop patio as well.  Can't wait to get over and try this place again at the new location, looking forward to the fact that it's off the beaten path from 25th...especially on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Beautiful sunny day. Big happy hour sign out front advertising roof top patio. Seated and ready to order, when server informs us happy hour is only in the bar....awkward, so we stayed...no sign, no note on menu. Disappointing. Will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Bahn Mi, I like you, a lot. It might be soon to come out with all these feelings after we've just met but it was love at first bite.  A heavenly sandwich with a sensational combination of flavor and texture. I'd definitely order this again!   The Ratatouille hash was forgettable. The Bacon and Mushroom Snitzel was so flavorful!!!! The little toast pieces that come with it are soft and moist and buttery. Oh darn it, I'm salivating again. I always do this to myself."}
{"text":"Two big -porky- thumbs up for Black Pig's Happy Hour.     Not crowded at all on a chilly March, Tuesday evening.    The Happy Hour red wine was smooth and velvet-y.   The HH frites were lick-the-plate-good.   Can't recommend the little pate sandwich - thought that was a miss.  I will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Definitely one of the better options to eat in the Ohio City area.  They have some of the best pork dishes I have eaten."}
{"text":"A nice spot for lunch after a trip to the West Side Market.  The \"Pig\" has a decent beer menu and while the sandwich selection is limited and  can be a pit pricey for a casual meal, the Bahn Mi was delicious (as was the veggie version).  The decor is of the \"brick wall loft\" style but it all works and along with the bar setup and unique food offerings, the place is a great addition to the list of new, hip dining spots on the near West side.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"An overall great experience. Service was quick. Food was solid. The Ohio beef and the duck entrees stood out.  Gave it 4 instead of 5 for not having bacon"}
{"text":"Love everything on the food menu. Perfect roast chicken and great Banh Mis too. Comfortable atmosphere. Amazing fries!"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with The Blind Pig which is considerably different.  Another McNulty joint on W. 25th that is kind of but not really connected to Nano Brew.  This place is ok I guess.  It doesn't really have a theme of any sort.  There is banh mi on the menu alongside with mussel and anise flatbread and pork schnitzel.  The menu is small and all over the place.  Good beer list and some interesting house cocktails that were delicious.  I had a burger that was pretty good.  Oh yeah when we walked in we were told there was a 45 minute wait to sit outside on the rooftop.  After some persuasion they let us up there and there were 5 empty tables and they told us they don't take reservations for the rooftop.  So what the fuck is going on there?"}
{"text":"I enjoyed an awesome meal with my family last week and have been recommending it to friends ever since. We had the short ribs, pork chop (it was huge!), pork tenderloin and burger - all of which were excellent.   Additionally, our server was very nice and attentive to our table. Great experience and look forward to going back to try its brunch too!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Cleveland! Delicious consistent food!!!!Came here for brunch this morning and sat out on the patio. Our servers name was Cara and she did an excellent job. She came to us with many suggestions and even was nice enough to write down one of the drink recipes is that we really liked. We both had three drinks a piece and each drink was awesome and fresh! The food was outstanding and consisted of the Benedict, bahi mi and the short rib hash! The short rib hash was the winner but all were delicious! Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Excellent food. Place was packed and if our food had arrived in less than 30 minutes I would give this 5 stars. Great place."}
{"text":"I went to the Black Pig late one night after Velvet Tango Room. Their late food availability is great. I had the gravy frites, toad in a hole (eggy in a basket), and a salad that I think had fruit and nuts.   The salad was not my favorite, but the fries and egg in a basket were great. My friends ate up my fries so fast that I was glad I had ordered other things as well.   Had a mixed drink that I ended up not liking, but at that point I didn't want to drink more anyway. Service was good. We sat at the bar and it was kind of busy but not many people were eating that late so the food didn't take long.   Overall it was pretty good. I want to come back and try brunch."}
{"text":"My 4 stars- not the friendliest staff, but overall good food (excluding the herb omelette- don't order that.)   I came for Sunday brunch with a group of 4. The first thing that struck me was that the first staff member who came to our table didn't speak a single word to us, he filled up our water glasses without a single 'Hello' or 'Good Morning.' The waitress also wasn't the most friendly person, as she seemed to be annoyed that we needed a few more minutes when she came to get our orders. After this however, she did make sure our coffees were filled at all times. When we ordered, our food took 45 minutes to arrive to the table. It was Sunday brunch, however, they didn't look overly busy. The table ordered a burger, the bananas foster French toast and the 2 eggs breakfast- everyone loved what they ordered and everyone finished everything. I unfortunately ordered the herb omelette- it wasn't very good - omelette with herbs and brie, which I could have easily made at home."}
{"text":"In keeping up with the current trend of fine-ish dining, The Black Pig is a slightly gimmicky experience with a lackluster appetizer selection.  That's not to say the food is bad, far from it, but after having dinner there, I couldn't help but to feel a sense of \"been there, done that\" afterward."}
{"text":"First time. Lived up to the reviews. Great atmosphere. Service was excellent. Pork tenderloin and chicken fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Service was attentive. Good quality food. Especially like their charcuterie. Nice bar selection. Nice to visit for Brunch. Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"I went to the Black Pig and left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.    I ordered the beet salad for an appetizer that was primarily composed of tough, bitter greens.  On top there were strands of beet, but they were missing the vibrant purple hue and sweet flavor of a good beet.  I'm assuming that both of these were locally sourced which is a mistake after a long hot summer.  Chefs need to pick and choose more.  Local vegetables can be bad too.  For my meal I got a burger, which was fine, but overcooked.  They tried to add some stylish accouterments, but it ended up falling flat.  A Bar Cento burger is better and cheaper (esp. at happy hour!); he should have just recycled that recipe.  My girlfriend got the scallops which consisted of 4 scallops and 5 pieces of asparagus ($5.50 per scallop).  She thought they were somewhat overcooked and didn't have the smooth buttery texture you'd expect at a nice restaurant.    To sum up the Black Pig: small portion sizes, high prices, pedestrian food.  You'll be better served going anywhere else on W. 25th."}
{"text":"I love me some black pig brunch! I would give this place 5 stars hands down! Unfortunately the service no so good.. if you're hungry enough and love great food.. you won't mind glancing for the service to see you can get their attention and one more damn cup of coffee! The food is definitely outstanding. Take your time to make an online !"}
{"text":"First time here - no need to return.  Wine list was minimal (and not great with what was offered) entrees were just ok - service was AWFUL - I asked the server (and you know who you are) to explain the menu since it was our first visit - she rolled her eyes, huffed, then rushed through her explanation leaving us wondering what the menu is all about - took forever to bring drinks - others bright our  food - others refilled water - I've never been so angry spending $100 for 2 people for dinner as I was last night.  Asked to speak to manager/owner/anybody - got nobody -'left angry"}
{"text":"Oh my yum! We came her for brunch and everyone in our group of seven loved their meal. I had the two eggs. I don't know what they do to the potatoes, but it is pure magic. I could eat a breakfast of just that. It came with three slices of bacon that were super yummy.....and this is coming from a person who isn't a big bacon eater. Service was great and would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"I cannot give a rating.....and this is why.....we have stopped here twice recently, once for brunch, once for dinner.  Both times we were turned away as they said the place was full.....2/3 of the tables were empty both times.  The hostess was also very curt, bordering on rude.  This is confusing to customers who are present with money in their pockets standing in the doorway......turn away a good paying customer on the chance that a reservation will show up, and you have open tables in more than half of the restaurant?  We will never go back.  There are so many options in the neighborhood.....who wants to bother with this place?"}
{"text":"I always know when I like a place if the next day I am thinking about when to go back.  As a bourbon with 2 cubes only drinker, I was being brave trying the Sticky Pig, and it was worth it.  We just had a couple of appetizers and they were both flavorful, they were heavy but what do you expect from a place with pig in name.  I am not sure why I am not giving this a 5 other than I rarely do.  Our bartender was Tiffany and not only was she awesome and easy going about us just having a couple appetizers, but when we said we were going to try other places that night, she gave us like 4 suggestions.  To me this is confidence in your place and a love of your city.  She deserves a 5.  Suggestion is to make happy hour 4-7.  We missed it and cost is double."}
{"text":"I remember going there a while back, it was a weekday, fairly early, the place was dead and they said they couldn't seat us without reservations, we could only sit outside. So we did, they forgot about us out there, so we, in turn, forgot about them and left the restaurant. Skip to a few years later I thought I would give them another chance. Same snobby hostess, horrible overpriced menu, not worth the effort to walk in the door. The \"simple salad\" was bitter greens piled with bitter radishes, covered in bitter dressing~ it's a side dish and it was 8 dollars for that tiny pile of trash. The menu is one page. Just a bunch of sandwiches and overpriced meat. I am glad both my experiences were so horrible so that it is now firmly etched in my brain, \" never go to the black pig ever. NEVER AGAIN! \""}
{"text":"Our experience here was stellar.  Don't believe the haters.  Started with the pork belly appetizer.  Amazing!  It melted in my mouth.  As entrees we tried the pork tenderloin special and pork schnitzel.  Unlike \"Jeffrey V.,\" we thought the pork tenderloin was great.  Flavorful, moist, cooked perfectly.  The accompanying risotto with super fresh peas was also excellent.  The pork schnitzel followed suit with a great combination of flavors, preparation was also excellent.    To top off a great meal we tried the fresh doughnuts with bourbon infused peaches!  Simply amazing.  Crispy outside with fresh warm center followed by some amazing peaches.  A great meal!  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This was our first time at The Black Pig- a Saturday night dinner. We were sat in the front where it was a cozy, intimate atmosphere.  The back of the place seemed a little quieter and open.  The cocktails were great! Both Pimm's cup and Specialino were interesting and balanced.  We started with the pork belly which was everything we had expected.  It's a fatty, juicy, pork bomb.  The homemade mozzarella complimented it nicely.  For entrees we had the porkchop and steak frittes. There was a significant lag time between the appetizers and the main dishes, maybe an hour.  We ordered another round of drinks and weren't bothered but it did feel too long. The porkchop was a good porkchop and I enjoyed it.  Whatever came with it puzzled me... It might have been the cocktails but all I remember is some cold, fried, green thing with melted cheese.  It didn't hit the spot.  The steak was cut into medallions and cooked just right.  The fries and garlic aioli were awesome.   Overall, the service was attentive and the atmosphere was great.  Price was about right. We'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I got the black pig burger which was cooked perfectly and was delicious but my husband got the fois gras sausage and even I thought the portion size was ridiculously small. It was one sausage on top of a minuscule apple strudel and nothing else on the plate except for a couple tablespoons of a cabbage sauerkraut. Hardly a full entree and not worth the $19. Service average. We are in the neighborhood so will come back and hope for improvements."}
{"text":"We have heard nothing, but lovely things about the black big and hadn't yet had an opportunity to go. So for my husbands birthday we decided to check it out and we were not disappointed.  I did the three course tasting menu and my husband did the pasta tasting. Each of our courses were delicious with the highlights being the hangar steak and the gnocchi.  We also really enjoyed the cacio e peppe and the butterscotch pudding.  Service was casual, but efficient. We ordered cocktails from the bar which were delicious - beers were a bit pricey for the selection.  I would definitely recommend for a casual dinner or a low key celebration meal."}
{"text":"For anyone who truly appreciates food well done, please go. All the dishes were well seasoned, great depth of flavor, and carefully  flavor combinations were imaginative. The presentation was spot on. The pork was locally sourced and the prices excellent for the quality. Please skip those upscale chains and dine here."}
{"text":"Pig everywhich ways! Just delicious! This place is great. only there for brunch this time. There are so many other things i want to try. Def a place to go back to next time were in Cleveland'"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times. I have been for Brunch, Lunch, Dinner and Cocktails.  I am a huge fan of the Short Rib Hash, Free Range Toad in a Hole, the Black Pig Burger and I could never forget the White Sangria! I will keep coming back time and time again.  Don't forget to stop in during their happy hour T-F 4pm-7pm & Sat 12-4pm. They have $3 canned beers, $4 wines and $5 food items!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying out Black Pig for the first time and sitting on their roof-top patio with a view of the city.   The service was incredible and the food completely matched it. Our server was knowledgeable about the cocktail list and made a recommendation based on my preferences -The Looking Glass - that drink was divine!   I had the braised shortribs and they were the essence of comfort food - falling apart as soon as your fork hit them. Our server even boxed up my leftovers and recommended making hash out of them for breakfast (apparently, that's what they do for their brunch service).   My date got the special of the seared pork chop with creamed corn. The pork was done perfectly without being too dry and had a beautiful glaze.   I also have to recommend the chocolate truffle dessert. I never thought I would like white chocolate, but I'll eat it there with the truffle oil. An overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Great food! Start with the pork belly appetizer, it was divine. Something I crave now from time to time. The burgers and bahn mi are really good too. Service is accommodating and helpful for the most part. This is one of my favorite places to eat at in Ohio City now. Yummy and right in my price range, don't mind if I do."}
{"text":"What a gem in Ohio City! It's slightly outside of the main stretch of W 25th, which gives it a quiet, cozy feeling while still being easy to get to.  Unsurprisingly, given the name, the pork menu is a real standout here and it definitely deserves its own place on the menu; however if you're feeling carbs you can't go wrong with the pasta tasting menu. This may be burying the lead, but this is also the only place I've ever seen Goose Island Bourbon County on the beer menu! (They had the 2017 Barleywine when we were last there in late January 2018.)"}
{"text":"I haven't been in a few months, but I was shocked to stumble upon Black Pig on Yelp and see that it only had 4 stars out of 5!  Black Pig is probably my favorite restaurant in Ohio City. Brunch or dinner, the food is always solid and sometimes downright amazing. I have been to Black Pig at least a dozen times since it first opened on W 25th. Now that it's over on 28th, it probably gets less foot traffic, but the food and cocktails are as good as ever. I strongly recommend this place if you're a meat fan - they always have interesting selections. The best meal I've ever had here was a duck leg. It was nearly life changing. A little on the pricey side, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"We finally made it to the new location last night and it was fabulous! The atmosphere is very similar to the previous location which made me happy.   We started with the amazing charcuterie platter which we can't pass up when Chef Nowak is involved. Nobody does it better. Everything on it was delicious but the standout was the chicken liver pate surrounded by butter. Genius...reminded me of Paris.   Next was the blue marlin crudo for me and the chicken livers for my husband. The crudo was so fresh and flavorful.  The chicken livers were corned then fried which made for the best chicken livers ever. Yes, I'm saying that and I don't typically eat them.   Our main courses were the pasta bolognese and the Berkshire pork. Both were to die for. The drinks are also fabulous. If you haven't tried this place, you need to.   Nice job Chef! And thanks Branda...you are always fab."}
{"text":"1/6/13:  We've been trying to get to this place for months and we finally made it last night and I'm glad we did. It was awesome!    If you aren't familiar with the chef/owner Michael Nowak, he is amazing. He was the chef at Bar Cento (one of our favorites) and Market Garden Brewery before opening this place. He is one of the best in Cleveland.   On to the dining experience.  The atmosphere is energetic and the decor is modern. The food was superb. Here is a listing of what we had.  Pork Belly- Not too fatty and quite tasty Simple Salad- Light and fresh with plenty of radishes Gravy Frites- Fries were perfect.  I was hoping for more cheese like a poutine, but it was great anyway. Duck Confit- Soooo good!  The parsnip, raisin side went perfectly with the duck.  Black Truffle Spaghetti- Housemade pasta with a creamy egg yolk. Enough said.  Toad In a Hole- The truffle really paired nicely with this dish.  Macarons- I love them and get them whenever I see them. My fave was the pistachio with salted caramel.   Did I mention the drinks were inventive and delicious too?  I highly recommend this place!  A great addition to the Cleveland dining scene.  Update 2/23/13: We had the pleasure of dining at Black Pig again and I have to say, it was just as fab as the first time.  We tried entrees this time- pasta with pork and celery root puree and the pork special which was a giant pork chop with giant beans and frisee.  Both were so amazing.  Couple the amazing food with the energetic atmosphere and you have a perfect night.  I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Price = 4 Experience = 4  nice mixologist behind the bar... nice preserved old building.  Great super large mirrors with oversized molding as frames."}
{"text":"Awesome, simply awesome food and drinks.  We ordered the tasting menu for the table; calling it a tasting is a bit of a misnomer as the portions were above average in size, you won't leave hungry I swear.  After we ordered the tasting the chef came over to discuss allergies, likes, and dislikes etc. Then the meal started. The food was out of this world good. All of the dishes were extremely well balanced as far as flavors, textures, and presentation.  It was by far the best rabbit I've ever had.  The short ribs melted in your mouth.   The cocktails were equally imaginative and flavorful."}
{"text":"Great cocktails that are strong, the fries were really good, and the short ribs are amazing (good portion and will be filling). The place is relaxed but nice and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"My write and I went here for brunch, and will be going back.   The so-so:  Their take on bread pudding (more of a cake than bad pudding) was good, but a bit dry for my taste. The omelet was solid, but nothing special.  The good:  The pork belly was phenomenal. The simple salad is true to its name, but really makes those simple ingredients sing - I wish more restaurants had salads like it. The ratatouille was one tweak away from a perfect side - the French fries that were in it took away from the rest of the perfectly prepared, perfectly seasoned dish.   The bad:  The service was slow, which is being kind (especially because the place was pretty empty when we dined three).   Overall, I would recommend The Black Pig to any of my foodie friends."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our experience. Took very long and the food was just okay. Our drinks took 35 minutes to come out and our main meal took an hour and a half. The service was slow and blamed it on being busy when the restaurant was barely filled. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. I have to upgrade my review. Gave up on parking for taste of tremont and thought I would try this place again. I am so glad I did. Wow brunch is awesome here. Gluttons breakfast. Mmm. I'm gonna go pass out now.  Excellent. And pork for every craving. Live music. Found my new brunch spot. Also refreshing to hear the cooks in the open kitchen talking about their favorite foods and how to prepare them. Obviously they enjoy food and cooking."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. Where's the pork? Where's the poutine? Where's the schnitzel?  Focus seems to have moved away from pork. Sure, there are a few pork dishes, but it is no longer the theme of the restaurant. Several brunch dishes removed from the menu that I miss from old location. Service was good. Kitchen a little slow, but went on a holiday. Vibe seems more pretentious. Only have dijon mustard in house. No salt on the table.  Odd choice. Menu not cohesive.  We shared several apps and entrées. Pork bellie very good. Chicken livers not crispy, but ok. Too salty. Fingerling potatoes ok. Nothing exciting. Burger incredible. But shouldn't be the star at a restaurant called the black pig. Sausage tasteless. Kids wouldn't eat. They eat all sausage to this point. Pork collar very good. Hash too greasy and salty. Didn't complain because took about an hour to get main course. About 30 to 40 minutes after apps done. Sitting on the fence. Please consider going back to a pork theme. I can get a cluttered, random menu at a lot of places. Bring back the pig with less attitude."}
{"text":"Last night was my boyfriend and I's first time here. I first noticed the cozy atmosphere as we sat down at the bar and were greeted by the bartender. She was very helpful when asking questions about beer styles and tastes. We got the burger ( We split it, we weren't super hungry but hungry enough!) Our food was delivered by the chef himself, and they even split the burger and fries onto 2 separate plates without us having to ask.. He then  asked us if we needed anything to complete our meals ( My boyfriend of COURSE needed more ketchup). The chef did not ask a server or bartender to get it for us but delightfully went into the kitchen grabbed it himself and brought it to us. Oh and the burger was DELICIOUS! The house pickles were awesome! Definitely will be coming back for dinner and or brunch!"}
{"text":"Not a vary big brunch menu but the seasonal omelette was amazing and the toad in a hole was incredible! The portion sizes are small and a little pricey for breakfast. Parking was a hassle to find we had to park like 10 blocks away."}
{"text":"My party of 7 went on Sunday morning. Service was friendly although not fast, but to be fair the restaurant was nearly full. French toast was unusually good, sweet and complex. The pork belly was very tasty. The coffee was good but not great. The prices were excellent given the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I love finding small, out of the way restaurants that serve great food with good atmosphere. We went the weekend after Valentine's day and they ran out of the Pork Tenderloin and Porkchop. I got the Braised Pork Collar and my date got the 3 course tasting meal with a poached apple salad, scallops, and a type of vanilla custard. We also got the house made charcuterie.  The house made charcuterie had a good selection of meats. I'm not an expert but I thought it was ok. The apple salad was ok, just a light small salad.  The braised pork collar was fantastic. It was so flavorful and tender. I wasn't even sure what was on the bottom but it was great too. I would say what it included but can't look it up since the menu already changed online. It felt like a level of cooking I can't fully appreciate yet.  My date liked the scallops, though didn't really filled him up (I feel like that's the case for most scallop dishes.  The vanilla custard was very tasty and unique. It had a fruity gelatinous topping. You could tell they used real vanilla bean due to the black specks at the bottom.  Overall, food was great, would be a good place for a date.  A little pricey, but the quality is definitely there. With drinks, it was about ~$100."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed with my experience at The Black Pig. In general, this place has never really stood out to me or made me wish to come back again. And I so wish it did because it's one of the closest restaurants to me and I am always passing by it! So when I came here again, I was hoping it would be a different story. First thing I noticed was the very little selection of foods and entrees on their menu. My friend even asked if it was the full menu. Secondly, our food took FOREVER to come out and I get it, there was a few of us but the wait just seemed ridiculous (the fact that I was hangry was beside the point). Our waitress wasn't the friendliest and barely came around to ask how we were doing. In general, she had a very stand offish vibe that none of us understood. I ordered the pork belly, egg, carrots and potatoes and even though it was good, it was not filling at all. I was still really hungry afterwards, we ended up having to share our meals between people. The kicker is that everything is kind of overpriced for what it is. The only thing that I really like about this place is the caramelized bacon. But I'd rather do a hard pass dealing with the above mentioned. For being a local and never complaining about Ohio City restaurants, I feel like this place has a lot of work to do when it comes to many areas of their business."}
{"text":"I led a group of 18 out-of-towners to The Black Pig on a Tuesday evening. The staff was fantastic about accomodating us. All courses arrived within minutes to all of us, no easy feat with that many diners. The cocktails and drinks were as great as the staff. Folks raved about the steak, and they did look tasty. Following the recommendation of our waiter Lorainne, I had the pork chop. I come from Indiana, so I know pork. This was as flavorful as any that I'd ever eaten. (It was also the biggest chop I'd ever encountered!)  By the way, after we told the staff of our monthly birthdays, they transformed dessert into a celebration. The chocolate dessert, while wonderful, was overkill. I cant speak for solo diners or couples, but if you're in Cleveland with a-dozen-and-a-half colleagues, you'd be hard pressed to do better than TPB."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  The restaurant decor is very nice, I did like the bar it was beautifully done.  Came in for brunch. Asked if they had iced coffee, (which in fairness I thought was a done deal because you have a cocktail on the menu made with cold brew coffee..) but was given a quizzical look by the waitress and told no. Ok.. Can I have a coffee and a glass of ice please?   Ordered the short rib hash, and the more I thought about it, the more I was like what an ingenious way for a restaurant to pawn off their leftovers. Which is kinda what the short ribs tasted like, leftovers. They were good leftovers, but the hash was very salty and lacked much depth otherwise. The eggs were of high quality which was apparent by their color.  The bruleed bacon was delicious, thick cut and not too sweet.  I also enjoyed the vegetables that came with my husband's pork belly. Those carrots were good.  The pig theme is very cute, especially the piggy paperclips with the bill."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here today.  The seasonal omelette pushed this to two stars as it was pretty good.  The Eggs Benedict was 'meh' - salty too smokey pate, under-cooked poached eggs and too little hollandaise sauce.  First cups of coffee were cold and tasted old; refills were better.  Biggest turnoff was the waitress who had a tattoo on her arm showing a naked girl who was having her nipples twisted by a demon reaching from behind her.  Not really something I care to see at Sunday brunch.  The service was OK but the tattoo and food ruined the morning.  Servers with body art that is of questionable tastes should be covered."}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite meal in Cleveland (Slyman's wins!)  I wanted a nice Sunday Brunch, all the reviews said there would be a line - but we got there right when they opened at 11am and there was only 3 tables occupied in our room when we left-- which I think was an anomaly. It was Cinco de Mayo the day before, maybe everyone was hung over????  We split the banana, bacon French toast  and the eggs benedict (comes with house-made pate instead of Canadian bacon) and a side of truffle toast. (I am not sure what it is about Cleveland - but I saw a lot of truffle flavored things and a lot of pistachio-flavored things...)  The potatoes that came with the benedict were fingerlings and so incredibly crispy we could hear each other chewing them - SOOO good.  Oh and that truffle toast - look at my photos - big flecks of truffle and the butter ran down our chins.   WOW, great brunch! - we met someone at a bar after the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and suggested they go here - I can bet they were not disappointed. Parking was easy and it is only a couple blocks from the West Side market, easy walk."}
{"text":"Brûlée bacon- a must have for brunch aide- short rib hash was pretty good, could have had bigger chunks of meat. The fresh toast was awesome and I'm not a huge sweets person.  Whatever you do- make sure you get the side of bacon."}
{"text":"As the name implies, The Black Pig is a monument to all things pork.  If you go with a group of 3 or more, order the selection of meats and cheeses to start.  It's a great sampling of some seriously delicious offerings, including the outstanding pate and brie, served alongside deliciously crunchy bread and deliciously mustard seed laden mustard.  I've also had the sticky pig, which is a great cocktail and a very reasonable value for its quality.  The gravy frites are also good,  perhaps even on par with Greenhouse Tavern's, but a little thicker and doughier than those offered by Greenhouse.  I'd recommend ordering a sampling of small plates and/or mains to share amongst your group, to help diversify from some of the richer, but Delicious options such as the pork belly (which is great, but can be a little much to take on solo).  The Bahn Mi sandwich is great, and the mushrooms and the hash are both good choices for your side. I have not had the burger personally, but I've heard good things about it as well.        The patio behind the restaurant is great and offers a nice view of downtown, so consider sitting outside if its available.  Service can be a little slow, but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"For my first review ever on Yelp, I had to write about the place that is hands down my best meal ever: The Black Pig.  My partner-in-crime and I went in on a Saturday night and had the Chef's tasting menu.  For only $45, you absolutely can't go wrong.  The Chef was really attentive and friendly.  Every course was more spectacular than the last, and the food was surprising.  We had a delicious beet and fennel salad that I never would have picked off the menu but I'm still dreaming about it.  The house made sausage was perfect and it made me want to lick my plate.   We came in from out of town and I can't wait to go back and try the tasting menu in a new season. I couldn't recommend this place more.  We had a 5-star dining experience at relatively budget prices."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, and the wine list is pretty extensive. It was also nice that not that many EY people were there.   That said, the food was quite lacking for the price. I had the half chicken, which was basically two pieces of breaded chicken with a piece of kale in the middle. As a cook, I can tell they just dunked the chicken in flour, as there was no taste to the skin. Very disappointing for the price.   The waitress staff did nothing more than ask for our order. Didn't ask if our meals were ok or if we would like a refill. Very poor service and I would not recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"A wonderful brunch on a snowy Saturday! Loved the corned chicken livers! The seasonal omelet was perfectly prepared but the star of the show was the short rib hash.. a must try!! The place is cute, warm and quiet. We'll be back, possibly for dinner the next time.."}
{"text":"We had the pork belly to start. Tasty!! Since we were not starving for heavy meat dishes we stuck with sandwiches; their burger which for me, was cooked to perfection and the Bohn Mi which was dynamic and a solid good! However, our side dish, ratatouille hash was a bit too \"creative\"'and lacked every aspect of taste and presentation. this was the only downer to the entire experience.   We shared a signature cocktail and a Pinot Noir. The cocktail was too strong for my palate but the Pinot was perfect! Since we didn't have any main courses it's tough to judge overall, but this is a nice new place with good food options and a nice patio!! I do plan to go back to try their main courses. Overall, it's nice to see some new restaurants in Ohio City."}
{"text":"This review is not necessarily indicative of the caliber of this restaurant, but, for us, it was absolutely terrible. We got to the restaurant for brunch on Saturday around 12:15, we had to be somewhere at 1:45 and wanted to be out of the restaurant at 1:15. We figured one hour would be a tight, but comfortable amount of time to eat. We ordered around 12:30, and absolutely nothing came. By 1:15 we had informed our waiter that we absolutely needed to leave and he explained that everything would be out shortly, when we explained that this wasn't an option he said they would box everything up. After another five minutes of waiting for the boxes, we simply left the restaurant given how important it was that we be on time to where we were going. As a longtime server, I understand that being on a time crunch is an added stress to both parties, but we were hoping that 15-20 minutes would be a decent amount of time for the restaurant to prepare our food and another 20 to eat, pay and leave. I am not sure what could have happened (there are many possibilities, I'm sure), but having not even received food after 45 min of waiting is rather obscene. Beyond that, as we expressed our time concerns, we were given a full check for food we were not going to be able to eat in the restaurant and no manager acknowledged there was an issue. I hope this was just a fluke as I was very excited to try this place. As I am from out of town and come to visit family infrequently, I won't ever be able to try the place again. All I can say is if you have an important engagement and don't have two hours to devote to your meal, perhaps think twice about eating here. The menu looked great and service was friendly if not somewhat aloof."}
{"text":"Amazing. Every bite was delicious. We stopped for dinner before a show at Playhouse Square after reading some Yelp reviews. We were the first people in the dining area at 5:30 on a Thursday but they were filled up by 6:45. Per the server's suggestion (she was helpful in guiding us thru the menu) we tried the Corned Chicken Livers appetizer (4 pieces with beet mustard, pickled shallot)  It was tasty, didn't taste like liver, great flavor.  My dinner selection was the Warm Beet Salad and the Pork Belly small plate. The salad was beautifully presented and so flavorful. The salad dressing was a creme fraiche sauce was spiced perfectly, not salty, and the overall salad was so balanced and tasty. The Pork Belly was cubed, served with spelt dumplings (so light and flavorful!) and a beet sauce. The meat was tender and delicious. The salad and pork paired nicely together. My mom had the Braised Pork Collar and it was to die for! Tender, rich meat served on creamed brussels sprouts. I will dream about the brussels sprouts for days!  They were so delicious - so creative - and balanced the dish. For dessert we shared the Miso Butterscotch pudding dessert, a small cup that was perfectly sized and balanced out our dinner.   If I returned I'd definitely spring for the 3 Course Tasting, great price and a good way to see the menu. I can't wait to return and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with my experience here last week. The food was incredible. The wine list was well rounded and intelligently priced. Service was great, cocktails were very inventive and hip-ly French. I opted for the special Pork tenderloin with brie risotto and some sort of eggplant puree. It was delish paired with a nice glass of Bordeaux. My friend had the scallops which she gushed about. I have found myself fantasizing about my next meal here, time to go back soon."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. First time here, had the lamb Bolognese with Brussels sprouts. Chocolate and rye for dessert. They also whipped up an amazing entree for my vegan wife. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall a wonderful dining experience. The beet salad could have used something to jazz it up a bit such as a splash of vinegar and some nutmeg. The squash soup, pork belly and short ribs were perfection. The scallops looked delicious, but seemed like a scant serving. I wound up giving someone who ordered the scallops one of my short ribs because they still felt hungry. The service was excellent. I recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"We decided on The Black Pig for a celebratory meal last night and were not disappointed at all (nor the other times we have been). We started with the pork belly as an app and were not disappointed. The barley part of the dish was as amazing as the belly itself. Great way to start off. I want with the 3 course pasta dinner with the first course of the braised port tortellini and was by far the highlight of the meal for me! The broth-unreal! Course two wasn't my cup of tea, the pasta a little dense for my liking. Third course was really good as well- i hate raisins but in this dish they knew exactly what it needed for that little sweet note.  My partner went with the 3 course (salad with crispy lentils- wonderful, mushroom pasta was amazing and the spiced pots de creme a nice finish to the meal).   We tend to go early and the place was empty (it was also Tuesday so not prime dining day I know) but beautiful and the service was tops. Our server explained ever dish when it was brought to us and very attentive but not overly on top of us which was great.  All in all a great experience and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while visiting family in Cleveland. Overall a very nice restaurant with good service. The food selections on the menu were very diverse and varied in price which we enjoyed. The wine selection was a bit limited but still had nice choices available.  For dinner we ordered the Prince Edward Island mussels  appetizer, the burger entrée with fries, the pork belly entree with hummus and chic peas and the bolognese."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant where Pork is king. I always look forward to a meal there!"}
{"text":"I've been for dinner twice and it's been great. I went for Brunch on Sunday and had a great time. We went at 12 and it was not very busy. I had the Porc Frites which were great. I loved the pork belly. They had great mimosas. Atmosphere was very laid back and easy. Live music started at 1. Not typical brunch food. Much more adventurous/high end. Pork belly, short ribs, pate and foie gras sausage. Not a place for picky eaters."}
{"text":"4 stars for a first visit here for happy hour (Tues-Fri from 4-7pm! They also have a Sat happy hour from 12-4)    Solid happy hour menu with dishes from $3-5. On the menu that week, most dishes came with pork as an homage to their name! Even the frites have pork belly in it. We got the frites, the pasta dish, pork belly sandwich, and a grilled cheese sandwich. The favorites were the pork belly sandwich and the frites. All was very good.  On Wednesdays, the bartender experiments with cocktails for $5.   We left really full from the food and fun convo with the bartender. We'll be back for more happy hour!"}
{"text":"So after the Christmas ale first pour, I went to here for the 5courses tasting menu. I actually love it. However, I personally prefer the taste to be lighter and the chicken liver and the pork tenderloin sauce are kinda salty to me.  Overall, it is worth a try. The experience was awesome and I will go there again"}
{"text":"HOLY MOTHER OF PEARL, THIS PLACE IS BOMBDIGGITY!! I have serious withdrawals from their delicious food! We came here on a Sunday morning around 11am, and we were able to be seated right away. I ordered the short rib hash, french toast (with banana fosters and bacon), and the spiked coffee. One word to summarize the short rib hash: holy-freakin-delicious!! Just get it. You will not regret it! The meat was super delicious and literally just melts in your mouth. The french toast was great! I mean, it comes with BACON, which automatically makes it amazing.   The portion sizes are humongo, so come hungry!!"}
{"text":"For starters, The Black Pig has to get a sign.  You can't expect to compete with any restaurant if you are missing a sign.  And if you do have a sign, you need to put it somewhere where people can see it.  Anyway, lacking signage aside, everything I tasted here was pretty good.   Not spectacular, not mind blowing...just ok .  By the descriptions, at the least The Black Pig tries to make thoughtfully prepared and creative dishes.  Our group of six shared the \"cheese plate\" which included pork rinds, a variety of pates, two cheeses and some interesting accompanying sauces and dips.  Honestly, it seemed less like a cohesive cheese plate and more like the chef couldn't decide how they wanted to showcase their creativity so they just threw a hodge podge of things onto a plate and presented it to us.  We all just sat there and stared at it until a server helping another table saw our confusion and pointed out what the various offerings were.  After the explanation it was pretty clear that this was not substantive enough to be called an actual cheese plate.   Tapenade with pork would be a better description.  And pork rinds?  Come on.  Also, Black Pig has to step it up on the amount of bread served with that plate.  It'd be enough for two people but definitely not six.  On to the mains!  Our group ordered two veggie bahn mi sandwiches (which came with perfectly prepared fries), two different burgers, the duck dish, beet salad and the kale salad.  The food came out pretty quickly and was presented nicely but those with meat dishes noticed right away that the chef's interpretation of \"medium\" veered way more towards \"rare.\"  Not a total deal breaker but definitely confusing.  I mean, the difference between rare and medium is pretty clear, right?  Not sure how someone could overlook this.  That was the last hiccup to our meal.  We sat outside on the patio (which is really quite spectacular) and sipped our drinks lazily as our meal wound down.  The patio really makes this place stand apart.  The drinks here are great too -- creative mixes that pack a punch.  I'm a wine drinker but sipped a little bit of my husband's drink and immediately wished I liked Bourbon more than I like wine.  It was strong and heady but damn was it good.  All in all, The Black Pig was just ok.  Drinks and the patio are the only reason I'd go back because the food is just not that exciting.  Not terrible by any means but I can't imagine myself ever wanting to go back and have a meal."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have never had any bad food, and everything new I try typically surpasses my expectations. Dinner is great with something for everyone. The burger is awesome and affordable; their pastas are homemade and spot on; and you can find larger and smaller plates to fit your needs. Brunch is equally satisfying, if not better. The bananas foster is bananas (duh)--not too sweet. The fingerling \"home fries\" are potatoes toasted in angel tears, so basically I am going to end with that. Do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"Brunch. Brunch. Brunch. Go for brunch! You won't regret it!   You know when you sit down at a restaurant and have mild anxiety because everything on the menu looks amazing?!?! Welcome to my black pig struggle.   We started with the mimosa pitcher. Yeah- the two of us were feeling feisty. Anyway, that pitcher was $12 and was a bargain! The carafe held five solid mimosas.  I mean, the math alone suggests the craziness of it all... $2.40 for each mimosa? I like this place already! (For the record, if you got an individual mimosa, it was $6. Just put on your drinking pants, find a DD, get the pitcher.)   Food.... My mouth is watering just thinking about it! We got the short rib hash, the omelette special of the day, and a side of bacon. The short rib has was so amazing... So savory! The short ribs were lightened up by the red pepper relish, which in Erick's opinion, totally made the dish! The omelette special was filled with chicken confit, kale and goat cheese- the chicken confit was just amazing. Oh and the bacon was tasty- maple glazed- I love me that sweet and salty!   So because we hadn't polished off our mimosas after choking down, we decided to get dessert. Pistachio cake accompanied by pistachio ice cream and lemon curd. Good god man! It was excellent. Oh- and there was also pistachio brittle on the plate. The brittle was surprisingly salty and added a nice crunch. I got coffee with the dessert, which was a mistake. The coffee was old and cold. Yuck!   Finally, I should mention the Service throughout the meal was solid. I know they have a private room in the back of the joint for parties.... If you're into parties.   Black pig, I will be back again- Definitely to try out the rest of the brunch menu, but also maybe for dinner! I wonder if they have the same mimosa special at dinner... Hmmm..."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service.  Nice place.  All of the recipes for a successful restaurant.  The GF and I enjoyed our dinner and we will be back when in Cleveland. We tried the pork rinds, two pastas and the short ribs. All good especially the chili cheese on the rinds."}
{"text":"Our entire experience at Black Pig was top-notch!! The cheese plate was delicious and varied. The cocktails were scrumptious (and high quality). And the burger!! Oh the burger!  This was quite possibly the BEST burger I have ever had in my life. Black Pig Burger with Shallot Jam, Mushroom Duxelles, Fromager d'Afinois, and Aioli. The smokiness of the minced mushrooms with the sweetness of the jam paired expertly with a perfectly cooked 50/50 sirloin/chuck patty and just-spongy-enough Brioche Bun...OH MY WORD....AMAZING! And I've had some pretty hoity-toity San Fran burgers. This meal could actually make me come back to Cleveland. And Leonor was the sweetest most sincere server! #ohiocity @blackpigcle #foodgasm"}
{"text":"This place was mostly empty for brunch. Not sure why.  Excellent food. Try the Brulee bacon and pork belly! Delicious bloody Mary too! Beautiful decor and great service.  Go!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place before we went, and even the Uber driver we rode there with had heard good things, so we were expecting a lot. Luckily, they delivered! We arrived right when they opened at 5pm and I remembered thinking that I wanted to see what time the place would really pick up (the answer: within a half hour). Our waitress was attentive and anticipated our needs. There was always someone coming by and refilling our waters, which seems super simple, but it's super important and really annoying when a place can't keep my hydrated.   We started with the Charcuterie, and it was delicious. Our waitress even brought us more toasted baguette pieces when we ran out. I treated myself to the 3 course pasta tasting and each plate was seriously delicious! I had meant to take a picture of each one as well because they looked so lovely, but instantly forgot I wanted to do that when they put it down in front of me. I would highly recommend their pastas. I live close to Cleveland's Little Italy, and this place can't even compare their pastas to those restaurants. The pappardelle was exquisite. I'm not kidding. I lived in Rome for 6 months and this place has their pasta down to an art form! If my bank account allowed it, I would eat here 24/7.   We ended up staying for over 2 hours eating, drinking, and chatting. I cannot wait to return to this place!"}
{"text":"The wait was long but we ordered (amazing) cocktails at the bar. Once we finally got our food, the short ribs changed my life. Seriously. Order them."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome. Pork collar is better than sex. Service is great and the atmosphere is so cozy."}
{"text":"Exceptional service to start. Friendly stuff and great food . Did enjoy for the first time a chicken liver app and it did not disappoint. Both of our meals were great with a lot of flavor and great portions. I don't give it a 5 star because I need to comeback again and try more of the menu options. After dinner we went to the bar and the bartenders were super friendly and knew their licors as they suggested a few things for me to try . Great restaurant overall that I would definitely recommend in the future"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all by The Black Pig. My husband and I went there on a Thursday night around 7pm because Cleveland Scene rated it one of the top patios in the city. I definitely wouldn't agree with that, as it was just a cement rooftop patio with no real view of the city at all because of the surrounding buildings.  My husband ordered the pork tenderloin, which was delicious and very tender. It came with white beans, peas, and carrots. While the tenderloin was delicious, the side dish was bland. I ordered the steak frites. The steak was bland and the fries were literally just a giant pile of your everyday fries. It came with garlic butter and blue cheese butter, but even those were bland and I love cheese and butter! Definitely not worth $21.   The service was incredibly slow, so I fully expected the restaurant to be packed inside when we left. It was empty. The patio was full, but even then there were only eight tables, most of which only had just two guests. The only saving grace of this place was that my husband really enjoyed the Manhattan the bartender mixed for him. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I got the banh mi sandwich and it was delicious! The service was great and I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"They were out of the pork belly I wanted, so I got the pasta tasting menu.  Very small portions, but only $30 for 3 courses.  First was a bright, tart bow-tie style pasta, which was a little underwhelming.  Nice, but not spectacular.  Second was the star - a cheese-filled squid ink ravioli which was worth the entire $30.  Only 6 small pieces to an order, but the tastiest thing I've had in a while.  Last was a nice braised lamb Bolognese pappardelle.  A little strong on the lemon zest and the lamb was slightly dry, but very good flavor."}
{"text":"This place.....  So terribly disappointing, I don't even like to talk about it, so I will keep it short. I came here for my boyfriends birthday which a group of close friends. I was so excited to sit down with my old friends and have a great meal, or so I thought.  Service was beyond poor- we were not treated properly in any way,  the food was cold and tasteless. Cold, limp pork??? No thank you.   Mid meal, the hostess actually tried to come take one of our tables away to pack us in like sardines to fit more people (we made a reservation for the correct amount of people in our party)   I could totally justify giving somewhere another shot regardless of the fact that I had horrible service the first time around, but the fact that that the food couldn't even come close to compensating for that sealed the deal entirely.   If you are thinking of trying this place, think again. There are plenty of other options in ohio city. I wish I could give it no stars. Just no."}
{"text":"So, the new location (in my opinion) allowed The Black Pig to do a complete 180. Not only is the feel of the new space more cozy & intimate, everything compared to the last one was 100% improved upon.  I vowed to NEVER return to The Black Pig again. In fact, myself and about 10 others that I dined with made it a point to spread the word about how horrible our experience was (rude service, cold/ horrible food, etc.) But 2 years later, I decided to give the new location another shot and I am glad we did.  Our server was one of the best. She was attentive, very conscious of a dietary restriction, and super pleasant. The beer selection was great, food was amazing. I had the short rib (very tender & flavorful.) I love that the options are unique compared to other restaurants in the area while remaining class at the same time. If that makes any sense?   Overall, a satisfying experience and I can no longer say I am a Black Pig hater. My friends will be shocked, but they will just have to try the new joint and find out for themselves :)"}
{"text":"Ok. We have nothing to say but fantastic. Don't read reviews until you have experienced it for yourself. Wait staff, food, portions were all top notch.  Be sure to venture out a bit. I love chicken livers and ordered some for the table. Friends that normally would turn their nose, just loved them. Pork collar, pork rinds all exceptional. Good value and will return for sure."}
{"text":"The first time we visited The Black Pig my husband and I had a wonderful experience. The drinks and food were so delicious and decently priced. We returned for our second time last night and the experience was still nice, but about 40 min after we left my husband got extremely sick. I called the restaurant this morning to notify the owner about my husbands sickness and to suggest they check their other pieces of Salmon in hopes others wouldn't get sick. The owner just told me it takes about 24hours for a food borne illness to occur, and he hopes my husband feels better. We then spoke to our Doctor, who said scombroid poisoning is something that can be caused by fish that has not been refrigerated properly and symptoms of scombroid poisoning will usually develop 20 to 30 minutes after you eat the affected fish. I was very disappointed that the owner didn't try to make It right. There was no apology, & no offer of compensation for his meal. We are very disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're craving chicken livers and Mcdonalds chicken nuggets at the same time, go to Black Pig."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the hostess was so pleasant when we went for brunch , can't wait to go back! Atmosphere is also super cool!"}
{"text":"great service  freshest of foods  sneaky best pickles  awesome location  excellent staff  will be going again soon."}
{"text":"As my go-to brunch spot, this is a fan-favorite amongst my friends who are willing to accompany me on a hungover Saturday or Sunday afternoon. I always feel greeted and welcomed by the staff, and get frequent Instagram reposts from their account as I document my solo journeys to the bar for a pitcher of mimosa and the best dish that I have have ever had- the Short Rib Hash. I capitalized it, as it's that important. It seems to have a slightly different flare every time I get it, but always somehow better than the week prior. Get a side cup of Sriracha to spice things up and the game will be changed.   The prices are a little steep, but you definitely get what you pay for. The atmosphere is great, very clean with exposed brick all around and an excellent playlist in the background fitting to the aesthetics. Being on the outskirts of Ohio City, sitting outside on a warmer afternoon is also very peaceful in this area, a few dog-walkers and passer-bys, but not too crowded to distract you from your Short Rib Hash feasting."}
{"text":"Both times i have come i have never experienced more flavor before in a dish(short rib hash). It was insane. It would be 5 star if the service was better. The second time it took 40 plus minutes for our food to come out and our server never came over until the food came  which left me drink less until i got food and left us confused. I've also tried the burger which was mouth watering. I can't wait to try dinner here. I've been to many restaurants and i have never been somewhere that exudes flavor like this place. It's mouth watering."}
{"text":"Tonight the lovely assistant and I went to The Black Pig for dinner.  It was our first time visiting and most things were really great about this place.    I'll start by saying that I don't quite see how the name of the place fits with the interior.   Don't get me wrong, we loved the interior, it was warm and intimate, very clean, but to me, with a name like \"The Black Pig\" I imagine some low-ceilinged pub.    We didn't have a reservation, but we came early enough that getting a table was no trouble.  Were sat right away.    I'll take this opportunity to say that every single employee we saw was very, very friendly and accommodating.    Our server was no different.  She was outgoing and informative, bubbly would be a good word for her.  She kept our table clear and our drinks full with a big smile and a fantastic attitude.  I didn't get her name, but I enjoyed her service.    They had a mussels appetizer special that we ordered.  I'm not really a fan of mussels, but the girl is; so, why not?  She loved them.  Honestly, they were very fresh and delicately prepared.  The sauce they came in was a little too- \"wine-y\" for my taste.  But for the price, we got a lot of mussels.    For our entrees the girl got the seared scallops and I got the steak frites.  The scallops were served on a bed of black-truffle risotto with roasted mushrooms.  They were perfectly cooked, but we both agreed the dish felt too heavy and wished they were served on some sort of micro-green salad; or something...   My steak frites were cooked to the perfect shade of reddish-pink, but sadly, the meat was not hot...  in fact, it was on the cold side of warm.  It had a good taste and the blue cheese butter with it was nice, too.  I really didn't feel like sending anything back tonight.  The fries were great.  Ketchup in one ramekin and garlic aioli in the other. The portion was large and left nothing wanting (other than hot protein).    We split a bread pudding dessert that was topped with house-made marshmallows and  rested on a bed of some sort of chocolate.  It was nice, but a little small to justify the 8 bucks they're asking for it.    I liked The Black Pig and I don't see any reason why I wouldn't go back.  The staff especially make the visit very enjoyable, even if a few aspects of the meal weren't top notch.   I feel like I want to give The Pig 3.75 stars, but hey, Yelp is rounding you up to four.    We'll see you again!"}
{"text":"STRAWBERRY glazed pork belly with beet turnip and faro...  Let us pause to ponder the greatness of this dish...uh wait can I have more...I forgot to take a foodporn pic!  Wonderfull place on a Friday night to sit outside enjoying wine, great company, good food, lovely atmosphere...and the pleasant, wonderful service from our waiter (the cuteness with the man bun didn't hurt) was just what my body ordered.  Ordered the small order of ricotta almond agnolotti which was perfect portion and oh so delish!"}
{"text":"Having gone through my ups and downs with The Black Pig when they were at their old location on West 25th Street I have to admit that I was reticent to pay them a visit in their new digs (the former Light Street Bistro). My last experience at the old Black Pig was, to put it mildly, a disheartening disappointment. Below average on all counts. Well, I guess I finally managed to get over the sting because I recently found myself, once again, wandering under the Black Pig signage.  Have you ever had a dining experience where everything went so well that you expected to be shat on by a bird upon exiting? I'm talking about something that hardly every happens, something so rare that you can only be snapped back into reality by an action of equal and opposite quality? That's what happened to me when I was here with my wife on a recent Saturday evening. Sometime around 6pm, if memory serves.  I can't be sure, but the innards of the restaurant appear to have remain relatively unchanged since it sailed under the Light Bistro flag. This isn't a bad thing, as I rather like the dark woods and brick thing going on, just an observation. If it ain't broke, right? We were shown to a seat in the main dining area by the windows up front. I love it when I get a seat with such awesome natural lighting. So good for Yelpie picture taking. Another bonus, the place was just lightly populated and pretty quite. Two more gold stars.  Our server, where to begin. Lenore was a delight. Pleasant, friendly, knowledgeable, charming. And I'm not talking about all of those things being painted in your typical \"I'm a server so I'm trained to act this way\", she seemed pretty damn genuine to me. I almost wanted to invite her to have a seat with us. Let's just say that she is an asset to the establishment and a role model for all looking to make a career of hospitality.  The menu is an exercise in culinary brevity and it's filled with dishes that you'll want to eat. Everything is made in house, and I mean everything. All of the food that we were served was beautiful, clearly plated with love and an eye for composition. I'm not one to wax poetic over how my food's arranged on my plate, but damn. Zacharian would be proud. As for the potent potables, let's just say they're made with the same attention to detail as the edibles. The beer list, as concise as the menu itself and unfortunately lacking a draught offering, still managed to keep the beer geek in me happy with a 21st Amendment Hop Crisis DIPA and Dogfish Head Festina Peche.  We started our dining experience with an order of bread paired with the house cheese plate. Holy soft, glutenous, seedy warm, smear some butter on me goodness. This bread was so fresh I thought I'd be forced to backhand it. The cheese plate was a bit like eating our way around an artist's palette. Crispy baguette and flat bread, a dollop of honey, sweet candied nuts, cranberry mostarda, and bits of cheese ranging from uber funky blue to slightly sweet and nutty gruyere.   My wife thoroughly enjoyed her order of wild mushroom agnolotti. Folded and crimped house-made pasta pillows filled with earthy wild mushroom puree served with sauteed chanterelle and straw mushrooms, ridiculously fresh English peas and a sprinkling of fresh Pecorino Remano cheese. And butter. My god, the butter.  But the star of the evening, no question, was the short rib entree. This was a dish so good I starting dreaming about it while I was eating it. A dish so good that it has food all across the greater Cleveland area and as far north as Toronto rethinking its very purpose. When there's something this good, why even bother trying? But it's only short ribs, what's the big deal?  Two baseball-sized blocks of short rib cooked perfectly. Wait, perfectly doesn't do them justice. This meat was cooked like I'd imagine how Odin would cook meat. It was so tender that it laughed at me when I picked up my knife. Perfectly caramelized and glazed in a sauce with a flavor so deep James Cameron wants to dive it. Sure, the asparagus was nice - fork tender and slightly charred - and the roasted fingerling potatoes were just crispy enough and the pea puree as smooth as a Luther Vandross ballad, but the meat. If cows knew about this meat they'd want to eat it. Get the short ribs and you'll know what it must have been like for Jules when he opened Marcellus' briefcase.  There's really not much more that needs to be said here. If you need me I'll be over here basking in the after glow."}
{"text":"Ready for a round two review? I recently paid the Black Pig another visit and I'm afraid this one's the victim of a sophomore slump. Slow service, average food and a wobbly table.   In what would mark my second visit to the Black Pig in about 6 months I returned as part of a group of six for one of those \"two people have birthdays that are sort of close together so let's celebrate them at the same time\" get togethers. Our reservations were at 1pm on a Saturday.  When we arrived the restaurant was practically empty. It was empty the last time we visited, too. Coincidence? Maybe they just don't draw a lunch crowd or maybe we just go out before it gets crazy. Whatever the case, we really didn't need the reservation. They sat us at a table against the wall back by the kitchen. Speaking of the kitchen, I still dig the fact that it's open into the dining area. I enjoy seeing the chefs hard at work and the hissing and clanging sounds.   I do like the ambiance of the space, hip and comfortable. Unfortunately, I was a bit turned off by the thick layer of dust covering the stairs of the spiral staircase that was next to our table. Another small gripe, our table, a 4-top, was wobbly. So much so that we actually had to ask our server to cram some napkins under the leg. C'mon, people, it's all about the details.  Our service was quite slow. The guy that was waiting on us seemed to be covering the entire dining room and the bar and appeared stretched a bit thin. Whatever the case, it was very...drawn...out. Part of this I can understand, we were a party of 6 and there are two guys working the kitchen. That makes for a bit of a labor crunch. But when I have to wait 15 minutes for a drink, not so much understanding.  The food on this trip just didn't seem to impress me that much. It seems unexciting, average, even boring. Just about everyone at the table, 4 out of the 6, ordered the Black Pig Burger. The overall consensus - not a bad burger, just not great. I guess now that charging $14 for a burger and fries has become accepted practice the standards have slipped a little. The fries that came with the burger also seems a bit on the greasy side (too many crammed in the fryer at once?).  We also ordered the braised pork belly appetizer. We had this the last time we were there and liked it much less this time. The belly itself was cooked well, tender pork, melty fat, but the recipe has been changed. Now, the celery root puree was much thicker (last time it was more of a sauce with nuts in it) and there were pieces of diced sweet potato? The online menu says peaches and fennel and I don't remember what it said on the menu that afternoon. The  bottom line, it just wasn't as good.  I wasn't terribly hungry and good thing, because the portions that I had were definitely on the small side. I went with the simple salad followed by the braised rabbit appetizer.  Simple Salad ($6) - What a disappointment. A small pile of various greens practically undressed, with slices of purple radish. One of the worst salads I've ever had. I should have saved myself the money and just chewed on some grass outside.  Braised Rabbit ($12) - A tiny cast iron pot, about a cup, composed of barley, golden raisins, walnut oil and rabbit. The flavor was pretty good but there was barely any rabbit (could have been chicken for all I know) and I found the sweetness of the raisins a bit overpowering. This was basically barley and raisins, and about $3 a spoonful.   I don't normally downgrade places that I've reviewed in the past but I think it's warranted in this case. We had such a nice experience during our first visit that I thought for sure it would make for a solid return trip. Not so. With so many options it's hard to think of a reason to come back."}
{"text":"This is the same great food with the same melt-in-your-mouth braised pork belly, that ended up in my belly, and with the same degree of satisfaction as before. This is just a block away or two maybe from the previous location, except the place is just bigger and better with twice the fun. We had the bahn mi, braised short rib and the burger -- all very worth the visit."}
{"text":"They had us at the pork belly... melt-in-your mouth tender, well-rendered fat, tasty, and seasoned in a way that didn't make it taste too \"porky\". The duck confit appetizer was equally impressive, and much like the pork belly, fat was rendered excellently, skin crispy, and the meat fell right off the bone. The trout fulfilled my requirements of the dish: the skin had a good pan-sear, yet was juicy but not soggy on the inside. It was served hot on top of grits and kale. These dishes get a 5.  The croque madam was warm, comforting and oh boy, larger-than-expected. It would taste like a ham and cheese sandwich with egg on top. The bread tasted like a sourdough that tasted even better when that sunny-side-up egg broke all over it. This is an easy dish I can make at home though. Pork schnitzel was a decent dish, basically your German version of an American breaded pork chop or Japanese pork Tonkatsu if you will. There was an egg on top that took it to a higher level. It was well cooked, but I personally think it's challenging to get more \"wow\" out of a breaded pork cutlet, not much to say. These dishes get a 4.  Our waitress Kara was friendly and positive, I mean, naturally and effortlessly positive. You rarely see that anymore. She seemed like the kind of person who would volunteer to help an animal shelter. We loved her.  There's car valet service nearby, otherwise, you might have to park at the westside market parking lot. For 6 bucks, the decision was easy.  Overall it's a 4.5, but I'll round to 5, a new favorite for me.  To think that Ohio city was nearly dead 10 years ago, we love the revival, and the new energetic vibe. The repurposed building in which it was situated was a hip backdrop. I felt like a cool kid in there..."}
{"text":"They keep getting better!  We are fans of the black pig, and have frequented many times. We believe they've gotten better since they moved to their larger location on Bridge Avenue. My wife and I shared two appetizers and two entrées: the roasted carrots and the mushrooms with poached egg were the appetizers, while the Roast Salmon and the New Creation Pork chop finished the meal. All four plates were beautifully presented and perfectly finished with just the right seasonings for a lovely summer evening dinner.   Our server, Joe, was quite knowledgeable about both beer and wine and helped us make appropriate selections to perfectly complement the meals as well.   On balance, we both agreed that of our many visits to The Black Pig, this was the best meal we've ever had."}
{"text":"An exceptional meal in a neat old building with a great atmosphere and excellent service. Better than Lola's and Greenhouse Tavern.  We had the charcuterie platter, which was divine. Then the incredible beet salad- wish it had been larger, but enjoyed every bite. Tortellini filled with mortadella was really good, but too similar to the flavors of the charcuterie plate- wish I'd tried the mushroom pasta instead. Also the peas were really starchy. The pork chop was divine- a huge hunk of scrumptious meat cooked to perfection and served with a perfect slaw. Wish we'd had time to try the chocolate pot de creme, but we'll be back. My husband was also impressed with the beer list. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I was definitely impressed. To start, it's in a great location and is easy on the eyes. Cocktail list covers all bases and an impressive beer and wine selection. But let's get to the food....  The restaurant has a sort of pig theme. The menu is short and sweet. It is rotating and starts with a couple charcuterie options, next are small plates and mains. What makes this place unique are the next two sections. There is a 3-choice fix prix menu and a pork specials section that includes both starters and a main course.  We split the charcuterie which was great. I personally had a mushroom pasta and the asparagus, both were excellent. The pork specials main course was ordered to my table as well as the fish main. Everyone was extremely satisfied.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best. Bacon. Ever.  I took my parents here for brunch on Mother's Day and it was great. The highlights for us were the pork belly and egg, the sticky pig cocktail.. and the bruleed bacon. Of course you would expect a place called the Black Pig to serve delicious pork dishes, but this bacon was beyond my expectations! It was charred and smokey and fatty.. total perfection. My mom and I agreed that we would've been satisfied with just the bacon and more sticky pig cocktails. Yum!  Also worth mentioning was the croque madame - it was delicious and overstuffed with delicious ham. It was a little heavy and large for brunch for me, but if you're in the mood for something really substantial, it's a good bet. We also tried the financier dessert which was delicious as well. I will definitely be back to the Black Pig and am excited to try their happy hour and dinner!"}
{"text":"Tried The Black Pig for the first time last night and we will definitely be going back.   Started with the chicken liver appetizer on the waitress's recommendation and was not disappointed.  The taste is pretty mild - wasn't sure what to expect as I'm not a big liver eater. If you truly don't like liver you might not enjoy these - otherwise if these are available, I definitely recommend trying.   Had the pork collar as an entree and my girlfriend had the pork chop (they specialize in weekly pork offerings). Pork collar was very rich and melted off the bone like short ribs, it was excellent. Tried the pork chop as well and I can safely say it was the best pork chop I've ever had.   Drinks were well made too."}
{"text":"This place is a bit off the beaten track but not a let down. The staff is friendly and the food is great! It's a quiet place great for brunch, cocktails or dinner. It's not loud or crazy trendy but very low key and easy.  I ordered the pork chop off the Daily Pig menu, that changes often and it was huge and perfectly cooked! The drinks were also really tasty and well made. I would absolutely go back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The purée tasted like vomit, how old was that broccoli rabe dude? The luke warm meat felt like trying to cut through a dead fish with a butter knife. Doesn't help that the waitress was a wet blanket. Biggest waste of money in 2013. Don't even bother."}
{"text":"Umm, yes please and thank you.   Perfect cocktails and a mini drink menu with specials that are on the cheap (only $5.) And the wine I had did NOT taste like $5--even my friend said she would have paid double for a wine that delicious.   The food? If you like me then you should throw a scallop at me--directly in my face, that is. The Black Pig does scallops well. Simply seared with delicious potato puree. And let me tell you, these are quality scallops. We also ordered a cheese board which was also perfection. I'm not a blue cheese person, but the other two selections were spot on. My friend ordered the vegetarian entree with mushrooms, lentils, roasted tomatoes, creme fraiche and puff pastry. The flavors were rich, sophisticated, and you didn't miss the meat.   The service is also spot on and I saw a few dishes fly past my face that I wish I also ordered. Hello, Croque Madam...  We sat on their back patio, which would have been nicer if there wasn't a mysterious sprinkling of water that kept splattering everyone. I'm thinking a rooftop AC unit from the building next door? But the space itself is awesome and it's cool to be up high!   Can't wait to come back and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give these guys 5 stars, is because their kitchen is always closed when I go there. I love their food. It's great. It's different and really high quality. But, they need to have their kitchen open during all business hours."}
{"text":"My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary in Cleveland.   The Black Pig came recommended by a friend of ours.  We were very excited to try this place because of what our friend had said about it.  Unfortunately we were sadly disappointed.     We ordered the cheese and meat board that many reviewers raved about.  It may have just been our tastes but the pickles were the best thing on the plate.  On to our entrees.   I ordered the chicken. It wasnt bad but I can make better at home.  The potatoes and beets that come with it were tasteless.  Hubby ordered the short ribs on the recommendation from our server.  They were tender and flavorful but were lacking something.  Maybe a little salt.  After our disappointing meal we did stay for dessert.  That was probably the highlight of the entire experience.  They only offered three desserts so we shared the chocolate truffles.  They were very rich but still yummy when you mixed the dark chocolate truffle with the white chocolate truffle mousse and some of the caramel.     Our server was attentive but overall service was very slow.   Needless to say this was our first and last trip to the Black Pig."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing dining experiences ever. Everything about their service and menu was perfection. The crispy potato fingerlings are to die for."}
{"text":"The food here is really outstanding.  The best I have ever had in Cleveland.  Even better than l'albatross. The only downside is the location.  It is right across the street from a huge low income housing apartment complex.  Because of that there are always shady and ghetto people around."}
{"text":"The Event Booze and Burlesque is what we were hired for, From the entry to the restaurant the atmosphere was just right with all the staff, The drinks were phenomenal the show girl was particularly our favorite. They were tasty but strong and we are not complaining about that for sure!.. The food taco wise was heaven the pork belly was delish and we would have just eaten all the tacos if we could have but we had work to do... We really liked that place and will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing Friday dinner! We got 2 appetizers, the rabbit and the duck (which were both something fancier than just that but forgot names), both were small - enough for 1 person, but flavor perfection! They hired some skilled chefs! We also ordered the beet salad and the pork tenderloin, also amazing! Don't live in the area but if we come back through we would def stop again."}
{"text":"The Black Pig makes me reconsider every other 5-star review I've given on Yelp. It's that good.   Ordered the 3-course tasting menu--your whole bill is 20% at the bar during happy hour--and it was worth. every. penny.  The service was a little slow between the first and second courses, and I would agree with some of the other reviewers that said they seemed a bit apathetic, but it was not enough to deter me from undoubtedly giving this place 5 stars. They did apologize for the wait, but more importantly, the food is to die for.  I got the poached apple fennel salad, which was incredible!! @The Black Pig, feel free to message me your apple poaching technique at any time. The main course was braised short ribs, the portion was large enough that I took half home. They had some sunchokes served with it that were so perfect. I didn't know a person could love sunchokes so much. My only complaint was I wanted more sunchokes. Then onto dessert--apple cider pannacotta with cinnamon biscotti. My friend said \"Wow, this is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth,\" and I would agree.   Will 100% be returning to The Black Pig if for nothing else than to beg for some recipes."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK. I recently went for my second time, and my feelings haven't changed much.   First time around, I got the Croque Madame which I wasn't impressed with. The bread was too hard and chewy. Second time around I ordered the Banh Mi and was very happy with it- I'd probably stick to that if I came back again for a meal.  The side of mushrooms was delicious too.  The pork schnitzel I tried second time around was also pretty good, but honestly a very small dish for the price and the place, I wouldn't recommend it.  On my second trip we were a group of 10 celebrating a birthday, and I will say this is a great place for that.  The hostess and waitresses handled the group really well, there was enough variety on the menu for everyone, and then we were at a great location to move on to the bars afterwards.  Two thumbs up for a great birthday dinner spot- which are often hard to come by.  As for the set up, it still looks the same as Dragonfly, but with a painting of a pig stuck on one wall, not that I care much about that.  I've checked out the rooftop and while it does have a nice view of the city (or the projects, depending on which way you face), their table choices were odd and made the space a bit of a waste.  They'd be better off if they put a small bar up there so more people can enjoy the air, rather than a few tables for diners. Also, at this point, there are no heat lamps so don't expect to make use of this space for more than 2 months of the year.."}
{"text":"We went for Saturday brunch and will most definitely be back! Started off with a pitcher of mimosas (so delicious and a generous portion), followed by caviar and eggs, brûléed bacon, and short rib hash. My husband claimed the short rib hash tasted great, but could have a little less potatoes and a little more short rib. Overall the food was great, the atmosphere was cozy, and played great music. Only downside was slow service, but who cares when you have a pitcher of mimosas in front of you"}
{"text":"We went for brunch while in town. The food and service is great. The coffee is delicious as well."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with The Black Pig. I planned a celebratory dinner for 14 of my lovely friends, and the management did a perfect job accommodating all of my requests. They were able to give us the entire upstairs so our evening was private and extra special. At my request they had two sparking wine bottles ready for us when we got there. Our server was very friendly and helpful. They have a good selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. One of my buddies didn't get his drink for a long time, and our server apologized profusely and his drink was on the house. Totally unnecessary but very appreciated. My only complaint of the night was that our entrees took a super long time to arrive, but with 14 people this is understandable. And the chef made sure each entree was cooked perfectly and brought out at the same time. For this, all is forgiven!   The food was absolutely delicious. Everyone was happy with their meals. The Berkshire pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth delectable. I love everything pork belly (if you read my reviews, then you know), and this appetizer was quite possibly the best bit of piggy belly I've ever put in my mouth. The garnish of nuts was just a wow addition. For the main course, I ordered the Berkshire pork (an ode to pork, if you will), which consisted of different forms of pig: sausage, moar pork belly, tenderloin, a hot dog (yes, and it was so good) and another type of pork preparation that I simply can't remember because I was in nirvana while eating this dish. Everything. Was. Divine. The dish was seasoned perfectly and the meats sat on a lovely bed of mashed potatoes. My favorite was definitely the pork tenderloin. This was a big boy-sized entree and the leftovers tasted equally great the next day. My boo ordered a fresh pasta dish cooked in a nutty sauce that was also delicious, but pork all the way baby.   Overall, thank you, The Black Pig, for a great night! We left with our bellies full and satisfied. I can't wait to come back to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. The Brie omelette and Bloody Mary for brunch are to die for. The Ohio roasted carrots, pork meatballs and burger for dinner were also spectacular. Their food is very high quality- I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Three men ambling throughout W 25th street sick and tired of the shoulder to shoulder bar scene that they had so grown accustomed to, were open to adventure. Shadows of run of the mill centers of libation littered the streets, when a flicker of light caught their eye at the Black Pig. Daydreams of bacon wrapped beers flashed through their minds. Although hesitant to dive into an uncharted territory such as the \"dark swine,\" they chimed in unison, \"YOLO\". Upon entering the premises, aromas of grilled muenster and unique India pale ales consumed their nostrils. \"Why not here, Why not now?\" they asked. Was this to be their \"spot?\" Walking in, the three wanderers viewed a concave bar with an open concept floor plan, crafty musings on the walls, and decently attractive waitresses adorned with provocative tattoos. This is where the experience took a turn for the worse. Being that it was a bar, the tallest member of the three man wolf pack decided to buy around. A fan craft beers himself - he knew exactly wanted: founders all day IPA. Not only was this choice beer not available on draft, warm cans were the only option. Not only that, but upon ordering, the \"British\" bartender, whom we'll call \"Sir Walter Peckersmith,\" demanded to see all three of the middle aged patrons' ID's (and one passport). Dumbstruck by the inconvenience of removing their identification cards from the bowels of their coats, the three amigos were tremendously taken aback. Sir Walter Peckersmith rudely heckled the patrons about their national origins, proclaiming Great Britain and their red coats to be superior. In awe of the disrespect the foreigner whom resides within this beautiful country many call \"The United States of America,\" the three men decided to close the tab after one round of beers. The only rationale the three men could amass for the bartender's behavior must have been the beating his country took in the revolutionary war as well as the second blow in the War of 1812. The general condescending tone Sir Walter Peckersmith decided to employ made this throne that belongs to swine a failure in the minds of the three. Vowing never to return to the dungeon that is the Black Swine, the three downed their beers like true gentlemen; more gentlemanly than Sir Walter Peckersmith himself."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. Mimosas are great. Literally the food is on point. That being said, do not go to this place if you're in a hurry. It's good for a nice 2 hour brunch.   Adding an extra star because the bartenders are nice. Food is amazing. Get bacon.   Mic drop."}
{"text":"We had lunch there late on Sat afternoon.  We really liked the atmosphere there.  The bar was large & modern.  The kitchen was actually visible from the dining area but not so much that you could actually watch them prepare the food.  I ordered the vegetarian bahn mi & my husband got the burger.  I'd say our food was a solid 3/5 not bad, not spectacular.  There were no standout flavors to my sandwich.  It was basically grilled veggies on a bun.  I thought it would have more of an Asian flavoring to it & could have used a condiment of some sort so I was pretty disappointed. The burger was on the smaller side.  They both came with well seasoned fries.  I think the atmosphere was the star here.  I was also disappointed that they didn't have any fresh brewed teas. Service was mediocre.   If I lived in town I'd go back & try different menu items hoping they would be better than what we had because I really liked the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meh. Totally underwhelming. Was lured in by a modern sounding menu, but was disappointed by the food, music choices, and prices. I'd sooner go back to the sub-par Turkish place on 25th than return to this waste of money."}
{"text":"Sunday night is a great time for tacos and booze.  I promise.  I continue to love this spot; even more so now that they have Sunday night happy hour.  9pm and onward, this place gets a little Mexican.  They have a selection of 5 tacos (my favorite is the lamb tongue).  $5 per order gets you two solid soft tacos!!  You can also get chips and salsa or guacamole.  Thirsty? They got beer, wine, and whiskey specials.  They also got some damn good cocktail specials.  Swing on by the Pig Sunday night and jam out on the one night a week this place doesn't play homage to anything French!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We had great service and an absolutely fabulous meal! We got the brussel sprouts and the fingerling potatoes to start, both of which were delicious. For our entrées we got the fettuccine and the short ribs... The lamb in the fettuccine was wonderful and the short ribs melted in our mouths. Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Remember when you went to a restaurant, spent $50 on a dinner and left it so hungry that devoured  stale  potato chips in the car on the way home? I bet that was fun. That's exactly what happened to me at this very doubtful joint. Please do not get me wrong - I am very familiar with fancy meals and places, so familiar that fancy can be easily my middle name. But The Black Pig just did not measure up : it had the service of a regular Cleveland diner and prices of Meatpacking District.  My entree ( steak dinner and short rib) was a size of a fist and a price of an entire cow ( whooping $22!!).  It did taste good though, all 3 bites of it. I immediately felt like a Gulliver when tried to pick up a fancy potato crisp that was artistically thrown on a my 2 oz slice of a steak. Orphans during Second World War had bigger portions, I swear. Utterly confused by the sight of our entrees ( my friend had exactly 3 tiny bites of a duck), we had nothing to do but to have some wine and good thoughts for dinner being offered no bread or any additional sides. The waitress somehow managed to lose her interest in us ridiculously fast and when I asked her to come back with a dessert menu, she showed back up without such but with the checks. That was ok though - I already pictured how I would have been offered half of a fancy donut or chocolate chip cookie crumbles for additional $10. Again I am happy to reassure you - we are not some  hungry barbarians without class who wanted super-sized burgers. We were willing to pay extra to experience better things - being hungry is just not one of them.  And are you about to tell me that we got ripped off like this because of the patio with a spectacular view?  I can tell you that next time I would like to see Cleveland skyline with its one skyscraper and red glowing Key Bank sign, I am jumping on the roof next to the Black Pig patio where some dishwashers from the restaurant near by were eating french fries and enjoying the view - completely free of charge. And something tells me that they left their roof  more satisfied and happy than we did. My advise to you - eat before you go there, bring tons of cash, patience ( meals take forever) and a date with a history of gastric bypass suregry."}
{"text":"We recently tried Black Pig in its new location on Bridge St. and were really pleased. (We'd had a couple so-so meals when it was on W 25th.) we ordered delicious craft cocktails at the bar and split small plates and an entree. The short ribs, Brussels sprouts, beet salad and chicken livers were all amazing. We love the setting with the exposed brick too. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This was the first time at The Black Pig. There were three of us on a girl's night out. We arrived about an hour early for our reservation since we were in the area, so sat at the bar and had drinks and an appetizer. The bartenders were very friendly and helpful. One friend got a Blackberry mojito, which was delicious. The other had wine and I got a virgin blackberry mojito which was really good and refreshing too. We got the cheese plate for an appetizer, which came with three cheeses, crusty bread, flatbread, and fruit. It was very good, and a pretty fair price of $10.   We were seated on time for our reservation. Our server was friendly and attentive. She gave us some recommendations after we asked. We ordered the Ohio beef, the pork tenderloin, and the duck breast. Each were flavorful and delicious with good accompaniments, although portions were fairly small. The Ohio beef was probably our favorite dish, but there could have definitely been more of it.   Overall the time to get our food was pretty long. We didn't notice as much since we were busy chatting, but it definitely wasn't quick.  It was also pretty loud in there, but not so much that we couldn't converse. It just isn't a quiet restaurant, so completely fine to bring a kid or two and not have to worry about keeping them quiet the whole time.   This restaurant reminded me somewhat of The Greenhouse Tavern, but not as good. Many of their plates had the same concept, but the Greenhouse Tavern elevates the flavors more, in my opinion, but the food is simpler at the same time. Nothing distracts from their plates, whereas I felt that some of The Black Pig's plates had some extra, unneeded distractions.   Anyway, overall I would recommend it if you're in the area, but really prefer The Greenhouse Tavern for similar menu/pricing and better food."}
{"text":"Wow! The Black Pig is in the trendy Ohio City area and the food was fantastic. We ordered the pork belly and the house made meat sampler. The chicken liver mouse, pork pate, and rabbit tourine were all wonderful! They were accompanied properly with condiments that had a purpose (pickled red onions, homemade grain mustard, etc). Highly recommend the meat sampler! For entrees, since we came for lunch, two of us ordered their house signature burger, which came with house cut fries. They burgers were good and flavorful, however, one was ordered medium rare and it came out well done, so that was a bummer and the cause to drop it a star.  The bahn mi sandwich was flavorful and just plain awesome. I got my fries with gruyere cheese and gravy on top and everyone else at the table was envious. I highly recommend getting your fries with the cheese and gravy. Yum. I'm craving them now! The pork schnitzel was crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  Our experience was fantastic. The service was top notch and next time I'm in Cleveland you best believe I'll be stopping at The Black Pig!"}
{"text":"We were left overs from being in town for the comedy club.  We were wandering around looking like dorks with our iphones in our hand using the yelp app and came across this restaurant.   It has a cool bar vibe while serving gourmet food.  I had the Ohio beef which was fantastic and my husband had the pan seared scallops.  They both were cooked to perfection.  I loved the added homemade chips! We will definately be back when we make another trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"All I have to say is \"delicious!\"  We went for brunch and it was probably the best I've had in Cleveland. Do let the odd menu items throw you off l, just order. I guarantee you will enjoy your choices. Make sure you start off with the charcuterie."}
{"text":"If you like pork, anything ordered from the \"Daily Pig\" section will make you very happy. I have always been delighted with the main dishes here. Like many others, though, our service is usually uneven. On our most recent visit it was 15 minutes before our waitress took our drink order (some confusion on which waitress had our table, I guess). The house cocktails work hard to integrate the most fashionable ingredients, but in the process ignore whether the final product is any good. The result is that the cocktails range from mediocre to awful. Stick to beer and wine.  I'll eventually be back because the main dishes are always great, but I'll be bracing for having to wait a long time for bad drinks."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for brunch sat on the patio. Our server Kara was very nice, knowledgable, and helpful. She suggested the Flour Sour and the Brown derby as drinks both were very good on such a hot steamy day. We ordered the Sticky Pigs bourbon drink which used to be on their menu but we asked if they could make it for us because it was so good when we had it for dinner. We both liked several things on the menu she ordered the Benedict , I ordered the short rib hash and the Bahn Mi. The fries that came with the Bahn Mi were fantastic the Bahn Mi itself was good not great the pork was overly dry but the flavors were nice. The Benedict with the pate and poached egg was delicious but my favorite was the short rib hash. The short rib was tender and the egg yolk mixed in with the whole dish was amazing. We kept sharing the Benedict and the Hash but we both agreed the hash was our favorite. I love Black Pig the service, food, and ambiance are great. I strongly recommend this place and believe it currents serves the most consistently amazing food in Cleveland. I would go back in a heart beat!! Great food and an amazingly beautiful girl with me what can be better."}
{"text":"I've been here a fee times and it's probably my favorite spot to get food in Ohio city. Crop bistro is better, but pricey enough to be reserved for more special occasions.   I normally don't do aside dishes, but the sauteed mushrooms here are phenomenal. Do get them. The croque madam sandwich is awesome and huge, you can never go wrong putting an over easy egg on a sandwich in my book. The braised short ribs are tender and oh so tasty. The presentation here is probably the best I've ever seen for a restaurant that will feed you for under $20.   That said, there are a few warts. I was unimpressed with the pork tenderloin dish I had last time, and it seems like the more expensive the dish, the less food that it comes with. The sandwiches are huge servings, the braised ribs just right, and the duck and pork tenderloins required me to order a side dish or go hungry.   Overall, great place to get a bite in Ohio city"}
{"text":"Parents treated me here for my birthday, so I splurged a bit and started the meal with the Sticky Pig. Tasty and always happy to try a new cocktail, especially one with ginger beer, but not good enough to tempt me away from my dark and stormy.   For appetizers, we tried the beet salad and the pork belly. The pork belly was definitely as tasty as promised and the beet salad was a nice pairing. 10/10, would pair again!   For my entree, I had the foie sausage. Very good! But the lentils and squash it came with were kind of meh. I would have MUCH rather had the pumpkin broth that came with my mom's pork cutlets. Dad had the special, the pork shank, and it really was fall off the bone tender! We took home leftovers and considered using the bone for soup--that good!   Overall, I had a great evening but wasn't wowed partially because of the food pairings. That said, I plan to come back and try the bahn mi and the happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"While the place was empty and I'm rarely impressed, I had the best burger I've had in years.  Caesar salad I didn't get however shrimp toast it came with was really great."}
{"text":"Back in its old location, I would have given this place three stars. The new location and what I believe is a new menu has really upped the ante. We went as a large group, got apps, drinks and entrees and loved everything. I don't think there was one \"bad order.\" The new location has a better ambiance and there is a nice bar as well where you can grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! Please go for a visit, the Food and beverages are all outstanding.  Chicken liver, Ohio carrots, Pork shoulder, Pork belly, oh the fingerling potatoes!!!!!  Desserts just WOW! Thank you for a lovely date night with my hubby. Staff were all pleasant and quite happy to offer opinions when we couldn't decide. Just lovely!"}
{"text":"Damn, dude. If you're a pork fiend, going to a place called \"The Black Pig\" does kinda sound like a no-brainer. The night before Thanksgiving, some family came in from out of town and made reservations at this place. They were a bit understaffed (probably due to the holiday), but the service was very nice and the food was unstoppable. Think of the finest version of bar food you can think of, elevated to the realm of punch-you-in-the-face good. When one of the best things I've eaten this year is a fancy pork version of Sloppy Joes, you know a place is doing something right. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. This was the second stop my husband and I did on Valentines Day for a drink and an app before Lolita happy hour. This may have been my favorite place and meal of the night, and it wasn't even very busy!  So we decided to try the braised pork belly. Mind you I have never tried pork belly. This was the best dish I have had in a very long time. It was so delicious I don't think I have the vocabulary to describe it. I almost fell off my chair when I took the first bite. It was served with a root vegetable purée and some walnuts. Everything complimented each other and it was like an orchestra of flavors. They did make a mistake and we waited 30- 40 min for it, but we were drinking and hanging out anyways so to be honest we didn't even notice.   So the next wonderful thing that happened was that they, by mistake, brought us a desert that belonged to another table but of course gave it to us anyways. I'm not even sure what it was called and I don't see it on the menu now so maybe it was a valentines day special but it was rich chocolate fudge rolled in cocoa powder and a chocolate macaroon and the kicker, a white truffle ice cream. Omg. This was such a decadent desert that I just about was done and wanted to go home before the Lolita happy hour.   I am already planning a day to come back here and eat dinner. I can't wait to see what else they have on the menu bc I would bet it is just delicious."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...like really really. My fiancé and I came here to celebrate his birthday and had been talking about the food and cocktails we wanted to order all week. Upon arrival, the main attitude and environment we experienced could only be summed up with one word: inconvenient. It felt as though our presence was an inconvenience to the staff, from ordering to trying to find a place to stand that wasn't in the way while we waited for our table. At one point a server bumped into me and offered a silent stare as I apologized...the \"thank you's\" were met with silence as food was brought to our table or plates were cleared. The food was lackluster, at best.   There were a few bright spots in a decidedly poor dining experience: our server noticed we hadn't eaten much of our appetizer and mumbled (literally it was almost impossible to hear what she was saying) something about \"see what I can do\" despite us not asking for anything, and when the bill came out the appetizer was not on it. Also, the man who was filling water and clearing tables was wonderful, pleasant, and kind.  Final thoughts: the food we ate was not nearly good enough for the cold and unwelcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant and bar nestled In the ohio city neighborhood on W 25th. The menu appears slightly limited but the meats were absolutely the most tender and delicious I've had while dining out In Cleveland. The Brisket and pork tenderloin just pulled apart effortlessly and melted in your mouth! Cocktails weren't too shabby either, I would definitely recommend for a fair price meat inspired dish and casual date night out!"}
{"text":"Portions were very small for the price. But the reasom this place gets a two has more to do with service. It took 45 minutes for a drink. Our server never checked on us after we got our food. Not somewhere I woulr ever go back or recommend."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, rounding up for the banh mi.  I was quite pleasantly surprised by the banh mi here!  It was a decently sized portion served with a nice pile of fries for $12.  The pork belly inside practically melted in your mouth and it tasted pretty darn similar to a good Vietnamese banh mi you might find in Los Angeles.  If I came here and only ordered the banh mi I might have given this place five stars.  On the other hand, I was quite disappointed by the Ohio Beef.  It was a 2x2x2 inch cube of short rib and a 2x2x2 inch cube of steak, paired with a few carrots for $22.  Not filling, and not much flavor either.  The pork belly appetizer was a good sized appetizer and delicious as well.  The apple bread pudding dessert was okay, but the texture was more reminiscent of french toast rather than bread pudding, and the tartness of the apple came through a little too much.  We had a reservation for 5:45 pm and we called around then saying we would be about ten minutes late.  The maitre d' told us that this \"might be a problem\" and went to talk to the manager.  They said it was fine in the end, but really?  I would give this place a shot - order the banh mi, and don't order the ohio beef.  And be on time, I guess."}
{"text":"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.   The Black Pig is, very simply, good. Their waitstaff was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food and beer lists. The cocktails arrived promptly to the table, and our server Siri was more than eager to please.   The Sticky Pig ($10) is a bourbon dream, with crushed peaches and mint melding with some strong alcohol. Their cider list was lacking (a bottle of Griffin for $11!), but the beer selection was acceptable.   I had the bahn mi ($12), a pretty close tribute to the Vietnamese sandwich. The pork belly was tender, and the pates were nice. Served with some nice, salty fries, it was a great meal. The veggie bahn mi, Black Pig burger, and kale Caesar salad received similarly pleasing reviews.   The Black Pig is good, but it could be better. The venue has wonderful character with brick archways and high ceilings, but it isn't being utilized. The food was lovely, but I'd love to see what they could do to make the Pig stand out from every other restaurant on W. 25th. I'll certainly be back to try it again."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday last Thursday and it was extremely delicious. We got in for Happy Hour and were able to get some drinks and snacks off the menu. We had the gravy fries and pork belly - both of which were delightful. The Sticky Pig, while strong, is probably my new favorite drink. I had the House Sausage, which was okay. When I return I will probably get something else. It had foie gras and I was not too crazy about that. Others at my table had the lamb and the Ohio beef steak, which were cooked to perfection. Dessert was also another treat! This is now on my list of top restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Is the food good?  It's very good.  Not \"zomg transcendent,\" but very, very good.  Um, why did you only give them one star?  It took more than an hour to get our appetizers.  The whole meal was two and a half hours.  For two courses.  It was insane.  And it was not crowded.  Anything else?  It took a hysterically long time to get our drinks.  Which was perplexing.  Our tab probably would have been more than double if we could have gotten drinks within 10-15 minutes of ordering them.  So just speed?  Tangentially, it was a bit crazy the server could not recommend a wine for us.  It's not a large wine list, and that is kind of the server's job (or to be able to grab someone who can help).  Might be cool to sit at the bar and order something, and maybe they're faster on the weekend, but you should avoid the regular seating during the week."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drinks, AMAZING happy hour. It's not light, but it also has \"pig\" in the name. Highlights: the Caesar salad, the banh mi, the schnitzel, the meat and cheese boards, the burger, the pork belly and the brunch. Their drinks are good too, just a little pricey."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience and meal at the black pig. Love the vibe, decor (open-brick walls, comfy and intimate booths), and friendly service. Food was also delicious and reasonably priced for the quality.   My party of 5 and I ordered:  Appetizers: - meat plate: my bf truly enjoyed this. It came with andouille sausage, pork pâté, and chicken liver mousse along with bread.  - mussels: if you've ever had pho, the sauce kind of tasted like that.   Entrees: - scallops: so, so good!! One member thought it was slightly salty, another thought it needed more salt, and I thought it was done perfectly.  - Ohio beef: the meat came out more in the rare side, so keep that in mind when you order - pork tenderloin: good, but not as good as... - roasted duck: obviously the plate I ordered, as it was my favorite. Everything about this dish was perfect. It actually alone warrants a very well-deserved 5 stars. It was so, so, so good and came with a side of confit, I believe.  - fries: with garlic aioli. Can't go wrong with a side of crispy fries to accompany your food!  Drinks: - magic lemonade: I didn't find anything too special in it. It kinda just reminds me of mikes hard lemonade :/ - sticky pig: it was too spicy for my taste. I ended up not finishing my drink and ordering a Coke instead. - the c...something (I forget): it was the drink with smoked coke in it. My bf called it a mans drink and announced that it tasted like drinking a cigar. He happens to enjoy cigars, so it's a compliment.   Over all, the food was great, and you really can't go wrong with any of the entrees I listed. I'd say my top two favorites were the roasted duck and scallops. I took off a star bc I wish their drink menu had something sweet and fruity for me, and I wasn't personally impressed with their appetizers or sides (even though the rest of my party loved the appetizers)."}
{"text":"The food here was great. I love pork and tried several of the dishes, this being my third visit now. The pork rinds were HUGE and tasted great. I will definitely return based on my experience with their food. Service was also good, no complaints.   I was disappointed in the outdoor seating, but I can't really fault the restaurant. My expectations were set by another reviewer who said the view of downtown was amazing. It is defiintely short of amazing, you are a little too low to see over several other buildings and power lines. It wasn't a bad set up, it just was not what I expected based on the other review.  I've tried several of their own mixed drinks and have always been pleased with them too."}
{"text":"Stopped here early on a Thursday night.  The place was quiet. Service was excellent. All the food was fabulous. The appetizer with chicken livers was amazingly good. The muscles came with a fabulous bread for dipping in the sauce. One in our party had swordfish for his entrée and said it was the best he'd ever had.  Another companion have the burger which was excellent. It is a beef burger, not pork. The french fries with the burger were sampled by all and were excellent. I had the mushroom ravioli which was wonderful. We all consumed every bite of our meals. The food descriptions seem adventurous to conservatives, but trust them, the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! However we felt overpriced for the amount you get. After ordering an appetizer and an entree per person we all left still feeling hungry. We went for dinner and sat out on the patio. The service was great, the server let us know when dishes were coming out and kept out drinks filled as we waited."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. This is a Cleveland gem. My husband and I came from out of town for dinner and were impressed. The food was fresh and favorable. You must get one of the pork dishes that they are known for(hence the black pig). We split the pork collar and it was one of the most tender pieces of meat I've ever tasted. We also had the scallops and a pear salad that was unique and equally tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and each time the service and food have been excellent. What prompted me to upgrade my original review, however, was the chef's menu. It's a bargain that's paced nicely and executed with care. I hope they can maintain their high level of quality."}
{"text":"So I was excited for them to move into their new space because I love the atmosphere. However, I think they increased their prices worth the new bigger space. And unfortunately, the quality of the food didn't match the price I paid for. The server was nice but we waited for almost 40 minutes for our food. I'll probably only come back for the cocktails and happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for brunch and both times the food is really great. My favorite meal is the eggs benedict, which actually has fried eggs instead of poached. They have a great deal for mimosas; $12 for a whole pitcher which probably has about 6 servings. My mom got the banana foster French toast and she loved that too. Overall, service is pretty good and the food is amazing (especially the crispy potatoes on the side). It's only one block away from the west side market and a nice place to walk around after brunch or dinner.   Food is a little on the pricier side for brunch, but I still found it to be really reasonable. It's definitely classier and better quality than cheaper diners. It's a great option if you're looking to have a little fancier brunch or celebrate with friends."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant. Everything is thoughtful here. The menu, food prep, portion size, decor and service are spot on.   I had the pork belly appetizer. It was fatty and delicious. I thought the dark fall flavors were good but I longed for a bright note to break up the fattiness.   The chicken entree was perfectly prepared.  Moist and well seasoned roast breast with potatoes and greens. I really was unhappy with how little greens were served. It was more like a garnish. Similarly, one of my dining companions was upset she didn't get much cabbage with her sausage dish. Cabbage and greens are cheap. The portions overall are very light so put a little more veg on the plate to balance the protein a little.   The table next to ours got bread and butter.  Were we supposed to ask?  Does everyone get bread service?  It looks good.   The almond financier with pineapple and coconut was great. This is a really nice desert.  Even though I have some complaints, I really like this place and would return to try something else."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service (because we had to wait well over 30 minutes past our reservation time, our group got a round at the bar on the house) and a really great atmosphere, but as a vegetarian, I'd come here for the drinks but find dinner elsewhere.   Ram Jam cocktail was excellent. The Chartreuse sizzler was also good. The vegans at the table enjoyed the Banh Mi sandwich that came with fries (which I stole from them) but I got the Mushroom Vol Au Vent (mushroom and tomato stuffed puff pastry with lentils on the sides) and while there wasn't anything bad about it, it wasn't as flavorful  or as memorable as I was expecting for the place and the price."}
{"text":"went with 3 friends on a tuesday night.......quite, open dining room with lots of old brick walls, banquettes and tables that all are in plain view of the open kitchen. atmosphere is very casual, laid back and unpretentious. the ginormous bar looked like a great place to hang out at and enjoy a snack or two.  the menu is very focused on pork, duh, it is the black PIG, but there are plenty of other choices too. we had , for appetizers, mussles, which melted in the mouth & were super tender. the braised rabbit with barley was SO FREAKIN' DELICIOUS!!! i could have made a meal out of this!!! and the french fries with gravy, which were just ok, i wasn't crazy about the taste of the gravy.. for dinner, everybody was delighted with their choices; a hamburger, schnitzel, sausage & barley and the tuesday special, pork shank with beans & brussle sprouts (this was my dinner). no knife needed here, the dinosaur sized pork shank was fall from the bone tender and the cassoulet of giant beans and sauteed brussle sprouts were a delicious compliment..... i wish that there had been a bit of  sauce ot jus to run the meat through. it was delicous, but needed that little extra. so full were we that we passed on dessert, as we ALL were taking food home! this is a good little restaurant, the only thing i wish they could expand their drink/cocktail list......none of us were really interested in any of the choices. nothing popped......and we're a cocktail group. i had a beer, one had wine, one water and the other a martini.  i'd surely go back again and recommend it friends and family."}
{"text":"Went last night and the place was dead. I split a charcuterie board with my sister and got the pear salad which was delicious. that and a glass of wine came out to be 28$.  My sister got a burger ordered medium well but was definitely medium rare, however she still ate it because it was that good. I heard a server telling the table they're trying to be more upscale than casual since they moved from 25th to bridge. I had never been to the old location so I'm not sure. The entrees looked amazing, however I don't eat pork so there were limited choices. I thought the food was a little pricey for the portion but overall it was good."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, sangria in a cozy space near west side market."}
{"text":"We have been here one time. We decided to try it based on reviews from friends.  We went in a Saturday for lunch. It was quiet, Perfect for the two of us. We chose the 5 course prix fixe menu.  The chef came out and asked about our food likes and dislikes.  The savory courses were excellent. Pork belly was amazing... Melts in your mouth. The braised rabbit was superb. It didn't taste gamey at all. The salad was crisp and refreshing.  Service was attentive.  We were disappointed with dessert though. The creme brûlée was very eggy and way too firm. The burned top was cold. It seems that it was have been left over and refrigerated  from the service the night before.   Overall great experience. We will be going back but we'll skip the creme brûlée!"}
{"text":"Brunch. Two people two dishes , one Bloody Mary, and two small coffees for $43.  Bloody Mary was mediocre at best and dishes were good. But French toast and eggs w French fries are not worth that much. Way overpriced for brunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, appropriate prices! No pictures since we ate the food, not ogled over it. Actually, I don't have the self control to take a picture before I dig in. The place was full of happy customers."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Cleveland for a Cavs game a couple of months ago and got together with a couple of friends who live in the area for brunch the next day. I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I was EXTREMELY ill from the night before (too much mixing of different alcohol - oops), which made the ridiculously long brunch even that much more miserable (we were there for 2.5 hours).  We arrived on time, and were seated right away. Two of us (including me) ordered the short rib hash, one ordered the free range toad in a hole and the other ordered a simple two eggs dish (with bacon, potatoes and toast). We also ordered a side of toast with truffle butter to share.   We patiently waited 30 minutes before I finally flagged down our waitress asking about our food, and again 15 minutes later. At around the one hour mark, the food finally started to come out, except they had messed something up on the toad in a hole dish and had to start over. We tried waiting for it but were told to just go ahead because our friend did not want all of our food to get cold.   Sadly, I could not eat a thing because I was so sick. Literally could not, even though I wanted to so badly. I managed to squeeze in THE TINIEST bite of the very yummy toast with truffle butter before I had to run into the bathroom. My fiance enjoyed his two eggs and bacon dish but said he didn't LOVE it, at least not for the price and the ridiculous long wait. His friend wolfed down his short rib hash in minutes, which meant that he thoroughly enjoyed it, though I suspect that it wasn't quite enough food for a big tall guy like him.  I can't remember how the toad in a hole dish was, or if our friend even got that. It's possible that she ordered something completely different after they had messed up her order, but I can't recall because I was too busy trying not to pass out from how sick I was feeling (cold sweat, extreme nausea, you name it). I got my entire dish wrapped up to go, and I'm so glad I did! I reheated it in the microwave the next morning and had it for breakfast - IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! I can only imagine how much better it would have been had I consumed it fresh out of the kitchen! Quite honestly, the entire brunch was such a disaster that the ONLY reason I am giving them a 3-star rating is purely for the amazingly tasty short rib hash."}
{"text":"The creativity of this menu is exciting. Their pork belly is fantastic and frankly I love the different twists I've seen on their dessert menu. Very creatively done. This restaurant has been very accommodating to my large reservations. Dark and hipster-themed but comfortable. Would definitely come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch which was delicious..would give it 4.5 if I could! Is much bigger than their old location. Food just as delicious and service just as good.  For drinks we got the mimosa pitcher and the coffee cocktail...would def get both again.  For meals we split a few but the banh mi and charcuterie board were my favorite. The pork belly on the banh mi was amazing. The charcuterie board is a great deal...good variety of meat for less than ten bucks. Would def recommend this place for either dinner or Sunday brunch...and they can accommodate large groups much easier now!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday last weekend. Lets just say that the company ended up being at least double what the reservations were, up on the beautiful patio on a Saturday night. Drinks and tequila were flowing, we ordered appetizers for three tables, and everyone got dinner, with stellar service.   I was drinking the magical lemonade, pretty sure it was lemonade and vodka but it was damn tasty. And perfect for sitting out on that patio. For the appetizers we had the poutine (a-ok), mussels, and pork belly (holy crap, I loved that pork belly). And then for dinner, I ordered the croque madame. Lets just say everyone was taking pictures of my food. It was huge, and delicious, and I couldn't finish so I shared it with my boyfriend and his brother. The steak frites were sold out but that would probably be my choice next time. I tried Fernando's burger, it was pretty hearty, and he's a burger aficionado. Also the fries were on point.   Basically, I want to hang out here all the time and try everything they have to offer."}
{"text":"Second time here and still impressed! Oh my oh my ... the Pork rinds are out of this world! They crunch and pop when you take a bite. Little bit of a wait time, a couple large parties ahead us. Burger was cooked to perfection, may be one of the best burgers in Cleveland! The fries today were a tad bit over done or old... not sure which one.. my guess old because we are eating at 9:30 at night ... either way, Highly recommend making this place one of your next stops!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place another try as I wasn't happy with my first meal a bahn mi sandwich. I will admit it was my first bahn mi so it might have simply been my tastebuds."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Came with a group of 5 around 6p with a reservation. Very nice atmosphere, great service, awesome food.  The charcuterie board was probably the most interesting I've had, with pate, duck confit salad, foie gras, salami and a couple more (obviously all delicious). Fried chicken livers were good, pretty much just tasted like fried chicken. I got the roasted pork collar and it was so soft and tender and juicy and flavorful mmmmmmm  Each of my friends got a different pork dish and they were all delicious as well, I especially like the short rib and pork chop.  The miso butterscotch pudding was very tasty too. There's only a slight hint of miso, I'm definitely not a fan of mixing sweet and salty but there's just barely a touch of the miso to cut through the sweetness. Very smooth and sweet and the crunchy granola on top gave it some texture.  Would come again"}
{"text":"Meh. Was I excited to try this place? Yes. Will I return? Meh.   I was so excited to try this place. I thought it was going to be a really cool local place that we would want to frequent often. However, I don't think we will ever return.   The cons: Well I don't like that I had to walk a good ways from West 25th. If you are out and about, the last thing you would want to do is walk a good ways to get something to eat or another drink.   Another con, the service. We sat at the bar and the two bartenders were too busy socializing with people that seemed to be regulars at this place. While that is all great and dandy, I think they should take care of all of their customers not just the regulars. We didn't feel like we needed to hear their personal stories and we felt a little neglected.   The last con, the price and portion. I hate hate hate to complain about this since it is a local restaurants. I am a huge advocate of local restaurants, however I felt that it was way overpriced for what we got. We ordered two glasses of red wine, nothing spectacular and two appetizers. The two appetizers were a cheese board and the porks belly. The cheeseboard was the saddest cheeseboard I've ever seen. There was one quarter size amount of honey, 3-4 different cheeses which were not very large in size and a few other fixings. The porks belly was probably the best thing we ordered. Our bill was about 50$ for two glasses of wine, a sad sad cheeseboard and some pork belly. All in all, we left broke and hungry.   The pros, the fact that it's a local restaurant. And we liked the decor inside.    I wish I would have liked this place more, but just not up to par I guess."}
{"text":"The wife and I had dinner at The Black Pig recently and it was a very nice dining experience.  Our tattooed server was friendly and attentive.  The food was delicious and the ambience we wonderful.  We had a seat by the window and we gazed at passers by as they walked through the Ohio City neighborhood.    My wife ordered the braised short ribs and I ordered the heritage pork chop.  Upon receiving our meals and tasting both, we decided to switch plates!  I loved the dark, decadent flavors of the short rib and my wife loved the flavor of the pork chop.  Both plates were a sizeable portion and my wife did not finish her pork chop, even with help from me.  I would order the braised short ribs again as it was pretty amazing.  We'll be back one day!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! Sitting at the Bar, love love the bartender, he is a creator of the finest libations. The cuisine is on point absolutely delicious!! This is a great little spot and if you sit at the bar very entertaining to say the least!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here twice- and it's pretty good!  I remember when this place used to be the old Firefly lounge- the food was never that great in that old place and it was always so empty. Not so much for The Black Pig!  I've been here for brunch and it was spectacular. Go for the Croque Madame- it's one hefty sandwich, but it is made soooo well with a big slab of gruyere.   Been here for dinner as well and got the short ribs- super flavorful and super filling. I'm glad they give you what you pay!  Definitely recommend The Black Pig for a \"no-regrets\" place to eat if you're on w. 25th. Much better than the previous establishment that used to be in the spot!"}
{"text":"Went to The Black Pig tonight for boyfriend's 25th birthday.   Service: Waitress was very helpful in answering our questions. I had requested when I made the reservation, to be seated where we could sit perpendicular, or at least a candle on the cake for dessert, anything to acknowledge his birthday. I understand they are not obligated to do this, but all the other restaurants we have visited for birthdays, anniversaries, etc., have always done something extra, at least even just wishing happy birthday. No acknowledgements by The Black Pig. :( Also, for a nice restaurant, where's the bread?  Appetizers:  - Pork Belly: this was the highlight - sweet glaze, tender, melt-in-your-mouth, nice big square. I would go back just for this, order maybe 2-3, and call it a meal. - Duck Confit: the waitress told us this was fried in fat, then refried again. It was good, but, I've had better.  - Gravy Frites: or otherwise, poutine. Tasty, but dry. Could use more gravy and cheese.  Entrees: We had a tough time deciding what to get, but finally decided on: - Ohio Beef: braised short rib was very tender, fall apart, tender. Steak was meh, needed the sauce, otherwise would have not been tasteful. Mushrooms that accompanied the dish was a nice touch. - Pork Schnitzel: everyone on Yelp raves about this, but somehow, I seem to be missing the point. The waitress also warned us it would be a little dry. Indeed. Needs more sauce. Otherwise, nicely fried. Bits of bacon added a nice touch.  Dessert: - Financier: small round cake topped with goat cheese cream. I liked the flavor profile, but felt that presentation of this was lacking, and also could have been moister, or maybe even with some ice cream on top. But really, couldn't they have done something nicer with the presentation?? Not even a sprig of mint or other garnish for added color.   Drink: - Flower Sour: definitely can taste the grapefruit, sourness covered up the alcohol taste, this was pretty good.  Overall, not sure if the service and food (presentation and taste) was worth the price. It came out to around 100 after tax for the above. Filling for two people."}
{"text":"First of all, this restaurant is fancy yet hipster. You probably do need to dress up a little cuz there are some decent amount of people in their 40s-60s who wear suit and ties to dine there. But the restaurant decor is very unique - it's like a stone/cave kinda building with some sort of old scent (visual not smell) that makes it less up tight.  I dont remember what I got but it was pretty decent. It's kind of a french/american fushion restaurant, where you do get to see some sort of \"liver\"dishes on the menu haha.  Parking is a little bit annoying - there's a two huge surface parking lots that are usually used for west side market, and it's about a 5 minute walk from the surface parking to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped into The Black Pig last night without a reservation, they didn't have a table but serve full menu at the bar! Ordered Brussels with bacon - very velvety and delicious. Beet salad with fennel and leek ash creme fraiche was remarkable. Mushroom angliotti was to die for. Very good all around!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but we had a party of 8 for Sunday brunch, which I didn't think was too much and they brought our food out two plates at a time over the course of 12 minutes which seemed odd."}
{"text":"I've been to the Black Pig twice now since it opened recently and I recommend it.  The service was perfectly great, the food was perfectly great, and the drinks were perfectly great.    From the name, I was expecting the menu to be more pork/bacon-centric, but really there are fewer dishes with bacon than you would find at any Michael Symon restaurant, which is fine with me.    For starters, the beet salad is really fantastic.  Lemony, with shredded beets and creme fraiche and some slim green beans.  Yum!  Their seasonal pumpkin soup was also great.    My favorite entree so far was the roasted chicken breast, which was deliciously savory and tender and came with a little brown sauce and these amazing roasted potatoes, which were the best I've ever had.  Seriously.    For dessert, both times I went I had the macarons, which were amazing and the best I've found in Cleveland.  The server said that the pastry chef makes them in-house, and they're lovely.  They had hazelnut, chocolate, and I think raspberry.    The atmosphere inside is comfy and contemporary, with nice exposed brick walls and an open kitchen in the back.    The Black Pig also has a really cool raised deck in the back where you can eat and/or drink.  They call it a rooftop patio, but it's really not; it's more of a raised deck that they built over their tiny private parking area.  Anyway, the deck is awesome and has a nice view of the skyline, even despite the gross cement block wall their neighbors built to try to block their view.    Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A great menu, many interesting options I would like to try.  I had the pork collar and it was the most tender piece of meat I have had in recent memory.  The sauce was slightly overreduced and a little salty, but almost in a good way if that makes sense.  The presentation of the micro greens and puree was awesome!   My wife got the short ribs which were equally impressive, we would both definitely return.  Docked 1 star due to atmosphere, we were sat in the backroom that didn't quite match the elegance of the food.  We felt like we were in a banquet hall leftover from the 80s.  I'm sure it will be renovated in the future for a complete experience."}
{"text":"As soon as my party was seated, we were well taken care of.  We never had empty glasses.  The waitress had really good recommendations and I ended up trying and loving foods that I would not have generally ordered.  The liver pate in the meat appetizer was really good, and I generally have an extremely negative attitude about liver.  My friends and I order 4 dishes and shared them.  I tried duck confit, and pork belly for the first time.  Plus we order tried and true favorites like steak and pork loin.  My absolute favorite dish was the duck confit.  At the end of the meal the owner/chef came out and answered some of our questions.  He was very talented and I could appreciate his love for what he is doing.  The food is all locally raised and grown and the prices are right on.  I highly recommend the Black Pig!"}
{"text":"If you've come to this review hoping to find wonderful descriptions of food and other eatables, keep going.  I'm here to talk about alcohol.  Black Pig is doing everything right.  Edgy enough beer list, cool enough wine list, freaking awesome cocktail list. Anyone who has the balls to put Fernet Branca on a menu deserves credit.  The drinks are inspired, edgy, and delicious.  A little strong, though, so tread carefully.  My favorite was the W 25th St Byrrh (their play on a Manhattan) but the Sticky Pig is great too.  If you like creative cocktails, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"As a native Clevelander, I am always excited to come home and try new restaurants.  My fiancée was in town and we discovered the Black Pig on a drive through Ohio City.    We were initially drawn in by the restaurant's curb appeal (exposed brick, lighting, and open windows with a view of Bridge Ave.)  However, we were seated in the back room, which feels like a different restaurant (white walls, carpeting, no music, sparse decor, and a view of the alley behind my old high school track).  Given that we currently live apart and were out to celebrate a special occasion, we kindly asked our server if there may be a table available in the front room.  She was noticeably annoyed and replied curtly, \"what's wrong with the back?\"  We immediately felt uncomfortable with her tone and embarrassed for voicing our concerns. After explaining the situation, she informed us that they had \"many reservations\", and that it probably would not be possible, but would check nonetheless.  Unsurprisingly, a table for two in the front room was immediately available.    Now, what makes this review so difficult to write is that the food we had was absolutely fantastic.  We ordered four plates to share (the cheese board, asparagus, mushroom agnolotti, and pork collar).  As a frequent traveler and foodie, I have been truly fortunate to enjoy some fine restaurants as part of my work.  I can honestly say that the mushroom agnolotti was one of the most memorable dishes  that I've had in the past year.  Texture and flavor were on point, and the quality of the ingredients allowed for a layering of flavor that I never knew could come from something so simple.  The pork collar is also not to be missed ...savory, tender, and \"falling off the bone\".    This unfortunately leads to our last not so pleasant experience with the staff.  Inspired by the quality of the meal, I decided to purchase a 50.00 gift card for my sister and brother-in-law, who live in town (he works in Ohio City).  As I approached the bar, before getting a word out, the male bartender curtly informed me that the place at the bar where I was standing was set for a reservation.  I apologized and quickly moved back towards the wall, while asking about the gift card.  He said it would take a minute.  Several minutes passed as he continued to serve, and chat with customers at the bar.  Then, however, a female staff member walked behind the bar, and upon seeing us, made a physical gesture to \"shoo\" us away from the bar, before telling us again that the bar seats were reserved.  Mind you, we were standing against the wall, away from the seats, and there was literally nowhere else to stand. After another minute or two, we decided to abandon the purchase and leave.      I don't often write internet reviews, and have never negatively reviewed a business.  That being said, I don't know that I've ever had a dining experience where I felt quite the way I did after leaving the Black Pig.  Whether intentional or not, we both felt like a bother to the staff.  As previously mentioned, I live in San Francisco and travel both domestically and internationally with regularity.  I recognize the diversity of expression that exists in different places, and that good old midwestern \"niceness\" is not valued everywhere (ironically, sometimes not even in the Midwest).  However, not once, in SF or anywhere for that matter, have I felt \"unwanted\" in an establishment.    I love Cleveland and Ohio City, and am happy to experience the city's burgeoning restaurant scene, in which the BP should factor prominently.  Judging solely on the food, I would not hesitate to take my friends from SF in an effort to show off Cleveland's food scene.  However, I would hope that the staff strongly considers reviews such as this, and makes a concerted effort to treat its customers with greater respect.   Everyone is entitled to a bad night at work.  However, when such an attitude is displayed by not one, but three staff members, it defies mere coincidence, and hints at a pervasive  unrest within the establishment."}
{"text":"Let me say: This would have been a five-star review if we had been able to see, literally, anything during our visit. Being in the (again, literal) dark only dropped one star from my rating, though - it was that good.  We did not have a reservation, but were accommodated in the back dining room. Our server was a bit cool toward us - seems to be the way of service in this area. Service was well-timed, though, which I appreciate as much as - maybe more so than - friendliness.  After fumbling with our phones, we managed to pick our drinks (beer), appetizer (charcuterie board), and entrees (pork tenderloin and mushroom agnolotti). We had to ask the runner to point to our board, but once we knew what we were eating, it was excellently-made pickles, chicken-liver pate (which I usually avoid but this had a nice texture, very easy to eat), and several kinds of house-cured meats. Probably one of the better boards we've had, to be honest. Our entrees were superb. Perfectly-cooked pork with a sweet touch of leeks and bacon; and a deeply-flavored mushroom sauce that offset the chard and spicy filling of the agnolotti. It was good enough to throw two hyphenated adjective-verb pairings in the last sentence.  We ordered a dessert to split - the cake with earl grey and lavender crème Anglaise. Not too sweet, a great end to a delicious and unique dinner. The Black Pig set the bar high for the rest of our Cleveland trip."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and really enjoyed the food. I had the banana foster French toast and it was delicious. The candied bacon on it was out of this world, and the portion was huge. Also they have mimosa pitchers which are a good deal over getting a glass or two! Only negative is that they open at 11 for brunch which seems kind of late and parking is hard to find. I would like to return for their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"The food was off the chain, but it was a long process.  A solid 45 minutes until our first course came, and then two more drinks before the second, and then two more drinks before the third.  I was BLITZED.  The waitress apologized and hooked us up with a free round (that was much appreciated, but not the next day).  I asked her if this was normal, and she said \"yes\".  It sounds like they serve more people than their kitchen can handle.  But if you're in for a long dinner (think le petit, but longer), this is definitely worth it.   We didn't get pig, we each got a tasting menu (hers, the three-course pasta, mine an apple salad, skate wing entree, and some dessert i can't remember because at that point in the night the trees were talking avocados and i don't remember paying sorry if we didn't pay I WAS DRUNK).    What I do remember though, is how incredibly F*CKING DOPE the pasta dishes were, all handmade. Smoked walleye and creme freche tortellini with caviar; some open faced ravioli looking mother f*ckers with crumbled sausage; some other dish.  This place should just serve pasta.  They could have a Squid Ink Sausage Pasta, and call it The Black Pig.... I'M COMING FOR YOUR JOB DOUG TRATTNER.  The Skate Wing was also fantastic, in case ANYONE is still reading.    NO ONE COULD HAVE LANDED THAT PLANE."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the brunch menu as we've been here on three different occasions for brunch. We've been with a group of 6 and then twice more with a group of 3 and then just my husband and I. Each time with a reservation the staff greets you as if they are bothered to interact. The wait service has been consistent with the same attitude each time.   The drinks were well prepared and one of the favorites of the meal. Moving on to the food, there were highs and lows. The bread in the banana foster was excellent and stood out amidst the sweet of the foster. The potatoes with the eggs meal were also very flavorful. The bacon was the biggest disappointment. The crispy came from overuse of a blow torch with the sugar because it was far too chewy in the middle. This happened on all three occasions.   The menu, in my opinion, lacked variety. If you're looking for sweet over savory you have three options between fruit, yogurt, or banana foster. Might try Black Pig for dinner, but for brunch, there are far better options out there especially in this area."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend here on a Saturday. Great happy hour prices, but even better food. We ended up just splitting three appetizers thinking we would move onto another place for more food, and I totally regret that choice. We shared the gravy frites, pork belly, and the duck confit. All three were fantastic, as were the sidecar cocktails made from the excellent bartender. I will certainly be back to have an entree, and try the charcuterie."}
{"text":"It was my first time at the new BP location. Not much changed on the patio or structurally inside since Light Bistro (R.I.P.) moved out.   We ordered the mushroom appetiser. I didn't know what to expect, but for some reason I had an image of stuffed mushrooms in my mind. Boy was I wrong. We got a very small selection of various shaped and sized mushrooms on a plate sparsely covered in lettuce. The dish was topped with a runny egg and the mushrooms tasted overall salty, but not necessarily in a bad way. This app is to be split by no more than two people as it is very small.   I got the Petite Filet for my main. It was far from petite though. It was definitely double what other places serve as petite or \"twin medallions.\" It was served with roasted cauliflower, purple and white which were amazing, and big spring onion stalks. Some of the steak was a bit too well done for me though.   We sat on the patio. Service was slow from the kitchen and our waitress didn't check on us to often. My friend said his two cocktails were not that flavorful. All in all it was good, but it isn't my favorite in the city. I'm between a 3 & 4 on this rating. Since the mains were pretty good (my friend's burger included) I'll go with 4."}
{"text":"Really friendly, nice staff. Well cooked foods. My salmon was perfect at medium well atop a bed of fall veggies and the pork belly starter was delicious. Smaller portions one might thing, but I think for once it is a portion that you can with good health in mind eat everything you're served. Cool idea of an elevated patio out back with semi obstructed downtown (and parking lot) views. Nicely, modernly, decorated inside with cool unique art pieces on the brick walls."}
{"text":"So up my ally I'm 5 dishes in and all home runs  How rare is that?! Smart wine list and excellent service. So glad I had the chance to eat here on my layover in Cleveland"}
{"text":"3.5stars that I'll bump to 4 for good potential... And giving them the benefit of the doubt with regard to the poor seasoning.  Came for dinner on a Sat night with my bf. There were a few other tables of guests, but no crowd and no wait. I tend to shy away from places without a crowd that clearly lives to eat there, but glad we tried it.  Food: I got the roasted duck and it was delicious. The bf doesn't usually like duck unless it's at a Chinese restaurant, but even he liked it. It came with a duck meatball that I couldn't eat because it was just too salty. We ended up eating it with his steak that must not have been seasoned at all. He got the Ohio Beef, which came with short rib and steak. The short rib was done perfectly!  It was seasoned well, tender, fall off the bone, melt in your mouth. The steak, on the other hand, tasted like nothing. Good thing we had the super salty duck meatball to eat it with.   Service: the staff were friendly, attentive, and helpful. The food took way too long to come out. Good thing I had a good glass of wine to drink while I waited. But if I had known the food takes so long, I would have gotten an appetizer or a salad to hold me over.  We'll likely give them a second try and see if seasoning is better on another night with other choices from the menu. But if not, they likely will not ever get a 3rd try...  Great potential with a little more attention to detail. Taste your food for seasoning please!  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist.  I guess I'll come along if someone wants to go. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going. If they insist, I may come and not eat, or may just see them some other time."}
{"text":"I've said it before, but I feel the need to say it again: The Black Pig is the real deal! Having returned since my initial visit for another dinner and a brunch, I'm back with my brunch recommendations and, in general, more praise for the bold, rich flavors on their menu, their attention to detail, and overall quality of food and service.   Check out Black Pig's brunch at your earliest convenience and be sure not to miss:  - Their house made sausage: delicate, light, and jam-packed with flavor!  - Anything that comes with a side of their heavenly roast potatoes, as crispy as can be! - Bananas Foster French Toast (need I say more?)  - Short Rib Hash, obviously. - Bruleed Bacon, also obviously!  Our waitress on this most recent foray was warm and welcoming. As others have noted, the service here is leisurely, but I for one am happy to linger over a meal this fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food in a super inviting and cozy atmosphere. However, the service was apathetic and left much to be desired. The hangar steak, mushroom pasta and pork tenderloin are awesome, as are the pork rinds, (spicy-- ahhh choo!). The drinks were okay. Had to ask for a couple of them to be topped off...   Overall, delicious food and lovely surroundings."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the Black Pig when it was on 25th - it had a great happy hour and great drinks.  Generally I'd just order a burger or the bahn mi though.  I knew their moving to the old \"Light Bistro\" also was supposed to bring about a slightly higher end feel (though they still have burgers and bahn mis!).  I didn't know what that meant, but tried it and was incredibly impressed.  We ordered the chartcuterie tray, which is what the chef is known for.  He creates his own sausages, pates, etc., with defined flavors and they perfectly complimented the mustard, beet and pickle add-ons.  I especially loved the, I think it was Captain Morgan styled cutlet?  So good!  For dinner, I had the pork collar and my fiance got the filet.  Both were well presented and perfectly cooked.  Very flavorful and they both tied in with their sides.    It was a great meal.  Their back room is perfect for events (that's where we sat and I was envisioning birthdayparties or rehersal dinners) and we will ABSOLUTELY be back.  Great move, Black Pig, great move!"}
{"text":"Ummm...why has it taken me so long to eat here?  It was wonderful!!  Lucky for my party, we got to Black Pig during happy hour time.  We were sat quickly and our friendly server detailed their amazing sounding drinks that were included in the drink special.  We got the Sticky Pig and the Ram Jam.  Both drinks were complex, and absolutely delicious!!    For dinner, we started the meal with a $4 pate and pickle plate.  It being Lent and all, I didn't try the pate but my table said things along these lines:  \"Mmm... sooo good\" \"Better than L'Albatros\" \"How can this only be $4?\" \"Good pickles\"  ---  that one was me  Then for dinner we got the burgers and the vegie bahn mi.  Great sandwiches and along the the fries (which could be substituted for other sides) and not a one of us finished our plate!  Several plates of mussels and scallops went by and with each plate, I was impressed!    So let's see here.  Great service.  Great food.  Great prices!  I'll be back...and soon!!!"}
{"text":"The Black Pig is always on top of my list when bring in friends to eat. The brunch is really good and the prices are reasonable. My favorite is the short rib hash which is so full of MEAT which is a blast! Also tried the seasonal omelet and loved their spicy sauce. Ordered chicken liver today - wild but still delicious! We had mimosa as our drink - cute and stylish. Can't say enough good words about it but the only, I mean only, thing is it's a bit slow, but we understand that we are served with good, thoroughly cooked, well seasoned food. Will definitely go back and bring more friends there."}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly and prompt server, hostess was not the best... I had the schnitzel - I lived in Germany for a few months so my standards are pretty high.  This dish does not compare to the schnitzel that I had in Germany but it was still pretty good and I would recommend it if someone is looking for a taste of Deutschland!"}
{"text":"Review is for HAPPY HOUR! :) We decided to do a happy hour, after researching we picked The Black Pig. We are very pleased that we did! $3-$4-$5 menu is awesome! We ordered the Frittes, Pate Melt, Cuban, and Pork Belly. The best things were definitely the sandwiches. Both were $3 for a half...and i would easily eat 2 whole Pate Melts. They were utterly delicious. The pork belly was a little too fatty, but still very tasty is really enjoyed the hash that accompanied it. The frittes were, well, frittes, can't say they were anything special if compared to neighbors. All in all with several drinks we walked out of there under $40. and we were very satisfied with everything. We will be back for sure maybe try some entrees, but they Happy Hour one of the best Ive seen."}
{"text":"The best flavored cheeseburger I have ever eaten as well as the braised short rib. However, I was very disappointed in the taste of the desserts. I had both the banana style creme brulee and the lemon cake which I did not like at all"}
{"text":"Wow!  A group of us headed over to the Black Pig for brunch.  We loved everything about the place.  The outside sign is awesome.  The entire staff was very welcoming and friendly.  The atmosphere is great.  Each of us ordered something different off their brunch menu.  Everything came out amazing!  I ordered the Black Pig Burger that comes with shallot jam, mushrooms, brie, and aioli.  AWESOME!I love a good burger and this place has the best burger I have ever had! We were grateful that their portion sizes are large so that we could all sample each of our brunch choices.  When we are all back in town - we will definitely be back!  I know that their menu changes because they get local, seasonal ingredients, but I sure do hope they have that burger when I come back."}
{"text":"From service to food to atmosphere, Black Pig gets 5 stars without a mere second thought.   This was the destination for my birthday for myself and 8 of my girlfriends. I started off with a Pimm's Cup, bourbon, ginger beer and a few other extras to make this a delicious and refreshing cocktail. Needless to say, I drank 5 throughout a 4 hour time span.  We started with the Meat and Cheese boards. I will say that these are by far the best meat and cheese boards you can get in Cleveland!  For dinner I had the pork belly appetizer and a Caesar salad. The pork belly was a first for me but I read several Yelp reviews saying that it was a must so I went for it. It was delicious! I have never had meat so tender, it seemed to melt in my mouth. The Caeser salad was also to die for...it came with shrimp toast and it was AMAZING. My only very tiny complaint was that the salad could have had a tad bit more dressing. (I do realize that I could have asked for more)  We sat on the rooftop which was such a great atmosphere hence why we didn't venture to any other bars and stayed here until 1:30 am. On top of the great atmosphere, our service was great!   As stated earlier, this was a birthday dinner for myself so I came up from a trip to the restroom to the whole rooftop patio singing happy birthday to me...how fun!   My friends had ordered the apple bread pudding and the cocoa dusted chocolate truffles. Hands down best desserts that you can find on w.25th. The bread pudding had so much flavor and the truffles were out of this world.  Needless to say, I WILL be back Black Pig very soon!"}
{"text":"Get the Big Board!!  Recently visited Cleveland for the weekend and it turned into an all out food and beer-fest. We went to all the hotspots, Greenhouse Tavern, Bar Cento, and Lola, and were slightly underwhelmed by each. We found ourselves at the Black Pig in the middle of our brew tour in Ohio City and were blown away!  The service was excellent, and our bartender Davey was awesome. He recommended the meat and cheese board and it was spot on. All of the meats are made in-house and the cheeses were delish. The best part were the accompaniments. The red wine poached pears with the blue cheese, the raspberries with the liver mousse, and the creme de la creme was the golden raisin and orange compote that was served with a cheese that I will never remember the name of. This was place was exactly what we were looking for and were  compelled to write about it. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"So, I can't go into huge details about their entire menu because I haven't officially dined here. I attended a private function before they opened where I sampled all sorts of meats and pate. Amazing. I have come for cocktails. Also amazing. Get the sticky pig - bourbon and some other amazing things - probably some bacon infused goodness in there. They also , oddly enough, have really good fries. I also came for dessert - apple bread pudding and some chocolate mousse thing. OMFreakingGawd. The dessert is incredible!   The inside is really very nice. DragonFly, who previously occupied this space, could never figure out what they were - was it a club? A restaurant? A bar? Who knows! The space seemed awkward and dark. The owner here has certainly figured out how to make the space work. Very cool. Also worth noting - the bartender Juan is an incredibly cool dude... he creates a really fun environment at the bar entertaining customers with conversation. I'm a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Made a reservation here after our favorite spot (Lolita in Tremont) was booked up for valentines day weekend.  First impressions on interior is that it was a little small, but the brick walls gave it a nice vintage feel. We ordered our drinks, an 1865 sour, and and requested a blackberry mojito, but the server didn't think the bar would be able to make it, so I settled for another drink. The server noticed that my partner and I had switched drinks, and realized I didn't like it. She offered to bring me another, but I kindly refused and said it was fine. Later she brought me a plain mojito, and ended up not charging us for the first drink even though we drank all three. (extra points for her!). Overall I wasn't too impressed with the flavors of the drinks, especially for the size to price ratio, but I would say they were strong enough.  We ordered the braised pork belly appetizer on other yelpers recommendations, and we definitely were not disappointed. Crispy on the outside, deliciously fatty/ melt in your mouth interior. I refrained my inner urges to lick the plate.  For our entrees, we chose the shortribs and lamb fettucine. My boyfriend happened to love the lamb fettucine, although I felt there was something off about the flavors. The portion size was good though, not as small as I would expect at this kind of restaurant. My pork shortribs were cooked to perfection, and I ended up taking one home because the portion was so big. I will say though that the bed of polenta it was served on was lackluster, actually all the garnishes/ sides seemed to be lackluster, and didn't really add anything to the dishes. While Lolita's polenta is amazingly creamy, melt in your mouth, cheesy....this polenta was gritty, flavorless, and overall just disappointing.  On the whole, we enjoyed our experience here, and would probably return. Service and food didn't disappoint overall, and I feel I could recommend this restaurant to others in confidence. I'd also be curious to try other entrees on their menu, including their Sunday brunch option. Happy eating!"}
