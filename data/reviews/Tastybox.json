{"text":"Wow!  What a find.  Truly a unique and personal gastronomic experience.   Great selection of delicious and healthy plates.  My only regret is that this restaurant isn't near where I live."}
{"text":"An innovative idea that seems like someone should have thought of it all along!  Healthy, balanced meals (as good as you would prepare for yourself) that are also delicious (probably way more delicious than you would prepare on any given day) and are ready to go for lunch or dinner.  The servings are beyond generous (neither my husband nor myself could finish a whole meal).  Each box really is a whole meal, with fruit for a healthy dessert or snack later on.  The price was very reasonable for a meal that could easily be lunch and dinner for many people.  Oh, and the box itself is adorable, reusable, and microwaveable.

So far, we have tried the Diablo Beans, the Southern Comfort chicken dish, and the Umame Mushrooms and Tofu. The tastes combine really nicely and nothing is the standard, quickly thrown-together ingredients you come to expect from fast food.  For instance, one dish had caramelized red cabbage that was amazing - not your usual side.  The beans had pickled onion, which, again, really brought a depth of flavor and exotic taste to what you might assume would be a bland meal (you'd assume wrong).  

For a to-go concept restaurant, the inside seating space is really chic and comfortable with convenient, free parking around back - not so easy to find downtown.  The staff is lovely.  It's a great place for a lunch get-together.  And right next door is a great little coffee shop/hangout (Street Coffee), run by the same owner. Everything you could want!

We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"If you are ready to charge your body and refuel your soul look no further than Tasty Box. Today was my first time trying Preethy's food and my tastebuds cannot stop craving this new wave of fresh forward tastiness. I walked out with The Hawker-vegan and The Alchemist-vegetarian. These meals hit the spot with a balance flavor, the curried lentils had a strong umami quality. Not only is the food packed with nutrition the portions are perfect for on the go or take home. Did I mention they are Eco-friendly restuarant?! They reduce, reuse, recycle with a 5PP Polypropylene plastic safe tray. I highly recommend Tasty Box can't wait for my next meal."}
{"text":"Cute little house with great tasty food. They had a few choices that including vegetarian and vegan options and allowed us to taste them all. Each one was delicious. The space is casual and relaxing and s great find!"}
{"text":"Love the Tastybox concept, Great food portions and a very friendly staff. Great vegetarian options. First time eating tofu and was very impressed with the tofu and mushrooms dish, definitely one of my favorites. walkable from downtown phoenix. Very travel friendly for a grab and go healthy dish."}
{"text":"Tasty box is seriously good food.  I went there on a Tuesday and was able to sample many of their dishes.  The food is taken from world cusine and the flavors are outstanding.  I had the capri-chickpeas and a chicken dish.  The food is very fresh, the vegetables are crisp and everything is made to order.

The restaurant itself looks like a house from the outside, but you can see Tastybox sign. You can park around back and getting in and out is easy. 

I think our food was around $10 and I would have paid twice that and been happy."}
{"text":"Went into tasty box today for some sampling and couldn't resist to get some. Tried the Capri- chickpeas with lemon caper sauce... the eggplant that it comes with is deLish!!! 
They have a room set up with a whiteboard, perfect for work meetings and the staff is very helpful!"}
{"text":"Really great affordable food. Great service. The owners are great. It's nice to be able to eat healthy inexpensively and have it taste great!"}
{"text":"One of a kind pearl of a lunch spot for the individuals who need to eat healthily and take a chance at a new restaurant. Constrained choices, yet taste them all and pick your top choice. I left fulfilled and not \"stuffed.\" I can hardly wait to return!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent find on my trip to Phoenix.  The food comes in little bento boxes.  I ordered the turkey pita wrap, cucumber yogurt, celery and fruit.  The woman who does all of the cooking (not the owner) let me sample all 3 main plates before ordering.  All 3 were fantastic but I was sooo hungry I ordered what appeared to be the most filling dish.  I loved the turkey pita and cucumber sauce, but the celery was uninspiring.  The fruit was just a small cut up orange.  I was still hungry after eating the entire meal so I ordered another turkey pita.  Overall mixed results but I loved the main course.  The place is designed really beautifully (look at all the little rooms), but the portions need to be larger."}
{"text":"Tastybox has it down. A rotating, seasonally inspired menu with the most delicious vegetarian and vegan cuisine in Phoenix. The chickpea curry on rice with coconut and cabbage stir fry?! Amazing. The flavor combinations are certainly well thought out by someone with a mind for piquing each and every sensor on the tongue.

It's also SO fast. Service is amazing. The interior is beautiful, and they seem to do a good job at recycling! Perfect for the downtown area that it occupies. The parking is amazing as well, and there is a coffee shop right next door.

Get in here people. Tastybox is the one."}
{"text":"What a great idea! portion controlled healthy meals in a convenient plastic togo box. Reminds me of a bento box. Food packed a lot of flavor. I'm not a vegetarian, but I thought the veggie options were better than the meat options (owner let us sample everything). I had the Umami box. It didn't disappoint. It's a great place if you want something healthy while trying to watch your portion control. Would come here again. Fast, easy and super clean place."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's awesome and very delicious. Great price so it's worth it in my opinion you should go"}
{"text":"Wow!! I'm disappointed that I haven't discovered this place earlier! The food is incredibly tasty. The whole idea and concept of bento boxes are unique and creative. The converted house is groovy and very inviting and clean. The owner is super kind and great to talk to! She let's you try samples if you don't know what to get. Overall, I cannot wait to come back later in the week!"}
{"text":"This place was completely delicious and friendly. Everything was really healthy yet surprisingly yummy. The owner served us samples of all the meals and was super inviting and informative. Plus, the private lot was really convenient. Look no further for a quick, healthy lunch option. No joke, it took less than half an hour to park, order, eat and leave."}
{"text":"What a neat concept, first time I've seen their version of cultural fusion.   I really liked the brand marketing but bottom line the food taste great.  Found it through Yelp on our flight in to Phoenix and it was so good we came back for lunch on our way back to Chicago."}
{"text":"Tasty box was pretty cool.  Unique place, great concept, and great food for people with allergies.  Food tasted very good as well.  Unique healthy flavors.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, and healthy lunch/dinner options, and they provide samples before you choose! 
They cater too and it's been a hit with our group with different dietary preferences (vegan/veg/carnivores)!
Packing has been great for taking meals to work or home/catered events for busy professionals like me. 
Prices are reasonable. 
The customer service is excellent--very sweet and personable. 
The place is a nice mix of quaint and hipster without being too much. The owner is often there too and she's so lovely! 
Can't wait for them to expand to more days in the week. 

There is also a coffee shop next door that's worth checking out too (wifi/quiet/good ambiance)! My significant other loves their coffee. 

I'm picky and it doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Tastybox is such a great concept in Phoenix, it's bento taken to a new level! As a vegan, it's so nice to know that I can always get something to eat there, and that it will be healthy, fresh and full of flavor. The service was excellent by Susan."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden gems of the Phoenix food scene. Fast and genuinely friendly service, healthy food that is delicious, and a menu that never gets boring. I could eat here every day and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"The best lunch option in the area!  Quick, fresh, healthy and delicious! The staff working were super nice and gave me a sample of the day's other two offerings while they assembled my box. Both of the other samples were so good, I want to come back for those too. I am a carnivore, but have to say I liked the vegan and vegetarian entrees just as much."}
{"text":"Lunch only concepts in the valley are pretty few and far between.  Little Miss BBQ is one (and a legendary one at that) and Noble Eatery also comes to mind.  Beyond that, I'm hard pressed to think of many lunch only spots that have stuck to that business model and flourished.  Dr. Preethy Kaibara (a local family medical physician and instructor) seems to think her lunch concept has what it takes to prosper amongst the workday lunch crowds and most certainly brings some unique qualities to the table.  As I'm not around Downtown during the work week lunch hour, Saturday was the only day of the week I could try out this new creation.  So how does it stack up?

Nestled in the middle of a small row of bungalows on the east side of 7th Street just north of Fillmore, Tasty Box is well positioned to take advantage of the throngs of weekday Downtown workers eager for a quick meal on the go.  Tasty Box gears much of their menu to the Downtown area's abundant vegan and vegetarian crowd with menus suited to both of those demographics.  But they also offer a healthy meat based meal each day as well.  The variety of offerings each day is pretty limited and varies depending on which day you go.

Here's the basic gist.  They have a Monday/Wednesday/Friday menu and a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday menu.  Each day you have three choices: a meat based meal, a vegetarian meal, or a vegan meal (all of which are 600 calories or less).  If you're coming here for the first time as I did, Preethy will happily give you small cup samples of each to determine which flavor profile appeals to you.  Once you choose your meal, you can eat in and your meal will be served on a paper tray.  Or if you want to just get it to go (here's where the box part comes in) you get your meal in one of their reusable, recyclable, and dishwasher safe to go boxes.  As an added perk, you can bring the box back with you on your next visit and get a discount off your next meal.  So essentially quick healthy food delivered in an environmentally sustainable manner.

After testing all of their Tues/Thurs/Sat menu items, I chose the item that had the most appeal on an unusually cold winter day.  The Urban Cowboy meal is highlighted by a healthy portion of their turkey chili with beans plus sides of french bread, seasonal fruit (in this case orange slices), and some corn mixed in with bacon and rosemary.  As soon as I ordered up front, the food was in my hands right as I finished swiping my credit card.  Total cost including tax, about $11.  The bungalow itself has the look and feel of a neighborhood coffee house (and they do serve Street Coffee's products here by the way) with segmented rooms that all totaled can hold about 25-30 people at a time.  I grabbed a spot in the back meeting room.

The chili was just what a cold winter day ordered.  Piping hot but not real spicy and the french bread was perfect for soaking up all the juices.  The corn/bacon/rosemary mix was a pretty solid mix of sweet and salty, though I will say the bacon was the least pronounced (probably by design).  It would be nice to have the option to customize main dishes and sides rather than have just three choices and that's it.  But given the small scale of the operation I can mostly understand why Preethy keeps it simple for her clientele.  

In addition to her focus on sustainability, Preethy also features art on the walls for sale made by children from the group Free Arts for Abused Children of Arizona and also partners with Saint Mary's Food Bank and the Arizona Women's Education Center to employ staff looking to get into culinary careers.  All of this on top of the fact that she has a family medical practice and her job as a medical school instructor.  So yeah, Preethy is most definitely someone easy to cheer for and admire and offers a business model perfect for the progressive minded residents of the Downtown Phoenix area.  I hope it continues to grow and hopefully offers up even more great food choices.  But if Preethy is too busy running for President by then, I'll totally understand."}
{"text":"Honestly great customer service, friendly staff, rapid social media response, great food, easy to find location, next to a coffee shop, and overall just a good time"}
{"text":"Not only is the food wonderful the staff is friendly and makes you feel at home!!  The lemongrass chicken was out of this world."}
{"text":"I have wanting to try Tasty Box for awhile and it was definitely worth the wait. Fresh, delicious food and great customer service. I had the Hawker, which was the best meal I have had in a long time. Curried lentils, rice, spinach, blackened greens beans and carrot salad in mango sauce. Yum! And a great price, too.  They have vegan and vegetarian options, plus options for meat eaters.  The owner is super friendly and allows you to sample each dish before you try it. You can tell she really has a passion for her craft. Everything was so flavorful and had me talking about it all day. They rotate the menu through the week so there are always new things to try. The place itself is really cool. It's an old bungalow with a relaxed vibe with different rooms to enjoy your meal. It's also connected to Street Coffee, which has some great coffee and other treats"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. There's no other way to describe it. It can have a line at times, but it's well-worth it. If I worked close enough, I'll would have it on a daily basis. It's that good. 
I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I love the food and design philosophy. The food is simple, balanced, and refreshing! Every dish is very unique and from different countries which is a cool idea. The owner has a awesome philosophy and makes great food.  The restaurant is very clean and has a cute open floor plan. I love the reusable bento trays and take them home to use. Everyone should definitely check out tasty box."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE...Unique Unique Unique.  Love the food, such an amazing menu with incredible flavors.  There is nothing like this in Phoenix! Great atmosphere with different casual rooms for dining.  They even have a private room with a huge table and white board for meetings.  A must for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Everything here was delicious and didn't leave you feeling disgusting after your meal. The service was very good and the lady working there was very nice. It is a bit hard to find but worth the search and even though the menu is limited everything was very good. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been in about 4 times this month alone!  (: I love the healthy and delicious options, your entire plate is 600 calories or less, which is A++ in my book! As others have stated you do have the option of sampling the menu before ordering. Don't forget to bring in your bento box for an additional .50 cents off your next order
I cannot even express in words alone how good they can make vegan taste! Hey even my extremely picky eater hubby loves their vegan pate, which in return makes me sooo happy(:
My only gripe is the price, it's a little overpriced for what it is, but I'm okay with paying it because it's the only healthy lunch option I have in walking distance to ASU."}
{"text":"Drove by a few times so finally decided to try it today and it was delicious! I had the vegan option even though I'm not vegan and it was so good and very filling. Can't wait to try some of their other options!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, the concept, the message, the food is so flavorful and gives me something to look forward to for lunch"}
{"text":"I came here due to a fellow yelper friend and his review. I trust his judgement very much and as usual, find myself aggreeing. 
I love this artsy part of town and with Banner Health down the street (one of the hospitals I work at), it gives me a reason to explore. 

A heads up that it is very easy to miss the entrance to this place... there's only one and the second driveway is for exits only. I did a uturn. You can identify the building as a series of 3, quaint homes that look like little coffee houses. You park in the back and walk in through the back door where you are immediately greeted. On Mon/Wed/Fri you have one type of option and then Tues/Thurs/Sat are another choice. For these choices theres healthy option of meat, vegetarian, and Vegan regardless of the day. She let me try each type particular to the day and they were all very good. 

I grabbed the lunch bento that consisted of bbq chicken, pickled cabbage, roll, and oranges. It was pretty good. I really like the fact that they keep the concept simple and it stays within healthy only options. Sorry but no cheating here.  it filled me up without feeling bloated and gross. 
I absolutely love it. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Ambiance: This former house turned restaurant offers several rooms to dine in. All well decorated with several sitting options, table, bar, bench etc. Definitely unique as you'll feel your in someone's home but not really. Plenty of parking in the back (shared with coffee shop next door). Patrons are all ages with emphasis on the health conscious crowd.

Food: Served in bento boxes (compartmentalized plastic box). Menu rotates daily but always offers meat/veggie/vegan options. Each box has a main, two sides and fruit (a perfectly balance, healthy and delicious meal!). The four limb was quite good. Portions suitable for most. 

Price: Excellent! Only ten dollars.

Service: Food served quickly. The owner, a physician, knows the food well and is sincerely motivated to offer healthy and reasonable priced meals.

Overall: An excellent lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent food. We were able to taste the 3 different meals before we ordered. I had The urban cowboy. The turkey chili was very tasty. I enjoyed adding the bacon and rosemary corn to it. The bread was moist and went great with the chili. The fresh oranges were so sweet! My husband had the Casablanca. Green bean salad he thought was very tasty. The cashew popcorn was delicious!! Overall we had an awesome meal!!"}
{"text":"Unique gem of a lunch spot for those who want to eat healthy and try something different.   Limited options,  but taste them all and pick your favorite.  Then take your bento box home to use again.  I went away satisfied and not \"stuffed.\"  Too bad so far from my home as can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Tastybox today after urging from our friends--so sorry I waited so long! There are two menus depending on the day of the week, and each menu includes a meat option, a vegetarian option and a vegan option. They'll encourage you to sample all three, which only makes the choice more difficult. Although these are limited options, each is a full meal and under 600 calories. They're served in reusable boxes unless you request a compostable plate, and you'll get a discount on your meal when you bring a container back. You won't be disappointed with the rich, flavorful and healthful choices. The restaurant itself is a converted house with a bright, airy feel and plenty of space. We'll certainly be back often!"}
{"text":"Missed our connecting flight so had to stay in Phoenix overnight. Walked from our motel to the nearest restaurant we could find. Discovered a unique little restaurant called TastyBox. Very wonderful blend of flavors in the Jefé dish we ordered.  Lunch was served promptly by very personable server. They even provided complimentary samples of a couple of their entrees and dessert while we waited for our order. If we are ever in the area would definitely drop in again."}
{"text":"The owners philosophy for this place is great and she's very kind and inviting. The food is great, tasty and well balanced.

 When I went to Japan I often found myself wondering why America has such shitty balance when it comes to food and why AZ can't have more fast food lunch's that are well balanced. Well rest assured because tasty box is the answer to my desire for such a place in AZ. 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have an extremely busy on-the-go lifestyle so I usually eat what's fast and convenient. I love that it's portioned and well packaged in a nifty microwaveable box so I can just warm it for later. I love all the diverse cultural dishes and the space is awesome if you want to get some work done! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some lunch today and am so glad I did! I had the Eight Limb but she let me try all three and they were all delicious.  I am definitely gonna come back another day to try her other options.  Great vibe to the place as well.. I could definitely see my self setting up my laptop for a few hours or hosting a meeting there.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome concept, and nice owner. I feel like you can't ask for much more. The food was truly delicious and cooked with real food that you can immediately tell upon testing the samples. The inside is really nice and comfortable with lots of seating. You can also bring back your bento box which I believe is genius and smart for the environment as well. Give this place a try you won't be unsatisfied."}
{"text":"A little hard to find but worth the effort!  I had the vegetarian Capri \"bento\". The chickpeas were seasoned just right!  The eggplant was also very good!  Would definitely come here again when back in town!  The take home bento container for reuse was an added plus!"}
{"text":"Very unique place! The food is GREAT! Clean food with great vegan options as well. The location can't be any better, if you aren't in the mood for food go next door for some coffee. The vibrations are great as well as the set up of both places. Strong wifi connection for anyone that needs access. The owner is passionate about both places and has done an outstanding job! Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Yum!!! This place was delicious and special. The women running it are awesome! They walk you through their purpose and their delicious food and you can try a bit of each box option for the day to make your choice. The food was excellent and I appreciated the whole experience. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Tastybox is such a great concept - it's bento taken to a new level! As a vegan, it's so nice to know that I can always get something to eat there, and that it will be healthy, fresh and full of flavor.

The menu is limited, with basically six options per week (rotating menu/every-other-day) but that actually helps with planning. \"On Wednesdays we get chickpeas!\" Today I had the \"Eight Limb\" with curried chickpeas on rice, pickled red peppers, a coconut/cabbage slaw and orange slices. It hit the spot. I'd like the curried chickpeas to be a bit spicier, but I know they have to support all palates. I've had the \"Bonita\" on the spring/summer menu as well, which has white beans in a Romesco sauce. I liked the curry better, but both are great. My portion today was just right - a little more than I could eat in one sitting.

I always get the food to go, and the service has been great. I call a few minutes in advance and they are usually ready for me when I arrive (or close to it). The boxes are microwavable, so you can do a quick re-heat if needed. You can also return the boxes for $.50 off your next order. The services is always friendly and prompt. I also like that they support Free Arts of Arizona by displaying their artwork and making it available for purchase (to benefit the non-profit). That's a great way to give back to the community (and the art is great!).  

I hope the business booms so they can sustain having more vegan options every day!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat at in Phoenix! Amazing, healthy food with awesome ambience. Preethy the owner has beautiful energy and makes me want to go hear every time I'm in Phoenix for work. Thank you Carrie too-she does the bomb cooking. Go Tastybox"}
{"text":"Good budget option in the PCC. 
Healthy and fresh, staff guest interaction can be improved however and the overall process of ordering / getting your food can be improved (current system is slow and unorganized).

I'll be back however!"}
{"text":"I came in thinking this was a different type of establishment based off the name.....I do love me some tasty box"}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem right near my office.  It has been challenging finding vegan options near work, so it was serendipitous that I found this little placed nestled into a converted craftsman house on 7th street.  

I'm of the mindset that food is imbued with the characteristics of those who prepare it.  The woman who greeted me and served my lunch was just a treasure.  

Loved the packaging and my lunch was both delicious and nourishing.  

I also give high marks for a bathroom that was immaculate.   It says something about an establishment that keeps a tidy house."}
{"text":"I love the whole concept..healthy, flavorful \"fast food\". Grab your reusable cute bento box and go! And such unique flavors that I could never pull off at home. I had the diablo; yummy black beans with a great contrast of pickled onions/jalapeños..Accompanied by an iced coffee from the sister spot, next door, Street coffee. I loved the historic feel of this old house that was completely renovated with the absolute coolest decor. The menu is seasonal and I can't wait to see what's next from this super talented chef!"}
{"text":"If you're downtown, you have to try this place! The food is so fresh and flavorful and the owner is very friendly. There are three items to choose from each day, and they encourage you to taste them all before you order. It is always a tough decision!"}
{"text":"This has to be the cutest place ever! Fresh and savory food that's healthy and delicious. Comes in a cute little Bento Box that can be reused! Its a beautifully renovated little house in Phoenix that's a must see! I was able to taste the winter menu. Missed the summer menu by a week but looks equally as delicious. If your looking for a tasty meal try Tasty Box!"}
{"text":"I come to Tastybox at least twice a week. Not only the food is delicious, their ingredients fresh, and the menu super healthy, but the people who work there are the most loving and caring. I joke with friends that I need my Tastybox fix when having a hard day!"}
{"text":"The food itself was okay. I work near the area and have vowed to explore all the local businesses here, and Tastybox was next on my list. The bento box idea is cute, and the interior of this house converted into a food business is SO adorable (love the decor). However, the food itself was okay. The menus rotate depending on seasons, and I went during the spring and had something with tofu and kimchi. It was alright and for $10, is overpriced, in my opinion. 

I didn't get to meet the owner during my visit, but I'd be willing to come in again and try their summer menu."}
{"text":"I read about Tastybox on yelp and thought I'd give it a try. My husband and I went there today for lunch. It was fabulous! A super cute little house on 7th st. that they converted to a restaurant. Every room a little different. The owners were very upbeat and friendly, greeting you when you enter and offering up samples of their daily specials. All three were delicious. One contained chicken, one was Vegan, and one was vegetarian. I order the vegetarian with chickpeas, roasted eggplant, pitas and fruit. My husband vegan with black beans, marinated onions, jalapino and tortilla strips. They were both wonderful and came in a plastic serving tray to take home."}
{"text":"This is an excellent vegetarian/vegan lunch spot. I was attending a conference in Phoenix and walked in the heat to this place to get some \"real\" food. I was not disappointed. Such a welcome respite from standard conference and business meals. Will be back next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Finally, a place that fills the need for faster food, but doesn't compromise on quality, variety, or taste!  Eating at most quick food restaurants usually makes me feel rotten afterwards. Not here. If you care about your health but are pressed for time, you need this place in your life. Bonus, it's right next to an amazing coffee shop, beans house roasted.  Plenty of parking in back.  Awesome location.  The staff is amazing, really helpful and committed to finding out what your preferences are and accommodating any sensitivities/allergies you might have. So glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"The thai-do-mite was great. It was just like good \"home cooking\". Fast service. Very tasty and fitting to the restaurant name. Try this place before you end up at one of those fast food places."}
{"text":"So here's the deal- This is a restaurant with several pros and cons:

Pros:

The owner is very sweet and helpful
She allows you to sample the food before ordering, which is awesome!
The food is super tasty and the portions are large
The bento box is 10$, not a bad price
They have vegetarian and vegan options
The décor is super cute
You can order the delish coffee from next door from this restaurant


Cons:

They're only open at lunch time during week days which means I can go there approx. 0% of the time (The owner said if I called ahead, she could set aside a box for me to pick up at the coffee shop later (though they also close kinda early))

They only have certain menus on certain days (I've wanted to try their Thai chicken box since they opened and have never been able to get it.... only served on Tues and Thurs and the one Thursday I went to get it.... the owner was on vacation and the restaurant was closed....devastation!!!) 

The food I got (the tofu mushroom dish) wasn't nearly as good the second day as the first BUT I bet the chickpeas or chicken would hold up better.


So in summary, this restaurant is tasty and a pretty good deal with a super nice owner that I would like to support but I simply cannot because I don't work in the area and cannot come during the times they are open. If you are not me and can get to this restaurant when they are actually open, you should, it's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The food is so flavorful it's crazy!! Amazing food options and food options available for anyone basically! Highly recommend this place. The flavor is 100% worth it! I'll"}
{"text":"The owners of tasty box we're so helpful. They have very different options they are all delicious but they give you a sample of all of their options to make sure you get what you want. Delicious"}
{"text":"Love Tastybox!!! Not only is the concept creative, environmentally friendly, and good for the waistline, it's delicious too! And, the waitstaff is so fun and easy to interact with. I can't wait for their new menu to start in July. I'll definitely be back and back and back..."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a tasty bento box lunch at this inviting new community hot spot.  The owner is lovely and the food was flavorful, well portioned, and healthy. Also, happy to see Free Art artwork adorning the walls. What a great concept for lunch. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Such a great concept with food that actually tastes good! All of the options tasted amazing and although I'm not a vegetarian I ended up choosing that option for my meal. Really friendly environment and beautiful aesthetic."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Healthy fast food is their motto and that is exactly what it is...healthy....fast...and DELICIOUS!!!! Perfect place to grab a quick bite with friends or even a place to get some homework done. Love the atmosphere and the friendly employees as well"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today. Got the Southern Comfort, which was absolutely amazing! Seriously impressed with the food quality.

The two employees working were extremely nice. Gave me several samples to try before ordering. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Grand Opening!
Newest spot near the Roosevelt District. Quick, Convenient and most of all Healthy.
Bento Style Lunch Boxes. Meat, Vegetarian & Vegan Options. A little something for everyone!
Friendly Staff, Good Portion, and Bento Box you can Keep!!
