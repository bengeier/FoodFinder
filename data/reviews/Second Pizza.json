{"text":"Are you hungry after a long day working, shopping or maybe studying? I say so because this place is in a shopping mall and adjacent to a college and some big commercial center
If you look for some delicious pizza:
You can grad a slice for a very decent price here and You'll see it is worth the try!
This is a nearby stop by place of mine. When I go shopping and my energy is pretty much drained by long walks in different stores I take a piece here and get ready for a second round of shopping!! 
The bread is thin enough and it is well stuffed and cheesy!
There are plenty of choices. My picks are the mixed the pepperoni and the mushroom"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza. Very busy so it's usually fresh! Lots of variety in slices available."}
{"text":"I can't complain about this place I got exactly what I wanted a cheesy greasy warm slice of heaven. I wouldn't normally have a slice of pizza while at the mall but since I'm going away for a bit I figured I would get my fix.

Two men were working today and they were both making jokes with me if I wanted to take it to go or stay and kept saying for me to make up my mind as I wasn't sure I wanted to waste a paper bag or plate (go green)

Another reason why I liked this place was they didn't just give you a slice from the window and say adios they heated it up in the oven for a few second and handed it to me with a smile."}
{"text":"Best pizza near Dawson hands down. 

It's fast, cheap, tasy, and reliable. Not too greasy or too much crust. Just the right balance of cheese and toppings.

For someone who doesn't really love pizza all that much, this is my favourite. I would have it anytime I'm near by. It's the best.

The bacon is my favourite of their options."}
