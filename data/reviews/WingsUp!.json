{"text":"Had been to the one in Milton a couple years back and they were delicious, so I decided to order from here..bad idea. Complete waste of money. I had ordered honey garlic chicken wings, they were good the first couple bites but when I got under the breading, the chicken itself was very wet and slimy, made me lose my appetite. I had also ordered the butterfly shrimp, also a bad idea.. They were so SALTY, like they've been battered in salt. Had to smother them in ketchup to mask the salt. Very disappointed. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Very tasty wings. The wings were large and they have lots of sauces and sides. I ordered the hot wings and dry Cajun wings for walk-in takeout. The meal was delicious for a reasonable price. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight. It was absolutely terrible. The wings were soggy and just did not taste good at all. I also ordering Thin Skins that were absolutely terrible and did not look like the picture. They're supposed to be fresh kettle cooked potato chips and they were kettle soggy with absolutely next to none of the toppings listed on it. Stop counting your pennies because you're losing your dollars. I'll never be going back."}
{"text":"Finally found \"my place\" to go when I want cheat food! Ordered a delivery and was pleasantly surprised with a female driver! She was really funny and respectful. She had lots of great suggestions for me and my family to use next time! Added a homey touch to the little eatery. The manager Kat was very helpful on the phone with helping pick a sauce for my husband who is very high maintenance haha! 10/10 food and quality service. If I could give 6 stars for the fries I would! DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"These are the best wings I've had in a while. The meat falls off the bone, it's a little crunchy and they're generous with the sauce. 1 lb = 9 wings for nearly $10. Another Yelper mentioned the round carrots and a stick of celery that came with the wings, which I agree is a little strange and totally unnecessary.   They have a few bar style seats, but this is more of a take-out place."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings you'll ever find in the area!  These wings are big, crunchy and juicy....  very pleased with them everytme.  The hot sauce is a sweet style hot... not your regular franks red hot.  Honey garlic or hot are the choices I can't resist.  Try them out... you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"These people know wings. We ordered the three pound crispy wings delivery.  Simply outstanding explosive taste.  Life would have been complete if only they used real blue cheese dip."}
{"text":"they need to watch the times on the dunkers twice over cooked, i can streamline the whole operation but they seem to know better than me so good luck"}
{"text":"I think there should be an option for no stars. I weant yeterday first time. Saw the add for poutine. 8 minutes later. She put it in a bag. With a fork. I take it to my car. I spilled some gravy in my jacket.  I look for napkin in my bag. Nothing. My hands were a mess from eating a skimpy portion if poutine.  Not worth the 3 bux. Will never ever go back. Unless I'm desparate."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse and worse....I previously rated it 5 star but now it's down to 2...I'll definitely be a little hesitant to come back next time.   My last two visits were terrible.   During my second last visit: The staff working there were extremely unprofessional. One girl was on cash completing our transaction and giving us our food, she wasn't quite friendly...didn't seem like she wanted to be there. And you can hear the other girl in the back yelling something, she popped out her head and yelled \"has anyone seen my phone?!?\" Then continued to scramble and throw things around in the back. She came out to the front and she was wearing jeans with a crop top....really? How inappropriate. It looked like she was getting ready to do a delivery and on her way out she yells \"ugh I hate this place!\"  During my most recent visit: We made a large order online and went to pick it up. Everything went well until we got home...one of the things we ordered was 2lbs dry Cajun with fries....we opened it up and there was no seasoning on them at all. And a couple of the others dipping sauces weren't in the correct boxes...it was all over the place.  However when we called they said they could make us a new batch of 2lb wings but we would have to pick up...oh well.   Staff has been changing and honestly it's been pretty shit...might give it one last try but it'll be a \"make it\" or \"break it\""}
{"text":"The counter-person was pleasant when she finally came out from the back room. However, the wings were soggy, flavourless, and overpriced. I frequently go out for wings but the food here stands out as subpar. There isn't much space in the store and when you order your wings are heaped into a pizza box which is a negative. They do have a deal where your drinks are 50 cents which is something I guess. You're much better off going to Wild Wings ,just up the street ."}
{"text":"These wings saved my sanity.  I was working in the plaza today, incredibly worn out by my seventh day working in a row, the second day in a row revisiting my days as a customer service person. One of the WingsUp! guys came in and informed me that it was their grand opening today, and that the first 50 people would receive a 1/2 lb. box of wings for free. Not being able to resist wings OR free stuff, I immediately left my post for some saucy chicken goodness.  I was a little apprehensive, as I've tried WingsUp! in Milton, and it was okay at best. I ordered the Thai flavour (basically the bottled sweet and slightly spicy stuff you can get in Asian grocery stores) and was incredibly pleased with the quality. The breading was crispy, without being overbearing (I'm not a breading person) and the chicken was extremely flavourful. Like I said, the sauce was the bottled stuff, but I was expecting that, and craving it, so I was very happy. The box came with two celery sticks and two giant carrot rounds (not sticks, weird). All my coworkers cashed in on the deal with different flavours and were all super happy about the result.  I will definitely check this location out again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"These are some of the best wings I've ever tasted. The pieces are LARGE. I don't like places that give you pieces full of bones. More importantly, they are cooked to the right texture.   We ordered 5 lbs of wings with 2 flavors. Texas Tequila was good. Tangy Lemon lacked lemon taste but partly because the Texas Tequila overpowered it.   It's only losing one star because I think the prices could be better. They could have offered better prices for larger orders like mine. At a pub $12 is ok for 1lb of wings. At a little shop in the middle or nowhere, $11 for 1lb is a little steep and $50 for 5lbs is not much of a discount. I'd visit again but only if they have a promotion."}
{"text":"I got the thin skins (fresh potato chips with melted cheese, bacon with a side of sour cream) and the wing on a bun.   The wing on a bun was bleh - nothing worth going back for  The thin skins were delicious and amazing! Perfect snack food!"}
{"text":"We've frequented this location since it opened.  Wings were consistently plump and well prepared.  The staff were friendly and gave prompt service--we got to know a few of them because we were regulars.  Visited recently it appears a new franchiser has taken over this location.  The previous staff are gone??? all new people are there.    Our wing order consisted of tiny tiny wings not the previous plump ones.  Service left much to be desired the counter person took a phone call order while we stood st the counter waiting for our order...not very professional.  We are done with this location."}
{"text":"I have to say that my experience at WingsUp was really good.  My order was Honey Hot and BBQ wings with Potato Wedges.  Delicious wings however the price was questionable. Like other reviews state, WingsUp is kind of expensive. You can definitely find better deals elsewhere but if you are in a  rush to feed the babies check this place out. About the shop itself , it is very small but has limited bar seating in case you want to eat in. They have daily sandwich specials too."}
{"text":"Ordered their drumsticks, don't. They were chicken legs. Stick with their expensive wings if you must."}
{"text":"The wings are overall great and tasty in comparison to the other local wing place down the street. My favourites is the spicy honey garlic and the cajun flavour. The only negative about this place is the price of the wings.... almost $35 for two pounds of wings."}
{"text":"Used to be our favourite place to get delivery on a busy night. We would order from this location at least 3-4 times per month as they had a great daily deal on fresh chicken sandwiches. The last few months I've seen some new staff, and customer service has gone way downhill (items being forgotten/incorrect sauces/not friendly on the phone when called to let them know of errors).   Last month, they updated their menu and everything went up by a dollar or two. I understand that changes were necessary, but it was definitely surprising to see the daily special go from $5 to $7.  I decided to place an order online for delivery last Friday. They had added a few new items to the menu, so I ordered the buffalo wrap combo as I noticed that it was the same price as the special (promo--I thought). Order went through as usual. I received a call from the store almost 10 minutes later. The staff member said that it was an error on the website and they would not be honoring the price of my order, as the buffalo wrap for 6.99 was Wednesday's special.  I emailed the WingsUp! head office to explain the situation. The price should have been honored as it was on the online ordering system and the order was completed fine. I have yet to hear back, and sent a follow-up email with still no response. I did notice, though, that the price of the item in question has been changed, so my email has been read. I at least expected an apology, as the owner of the franchise, Darren, seemed to really care about customer service when I talked to him previously.  They have now lost a regular customer of over 10 years due to a small incident and a few dollars. I am not a petty person, but a level of service is to be expected when you are a loyal customer who spends money at a restaurant as frequently as I do. I gave them ample opportunities and time to rectify the situation before updating my review. I had previously rated them 4 stars, but after the last few months, the level of service at this location is worthy of 1 star."}
{"text":"I was very glad to hear there was going to be a location in Mississauga. I have tried the Oakville location many times. Awesome wings! Been a while,so I will return very soon."}
{"text":"I bought wings from this Mississauga location. I had the \"runs\" shortly thereafter. I am worried about the quality of chicken and hand washing here. I won't return."}
{"text":"Prices are straight up insulting.   $14.99 for a lb of wings, the girl says its strictly 8 wings per pound. So 16 wings for more than $32 after tax and they have the nerve to even charge extra AGAIN for asking for lots of sauce  Used to be my favorite place, but the menu prices make me sick now"}
{"text":"Always order ahead as they make everything when ordered. Love the deep fried macaroni."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. I live 5 minutes away, was told it would be here in 45 minutes. It was over an hour until it arrived. My first few bites were pleasant, but then things turned around. I had mac and cheese wedges which were yummy for what they are, and honey garlic wings. WAY too much breading, but even worse, WAY too much sauce that was WAY too sweet. It was so sickly sweet I could barely finish. It actually made me queasy to my stomach there was so much of the sweet honey garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Love the wings here!!! The best.  I love wings and have been to all Wing places in the area.  Way better than turtle jacks. Even though wild wings is down the street, wing up wings are cruncher and better tasting. Must eat!"}
{"text":"Placed an online order earlier today for their two chicken sandwiches for $6.99 deal, a combo upgrade with an upgrade to a large fries and gravy. Even though I placed it online and drove there myself to pick it up, it still took some time. Understandable being how there were only two workers and I saw that one went on a delivery at that time. However, the worker still got my order wrong. Gave me the combo sized fries even though I paid for a large upgrade-- luckily I caught that and told him. I didn't think to check the sandwiches but I should've before I left-- I ordered a Smiley Sandwich and instead got a Wing on a Bun (when you choose Dry Cajun it's pretty plain). The chicken in the Caesar Sandwich was pretty dry.   Disappointed that this is the second time that they have gotten my order wrong and I don't even think that it is worth calling them back to complain. This establishment really needs to provide proper training for rushes so that their workers won't feel overwhelmed and mess up their clientele's orders. Also, they should teach their workers to double check the order receipts.  The only reasons why I gave this place two stars are because even though the wait was way too long, the man behind the counter was polite and the fries were good. I'm at a standstill whether I would come back to eat here seeing how they got my last two orders wrong. It's a shame that I know that the food can be flavorful but the quality of their service affects that."}
{"text":"Amazing wings hands down but they don't give enough portion. I ordered 3 lbs for around $40 with tip and I'm only half full. I don't know if I'd go back but if you plan to try it I recommend Texas Tequila and Thai wings"}
{"text":"So I lived down very close to a Wings Up location in Waterloo when I went to University and over those 4 years these became my go to wings. So crispy, well sauced, and consistently delicious.  I was jazzed to find out that there was a location in Mississauga so I called in last night for delivery because I have a concussion. I only ordered 1 pound of texas tequila and I could tell the guy on the phone was hesitant about sending a driver all that way for 1 pound.  The wings got to my house in 20 minutes flat. They were very very delicious although I will say they could have thrown in an extra 1 or 2....there were only 8 wings and they weren't the biggest I've ever seen. Ended up being nearly $30 for the 1 pound because of delivery....but honestly it was still worth it. These chicken wings are crack.  Overall Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Portions: 3/5"}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be a lot better if the prices weren't so darn high! One regular order of vegetarian \"chicken wings\" are pretty expensive for what you get and they're SUPER greasy as well - I could honestly only stomach about half of what they give you and my stomach was in pain! The box also comes with \"vegetables\" which was two pieces of carrot and two more of a cucumber, as well as some thick fries. Being honest, I've never been a huge fan of chicken wings anyways, but these ones especially I would stay away from, especially considering the price point."}
{"text":"Solid daily sandwich specials and monthly promotions. Always a good option for lunch."}
