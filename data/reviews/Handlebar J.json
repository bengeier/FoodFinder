{"text":"This 5 star review is for Kristen, a server at this bar.  She's aways the life of the party and is clearly the favorite server there.  Customers come there specifically to see her, including me!  She's the sweetest, bubbly, and considerate server.  She will bend over backwards to provide you with a fun experience and I will continue to come to this place as long as she works there!"}
{"text":"This down-to-earth, gritty neighborhood bar/grill should be a destination must-see for Scottsdale.  They will be celebrating their 35th year anniversary in October and there aren't many places that can claim this feat.  Even though I'm not a fan of country music, I must say this place is fun!  The bartenders are spot on and friendly.  The drinks are tasty, but the people watching is the BEST!  The bathroom is a little tiny but workable.  I haven't had a chance to eat there but my friends who have say the food is good.  Check out the bar on Sunday nights (Chris is bartending - awesome bartender!).  The house band is rockin' and it's always busy.  It's a great place to get rid of those Sunday night blues."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE IT!  I first went here with a friend when I was visiting Scottsdale and now that I live here I go here regularly.  The service is great and they always remember you.  I hadnt been there for a year and the guy bartender welcomed me and even remembered my drink (maybe I drink too much) lol.    Ray is a wonderful host and his band is just great.  Sure enough...I went home and looked at the back of my Lyle Lovett CD's and I think he's on each and every one of them!  How cool!  The music is great and if you like to dance country this is the place.  Lots of sweet people here too and if you are looking to meet new friends, Handlebar J is great for that.  Lastly...the food is awesome.  The BBQ is out of this world and even though the pricing isnt great, the quality is.    See you soon new friends.  Thanks for being exactly what I was looking for in AZ."}
{"text":"Super fun!  Live music there last night!  Had a blast and I don't even like country music!  Great wings too...best I've had since moving here to AZ!"}
{"text":"First time at this establishment.  Kudos for the food and service.  Both were very good.  However, the other patrons, which we assumed must be regulars, do not take kindly to newcomers.  On the dance floor, which is quite small, we were consistently bumped into and jostled. The looks we received, definitely made us feel we were not welcomed.  Sorry to say, we will not be back or recommend this establishment for anything more than a good meal."}
{"text":"I'm saying late forties plus. Great for mom and dad who want to swing dance. Not sure if the crowd gets younger later but I'm not sticking around to find out"}
{"text":"This place is just so fun. We went for Tuesday night line dancing lessons and the teacher was wonderful. The food was pretty good- awesome wings. The ambiance is amazing. Best country western bar ever. This is one of my new favorite places in Phoenix and I will definitely return when I come back. Just a really great fun country bar. Check it out for a fun night."}
{"text":"Good Live Country Music - with a good dance floor inside.  Out side, you can listen to the music while ordering drinks at the outside bar on the patio. I thought this was a good setup for the inside can be a bit crowded during the weekend.  I thought the crowd was just fine. One other review was saying the crowd  there were not a bunch of models, yea- that is right, but I don't look like a model either, so that is ok with me. Good wholesome people were here.  Good experience - fun place. This was part of the guy's 3 day weekend activities in Phoenix during the Spring."}
{"text":"Calling this a dance hall is a real stretch.  I would give it one half of a star.     Calling this a good home style restaurant would be spot on! Five stars  We chose this place purely for dancing and boy were we disappointed.  2/3 of the dance floor was covered in tables. Hello manager - remove tables once the band starts. Also the floor was a small triangle with a pole blocking one side.  Extremely crowded floor with no dance etiquette made for a disappointing experience.  More than disappointing but I can't think of a good word now.    However - if you want comfort food and excellent music choose this place. I had the fried chicken with real mashed potatoes and man was it moist and tasty.  My husband had a full rack of ribs and they quickly disappeared. He enjoyed the sauce which was different, with a slight amount of heat and very tender.  The restaurant also had the fish fry and I could see that it was a popular order.  Portions were large and plates were taken away cleaned (empty).  Service was good too and it felt like a family run place. I would suggest they invest in a margarita machine because what they called a margarita was embarrassing, so do skip that order.    I would like to stress that the band was excellent and a real treat.  If I wanted to listen to music and have a good meal I would've been extremely satisfied - but our agenda was dancing and it fell short."}
{"text":"This is a cool place, with a fabulous house band. The food was good, but the pricing left us cold. Last week we split a full rack of ribs, and the server brought us beans and cole slaw instead of potatoes and corn because we're low carb dieters. We were charged the menu prices and were happy.  Last night we returned and did the same, plus the $3.95 house salad that comes with an entree. We were charged $5.95 for the house salad, because the server decided we wanted a larger salad, and $1.50 x 2 for changing the sides because the chef said no subs were allowed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"First timers to Handlebar-J and it was wonderful! We went at an off time so it was dead but the food was still amazing. My husband and I got the grilled artichoke to start, the fish and chips for me and ribs for him. The ribs were so tender he barely pressed into them and the meat melted off the bone. Sharon our server was kind and informative recommending all her favorite items which we accepted gladly. We will be back on a more lively night for dancing!"}
{"text":"Great ribs!  Great live country music and dancing!  Friendly staff!  Really had a good time, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly efficient staff, great country band, delicious food, Jenga, nice outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"best country bar in arizona!!!great live band,good service and amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"After the experience I had at Handlebar-J's on Saturday, January 22, 2011, I will never go back to the place. My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant at approximately 6:30 pm to have dinner. The waitress was going to seat us at a very small high-top in the dining area and because it seem like all the other tables were reserved, I asked if it would be ok if we sat in the bar area. She took us to the bar area and ask if the table facing the dance floor was alright, we said yea it worked for us. All the other tables in the bar area were empty and the table she sat us at had a \"Reserved\" sign on it; we figured this was so they could use the table for dinning customers.  After finishing dinner, the waitress asked if it would be ok if she closed-out our ticket and transferred us over to another waitress. After ordering dessert and another round of drinks, we said sure. The second waitress came over and said they had put one of the drinks on our tab with her. We said ok; she asked if we were going to be staying around for a while and we told her yes, we were going to listen to the band and dance. At this time, there were a few tables still available in the bar area and no one asked us to move. At around 9:15 pm, after we had spent over $100 on dinner, dessert, and drinks, we returned to our table after dancing to find our drinks were gone. The waitress approached us and informed us that they had to move us because the table was reserved and the people were here, but that they would find us another table. Now mind you, at this time the place is packed and there are no tables available. So, we stand there waiting, as we watch the owner give our table to some people she obviously knew, who had a table close to the entrance. We think ok, they're going to seat us in the table these people just vacated (not cool, but we could deal with this). Oh no, instead they take our table and someone else takes theirs as we are left standing.  I was furious! Who treats paying customers that way! I let the waitress know exactly how I felt about what just happen and all she could say was I'm sorry, the first waitress never should have sat you there and the table was reserved for 9:00 pm and the people just showed up, and the owner told us to take the table. THE OWNER TREATS HER CUSTOMER LIKE THIS! At no time between 6:30 and 9:00 pm were we ask to move or informed that we would have to give up our table and we watched the people leave a table to take over our table. We paid our bill and left, and will never return. They didn't even have the decency to comp us for the way they were treating us!"}
{"text":"A great country bar! It's not fancy, but you'll have a great time.... And the spicy mac&cheese prevents most hangovers!"}
{"text":"Now, I'm not a country western fan, have never line-danced or danced the 2-step.  But this is a great bar.  I was talked into going by my son, who is a country western fan.  The first time I went there, we just had something to eat, and beer.  The band hadn't started playing, because we were there to early, but the people were nice, and all the staff were really pleasant. We only had hamburgers, so we couldn't really judge the food.  The next time I went, my golfing buddies wanted to try it - so we got there on a Friday night, right before the band started..  Now none of us are country western guys, so we were there just to have a good time. One of the guys wandered off and found a TV, which the staff switched onto a football game he wanted to see. The rest of us sat and watched as the band started playing, and the dancers started dancing.   What a great time!!  Obviously, there was a group of people that were regulars, and came just to dance.  Then there were a lot of people (like us) that just came to watch, drink, and have a good time.  There is a whole range of age groups, and everyone seemed to be having a lot of fun, whether they were dancing, drinking or watching.  Out of all the places I took my buddies, this is the one place that they all said they wanted to come back to. And who knows, maybe next time they will bring cowboy hats!!"}
{"text":"I love Handlebar-J!  The location, environment, music, staff and food are terrific!  Gwen welcomes you at the door and makes you feel as if you are the guests of honor! She does this with the warmth & grace  of a queen.  Whether you are enjoying a dining table or relaxing at the bar with the friendly staff, or enjoying the open comfortable patio, all are winners. I  am happy.  All  set to the musical landscape of the Herndon Brothers Band.  They are fabulous!  Dancing is fun, too, even if you have two left feet like me. Drinks are great and very reasonably priced.  I brought family and friends Friday night & they loved it (and they're tough to please!)  Highlight of our night was listening to Ray Herndon sing!  He still sounds great with the best voice in country music.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The server was great BUT the music and the band was awful.  We went expecting country music and what did we get....crap blues.  We had two beers and left.  Couldn't stand the music.  The server was great, however.  The band needed to see the audience.  The only ones dancing were the same three couples.  Look around at the rest of the audience and see that they are NOT enjoying your music.  Play to your audience NOT what you like."}
{"text":"fun cowboy bar.  line dancing nites. unique place to bring out-of-town visitors. casual"}
{"text":"I met one of my closest friends here 5 yrs ago, it used to be friendly and customer service oriented...NOT ANYMORE. They just lost (2) customers the other night and my friend was a regular there! What happened? I went to use my debit card for the margarita I had and the bartender told me $10.00 minimum. First of all, in all the time I've went there, the 3 previous bartenders never had a problem with this, 2nd of all, its not posted anywhere out on the patio bar where I sit. I explained this to her and said I don't want another drink, I work tomorrow. I just came to have one with my friend and chat with him. The bartender, Denise,  said I'm sorry, the owner yells at me if its less than $10,00. I asked, Gwen yells at you? She said yes. I said thats to bad,  then I won't come here anymore. I don't carry cash, its safer and I refuse to get drunk on a Sunday night. I never complained when they quit making a regular size margarita and instead started making them in a little brandy sifter glass AND the bartender always got their $2.00 tip from me for that bite-sized drink. Do the math...$7.00 for mini-margarita, $2.00 for tip is $9.00,  BUT DOOR #3 has friend that spends over $100.00 month there which=really dumb and cheap to not cover 20-30 cents because I use a debit card! We'll be going next door to catch up and have a few laughs. Not only does the owner there (Greg) not have a minimum amount to use your card...he occasionally buys me a drink!!!                                                                     YOU WON'T GET THAT AT HANDLEBAR-J!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  I have been there twice now and have had the ribs.  First time without sauce, sauce in the side.  They were slightly crispy on the outside and tender, perfectly fall off the bone meat.  Second time with sauce, great with a little kick.   Spouse had a burger which was great as well.  Staff was very friendly and attentive. We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for dinner and dancing when I'm in Scottsdale! Great service, food and staff! Go see them!"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely repulsed. We waited for 5 minutes while a hostess helped two elderly ladies find a table, then myself and 4 friends tried to enter at 6:30PM and they wanted to charge each of us a $5 cover for Dinner after we even called ahead to make sure there were seats available for 5 and they never mentioned a cover. We just saw the old ladies before us sit down and not pay any cover.   Anywhere that tries to charge people a cover for dinner is pathetic, the place was empty and there wasn't even any entertainment playing. The hostess couldn't even explain why there was a cover."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight here, what a treat. Friendly and efficient service. We ordered onion rings, fish fry and I had a half order of ribs.  I got a glass of wine, once that was served the waitress brought out delicious home made corn bread biscuits. Yum. Our rings came out shorty followed by our meal. Rings were wonderful, lightly battered and tasty. My husband really enjoyed the fish fry; 4 pieces of fish, loads of fries and coleslaw. My ribs came with a choice if 2 sides. I had corn on the cob and coleslaw. At 6 pm, the band began to play. Although I am not a C/W fan, the band was quite good. Great dinner experience. Ambience of course was country western."}
{"text":"This place was hopping.....mostly regulars....half dance and half pick up joint.  If you want to go out and people watch, you'll love it.  I'd highly suggest that you not eat here.  We ordered BBQ ribs......over an hour later they came out so tough that I literally could not get one bone out....I sent them back and ordered something quick....chicken fingers....they were so overbreaded and overcooked....I couldn't believe it.  I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh Handlebar J's where have you been all my life? This place is very authentic- real country, very unique. There's not a lot of places like this in Scottsdale. Good live music, there's a lot of two stepping going on. It's very warm and friendly, and humble yet it's nicer than a dive.  So we got here Friday at midnight, and were very warmly greeted. It was late,  yet they still served us food. (it's no 4 star dining so don't expect a fancy menu). I just loved our waitress who was very down to earth, funny & very attentive."}
{"text":"Took advantage of the \"Fish Fry\"...this was an amazing delight! Staff were all smiling and friendly. Nice relaxing and comfortable vibe inside. Did f have time to dive in, but will be back in with my family sometime.  As I was sitting waiting for my food. I was greeted by a few employees. Upon my food's arrival, I was asked I wanted enjoy the food inside for a bit. Thy was nice gesture and personable. Sandi, I believe her name...so welcoming and inviting.   The food was terrific and a perfect portion.   Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It has a great environment with awesome  music and even better food!"}
{"text":"We were in the area on a Friday night around 7:30pm & heard the live music. We decided to try it out for drinks&dinner. First, the hostess asked for a cover charge $15/person..huh, just to have dinner? Then, she changed it to $15 for both of us...well, we  were hungry so let's stay.  We waited for another hostess to seat us...after 10 minutes, they asked if we wanted to sit outside? We said sure!  They pointed to a table for 2 that was clean & open.  Again, we waited for another 5min...she found menus to seat us.  Yikes, we realized if seating took this long, the service must be unbelievably slow.  So we opted to leave! Glad they returned our money.  We found an amazing restaurant across the street..so all went well! The next day I read the reviews...I can relate to the other disappointed guests.  I gave 2 stars bcuz of service and I hope they remove the $15 cover charge for dinner guests..or add $15 to the tab to cover live music (with notice)."}
{"text":"We are BIG fans!!!  Love this place! We went for the free dance lessons last week and are going again this week! Great live music 7 nights a week! Good service - though a bit confusing....   even if you have a tab at the bar - order from the waitresses that come around - you don't have to keep going back to the bar to place your order.  The waitresses are there to take care of you and that's what they do.  Aslo, because of the live music and dance lessons, etc. there is a  2 drink minimum to be prepared to have and pay for something.  But with music, food and service this good that shouldn't be a problem!  We also want to try the steak and enchaladas....  not sure if we're going to or not - but it's on our list of things to try!!!  We'll go back every time we are in Mesa/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We loved the outdoor patio!  Beautiful tables and outdoor lighting.  Helpful, friendly staff!  Great food!!  Great dancing music/live band on a Saturday night!  Only thing they might want to add to their bar would be blended ice drinks."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with our experience here. We came in hoping to enjoy the music and a few drinks on a Saturday night and we will probably never come back. The lady taking money at the gate was about the most unwelcoming individual I have ever encountered. I don't mind paying a cover when the music is good but the band took 45 minute breaks and just never returned from the last \"break\".  We had a hefty tab for the few drinks we had and I wondered if the folks eating dinner paid a cover as well. At one point we heard a waitress tell the bartender she was wasted, and when my other half went to use the restroom the door was slammed in his face and he was told by the 5 idiots inside to take a hike. (have no clue what they were doing) There was someone in the office in the same hallway that didn't do anything about it because he was clearly distracted by the intoxicated woman that pushed her way into the office with him and closed the door. I had been here before and really had a great time, now it seems like a total dump. Sad. We will never waste money here again and I would suggest almost anywhere else if you are thinking about it."}
{"text":"This is a Scottsdale staple. Has been here forever. Food and service is always really good and there is always live music. The house band, The Herndon Brothers have been playing there for as long as I can remember and are always on point. 2 things that keep me from giving 5 stars.  1. This is probably one of the only places I've seen In a very long time that still charges a cover.  2. Double check your tab before you close out, sometimes the servers will tip themselves 20% automatically and not tell you so you end up tipping more. Even when you're not with a big group. Other than that we will continue to frequent Handlebar -J. It's a great spot."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place before and was eager to check it out with some out of town guest. There was total of 8 of us and made reservation for Sunday night. Place was not packed and realized we had more people to come than original 8. Party grew to 18 and Tony our server was more than accommodating. Sat outside. Tony's first introduction was \"I hope you all are on one check so it will be less complicated\". Really? Is that the right attitude? It's not that hard to split everyone's checks. Waited 45 minutes for drinks (came with some missing) order was incorrect on 5 different plates and at the end he had to split it anyways because he said it probably would be better. Food was delicious minus the wrong orders, band was great but service kinda sucked. Bummer..."}
{"text":"What a great bar!  I have spent many an evening here drinking their inexpensive beer while watching drunk people dance.  This is not the \"pretty people\" bar, this has the feel of a neighborhood bar.  Everyone is mostly friendly and I've never seen the place packed to the gills.  The decor is sorta old west, meets Hawaii.  Very strange.  On occasion they have cool theme parties (cool because of the FREE food) on the weekend.  I didn't see any happy hour specials the last time I was there but I didn't look.  There is easy access to the 101, but don't drive drunk, Snobsdale cops will catch you.  This place has a lot of regulars, but after a few visits you could fit right in."}
{"text":"The food is good but they have it so dark in the main dinning room.  The chairs are cheap plastic and not very sturdy. You can not see the food when they bring it out. There were  people using there phones just to read  the menu. Staff  is nice. We have been going there off and on since 1970."}
{"text":"I have been going to Handlebar J's for about 15 years. I have got to know Ray Herndon and the family pretty well over the years.  I took a look at the other reviews. First, I got to say, if you are expecting this place to be some hip \"Snottsdale\" hang-out, you will be disappointed!  Its a country bar/eatery. I have always loved the band, and the music they play. But thats what this is. You come here to drink, dance and maybe eat a little.  The food is what you expect, its good but its not Maestros, and nor do they care.  Yes, Mama can be a little tough, but hey, its her place and her rules.  They do have a two drink requirement. I think thats fair. I have seen people show up, order a drink, and spend the night nursing it. Seriously! You gotta be prepared to pay for the place, the music and the atmosphere, and two drinks is nothing!  As for the tables, they have a right to expect people sitting at tables to either drink, eat or stand up! This is not your home barbecue!  Finally, if you are in the forties plus, this is a great place for pickups. No, its not for twenty somethings, and again, its a country saloon.   I dont dance worth a damm, but there is often the \"barfly\" resident cowboy that is able to dance, just waiting for the girls to come in. Not my thing, but people love it.  This place is a part of the Scottdale heritage! Heck, I am told back twenty years people rode their horses up to the bar. I even heard a friend rode hers INTO the bar.  Enjoy it and say hi to Ray!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fun music, good people-watching, and reasonable beer prices."}
{"text":"A friend who lives in the area invited us out for drinks. This is country all the way. The outdoor patio is pretty large the bar is decent size. They had the place decorated cowboy. Hats and boots all over. They had a band playing and they were pretty good, from old country to current it was working as the dance floor was full. The crowd here is older and interesting but people watching is fun.  Not much line dancing going on , its all about the 2 step here. Decent place good time and beer. Food looked good but did not try any. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"I've never done this before (yelped)  but was so irritated I had too. I went to this place with my boyfriend Saturday night. We were charged to get in which pissed me off since all the bars around don't charge and have either live music or entertainment of some sort. Then once I get in the domestic beers where expensive. Once we got in I thought maybe I was visiting my gma at her assistant living facility. I have to say I do love \"more Mature\" people But really? I would say the average age was 60-70. The band was good but I live in Cave Creek.  We have country bands and its FREE! Then the beer prices, really? Umm not worth the drive at all. I'f they stopped charging MAYBE we would go back. We were in line with 2 other young girls and I'm pretty sure hot and young bring lots of people. They need to get a clue and the 70+ year old door lady takin money well not the friendliest. The lady bartender was the best thing there! We went to Dirty Dog and spent our money there. Peace out and good luck with that."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go to Handlebar J for a bite and some dancing.  I would never eat there again.  Our waitress admitted it was her first night serving after a couple questions about what beer was on tap.  We appreciated her honesty.  But it was all down hill from there.  It took more than an hour to get our dinner, the second round of drinks we ordered took more than 35 minutes. Finally when we asked what the heck was going on we were told our waitress had left... note to management train staff on non busy nights and suggest your servers know your menu before serving.  The final slap in the face was when the bill came and we were charged the regular price for the special of the day Ribs.. wtf you make me wait over an hour for mediocre  food, and then overcharge me? Not a place I'd go back to and eat EVER again and I'd suggest you eat somewhere else and THEN come to dance. And oh yeah, did I mention the $5 cover to come in and eat dinner?  Who charges a $5 cover to have crappy food and poor service? I won't again"}
{"text":"I was up there last week with a group of friends and volunteered to be the designated driver for the night. It was a $5 cover to hear the house band, which was no biggy and then I asked for a diet coke which was another $3. Again, no problem paying for the diet coke. After about 30 minutes and some dancing, I went up to the bar for a refill of the diet coke expecting the refill to be free. The bartender told me it would be another $3. I mentioned that I was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that I thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible. Well that got me nowhere so I asked for a glass of water instead. I was told that the bartender couldn't give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water.  Now it's July in AZ and I had been dancing. We had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who can't give me a glass of WATER. Really? I don't mind paying the cover and the cost of the first diet coke, Im not being cheap but the point is that most bars appreciate and take care of the designated driver. I was being responsible and they couldn't even give me a glass of water!  Really?"}
{"text":"Super authentic \"Western\" bar/BBQ joint in Scottsdale. Absolutely FANTASTIC FOOD and ambience.   Never ever had better BBQ. A must when in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Many in Scottsdale like to celebrate the early western days.  This is such a place.   We went on a Friday and there was live music on the patio starting at 4:30.  Inside, live music they said starts at 8:30; however, we left prior to that. There were many families there as well as a couple dancing on the small dance floor.  The servers wears 6 shooter pistol holders and I've no idea what they keep inside them! There is great people watching.  The staff move fast and our food came fast as well. Tip: make a reservation early in the day- These guys get busy Tip: parking- It is a challenge.  On the north side in an alley is a great area for parking; otherwise street parking is available and you may have to \"hoof\" it to the place."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and like country music go to handlebar J's. The barbecue is excellent. Great ribs and great bbq chicken.  They have live music most nights and free dance lessons on Wednesday."}
{"text":"I love this iconic Old Scottsdale tavern!  It's a great place for lunch and a casual supper. Great patio, and the service is friendly and as fast as possible. It's a popular place, so if you're in a hurry, make a reservation. The menu is just plain good food. Everything is fresh and deliciously seasoned. Nights can get a little wild if country dance and music is too scary for you, but the brave will find a treasure of a fantastic, unpretentious restaurant that genuinely cares about customer service."}
{"text":"This would be a great place if the clientele was different. Staff is great, atmosphere is very good, but patrons were old and uptight. Each couple gave the look that only they should be entitled to the dance floor. Try Harold's in Cave Creek or Denim and Diamonds for fun country dancing!"}
{"text":"Just one of my favorite places!  Everyone is so nice!   Band amazing!  Have not been for awhile but have been going there for years! Love Handlebar J!!"}
{"text":"Western style place that captures a cowboy atmosphere. There's a lot of outdoor seating and a good happy hour food menu.  I got the riblets for happy hour. They were very good, especially at that price. Meat falls off the bones. It's a wet style rib.   We then did a line dancing class for $5. Class was quite popular/crowded and somewhat advanced. Attracts an older crowd. Overall a fun place."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and really had a good time. It's a very older crowd, I would say the average age was above 40. The band did a good job and I had a lot of fun dancing. There was a $5 cover, which is typical for most places. The dance floor was kinda small and kept getting crowded, but it was good enough. The fire pit outside was great and a nice treat on a cool November evening. The drinks were about 5.50 a beer and food seemed reasonable priced. I didn't have anything to eat, but I'll have to comeback and try it."}
{"text":"A great date spot, with seemingly terrific menu but the owner or singer whoever he is; I think his name was Ray... somewhat came off as a creeper kept interrupting my dinner to hit on my sister. Made her feel uncomfortable.. Tab please?!"}
{"text":"This is my go to neighborhood bar. Everyone is super chill. And the food is solid! Megan is the best!(One day  I will get her on the dance floor) Every beer she serves is like God's tears in your mouth! Ron is like Billy Joel on steroids! The whole staff rocks! Yeeehaaaw! (Picture me riding of on a donkey shooting pistols off into the sunset!) Handle bar J'S a local Gem worth the time checking out."}
{"text":"The band was good. Only wished I knew how to dance to country! Service was good! we will be back! After a few more dance classes"}
{"text":"Had a great time celebrating my birthday at Handlebar J!! Can't wait wait for next year! Wish the dance floor was bigger, band was awesome that night!!"}
{"text":"This authentic honky tonk in Scottsdale called HANDLEBAR J was awesome!!  They had a legit band playing on a Friday night, and I'm not even a huge country music fan. But what made this place was their delicious food. We started with their jalapeño poppers, and they were as good as it gets! I then had the ribs and chicken combo and those were fantastic! The ribs fell off the bone, and the chicken was soft and flavorful. I also had two big potato spears and corn on the cobb. I also had a couple Ranger IPAs, two Cadillac margs, and four shots of Fireball. So all in all it was a good night.  I'll be back! 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great country bar! I went on a Wednesday evening and arrived to see the ending of dance lessons. The house band was phenomenal! I danced like there was no tomorrow! I couldn't move the next morning!!! The place get crowded fairly quickly...old and young alike.  Everyone was jolly!  Outdoor seating is available and it's very spacious! I did not eat on this visit, but I did get a $4.30 bottle of Handlebar J's water. :-)  I will return again when I can eat and drink!"}
{"text":"We came in here around 8:45 PM on a Wednesday night because we were in the area and starving! All that we were looking for was food, but to our surprise, Handlebar-J was hopping! Apparently they had a live band, hence the $5 cover per person {I have not paid a cover charge in YEARS!!!}. We were are little taken back by the cover charge because we were literally there to eat dinner, not two-step the night away to the live band. But, we were starving and didn't want fast food, so we paid it.   When we arrived, we told them that two of us were eating dinner and the other two were just going to have drinks. They almost didn't even seat us in the {pretty empty} dining room because all four of us weren't eating? Huh? It was so odd! They did end up seating us there and we ordered right away.   My review would probably be two stars because of the hassle at the beginning but our server was very attentive and didn't miss a beat! We ordered a cheese crisp to split and I ordered a caesar salad with chicken for my entree. The cheese crisp had a little too much cheese on it {if that is possible} but it was decent. The salad was good, but not worth $10.50 {more than my friend's sliders and fries!!!}. I found it interesting that their salads were more expensive than much heartier dishes on their menu. Oh well! All in all, the food was just ok. For 4 beers, 2 entrees, and 2 appetizers, we spent a total of $92 including tip and cover charge. Yikes!   All in all, I probably won't come back BUT if you are into country music and dancing, this would 100% be your place. Everyone on the dance floor looked like they were having a blast.  P.S. I didn't post pics because it was super dark inside which equals bad foodie photos. {I'm a perfectionist!}"}
{"text":"It was our first visit to Handlbar J's , we had a great time on Saturday night.  The band was rockin', the ribs were great, service was excellent.  It's a fun way to spend an evening.  Special shout out to Yvonne who was the hostess with the mostess, took the time to explain the history of the restaurant, introduced us to Sandy and Ron and gave us some insider tips on when to come for music, dance lessons and food specials.  Thank you Yvonne, you made our night!"}
{"text":"The  service was terrible. It wasn't busy and it took over 30 minutes to get my drink and my friend never did get hers."}
{"text":"Great food, Fun atmosphere and a place that will never disappoint with live entertainment. Highly recommended for someone traveling in from out of town to do while you're in the area! Local favorite spot for country dancing and drinks."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere and good service. Live music both on the patio during dinner and then in the bar for dancing at night! Both bands were great too!"}
{"text":"The food and music were fantastic. The Band was cool and played requests from the crowd. Never a dull moment after 10:00pm."}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix/Scottsdale a lot.  Handlebar J has become my hangout because the waitresses are nice and although the food is ok, the band is awesome and sometimes my sister or I even get asked to dance.  It's  a real honky tonk and not some cookie-cutter joint.  The owners seem nice and unlike the Rusty Spur (aka nasty management), there are no pretenses and there's lots of room for dancing, drinking and fun."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and wanted to go to the Toby Keith bar and grill but ended up at Handle bar J's,  boy was that a mistake. We went in and found a table for four and ordered our drinks hadn't even finished the first drink and here comes our dumpy little waitress, shes says order up or loose your table, now mind you we have been there all of maybe a half hour, I was like really your going to force me to drink, she said read the sign your at a premium table order up or get out. We asked to talk to the manager who happened to be the owner and she was the same way. As a business owner myself and having worked in the hospitality industry for years I  can tell you customer service can make or break a business.  My recommendation would be to skip Handle bar j's the were beyond rude."}
{"text":"I have been going to Handle Bar Jay 3 years. On Wednesday Friday and some Saturday and Bar Tender L J customer service is outstanding  100% very Caring 100% and always on top of everything he treats His Customers 100%   Overal I give LJay more 100% 200%"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to be so friendly here!  If you like country music....and a  no frills FUN time....this is the place! I have often visited Handlebar J's over the years and it has never changed - its the last of the country bars down this way. Whether its the LIVE band or not - you will see the cowboy hats on the dance floor twirling about.....And if you are looking to learn how to 2-step....you are in luck - they host lessons on Wed nights!! A great casual atmosphere on the patio lends to conversation without screaming. Everyone here seems to be so friendly too! Handlebar J's - a country landmark."}
{"text":"I set up a time to meet here with a group of 4 at 5pm on a Friday night. Not knowing the menu since its not posted, we were going to have some drinks and food, check it out. So we thought. My friend arrived first saud the hostess REFUSED to seat us....what?  They were too busy or something, I didn't understand. I went in after tried to get seated, the  not accommodating hostess would not seat us outside at certain areas  unless we were sure we were ordering dinner...how could I without seeing a menu? Uh....rude....she had too many questions about what I was to drink and eat, so I said no thanks, walked out, took my friends next door to the pizza place. Will not return to this place. Ever. 1st time walked out of a place in Scottsdale. And you wonder why people call it Snobbsdale. Well...there you go.."}
{"text":"Holy amazing fun! We come here because we live about 5 minutes down the road. I can't tell you how awesome it is to have something so unpretentious around the corner. I will say there was a feisty old lady in the bathroom who didn't appreciate my joke about the breast implant advertisement in the stall ha! Owellllll. Can't win em all! The band was top notch. I should also mention if you tell yourself \"I'm not going to drink so many shots I'm going to end up at jack in the box!\" You are lying to yourself. I know I love me some jalapeño poppers while drunk."}
{"text":"I would argue that HBJ is the best country bar/restaurant experience here in the valley. Unlike other country bars, HBJ is an experience in and of itself- from the live music every night, the crowd, the food, to even the venue itself. The environment is interactive, engaging, inviting, and seriously fun! I can tell that the owners are actively involved and constantly seeking out new ways to improve their venue. In order to deliver the greatest quality experience for those who come to visit. The music is fantastic-  every night I've been there feels like I'm at a country concert. Not to mention- the food is awesome (personally not much of a foodie, but I can def say the food here is tasty). The more \"foodie\" types I go with Always rave about the ***ribs, burgers, and potato skins- 5 stars*** Plus, the place is just SO MUCH FUN. Anyone who likes country music, or enjoys going out and having fun, should definitely go & experience this place-  for sure."}
{"text":"The two stars is strictly based on the food.  From what I can tell, the place is focused on the country-bar aspect rather than the food.  It seems like a popular place in the evenings, with live music and dancing, and gets pretty crowded.  However, I went for lunch, and got the barbecue beef sandwich.  Kind of disappointing that a cowboy place wouldn't have decent barbecue.  This seemed eerily similar to the Lloyds barbecue beef that you get at the grocery store, except maybe not as rich - I'm not saying Lloyds is bad, it's just not restaurant quality.  From 11:30-12:00, there were only three customers including myself, which tells me that this is definitely not a lunch place.  So if you're considering going to hang out at the bar or do some line dancing, I'm sure the rest of the reviewers here will steer you right."}
{"text":"Live country music, western decor, fabulous cowboy fare (steaks, potatoes & BBQ ribs) and a 44-year history make Handlebar J's Restaurant & Bar a local favorite.  Sidle up to the bar inside our out; the large outdoor patio welcomes both smokers and non-smokers alike.  Don your Wranglers, your Stetson and your favorite cowboy boots and you'll fit right in.  Located on the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Shea Boulevard, Handlebar J's features live music seven days a week.  Wednesdays through Sundays the local group, the Herndon Brothers Band, starts playing at 8:30pm.  Beginning at 7pm on Sundays, Wednesdays & Thursdays you'll find free dance lessons and Monday nights it's $5 a person for country line dancing lessons.  Ten of us went on a Saturday night and we had a blast dancing inside and drinking outside on the patio.  The music was loud and rowdy and the band was fantastic.  Perfect place to play cowboy & cowgirl!  The restaurant serves both lunch and dinner and hosts a happy hour 3p-6p Monday through Friday.  For a taste of Arizona's western style, check out Handlebar J's."}
{"text":"Terrible food, ribs were so dry, tasted like burnt sticks.  Music so loud you can't even have a conversation.   Maybe drinking and dancing but that's about it!"}
{"text":"I gave it one star because it gave us a good laugh this morning and we did meet some fun folks... but I don't give a rat's a** if all the locals aka cowboys like this place... I don't.  I don't need bartenders with unecessary attitude. Then there's the manager aka the only reason I'm the lead singer in the band is because I'm the manager.  Don't dare wear one of the cowboy hats hanging from the ceiling or you will be in some serious cow pucky!   Guess they're not accustomed to patrons who like to be treated politely.  Definitely not a southern cowboys bar.  The cowboys in Texas know how to treat a lady!  Southern Belle's... steer clear!"}
{"text":"As a follow-up to the response from HBJ management I wanted to clarify that your owner did in fact sit with me to explain that the cook/chef was swamped and that \"she would cook it herself\".  To clarify my review again,,it was the quality of the steak that was sub-par. Both steaks they delivered were thin and full of grizzle,,very hard to eat. I couldn't eat either of them.  At $29 I would expect a better cut, especially since the menu advertises it as your best steak.  I am not that hard to please and have been around the Scottsdale restaurant circuit since the mid 70's. Too many good alternatives for steak in the immediate area to warrant trying this again. I do love the ambiance and the history of your bar but you have to serve a good meal and not dwell on how long you have been there.  This is positive criticism to help you with your next customer.  I don't appreciate the statement that I am the kind of customer that is never happy. When a meal is good I am very happy to report that, when its not this is what Yelp is about."}
{"text":"Herndon brothers weren't playing. Loud rock band. The fried chicken was full price. French fries not good. The fish tacos very fishy. But I still come when the brothers are there. Country music  is my thing"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Jojo and Greg were awesome!!! I was kind of in a bad mood and acted a little irritated... but instead if reciprocating, they took really good care of us! Thanks guys, we love you!"}
{"text":"I hate this place. I feel like everyone here is party of wanna be redneck clique....   Never again"}
{"text":"Prices excellent, food excellent (ribs), service perfect.  A hidden treasure."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, my friends and I feel like we are completely unwelcome here. The bartender was a complete asshole because I asked what kind of TEQUILA they had. He scoffed at me and rolled his eyes. We came here on Friday night at 12:30am and the sign says food is served until 1:30am. They denied us food and were very rude about it as well. If you are not a regular, don't bother coming here. They treat you like dirt."}
{"text":"Come usually after work with friends on weekends! we love the live band while enjoying a cold one with not your average bar food. The food is amazing here and the kitchen is open late! Nice country bar and always a good time, everytime. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.  Moved here from California and can't say enough how great it is to find an establishment that is distinctly, uniquely American and makes no apology for that. Band is great!  Talented musicians that work hard every single night to make people happy. Food is great and very reasonably priced.  Just like mom used to make. (Ok, maybe a little better) Venue is small so no, you can't sit there all night and drink water without being asked to free the table up for others. You're always welcome at the bar however. This is a family run business and I say hallelujah for that. Seems like they remember us every time we call for a reservation even though we only come about once per month.  Thanks Handlebar J's!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in AZ 11 years and never been here. Great ribs, atmosphere and service. It was the first time i got motivated by one of those sign spinners that stand on the corner to advertise a place. It worked and as Arnold would say\"I\"ll be back\" :)"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the WORST experiences I've had at a restaurant from start to finish. The hostess chased us to the table after having paid the cover fee because she thought we hadn't paid, and she didn't even apologize after realizing that we did pay. The waitress rushed us the entire time to the point that she grabbed the check out of our hands.  All that, and the food was mediocre AT BEST. The only thing that was of any consolation was the music. Harold's was much better and such a shame that it shut down. All in all to say-save your money and your dignity and go elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised the food here was that good.  The Fish & Fry was very fresh tasting Alaskan Cod with really good fries.  5-stars.  I normally don't eat fries but the fries here are really good.  Huge portion for $12.  Not likely to be finished by one person.  I also tried the $5 Rib Sampler Lunch Special.  The bbq sauce is very good and tasty.  The meat itself was overcooked and small.  Three ribs cub in half but very tasty.  4-stars.  Update 06/27/2017:  We tried the 2 cheese enchiladas during happy hour for $5.  It was out of this world insane good.  It went down really good with cold draft beer on this blazing summer.  I can't believe the food here is that good.  Nachos Dip was gross.  Nasty tasting.  (Fried) fish tacos were 3.5.  Decent taste.  Fish was mostly batter and only a tiny amount of fish."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in after reading about their live band on week nights. We were really excited to practice some of our dancing we'd been learning. Dance lessons were taking place when we got there so we had a few drinks and waited for the music to start. When it came time to hit the dance floor we were surprised that we were the only ones swinging, everyone was two stepping. That is perfectly fine I just wish it were mentioned somewhere that it is a traditional dance floor so we weren't glared off the floor. :/ the band was great, though!"}
{"text":"Having been here on and off for the past 10 yrs or so last nights experience was beyond poor. Having booked a table I. The dinning room for 7pm and looking forward to an evening of good music and food we were surprised to be charged a cover charge to enter. This seems a bit much when going for dinner. We must have arrived earlier in the past. We sat at our table and it took a full 30 mins for our server to take drink orders. We ordered food when she bought the drinks. It took a trip to the bar as she never returned to us and an hour and a half before I asked at the bar if they might check on our order. The manager bought our salads at ppm. One bite of the Cesar salad and we knew this was not good. I love garlic but as much as was in those would make you ill. Mouth burn in g from the one bite, I requested to see the manager. Her assured us he would remove the salad from the bill. That they were short staffed and was non apologetic. I asked him to cancel the rest of our order as after more than 2 hours we had not eaten and would leave and find some where else for dinner. He kind of shrugged and walked away. Probably won't return. Shame. Also the new menu sucks. Poor choices. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Sad day indeed."}
{"text":"Don't really go to these types of bars a lot (a handful of times), but this was a very enjoyable evening.  Don't line dance, but my wife got out there and kicked up her heels a bit.  The food is good, the atmosphere friendly, and the crowd was great.  If you are into C&W, this is very good place to go."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday night for comedy night. Initially, I was put off when one of the people in my party was charged $5 for bottled (Nestle) water.  The drink special for the night was $3.00 beers, which is a great deal, but that initial dagger was hard to remove.  There is also a two-drink minimum, which may bother some folks so be forewarned. The comedy night was enjoyable, the service was swift - bordering on overbearing, and the final negative of the night was when they said they would not accept charges under $10. Some highs, some lows and some laughs. Overall, not a bad night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving ribs late one night and we came across Handlebar-J. We got take-out and the food was AWESOME!!! We got the ribs and it was top notch. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"3.5  I am a fan of the place, the food the music but man there server was a slug.   We had called for a table while we were driving over. We arrived and there was only 4 chairs for 6 of us. Someone asked if we were the call in (which took 5 min and 2 separate people to confirm we could call in) and I said yes. She walked away. Someone else came over to confirm, I said yes... she walked away. I took it upon myself to find seat for the rest of us.   The drink orders were next, we each ordered but she forgot to bring a water. The food was ordered and we asked for the missing and a refill of an empty water. We got the new one but no refill.   Food was ordered as well as some refills, we got half the refills and no water. I swear every time she came by we needed a drink (only because she forgot the previous time)  The food was good. I had fish, I was hoping for better flavor. It was just good. The salad was good, nothing special. The chicken sandwich and bbq chicken were both good. The apple chimi dessert looked awesome and huge.   The price was ok, the music was good.   The service... oh the service...."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed....I've been going to HBJ for nearly 40 years.  Great place!  However, things are changing drastically.  8 people for dinner, 5 fish specials.  Someone asked for an extra tartar sauce.  What a mistake!   Extra charge for extra tartar sauce? Now they want $25 a head....even if you have dinner.  And a max of 2 hours per table.  Is greed setting in at HBJ?  Maybe things will change when the snowbirds leave and we show up in the summer when few do?    It's changed from a great country bar to a \"live music venue\".  And up go the prices, down goes the fun."}
{"text":"The most fun, unpretentious, good time watering hole I've been to since I've moved into the area. I'm an unapologetic San Francisco girl. I know fine dining and upscale blah blah blah.... but I love a down to earth, real vibe and I found it here. Super nice crowd and our server Gretchen was the best. Hey girl... Can I get a side of fries with that super blonde curvy shake?!? Loved partner dancing and the riblettes appetizer.  Good time for sure. I will be back."}
{"text":"Me my wife and my son stopped in on a Friday evening for dinner had to pay a cover charge, I get it band was playing. The food was not that great steaks and ribs tasted like yesterdays leftovers. The drinks OMG a margarita came in a brandy glass $20.00ea Domestic beer $7.00, Vodka Tonic not the top shelf $14.00. The waiter had the personality of an ant had to go to the bar to get drinks refilled, done with dinner we had to put out plates on a empty table along with others. The only good part was the band and the bar tender were good. For $300.00+ never again. Don't waste your money on greed."}
{"text":"It's definitely a place to dance and to make hookups. The dance floor is rather small but it is a good quality wood floor for a country place. There were a few real dancers when I was there but plenty of people that just danced because they liked to move to the music.  The live band was proficient and kept the place hopping. Some of the fiddle playing was very good.  Good Four Peaks brews on tap.   There isn't much to not like about the place except when it gets too crowded."}
{"text":"If your looking for a fun night out with the locals this is the place. Great live band. Gwen, the owner, was very kind. The BBQ food was good not great, but the reason to come is the authentic country atmosphere and the live music. I, do, recommend the pulled pork with a great sauce. The servers are old school, so get ready to mix it up and the nicer you are the more attentive. The only negative feedback was the entire night was couple 2 step and would have loved some line dancing!"}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy country music.  The people are friendly and most are ready to dance."}
{"text":"Food was great, good lunch deals. We were in at 230p and the place was empty but the service was extremely slow. We had 4 kids with us who were bored and unruly waiting over 20 min for ice cream!!!  Food = great Service = to be desired"}
{"text":"I read a review that said it was a mix of young and old, so my boyfriend my self and a friend went to give it a shot.  We walk in and WE WERE the young.  That said we still had a great time. The bartenders ARE FRIENDLY (when do you ever meet a NICE bartender), the older crowd is still ok because everyone is so polite and kind.  It's a great place to listen to some country tunes and get away from the hostility of Uppidy, 'Guido' Downtown Nightclubs."}
{"text":"I think Timmy is handsdown the best coolest Manager.. He is in control in th e best way.. I love it when he's there best service,knows what you want and also is funny and entertaining. .."}
{"text":"We like the fish fry so much that we have completely neglected the rest of the menu!  And that is not the only reason to come to H-J!  We don't know of a better place to listen to live country music or get free dance lessons!  Nice big, usually full dance floor...lots of fun!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Scottsdale you want to check out Handle Bar J's! Live country music, friendly staff and an awesome kick ass chicken sandwich topped off by jalapeño bacon. Every Friday they have a fish fry, it's very old school AZ. It's a family owned business and a Scottsdale land mark!"}
{"text":"Great food, love the family owned atmosphere...  Will be bringing out of town friends whenever I can."}
{"text":"Friends of ours invited us to join them for dinner and a night out dancing.  We have never been to Handlebar-J, but heard it was a Scottsdale institution, so we were excited to give it a try.  For dinner, we ordered:  Steak and Enchiladas, $12.75 Sliders, $8.95 Coors  I had the Steak & Enchiladas and they were very good.  It exceeded my expectations.  Even though it wasn't a premium cut of Beef, it was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The Enchiladas were out of this world...wow!  All I can say is wow!  The Better Half had the Sliders and she was very happy with them.  The portion comes with 2 Sliders, which is perfect for her.  After dinner, the music started to play.  We then got our groove on and danced to country & classic rock songs.  The bar also filled up and there was a nice crowd there.  We all had a blast and worked off the calories we ate.  We heard they have country dance lessons on Wednesdays, so we'll be back.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I had the ribs ,corn and potatoes. The meat falls off the bone and the sauce was so yummy. The band was great and I don't listen to country. There was a man and there Ladies he took turn's dancing with each one. I video taped them they were fantastic. We had a great time. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I have been going to handle bar J's for 44 years.  Great food, great entertainment awesome staff and the owners are like family.  I highly  recommend this place to anyone who loves great food and entertainment and a great atmosphere just to be in.   Handle bar is just a wonderful family owned place to just hang out and the Herndons are a great family who own Handle Bar J and have kept it going all these years."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food.  Service was pretty good as well.  Wish the restaurant had more beef items on the menu though.  Just needs a big neon Texas sign on the wall too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! My boyfriend and I decided to come to this place on a Saturday night around 7:45pm about 2 weeks ago. I can not say enough good things about this place.  The service was on point that night. The server helped us with the menu as it was the first time in. We were asked frequently if we needed anything else regardless of the very busy dinner hour going on (even both the owners stopped by our table a few times and asked how everything was).  The food was great, the Saturday night special 1/2 rack of ribs my boyfriend ordered was cooked to perfection, my chicken sandwich was delicious.  They had \"how to two step lessons\" going on when we showed up and they were followed up by a fantastic band that played our kind of country music. We even discovered later that one of the owners was in the band. Needless to say we ended up dancing for a while.  I would recommend this place to both locals and out-of-towners looking to enjoy a true Arizona/southwest experience"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite new hangout in Scottsdale. Food is very good and reasonably priced. Recommend the Fish Fry for sure. Met some amazing locals and played a game of Jumbo Jenga. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went with a party of 8 for dinner at 7.30, they asked for $10 person, including children, as a cover.  I doubt the food is worth an extra $80.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Went here with 2 other couples on a Tuesday night. They were out of their famous ribs and it was line dancing lesson night. We had barbecue chicken which was ok and came with 2 potato wedges and cole slaw. Service was fair and the music fair also. Nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"We were brought here by a friend. Seems to be a very local hang-out with a friendly crowd. Everyone is here to have a good time. The band was on the money as they had everyone on the floor most of the night. The food  looked and smelled good as well. I will have to try it out on the next visit. My impression was left by Enver the bartender. He asked your name once and you were his friend for the rest of the night. He remembered not only your name, but your whole drink order. Aces to this guy."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to go!  However, the food has been lacking and the menu keeps changing.  The food is not consistent and it seems like they must have new kitchen staff every few weeks.  The wait staff is super friendly, the bands are great, and wait staff is quick to get drinks. However,  we say the manager being very rude to a Customer, which was a turn off to us going back to this place.  Plus, if you go to have dinner and have a reservation you still have to pay a cover charge.  That's just greedy!  This place has gone down hill under the new management and is not what I remember from a few years back!"}
{"text":"Showed up on a whim while searching for Happy Hour stops. So on that downside, their craft beer selection was very limited. They had only Stella Artois, Blue Moon & two seasonals; SanTan Oktoberfest & Sam Adams Oktoberfest (I think). But on the upside, their food was frickin awesome. We ordered the chicken wings and the pulled-pork sliders and they were both terrific! So, if you want bomb happy hour apps, go for it. Great beer, eh not so much."}
{"text":"Great small country bar.  Band and staff are fantastic.  Figure out what section Gretchen is working in and sit there.  I am sure the other staff are great, but every time I go I sit in her section.  She is wonderful!  Always smiling and has a great sense of humor.   If you want a small, fun, local bar for country music, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place as it is very \"Old School\" and cute. The food and service were so poor that I just can't. We had several menu items, wings, chili, veggie plate and fries. The chili was not canned, but maybe that would have been better. My hubby said it tasted like a grease trap...I would have asked him to elaborate more, but frankly, I was having challenges of my own with the super salty wings..no hot sauce heat,  but the amount of salt put a real burn in your mouth. Normally the ranch would cool it down, but oops... looks like the salt shaker fell in there too..good thing the veggies were raw and you can't mess them up too much. A bit pricey for what you get, but anything remotely healthy usually is. The service was equally salty, could not believe the lack of training and single track focus. Took forever to get food and drinks. Delivering beverages one glass at a time to a table will never cut it in the long run. In short, need better wait staff, training and for goodness sake, take the salt shaker away from the cook!"}
{"text":"My husband I order food delivery from here all the time. We happen to be right down the street and tried to stopped in and they wanted $10 just to get in to eat because there was band. Cool you have a band, but we came to eat. I'm not going to pay $10 to get in, to then pay for your food. Now I don't even want to get your food delivered.  Too many options around Scottsdale for that weird rule."}
{"text":"Only been here once, looking for some country dancin'. Wednesday night before Thanksgiving, not crowded, good music, and decent drinks. Drinks were more expensive than we are used to, but we didn't pay a cover, so I guess that's breaking even. We didn't order food. My rating is simply for atmosphere, friendly staff, and good music. Since it wasn't crowded, we had room to 2-step and West Coast Swing. We'll be back. (I would guess that a crowded night would have been much less fun for us.)  And we didn't order water."}
{"text":"Came later on a Sunday night for the country dancing while in town for the weekend.  We loved it here!  It is smaller but what a great vibe.  Somewhat crowded but people were friendly and unlike other reviews when we were inevitably bumped on the dance floor (no biggie), all were apologetic.  The DJ played mostly county with a little variety mixed, seemed right on target for the crowd. The drinks were good and even though the kitchen was closed the bartender went and got us chips and salsa!  If we're back in the area we will definitely return here for the relaxed fun vibe they had there.  Maybe even get there early enough to try the dinner."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday before 5 P.M. and as we were about to enter the building an employee walked up to us and looked at us until I said \"2\". He was about to seat us outdoors and I said we would like to sit inside. We went in and there was only one other couple eating in the dining room. The guy was going to seat us at a very small table against a wall when I said can we sit at a larger table. He didn't seemed pleased (remember only one table occupied). He then started to ask us how long we were going to stay. I said we were going to eat and then leave. He then sat us. I was tempted to leave as we did not feel welcome or valued at all as a customer. The food was average at best. The only good thing here was our waiter, Kevin. Kevin was personable, funny and very attentive. Maybe Kevin should be the host/greeter."}
{"text":"This place was very authentic county location.   The potato skins were very good and  BBQ rib was good.   The food had a good portion.   I would differently go back to this place.."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was kid!  Such a great place, best food and amazing music by the Herndon brothers. I highly suggest checking it out"}
{"text":"HBJ's showed us a great time as we enjoyed the best bluegrass string band in AZ, \"The Sonoran Dogs\", good food and a cold beverage. Our service person was also the best as she accommodated our request to sit up front and never let us want for anything as she frequently checked on our table. This is a great place for good food (we had the ribs), great music and a friendly staff in an atmosphere of the old West. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Started off with a Margarita. LJ (bartender) and I have this conversation about what sides I'd like with the Ribeye (I'm going medium rare) ordered. I went his favorite, and then came the option to have sautéed onions and mushrooms on top. I automatically voiced out, \"i never woke up a morning, looked up at the sun, and expected it to shine a certain way for me.\" Needless to say, I went with the chef's choice and experienced the BGO aka Big Game Over.  Called originally and spoke to Joanne, she encouraged me to make the walk in. So i did, and I'm now feeling comfortably full.   The entire staff were all smiles and welcoming...thank you!   The blue grass band, Sonoran Dogs  were great too!"}
{"text":"This is a place that is family owned and operated and has been for decades. It's probably the last of the Scottsdale cowboy bars and remains the real deal. I'd heard about the place for years and finally got around to checking it out. I heard that the ribs were awesome. They are. I heard that the music is great. It is. It's a popular place and can get really busy  during the weekends, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm clunking down five stars on this one. First off, for location. Like the chop and wok, it is right next to my house. This allows for easy stumble home. Second off, the band they have is pretty good. They play the hits, and some dwight yoakam.  I think its about $7 for a jack and coke. Which, isn't too bad.   The upside - cougars The downside - everybody else is 50+|  The owner lady - Gwen (?) she is pretty nice, apparently its her son in the band."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first night my husband and I were going to enjoy a date night at the Handlebar-J for dinner...we were so excited, we live across the street and we were ready for a steak and potato dinner. well we arrived at 8pm and we were told that we had to pay a cover charge of $10 each to get in and I said we are just having dinner tonight to the the lady at the entrance she said we had to pay cover charge for an event and we said well you just lost our business. We will not try them after that... really they should have let us try the dinner menu outside, we were not there for the music or dancing, I hate country western anything we just wanted to try the local restaurant. Never will go back..Really a Terrible idea."}
{"text":"This is a cute little country bar & grill. I pass this place all the time and didn't know it was there. The food was good, the drinks were cold and the music was very country.   They have a nice size dance floor, but not knowing any of the country dances I didn't attempt too much. The band they had the night I was there was okay, but the place was packed. We had a great time and I'm sure we will go back."}
{"text":"I came to Handlebar J tonight for the first time with one of my friends to take some line dancing classes that they host every Tuesday night for $5 per person. As we walked in and started making our way towards the dance floor, the owner stopped us and asked if we wanted a table. Not understanding her, she bluntly stated that the dance lessons are separate and if we want to join in, we have to sit down and order food (two drinks per person or a meal and a drink--mind you, it doesn't say this ANYWHERE on the website. A warning would have been nice. And, it's not to say that we wouldn't have ended up ordering a few drinks or getting some food at some point during the evening, but the way she told us was quite rude.) Since it seemed that we had no other choice, she showed us to a table in the dining room and gave us a couple menus. When our waitress arrived, she explained that these particular menus were only for the bar or patio areas, and that we couldn't order from them. But, once I told her the owner gave them to us, she reluctantly obliged and allowed us to order, ya know, because we are trying to give them our money, I didn't think it would be a problem.   Once we got settled at our table and ordered, it was pointless for us to join the dance lesson as it had already started and we wanted to get our money's worth (I know it's only $5, that wasn't the issue--it was merely the principle of participating in the entire lesson and since we had an awkward start to the whole experience, we didn't even want to bother at this point), so we just watched the other folks enjoying some fun dancing and good music. After we had gotten our food and were halfway through our meal, our waitress asked us if she could move us to another table....um WHAT? As we are finally beginning to somewhat enjoy ourselves, you want us to get up and move because you have a party of 5 that needs this table? I don't think so...but since you're already picking up my drink and my food I guess I'll follow you. She seats us elsewhere and doesn't come back for another 30 minutes. We danced for a little bit and joined in on some of the line dances to try and brighten our situation, but we couldn't get the sour taste out of our mouths.   We decided after an hour of nonsense it was time to leave. Our waitress finally gave us the check; I needed change, and had to hunt down the owner to take care of it for us. She ended up chatting with some guests and seemed to forget that I needed change back. Our waitress finally came to our table and couldn't find our check. She estimated the total of our bill and just handed me my change out of her pocket (definitely didn't give me exact change, but at this point I was so over it.) With a smirk she said, \"here,\" and walked away. I took all of my change and we got the heck out of there.   So extremely disappointed in this joint and it's such a shame because the ambiance and decor are quite nice, as well as the spunky gal who was teaching the lessons--those are about the only two things that Handlebar J has going for them."}
{"text":"The thing is, I don't even like Country music... but I do like this bar. Good folks, great live bands, stiff drinks, and what appears to be decent grub. I have yet to eat here, but have popped in for drinks a time or two. They have an amazing sound system and a large dance floor. In the cooler months their patio is really nice."}
{"text":"I'd give it 2 and a half stars. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. My husband and I went to Handlebar J's when they first opened on Sunday. My chicken was a little too done. My husband asked for medium well on his steak, which means no pink, but don't burn it. Well, the outside was burned and the inside was too rare. He'll eat rare, but he'd rather it be cooked all the way through. What you really pay for there is the atmosphere. I think we will probably give it another shot though."}
{"text":"It was OK, I guess. Probably will never go back because I don't live in the area.  I felt about 10-15 years too young for the crowd here on a Saturday night (for the record, I'm 29). The band didn't play as many country covers as I would like - seemed more like a random mix of oldies and 80's covers rather than country songs (which I would have preferred). The band stops playing at about 1230am. $5 cover.   The crowd was mostly Real Housewives of Scottsdale types and their husbands in western regalia. It was a mellow atmosphere with lots of seating, not crowded at all, and some couples dancing. It was too mellow for me though - kinda boring. Perfect place for my parents though."}
{"text":"This place WAS good at one time but now they usually charge a cover or $5 or $10 and the drinks are overpriced.  We went there for the last time.  I usually order multiple drinks and my wife orders soda or water.  This last time we were charged $4.00 for a 50 cent bottle of water.  They say that they have a dance floor but most of it is covered with tables.  They would be wise and go back 10 years when they had the whole dance floor available and did not gouge the customers.  In addition the music was so loud that the musicians could not hear themselves.  We are musicians so we know what we are talking about."}
{"text":"Really great place with live music most nights. Food is surprisingly good.   Nice outdoor patio to get some quiet time when needed.  Authentic place here. No pretensions or trying to be something it is not."}
{"text":"Went back again with more friends Friday night. Everyone got the Friday Fish Fry and loved it, along with the great live music. So glad this western bar is still alive & doing so well!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ribs and steak were cooked perfectly. Great service! Our server was quick and checked on us often. We had a great time dancing to the live music. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Handlebar J in years and after this visit we'll go more often. As close to perfect a weekend night as you can get in terms of entertainment, food, service and western themed ambience. Obviously the owner takes pride in hospitality. Menu has all the basics and is reasonably priced. (If you're looking for Scottsdale foo foo this ain't your place). Everything was perfect from seating to drinks, food and service. The band started promptly at 745 and played popular country western not overly loud with a large dance floor. Sort of small restaurant, large bar and very large patio. Recommend you make a reservation for optimal seating. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here after essentially being turned away from the neighboring pizza joint (we were a party of 2, they had one remaining open table but it was a 4-top) because we were told the only available seating was at the bar. We left and decided to follow the crowd right through the doors of Handlebar-J.  Fish fry night. Under $10. How can that be passed up on?   The cod was firm yet tender. The breading was near perfect. Not heavy. Not oily. And it had to be more than a pound! The fries were nothing special.   Server was very attentive and polite.  They had a live band playing. The acoustics in here are not the best. But, the band was decent. And, there were many couples having a blast out on the dance floor. Good for them. It made it fun to hang out and chill.  Not really a young person hang out. Most of the dancers were easily 40+. One guy cutting a rug on almost every song had to be at least 80. That man had moves.  Dessert was offered (read my other reviews) so, of course we had to reward the effort. Chocolate cobbler. Two words that I didn't think went together. Boy was I wrong. Amazing flavor. Nice texture. A bit lean with the scoop of ice cream. But, for $6 this rivals the pizza cookies popular in a lot of restaurants.  If I'm in the area at dinner time, this is a place I'm coming back to. A really nice, local-flavor, alternative to the endless choice of chains in the area."}
{"text":"Got a group of friends together for a Saturday night and thought HBJ's would be a great place to cut loose.  The restaurant is set up with long tables all picnic style but it worked for us.  Our waitresses were AMAZING and deserve a 5 star rating, kept separate tabs for all of us, handled a group of 12 with ease.  The food was so so but the place is meant to be a country bar so I can understand food isn't their priority.  My low review is based on the owner.  After dinner, we all wanted to mingle a bit and asked if we could take the large high top table right behind us.  I asked if we could keep part of our dinner table just in case someone wanted to sit and our waitress said ok.  Five minutes later an old lady came over and asked if we were keeping our dining table.  I said we didn't need the entire table but wanted to keep some chairs in case we wanted to sit.  The old lady slapped me on the back and told me she was the owner and was going to \"kick me out\" for asking to keep our table.  Then she abruptly walked away.  I was very confused but a few moments later she went up to another member of our group and threatened to kick them out too!  Turns out she wanted to seat a group of her regulars at our table (even though I had called ahead and made a reservation).  It was very clear she didn't want our business so we paid, tipped our server well and left.  Probably won't go back either."}
{"text":"Great ribs and steak experienced in a Wild West setting served by a wonderfully warm and helpful waitress.  We'll. be back for live music and more good food.  Great place to take visiting friends and family from the North."}
{"text":"Update: Just visited Handlebar J's again (2/2018) and have to bring my rating down to a 2. Menu has changed (no more fish tacos) and the food that everyone in our party ordered was sub-par. Still a fun place to go-maybe just for drinks-but service not great and they weren't too accommodating."}
{"text":"Last night, it was my moms birthday and she wanted to go country dancing. I did some research and found this place. I put out an evite and had about 8 people confirm. I called and made a reservation and told the hostess that I didn't know who was eating or just drinking. She said there's a perfect table in the bar and we could have that. I asked if I could bring in cupcakes for my mom and she literally said this...\" no, because you guys aren't eating\". Um....what? I just said I didn't know who was eating or not. I mean..I AM bringing 8 people into your establishment. So, we show up and take our table and everyone ordered food and drinks....everyone....so I was putting candles in the cupcakes and this hostess comes over and says...Im sorry, I thought I told you that you couldn't bring those. Seriously? I said, well...we in fact DID eat and we in fact ARE drinking so maybe I need to speak to your manager so I can find out just how much we need to spend so I can give my mom a cupcake on her birthday!? She goes to get him and tells him the story and this guy doesn't even have the courtesy to come by and say anything...at all. He sends her back over (which is a mistake in my opinion as she is being extremely rude) and she says...\"you're fine\", turns around and walks away. Service started out really good and ended up really bad. We had to ask for more water repeatedly and go to the bar and order our own beers. The 2 stars is for the fantastic food. We had fish tacos, ribs, pulled chicken sandwiches, a burger, cheese crisp, onion rings and potato skins....all were great. The food runner was awesome. He brought us plates and silverware which is key when you eat food at a restaurant. Overall, I'd say the food was great, the band was fun and we had a great time dancing etc...I'd say the hostess needs to dial her attitude down a notch or 2 and if management has an issue with a table doing something he thinks isn't appropriate, then maybe he should talk to said table. I'm just glad my mom had a great birthday as she was unaware of what was happening."}
{"text":"I can't rate lower, if I could I would. That beach at the door has the personality of a mule. Pun intended for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried to come here on Christmas around 10 pm. Called ahead of time to make sure they were open, as we didn't want to drive 18 people all the way to a bar that was closing soon. The man on the phone was very rude and stated that they were CLEARLY open. 20 minutes later when my party arrived in Three XL ubers with 18 people we were kicked out before we were even able to grab a drink. Now I understand closing early for Christmas and wish you have a fabulous evening with your family. BUT I don't appreciate you wasting mine and my family's time and money to go someplace that wasn't trying to stay open. Extremely disappointed and annoyed we had to deal with such a hassle. Mean what you say and say what you mean."}
{"text":"The service was great and they were very polite.  The bartender was very attentive and the live band was gr areas well.  Nice atmosphere and cowboy bars and restaurants don't get enough good publicity."}
{"text":"I took my lady out on a date here and I felt completely out numbered. We are both in our early twenties and the people who go here are definitely in the age group of 40s-70s. She didn't care as much but it was still just a bit of an uncomfortable night for me... You win some you lose some, oh well not my cup of tea, but it did seem like a cool place to go to in 15-20 years. 6/10"}
{"text":"We've been going to HBJ for dinner for years and have enjoyed the food and atmosphere. They now charge $5 per head just to walk in and eat a burger and leave. It's not worth $10 extra for a couple to stop in for a drink and dinner."}
{"text":"I have never tried the food here.  It is busy on Friday & Saturday nights, but crowded and you have to pay a cover unless you are fast enough to jump the fence on the side.  Don't worry--the old ladies they hire to watch the gate won't notice.  But if one of the male bartenders catch you ya better run fast!  Usually the cover goes away after 1am.    If you are going here with the intention  to pick up girls DO NOT go here.  Not  many (if any) worth looking at (unless you are fat, old & ugly--you might get lucky!!), and the few that might worth hitting on   are regulars or married--both spoken for.  Hitting on them will only get you in a fight. YEEE HAH! Thursday used to be a good night to go, but the economy sucks, and ALL places are empty on Thursday now.  Might be worth a try once but unless you are a true redneck, or think you are, you are probably wasting your time."}
{"text":"First of all, they start charging cover charge hours before any other bar, even if you are going inside to spend $100 on a steak dinner. The older lady at the entrance is rude and forgetful. Scott the bartender is the best thing about the place. The band is usually the Herndon brothers and when they are singing country are flipping awesome, but then they have dreaded bouts of Kenny Loggins and other non-country songs that make me want my cover charge back. The band stops playing around what seems like 11:30 on weekend nights which is a ripoff. There used to be a DJ between band sets, but now it's a jukebox so we can no longer request our favorite line dances."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after an afternoon play nearby.  We sat at the bar (on a Saturday) and asked if they had a Happy Hour.  Much to our surprise, they did.  Not only were the dirty martinis the best we have had, they were on Happy Hour.  LJ is the bartender's name . . . and let me tell you, he was so attentive, informative and kind.  He made us feel like we were \"someone\".    We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You must like country music and dancing if you go here.  I've been here twice for drinks and dancing with my country-lovin' friends.  I've never eaten here.  The drinks are A-OK, but the people (late night folks) seem to creep out of the crazy pictures on the wall.  Let's just say I try to hide in the corner so no one asks me to dance!"}
