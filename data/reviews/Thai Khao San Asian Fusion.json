{"text":"Just had lunch here. Extremely tasty and well prepared. Had chicken satay and the peanut sauce was absolutely the best I've ever had. Red curry was exceptional. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"What a super casual spot. My wife and I stopped in for lunch Yesterday, and it was terrific. My wife had the Thai Basil Chicken and loved it. I had the red curry with shrimp. Both entries were large and delicious. The $7.95 lunch comes with soup, rice, and the best spring roll ever"}
{"text":"Great place food is on point. The service is great which is different from other places.  Chicken pad Thai is awesome so is the mossuman curry.   Keep up the great job !"}
{"text":"I keep returning. It's great food and often very quick. Their pad Thai is delicious and comes in a large portion. My boy friend loved their curry. If is you ask they will make it extra spicy. I have not a had a bad meal.  We eat in and often are the only ones in the dinning room. The lady that takes care of us is very friendly and quick. Our water glasses never run out. The booths are cozy and give a casual feeling to the atmosphere. I haven't had a bad meal here so I will continue to return."}
{"text":"My first restaurant ever visited in Gastonia (I live in Charlotte), and I couldn't have been more surprised that a restaurant serving authentic Thai food is available.  I've been for lunch twice, each time ordering the red coconut curry with chicken.  The curry is as good as I've ever had at any other Thai restaurant on the east coast.  Vegetables were fresh and chicken was as expected.  For $8 it includes a small soup and spring roll, not a bad deal for fresh, quality food!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in gastonia. The pad woon sen was great. Being off of 321 in the historic district it is easy to not want to stop looking at this place from the outside. I was pleasantly surprised with the food"}
{"text":"In the words of Michael Scott...\"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...strike three\". I originally tried this place out two months ago and ordered the sesame chicken. The chicken was in this weird shape and rubbery. The sauce lacked taste and was extremely watery. I also ordered chicken wings that had to of been sitting there for days. The wings were burnt and the \"meat\" was dry. I had never been back until recent because I had a twice for Pho. I absolutely love pho and have 3 favorite places that I go to in Charlotte. Now that I frequent Gastonia I gave this place another shot. Big mistake. The broth was water down, there was mixture of noodles and the vegetables were not fresh. As you can see from the pics the basil was bad looking and the onions were not fresh. The meat was tough and chewy and again did not taste fresh. The pho was supposed to come with beef balls. When I called back to ask about it she said \"oh I forgot to tell you that we ran out\"...really and you still charged me full price. I will never return to this establishment. I really look forward to Gastonia becoming more diverse because this place no longer exists in my mind"}
{"text":"Server was not friendly and never refilled my beverage. The green curry was overly sweetened, but they were were willing to replace it with another entree. The next dish was okay, but very greasy. According to reviews I've seen, along with my own experience, they seem to frequently be out of soup that is supposed to be included with the lunch combos. They didn't even tell me that they were out. I had to inquire after my meal arrived. I would have given a lower rating except the mango and sticky rice was amazing! Also, they closely follow social media and promised to make up for the missing soup when I return to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Started with tom kha soup.  4 huge shrimp in a coconut broth.  Delicious.  Only negative was the addition of a diced lemon grass which was fibrous and chewy.  Had a pile to the side.  The dumplings were crispy and flavorful.  Would get again.  I got the pad Thai, Pat got the pad see ew.  Amazing!!! Authentic.  Delicious.  Can't wait to eat through the menu!"}
{"text":"With curry being difficult to find in Gastonia, I decided to give this restaurant a try. I love it, and have come back many times. Another plus is that when you tell them to make your food very spicy, it's actually very spicy! Lots of restaurants are unable to make your food \"very spicy\" when you instruct them to do so.  The staff and owner are very nice as well. They kind of know me now. I would definitely give this place a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Sooooo this was the first time we ate here and we were so excited! We wanted to try Thai food and it was just disgusting. Lol I don't know if it's all Thai food or just this place, I have no idea. I got pad Thai vegetarian and as soon as she brought it to the table I thought it didn't look bad, it looked okay. It smelled just like wet dog and that's the best way I could explain it. The smell of it made me gag. My husband got red chicken curry and he grimaced the entire time he ate it. When the waitress came back she asked how it was and I told her I cousln t eat it. Obviously I had not even touched it. The only reason I gave it too stars is because my husband asked them to take off my meal and they let us. I was very taken back how terrible it was. They were so sweet and i am so glad they let us take off the food."}
{"text":"As goos as any Thai in Charlotte and better than most! Love this place!!"}
