{"text":"Holy cow...I would sell my mother for a lifetime supply of olive & onion calzones from this place. The dough is perfect. The blend of cheeses (including ricotta) make me swoon with their creamy and stringy textures. The dipping sauce is good, but if they would only heat it before serving it, this would be a 6-star review."}
{"text":"holy mother of god.   yum.  best.cleveland.pizza.ever.  hands down.  and really nice people.  fast forward, three months from now, when i can't fit in any of my clothes....

{"text":"At first, I thought I was REALLY going to love this pizza.  The smells coming out of the shop (as well as the box on the way home) were extremely promising.  But did anyone else find this pizza a bit too heavy/greasy?  I had not only one, but at least TEN of those garlic cloves in butter sauce poured on top of the pizza.  A bit overwhelming.  And it was like I had ordered extra cheese...but I hadn't.  Usually, that would be a welcome surprise, but in this case, it made the cheese pretty much slide off the pizza because of the sheer weight of it.  I will definitely try Big Guy's again to see if I just had an off-day.  The flavors and friendliness of this mom-and-pop place are enough reason for me to give it another chance."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Tremont.  Not only is it cheaper than the neighborhood competition (8.99 1-topping large), it is straight up tastier from the crust up to the toppings.  Who cares about packages of honey when you can get a freakin' head of garlic in the center of your pie."}
{"text":"Oh. Oh my.  The're open late, you get a whole thingy (clove?  flower?) of garlic right smack in the middle of your pie.  They'll bring it to you while you sit next door at Hotz drinking.  Truly amazing."}
{"text":"I spoke with the owner years ago when I first moved to Tremont. He said he is from the east coast and makes a NY style pizza. Things about it are true to the style, like the oven. However, he cooks the pizzas in these weird pans and then to finish them off, he will throw them down on the stone. I wish he would cook them on the stone the whole time. The crust is covered in oil. I always think that is weird. To make matters even crazier, he throws a garlic bulb in the middle of the thing at the end. He is a really nice guy and takes pride in the pizza he makes. The pizza is good and probably the best in Tremont. There really isn't anywhere great to go for pizza in this neighborhood. Or even the entire city for that matter."}
