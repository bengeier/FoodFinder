{"text":"I've only ever had the pizza here, so I can't comment on anything else this place serves. It's also the only reason that I'm giving the place four stars instead of five, because I can't fairly give a full review. Others seem to really like the hoagies here. They also have homemade pierogis and even some Fillipino fare, which I plan to try sometime.

The pizza is really good and very affordable. They run a $6 extra large carry out special. Even with a couple toppings, it's still under $11 for a 16 inch pie. Toppings are $2 each, a reasonable price, and adequately proportioned. 

The sauce is slightly on the sweet side, for those of you who like a sweeter sauce, but not sickeningly sweet. The crust is a little on the thinner side as well, but not quite Italian Village like, for those of you who have ever had their pizza. It's a good tasting crust.

It's a nice place to pick up a delicious pie for a very reasonable price. They sell Turner's tea here too, a big plus for me."}
{"text":"My go-to for tasty and affordable pizza. I always get the large pick up deal, it's unbeatable. I'm also a huge fan of the onion straws. I have yet to get anything from here that I do not like. My order is always ready fast and they have never got it wrong. The staff is also very polite."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Pizzeria in the Boro(s). Nothing beats John's white pizza, it's only rival is homemade. Every member of the staff is absolutely wonderful and polite. Honestly if you cannot find something to love on the menu, you're not trying the right things. Everything from the Italian Hoagie to the HOMEMADE Pierogis, to the Fillipino items are absolutely delicious. Oh! & don't forget the dessert! Super affordable, fresh ingredients, & We've never had a cold delivery. I will always suggest Da Vinci's!"}
