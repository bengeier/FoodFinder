{"text":"Literally the best hot dog I've ever eaten. Try the mac & cheese dog- seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"Joe has a burger and hot dog cart parked just outside Tepper Business School.  Rain or shine he is there serving p some decent burgers and dogs for the price.  I've had better burgers, sure, but for the price (and convienence) Joe can't be beat."}
{"text":"This is one of the best food carts on the CMU campus.  I am not a particular fan of food cart cuisine but how can you turn down a hot dog?  Compared to a ballpark, for example, the prices are quite good.  I will go 100 times and 99 times order a hot dog.  I am not afraid to take someone who does not enjoy hot dogs, however, as Joe's has other excellent alternatives including vegetarian sandwiches and chicken burgers.  It is fun to mingle with the other patrons.   This is my go to for quick affordable  food truck food at CMU."}
{"text":"Good food is a rarity to find on the Carnegie Mellon campus, and I'm glad that we have a hot dog stand to compensate for that. The hot dogs are solid, cooked right in front of you, and served by a super nice guy. The prices are still a little high, but compared to the hiked up pricey trash that the school serves, this place really deserves a compliment."}
