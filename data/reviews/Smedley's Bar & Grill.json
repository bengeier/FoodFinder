{"text":"Decent neighborhood place, friendly staff.  Demographic skews a little older than some of the other bars in its vicinity that cater more to the young bros. Smedley's also books some good bands, mostly of the blues-jam variety, on a regular basis.  
It's a good place to go if you just want to drink a beer and not be in the middle of a bunch of loud 22-year-olds looking to hook up, if you know what I mean. The beer selection is decent, if maybe a dollar or so higher per beer than some of the other bars.  You should be able to find something good. There is also a pool table for hire.
Since I was going to bars before anyone ever heard of a smoking ban in a bar, I am not concerned if someone is smoking indoors instead of outside on the sidewalk. In any event I either haven't encountered this or it was 1 person and I didn't notice or care. 
This place bills itself as a \"restaurant\" elsewhere, but it closes the kitchen pretty early and don't even offer a later menu of fries or poppers (they have bags of storebought potato chips).  If you want to eat I'd say get there by 8:30 or you run the risk of being shut out."}
{"text":"I've been into Smedleys on a number of occasions while out on my motorcycle, but about 4 months ago I ordered a burger for the first time. It was excellent!  Very tender with just the right amount of char on the outside and juicy flavor on the inside. 

Their meat is hormone and steroid free and you can tell they're not lying. 

The atmosphere is cop/ex-military/biker but everyone was friendly. 

The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that after telling my friends how great the burgers are, we went there ant waited 40 minutes only to get our burgers a bit overcooked. Also, they still allow people to smoke in the place. 

Still one of the best burgers ever."}
{"text":"Horrible bar not enough room un friendly staff. Bathrooms suck no sign on the door for mens.
Save your money go some where else. No parking anywhere."}
{"text":"Smedley's is a great local hangout.  Don't fear the bikers, they make everyone feel welcome and comfortable.  GREAT bands, the drinks are very reasonably priced and the food is always yummy.  Sean caters to Vets, Bikers, Mom and Pops, anyone who wants to have a good time in a 'chill' atmosphere.  Cash is appreciated!  Tip well and your drinks will flow like a river.  Parking (plenty of it) is behind Walgreen's.  Sure, the bathrooms aren't 'special', but go elsewhere and pay $5 for a beer if you want that."}
{"text":"The first time I ended up at Smedley's, I was on a \"hang out\" (as in, not a date, but we're going to sleep together) with a tall lanky 24 yr old. I had moved to Kamm's corner about a year before, but being a staunch Ohio City bar fly (read: hipster snob), I hadn't bothered to walk the three blocks to any of the bars actually by my house. They seemed too full of pastel polo shirts and women who thought they ought to have babies by 24, before they would consider going to school. This guy had a bunch of his younger friends there, and I felt my 31 years really keenly, also I was having Common Grounds flashbacks to high school, and acting on those feelings, we made out a lot by the back door. 

I hadn't been back for a while, because I didn't want to run into that guy, but then I found myself on another \"hang out\" with a guy on a Sunday afternoon. This guy was actually in my age group, thank god, and we had decided to go on a tour of dive bars. We started at the Rowley Inn, which had been cheap and fun, but then got sort of uncomfortable when a lot of the more exuberant regulars showed up, so I suggested Smedley's next because it was closer to where we lived, and the memory I had of it was just dirty enough to qualify. 

This time we walked in through the front door, and it was immediately exactly what we wanted. The bar was clean and warm and the staff was nice. There was a group of either off duty firemen or policemen playing pool in the back, and a guy spinning old 60s and 70s rock in the front. It seemed like the place where any of the patrons would stand up to and kick out troublemakers. The clientele oozed old school attitude - family, country, beer. We talked about music a lot, I bounced around on my stool to the songs, we ogled the military and police badges on the wall. The music was just loud enough to force us to lean in when talking, but not so loud you couldn't hear what the other person was trying to tell you about late 90's indie rock. If the Rowley is the kind of dive bar where someone might be scared of the hipsters ruining it, then Smedley's is the kind of bar which nothing can ever ruin because it is exactly the same as it's been for 20 years and will continue to be that way no matter how many of those damn kids show up. Seeing as my date and I were just old enough to not be those kids anymore, it was perfect. Later, instead of making out in a car, we went and listened to vinyl while drinking wine in his living room. This is called growing up.

If you've ever wanted to have a fireman buy you a drink, this is the place to go. Or a police man. I imagine one of those two groups is going to pissed off I assumed the other group hangs out at Their Bar."}
{"text":"I don't understand how they get away with letting people smoke cigarettes inside there.  I don't like smoke."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Smedleys for a while now, as it's a West Park fixture. Went there Sat. About six (6). Walked in found a table, and sat down, still not sure if they have a service staff. Place was loud and full of smoke and smokers. Add this to the fact that the place is both dirty and a mess, we decided to go to across the street to P.J.s and have a good meal. A real disappointment."}
{"text":"If you want to get ripped off then come here. Pay cash only! I was here for 45 minutes and paid for 18 beers."}

{"text":"Ok not much can be topped- but they do have it locked in for a \"BIG Yay\" in 3 categories!  

1. A jamming Blues Band that is a must see when in Cleveland!! 
\"The Bad Boys of Blues\" are I think weekly regulars there and are great!! 
2. You can't get a bartender much better than Jamie- she's beautiful, witty, smart (might make another gal jealous unless she's just as cool;-) and can make a great drink (hard to imagine but that's true!)
3. Only half dozens times in my life have I liked a burger better-Juicy Lucy at Matts Bar in Minneapolis, possibly a Butter Burger in WI, and likely the rest were with BFFs at White Castles after a night of too many and well almost anything would taste good. So let's just say I ate it upon arrival and I was sober (so yes it was that good). 
Will without a doubt venture back in when I ever/will return to Cleveland! Now it's on my \"to do again\" list!!"}
{"text":"Visiting my cousin for the holiday weekend and our plans changed as we got the date wrong for a local band at another venue. I Yelped \" Dive Bar \" and Smedleys came up. My cousin was familiar with it but had never been there. Was a super time! A band called \" The Front \" were playing. They were on time and wow was I suprised with their playlist and ability to tackle the songs. The opening song was Ziggy Stardust by David Bowie and they did a couple Who songs, Aerosmith \"Toys in the Attic \".  The Beatles \" \"Helter Skelter\" ( Charlie Manson tribute?? ) ,  3 AC - DC songs in another tribute. While ordering a drink which were reasonably priced and mixed well I was standing beside a gal chowing down on chicken soup and she said it was delicious. Looked very hearty! Had a FANTASTIC time DANCING, MIXING N MINGLING and I recommend!"}
{"text":"Just moved here, and wandered into Smedley's based on the recommendation of a old Navy guy.  For those turned off by smoking, it no longer happens and the bar is smoke-free.  Food is extremely reasonable, and very good.  Beer/alcohol is reasonable as well.  As has been noted, crowd tends to ex-military (bar is named after famous Marine Corps general), bikers, cops, but lots of good regular people too and is very friendly.  They've had some good bands on the nights we've been there -- almost surprisingly so.

It's exactly the kind of place I was looking for - even though I didn't even know I was looking -- so it's five stars for me.  If you're looking for trendy, or a pickup spot for 20-somethings, this isn't it.  Not pretentious -- just a good place for good food and beers, good music, and no hipster attitudes.

Ooh-rah."}
{"text":"Modern biker bar.  They often have live music and the beer is cold.  It's frequented by modern Harley guys."}
{"text":"This is a very great place especially on the week end bands are great . They play real rock music here Sabbath etc. The bar tenders are great also its a safe place alot of bikers come here but let me tell you your safer here then most places . The patrons come in have a good time and go home no BS. Kudos Smedleys your bands kick ass"}
{"text":"I've been to Smedley's a handful of times and I've always had fun there!  The staff is friendly and the service is fast...they keep up quite well even with a packed house. It's my kind of crowd that hangs out there, too. Blue-collar, some bikers, kinda gritty, no-nonsense people!  The opposite of a frat house atmosphere!  Last night I tried their food for the first time. The menu was surprisingly large and diverse!  I saw a lobster mac & cheese being offered as a special. As tempting as that was, my husband & I opted to split a bacon black & blue burger with tater tots and some hot wings. The burger was FANTASTIC!  (And HUGE!) The bartender even commented on how good it looked!  Anyhow, it was juicy & flavorful. Very fresh-tasting!  The tater tots were some of the best I've ever had!  I'm not sure if they're house made or from a bag but either way, they were delish!  The wings were pretty good too!  
Every time I've been there it was to see a band. Be forewarned that it's LOUD up by the small \"stage\" area!  (Fine with me but if you're there for quiet conversation it's not gonna happen when the band's playing!)
Anyhow, I really like Smedley's!  I'm sure I'll find myself there at least a handful of times more!
(PS: The past couple times I've been there there hasn't been any indoor smoking. That seemed to be a sticking point for a lot of reviewers.)"}
