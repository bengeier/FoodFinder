{"text":"Great place for drinks and watching sports games....however the food is a different story. The majority of our group thought the food tasted like it was frozen and pre-packaged (my burger was burnt and chewy). It wasn't terrible but I was expecting better given the price point and atmosphere. .. I would only go there for the drinks"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Sub par beer list and clearly all food was frozen.  Ceiling was leaking and water was coming in the windows."}
{"text":"Came here tonight w my three kids. It was amazing. Food was fantastic and service was fast and friendly. My kids were able to play ski-ball, pop a shot and pool while I socialized with my fiends. We all loved it and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new place opening in the area, but I ended up being pretty disappointed by the food at Varsity.   I knew going in that it would just be standard bar food, but this was by far the greasiest bar food I've ever had. My husband and I ordered the soft pretzels for an app and when they arrived, they were swimming in some buttery/oily liquid and tasted that they might have taken a quick dip in the fryer. It was a good thing we ordered an app because the food took quite a while to arrive. I didn't think much of it because Varsity has just recently opened and they're probably still working out the kinks in the kitchen. My husband got the Roma burger, which he said was okay. I got the T-BELT (turkey and egg on a BLT, plus some cheese). I expected sliced turkey, but it actually came as a turkey burger. No big deal, though. I could tell that my sandwich was either sitting under warming lamps for a while or got microwaved because the lettuce was hot and wilted, and the over-easy egg was cooked solid. The toasted bread was so saturated with whatever cooking spread the kitchen used and I constantly had to wipe the oil from my hands. My glass almost slipped from my hand when I tried to pick it up! The weirdest thing: they spread cheese sauce (presumably the same cheese sauce that was served with the pretzels--basically liquid nacho cheese) on the bread instead of actual cheese. I ended up only eating the tots ($1 extra), turkey burger, and egg. Oh yeah, the bacon? Three tiny shriveled strips.   We will likely go back again, but probably just for drinks. I'll consider trying food again, but not for a few more months with the hope that the food will improve once the kitchen becomes more established."}
{"text":"This is a new place, only open for 2 months when I visited, so I know that they are still working out some of the kinks. Honestly, I did not even know that this was a new restaurant until I saw its happy hour sign. I thought it was a varsity sports store for Hudson athletics, kind of like Stow Sports in Stow. We started with the Buffalo chicken dip, which was good and not very spicy, because remember, I cannot do spicy at all. After that, I got the bbq chicken pizza, and it was delicious, but big enough to share, even if it says that it is a personal pizza. Overall, I liked this place, and I would go back. They have a fire pit in the front, which will be nice this summer and fall. Our waitress was very nice, and the restaurant was clean. I noticed they have a game room in the back, which I would like to check out. The music was a little loud for a dinner setting, and this is coming from a 25-year-old. So you know it must have been loud. There are a few kinks to work out for the place, but I think that over time, it will get better. I hate giving it a bad review because I know that it is just starting and that it is someone's dream to have opened this restaurant. It would actually be a great place to catch the Cavs game on Sunday (game 7 -- go Cavs!)"}
{"text":"First stopped here in the winter right after they opened.  I'll admit it was still a work in progress.  I'm glad I've gone back a couple of times this summer.  For food, there are more serious places in town.  You want to meet friends and catch a game.  It's perfect."}
{"text":"Worse restaurant in Hudson. Not impressed.  This place will not last long. Reminds me of a college bar with no thought put into its design or Atmosphere. Clearly the owner or designer has never owned a restaurant. The acoustics were awful!  Very tinny and annoyed me the entire time. They need carpet or acoustic tiles on walls to absorb sound. Food was all frozen foods heated up with no thought put into the menu. We had a burger and the Phili sandwich. Phili was over cooked and chewy. Burger was completely black and not edible. I showed the server the burger twice and both times just said sorry.  We paid the bill and left the burger. I also noticed a strange smell when I entered which I never could figure out. Bathroom was dirty which for a new place was unacceptable. Anyone who wrote a positive review either works here or has no taste. The server was friendly and I could tell he was doing his best but probably had never been trained."}
{"text":"Food was really good, place was clean and service was great.  So why 3 stars?????   The place is so loud we had to leave after eating bc we could not hear ourselves talk.  We went to another bar for drinks afterwards down the street. Not sure who designed thr steel interior (& celing) but that was stupid. Wish i could go back but never will u til i hear others have had a good conversation there."}
{"text":"Hudson's newest sports bar is pretty awesome. As all new restaurants do, it went through a few kinks when it first opened, but they all seem to have worked out.   My favorite thing to get is the chicken wings, and my husband loves the sliders. The prices on all the menu items are extremely reasonable.   The inside is always extremely clean, and there's plenty of seating with a good view of a TV to watch a game. There is also a game room with pool and darts, etc.   Lastly, Varsity has a really nice little patio complete with a fire pit."}
{"text":"We found it to be a family friendly sports bar-great burgers and fresh cut fries.  I had the salad with mango and salmon.  It was very good-could have been improved with fresh mango and mixed greens but hey, it is a sports bar.  The patio has a nice fire pit.  I asked to see the kitchen and was impressed with how clean it is...this is where your meal begins."}
{"text":"Took my kids here with my parents for their birthday, and the recommendation of one of their friends.  I was very hopeful, but not impressed.  How does a burger place not have a burger kids meal?!?!  I ordered chili and a side salad.  After a 1/2 hour, AFTER everyone else's food was brought out, the waiter told me they were out of Chili!  My moms \"Chicken burger\" was a pile of chicken....how is a chicken burger not a patty?  They did give me a complimentary rack of ribs instead...except they tried to charge for it....and the Chili they were out of.  The ribs WERE pretty good.  The boys said their burgers were good.  The most telling thing was that Flip Sides had a 1.5 hour wait....and Varsity was almost empty.  I give this place 4 months max...."}
{"text":"We really like this restaurant but the service needs to drastically improve.  We were the only ones in the restaurant and the service was terrible.  They have good food and prices."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and each time it is getting better.  New place so they are starting to work it out.   Great place to watch games as there are plenty of Big Screens.   Also very family friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really wish I could rate this place better. I had high hopes going into this place, that quickly plummeted. We had to wait a while to be seated despite there being no wait. It took forever to get our drinks and our food. Our waitress only appeared every twenty minutes or so. The food was bland and unseasoned. And the noise level was insane. There is no fabric to absorb any of the noise. I could not hear the person I was seated with at my table. The only good thing about this place was my drink, which was a Sprite..."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The food here is not good and is typical crappy bar food. Service was unorganized and very slow. The drink I ordered was wrong and the owner argued with me about this. I don't care if the bartender has 20 years experience, if the drink is wrong, it wrong. Avoid this place. Do yourself a favor a get a drink from a real bartender  (Nate at flipside)"}
{"text":"There are not many restaurants that not only satisfy the kids AND the adults. Food portions are huge and the cost is low. Lots of TVs for the sports fans. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"The stench of fried food that smacked me in the face when I walked in should've been my first clue that this place is bad news.   Once seated, it took a full 8 minutes for an employee to acknowledge our presence - despite the fact that we were one of only 6 occupied tables.   We ordered drinks and wings. The drinks came out fairly quickly, which was good. However, they were terrible. I had hoped that the wings would be better, but sadly they were not. The very first wing I picked up was stone cold in the middle. I'll be lucky if I don't get salmonella! The waitress offered to take them back and have the order remade, but I declined - assuming that they would simply pop the remaining 11 wings in the microwave. She took them away and agreed to remove them from the bill.  When we informed her that the drinks were also no good, she began to argue with us - saying that she saw the bartender make them herself, pressing to know what *exactly* was wrong with them. We explained in detail, and she continued to argue with us.  Shortly thereafter, the manager (owner?) came over to argue some more - insisting that the bartender has over 20 years' experience, and that he also personally witnessed her making the drinks. Despite our complaints and overall dissatisfaction with the service, food and drinks, they refused to remove the drinks from the bill - even though we had only taken one sip and refused to finish them.   Rest assured - I will not be back, and will certainly be disputing the charge the moment it posts to my credit card account."}
