{"text":"They are no longer 24 hours, which I expected as the few times I visited it was pretty empty.

Staff is friendly and attentive but the menu is spotty. Loved my breakfasts there (pancakes, eggs, eggs benny, hashbrowns, french toast, fruit were all great) but dinner was a disaster. The french fries are terrible and the burger was the worst I've had, livery and dry, I couldn't finish it. I'm sticking to breakfast items from now on."}
{"text":"The renovation was very disappointing; I thought the Grille was unique before the reno, now it's just ordinary.
Now you have to WAIT for your coffee refill, as they no longer give you a thermos of coffee and the wait can be long.
In my opinion the Grille has lost points with this reno, the only redeeming item is that the food is still great."}
{"text":"A little expensive for the diner atmosphere of the place.  My in house burger patty was very salty and my chocolate milk tasted like powder.  Service was friendly but food took 25 min for lunch.  Not terrible, but there are much better places in the area for less $."}
{"text":"Took my Mom here for a breakfast treat to start off her day.  Great attentive waitresses.  Was asked 4 times if I wanted a coffee refill during our meal.  The food was great.  Of us three, two people both ordered the Eggs Benedict, which was perfect.  I had the Floridian Cinnamon French Toast with fresh strawberries, bananas, and whipped cream with bacon added on.  It was great and the bacon was nice and crispy.  No one had anything negative to say.  We will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"So we decided to head out to Ikea on Saturday around 11am and while en route we decided that to go on an empty stomach would be a bad idea, so we got off the Gardiner at Islington and started driving west to see what we could find on the way. On our left, we saw a sign with an electric screen integrating the scrolling words \"ALL DAY BREAKFAST\" and we pulled in.

We decided to sit on the patio which is along the side of the building near the back, and we had menus in hand upon seating. Its a pretty good sized menu but we went with the breakfast menu. I forget what its called that I ordered, something like The Hometown Favourite or something to make it sound like it was the \"go to\" option for breakfast. $8.50 got you 2 eggs, 3 pieces of bacon, 2 sausages, 1 piece of ham, home fries, toast and coffee. Everything was prepared perfectly (the home fries were especially nice, not deep fried flavourless things like some places) and the coffee was being refilled quickly, everything was just as it should be. 5 stars without a doubt.

Apparently the place is even open 24 hours so although I am literally never in this area unless going to Ikea or going to the Queensway Cineplex, its good to know that if Im ever around here otherwise and in need of some scrambled eggs at 4am that I have somewhere to go."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for many years.
For the most part this place is very good.
Cant beat the thurssay night rib special..$15.99..and Ive never been disappointed.
Breakfast can be hit and miss. Usually it is good but the last couple of times the sausages and the eggs (scrambled) were extremely over cooked but for $5.25 its worth the chance.

PS:
Not sure why it is mentioned that it is closed. 
The place is still alive 'n kicking"}
{"text":"Pretty decent. The western sandwich is a lot like my mothers, which is a good thing. The homefries are like a mix of chips and hashbrowns but pretty good as well."}
