{"text":"So this was night of firsts for me. First time using Yelp to choose a restaurant, first time eating Korean BBQ and first Yelp review.    So family and I were looking to try something new and I wanted to try out this app on my new Android. I pretty much chose this place based on the previous reviewer. And turned out, she was spot on for everything. The food was great, we had the \"All You Can Eat Dinner\", which is $16.99 per person.  We got to try everything, and I mean everything. Our table could barely contain all the dishes, sides and condiment that they served. I think my favourite were the ribs. But pretty much everything was excellent. And the service was also superb, very friendly and speedy.   The only gripe I had was because they had the gas apparatus integrated into the table and some kind of wooden block running along the wall; it can be uncomfortable to sit if you're with a group. We had a booth and frankly if you have more then 2 people in your party, ask for a table instead.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first Korean BBQ experience and I must admit that it has been a very pleasant one. This restaurant is a fairly new establishment with tasteful interior design and awesome customer service.   There are three standard all you can eat options and the price is very reasonable. Good place to visit with family and friends. I was there around noon and people specially families started coming in.  I'd definitely like to go back."}
{"text":"++++ CLOSED ++++  I have to award Shin Jung Korean BBQ the Best Service restaurant I been to in term of Korean restaurants!  I was actually greeted warmly when I arrive with a big smile. I was allowed to sit in a 4 person booth alone  I was asked if I want my banchan refilled I was informed by the waiter that my Soon Tofu is going arrive in a few minutes and hope I don't mind.... I was asked if I want to have my tea filled up a few times, even after I pay my bills I was always spoken with a big smile and with tons of eye contact I was asked how I like my meals and if everything is ok ** OK the waiter is young and have a nice smile too!**  Dropped by for lunch at this newly opened restaurant located in First Markham Place. The interior is nicerly decorated with big windows and high ceiling (they would need that because every table counter does have a BBQ stove)  The lunch specials have a big choice starting from $6.95 with various Korean dishes. I decided on the Soon Tofu Soup extra spicy ($7.95).  Seems like all the meals are served with glass noodles and salad and with banchans on the side. They all nicely presented and the waitstaffs explains every single thing they bring to the table. It is good for patrons that is new to Korean food.  The Soon Tofu has seafood and veggie inside.. (One big Shrimp and Mussel and some baby oysters.) The Tofu is really silky and it just slide right into my mouth. The broth is quite favoured with a hint of seafood taste.. and it is just the perfect spiciness for my taste. The rice, I wish they will have the option of brown rice as not everyone eat white rice and it is more healthy to give people that option.  PS If you don't want the egg.. please let them know, because it was cracked raw cooking in the bubbling broth when it was served  The watermelon slice that was thickly sliced and sweet make a perfect ending to the meal.  I would definitely be back to try their Cold Noodle and other Korean Fare... I hope the waitstaffs can keep up with their spirt and keep on offering excellent services to the patrions!"}
{"text":"* * * CLOSED! * * *   Oh no, looks like Shin Jung is closed for business. The phone has been disconnected and there is a letter of termination/eviction posted in the window of the restaurant.  Too bad, I wanted to try this restaurant on my birthday."}
