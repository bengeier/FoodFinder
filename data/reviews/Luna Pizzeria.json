{"text":"The pizza and souvlakis at Luna are to die for. I order from them every week. Food is amazing.and so is their service! No matter what I order, I'm always pleased! Definitely my favorite restaurant in the West Island!"}
{"text":"Never again! I had ordered a cheese and garlic pizza with ground beef, bacon and tomatoes on New Year's Eve. I love garlic but it was way too much. I was sick to the stomach on New Year's Day. They also use very inferior cheese if not real at all."}
{"text":"To be respectful...I will just say that the customer service is awful. They charge different prices than what's advertised and also hang up when you call."}
{"text":"The inside of this establishment looks like an interigation room for al queda, food eats complete ass too. If you like hair in your poutine this is the pizza place for you !"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the town and very friendly staff.  My favorite pizza place in the West Island."}
