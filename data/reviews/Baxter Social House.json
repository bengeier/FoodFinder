{"text":"If you are going for a martini or cheap beer... Good place but I would not waste your money on the food, at best I would rate it ok... The waitress greeted us with do you have any questions I can not answer. That was horrible but it matched her lack of service. Worst waitress..."}
{"text":"This place has changed names for the 3 times. The service is bad. The beer tastes stale on draft. The music was too loud when I was there. It's a shame this place could be amazing with some strong management and cleaning up."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is empty on a Friday night. My friends and I came in and we're told by the 2 bartenders that were standing around that we had to get our drinks from the girl doing table service if we were going to sit at a table. After a round of beers, the waitress didn't come to our table again until we were all empty and she had finished dancing the Wobble for the second time in 20 minutes.   When we decided to leave, again the waitress couldn't be found so I went to the bartenders, who were still doing nothing, to close out the tab. This is when I was told by a snotty little girl with stupid faux glasses behind the bar that the waitress had to close is out. After 4 different people, 2 employees and 2 people in my group, went to tell the waitress that we were ready to leave she finally brought out our bills which of course needed to be fixed multiple times. By this time, frustration led us to cut the evening short and we all went home disappointed.   Other than this experience, this has the potential to be a decent place to grab CHEAP beers and binge drink the night away. Unfortunately, you would sober up before you had the chance."}
