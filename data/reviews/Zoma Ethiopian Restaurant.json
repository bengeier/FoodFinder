{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food, and we really enjoyed it!  The staff was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"If you like Ethiopian food, you have to eat here.  If you have never had Ethiopian food, now is the time to check it out!   I am a vegetarian, and I love their food.  I would have given 5 stars, but gave only 4 stars because they did not have any Collard Green Kale - they ran out earlier before we came (it is wonderful, so I know why they ran out).  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Update: So we went back, and actually had food this time! It seems that they've figured out some of the issues with service. And the food was great. We had an appetizer of sambusa, and split the vegetarian combo for our main course. We were able to choose four items, and when the owner recognized that we were deliberating between the cabbage or green beans for our fourth choice, he brought both with our meal. We ordered a cup of coffee each at the end of dinner, which I would definitely recommend since it is absolutely delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very unique place. Naturally gluten free with plenty of veggie only dishes. Staff is very personable and efficient. The owner helps educate you on the food and traditions. All the food was good and I love the injera."}
{"text":"I was among many in my neighborhood to receive the news of an Ethiopian Restaurant opening very nearby with much elation! Finally!  And it was also with pleasure that my first visit with a friend new to Ethiopian food yielded a warm, friendly yet exotic experience. My friend loved the spices and flavors as well as the injera bread. And I found Zoma's fare to be among the best Ethiopian food I have ever had.  It was such a good experience that I scheduled a group of 12 of my husband's friends to gather and eat there for a big birthday dinner. I let the restaurant know in advance and they handled it flawlessly. Our table was waiting for us when we arrived and large platters of food brought in quick order. Zoma turned many of our party into fans, many had never had Ethiopian food before. Bravo Zoma!  We eat there now as often as possible and I am glad to have them in the neighborhood!  -Edie"}
{"text":"I lived in Ethiopia for a little bit and have been craving the food. I decided to make the drive to Cleveland to try this little spot out and I'm glad I did. Food was great and it's a cool little spot."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Vegan and gluten free options! Very quaint and adorable little spot to eat. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"So glad to have good Ethiopian in the neighborhood now! The food is great- meats were tender and the veggies were all very flavorful. Their injera/sourdough flatbread is perfectly spongey. My idea of comfort food. Our nice waitress suggested getting the Zoma special combo (includes the beef tibs, spicy beef, mild beef, spicy chicken, cottage cheese, and 5 veggies) because it was our first time there. Highly recommend! We shared between two people and it was very, very filling. Three people could definitely share. We'll definitely be coming back to Zoma soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal here with friends and family, celebrating my wife's birthday.  Don't let this small storefront shop's appearance fool you...they are cooking up some seriously wonderful in their back kitchen!  Six of us decided to share a family-style meal (our favorite thing!) in order to try as many dishes as possible.  We ordered a slew of appetizers and then several each of the meat and vegetarian main dishes.  Each of the mains came with a side and plenty of injera to sop up the various meats, veggies and sauces.  Our appetizers consisted of the sambusas and the tima fit fit.  The sambusas were stuffed with whole lentils, onions and peppers served with a spicy sweet chili dipping sauce.  The pastry exterior was crunchy and the insides warm and filling.  The tima tim fit fit consisted of chopped injera bread mixed together with herbs, onions, tomatoes and jalapenos giving it a real kick!  On the meat side of the entrees, we ordered the lamb special tibs, mild chicken stew and the quanta firfir.  The lamb had a bit of fatty pieces in it (to be expected) but was grilled nicely with peppers, onions and spices.  The mild chicken stew was the best dish on the table...slow simmered in a turmeric-laden sauce along with a boiled egg.  Absolutely delicious!  Last was the quanta firfir consisting of injera pieces mixed with dried, shredded beef and cooked in onions, herbs and spices.  good, but not our favorite dish.  On the vegetarian side, we ordered the chickpea stew which was served in a crock so hot that it literally looked like a boiling cauldron!  The chickpeas were turned into a consistency similar to refried beans and the spices added made for a unique and addictive blend of flavors.  We were so full that we did not make it all the way to the traditional coffee ceremony.  Oh well, guess we'll just have to go back! ;-)"}
{"text":"It is a great restaurant that gives you a test of Ethiopian food. I highly recommend it. The staff is nice."}
{"text":"This new restaurant was quite enjoyable. Ethiopian food without the menu being daunting to customers.  Our service was good, and I thought the interior was cute. I mean, i don't judge a place on lacking modern chrome fixtures or mason jar light bulbs or some even more impressive architectual design wonder. If you enjoy eating food in this style you will leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Good lord, what a satisfying meal.  We ordered the 32.00 combo for two and had more than enough food to keep our fluffy butts satisfied. I took no photos because I couldn't shovel in the cabbage, lentils and stews quick enough.   No fluffy words, this stuff is good. Comfort food at its finest. And my fingers will smell like it for the rest of the day, thus reminding of my excellent meal over and over."}
{"text":"First time eating Ethiopian, it did not disappoint!  Went with 5 others, we split the Zoma Special and a fish dish. Some had coffee, others had tea, everything was delicious! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We were craving some Ethiopian and in cleveland is difficult to find, so we were glad to learn that zoma opened a month ago or so. We read the reviews before going and were a bit scared by the comments on service, but we had a free evening and decided to try anyway. Well, I guess they improved a lot on service: we were immediately seated even though the place was crowded, ordered immediately and the food came in 15 minutes. We ordered sambusas and the meat/ veggie combo, asked for a substitution (an extra veggie entree instead of the spicy beef) and they accommodated us with no issues. The food was very good, the mild beef stew very tasty, and all the veggies were spiced but not too much, delicious. The only very small complain: we had the combo to feed two people, and while the food is definitely enough for one, it might be not enough for two. A little more generous portions of veggies would have helped, but I also have to say that the owner (a very kind person) asked me what I liked most and when I mentioned the stew, he brought some more at the table (without me asking or complaining about anything). The ambient is casual and relaxed, and there is a BYOB with 7$ corkage fee. We will definitely come back and try some more food!"}
{"text":"I had never tried Ethiopian food before, so Zoma was an entirely new experience for me. Which no preconceived expectations, I went into the warm and inviting restuarant with an open mind.  First off, I really appreciate that Zoma offers sample plates! I ordered the vegetarian combo, and my friend ordered the meat and vegetable combo. Both are served on bread that resembles a large pancake. We also ordered the sambusa with veggies as a starter, which actually was my favorite part of the meal. We enjoyed everything, but just a lesson from my own experience- the way the food is served caused it to cool down pretty quickly, at which point is was a lot less appealing. I'm not taking any points off for that though, because I don't consider it a fault. I just recommend you try to eat quickly :)  I understand that Zoma offers a great coffee ceremony, so I'm hoping to catch that another time! Overall, I enjoyed my meal, and the experience"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! We all left super full and satisfied, and with leftovers, yay. Great service, too. No complaints!"}
{"text":"As others have noted, the portion sizes are extremely small. The food is decent, but nowhere near as good as Empress Taytu close to downtown. The ambience of that restaurant is much better as well, whereas Zoma is one crowded room. I wanted to give them a second chance because I do love Ethiopian and the first night I went was their opening night, but the second time around was just as lackluster. The portions of actual substantive food is extremely small and instead you are given mounds of dry injera. The service is terrible as they care more about making a profit than they do about making customers happy. For example, they will not give you any more of anything. Will not be coming back for good this time!"}
{"text":"Are you ready to eat with your hands?? That's what your about to do! Almost all the dishes comes with a pancake Like roll called injera. So you tare a pice if injera and use this like a eatable utensil. All the dishes have a very different flavor to what we are used to. And I love it!  If you come here you most order coffee. Coffee is prepared in the Ethiopian way! Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Great Ethiopian food. I am glad to see this restaurant open near cedar lee area. Love their zoma combo."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland. What is also nice is that it is right down the street from Wine Spot, so you can buy a bottle of wine to drink with your meal. Zoma is BYO, though there is a corkage fee."}
{"text":"Yay Ethiopian food!! My bf has never tried it before so we decided to pay Zoma a visit. We don't have that much variety in Erie.   Parking: super easy since there is free parking after 6pm on the street. If there is ever a time where there is no parking there is a 24 hr metered parking area a block away.  Service and interior: Quick and friendly service. The place is homey with artwork on the walls, an awesome lit tree, and monitors for anyone who wants to eat in front of a tele just like some of y'all do at home. Mary Poppins was on lol.  Incense was mild. Bathroom is sorta odd...there is a halfway done bathroom without walls or doors right across from the actual finished bathroom. Ask someone if you're lost!   Food: We ordered the zoma special combo platter for 32.99. The menu said our dish would serve 2-3 people and I would have to say it's more like 3 people. My BF and I are both fatasses and we couldn't even finish it. We wanted to though because it was pretty good! The combo was a huge platter of 5 different veggie options and 4 meat items served on injera bread with 4 rolled up pieces of injera on the side. You rip up the injera bread and use it to dip or scoop up whatever you want. So yes you do eat with your hands so please wash your hands before you eat. They give you wet towelettes when you sit to make it easier for you. My bf loved the spicy beef stew, and I liked their beef tibs! Their injera is more mild and not as sour as other injera breads I have had.  I still miss Ethiopian food from LA but I'm happy there is one here in Cleveland that is pretty yummy to satisfy cravings.   Would recommend? If you live in the area and want to try something different, then yes!"}
{"text":"Super surprising, yummy hole in the wall. One of my few experiences having Ethiopian food and it was a great experience. I split the platter among friends and enjoyed tasting the different flavors of Ethiopia. The host and waiters were incredibly nice to us. Very good experience."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner on a Sunday when we were in the area and I don't regret it! First time trying Ethiopian food. We had the mixed meat and veggie platter which included mild and hot beef stew, red lentil and chickpea stew. Delicious! This place was packed for a Sunday so service was a bit slower, but the staff was very friendly and kind and we weren't in a rush so it didn't bother me. Side note- the cab sav was delicious and chilled to a perfect temperature. Would definitely come back to try more food (and wine). It would be a great place for a group as the platters are very sharable and large! Super affordable, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!! Yellow split peas are creamery and savory. The waiter was so kind and remembered who ordered which dish. It was very filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"We recently went to Zoma for dinner on a weeknight. Service was good. The food was excellent especially for us. We are mostly plant based eaters so finding vegetarian food without eggs and milk can be difficult. There were several choices. I wish that you could ask for how spicy you want your food. The chickpeas were too spicy for me but my husband loved them. The injera bread is gluten free so I look forward to bringing friends with allergies here. The only slight downside is there is no alcohol and a $10 fee to bring a bottle of wine which seems like a lot for this no frills place. I really liked the spices in the food and would recommend the kale and the red lentils. Overall a great dinner. We will be back! I'm looking forward to bringing our kids so they can experience Ethiopian food. Good luck Zoma!"}
{"text":"Good food . Friendly service . Reasonably priced and an unassuming ambiance perfect for those casual dinners ."}
{"text":"The food at Zoma is just as good or better than any Ethiopian I've eaten across the country.  The service was superb!  Our food arrived quickly after ordering. We sat at one of three basket tables for the more authentic experience.  We had mild beef, spicy beef, red lentil, and cabbage. All were outstanding, but the spicy beef and cabbage were my favorites. The Ethiopian honey wine was a nice pairing with the spicy food. Will definitely be back to this nice addition to the Lee Road dining scene.  The TVs displaying an Ethiopian channel didn't add much to a Saturday night dining experience. Might be better suited to a lunch crowd. Based on food and service alone, I would have rated this restaurant with five stars but dropped one for ambience."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it was a good experience. I like food that has a little kick to it, but I wasn't ready for this. I had a mild and spicy meat (I think it was beef), veggies, and red lentils since it was my first visit.  The injera didn't feel or taste like i thought. It was a lot softer and bland (for obvious reasons) so my first bite was a shock to the tastebuds. The portions are huge! It was like I hadn't eaten anything when I finished.  The restaurant is quaint. It has the option of traditional seating or a regular table. The service was fast and helpful. No complaints. I actually really like the spicy seasoning and would go again to try something new on the menu. I also had my first ginger beer, so it was a cultural experience for me and I learned that eating with my hands is a lot more satisfying than using utensils."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch and we're very pleased with how things went.  Service was very polite, friendly, and fast.  We shared the Zoma Sampler with an extra order of mild chicken.  Ordering this kind of arrangement will get you all of the vegetarian dishes included (about enough for all 4 guests to have several bites of each).  The seasoning was very complex and fresh and from the the handful of times I've had Ethiopian food, authentic and not tweaked for domestic tastes.  Be prepared for a lot of flavor.  All 4 of us were full at the end of the meal, but not uncomfortable.  Everyone enjoyed the food, the service, atmosphere, and end result.    A few notes.  Zoma is not priced well for lunch, just one menu for lunch and dinner.  They are very well priced for dinner.   This is not a silverware friendly restaurant, but if you feel uncomfortable eating food with your hands and injera (use your right hand), they will bring you forks/spoons."}
{"text":"This was my first Ethiopian dining experience. Overall it was great. Service was wonderful and the staff was helpful for those of us who know nothing about Ethiopian food. Food was pretty good. Not my favorite but I think that I just may not love Ethiopian. Baklava was great and the appetizer was really good. We had the sambul as an appetizer.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Sure, I'll probably get a bunch of douchebag comments about how I'm not culturally sensitive or how I just \"don't get it\" when it comes to Ethiopian cuisine. So be it. Such is the life of a Yelper and I embrace it. Besides, it's not like I'm unhappy that the wife and I stopped in to Zoma. It was an interesting experience. It expanded the mind and built new synapses and all that. It's just that, well, it was kinda underwhelming and it gave me stinky fingers. Please allow me to explain.  First things first. They were burning incense in the restaurant. Seriously. It was so overwhelming that it was burning my nose and influencing the flavor of my food. It was like eating in a head shop or a stoner's armpit. I feel like I shouldn't have to tell a restaurant owner not to burn incense, but apparently they didn't get the memo.  We love to try out new ethnic food. As we've gotten older, we find ourselves wanting to expand out eater's education more and more. That's the main reason - along with all of the ravers on here - that we chose to make the drive to our old stomping grounds to see what all the fuss was about at Zome.  The space itself isn't really anything special. It has that slightly tacky, worn feeling of a storefront that used to be a bunch of other things. I think they're doing the best with what they've got to work with, but it needs some TLC. It's clean, the big windows bring in natural light, there's that going for it, but it's also pretty small, the coffee station up front takes up a lot of space, and the tables are undersized for the way they serve the food.  There wasn't another soul in the place when we arrived but by the time we left a huge part had essentially commandeered the entire place and it was getting a bit raucous. Our server was friendly and seemed eager to help, but not all that knowledgable about the menu. He had to go into the back to consult the wizard several times. Speaking of service, here's another ding. Our order was messed up twice. We were brought out a jalapeno instead of a green pepper and they doubled up on a dish for our sampler rather than bringing us the two we had asked for.   Another thing I just don't get is the eating with your fingers thing. Yeah, I know, it's how they do it in the old country. I'm just not all that into using my hands to shovel food into my face. It's not really all that sanitary and, as mentioned earlier, it leaves your hands smelling like middle eastern spices for hours after you're done eating. Just not my thing.  Second, the portion sizes are small given the prices and simple ingredients. You'll spend most of your meal filling up on the spongy, completely flavorless \"bread\" called injera. Go ahead, tell me how the injera is \"just the vehicle\" and that the food is where the flavor is, I'll wait. Speaking of food, the portions are only about 1/2-cup each and for nearly $20 for the meat/veggie combo platter, there needs to be more. I left hungry. [insert offensive Ethiopian joke here].  OK, I'll admit. The food was pretty damn tasty. We opted for 2 combo platters so we could try 8 different dishes (ended up being only 7, see above). Filled with spices, complex yet approachable flavors - I love Indian food and this was pretty reminiscent of it. The beef stews were my favorites and my wife really liked split yellow lentils. Just about everything we ate had some level of heat, especially the sambusas, so if spicy food isn't your thing, you probably won't like it here.  The drink selection is nearly non-existent. Save for bottled water or tap water they don't have much else. You can bring in your own wine but with a massive $10 corking fee who the hell'd want to? Two words people. Iced tea.  The bright spot were the sambusas. Crispy fried pockets of lentils and peppers. I should have just ordered 6 of these for my meal. Oh well. Hindsight and all.  Everyone on here seems to be loving their coffee service, but we didn't bother. As I mentioned above, the place was incredibly loud and crowded by the end of our meal and with the missteps and less-than-satisfying meal we weren't itching to stay any longer than necessary. Another for the \"one and done\" list, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian food Cleveland has to offer. Everything is perfectly seasoned and there are plenty of vegan and vegetarian dishes to enjoy if you're not a meat eater- this is a must-visit gem! I ordered my meal to go and the food was still hot and maintained its quality even when not dining in."}
{"text":"Ethiopian food is something I recently tried for the first time out of town and I fell in love with it. I am so glad to have discovered there's a gem like Zoma so close to home. The flavors here are incredible and the portions are deceivingly huge!  The restaurant itself is charming and small with a lot of beautiful Ethiopian artwork around. Perfect to bring a small group of friends. The staff are all really friendly too.  If you order takeout, they don't begin making your meal until close to your arrival time or until after you get there for optimal freshness. I did not mind the wait for that delicious food!  I ordered the chickpea stew, which was SO delicious and smooth with a little kick of spice to it. A generous amount of injera was included, along with a little salad. They have some really good vegetarian options. Please try the Sambusa appetizer! I would place about 50 orders of that alone if I could.  Parking is a challenge on a busy weekend, but there's plenty of nearby side streets as additional parking options."}
{"text":"If you do not try this place, you will regret passing it by. Food is amazing and staff is warm and friendly. Highly recommend this to anyone that likes trying different types of foods. Flat bread that all dishes are served on is now my favorite food. Amazing job."}
{"text":"This is a great place to try something new and different. I recommend getting the combo, so you can try a little bit of everything. The condiments are rich, and even the way you're supposed to eat it is unusual, so if you're too set in your ways, you'll probably not like it.  This place delivers; however, this kind of food doesn't really travel well. Anyway, it's better to go to the place , so you can try the coffee. YOU MUST GET THE COFFE! It's an experience."}
{"text":"One should definitely try this restaurant! Amazing Ethiopian food.. just loved it. I would like to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I was unsure about Ethiopian before, but I have been back several times and lived it each time. Their hot tea is addictive. I am a total carnivore, but their chick pea dishes are one of my favorite foods. Get a sampler with a friend, be sure to try the spicy foods as well!"}
{"text":"I love exotic foods. I get bored easily and need the variety and this place has it. I ate a ton of Ethiopian food in college, since my roommate was dating an Ethiopian guy and one of my good friends was from Ethiopia herself. The food is fresh, spicy, and delectably flavored. Try it out. They have lunch specials too."}
{"text":"I'll finish this review later, but I want everyone to know that the Kitfo dish is beef tartare, AKA raw meat. The menu does not say this and the waiter did not mention it either even though he knew this was our first time eating Ethiopian food; I thought it was red because it had a lot of red spices in it! I brought the leftovers for lunch and had it sitting out on my desk all morning so we'll see if I die tonight. (I'll probably be fine, I've got an ironclad stomach, if not, someone needs to adopt my cat).  I mean, my bad for not doing my research beforehand, some people do enjoy eating under-cooked meat, but maybe disclosing on the menu that your ground beef is not cooked would be helpful information for consumers? Maybe ask if/how I want the meat cooked?  AHhhh I should have known by the mushy texture!   Well, at least I'll die doing what I loved: eating.   **Update: Chris R. from Bedford was unhappy with my review and sent me a message telling me to ask next time I'm at a restaurant if the meat in a dish is raw. I may be a bit rusty on my Ohio Uniform Food Safety Codes, but I'm pretty sure consumer advisories are required and must consist of a disclosure and a reminder if under-cooked food products will be served at a restaurant (check paragraph E of rule 3717-1-03.5 of the Administration Code). So that means the product needs to be fully described in the menu section and the health risks associated with consuming raw or under-cooked products needs to be listed as well. If Chris has further questions he can contact his local health department.   (Nothing wrong with serving under-cooked products, just have to let people know so they can make an educated decision on whether to consume that dish or not.)"}
{"text":"First time trying Ethiopian food, I was amazed at how good the food and atmosphere was, the staff was very welcoming and friendly,they even showed us the tradyional way of eating without utensils, I would highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and stopping in to try Zoma, It was delightful. Was first but not last time I visit an Ethiopian resturuant!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten Ethiopian food a couple of times in Cleveland and a couple of times in Washington D.C. and Zoma is as good as I have had.  Even though Zoma recently opened, they managed to handle a party of 9 Yelpers on a week night when they were pretty busy.   Located in the Cedar Lee area, Zoma has done a nice job of creating an inviting spot out of a couple of storefronts.  The compact dining room has conventional tables plus 4 of the basket tables that are traditional for Ethiopian food.  They have also carved out an area by the window for the coffee ceremony; where they fresh roast beans right in front of you filling the room with smoke and great smells.  Decor, while not as extensive as some places is sufficient to transport you to a more exotic location.  The menu is divided into meat and vegetarian, with a single fish dish, there are also a number of combination plates.  Descriptions are a bit light on details, but the server was happy to take time to explain things and make suggestions.  Service is casual and our server did an excellent job, friendly, informative and enthusiastic.    I ordered the 4 item vegetable combination with red split lentils, chopped kale, Fasolia Tibs and cabbage all served on injera bread.  First the injera is a large buckwheat spongy bread which you tear and use to eat the dishes with your hands; Zoma's injera is thin with a light nutty and tangy taste, it can be a bit addictive.  Overall the vegetarian dishes were very good; the red split lentils have a bit of a kick and a hint of garlic, the Fasolia Tibs is sauteed green beans and carrots, the cabbage also has carrots and a nice garlic flavor, the chopped kale was tender and mild.  I also tried the tomato salad which is chopped tomatoes with jalapenos and onions to make a refreshing contrast.    Prices are good, service was excellent and the food was what I expect from an Ethiopian restaurant, hopefully Zoma will thrive and be around for a long time.  Head to Cleveland Heights for a great experience."}
{"text":"The owner was kind enough to let me get take out from the buffet that was available for the grand opening weekend. I really enjoyed sampling the variety of dishes. Looking forward to many visits in the future!!"}
{"text":"A unique CLE dining experience! Zoma has so so food in my book and they have pretty slow service for how small of a restaurant it is, but it's definitely something you're not finding at many other CLE joints. I would recommend the lentils if you're making a stop--I've tried basically all the options: chicken, beef, split peas etc. They also have a ton of other vegetarian options, which is great! One of my vegetarian friends is there all the time!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Ethiopian food. Went here for a dinner with some friends and it was a great decision. If you go on Saturday night, make sure you call in and make a reservation.(gets busy). This time around I ordered the Zoma special combo and I shared with one other person. (More than enough food for 2 people). For an appetizer I got the sambusas which  were pretty good as well. The main course, served on top injera bread of course, had a very good selection. My favorites were the spicy beef stew and the cabbage. The waitstaff were very attentive and great service was offered. I will say for the amount of food we received , it was bit expensive though. Overall I would visit this restaurant again in the future!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good vegetarian/vegan options, and friendly service. They offer a very reasonable corkage fee of you want to bring in beer or wine (they don't sell alcohol themselves, but the Wine Spot is right across the street with a wide array of retail options)."}
{"text":"Came here a week ago.   FYI there is no liquor license. They permit you to bring wine only. Repeat Wine only, and there is a modest 7$ corking fee.  Service was very attentive. Water glasses were always filled  I ordered the combination platter. It was sufficient for 2 people.  I thought the food was OK kind of on the bland side. The beef stew was a bit on the tougher side, the lentils were OK but lacking that punch of flavor I was expecting. I may come back, but I'm not in a hurry. The person I was with agreed that the food was a bit bland."}
{"text":"Very good!  The server was very friendly.  I highly recommend the coffee and the Ethiopian honey wine. Gluten free injera was a plus as well."}
{"text":"For starters, this restaurant has great flavor and this review is based on this one experience my family had while visiting here.  While in the area, my wife, in-laws, and I were trying to figure out what would be great for dinner. Zoma appeared in Yelp and I was tickled to see there was an Ethiopian place walking distance from where we were at. My wife and I live in Los Angeles, CA, and there's an area there called \"Little Ethiopia\" filled with restaurants I'd frequent. I've been trying to get my wife to go with me for some time. Her very first Ethiopian experience was here at Zoma.  We went in to get a table and the place was packed. We were told by a gentleman that they were in fact packed and it'd probably be about 10 minutes until a table opened up. We were all very hungry, but were totally okay with a 10 minute wait. They offered to collect our phone number to let us know when a table opened up.  So we went across the street to The Wine Spot for a beer. 20 minutes goes by and we'd heard nothing. So we closed our tab and walked back to find that there were new customers seated in tables not previously marked as reserved, but other tables still marked as reserved. So we had to raise a moderate amount of hell. They explained to us that these were reservations and we countered that the tables people were sitting at weren't previously marked reserved. The server we locked horns with said we'd have to take it up with his boss. The boss came over, gave the same reasoning, apologized, and sat us down at a table marked as reserved. We were immediate met by a gentlemen who let us know it was his first day on the job. He was very humble and nice, but didn't know the details of the establishment yet. So we put in some appetizers and ordered our beverages.  The appetizers took an average amount of time to get to the table. I was surprised to learn that Zoma doesn't do sen'na bert (hand-washing ceremony) at the table I've been part of in every other Ethiopian restaurant. They do have a hand-washing sink towards the restroom if you require such a thing (which I recommend considering it's communal finger food).  The food came shortly after and the server wasn't able to tell us which was which and said he'd need to bring someone else out to tell us about our food. So a minute later the first server we conflicted with came out (very friendly with a smile) and explained what we were eating.   They also stocked us up with a healthy supply of injera to keep eating. It was delicious.  We are well, and felt full afterwards. The only reason we gave it 3 stars is how we were handled leading up to being seated and that we were given a new employee to take care of us instead of a seasoned person familiar with the restaurant. But we'd probably eat here again while in the area. If so and the service improves, I'll change my response.  ***UPDATE (03/23/2017): I just received a message from the owner. It's very clear the owner genuinely cares very much about the experience of their customers. As a former small business owner myself, I totally understand where he's coming from. It is a very small restaurant and the tables can fill quickly. As the only Ethiopian restaurant in the area, the influx of customers is probably very unpredictable in such a small restaurant so it's advised to make reservations if you're able to. As I said before, the quality of food is wonderful. I'm sure our next experience will be vastly better. I've added a star due to the sheer nature of the concern and outreach the owner demonstrated. That goes a long long way.**"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland for a work conference and found this place online.  The food was quite good, service was a bit slow.  If you are not in a big hurry I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of leaving 3 stars. However, this place definitely qualifies. We wanted to try something different and we love Ethiopian food. We went in and were asked to sit and wait for a table, so we did. A couple came in about 10 minutes after us and were seated before we were. I got up and said we were going to leave and the gentleman behind the counter said no, we have your table ready. We ended up having to wait an additional 5 minutes.  Once we sat down, we ordered and the food took about 5 minutes. The food itself was delicious.  We ate and ordered the coffee ritual, which is a pot of coffee. After our meal, we literally waiting 25 minutes before I asked them for our coffee and then they gave us a shot glass of coffee each, after we ordered a pot of coffee. We drank it and had to wait another 25 minutes for our check.  The service was absolutely terrible!! For a small restaurant, they were incredibly busy and they only had 2 people working. No one was at the door, so people that were coming in to eat were just sitting down and the people that were waiting to be seated were just waiting. It was very unorganized. Like I said, the food was delicious but the service was terrible. I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Zoma.  Friendly service, prompt service of food, good value.  We are 4 serious foodies who travel internationally quite a bit so like to try different ethnic foods.  We got the family combo platter for our meal and the samosa type starters, along with the traditional Ethiopian honey wine (slightly sweet but appropriate to the food)Plenty of food along with the injera.  Nice variety of spices, not too hot.  Decor is simple but obviously proudly Ethiopian.  Only negative was the incense burning.  Fairly subtle but a little intrusive at first."}
{"text":"A great find in Cleveland Heights. We are used to great Ethiopian food in Boston so we were excited to find this place right up the street. We've been twice, including most recently with our adventurous 12 year old niece, and had a great time! The place is always busy on the weekends though we didn't have to wait.  We shared the Zoma Special Combo, which was more than enough food for the three of us, and a great way to get a taste of everything on the menu. Everything was delicious, the spicy beef was nicely spicy, the veggie dishes were great. The prices are very reasonable, and the bottles of wine are a steal! Try the Ethiopian honey wine!"}
{"text":"When I lived in D.C., I loved getting Ethiopian food. Admittedly, this was my first time getting Ethiopian in Cleveland! I went with a group of Yelp friends and had a great time.  I had the mild chicken stew, which is served with injera and a house salad (not a real salad, more of a zesty tomato salsa). Injera is a thicker, sourdough type bread that you use to pick up bites from your entree. The portion of injera was very generous, and they even put extra on the table. I enjoyed the more sour taste to this injera, as it wasn't bland at all. The mild chicken stew, thought advertised as mild, still had a little kick to it and was cooked with egg. Overall, I was undoubtedly full and happy with my choices. My meal felt really authentic and comparable to the restaurants I would frequent in D.C.  The highlight of Zoma is really the beautiful set-up they have to recreate a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony. I'm not familiar with the exact cultural descriptions, but they have a lovely area set-up specifically for this ceremony that is built out of a live indoor tree. Once the ceremony is live in action, the restaurant fills with a smoky haze and delightful smells.   Other observations: you really can't beat the prices here, especially for the portions and experience. Also, if you have a food allergy or restriction, you may want to ask quite a few questions, because I recall the menu descriptions being a little short.   Bottom line: super authentic and enjoyable for adventurous eaters. Choose carefully on the menu!"}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful food in a friendly, clean environment. The wait staff was informative & knowledgeable which is very helpful because it was the first time eating Ethiopian food for my son. The vegetarian selection is stellar. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first time having Ethiopian food, and it was quite the experience! I like how the restaurant tried to keep it authentic, and did not provide us any silverware other than for the coffee and tea. My friend and I were expected to use the injera bread to pick up the various stews and dishes, and we thoroughly enjoyed how the soft, spongy injera bread absorbed all the flavors of the dishes. My friend and I split the Zoma Special Combo, which came with beef tibs, spicy beef stew, mild beef stew, and 5 other vegetarian dishes. The spicy beef and cabbage were particularly good, while my friend loved the beef tibs. As for drinks, I got the Ethiopian tea whereas my friend got the Ethiopian coffee. The tea was very minty, and did not require any additional sugar. My friend loved the richness of the coffee, though it was way too black for me personally.  I love how the decorum is very traditional Ethiopian, right down to the tables we sat at. It was an excellent experience, and I would not mind returning in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I just finished a delicious, filling lunch.  This is a family-run business and the love comes through in the food and service.  If you are not familiar with Ethiopian cuisine, prepare yourself for a cultural experience!  Finish off your meal with a cup or two if the Yirgacheffe coffee."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken as expected was spicy and delicious ! I got the food to go and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Wat a meal (couldn't resist a pun; I hope it didn't injera your sensibilities). The food is as tasty as my jokes are bad. We sampled a variety of veggie and meat dishes. This is a great choice for vegetarians, as they show a lot of love to greens and beans, jamming them with complex flavors and delivering great texture. The meats are stewed, tender and delicious too. Ethiopian food is inherently intimate because you eat with your hands, using the chewy, soft injera bread as your utensil. This little storefront is not big on atmosphere, but it's huge on flavor."}
{"text":"We went there on their first day and were thoroughly impressed. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and clean.  Although I have not been to a lot of Ethiopian restaurants, I have been to a few in larger cities on the east coast, and the food here was at least as good as it was at those, if not better.  On the day we went they had a buffet - very smart move for a newly opened restaurant to make sure things go smoothly!    My favorite dishes were the Spicy Beef Stew(Key Wot) which is very tender chopped beef simmered in a medium hot and thick bereber sauce with herbal butter and exotic spices, the Gomen, which is chopped collard greens steamed with garlic, jalapeno pepper and traditional spices, and the Carrot, Potato and Fosoliya. which was strips of carrots and potatoes, and green beans with tomatoes and onion seasoned with garlic, ginger and turmeric.  That being said, everything else was delicious too!     The coffee is amazing - highly recommended - and they even roast their own beans in house!  This is what coffee is supposed to taste like, not the over roasted, burnt swill they serve at Starbucks.  I never drink coffee black, but this coffee is so good you can drink it without sugar or milk!  The service was great too, everyone was very friendly and quick to bring out drinks and extra napkins.  This is a great family run business and a wonderful addition to Cleveland Heights, so be sure to come check it out and support this new gem in the Cedar-Lee District!"}
{"text":"I truly didn't know what to expect in coming here. This is a cuisine i have never come across. So with nothing to compare it to here goes my review. 1. Location is convenient, with a parking lot across the street, the place itself has an interesting decor. When they started to make coffee though the place quickly filled with and intense smelling smoke from the roasting of the coffee beans.  2. Service. Other then the waiter having issue with one of the people we were with wanting just baklava and no coffee, the service was standard. Water was refilled regularly, napkins provided(you eat with you hands which can be fun) The owner came by a few times making sure we were taken care of, that is always a good sign when the owners are invested.  3. Food... Now the waiter really talked up the bread they use,  called injera. To describe it looks like a giant pancake with a crepe consistency. Made of buckwheat and another ingredient, it was served cold and honestly was disappointed with it, it had a very bland taste and not at all what i expected.. My wife and i both had the gored gored.. The flavor was very powerful, with spices that i cant describe as i dont think ive ever had them... I cant tell you it was good or bad because im still not sure. I would eat it again if it was in front of me, but i dont see myself searching it out if that make sense. Glad i experienced it, not sure i can say we will rush back though"}
{"text":"After living in NYC for several years and being spoiled by the abundance of ethnic cuisines there, I thought I would NEVER find decent Ethiopian food here in Cleveland. But then Zoma - sweet, sweet Zoma - entered my life, sweeping me off my feet and proving me wrong!   The restaurant is conveniently located in the Cedar Lee District of Cleveland Heights - just a three-minute walk away from the Cedar Lee movie theater.   Do not be dissuaded by Zoma's storefront. Yes, it's pretty plain from the outside... it even has a small, plain interior. But to hell with the ambiance! You have to experience the food!  If you've never had Ethiopian before, the waitstaff was extremely friendly and seemed eager to explain the menu and culture. When we first sat down, our waiter immediately asked if this was our \"first time\" ... Understandable, since it might be jarring for first-timers to use their hands and fingers as their only utensils.  We ordered the sambusas as a starter - which are basically lentils and jalapenos wrapped up in a triangular dumpling. These were absolutely delicious! Just a warning, though - the menu is a bit deceiving. The image next to the sambusa appetizer looks like a bowl filled with dozens of small bite-sized dumplings. When the dish came out, it was actually only two, palm-sized sambusas.   For dinner, we split the Meat + Veggie Platter which was definitely enough to split between two people. For the under $20 price-point, this entree was incredibly satisfying to both our wallets and tastebuds. It comes with injera bread, spicy beef stew, mild beef stew, and two veggies (we chose chickpeas + red lentils). The chickpeas and spicy beef stew were my favorites - spiced to perfection! The food was quite-literally finger-licking good. We wiped our plate clean! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"While exploring Cleveland Heights' Lee Rd with all the cute restaurants, bars, cafes, etc, I would pass by this ethiopian restaurant. I've had ethiopian in the past in la and minneapolis and i thoroughly enjoy the cuisine.  When I saw that an UYE was happening at Zoma, I immediately RSVP'ed. It was also a chance for me to make some new friends in cleveland before i leave this city next week.  I ordered: Samusa(2pieces) 3.50 - 4 stars yummy yummy nom nom nom it almost seems like a fusion of indian samosa and an outer crust like an eggroll  Zoma Special Tib - chicken 15.99 - 4 stars I was expecting more of a stew but it wasn't but the dish was still tasty. see picture. it came out in a pan with a separate dish with injera and house salad (which is served first). house salad was more of a tomato salad but this was quite exquisite and one of my favorite parts of the meal.  Injera bread is made of teff flour and is gluten free. it looks like a large pancake/crepe but has a sourdough bread taste. It is oddly addicting and also fun to pick up your food with injera bread.   Couple people from our table ordered Ethiopian coffee ceremony thingie. They roasted the beans inside the restaurant where you can sit and watch. The aroma was perfect after a meal. Although I didn't have the coffee, it looked fun and interesting to try next time.  Zoma was definitely a special experience, a fun one at that especially with a group of people. I highly recommend giving this cute place a shot!  TIP: street parking may be difficult to find. there is a 24/7 metered parking lot behind the building across the street (which may also be full depending on the time and day)"}
{"text":"Tasty cuisine for those who know and like Ethiopian.  They are still figuring some things out as far as \"restaurant operations\" go, but at the core of it, you'll still get a good meal made and served by thoughtful people.   If I had to choose between that and things like impeccable decor, then you'd find me back at Zoma.  I hope that more restaurants come to the area which feature foods of different cultures."}
{"text":"My wife and I are Dallas transplants to Cle, and the only 2 things I've really missed are the diverse Mexican/South American restaurants, and access to a lot of good Ethiopian cuisine.  Well, Zoma has provided me a solution to at least one of those problems! Zoma is in a fantastic location with friendly staff.  They have some of the best kit fo I have ever had. If you're feeling adventurous or happen to know you'll like raw steak, go for it! You shan't be disappointed.   (Keep in mind the long waits and need for reservations due to the small amount of seating space.)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service. They brought us out different things to try at no cost. Our server talked to us about traditional Ethiopian food and was very nice."}
{"text":"I went here for my first ever Ethiopian dinner, and overall I enjoyed the food. We had the sampler dinner for two (forgot what it was called), and each of the dishes had a distinct flavor and was cooked well. I had heard about the special flat bread (again, don't know the name), so I knew going in that I wouldn't be using utensils. This soon became a messy endeavor, but pretty fun too. For me, however, the taste and texture of the flat bread (sort of like a super-spongy pancake) would probably lead me to choosing many other types of restaurants before going back for Ethiopian again. It almost ruins the otherwise delicious dishes; honestly I'd rather have dived in with a fork and knife.  The service was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is pretty low key but pleasant enough. This place is worth a try, but I don't think we'll be back that soon."}
{"text":"First time ever having Ethiopian food. I have noting to compare it too.   However, the staff, amazingly accommodating. Friendly, explained what things were.  I was very apprehensive going into it as I am not one for spicy food. However, this was not bad at all.   We got both appetizers, both.....awesome.  Dinner I got the mild beef stew with \"salad\". The salad was basically pico you would get at a Mexican place. Nothing short of excellent. The bread was to say the least, different. We learned how it made and what it made from. Healthy & great.   For those that think they don't offer silverware, they do. But I didn't really need it. Our group I feel loved the whole night. I know that at least 2 of us will be back, soon.   4 stars only because parking sucks in the area and having to rush to a meter 3 blocks away, not fun."}
{"text":"first time trying ethiopian food. It is surprisingly good!!! we had two baskets of injera and a whole plate of food.... combo is the best choice if u have selection phobia like usim about to burst"}
{"text":"Delicious Ethiopian food and very nice staff. Foods range from mild to spicy which is great so everyone can enjoy. Flavorful and tender meats, great veggies. Cute decor and amazing Ethiopian music videos playing. Haven't done the coffee ceremony yet!"}
{"text":"I went there on a date...needless to say there are only 2 Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland...2!!!!! (I guess we are not gentrifying fast enough)...Anyway, portions are small and over priced. I asked the cook to make the the tibs hot..since our first order was not hot at all...he came back with the hot spices in a little cup for me to add in..Come on man cook it in the food this hot is not HOT at all... By the way I am Ethiopian but he probably thought I was some American who was afraid of hot stuff and would need 911....come on man be authentic."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. Tasty food prepared with love. I will return. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"No reservations needed on a Friday evening - there were plenty of seats open, though the restaurant wasn't empty.   When the server learned it was our first time in she recommended The Zoma Combo. This is a sampler dish and is the thing to get and share for first time visitors. It is served w/ 5 of the 6 vegetable options: split red lentils (spicy), split yellow lentils, collard greens, chickpea stew, green beans and carrots, and cabbage; homemade cottage cheese; \"salad;\" and 4 meets: beef tibs, beef stew (spicy - very), beef stew (mild), and chicken stew.   Each of the items were very flavorful. They all contained recognizable whole foods and ingredients, but were flavorful in a way that each was unique and delicious.   The food is all served on injera (bread) and additional injera is provided to scoop up the food since not using utensils is the norm. Additional bread, though not mentioned at the time by the server, is $2.    For drinks the wine menu is short, but it doesn't matter because the Honey Wine should be your order hands down. It's sweet, served chilled and is very refreshing. They also have red options: a Cab and a Merlot....the later of which was served chilled as well....hmm...   All in all a fun experience. The music is ethnic and was enjoyable. The decor is themed as well and was all part of the atmosphere. Definitely recommend giving this place a try. I can actually see myself getting a taste for some of this seemingly healthy food."}
{"text":"My first time eating Ethiopian food and I was completely AMAZED! Great vegan/vegetarian selection, healthy, and fresh! Price was great, staff was very friendly and welcoming, the food was super delicious! 5 stars easily!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a choice in Ethiopian restaurants here in Cleveland. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. Zoma has a larger selection of entree choices. I enjoyed the tea as well as the mild chicken stew. I ordered the yellow split peas as my side and an extra side of the cabbage. The mild chicken stew was delicious. I loved the flavor. A friend ordered the vegetarian combo with all six entrees and I was able to try some of them. I enjoyed the collard greens a lot and the beans and carrots had a nice flavor as well. Although Zoma has a wider selection of tibs (which is my favorite) they don't offer mushroom or shrimp tibs. And I am addicted to Empress Taytu's tikil gomen, which Zoma does not have. It will be nice to go to both places.  We were a table of 10 on a bitterly cold Wednesday night. Everyone enjoyed their meals a lot. The service could still use a little polishing (and they could use more credit card folders), but they just opened. I try to give restaurants about a month to smooth things out. I was so excited about this place that I couldn't wait a month. In the end the only thing that matters is the food, which was great. If you enjoy lingering over dinner you'll enjoy yourself. Be sure to allow yourself a couple hours on the meter or park for free on Meadowbrook."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience. Nice environment with traditional seating one side and Ethiopian music playing. Excellent service and even though I went with Ethiopian women who knew what to order... it was apparent the staff was happy to explain and make suggestions. The food was delicious and it was a great experience"}
{"text":"Injera not made with 100% teff. Made with barley, not good for gluten free. Wish it was 100% teff."}
