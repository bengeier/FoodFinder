{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews,but what a disaster under new ownership.  Food quality is great and was pleasantly surprised,which is the only thing that will save this place.  I waited 10 mins for a beer and to be awknowleged as I knew I should order food right then as I could tell this was going to be a bad experience ...buffalo chicken wrap and breaded mushrooms were on point and would tell anyone to order them  ...but service was a 1 out of 10 and this is what is going to destroy your business ...4 bartenders not attending the bar a gentleman 3 seats down waving a flashlight to get your attention and watching huge over poured shots at least 4 oz to customers ..wow!!! As the bartenders are in the corner fixing each others hair ..do your job and maybe you will make more money ..very unprofessional!!!  Sitting calmly with no reaction as they barback shoving his finger up his nose as he washes draft glasses ....come on..really?  Also clean your draft lines so the fruit flies arent your only customers ..put a fan at night at the bar ..they will be gone in 2 days as they can't bred with air movement ...I give this place 3 months before its sold again ...Shenanigans is just that...SHENANIGANS...shame on you!!!"}
{"text":"K2~ the much roomier version of the original Lakewood staple bar, Kenilworth. The food and service were excellent. Greeted immediately by the bartender. She promptly got my drink and explained the specials of the day that included the Donut Burger (exactly as you are imagining). However, I opted for the healthier buffalo grilled chicken wrap. It was delivered within 8 minutes and was fresh and hot.  Loved the fries ~ perfect for vinegar. Overall excellent experience.   A quick note about the restrooms - if you have ever been in the Lakewood KW, you know they are cramped and, well, cramped. That is NOT the case at K2. Huge, clean and adorned with tv's."}
{"text":"All down hill. This place has so much potential but a huge lack of ownership. Disappointing to say the least"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Beer is beer but the selection was weak. Also, they don't pay out on their Keno. They suggest cashing in at Drug Mart down the road. As finance is my career, I can only assume they have cashflow problems. Why else would you offer Keno and not pay out on it. It was for this reason alone I will not go back. Oh, and the bartender basically ignored us while shmoozing up with the regulars."}
{"text":"Not much from the outside.  The place is a dive, but the food and service were excellent.  We had the wings as an appetizer and the wife and kids enjoyed the tacos for 1.50 each.  Much larger than we imagined for the price. I had the mushroom burger and at 7.50 with fries, was a real deal.  The burger was cooked medium and had a great taste.  The fries were awesome.    Will be back soon since they run specials every night of the week and weekends too."}
{"text":"Average food. Average location. Average drink options. \"Regulars\" are somewhat obnoxious and the staff seems to focus on them vs. those that are first timers. Original Kenilworth is waaaaaaay better."}
{"text":"First, NOBODY in the place. Not a good sign. Second, how does one run out of chicken wings on Wing Night? And finally, how is service that slow when 5 people are in your bar?   I dont know what to say about it. Huge place, nice inside,  but sloooooow service. Food was decent once we got it but nothing special. I dont see the place lasting another year. Get with the program and get a website and a Facebook page. I do not understand in this day and age how new businesses expect to succeed and not have an online presence.   Its a shame too.......they probably could pull in a great business if they would look like they gave a crap."}
{"text":"Not good for lunch. Bugs everywhere on the window sills. More of a night club atmosphere."}
