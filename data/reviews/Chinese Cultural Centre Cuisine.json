{"text":"By far the BEST ginger beef I've ever eaten!  It actually tasted like ginger! Go figure!!!

I went with a friend for the lunch buffet and it was reasonably priced (about $12 per person).  

The restaurant was very clean and the food was hot and fresh, being replentished by the kitchen many times during out brief stay.

They served sushi, classic chinese foods, sweet and sour soup and a wide variety of desserts.

The staff were very friendly and the owner took the time to come talk to us about the dim sum and shabu shabu meals they put on.  Cant wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Bummer In The Summer! - The AYCE dim sum for $10.99 is no more! It was a nice respite from all the overpriced dim sum restos in the Chinahood. Unless you're eating at Dick Lee's in San Fran, you're not going to get decent, cheaper, and SAFER (I'm looking your way Dick Lee's) dim sum like this. Will have fond gastronomical memories of the Har Gow and Rice Crepes; farewell AYCE Cultural Centre!"}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed until my uncle had to relocate his wedding reception to here due to the flood.

They were pretty accommodating for the most part considering a last minute change. I say pretty accommodating because I thought it was weird that even with a 200+ guest event, they still kept the back dining area open so we had randoms walking past our seating area throughout the evening.

We had the traditional 10 course dinner which was catered by the restaurant. The food was ok, nothing too amazing. Some dishes (like the seafood soup and fried rice) were bland, but nothing a little soy sauce couldn't fix.

I think it's hard to judge a restaurant when it's a large event they're catering. I think I'd be up for having dinner here to see what they really have to offer."}
{"text":"There are many things to like about this restaurant, which I was lucky enough to visit for Sunday morning dim sum. The decor really works. Red pillars and gold Chinese patterns line the interior. The place is very clean, including the staff. The staff are very professional and friendly. The price is pretty reasonable (paid about $12/person). And it even has a few TVs in the place, which came in handy watching the Sunday morning football game. 

However, what puts this place over the top is the food. It tasted fresh, was delicious and even, dare I say it, was well presented and had the right textures. The dumpling whites were snow white and fluffy, the dumpling yellows were golden, the spring rolls had that perfect juicy-crispy texture to it.  My sense is someone is paying attention to the quality of the food here. It's one of the few places I've been to where the food looks as good as it tastes. A remarkable feat, hats off!

There is no cart service here, which takes away from the all important  visual dim sum experience. However, this may be a place where I don't need  see the product before purchase. A first for me ever in a dim sum place.

I know this place has undergone renovations and new ownership, perhaps they are looking to impress. Will be back to see if the quality still persists over time. If they continue this, I'm going to have to up them to five stars!"}
{"text":"We ordered peking duck, garlic stir fry snow pea leaves, braised pork belly, salt & pepper pork chop and stir fry chicken and green beans. Flavour is good...plates were big. The peking duck is small, which sucks. It is pretty good but not the best Chinese food i ever had."}
{"text":"It's a strange feeling coming back to places I haven't visited since my childhood. To think that all the years I've lived in Calgary, i'd have covered every landmark at least twice.

But when I set foot into CCCR, I instantly remembered the few times I went here during my elementary field trips. I remembered being bored by the Tera Cotta Soldier (b/c I realized they were replicas) and being blown away by ancient Chinese Weaponry. And I certainly remembered eating Chinese food at the CCCR. I wasn't a picky eater when I was a kid, but I clung onto favourites with a \"GIME GIMME!\" mindset. Chow mein, steamed brocoli in strange sauces, and ginger beef.

Hmmm Ginger Beef.

Lo and behold, I walked in here looking forward to an all you can eat hot pot, but unfortunately they didn't serve it in the warm season. So we settled for ordering off the menu. But it was rarely settling at all, the classic dishes like ginger beef and won ton soup were done well. And their all you can eat dessert bar offered items I've never tried before. The white fungus in syrup dish brought out the inner child and it's adventurous spirit. Now I have something to brag about to people whenever conversation arises.

\"You ate what? No no you stupid fool, I've had white fungus in syrup before. You know nothing\"

And that's why I have a large collection of friends."}
{"text":"This isn't the best hotpot I've ever had, but for the price, it is a fantastic option in Calgary.
Nice large oysters, tons of meat and seafood options, vegetables, dumplings and broth options. Service is efficient. I think if you are careful with the sauce, it's a pretty healthy meal. I didn't feel like I consumed any MSG after eating a very hearty meal. I went with safe choices - tofu and chicken and a beef satay broth.
Price is cheaper now- I think its $17.99 for weekdays and $19.99 for dinner.
I organized a party for 40 - we had a blast. James, the GM, did a fantastic job ensuring the vegetarians received a purely vegetarian broth. I would totally recommend booking a party with him. He is very patient and professional.
Can't wait to try their dim sum or regular Chinese food. I've been there a few times since my first visit - the food is still great. The restaurant is jam packed - so busy now but the servers work really hard to accommodate everyone. James and the regular staff recognize old customers and make the point of saying hello. The non hot pot food looks great - quite a lot of families order off the regular menu. I'll update my review once I try it."}
{"text":"We went for \"Chinese Hot Pot,\" which is essentially fondue but with flavored broth instead of oil.

I'll tell you, if you're not used to being the minority in Calgary, go here for a healthy dose of minority report! It was nice to be that way for a change!

The food was good, the broths were good, and eating takes a looooong time as you're cooking it all in small portions. The hot pot \"all you can eat\" was pretty pricy for us at $25, so make sure you're good and hungry, or that it's a special occasion, before going. I see another review says $18. Perhaps we had a higher price because it was New Year's Eve.

We got a special tour and orientation though, as we clearly had no idea what we were doing. Fun experience all around!"}
{"text":"What an absolute bar-goon!

I went there for lunch with approximately 10 people for lunch.  It was a friend's birthday and we all gathered here to raise a won-ton to Kim. :)

The buffet was small in size co  mpared to Regency Palace (as an example), but the food choices were awesome!  They had dim sum (which I avoided - its not my thing) but the chinese buffet was amazing!  The ginger beef, arguably, is the best I have had in this city.  It was cooked to perfection!  The standard chinese fare was available and all tasty.

The group i was with was all over the Dim Sum and every one was happy with the results.  

What was most impressive was the price!  The buffet was only $10.95.  You heard it - only $10.95!  I can barely get out of a food court for that price.  An all you can eat buffet is a fantastic deal, especially when the food is great!

So why not four stars?  My only complaint (which is inconsequential to me going back), is that the lineups are insane.  It makes sense, since the prices are fair and the food is good.  However, the one small buffet table is not very efficient for the size of the restaurant.  So go in hungry - not starving, because you will be in a lineup for your grub.  And it moves slow.  Once you get your food though, the world is right.

The staff are friendly and helpful as well.  Everyone I interacted with - the bus boys, the serving staff and the nice dude that you pay on the way out, were all friendly, smiley individuals.

I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for AYCE hot pot during dinner and for weekend dimsum.  For hot pot, the selection is fairly good with different types of meats, tofu, fish balls and veggies.  There's different types of broths so there's something for everyone, including a dessert spread, which isn't good or impressive but I'm not there for the dessert, really.  For dimsum, the food is fine - nothing mind blowing but fairly decent. I'm from Vancouver where the dimsum is generally excellent so my standards are high and I haven't had dimsum in Calgary that I found to be on par with Vancouver restaurants.  The dimsum here is generally on par with other places in Calgary.  A plus is that you dont need to wait for a table here as it's quite large and never that busy (which is rare for a Chinese restaurant!)."}
{"text":"What lies beneath the main floor of the Chinese Cultural Centre here in Calgary? Why, it's a restaurant. In fact, it's a CHINESE food restaurant. Go figure! I know what you're thinking, it was a restaurant once before too. The difference? It's under new ownership.

The Chinese Cultural Centre restaurant may be in a basement, but the space itself is bright and cheery. Red and white are the main colours, with a variety of different pieces adorning the walls. One flat screen tv played kids cartoons while the other across the room was set to the football game. Behind a sliding red and white door there was a banquet room ideal for private functions.

We arrived at 1030 for brunch on a Sunday and did not have an issue getting a table for our party of 6. But by the time we left after noon, it appeared that this restaurant was a popular spot for dim sum.

The food was mighty tasty. Dumplings, steamed buns, tripe, rolls, it all agreed with my belly quite nicely (ok, I didn't actually eat the tripe). Six of us ate for just shy of $60 + tip. Not bad for a dim sum brunch I must say.

The service was above par. Our teapot was replaced a couple of times without us having to ask, the food came out at regular intervals, and the servers were on top of things. The only issue we had was when we asked for another order form. I don't think the woman we spoke to understood what it was we were asking for.

There's no cart service here, but that shouldn't stop you from trying out their dim sum. I know I'll be back.

Four yums up!"}
{"text":"Had Dim sum today.... it was my first time having dim sum here, but others who had come here before said that the quality has gone downhill. 

Basic dim sum fare. 
Gone are the days of ladies pushing carts and shouting out the menu items!   Oh man - how it will date us when we are telling these stories to our kids! :)

So... dim sum withOUT the lovely ladies is: 
1)  less entertaining  
2)  and there is no more pointing and ordering... \"oh! I want that one! \"... so you must know your menu items or just blindly order!

 haha but the good thing about ordering on a sheet is that it is \"steamed\" to order and comes out hot (and most places now use this method of ordering).  

Food was ok, some good, some bad. The bad was the rice paper rolls - it was ridiculous how thick the rice paper was ! hahah.  


RANT....  and now my ranting.  I used to be able to eat dim sum - back in the days when the only shrimp you'd find would be in a shrimp dumpling, or shrimp toast.  Then I became allergic to shrimp,  and now shrimp is added to almost every dim sum item!!! WTF?!?!?!    Pork dumplings should be pork dumplings! Not pork dumplings with shrimp on top  (note: shrimp is not even listed on order sheet), and the pork and chives dumpling had shrimp IN it too (again no shrimp listed on the order sheet)!!   =O  Oh Em Gee!    Why not just make 2 dumplings and charge more for the ones with shrimp on top?!?! hahah  wouldn't that make more sense?!  ...  But really, it's a Chinese restaurant and no one will read this and it will never change... unless... UNLESS!!!  someone has an anaphylactic reaction because they eat a pork dumpling but instead is surprised with pork and shrimp!!  

....I call \"NOT IT\"!! :)  It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye (or goes to the ER)!!  ;-P"}
{"text":"This is not an update but more of a review of the hot pot buffet fare at Chinese Cultural Centre Restaurant.  Hot Pot is on only in the evenings which starts at 5 p.m.  From Fri to Sun, the buffet price is $22.95 per person and from Mon to Thu, the price is $20.95 per person.  We went for the Sat night hot pot dinner and found the restaurant at about 65% full.  

We picked our 2 soup bases of chicken broth with ginseng and another with different chinese herbs and broth.  Off we went to the buffet and selected our food items to cook at the hot pot at our table.  There was all kinds of seafood like prawns with the shell on, shrimps without the shell, fish paste, squid paste, meat paste, oysters, squid, calamari, fish balls, squid balls, meat balls, pork blood cubes, beef, lamb, pork, enoki mushrooms, tofu, deep-fried tofu, and greens of all kinds.  Then, there's the table with all kinds of sauces to go with your cooked food items.  There's a 2 hour limit on eating hot pot.  There are 4 kinds of hot desserts, jellos, and some mini cookies.

All in all, the wait service was good - they kept coming to take our dirty dishes away and filled up our hot pot with more water to keep the soup going.  

We also ordered a 1.5 litre bottle of plum juice to cool our mouths as we ate our hot cooked food items.  

Lots of Asians that evening which is a good sign for a Chinese restaurant.  

Hot pot food on a cold evening sure was good!"}
{"text":"Thought I should point out that you cannot get Hot Pot here during the summer.

So our Hot Pot UYE was a little derailed, but luckily they still serve food so we were not forced to eat the serving utensils.

With our group of 8 we all ordered one dish to share, we were given all the english menus in the restaurant, meaning they have 5 total. Luckily we didn't have to point to order and ended up with plenty to dine on.
Highlights were the war won ton soup, which I have never had before and I do not know why because shrimp in your won ton is amazing! Take plain boring won ton soup and then make it super!
The ginger beef was very nice, the breading wasn't overpowering and the beef was also not cooked within an inch of its life.
We also had a really nice fried rice, some crispy noodles, mushrooms and pea tips, other ginger beef that has been cooked with ginger, and chicken in black bean sauce. I wouldn't hesitate to order any of those dishes again.

I had an accident with my chair and the chair rail, smashing my finger then almost bleeding over the dessert buffet. Oh yeah free dessert buffet! There was stuff in slow cookers that I had no idea what any of it was. Being too white, I stuck to the cookies, and the red bean and mango jelly cups.

The best part of our dining experience was, I didn't feel like crap later that evening.

With the 8 of us, it came to 20 bucks a person, we had tea as well as 5 beers.
Not too shabby!"}
