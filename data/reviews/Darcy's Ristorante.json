{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Arizona!!!! I highly recommend the everything on the menu. Gianfranco is an amazing chef with endless experience and very dedicated to his craft. The atmosphere, music, staff, and beverage selection will not disappoint you! Amazing food and amazing service!"}
{"text":"So am a transplant from the Philly area - this was ok'ish food.  Nothing to write home about with excellent service bumping it up from 2 to 3 stars.    Bluntly, this place is overpriced from a-z.  $6 for a bottle of Stella, $16 for melon/proscuitto, to Chicken Parmigiana at $26.50.    Great atmosphere - but not great food.  PS the creme brulee was not fully set"}
{"text":"I went here on the day before Valentine's day with my boyfriend and the cutest old couple bought our dinner(: great service! And so delicious"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for very average food. Ambiance is nice and staff was very good. Plastic flowers and fake candles match the food. Was crowded on a Saturday night. The only reason I could guess that the local upscale locals do no not want to bother to drive too far to get a good meal."}
{"text":"While good is more than acceptable everyone we know complains about the price. The wine list is like quadruple retail. And when we asked why we were given the brush off like this was beneath them to respond. Well folks Madoson Ave it ain't. It's in a strip mall next to a workout studio. Get real guys. Fix the prices."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food.  Great service.   Tasty gluten free options.  So glad we tried this restaurant on our visit to Scottsdale.    Due to my gluten intolerance I rarely get to enjoy Italian restaurants.   This was such a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant, I can't believe there are not more reviews. The service was great, and the food was amazing. I usually never order chicken dishes at a restaurant fearing that the chicken with be dry. However I was proven wrong! Their Petto di Pollo alla Martini - Chicken Martini was mouthwatering and perfectly cooked. My dining companion had their seafood special and raved about it as well. They had a fantastic wine list with selections of Italian wine as well. Our server was kind enough to give us some small pours to help us decide on what to get. I would return to this restaurant in a heartbeat! keep it up Gianfranco!"}
{"text":"While the food was excellent, the extraordinarily slow service put a negative damper on the whole evening.  It's unfortunate because the restaurant is very convenient for us."}
{"text":"Again a amazing dinner. We had some appetizers and amazing risotto primavera with chicken. Can't go wrong with this hidden gem. Great service and food as always !!"}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive service. Along with the printed menu, there were five or so appetizers and the same amount of entrees explained to us by our waiter. Fresh, well prepared food.   Pricey, but I don't mind it when you get the type of food and service we enjoyed tonight. If you dine here, ask about the story behind Franco. Very interesting. Definitely adding Gianfranco's to the list."}
{"text":"THE BEST!!  Amazing Italian food.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is for the price (and the creepy \"chef\" that came around, he was prettty weird..  I ordered the Linguine Carbonara and it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted.  Hubby got the Veal Valdostana and he HIGHLY recommended it.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Wow... That's all I can say.. And I mean wow as in how could someone possibly eat this food? We walked in and were greeted by a grumpy woman. We got no Hi or Hello. As soon as we walked into the main restaurant, it was all monotone. It was all brown and beiges and extremely old. There were about eight others in the restaurant, so that was definitely as bad sign. A customer was walking back to her table and across the restaurant yelled \" Oh my gosh I just ripped a huge one in the bathroom\". We were disgusted. We were immediately served bread and given menus. Bread was okay.. wasn't warm and we were given hard butter. The butter would have been nice to add to the bland bread we were given. We receive our food and the presentation was not impressive, as the waiter had previously stated. Two of my family members ordered the veal and chicken piccata and both sauces looked completely different. The chicken was tough and tasted horrible. Someone else ordered the special, veal and cheese stuffed ravioli in a red vodka sauce. The sauce was hot, but once the ravioli was cut, I knew it was out of a package. The middle was completely cold and the pasta was chewy. It was so obvious everything was NOT homemade. Someone else ordered the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. It was very gloppy and looked like it came out of a package as well. The chicken tasted like it was freeze dried and made for NASA. The meal was completely awful and the prices are sure as hell overpriced. I would never tell anyone to eat at this place. The chef should try his/her food because it is horrible. I was tempted to enter this restaurant to be on Restaurant Impossible so Robert Irvine can redo the decor to lighten it up and to fix the food so it is edible. If the restaurant used real chicken, those chickens would be running out the door because the food is that bad. I thought I had gone to an Italian restaurant, but there was no Italian food that I tasted. All we got was the expensive bill for microwaved food and chronic diarrhea. This deserves two thumbs down and a pink slip."}
{"text":"It was a disappointing evening.  We went with friends and were so excited to have dinner here.  The food was inconsistent - the lobster bisque was salty, lacking a robust body.  However, the penne with shrimp in vodka sauce was very good.  The customer service was disappointing - needed to ask three times for a diet coke and three times to get some more bread.  We saw our waiter twice - he took our order and delivered the bill -- in-between he was no where to be seen.  The food was overpriced.  The restaurant noise level made it very difficult to hold a conversation with our dinner partners."}
{"text":"I've only been to see Franco couple of times since he opened in Troon North... vs when he was at Un Bacio, I was there more frequently. I must say that he's food has always been consistent regardless of the location. It's just good Italian food that I'm familiar with.The service staff was always courteous and accommodating. atmosphere comfortable.  If I didn't live so far away, I see myself there more often, especially when my wallet can afford it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The food is excellent and the staff is always welcoming and professional. I love the pork chop, sea bass, scampi, soups, crab salad, beet salad.. I could go on and on. It is truly amazing. I look forward to dining at Gianfrancos. The owner is very personable and a great host and fabulous chef."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I agree with other reviewers. We've tried the place twice now. The first experience was bad and this second time, we were invited by my husbands boss, so we were obligated to go, and it was bad again.   Overpriced for average food. $44 for shrimp scampi??!! He is out of his mind. $42.50 for a 4x4 square of lasagna, with no sides. Want Green Beans? That will be $8. I'd rather have Olive Garden for $10  The owner runs around yelling profanities and racial slurs and treating his employees like dirt. The turnaround with the staff is constant. Just another scumbag restaurant owner who gets drunk and takes it out on the staff.   Poor operation with poor food. We will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"former employe very unsainatairty franco the owner would smoke cigs and drink on the line while making food, he would hire escorts there is usally one there named courtney ive seen ice cream scopps fall on the floor and just get re used, he re uses peoples half eaten foods very disgusting man is a cheapstalke"}
{"text":"4-1/2 stars for food . . . 2 stars for service.   I had no idea this place even existed . . . it is tucked away in a shopping center behind Pinnacle Peak in the Troon North area. I am so glad our friends recommended that we have dinner there. First of all, the dining room is really pretty. It reminded me of an old style Italian restaurant from back East in so many ways . . . and you would never know it from the outside.   The offered a summer special menu of $34.95 for a starter (appetizer, salad or soup), entree, dessert, and coffee -- a true bargain if you were to add everything up separately.   For starters, we all ordered something different . . . calamari fritti, mixed green salad with Gorgonzola, Prosciutto di Parma over fresh seasonal melon, and the beef carpaccio. All were a hit except my salad was pretty unremarkable and ordinary.   Entrees were AMAZING! All entrees (except pasta) come with a choice of side, either pasta or the daily veggie (green beans that night). Hubby had the Veal Martini (Veal cutlet breaded with parmesan cheese, saut√©ed in brown sauce and topped with asparagus). I had the Veal Parmigiana, as did one of our friends. The veal was so incredibly tender you could cut it with only your fork -- heavenly. For me, the veal parm hearkened back to the old days in the late 1960s and early 1970s when I was a kid in Pittsburgh, PA. We had a favorite restaurant that my family went to every Sunday called the Park Schenley. Perhaps I have romanticized my experience of it, but I always compare any veal parm to the one there, and Gianfranco didn't disappoint! BRAVO!! My other friend (another Yelper) had the Scampi Classico (I hope she will write a review too). The shrimp were huge and looked really succulent, but we were so busy chatting away, I didn't get a chance to ask her how it tasted. I am assuming because she finished it with no complaints that she was very pleased.   For dessert, hubby had the Tiramisu. It was a very hefty portion and he made no excuse for orgasmically moaning how delicious it was. I had the cannoli . . . it was just okay. The filling was a little too creamy for my taste. I like my cannoli heavy on the ricotta texture. Coffee was delicioso! I forgot to ask what kind they serve.   Service was a downer, to say the least. S-L-O-W. Our server apologized for the slow service and blamed it on the fact that the restaurant was closing for two weeks for summer vacation and everyone decided to come in that night . . . they weren't prepared for such a crowd. I have to wonder how that could be when we were one of the first tables seated and we were the last to leave, why that was . . . Believe me, we were not lingering . . . It seems that this is not unusual based on other reviewers comments.   Even still, the food (and the company) more than made up for the lack of service. We will definitely be regulars here, but we will make sure that if we are pressed for time (which fortunately we were not this particular night), we will let them know in advance."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of our favorite places for both Happy Hour and more formal dining.  When guests are in from out of town, it's a must!  The new Owner Darcy is wonderful and really cares that his customers receive the best food and service.  Lots of favorites on the menu but, when he has lasagna on the menu as a special, there is no hesitation!  Mike, Gary & Oscar (bartenders) are excellent and attentive.  During the weekends in season, there is music in the lounge.  Wonderful outside dining and full bar as well. In season).    I am a Concierge for a local upscale resort and I/we recommend our guests to Darcy's daily AND we eat there ourselves!"}
{"text":"Tucked inside a small but nice north Scottsdale plaza I never knew was there. Happy now that I have been introduced to this charming Italian delight! The mood is casual, comfortable ,and great for older families or a business dinner. A romantic first date can also be accomplished nicely. Our server was patient as we chatted and never did we feel rushed. After deciding on wine our glasses were never empty. I like that! Great wine list too! Appetizers of Calamari and Carpaccio came and went! Loved the Carpaccio, the Calamari was just ok. Veal Marsala was my choice and just as I anticipated it was excellent. My friend had a fresh catch, I think halibut and it was very good as well. i love that Chef came over to say hello on such a busy night. That is a nice touch and makes you feel special and at home. It was a wonderful dining experience and i look forward to coming back to sit outside for dessert and cappuccino!"}
{"text":"We have had dinner here in the past and it was very good however the service was the worst I have had in years.  The waiter took drink orders and it took over 20 minutes to get drinks.  We finally were given the opportunity to place our order after 50 minutes and waited for an hour for food to be delivered.  One of the five people in our group did not even receive her dinner.  I must say that this will be coming off of our recommendation list as a place to take visitors for dinner.  There are to many places with good service and food to choose from.  The restaurant did comp our dinner but we would have much rather had a nice evening.  When we asked for the manager they brought an extremely young waiter from another area to address our problem and he stated that he was a close to management as we would get."}
{"text":"When they get rid of Mike the bartender I might return.  He should have left with Gianfranco, he is horrible and not a good representation of what the new owner is trying to do."}
{"text":"Very good meal and outstanding service.  Big variety of wine from Italy and US.  Outstanding Caesar salad with anchovies.  Linguini with a red clam sauce with a generous helping of clams.  Loved the cannoli, with berries."}
{"text":"We live close by and decided we needed to finally try this place for drinks and appetizers in the bar. Net-net is good service and drinks, but lousy (and overpriced) food. We had three different items, and there wasn't one we'd have again -- calamari, for example, was definitely the frozen breaded variety and the marinara seemed out of a can. The menu is also very old school...e.g., prosciutto wrapped melon! The servers, though, are very friendly and the owner definitely goes out of his way to entertain the guests!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, mediocre food at best. My advice save your money."}
{"text":"Disappointing - high energy equals lousy ambiance for a quiet romantic dinner. Odd tables (table for two much longer than usual - 4 ft from your table mate). Food was fair - very expensive and therefore marginal value. Tried it once, will not be back"}
{"text":"Best italian in phoenix! We drive 45min one way for this place."}
{"text":"Over rated... After reading the reviews we were expecting a great night of Italian food, this was not the case.  We were seated at one of the two tops and with how the tables are setup it's not possible for the person sitting next to the wall the sit down without moving the table.  We are both thin and watched other diners sit down and feel cramped all night.  I had the Lobster Bisque soup special it was good and had lots of large pieces of lobster in the soup but the flavor profile was different from any lobster bisque I have had in my life and it came out scolding hot.  At first glance the dinner menu looks big but when you realize 80% of the entrees are breaded veal or chicken with different sauces on them the menu becomes small.  Our dinner entrees probably spent a little too much time sitting in the window in the kitchen the plates were scolding hot and my veal looked like it had been sitting there a while.  My wife's chicken Marsala was good but my veal was just average.  For the price I expected more..."}
{"text":"Gianfranco's food is simply delicious.  I had a fish special (can't remember details at the moment) and it was very good.  But my husband ordered a simple alfredo dish.  He says the true test of good italian is to order something simple, and if they do that right, they likely do the rest very well.  That alfredo sauce was the BEST alfredo sauce I've ever tasted.  YUM.  It's close by to our house, so we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner there tonight, and I have to say I was exceedingly underwhelmed. This was our first time going, and I can honestly say I won't be back. Our server was very nice, but not as attentive as he should have been. Our water and wine glasses sat empty far too long for this type of place. My chief complaint lies in the food itself. The bread served was so hard I nearly broke a tooth. (And we had numerous pieces brought to our table.) Also, the chicken Marsala was absolutely tasteless. I had to keep adding salt and pepper to make it somewhat friendly to my palate. I'm not trying to be funny when I tell you I've had much better Chicken Marsala from the frozen food section at Safeway. Much.  For the prices they charge, the food should be out of this world delicious. It's not.  This is not a place I would ever recommend to anyone. Especially at these over inflated prices."}
{"text":"This is, simply put, classic Italian food at it's best.  I am partial to the Chicken Valdostana, but just about on the menu is excellent.  The specials are usually pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Food is great.   Update your hours on yelp, might want add hours to your automated messages since you can't get ahold of anyone."}
{"text":"We were able to get a reservation on short notice via Open Table when everything else nearby was booked.  Was this good or bad?  The food rating was high so we went for it.  From a food perspective, it was quite good. My Caesar salad was very good and the lasagna special was too.  My wife had a pasta dish that was excellent if you like garlic!  The service was a bit suspect at first - we sat there for ten minutes without anyone approaching us. But once they caught on it was good from that point on.  My biggest complaint was the outdated decor, chairs and AC system that kept blowing a breeze through the place all night.  Keep your expectations low and you'll be happy more than likely."}
{"text":"Brilliant food! Simply magnificent. I had a friend recommend this restaurant at the older location in Scottsdale. I've seen it in Troon near Pinnacle Peak but never really was interested until my wife and I had a craving for Italian and didn't want a long journey from home so we though Why Not... Lets splurge...  I had the minestrone soup as an appetizer. Mouthwatering to say the least and very healthy (not too salty like other soups) Dipping in the fresh baked bread with butter and I was full enough to walk away content.  My wife had the crab appetizer with a mix of fresh stuff that is beyond my expertise of understanding so I'll leave it at that. I did take a taste and it was magnificent. Light, not too rich and sooooooo mouthwatering!  For the main course she had the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and she commented that it was the best she had ever had. She ate only about 1/3 of the plate and took the rest home. the food is VERY RICH so you could split a main course and be content.  I had a pasta dish with meat filled tortellini and prosciutto in a rich cream sauce. To die for...Really....Heaven here I come.  So, this is a well run restaurant with a brilliant chef and some very special and individual dishes.  The ONLY negative Is the service. It took wayyyyyy too long in between meals and at times we felt completely ignored by the wait staff who wold rush over to the table apologizing taking so long and then it's as if they ignored what they just said as we would wait again for someone else to arrive.  The best approach to eating here is not to be rushed, order the drinks AND the appetizers at the same time and then after your close to finishing the appetizers get another drink ordered. Your main course will be late, but by the time it gets there you should be feeling tolerant enough to enjoy what you can ingest and then take the rest home OR split the main course and you should be good.  Desert was ok, nothing remarkable..."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Service was terrible. Waited 30 minutes to get our salads. Then dinner came out 5 minutes later, except for one of our dinners that we had to wait another 10 minutes for. Obviously, the kitchen messed up. No apology, nothing. Food was ok, but all the fish dishes tasted and were prepared exactly the same, despite different fish being ordered. On the bill, they overcharged us for the wine compared to the price on the menu. When I pointed it out to the waiter, he acted surprised that I caught it and then said he would adjust the bill \"for us\". Really! Intentionally overcharge your customers and then no apology, but rather a sarcastic remark. They are arrogant, and for no reason at all. WE WONT BE RETURNING!!!  Buyer beware! Check your bill very carefully! The place was near empty, geeee, I wonder why!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, Fabulous service. One of our favorite spots. Being your wallet it's pricey but worth it if your looking for a fine dining experience xo..."}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing! We came here for my husband's birthday and they treated us like royalty! I love when you can sit down and enjoy a dinner without feeling like your server is trying to \"turn the table\". Our server was in no rush at all, but not in a bad way. We were seated promptly and pour glasses of ice water. Our table was unbelievably freezing. Since most restaurants in the summer are cold I had brought a pashmina, but it was just not enough. The server immediately noticed my discomfort and adjusted the thermostat. That is really attentive! We had an appetizer of calamari which was good, but pretty standard. For our salads my husband had the one with blue cheese which was good and I the caprese which was really awesome! Then came the highlight..... for our meals my husband had the veal parmigiana which he loved until he tasted my Veal Piemontese that was an explosion!!! I would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on May 5, same entrees - we both had serious stomach/digestive problems that night - I'll skip the details. I called the next day and talked to a young receptionist - the mgrs., Karen and Tom, were not yet in. I explained my problem to the receptionist - she had no clue re the menu items. I asked her to have one of the mgrs. call me. Noe one has yet called. My recommendation - skip this place."}
{"text":"First time at this Restuarant . Set back off the road. Food was very good, Service  was fine. Price was in line with the quality of both. Will definitely be heading back. Might move it up one more star after I see the quality of both holds up over time."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked pasta. Very clean comfortable place. Excellent service. Not cheap but such good food. I had the carbonara which was the best I have had in Arizona so far. My mother had a pork chop smothered in brown gravy that was to die for. I hope they have this the next time I go because I will order this for sure. Best Italian in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"You step in and walk into an upscale grandma's dining room. You might hear as we did a deep Italian Voice singing from the kitchen who might have been the chef. Our waiter also had an Italian accent and was very enthusiastic explaining the evenings dinner specials. We went with one of the appetizer specials and two of the dinner specials since they seemed very good.  Someone soon brings us very crusty bread, they provide butter but also have very high quality olive oil on the table to use.  My husband started the house made pasta that had pieces of veal osso bucco threw it in a well made sauce. He just kept saying this is really good.  I started with a light arugula salad. The salad was small but not too small , the salad was dressed nicely and was fresh.  I went with the Branzino since it was flown in yesterday. The fish was so fresh you almost tasted the seawater in it. My meal was cooked to perfection and the lemon white wine caper sauce just danced in my mouth and showed the skill of a trained chef. I picked the green beans as my side and they were cooked threw but crisp, lightly buttered and came out the most beautiful emerald green color.  My husband had the pork chop, the waiter didn't ask how he'd like it prepared but it came out perfect. The pork chop was lightly breaded and topped with prosciutto and fontina cheese. The sauce that the chop was in was in was also out of this world , very flavorful and made the dish special.  Like magic both dinners stayed piping hot till the last bite.  I didn't have any problems using my preferred Diner's Card getting me one meal for free. The gratuity gets added on when you use a card.  Maybe the menu and decor is a little Old Fashioned but the place is very neat and clean.   4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how I felt about this restaurant but I am going to try! First off the hostess was not friendly at all and I would almost say RUDE.  I ordered the Italian soup with spinach and egg and it looked like I threw up my egg and spinach omelet from breakfast.  Of the four entrees we ordered nothing was good and very small portions!  The prices were so high and the portions were very small........a BIG tourist trap for sure!!!! I am warning everyone, do not go to this restaurant unless you want to be bent over! Gianfrancos should be ashamed to call themselves a restaurant. Definitely two thumbs down!i would rather have gone to Olive Garden and save my money!!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in my mouth. Gianfranco came to our table to see how it was, very cool. Will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Finally finally finally. As close to East Coast  Italian we have been able to find!  So excited for our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not what it used to be, food not as good, no homemade pasta, waiters leaving, busboy drips order. Pathetic, don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"They need some reasonably priced wines. $16 for a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is too high. Competitors offer for almost half. Also need some bottles in the high $30 range or at least mid $40 range. Again most of their competitors have a few wines in these ranges.   Friendly service, great atmosphere and good food"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and our waiter Scott was lovely. No complaints about him as he was attentive and knowledgeable. We were mostly disappointed with the food. Two of us ordered beet salads- a special- which amounted to a bowl of sliced beets and red onion in a light dressing. It wasn't bad, just underwhelming. The calamari app was delicious- some of the best we've had. During our starters, one in our party had to ask three times for a piece of bread. He also asked for a Caesar salad, dressed with just olive oil. Unfortunately it arrived doused with regular Caesar dressing. I'm sure it was tasty, but not what he requested. My fettuccine bolognese was delicious- a great portion and minimal garlic (per my request). My boyfriend's pork- again another special- was disappointing. Cool and just meh. If we could do three and a half stars we would as Scott was lovely and we enjoyed being waited on by him."}
{"text":"Over priced, average service. Nothing special with the food. Bland and typical micro waved food. Bread not fresh and wine menu over priced with cheap italian wines. Get costco carry out instead."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on at this restaurant but they are certainly having some issues with service. Dined last night and we ordered Caesar salads which came out in record time. Good salad but the issue is they were meant for the couple at the adjoining table! The mix up was not discovered until we had already started to eat the salad so the poor couple now has to wait quite some time for \"their\" salads to arrive. Took forever for my second drink order to arrive. Waiter had to be reminded. My wife ordered a pasta entree with added chicken. It came without the chicken and so I had to wait with my food getting cold while hers was replaced. The waiter did comp us to a dessert to make up for the issues. All that being said the food was excellent so that is what is getting them three stars. They need to work on the food delivery piece before I would recommend."}
{"text":"This our first time here. What a great restaurant. Food is great. Very good server. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes good Italian food. We had the Riesling wine, which was very good. Veal piccata was excellent, my husband had the pork chop special that was wonderful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, staff and dining atmosphere!  Mike the bartender is really a character!!  Enjoyed immensely and very reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite is hanging in the bar and watching football while having great wine and down to earth conversations with the seasonal locals.  If you want a more formal experience though, the dining area is cozy, the service very professional and the food superb.  Don't miss the bone-in chop with proscutto and fontina cheese with gravy! Slurp!"}
{"text":"Recently, we went to Darcy's for dinner with another couple. We had been before, and enjoyed the food. We STILL enjoyed the food...but we had the worst service we have ever had, anywhere, ever that night. It took quite a while before we even had water and/or bread. When our actual waiter FINALLY appeared, we thought we had better order right then, before he was lost to us again. Fortunately, we ordered our wine at the same time, because he never appeared again! He, nor anyone else, ever came around to see if we were pleased with our meals, if we wanted or needed more wine or anything else, or if dessert was an option. Seriously? By the way, although the restaurant was crowded when we arrived, there were only 2 tables there when we were ready to leave. Someone was actually blowing out candles everywhere, when I came out of the Ladies. But still - no bill. We sat, and sat, and sat...and could not get our waiter's attention. He was busy chatting with the one other table in the restaurant. He never even looked our way! We will NEVER return to this restaurant again, even though the food was very good! We can get Italian food at other restaurants. I prefer to enjoy good food AND good service at the same time, don't you?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Casual crowd but stylish room and professional service. Interesting and intriguing combination.  Happy hour is half price wine and appetizers but they start at more than double so it's not a deal. $20 each becomes $10, where it should start. And the food was bad. Tiny, too salty clams. Unripe melon on a platter of prosciutto is not melon wrapped in prosciutto.  Dinner menu is reputed to be better value and quality so we will go again but don't try happy hour. It's expensive and lousy food."}
{"text":"Greeted in the parking lot by Gianfranco! I kid you not. Never been to the place before but made to feel as if I was family. Ordered the Branzino (one of several unreal daily specials) and it was probably the best Branzino I have had off the Adriatic. Tried several of the other dishes that were just as good. Service is some of the best I have experienced. Very knowledgeable and not pushy. Waiter suggested excellent Italian wine from Montepulciano that was actually very reasonably priced. Will return and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"By far the best classic Italian Restaurant in  Scottsdale. The chef came to our table and I asked him to prepare what he thought was best for us , did not disappoint. Big personality , great food, fun environment."}
{"text":"Always an amazing experience here. With out a doubt the finest Italian restaurant in Arizona.  I've traveled extensively and cannot remember a better dining experience.  Ask for James the server. He's awesome."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a romantic place to take your date, that has class and style, then this is the place for you.  It isn't cheap, but it sure is good.   I had a fish dish with a martini that was out of this world. Tender, tasty, moist, and what every other words that can describe AWESOME meal.   The ambiance is subdued, with low lighting, elegant dining room designed for low sound travel, so although you're in a restaurant, it seems quiet. So your conversation can go on and on without having to say \"excuse me\" as you try to talk over the crowd.   I wish Gianfanco could get the patio thing going so one could enjoy his food with the views of the area. Perhaps someday.   My date had a ravioli type dish and said it was amazing as well. Just the right size portion too.   Gianfanco, you're amazing!"}
{"text":"Last Christmas Eve the Owner greeted all patrons except minorities.  This was done pointedly and made everyone very uncomfortable.  I was very surprised by his behavior and since that time never dined there again."}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday night for the third time. Place was nearly empty. Food is good, not great - basic Italian. Great summer deal (4 courses $40). Wait staff exceptional. I had the crab salad OK, chick parmiagano OK and creme br√ªl√©e...all OK.  Franco was in the dining hall and it completely spoiled the ambiance. He is loud and spent about 20 minutes talking to a couple who were loudly bashing a local prominent businessman whose business is in trouble.  A decent, basic Italian restaurant - I hope Franco stays in the kitchen when you visit. If not, bring ear plugs!"}
{"text":"There were the four of us. We all enjoyed our meals but understaffed - we had retrieve and pour our own wine. We did not see our waiter from the time we ordered until the meal was done. When the lack of attention was pointed out, there was little validation of our concerns - only lip service."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with friends.  Wanted to like it as we like Italian restaurants in our neighborhood.  Good to see that the restaurant was quite busy in the high season.  Was very disappointed in the $52 (cheapest) Italian red wine on the menu.  Would have guessed that it was $10 or less retail, but it seems that it was about $19.  Food was OK but nothing special.  James was a pleasant waiter but didn't like that I asked the prices of the many \"specials\" that he announced.  The restaurants that I like don't need to embarrass me to have to ask the price.  In the neighborhood, Local Bistro and Spiga are a lot better for atmosphere, service and value for money."}
{"text":"My previous review was when Gianfranco was  there.  The food was good but the owner was a foul mouthed person that totally detracted from the  dining experience. We went tonight, new owner,  the food was not the same and not in a good way. My chicken dish was over breaded and over cooked.  My wife's pomadoro pasta was cloying with a very heavy touch and not good. Go to Pane E Vino for the best version of this dish. $4 extra for a maybe an ounce of meat sauce on my side? If you go on weekends there is \"entertainment\" Tonight was maybe hippy wanna be who screamed into the mic w/the amps on high. Not a fun or good dining night.  Oh Well."}
{"text":"My husband and I are diners and thankfully have blessed to eat at several Top 10 restaurants around the world (Publications: Zagat, Elite Travel, Food & Wine etc...).  We love Italian food and when we first dined at Gianfranco's we felt like we were back in Italy.  We are North Scottsdale residents and have dined at several other fine dining restaurants and NOTHING even compares to the food or service.  We have dined at Gianfranco's numerous times.  The consistency of food quality is unmatched, even by the finest restaurants in NYC, Chicago and Los Angeles.      From the moment you walk through the door you are greeted and seated promptly in a beautiful restaurant with ambiance.  John, our favorite server, is very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and is a true professional.  The entire staff from behind the bar to their assistance are remarkable.       Not to be missed and one of my favorites is the house made Veal ravioli's in a pink vodka sauce.  Wow, incredible!     This is a culinary experience not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Chef Gianfranco Motti was once at the helm at un bacio ristorante, before venturing on his own near Troon North to give Sassi a little competition.  Not afraid to acknowledge that Gianfranco's cuisine is somewhat more accessible , palate and wallet friendy than neighboring Sassi. Their dining room is warm, somewhat too dark yet inviting. Service is warm, not obtrusive. Dishes like the classic tomato and mozzarella salads are not exactly creative but always good. The veal piccata was very flavorful ; however the presentation had no wow factor.  The most inviting factor in Gianfranco's is the simplicity of its food. Couple that with a cozy and romantic atmosphere, warm and knowledgeable staff, and you really cannot go wrong. On top of that, the charm of nearby Pinnacle Peak adds to a soothing, delightful, and memorable evening.  Gianfranco does not cater to the adventurous diner. It is a classic Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant since before they renovated it.  It looks beautiful and very upscale! I was excited to take my boyfriend and his cousin that was visiting from the midwest.  He wanted Italian.  Oscar the bartender that has worked there ( and another local favorite for years) was not there on March 1st when we dined.  We made a reservation and were sat in the rear of the restaurant by the window.  We had a clear view of the entire dining room and unfortunately his cousin had a view of just us.  It was a little busy but not filled.  Our server Brian greeted us and seemed very energetic and upbeat.  Taking our beverage order and explaining the specials he returned to take our order.  As a pescatarian and not feeling well, I just opted for soup and salad.  I asked if they had eggplant as I seemed to recall having it the last time I was there.  He said no, but if we came back he'd give me a card and we could call and request it in advance.  I appreciated that offer.  Pretty much after that we saw every other server/bus person than Brian.  We had finished our first beverages and  no one came around.  I could see Brian crouching beside his other tables chatting away and at one point sitting on a chair joining one of his tables.  As frequent diners all over town I can understand that when you're a regular.  However as we hadn't visited this location ( 3 miles from our new home ) together before, I would think we would have had a slightly more attentive welcome to the neighborhood service.    Finally after I watched him butterfly all over the room, without even looking back at us, I took my empty wine glass to the bar to order another glass of wine and a beer for my boyfriend.  Our guest ( his cousin ) also commented on the lack of service and he never complains.  On my way to the bar Brian was there at the computer, and I said \"don't worry, we'll get our own\".  Now, I am in the service industry myself.  I use a lot of humor with the general public as it's a must.  I don't think Brian took too kindly to it, as he said no no, I'll send your order through the computer, and after that he NEVER returned to the table.  A replacement server, Mitch came over several times before we asked what happened to Brian?  He said it was probably better that he didn't return.  I have no idea what that meant, but I said, oh he's being a chicken?  He shouldn't be afraid....! Apparently he has no problem buddying up to his 'regulars' but had no interest in taking care of us?  It was probably the WORST service we've had in that caliber or any restaurant in an extremely long time.  The food was pretty good, but the service was beyond  disappointing.  No manager ever approached to double check.  No one was at the door when we left.  Our cousin paid the check, so I don't know what the total was or if they discounted anything.  I could care less if they did or not, however we will  just sit at the bar as we normally do, when I confirm Oscar is working.  If we have out of town guests, we will take them where we know we can get great service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I would say the BEST in Arizona for Italian. The staff  explains the specials well. The staff is always very busy. The price for just entrees is quite expensive.  The atmosphere is elegant. I have been a fan of this place since it opened!"}
{"text":"I would actually give this 3.5. Good meal, but very overpriced. I had some chicken with asparagus and cheese that was very good, but close to $30 in price. The Tiramisu was all cream....not very much liqueur or cake. Coffee was good. Meh overall."}
{"text":"I hate to write a less-than-favorable review of a neighborhood restaurant but this one bears mentioning.  We dined here Saturday evening and everything was going along just swimmingly (food was good, service thus far was good) and then it was time to end our experience.  It may never have bothered me that our waiter in this relatively high-end eatery was wearing \"dude pants\", i.e., the kind you see on a skateboarder, waistline mid-butt and sagging crotch.  BUT, eventually it did.  We waited so long for the check our dining companion left.  (We told him to as we could see his patience was fading) It took 10 minutes to receive our check.  It then took another 7 minutes for the waiter to pick it up.  And that's the last time he visited our table.  I kid you not, we waited another 10 minutes (I know, why did we wait that long?) and by then we were steaming and I had to go in search of him.  I found him milling about doing nothing.  I gave him the \"What's happening?\" arm sign and he mocked me by returning the same sign.  Then he reached in his apron pocket and handed me my credit card and bill as if he forgot he never brought it back to me (which is likely the case).  I don't mind paying $32 for a bowl of pasta when it is very well done with impeccable service and ambience but this was so insulting we are not returning.  There are plenty of fabulous restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Starting with the food this place is wonderful! For me the Mozzarella Caprese and the Linguine Carbonara actually made up for all of the weirdness we encountered on our visit.  You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind; at least that is what our visit felt like... Our waiter was obviously (or hopefully) new - we asked for a bottle of sparkling water for the table and one of us wanted a glass of still; the response was, \"We only have large bottles of still water,\" as other people were being served out of the familiar restaurant pitchers of water. One of us wanted one of the starters on the menu and a salad; I guess not being familiar with the menu they were asked several times if they wanted two salads. Then, when the requested starter did come the whole table got plates to share what one person wanted. Assuming this person is new, where is the shadow to train them?  If that was not enough on a rather empty night (maybe four other tables occupied) we were witness to one loud table across the room that was fighting with each other and another, more nearby, that I guess just got a new iPhone and was hoping to find a thesaurus app to spice up their emails.  So, back to the food which is really what it is all about... The food is excellent and well worth a visit. Hopefully the comedy show caliber of oddities that surrounded us was the result of some cosmic synchronicity and not a regular event!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, food was mediocre. Porkchop was dry like it had been sitting out. Server barely checked on our table."}
{"text":"Food and service is good , however, beware of the owner, Gianfranco. he has a potential to go postal on unsuspecting patrons for no apparent reason. Screaming, cursing, etc. Dine at your own risk"}
