{"text":"An unexpected find in a Nissan dealership: hot, fresh coffee! Bonus points for offering tasty seasonal specials and alternative milks (soy). Prices are good, service is friendly, and they offer a half-off Yelp check-in discount- didn't check in til after I ordered it, so I'll have to come back to use it. They brew Seattle's Best and offer teas and a variety of baked breakfast options such as bagels and muffins. I wish more car service centers offered these kinds of amenities."}
{"text":"Thanks for the free coffee as I wait and get service on my car. You're awesome.  It is a nice bonus to have a coffee shop within an automotive dealership so you can sit down relax have a cup of coffee and enjoy the news."}
{"text":"When I checked in at United Nissan, up popped the check in offer for a free small coffee here. 

After coming into the waiting area, I went to the bar and showed them my Yelp offer. I was the first one who had ever done so. 

I was going to get a regular coffee but the two women working here urged me to splurge and I ended up getting a white chocolate frappe.  

It's very tasty and the service was with a big smile. 

It pays to Yelp and check in!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes my Passion Tea so good I would consider coming here even if I wasn't at United Nissan!

The girls who work here are always so pleasant and friendly! They make some amazing drinks and are super quick!

I get a Passion Tea Iced with Mango sweetened. This drink will get you through your hardest days I promise you!

If you are getting a service done at United Nissan or shopping for a new car make sure you stop by and pay these ladies a visit as well!"}
