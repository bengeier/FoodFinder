{"text":"The fried zucchini are worth coming down here for. The sourdough melt was ok, it needed avocado and no iceberg lettuce (use any other kind of lettuce). Next time I'll try egg and bacon burger. As for zucchini, this is the only place I've seen in Phoenix that actually gives zucchini sticks cut thickly (instead of puny medallions that are all breading)"}
{"text":"Their Blue Cheese Wedge Salad is better than Outback! Their bacon is delicious, cooked perfectly. So great burgers, chili fries, and a shake delivered to my house and I have till 11p.m. to order.
Sign me up!
2 nd order this week and many more to come."}
{"text":"Best Patty Melt I've had in years."}
{"text":"The Ghost Pepper Burger is the best! I love this place...friendly, clean, fast and great burgers! If you enjoy a good burger..this is the spot to be."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight with my boyfriend for my first time and his second. Ordered the bacon and egg burger and added grilled pineapple. Burger is so juicy and delicious and the bacon was crispy and thick! Not like the dog chow bacon from subway. Boyfriend got the turkey burger for the second time and swears by it. Next time I want to try the hula hula (comes with grilled ham, pineapple and teriyaki!!) truly impressed by the quality of our food and not to mention the amazing customer service. One of the managers, Quentin, came out to our table to make sure everything was okay and really seemed to take pride in the restaurant. He was truly personable and very welcoming. 

I truly don't understand the bad reviews on this place. It should be assumed that the drive through will require a wait. These burgers are made to order and are not your basic cheeseburgers. If you take a look at their menu, they are all specialty and handcrafted. I definitely would reccomend this place to anyone and will definitely be back. They even deliver!! Awesome food and service, really look forward to my next visit :)"}
{"text":"It was really good the first time we ordered. Fast, and the food was excellent. The last couple of times we have ordered it was okay. This last time was the worst. It was fast getting here, which was great. However the food quality lacked. The chicken tenders were dry, and the chicken sandwich I ordered was lazily thrown together. I couldn't eat it. It was a sloppy mess. We won't be ordering from them again. Maybe visiting the restaurant would be a different experience. So I'm not going to completely knock them. However for ordering,  I don't think so."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but the first time I was there I wasn't told about the burger special fron 2-4. I came back the next week and ordered the burger special but the cashier wasn't sure what burger was included with the special. Apparently cheeseburgers aren't included or the cheese is really expensive. Whataburger is about as good with much better service."}
{"text":"My husband and i are here at burger rush for the first time today... From the momment we walked in we both agree this place is great... The service was exellent. The food was boom. Adam had chilli cheese burger with fries and i had the steak and avacodo salad with oreo shake. Very big proptions. fries was light and crisp ... The owner / Manager ? Was walking around talking with all the customers . very friendly... Both adam and i will be coming back weekly ... Love this place ....."}
{"text":"I tried coming to Burger Rush around 1 AM a few times last week only to find they were closed each time. The hours listed claim them to be open until 3 AM every night. 

Still willing to give it a try, I went around 4:30 PM. I ordered a patty melt and fried zucchini. The patty melt was pretty good. I would order it again. The zucchini was okay. I ordered a small, but they gave me A LOT.  Not the best I've had. I would probably stick to fries here next time. 

If you're looking for a burger, it's not a bad place. I do think there's better burger places out there, but it's nice to be able to get patty melts and pastrami sandwiches."}
{"text":"I used delivery and had the Cibatta Bleu Burger. It was so tasty and big.  The fries were the kind I like. I just forgot to ask for no salt on the fries. I am not much for salt. The blue cheese tasted more like roquefort, which I like. I cannot stop talking or praising that flavour. Just unbelievably good. I would order again. Just remember, you need a big appetite for this burger or make 2 meals of it."}
{"text":"things were mediocre. fries were not crisp enough. kid at the register didn't seem to know anything,. I asked for a recommendation and he was pretty clueless. great location, but needs a bit of improvement"}
{"text":"Worst delivery experience I'm ever had! 
I placed an order here on a Friday night around 10:30 at 11:00 I received a call from the driver saying he couldn't find my house. It turns out that he was about 20 minutes away on the other side of PHX. I explained where I was, and he said that he would be here shortly about 10 minutes later I received another call from home asking for directions again, and another 10 minutes later he said that he was pulling into the area and then I had to stay on the phone with him for 3 minutes explaining each turn he had to take, and even then he couldn't manage to find my house. I finally just came out to the street to wave him down. The entire thing was incredibly frustrating! This place is less than 10 minutes from my house! Don't their drivers know he immediate surrounding area? If not don't they have GPS?

So after an hour when I finally got my food it was cold, the buns were soggy, and it was disgusting and inedible! I suppose the food may have been good if it was warm, but I guess I'll never know."}
{"text":"I'm impressed! I like to dig into my fries right off the bat, and I was immediately satisfied. Perfect amount of seasoning and salt. I also had the Hula burger and I thought the flavor combinations were fantastic. The bun was slightly soggy, but that could be my fault for getting a burger delivered to my house. I also snagged a bite of my friends Ghost pepper burger and it also had great flavor and was cooked really well. His bun wasn't soggy (so I think it could have just been the burger ingredients on mine). All in all a great pick! 

Only negative was not including napkins!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good food, fresh, and decently speedy. Only problem, customer service. They seem to heavy sigh if I ask for extra cheese or no onions. It seems extra steps, are a pain in the butt. Im a cook myself, I know the little tedious things are a pain, but c'mon. Im paying the full amount, Im always really nice, and I don't like making the workers feel stupid. But Darn it, if I want my chili cheese fries a certain way, and pay for it, can't I just have it done without attitude? Please and thank you. P.S., I keep coming back because its delicious. At some point Ill draw the line, just not now."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero star like many people on here. Having said that more than likely I'm going to have someone's job tomorrow. I go into the drive thru and look at the prices it's nine dollars for a meal, at that point I'm not surprised as I looked at the reviews. I get a chicken tender and fries. It says on that board 4.99 and I'm expecting to 5.39 nope the attendant says 6.89 and I pull up and ask if it's a mistake, and she tells me that her register says 5.99. I then informed her that her sign has the wrong number, and she spoke again saying that the price ragardless of the sign. I asked for her manager, she used the classic line I am the manager. It was the most pretntious, and disrespectful tone I ever heard. We will be talking to her manager in the morning, if you want to be treated like a bum begging for food your going to pay for go there, as for me... I'll be visiting jack in the box."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for an all american, juicy, and messy burger this is the place to go! Not only are the burgers amazing, so are the fries and Shake i got along with it. And the serving sizes are huge! So you really get your money's worth. I will defiantly ordering from here again, also another side note, delivery is faster than Hungry Howies!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but ordered a burger and fries and going on 2 hours with no delivery.  Called twice to confirm order and both times was told 20 min.  Unfortunate service on a Wednesday night at now 11pm that I've been told they are too busy to get to deliveries.  Won't be eating from there anymore."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try a new burger place today  but i had a surprise and a half . I ordered a meal  . I want to open my soda to eat the ice and what did i find ........a cockroach in my soda ....i was so disgusted i nearly threw  up on top of it my 9 year old daughter had also drank out of my cup ........ I called the store manager and all she said is \"Im so sorry we have been spraying because next door had a cockroach problem \" she refunded my money but that doesn't  make up for a pest a site being in my drink....and all she could say is \"If you need anything just let me no \" i called the health inspection department so here's hoping they put a stop to all this   and here's hoping we don't get sick ......so if you fill like eating a burger don't go to the rush ....."}
{"text":"Here is my second review for Burger Rush. This wonderful restaurant continues to branch out and is not simply a burger joint. Recently they have added Spaghetti and Meatballs which I tried a few days ago. Good pasta and sauce and TERRIFIC meatballs! Today, I tried the newest addition...Fish and Chips. Great hand breaded cod! Truly a must try!"}
{"text":"Great staff and a great collection of interesting burgers. I had the Ortega Burger and my wife had the Hula Hula Burger, both were AMAZING, huge portions and great fries. I had a fun conversation with the woman taking my order and she was able to describe all the burgers to me so I knew exactly what was on each, she also noticed my Doctor Who shirt so points for her haha.

All in all it's a fantastic joint and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We ordered using Amazon Prime. This is our 4th time to order.  The last few times I gave Burger Rush 5 Stars. This time, I'm going between a 3 and 4.  Yesterday we got our order in record time.  Everything looked good except our gyros were wrapped in tortillas. 
The gyros became gyrittos!  I guess they ran out of pitas."}
{"text":"Good sized portions for a decent price. Great tasting food too. Nothing bad that I can say here."}
{"text":"If you use the drive thru check for all paid items..I made the mistake of not checking and my fries were not in the bag. I did get a double cheeseburger combo...the burger was really good..it's was huge,won't get it again just because it was to much of a burger for me to handle so I'm happy my fries weren't added. I don't know how good the fries are obviously. I also got the carrot cake..it's the was good,big slice and tasted fresh. I will go here again. Service was slow,but I'm hoping it was because they were making the food fresh..it's the tasted like it."}
{"text":"Place is incredibly good. Everything I have tried has been best quality compared to the other the local restaurants."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Tastes like any other charbroiled fast food burger. Onion rings are unimpressive as well. Staff was very friendly but the food doesn't make me want to bring friends or spread the word. There are better options within a mile of this place."}
{"text":"I am a pregnant woman and eating raw meat is a big no-no!! I am actually concerned at this point. I ordered a chicken sandwich combo (Large fry and Large Drink w/ a side of ranch). The chicken was charred on the outside to the point where nothing I could do would get rid of the taste of burnt chicken. It does not end there, I bit into my sandwich a second time and its rubbery (like uncooked chicken). So at this point I rip the chicken in half to see uncooked chicken under the surface of the charred top. My drink arrived looking like someone spilled it on the way to my home as well. Fries were skimpy! Now I am very sick, just ate raw meat and got unsatisfactory customer service from the male that answered the phone. He offered to issue a refund, and when I kindly asked him to address this with the cook/s he nonchalantly said he \"most likely\" will. What is \"most likely\"?!!!! Don't eat here, poor service, very poor. Fries were cold and stale as well..."}
{"text":"Pulled in thinking I was going to Wendy's but this place had bought the location and was fairly busy so I thought I would give them a try.
Asked for a double cheeseburger combo and paid $7
Wait was fairly long and when my order showed up at the table it was just a cheeseburger not a double. Looked at the receipt and that's what I was charged for so I took it.
Big bun lots of veggies but idk how they get the patty so thin. Could barely taste any meat and it was pink!
Couldn't tell if the burger was cold inside our not with all the cold lettuce and tomato.
Could've had any number of other burgers for the $ and they would have all been better.
Also they have the soda fountain with \"100 choices\" but there was more choices sold out than there were avail"}
{"text":"Took one bite and threw my whole meal out. Cold soggy uncooked fries, grosser burger."}
{"text":"WARNING***** the chicken on the Spicy Chicken Sandwich is CHICKEN FRIED STEAK!!!!  

I would give them zero stars if I could... here's why...
I walked into the establishment and went to the counter.  There was a long haired blonde lady behind the register. I asked her what was on the veggie wrap. She said \"Honestly, I dont know. I have never eaten that\" and stared blankly back at me waiting for me to order.  I then said \"Does anyone here know what is on the veggie wrap?\" She asked the cook and he replied \"Veggies.\"  Well no s***.  I asked him to elaborate. He said \"Uhm, cucumber, lettuce, tomato.....oh and mushrooms!\" I decided to not get this due to the fact that no one could even describe what was on it.  I proceeded to order a Spicy Chicken Sandwich and my companion ordered a Classic Burger, fries and a drink.  We handed the lady 20.00 and she gave me back 3.00 in quarters, stating that she no longer had ones.  We waited 12 minutes for our food even though we were the only ones waiting for food in the establishment. Upon receiving my Spicy Chicken Sandwich, I took a bite (luckily small) and noticed the meat was a dark shade of gray and had the consistency of a rubber tire.  Upon asking for a refund, the cook stated that its a \"Chicken-steak mixture, kind of like a chicken fried steak.\"  He then proceeded to offer a chicken nugget consistency type chicken sandwich.  It was 6.25 for the sandwich only.  I would expect a delicious, juicy, tender piece of chicken, not a mixture of steak and chicken.  There was no apology for the disgusting piece of meat I received. Also, the burger my companion received was a meat patty of approximately 2cm in height. The fixings were the cheapest shredded ice-burg lettuce, a thinly sliced tomato, and enough thousand island to kill a horse.  The fries were salty and soggy, if thats your fancy, get the fries only."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by both menu and atmosphere. Their menu is much more extensive than the name would suggest. Zucchini fries are not heavily battered and remind me of my grandmother's. Gyro was fresh and good. Fifties music was a nice touch mixed with modern pop!"}
{"text":"Firstly, they do not allow their special as a take out, so as a working woman who does not have time to sit at a restaurant for lunch, I don't get to enjoy the specials? Maybe I don't get out much but that was definitely a first. So I place an order for delivery and what arrived was not what I ordered,  despite the fact that the delivery guy checked and assured me the order was correct. I asked for a wheat bun and did not get one, they say their burgers come with lettuce, pickles, onions, tomatoes, and a sauce, my \"burger\" was a wet bun, a pattie and some cheese (mainly stuck to the foil and paper wrapper. Then to top it all off, the fries were stale, like leftover reheated fries and were not edible in my opinion. This was my first and will be my LAST meal at Burger Rush, what you get is definitely NOT worth what you pay for!! TERRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"I ordered via the Eat24 app and my veggie burger was undercooked, mushy, and soggy, not to mention cold. I notified Eat24 of this and they had me take a picture and email it to them. Not only that, the restaurant was so petty that they wanted to pick the inedible mess up before they would refund my money. I will never order from either again!"}
{"text":"I'm no food critic, but I do know a good burger when I taste one. About a week or so I stopped in here and I wrote about the steak sandwich, this evening I decided to stop again but this time I had a burger and fries. The burger was awesome. I don't like to give five stars, but I gave four for the steak sandwich, so I think they deserve five.
The people are friendly, they came over to my table for friendly banter, and to see if I liked the burger. Even though I was in a hurry, just wanted to eat and leave, it was a welcomed change from the norm."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable prices, and no surprises. Fries are excellent. Cake was like heaven. All delivered."}
{"text":"The food tasted great but I did not receive the correct order. It was delievered timely but I did not receive two items that I ordered."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely great. However I ordered food online, waited over an hour and half, and once I call the guy tells me \"it hasn't been shipped out yet\". Hoping I would be satisfied by that answer. I then ask if my food had even been made yet. NO, it wasn't even made yet!
That place is way too slow At every given time to not have completed what must have been only their 7th order of the day. They won't be getting my money again."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed. Paying a dollar for a \"hamburger\" that's the size of my fingernail is ridiculous. Also had to pay for ranch that wasnt even in the bag. Your workers need to figure out how to put things in the bag that people pay for, and learn consistency. I can't believe someone literally looked at that and thought that was a normal size and put that in the bag. I've gone here before once and it was a normal size. Btw I have never written a review before but this was ridiculous.."}
{"text":"Updated 9/12/14 to 2 stars:

Pretty much stopped going here, after being a big fan early on.

1) Drive-Thru: The order is wrong EVERY single &%$&* time in the last 8 times I've been here. I can't leave the drive-through without taking everything out of the bag and making sure it's all correct, and it never is anymore unless I order 1 single item - and even then they never offer you the sauce or dip the order comes with.

2) Delivery: Tried it once, never again. An hour and a half after ordering, it arrives but just like the drive-thru, the order is mostly wrong, items are omitted, but in this case the poor driver has to go back and we have to wait another 30 min for the rest of the order.

To the phone and drive-thru order-takers: Coke is not the same thing as the other drinks we ordered, and a small side is not the same as a large side especially when we're paying for the latter. It's not an arguable point.

3) Food: The burger has fallen apart, both figuratively and literally. It hasn't tasted good in a while now, no longer tastes like a smoke-grilled burger, which set it apart from the fast food chains down the street. It doesn't really have a taste anymore beyond the tomato and cheap cheese. The last 5 burgers have been a lopsided mess; having to scrape off and throw away soaked and liquid-squishy bottom buns kind of ruins it. And the shredded lettuce falling out everywhere got old quick.


I hung in there hoping it was just a temporary loss of quality control (employee turnover, etc), but when each of at least the last half-dozen visits have been nothing but hassle and disappointment the problem appears to be with ownership, management, and lack of employee training or poor treatment. Nobody there now seems to give a crap about getting the order right and rather than call back or check with you at the window to clarify, they just substitute whatever they want when they forget what you ordered and let you get home to discover the surprise.

I've had enough surprises and short-changing on orders, looking elsewhere now.


===============================================

Old 4-star review:

It's a burger joint that isn't Burger King, McD's, etc. Their burger meat usually* has a char grilled/smokey flavor that tastes better than the engineered flavor replacements mcD's, BK, etc use.

Their fries are GREAT - nothing like the soggy/floppy McD's or ounce-of-salt-per-fry BK fries. They're fresh and cooked just right (balanced between soft and crisp) and usually* there's plenty of them in your order.

Their fried zucchini and ranch are GREAT every time, we've never been disappointed with it. We're told they make their own ranch dip, and I can give them the benefit of the doubt on that because it's really really good, seems far better than I usually get elsewhere. 

Their chicken sandwich is pretty good too, and has some spices that adds a lot of character to it. My GF says their fish sandwich is pretty good as well.

The staff have been friendly, professional, accommodating, and usually* the order is correct.

Some others have commented about long drive-thru waits. It does take longer than the chain fast food places (about 8-10 minutes from the time you pull up to place the order) but that's because they cook it fresh to order here. I've never had stale, dried-out food, so for me the extra few minutes are totally worth it and not a negative thing.

Overall, we really like the food and we get take-out from there routinely, at least once every 1-2 weeks."}
{"text":"One star? They don't even deserve that. I ordered 50.00 worth of food. Got the wrong thing and items missing.  Naturally, I call to get my correct order.  Talk to a girl tell her what happened she told me someone would call back.  Some guy called back telling me he would waive my order fee. So I go with it and re order my food.  I waited about 15 min and my order came.  Along with a rude guy with attitude.  He asked me how I was going to pay.  I said pay what? He said I needed to pay for my order.  I was told it would be waived.  Then he said he would trade me the sandwich they gave me for the sandwich I wanted. Which goes against all sanitation rules. And It  had already been eaten by a coworker. I paid for it, I can give it to who I want.  This guy continues to argue with me IN MY PLACE OF WORK, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OFFICE about how my order was wrong and that I need to pay attention to what I'm ordering. And said if I didn't order the wrong sandwich who did! I'm in awe are you serious!?!? You screw up an order and it's my fault.  If I'm correct the customer is always right.  Hmmmm. Y'all have terrible customer service. If you're going to come to someone's place of business you should have respect.  Plain and simple.  I'm not even mad about the food.  I'm mad at how I was treated then was told I'd have to basically pay double for a sandwich! So wrong on so many levels. If you order from this place don't order through grub hub! If you're order is messed up they won't take action over their mistakes and try to charge you for it."}
{"text":"Bomb af better than 5 guys, cheapest burger is 5 dollars but it's a good size and tastes awesome"}
{"text":"They were sooo late! They told me it would be ready in an hour and 2 hours later it still didn't arrive. I've had this place before and then have gotten consistently worse."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through about 11 pm after the ASU-Stanford game; the place was not real busy and there were at least four employees I could see...the service to be honest, was just awful. We had to repeat and repeat and wait and wait and then repeat again, and well....I ended up keeping the signed receipt because I got tired of holding it out the window for the cashier to come get it, after five minutes I set it down in the car and forgot about it. So did the cashier. I know they got paid though my card was charged. 

But the food was incredibly good. I had a Mushroom Burger. my son had a double burger. The fries were hot and delicious, the burgers huge and delicious. And so despite the service we'll probably come back again."}
{"text":"Burger was big and looked so good but wasn't flavorful. Chili was nasty in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ordered the Ruben melt to go - they boxed it up in enclosed box, by the time I  arrived home it was very soggy. Fries also got soggy.  $19 for two meals 

While waiting in the drive through saw one of the delivery drivers go from his car straight to the kitchen. Not sure 100% if he was cooking but he was handling somebody's food. Also checked his text messages on his phone and wiped the sweat off his face, scratched his eyes (he was wearing vision glasses) - no gloves while handling food in kitchen. 

I called to give my feedback was fresh food if I came back.  The person that answered the phone was not that interested in my feedback (he said he was one of the managers). 

I wanted to like this place - will give it another try someday but this was a bad first time experience."}
{"text":"This is my third time getting food from this establishment. The first time going I was not too impressed by what I got. The second time, the food was a little bit better. I do like the zucchini  sticks. The third time coming here I now realize why there are rarely many people eating here. There was this girl at the register, she was a bit rude. While I was waiting for over 20 minutes for my 3 milkshakes I overheard her having a conversation with a customer about the gumball she was chewing. Before assisting this customer, she put 25 cents into the candy machine and put the gumball in her mouth. She was apologizing to the customer because she had a gumball in her mouth and continued to talk about how hard they are. This baffled me, as I myself manage a restaurant. This was extremely unprofessional of her to chew on any sort of food while working. This should never happen in any food establishment. Utter unprofessional-ism and disrespect to the place she works at. This is three strikes and your out. I will just make my zucchini myself."}
{"text":"Driving by today at lunchtime. Was actually on my way to try out the new Shake Shack but made a detour here. It wasn't very busy for lunch time so that should have been a red flag. Restaurant was clean. Service was friendly. Ordered a double burger and fries, pretty simple eh? Service wasn't exactly slow but should have been quicker given that it wasn't all that busy. On the first bite I realized the burger was just lukewarm. The fries were plentiful and hot and I assumed they let the burger sit while the fries were cooking. After 2-3 bites I couldn't continue. I told staff and the owner, who was nearby, appeared and I received a new order in about 5 minutes. The burger was hot this time and cooked well. While it was tasty   enough you can't convince me that my burger patties were fresh/never frozen as they claim. The fries have the same or similar coating that Burger King fries have and that is disgusting, at least to me. I don't want any coating on my fries, just the potato please. The self-serve soda fountain is a nice touch but wasn't calibrated right so the diet coke was a little too syrupy. All in all, I'd give it a 5 on the 0-10 scale. Will I be back? Well, I probably wouldn't make any special effort to go there but if I was starving and driving by I'd think about giving them a 2nd chance and try something other than the burgers/fries."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today. It was obviously a Wendy's in a past life. There wasn't much done to make it look any different than Wendy's. If you were blindfolded, brought inside and then had the blindfold removed, I'd bet most people would initially say that they were inside a Wendy's. The tables hadn't been bused in a while. Crumbs and order #'s littered the tabletops. The decor was...meh. I love going to new (local) spots to see how they chose to decorate and brand their business. Some understand how to do this and the importance behind it...Oreganos, Pita Jungle, Cheba Hut, Cornish Pasty, etc. This placed lacked all of that...to the point that I couldn't remember the name (I thought it was Burger Hut) when it came time to write this review. As for the staff, they were friendly and helpful. 

Now, on to the food! I had the Avocado Bacon Cheese burger. The patty was definitely higher quality than Wendy's ;) The bacon was thick cut, REAL bacon!! The fries were crispy on the outside and had perfect consistency on the inside. I love ranch, so naturally I asked for a side to dip my fries in. The ranch was thick and had the homemade flavor you can only find when visiting small town restaurants in places like Scobey, Montana...YUM! It was a huge side too!! 

-1 star for decor and ambiance
-1 star for unkempt tables

The food and customer service were great and this place has a lot of potential! Bus the tables more frequently and give your place a fresh, unique look :)"}
{"text":"I'll start with a compliment. The fries are fantastic.

But, the burger was completely underwhelming. I'm seeing some positive reviews about the burger so I wonder if they have changed anything since I went in a month ago or so. My burger was an obviously pre-frozen patty that was cooked to well-done destruction. Bun and toppings were Meh. It's a burger so they didn't screw anything up to the point of being unedible. So if you want Meh go for it.

The place is a shade above your Burger King or McDonald's but for the price, or if you want a GOOD burger, there's no reason not to go to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Haven't had their burgers but just had the breakfast and it is mediocre at best. I ordered a Denver omelette and I got an over cooked omelette smothered in cheese. The homegrown are soggy and disgusting. Friendly staff tho but I wouldn't spend my money here again and neither should you regardless of your expectations."}
{"text":"They were awesome, I'm expecting  and they were kind enough to make me breakfast even though they stop serving it. At a certian time, I didn't get it until 2 but I was more than happy with it. They even misread my order and made sure to remake it and have it sent to me again. Quickly and promptly, Very wonderful service. And I'm all about breakfast at the moment so having it for lunch is a plus!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time on this place. Went through the drive thru for a late dinner after a long day. It was 30 minutes before we received our full order. Employees blamed it on deliveries and being short staffed. I worked in the food industry for 8 years and have NEVER had a company receive deliveries at 10pm on a Friday night. There were no delivery trucks outside of any kind. 

Fries were cold, burger was cold and bland. Fish was burning hot, but soggy. Almost like they made the fish, forgot about it, then popped it in the microwave. Bread was soggy. Tartar sauce was gross. Offered us $10 store credit for our next order, but we don't have any high hopes for that."}
{"text":"Always on time with their devilry service! Burger Rush is defiantly Clutch! Highly recommend this burger joint for any one who is hunger!"}
{"text":"Great fries with yummy seasoning. The ranch dressing is amazing! Burger had a great, charbroiled flavor and was cooked perfectly and served on a soft sesame seed bun. The pickles, shredded lettuce, and chopped onions were fresh and crisp. I did request the Thousand Island dressing on the side, but  it came on the burger, which made my bun a bit soggy. Also, I ordered a diet coke and got regular coke. Delivery took about 40 minutes, and I was estimated 75-90 minutes, so that was a pleasant surprise. Food was a bit cold on delivery, but the GrubHub driver got lost. He picked up my food at 2:07 and didn't arrive until 2:35. The restaurant is only a 10 minute drive from my office, so had he not been lost for 20 minutes, the food likely wouldn't have been cold. Maybe a bit more attention-to-detail would have earned them 5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"Seriously best burger place in town. I've tried pretty much everything from their burgers to their salads to their nachos. Its all delicious! Make sure you get a milkshake while you are there. Best damn shakes in town!"}
{"text":"Not consistent, left me ill 

For what it's worth I have enjoyed the food I've gotten at Burger Rush. I've been there three times but I won't be returning. The third visit left me with a stomach ache that kept me on the couch or in bed for half the day. This is corroborated by my friend whom I dined with and experienced the same symptoms the next day. (We don't live with one another and that was the only occasion that week when we were together, or ate together) Each visit it seemed as though the food was different, the burgers and the fries, but specifically the fries. (Ranging from soggy, to too much batter, not enough) These three visits to Burger Rush were within the first two months they were open, so I can excuse the inconsistency, but there is no excuse for poor quality food or poorly cooked food that leaves their customers with stomach pains. In addition, I was very disappointed that they didn't have sweet potato tots, which are on the menu but apparently they don't carry them (I've unsuccessfully ordered them three times ha). Service was mediocre, and often took a while to receive your food, specifically for a burger joint with a drive thru. I've waited 20 minutes for two burgers in their drive thru. Overall really disappointed, I live in the neighborhood and have a demand for a burger joint that's open past last call.  On the plus side, after a peek at the other reviews, it doesn't seem as though anyone else has gotten ill from eating at Burger Rush. Could have been isolated, but once is one too many, not taking my chances."}
{"text":"I am IN LOVE with the food, service, prices, EVERYTHING ABOUT BURGER RUSH! Only had it 3 times and each time something different, awesome fast delivery, and the best foooood!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I feel like I've had everything on the menu. My favorite thing is root beer floats delivered to my door. And they deliver."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Stopped in for breakfast and I was shocked at how delicious it was. I got a bacon burrito. First of all it's huge. Second, totally insane. Packed with home fries and perfectly crisp bacon. I can't believe I never tried this place before. Super interested in trying a burger now."}
{"text":"Impressed with the size of burger. Good portions for the price. Excellent deal on the eat24 for 4 burgers, fries and drinks. My fries were warm, not really hot. Really wasn't expecting fountain sodas. The expected delivery was right on time! I was too tired and lazy to go anywhere, so greatly appreciated a good meal that wasn't pizza: )"}
{"text":"I love the delivery service every driver i have had has gone out of their way for me. Yesterday my fries were forgotten i suggested a credit, but the driver insisted  on returning with hot fries and he did. I have wanted to try the steak sand for some time its a bit pricey but yesterday i couldn't resist. I added a swiss cheese, it came without  and the bread was a bit hard 3 thick slices of tomato was over whelming for 1 piece of leaf lettuce the presentation did nothing to help the sandwich  decent thin slices of meat with bread. I asked if the sandwich would be hot and was told yes perhaps  she misunderstood the meat was warm but the bread wasn't even slightly toasted anyways I took the sandwich apart added cheese to both sides of bread and put them in the toaster oven i sliced the meat into strips and put them in a frying pan until the cheese melted added more lettuce and ate only half. I really like their burgers the ckn Cesar wrap, fries, onion rings , shakes, I love it all But the pricey sandwich with added cheese about 9$ don't make happy. I didnt even care about the fries that was no problem. But the lack of effort in designing and making the sandwich is very disappointing. I should have called to complain but im not asking for anything for free that's all I would have gotten I just would have appreciated more effort in such an expensive sandwich."}
{"text":"I don't eat beef but I was in the mood for a turkey burger.  I saw this place opened up nearby and I decided to give it a chance.  

My take? don't get the turkey burger and only get the onion rings if you like to eat a weeks worth of salt in one meal.  Blah

Also, on a Saturday night I saw three customers besides myself."}
{"text":"Second time eating here; I ordered the Ortega burger, it was delicious and cooked all the way through. Also, I ordered a .49¢ Classic burger since it was after 5pm. I ditched the bread and just ate the patty, it was a bit red still in the middle. Can't complain that much though, it was .49¢!

Overall the burgers are decent and well priced. Get your order to go, they left both front doors open because it was nice outside. This backfired because the flies started coming in from outside and were pestering me in the dining room during my meal. The staff was nice, and were happy to help."}
{"text":"Great food and service but probably too overpriced for the area. Its in an old Mcdonalds that could even be competitive in the area."}
{"text":"Burgers are excellent. Service is mediocre, but they had just opened when I 1st went, so I'm hoping the service issue is fixed by now. 5/5 due to how good their burgers are!"}
{"text":"Awesome little burger place that took over an old Wendy's location and remodeled it very tastefully. Food is really good for the money. The bacon egg burger is awesome. Make sure you ask questions though, the menu is so large there are no descriptions.

Coca Cola freestyle machine gives a lot of drink choices. The location is always kept clean. I want this place to survive."}
{"text":"Had a cheeseburger. Sign says 100% fresh, I have a hard time believing that. Patties look pre formed. Onion rings looked pre battered. As another reviewer wrote burger was cold. Cheese was not melted. Bun was dry. Looked good, so points for presentation. The onion rings I got were mostly the small middle pieces and ended up very oily and soggy. The normal size pieces were good. Probably will not go back based on the below average burger."}
{"text":"Decent. The burger is plentiful and a bit above average in price, but I'm not complaining. With a name like Burger Rush you'd expect burgers, BUT!! It has an extensive breakfast menu, omelette, breakfast burrito, pancakes & toast, egg skillet, sandwiches, salads, and of course dessert. Whew!! Choices. The staff is great and it will take some time in gaining momentum, but overall, very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have held back on reviewing this place as it may have just been an off night. This is the 3rd time i have had a bad experience and i am done with Burger Rush. The first time i had an issue, the delivery guy was 2 hrs late. Last time there was only half my order. But this time takes the fucking cake. They cancelled my order through Grub Hub because they were too busy and cant fulfill the order. Grub Hub wont do anything. Im getting apologies but no action. No resolution. I ordered food not you flapping your lips at me because you fucked up. I am officially done ordering anything from this poorly run, shitty business."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, we noticed it was kind of slow. So our service may have been greater due to this, maybe not. 
The cashier answered all our questons regarding what was in the burgers we were interested in. He was extremely helpful recommending burgers. I wish they'd include what each burger had on a smaller menu, but it's not that difficult to simply ask either. 
The largest drink is a 32oz. They have the Coke machine that has all the different types of drinks and flavors. That's always great. 
Everything was clean and organized. Our meal came within 5-10 minutes. 
I got the Hula Hula Burger (around $8 with fries) which has your basic trimmings on it, plus ham, swiss, extremely juicy pineapple, and teriyaki sauce. It was a pretty big burger. I struggled to take bites, but thats not even bad! 
The fries were incredible! Someone else mentioned they're a little on the soggy side. I'm a fan of this so I was thrilled. If you like them this way, they're really heavenly. If you prefer crispy, let them know. I'm sure they'll make adjustments!
I'll definitely be going back. I live nearby and they deliver so I'll be taking advantage of that! 
I wish they would get a tip jar because everything was so wonderful and they definitely deserved it!

Tldr; The service, establishment, burgers, fries, and drinks are great. The price is a tiny bit higher than BK or McDonald's, but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great new concept. Fast food set up with a menu larger than all other fast food joints. My friend ordered a burger and I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap. This place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Good burgers at a fair price. I got the classic double cheese burger with bacon, mushrooms, and jalapenos. But I do wish the jalapeño were hotter. Good seating and well lit."}
{"text":"We decided we didn't feel like going out for dinner but didn't want the same ol pizza and delivery. Found this place on grub hub.  Fast delivery and the food was hot and delish! I would go five stars but they don't have veggie burgers! With so many burgers and no veggie patty substitute I was surprised! Please consider adding so I can try one of your burgers out!  I opted for tuna melt..yum! The man got a burger and he loved it. We will be getting again!"}
{"text":"That have advertised on their window burgers for .49 after 3pm what u don't know is that it's after buying a reg priced meal. Besides false advertisement I've only done drivethru and every time I go I've waited over 20 minutes at the window for my food. I went this morning bc on yelp it says open at 8 am well the girl there said they aren't open til 9 so that was a waste. Other then this they have good food and I know some employees that work there are good ppl"}
{"text":"It's one of the best places I've ever been to  I had a breakfast burrito and some fried zucchini that was to die for  the ranch was home made and it was delicious n thick, but the burritos was ok , however my hubs order a burger and fries and of course I had to tried them and it was Delish , definitely our new burger spot when we come back to Tempe"}
{"text":"I don't know what the complainers on here are thinking.  BR is good, really good, like legendary old burger stand good.  I had the colossal burger, it's huge, stacked with pastrami.  Everything was cooked perfectly and it was fairly quick (not mcdonalds quick) made from scratch quick.  They have enough options that if you ordered something you don't like then you probably didn't take the time to craft the right order.  The staff took the time to help us newbies with the menu and made awesome suggestions.  Give them a chance, it's a good joint that we need in Tempe.  They also DELIVER!"}
{"text":"The bbq chicken salad is legit. The omelettes are pretty damn good too. The burgers are trash though. The fried foods are ok. I haven't had a bad experience there is just better stuff out there for the same price."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying this place but it took 2 hours to deliver to my house. When I called to ask where my order was, the woman on the phone told me the driver should be arriving soon. It took another 30 minutes until he arrived. By this time, we were starving. As we removed our food from the bag it was ice cold. The fries were soggy and not even a hint of warmth, our burgers were ice cold as well. I called back and the manager on duty place me on hold for a while and then asked if I wanted him to remake the food. Honestly, I told him I didn't want to wait another 2 hours for food. He offered to credit back my account which was pretty cool of him but I have yet to see the credit applied. I don't think I will give this place another try due to the disgustingly cold food."}
{"text":"First time here with my daughter's and I must say they food and price was perfect! I got the hula burger and it was so yummy.. And the fries wow so good!, my girls got the pm special and for the price $ 4.99 you get a Jr burger, fries, drink and a dessert!!  Service was great..  Definitely will be back.."}
{"text":"This place would have been good if any one of the items we ordered was correct. The melt I ordered with no onions add tomato and mayo had no mayo and no tomato and extra unions. the hot dog my boyfriend order with Extra cheese had no cheese and comes fully loaded which they don't seem to tell you online on the description. And both the salads were wrong as well. The steak n avocado salad doesn't really come with avocado and the Greek salad I guess atomically comes with ranch because I ordered Balsamic vinaigrette. The delivery time was fine and the driver was overly pleasent. I don't normally normally leave bad reviews since I work in the food industry myself. But not when every item ordered was done wrong."}
{"text":"A burger place that delivers!!  Tried this place for the first time by getting delivery.  I got the avocado and bacon burger, fries, onion rings and a reeses shake.  Seriously delicious.  The food was still warm when I received it.  It came in a carrier box. Not a bag which was nice because I was able to just eat out of the box.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  Onion rings were delicious as well.  I will definitely be getting food from here again, but to eat in next time to check out the scene."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place, fresh, unique burgers and chicken sandwices. The fried zucchini was bomb and the broccoli too! But last weekend we went, through the drive thru, and the food was NOT AT ALL what it once was. The fried zucchini was barely warm, and had obviously been made prior and kept luke warm under a heat lamp. I ordered a gyro, which had barely any meat on it at all. We were really disappointed, since this place used to be a favorite burger joints around! It seems that things are not fresh, generous or put much care into anymore..I guess thats what happens when a small business gets off its feet a bit...it begins cutting corners. What a shame. Now we just go to in and out instead. I'll miss the quality that burger rush once had."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on a business trip and looking for food. We ordered from here and I must say... the burgers are GREAT!!! We ordered through Grub Hub, the food was on time, the fries were still hot.  We actually ordered from them a second time.  I will definitely order from there again when I am in Phoenix.  I would recommend to anyone looking for burgers. The delivery guy was pleasant.  Best burger in a LONG time."}
{"text":"I really liked the burger! The chipotle sauce was very spicy and the bread was good. The fries were fantastic!"}
{"text":"BR is okay. I can only speak for the classic cheeseburger, but it was pretty meh; and a little on the expensive side for what you are getting- $6 just for the burger. This means a meal is closer to 11$ for fast food takeout. Service was very friendly, but the food lacked a wow quality."}
{"text":"I think the food is pretty good, definitely better than other chain fast food. The prices are right on the line of being too high. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is the customer service. Typically you'll get something between a jaded teenager and the soup nazi. The food also takes a long time to make, for a drive thru. 

I'd also recommend not ordering delivery. The order took almost two hours and the food was cold. If I eat here, I  only pick it up. 

If they improved their employees attitudes and sped up the service, this place would be way more popular."}
{"text":"The best burger in Arizona! Hands-down! If you make the trip to Tempe Arizona this is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Nothing to say except  for service is downright horrid. Place just sucks"}
{"text":"Call to place a delivery order guy answers the phone doesn't really know his ass from a hole in the ground  tells me almost no real info except I have to go through grub hub to place an order and can't order over the phone   so I guess you have a GM that would rather pay grub hub to take an order than to do it your lazy ass self what a joke this is an area that has LOTS of other options"}
{"text":"Clean, nice staff, but the burgers are underseasoned. Love that they offer whole wheat buns."}
{"text":"Such a eclectic menu and we tried everything from the tacos, frenchfries, milkshakes, salads & a Greek platter. Everything was fresh, delicious & served with a smile. It's roomy, clean &  There was fun music playing in the background,  everything from doowop to Rihanna.  I am hooked & will be back."}
{"text":"Well we made the trek from Gilbert to Tempe specifically to get burgers and onion rings from this place because my mother in law raved about the o-rings. 

Not impressed honestly. Here's why, while the onion rings were actually really good, the burgers left SO much to be desired! We ordered an ABC (avocado, bacon and cheese) burger with no lettuce or tomato (picky brother in law), a spicy chicken sandwich (the wife) and a patty melt (for myself). My patty melt was pretty greasy as one should expect from a patty melt, but it didn't seem to come from the burger, but from the butter on the bread or onions because the burger itself was really dry and honestly spongy in the worst way possible. It definitely had the texture of either being previously frozen OR the burger mix was severely overmixed, to the point of being more of a burger batter than a ground meat patty. I snuck a bite of my brother in laws burger (for science!!) and it was EXACTLY the same texture. Like a sad dried out sponge topped with cheap bread. If anyone has ventured into the dark world of microwaved cheeseburgers, this burger will take you back to that sad lonely place, seriously that is the first thing I thought of with my first bite. 

As for the chicken sandwich, the \"spicy\" added to the sandwich was actually just tangy buffalo sauce which wasn't anything to write home about to be sure. 

The reason I'm giving this place even 2 stars is because their onion rings and fries were both super delicious, how a place can go so right and so wrong all at the same time is beyond me. 
For now I'll just skip the 30 min trek to burger rush and stop by Smash burger or Burgerfi to satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"I called 2 times to make an order. The fist time they put me on hold right away and I waited 10 minutes with no one getting back on the line, so I figured they might have forgotten no biggie. Called the second time and again much like the first time I was told to hold but this time instead of being but on hold I was hung up on. Really disappointed since it seems that they have good food, but oh well me and my family will never know thanks to the horrible customer service skills at simply answering a phone."}
{"text":"I ordered from here today using GrubHub.  I'm a little guilty to say that I woke up this morning starving to death and found these guys open early and close enough to my work that GrubHub would work.  I ordered a kraut dog, chili cheese fries, a double cheeseburger with pickles, and fried broccoli...I did mention I was starving.  Obviously I wasn't able to eat all of it, but I sampled each item.  The fried broccoli was a bit of a let down.  It's as if the broccoli itself doesn't really cook and get soft like mushrooms and zucchini do.  The chipotle dipping sauce was good, if you like the taste of chipotle. The kraut dog was really good, it's very big and loaded with sauerkraut that you can tell they cooked on the griddle to heat it up.  The bun was very good too.  The double cheeseburger was HUGE.  It's a decent tasting burger.  The chili cheese fries were also huge, but I wasn't a big fan of the chili.  It's a bit too sweet for me when it comes to chili.  My lady ordered a small chili which she said she liked and interestingly enough she ordered the sourdough bacon burger melt.  She really liked that too, and i was impressed with it's size as well.

To be honest, I was a bit afraid to order from here, and even more ashamed to admit how much unhealthy food I ordered for myself, but at the end of the day, I have TONS of leftover food I can nibble on for dinner, and it's not half bad.

My delivery experience was mainly positive, they got the order right, delivered it right on time and everything was still hot.  My only complaint is that, for some odd reason, they just dropped it on our receptionist's front desk and left.  I had to wander into our lobby to discover it just kinda chilling there on her desk.

Just to note, I'm a bit confused about one of the recent one star reviews in which they specifically ordered no mushrooms and got mushrooms anyway.  Mushrooms aren't a standard topping, so there seems to be no need to ask for no mushrooms, unless they ordered a mushroom burger, but what kind of madman would order a mushroom burger with no mushrooms?  It will perplex me for some time to come."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here and I wasn't very pleased I had a classic cheese burger with fried zucchini the patty was more burnt then ever so that was hard eating alone then the Zucchinis were just flavor less I don't know why but I don't know if I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Went for carry-out. Today was my red meat day & I didn't want one of those regular fast food joint burgers. Lo & behold, Burger Rush - about a 5 minute drive from/to my house. 
Ordered cheeseburger, chili-cheese-onion fries, strawberry shake. 
Should've known something was wrong when it took almost 15 minutes to get my food. 
First the good: the chili-cheese fries with onion were really good. The chili doesn't taste like some can chili. Chunky meat, good spice, and even lumps of pepper. A little light on the cheese, but that was alright. The fries were crispy. The shredded onion added a nice extra to the overall taste. And they were the perfect temperature. 
The mediocre: the strawberry shake. Syrup overdose. Had some pieces of what I assume we're strawberries. Ok flavor, but it was basically whipped cream and some milk on top of a cup of strawberry syrup. 
The terrible: the cheeseburger. It was cold. Not warm. Not even room temperature. It's like they cooked & assembled the burger, then put it in the fridge. I'm on the verge of puking, just typing about it. Couldn't even tell if the flavor was good - it was THAT cold. Like the tomatoes tasted warmer than the meat. 
My theory is that they made the burger & shake, but then realized they forgot about the chili fries. Maybe they put the milkshake under a warmer & the burger in the freezer while making the chili fries - I don't know. But I'm now wishing I'd just gone to what-a-carl-donald's-king-n'out-smash-shack."}
{"text":"I like the food it's actually very good .. But  They always mess up the to-go orders for one... for 2 extremely slow don't go there if your in a hurry let me tell ya..."}
{"text":"Nice little burger spot, good food reasonably priced. They have a bunch of options for every taste. The onion rings are really good."}
{"text":"They literally served me breakfast with a live roach on top. Most disgusting thing I've ever seen. Got a 5 dollar coupon if anyone wants it."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout food for someone the other day. The counter ladies were very rude upon arrival. You could tell that all of them didn't want to be working. So I told them I was here to pick up an order (it was placed 20 minutes prior). They told me they just received the order. I waited, of course. I was very nice and patient about it, but they were acting like they were annoyed with me at this point. Finally the food came and the lady at the counter pretty much threw it at me when it was finished.
I'll never go back there."}
{"text":"I llike that this place is close to my work. They also deliver, which is nice. They have a breakfast menu as well. I have been here a few times. I really like the drink selection. This particular visit my boss went and picked up our food. Even though we ordered during \"happy hour\", my meal was almost $8 for burger, fries, and a drink which they advertise at $4.99 during HH. I wasn't there, though, so I'm not sure if happy hour excludes to go orders (not sure why it would, this is basically a glorified Wendy's, not a full service place). Maybe it was because I got a cheeseburger rather than a hamburger, but thats some awfully spendy cheese if that's the case. Or maybe it was just rung up wrong, which seems most likely to me. The food is pretty standard. It's nothing i would brag about or even go back for if it wasn't close. The other thing is that it takes a LONG time to get your order. Even when the place is empty. So, overall, you could do better, you could do worse."}
{"text":"The fries are excellent. The burgers are awful. Do you even season bro? BLAND AF"}
{"text":"Burger Rush recently opened it's second location in Phoenix on Central just south of Indian School. The atmosphere inside is trendy and they play upbeat pop music. There is plenty of indoor seating as this location was previously a McDonald's. They even have a nice covered outdoor seating area which is nice in the three seasons excluding summer. When you order they give you a number and bring out your order to your table which is nice. There is a self serve Coke drink station with 12 varieties of soda and Powerade, Hi-C.

The classic cheese burger is a 1/3 pound of juicy deliciousness! It has excellent flavor and isn't super greasy. Their meat is always fresh and never frozen unlike the fast food chains.  I will be coming back for another visit. I would definitely recommend trying this place out.

They also have .89 cent sliders which look delicious."}
{"text":"Headed out with my friend to get something good to eat but reasonably priced. She said let's try this new place and I am happy we did!

I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was really tasty. The bacon was nice and thick! We loved the onion rings, zucchini and chili cheese fries! All the portions are huge! 

They have a great beverage selection and their Oreo shake was to die for! 

There are so many things on the menu including some salads and sandwiches that I want to try. They have breakfast too! We're definitely going to try to come back during happy hour from 2 to 4 PM where you get a burger, fries and a Coke for $4.99.

I usually don't give five stars on my first visit but the price, food, atmosphere and service was great, so how could I not?

P. S. I love the little penguin!"}
{"text":"Very very good! This place will exceed your expectations. Large menu with plenty of variety to please anyone's likings. Portions are generous and the prices cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Burger Rush's food is really good. I especially love their fries. Probably my favorite fries. But their service is complete garbage. I've been in the drive-through to wait 15 minutes for a burger. I appreciate that it's made when I'm there, but there's no way that a fast food burger place should take 15 minutes. So I started to order a pick up since I live down the street. The last time I ordered, I was put on hold for more than 10 minutes, because whoever answered the phone was not capable of putting that order in for pick up? I've also had to wait a half an hour pick up a burger and fries. Seriously, the worst service of any place I've been to."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Really awesome breakfast burritos good service and and fast delivery. Wish the burritos were bigger especially for the price but the tortillas are authentic and the eggs are cracked not from a bag. 

Go here after 3pm and get a burger for $.50  they also have one of those coke machines that gives you a ton of flavor options."}
{"text":"Super disappointing and awkward service. 

I stood by myself at the register for several minutes before someone stopped what they were doing and came to ask if I needed help or wanted to order.  

I ordered a regular cheese burger, fries, and milkshake. There was confusion about how the order went and if I could get a milkshake and fries....really? I told the cashier to ring them in individually if needed, he got some help and got it sorted out. The burger came out and the bun was freezing cold (like just out of the refrigerator) and the burger itself wasn't that warm.

Its very standard burgers in the high rent district, so save yourself the extra cost and go to a cheaper burger place for the same quality and service."}
{"text":"The service we receive from Burger Rush is always A+++. Jamie is always very friendly & goes the extra mile with ALL the customers to make sure their dining/takeout experiences are the best! Thank You Jamie & other employees for always being nice! Your efforts are truly appreciated!"}
{"text":"Great menu.  Great quality and serving sizes.  Great prices. Way more than burgers.  Also a good breakfast menu, sandwiches, Mediterranean food, Pitas, wraps, etc and some Vegan items.  Been there about 6 times now, making it one of my regular lunch places."}
{"text":"I work in the hospitality industry and rarely ever complain about anything that may go wrong during my time at or with another establishment in the business, since it is just food after all. However, what happened tonight is absolutely unacceptable. 

So, I ordered through the eat24 app and the delivery guy showed up in a reasonable amount of time, so everything seemed like it was just going to be your run-of-the-mill delivery service. NOPE! I ordered nachos, a cheeseburger combo with fries and a 32oz soda, an Oreo milkshake, and a side of blue cheese dressing. The guy hands me the milkshake and I couldn't remember the total, so I asked him and he responds with \"I don't remember, I didn't bring the receipt. I also don't have my phone on me, so you can call if you'd like.\" Uh, whatever guy, I'll just look it up on my email. The total was $23.36, so I gave him $29 and told him to keep the rest for a tip. Then he gives me my food and says that he \"forgot my soda\" and that he'll \"go back and get it for me\" and \"throw in an additional soda for the inconvenience\". Me being the rational person I am agrees to that and I'm still not upset at this point. I only live 3 minutes from this place, so it didn't seem like a big deal for him to have to drive back there and then back here, and I tipped over 20% on top of that. Then I go to check the bag and there is no straw for my milkshake and the blue cheese dressing is nowhere to be found, so my boyfriend called the store and a woman answered and assured him that the dressing would be coming with the drinks. We wait for 30 minutes and nothing has shown up yet, so we call again. Woman assures my boyfriend that the delivery guy is coming back. We wait another 45 minutes and still, nothing. Try to call again and nobody answers. 

So, basically they stole like $5 from me and also, my food was cold when it arrived. Awesome, thanks a lot for the superior customer service. I won't go without a fight, Burger Rush, you will be delivering my soda to me at some point in time. Or else I will make it my life's work to destroy your reputation, not that you would actually need help in that. Your employees are doing a great job already."}
{"text":"When they first opened they were awesome! But it seems they are quickly going down hill. The drive through takes forever, things are never made the same way every time, food has upset my stomach and caused me to vomit. Perhaps food poisening? Last time I called in an order ahead of time and arrived  at the restuarant and still waited 34 mins for my order. What happened to the quality? I use to dine here 2-3 times a week. Food orders most the time are not right. Very inconsistant here with the exception of the soda pop. Its always good ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint...EVER!  Diverse menu includes many burgers, wraps, salads...Etc.  my favorite is the Ortega burger with turkey patty.  Huge and sloppy.  Generous portion of green chili."}
{"text":"Best burger place I've eaten in awhile good prices Oliver you have great customer service I will definitely be coming back definitely 5 stars Oliver you are the best waitress I've had in a long time"}
{"text":"I used UberEats. It took longer than estimated, but that was ok. First, My burger was delicious: juicy and with a lot extra pickles, as requested. Great burger. I requested cheddar cheese in the UberEats app and-- strangely--got a slab of cheddar between the burgers, and  American cheese on top. I don't like American cheese, but the burger was still good. The french fries were not good. They arrived as a big, soggy blob in a paper envelope. [side note: The last time I ordered fries through UberEats, from another place, those were soggy too. There's a lesson there, but what is it?: All french fries can't travel by car? SOME places' fries can't travel? Or, some places just make soggy fries?]"}
{"text":"Great charbroiled burgers!! Chicken wraps are amazing and good portion size. Great service too!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the place is clean but the owner abuses his employees and humiliates them in front of everyone. I felt really bad watching some villain stuck in the 80s with a jersey shore beard scream for a burger to his very embarrassed and nervous employee. He never let up and I didn't even realize he was the owner until he said \"if I was back there I would've had this s**t made already\"."}
{"text":"In a nutshell.  Burger Rush is awesome.  Decent priced, quality food.  Their homemade ranch is the best I've ever had. Their Fried zucchini and fried broccoli are both top notch. 100% beef. 1 burger will fill you up.  They offer wheat buns.  They serve very good omelets, especially the mushroom. Quick & accurate delivery.  Very friendly staff and clean environment. I recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Refurbished McDonalds building. Pretty yummy food so far. Burger with a sack of fresh cut fries. Sliders are what Mickey D hamburgers should taste like. The fried Zukes are da bomb!  Try it!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this restaurant completely by accident... It has become my favorite burger joint! From the moment you walk in, you are greeted with a smile and the staff will happily provide a suggestion when asked. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are delicious. Just might have found my new breakfast spot. Had the steak, egg, cheese, home fries, salsa and pico de gallo the first time and had the three meat combo second time. Definitely need to try this place out of you haven't. Also very clean establishment. Always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"The quantity is extremely good for the price. I ordered the mushroom burger, and a small side of onions rings, and that small basket in which it came in was heavily loaded, and almost overloaded. No complaint there in the prices. 
I am a burger fanatic, and was looking forward to checking the place out. I went on a Thursday morning (5/22- ~9am). There wasn't much action when I got there, there was a lady waiting for a to-go, and one seated. I took my time to check the menu out completely, and could not avoid hearing one of the employees complaining about a customer who had been there earlier. Wow, but none of my business. Once I ordered  I headed over to the bathrooms, only to find it filthy. There was toilet paper scattered on the floor, dried up pee stains, and sink covered in random hairs. Never had I been so glad I had hand sanitizer, and I got out of that pigsty. I went over to sit down, and soon after noticed that the women seated near me had received her order wrong twice before, and she seemed happy that the third time was a charm. Yay. My food didn't take too long to come out, and it came out pretty warm, and fresh. The burger lacked flavor, if I hadn't seen it for myself I would have never guessed it had any mushrooms, but the rings were freakin' fantastic. About halfway my meal I decided I'd get some ketchup from the dispensers near me, and was shocked to find that they were all empty, I sat right back down with great disappointment. But the icing on the cake was when half way my burger I pull out this wonderfully long, blonde hair out of the burger.  . .that is where I had to call it quits. It was just one thing after another. . .
My overall experience at this place was just awful. I had been very excited to visit the location, and see what it was all about, but this visit pretty much killed it for me. I don't plan on returning, not unless it improves it's ways, and becomes a life or death situations."}
{"text":"Is there a new owner of BR? I met JR, the owner when it opened but have not seen him since. the quality of this place has definitely changed. The ketchup tastes cheap, the push button soda machine is gone, the burger patties are smaller. it's a shame, I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great variety. Burgers were fresh and the gyro was great. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Used Eat24 for delivery and the food was fantastic and delivery was fast. Husband had the classic double and it was the size of his head. And he ate the whole thing because it was so good. Along with a small order of chili fries, which were so large we had left overs. Which were just as good the next day. I had the gyro wrap and some fried zucchini - and can't wait to order them again."}
{"text":"Love this burger place in my neck o' the woods (central Phoenix). The place has an old-fashioned burger joint look and feel, it's very clean, there's lots of parking especially at the back, and the staff is very friendly. I tried their bacon avocado cheeseburger combo - it was awesome. The burger had a grilled flavor which I like; and the fries which came as part of the combo had a good regular thickness (thank goodness they did not follow that trend toward shoestring fries) and were not overcooked so they had a crispy exterior but tender interior. The prices are good and the food portions are generous. They have WiFi too, which makes it a pleasure to linger a bit."}
{"text":"Stopped by this evening for the first time with the family and it was great!
Great yumny food! Friendly and helpful staff! Huge portions!
The shakes are thick and creamy, not runny like other fast food!
Ordered the bacon cheeseburger and it was tasty, yet juicy!
This food reminded us of a non fast food joint!
Best part was it was cheap for our family of four, we left full with plenty of left overs!
We will be back! Thank you
Cannot wait to try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive through..... This place is usually empty or close to it every time I pass. I always wondered if it was any good. Well it was Great! I ordered the Ortega Burger and it was Awesome. It wasn't overly expensive. You get what you pay for. The burger was big and put together well. It was covered in huge grilled peppers and was cooked to perfection. I do recommend this burger joint!"}
{"text":"Stop closing early when you claim to be open.. Its uncool when a man needs late night quality grub and can't get it. Just saying."}
{"text":"A really decent greasy burger joint. Decent burger size. I really liked the burger with an egg on it. Onion rings and fries were bland but they aren't the main feature. Kind of weird menu but it's interesting to see them serve spaghetti. Very low key at 12/18 around 7pm. Pretty quick service!"}
{"text":"They do breakfast and burgers fairly decent for a fast food place. I never am disappointed when I come here. Make sure you call in your order. They make everything fresh so it takes a bit longer"}
{"text":"Easily the most disgusting burger I've ever eaten a bite of. It tasted like when you're cooking over a campfire and accidentally drop something in the ash covered coals. Not flame broiled or whatever you may want to imagine... No, it tastes like straight ashy unwashed dirt. I truly wish I could get the taste out of my mouth right now. 
So freaking gross."}
{"text":"A very good mesquite burger. The fries are lightly coated, hot and fresh. Service was prompt and friendly. We would definitely come back.  The restaurant was clean with severa condiments available at the table. 

Side note: there was a young man in the restaurant who was not a customer but seemed like he may have been on something? The (I presume) manager came out  and handled it very professionally. He was polite and kind, inquiring how the young man was doing. He didn't kick him out but said to let him know if he needed anything. The guy left soon after."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, fries are delicious but need ketchup which I'm fine with.  They also have the new flavored coca cola machines with vanilla sprite, gods true gift to humanity.

Recommend the Ghost Pepper Burger or the BBQ Chicken Salad.

The reason they only get 4 stars though is that they have messed up my order numerous times or not even started an item by the time i get there for pickup.  Service has gotten much better since they first opened, but still have the occasional order errors."}
{"text":"Screw this place. The building itself looks like a run down crap hole. Inside is even worse. I ordered the pastrami Rueben and a day later, I'm peeling over, in the bathroom, fluids coming out from both ends. I know when I have been poisoned. They definitely CROSS CONTAMINATED my food. DO NOT GO HERE!!! I HAVE CALLED THE HEALH INSPECTOR ON THE PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and comes quickly when I order. We ordered dinner today and checked that we wanted mustard packets in the condiments section. When I answered the door, the driver told me they were out at the restaurant so he stopped at Quiktrip and got some for us! How awesome is that?!"}
{"text":"depending on who is cooking that day you can order the same thing and it will be cooked differently.  that is my only complaint.  other than that the food is above average .  best bacon cheese burger in the area for the money .  try the deep fried zucchini but make sure they cook it thoroughly. it can be amazing.  breakfast is slow but cheep and good."}
{"text":"Excellent service thanks to the server Allen. Very much appreciated for a home delivery. Very impressed. Thank you very much and keep doing what you guys keep doing. Great food also."}
{"text":"The Fries are good. The burger taste like burger king with thousand island dressing. It's not bad but I have had better"}
{"text":"I came in the other night and there is a girl I don't see every often and she made me feel unwelcome with her attitude. She was gossiping about things that are inappropriate for work before srrving me. She also kept bringing up that she was pregnant as punctuation to any insulting remarks made.
But I really love the food here. customer service is great generally. I recommend the cowboy burger to start out with. Their soda machine has many options which is nice. Its only a 4 stars because the employee brought down the experience I have had before."}
{"text":"Agree with other yelpers here that their delivery service is horrible. They should not deliver. We ordered thru Grubhub and the first part of the delivery came within 45 mins but had to call back because we were missing a sandwich. We had to argue that we had actually ordered from Grubhub correctly. They called us back and said oh it was their fault and they'd send us our sandwich right away. 2 more calls and a total of 3 hrs after our original order we get the last sandwich!!!
Food rating: 3- burger, fries, and milkshake were just so so."}
{"text":"The worst delivery service EVER.  Waited almost 2 hours - countless phone calls to Grub Hub tellling us food was \"almost there.\"  Food was delivered more than one hour after the estimated delivery time.  No apology from the delivery driver who had received a nice tip.  Food was ice cold.  Everything that was to be served hot was inedible.  The diet coke was so watered down from the melted ice we threw it away.  Complete lack of concern for customer service.  Burger Rush was definitely not in any rush to deliver us a decent dinner."}
{"text":"Got food delivered to a hotel- arrived exactly when estimated.  Food got mixed up with someone else's so I ended up having a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and chocolate milkshake. Delicious and generous portions."}
{"text":"My husband and I order from this location frequently. They're always ahead of schedule and polite. I'm addicted to the veggie burrito  
They strike a great balance between Quality food, great customer service and fast delivery."}
{"text":"Vary rude manager Johnny yell back at me. I call get a refund because my order was not right. Ask for name of owner female first refused to give name then give phone to Johnny. Still have not received a refund. Never going back."}
{"text":"Changed times of operation, drove there to find it not open, call a head so you don't end up like us."}
{"text":"I'm a Tempe native of 53 years so I've seen things come and go. I happened to be delivering Uber for fun and I kept getting called to this place. It smelled so good. I finally decided to try it and it was amazing. I had a single that was huge. I have no idea why you would need a double. For $10.00, including tax, you get a great burger, a huge amount of fries and a drink. Yes, it's more than fast food but then again you're eating quality. This rates up with Chuckbox or even better. I can't believe I wrote that. They also have a big menu including breakfast stuff. Totally impressed"}
{"text":"My first time here and I instantly fell in love after the first bite of my burger. You can taste the freshness. I will absolutely be back. Inside decor is nice, warm, welcoming. Staff very friendly. I very much enjoyed my impromptu stop for lunch at Burger Rush today."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. They take forever to get your order ready specially the drive through window."}
{"text":"Great service and the burgers are very tasty.  Hours are convenient. Try lettuce burger wrap! !"}
{"text":"I got the turkey burger with avocado and onion rings. Not bad! Hard to find a good turkey burger at a fast food place."}
{"text":"This was horrible!!!! Waited 25 minutes in the drive through. We ordered onion rings and got fries. I got a carne asada burrito (special on the sign). It was the worst I've ever had. It had more bell peppers than meat and the tortilla was hard and stale, and the best part.... Hot lettuce inside! Couldn't eat it. My wife got the turkey burger and it was sooo gross. I think they used the ground turkey that comes in a tube. Avoid at all costs. 
Now I'm off to Jack in the Box to pick up dinner. I can't believe that I spent $25 at this place."}
{"text":"I'm pretty upset that the menu on yelp is wrong. I ordered the colossal burger and it says it comes with chips but it didn't. I didn't realise it had onions on it either, but I get that was my bad. When I called to tell them what happened the girl said it wasn't her problem and that they've been telling yelp that the menu is wrong. How is this my fault? She was very Very rude and kept saying I was yelling at her, but I was only trying to get her to understand my disappointment.... So lame..

OK so the review above is when I was helped by one of the managers, maybe she was having a bad day, or maybe she needs a lesson in customer service. I talked to the store manager today and he handled the situation perfectly! I do love the burgers and shakes here so I'm glad he was able to help me and make me feel better about everything. I will definitely recommend this to friends and I will continue to order."}
{"text":"Decent burgers. Unfortunately the drive-through worker can barely speak good enough English to take in order. It also takes quite a long time to prepare the burgers, so if you are in a rush this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times, 2 happy hour visits and one dinner visit. Every single time the food has been served very fresh! The burgers do not taste like processed McDonald's, they taste homemade. The French fries are my favorite, some are soft and some are extra crunchy. They are so good dipped in their ranch, which is sinfully delicious! I want to try so much more from them. My only complaint was that we told them everything on one kids burger and one plain and we got them both plain. But it wasn't a huge deal."}
{"text":"I ordered burger rush through Uber eats. 20 minutes later   I get a call from one of their employees who then tells me they are out of their chili and asked if I would like to substitute anything else in its place. I asked isn't the chili the main ingredient in your nachos? The answer was yes so because I already placed the order I told the representative to let me look at the menu real quick and I will pick something else. The rep responded with; okay do you want to call us back.... at this point I already assumed that customer service isn't in burger rushes training manual if even in their vocabulary. I just told him yes. 2 minutes later I call back to order a avocado bacon cheese burger I reach the same rep and he advised me to hold on so he could get his manager to make the change. The manager picks up the phone and says so you would like to get the abc burger instead of the nachos? I responded no, but because you guys are out of chili, the burger would be my next best option and even though the burger and nachos are the same price I was advised that it would be an additional $2 and if I didn't want to pay it I was told to cancel my order. Now keep in mind this is 30 minutes after I placed my order that I am dealing with this. At that point I asked to speak with the manager and I was told \"I am the manager\". I said I'm not paying a price difference for this order your menu pricing is the same. His response was \"I don't like the way you're  speaking to me you're very rude and I'm very tired.\" I said excuse me what's your name and he said cancel the order and hung up on me. What a poor excuse for leadership in a place of business. As a business owner if that was my establishment there would be some strong influence on how to service your customers properly. What a bad example this \"manager\" set for his employees. Welcome to the service industry kid I hope you read this and you're better off finding a job at a car wash if you don't like the way dissatisfied customers talk to you. This was my first and last experience with that place. Hopefully the owner will step up and set some things straight. That was the worst experience that I can ever recall having with a restaurant in my life."}
{"text":"Yummy! :)

Ordered a double cheeseburger... totally shouldn't have. This thing is the size of my head! 

The fries were tasty. Some of them were crunchy and then a few of those mushy treasures! I haven't eaten the ceasar salad yet but the lettuce looks fresh, not wilty. Will order again. Wish the boyfriend was home to finish this burger for me.."}
{"text":"The patty could be better quality but the overall burger is okay. The service was great we had a friendly cashier/server."}
{"text":"I have gave this place two chances. First time ordered a Patty Melt, which was not on Rye bread and had American Cheese....INCORRECT! Second time I ordered Chiki Dogs, they were horrible, I couldn't even finish them."}
{"text":"Service was great, Chilli Fries got them the 3 stars, but the burger was....EH....

The price is good and it is \"Fast Food\" so I would eat here in a pinch, but this is not my preferred Burger Joint!"}
{"text":"I simply cannot understand how this place has such good reviews. Although my burger patty itself was good, everything else tasted cheap. The lettuce was terrible, as was the bun and the tomatoes. Is it necessary to put 1000 Island dressing on every single burger? As a whole, everything reminded me of McDonald's, except the burger was a lot bigger. The onion rings were soggy and the breading kept falling off of the fried zucchini. Very disappointed. One star for the burger patty, fries, and speedy delivery. I won't be eating from here again."}
{"text":"Just another burger place. The menu is very creative and sound really good but the burgers themselves are just mediocre. I enjoys the fried zucchini more than anything. Friendly staff with great attitudes. OK burger joint but not my first choice by far."}
{"text":"Closed during posted hours.  Will not be back. Consistency is the key to success. This place will be closed by August."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Elks RV park. Burger rush is just around the corner. It is clean and the service was prompt. My breakfast burrito was great!"}
{"text":"**Unreal**. I ordered delivery from Burger Rush and under the special instructions I clearly wrote exactly what I wanted on my burger due to the fact that I am allergic to tomatoes. The delivery was very fast, tthe delivery driver was great and I tipped him $10 on a $12 tab to show my gratitude for the great service. Once I walked inside and unwrapped my burger I realized they had completely disregarded my request for toppings and included tomatoes, which I am very allergic to. When I gave them a call I asked if they could see the special instructions on a Yelp order and the gentleman on the phone said he saw the instructions which made me more frustrated. He then offered to bring another burger, but I was unable to take him up on that because I didn't have time to wait for another meal. He then offered me a refund, but was extremely rude when he told me he would have to send a driver with my cash refund. Despite the terrible attitude he said he would send the driver with my refund. ***hours went by and closing time came around and still no driver with my refund*** I am absolutely blown away that they would be rude to me for calling to let them know they put an ingredient on my burger that would trigger a very serious reaction and then blatantly lie to me about bringing a refund. I am at a loss for words at how I was treated when this could have been such a dangerous situation just to be lied to! I can't say I'll ever order from here again. Complete trash. (Again, the driver was amazing and exceeded my expectations. The shake was also great)"}
{"text":"I ordered from here on the random and was super surprised at what I got! Large, delicous burger and the best french fries I've ever had!! Will definitely be coming back and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The burgers and fries are always fresh. Very clean and well up kept facility. This place has amazing burgers. The portions are great and so is the service."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever food is awful and the little white dude at the register was rude as fuck"}
{"text":"Wow, fast delivery! Ordered the Ortega burger and a dinner salad. Delivery took less than 30 minutes. Food was exactly what I ordered. The salad was huge, no way I could eat all of that in one meal.  The burger was good, I enjoyed the peppers, but the meat could ave used some seasoning or spice.  Overall, a satisfying meal. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"Knocks out all burger/hot dog places in the 20 mile radius!!!
Lenny's got beat...but not by much."}
{"text":"I love the fries and onion rings here! Guilty pleasures. I have been 3x now in the past 2 months. My first time, the staff was really friendly and fun. We talked about cows and petting zoo types of farms. Additional times, staff have been friendly/courteous. 

I just have to be careful that I get exactly what I order, as I try to get a grilled cheese with cheddar (not American cheese) but wit the veg that comes with the burger and this isn't always what's in my bag. So double check your order before you leave the restaurant if you customize something!

Also the restaurant does have an odd smell. I can't quite place it, definitely musty, but don't let that deter you from ordering great food!"}
{"text":"For fast food burger joints, this place is as good as it gets. I would pick this over In N' Out, McDonalds, or any other burger establishment in a heartbeat. Why do you ask? Well these are the types of burgers where you order it, and they legitimately make it when you order it (not the \"Oh yeah, let me throw this in a microwave\"). I get the Ghost Pepper Burger and the Egg and Bacon burger as standard fare. My wife loves their Mushroom burger. The ingredients seem fresh, the workers are courteous and nice. It takes time to cook your food, so it will take longer than most fast food establishments, but its well worth the wait and you can taste the quality every time. This place really surprised me, and in a very good way. Try it out and you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food place in the area. They have delicious fries and onion rings and great customer service. Even the salad is good!
After getting home and realizing they had forgotten to put my order of fries in the bag during my last visit, we went back. When we went in, the manager not only gave us one order of fries, but two or three. He also refilled our order of onion rings and offered us free drinks! It's high quality fast food, and this kind of customer service is what will keep us coming back for a long time. Thank you, Burger Rush!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Used the Eat24 to order online for delivery, took over an hour. Fries soggy and barely warm, should have considered that when ordering for delivery I guess. Ordered a Caesar salad, paid for ranch, did not get Caesar dressing or the ranch. Guess I will be eating cold fries and a dry salad. Yum."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru, nice setup from outside. I ordered the fried egg bacon burger meal, and added small order of fried zucchini. First thing everything was overpriced for what I got paid $13 and some change. The burger itself had little to no seasoning, the lettuce seemed like it was sitting all day in the heat, the fried zucchini was okay but little flavor, fries were good needed some salt. The staff was pretty friendly but I waited 10 min at the drive up window to get my food, if there was another car behind me they would of probably had a bit#% fit. Slow burger would be a better name fit."}
{"text":"Several months ago, I had visited Burger Rush when I was in a hurry and needed to eat something. I didn't really pay any attention to it, nor pay attention to whether the burger I got was any good or not. It didn't create a lasting impression. 

I don't know if something changed in the meantime, but a week ago, I went back. Ordered a double cheeseburger, thinking that I was getting something along the range of Five Guys. I was wrong. Pleasantly so. This burger, which was (roughly) the same price as Five Guys was much larger and much more flavorful. 

I went back again this week, and was happy to discover they do their bugerss bun-less (as a lettuce wrap). Once again, I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size, the construction, and flavor of my meal. 

Recently, as I've been eating Paleo, I've been going to Red Robin a lot. It's a little pricey after tip. Instead, I'll be heading to Burger Rush at least once every couple weeks. It's truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Got the cowboy burger. The sauce isn't bad but is more on the sour side than sweet. The menu on yelp said it had onion rings on it, but they are onion straws and some still had the skin on them which was not good and I had to pick them out.... French fries and banana malt were decent!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  1st time I had the small order of onion rings / zucchini. Very tasty!!! I went back on 04/11 n ordered patty melt n a large order of zucchini.   
Now the patty melt was very good. But the large zucchini was the same size as a small but for more. Interesting?  I will question it when I return again for something else on the menu and if I pair it again with zucchini."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering take out from here. It is a ways from where I live which is why it was no biggie that the fries were slightly cold. The milkshake was soo good! The only problem I had was the burger was just not up to par. Despite that, it was ok."}
{"text":"I was honestly shocked with how good the quality and taste of the food was. The outside appearance wasn't much but I had the gyro and my boyfriend has the avocado bacon burger and both were amazing and cheap. The owner was also a joy to speak with."}
{"text":"Great place! Service is always friendly, the prices are good and the menu is awesome! They've taken this place from being a vacant McDonald's to something like a funky fast food restaurant/eatery-blend. Try them out, you'll be glad you did! They also have breakfast which I plan to try soon."}
{"text":"OK

It took them awhile to get into their groove, but great googley moogley these burgers are BOMB!

I get the double cheese burger, lettuce wrapped.. and oh man it is so good. I can't comment about the fries as i havent tried them in a year or so.

But i highly recommend this place.. and if you are local, they deliver!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly decent place.  Music is good, restaurant is clean.  The food. I have the cowboy burger. Fried onions, bacon, bbq, pickles on a burger.  This would be good if the burger was not so over cooked.  Flavor is good, but with the large toasted bun and the over cooked burger(no temperature asked) it is very dry."}
{"text":"The burgers are good just don't FORGET to add cheese if you like cheese since the burgers do not come with it. I recommend the cowboy burger! Super yummy!!! 

I would AVOID going during lunch hours, the  word RUSH goes out of the window at lunch time & SLOW replace it. Took 15mins just for an order of zucchini. 

They also NO LONGER carry sweet potato tater tots :-( 

Overall waaaaayyyy better than your typical McDonald's burger at a good price!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came in here for lunch on the week it opened and we were all so happy to add this place to our lunch routine.   Our burgers were fresh and juicy patties and the fries were hot and seasoned perfectly.  Unfortunately, that was the last time we had a good experience.  On multiple occasions, we've been served fries that were so over seasoned that we had to spit them out.  Burgers are carelessly thrown together and falling apart. That freshness we once tasted was replaced with old wilted lettuce and cold meat grease.  Like crackheads, we were chasing that first experience but we just ended up throwing money at food too gross to swallow.  It's a great menu but really poor execution."}
{"text":"you get what you pay for that is about par for the course something is missing from this place....the great atmosphere is gone and seems to be a shell of what it once was...breakfast is still good but its hit or miss at night staff doesnt seem to have uniforms seems like ppl are working around the house more than actually working"}
{"text":"Why isn't this place ranked higher?? I had the BBQ chicken wrap with French fries and a side of ranch for lunch and I don't have a single thing to complain about. BBQ chicken wrap was delightful and had crispy straws in it, grilled chicken that didn't taste processed, and a nice mix of lettuce tomato and sauces. The French fries were crispy and warm and the ranch isn't some Hidden Valley junk and they give you a big serving of it! It's a lot of food and I am full as heck for about $11.00 plus a little tip for their speedy service. Loveeeee this place and my coworker went right after me to pick up the same thing."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this out for some time. Maybe I expected too much. It was good but not great. Not as good as some of the other area burger joints in Tempe. 

Worst part was the owner kept staring at us. I couldn't tell if he thought we were a threat (business people in business suits) or if he was looking at me with bedroom eyes. Either way it was super creepy. I also got the feeling that the employees weren't too fond of him either."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, and I have eaten at Burger Rush 4 or 5 times. Last night, they earned my 5 star review. First off, you can tell how much they all love their job! Everyone is so friendly, and the burgers and fare are that old time wholesome burger type that I crave from my childhood. I am a busy restaurant guy myself, and I get off late. I had to run to the back across the street last night. I was starving, and I saw the OPEN sign on. I literally got to the drive thru with minutes before close. I ordered a single fried fish sandwich! They cheerfully made it fresh and it was delicious. I was grateful and satiated, and made to feel like they were happy to make it for me. They will always get my business. In a sea of burger chains, Burger Rush stands out as a class operation."}
{"text":"The fried zucchini is awesome!!!! And a new favorite is the Fried Broccoli yes fried Broccoli never had it before here. Burgers are good not great but good. We really come for the Zucchini."}
{"text":"Was looking for a different kind of delivery because I was sick of chinese food. Was so happy that I came across burger rush. I conveniently ordered through Grub Hub and paid less than $6 for a burger. Food arrived under 45 minutes and was delicious. Can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"Hungry in Saturday night, saw this new place on Yelp so I decided to drive out and try it out. 

Get there and it looked closed? Website says open 7 days till midnight and it isn't even 11?

I go up to the door and it's locked. Go through the drive through and no one is there. Finally someone comes over and says they closed at ten. I told them to change their website. 

Bullshit."}
{"text":"The food is pretty spot on. Love the ghost pepper burger and the milk shakes are great. However, the delivery is a huge miss. Drivers are complete a** holes. Literally won't get out of their car or speak a word to you. Service is so bad it's laughable."}
{"text":"I always get the mini rush sliders and they are the best!
They also have super cheap burgers after 3pm if you aren't alone. Like a BOGO deal."}
{"text":"went to burger rush oh a whim. walking in the staff was friendly, and they there busy cleaning. since it was the first time being in there I asked them to advise me what to get, and ended up getting the ghost pepper burger meal. the burger and fries were delicious, I will definitely be going back for future visits"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place isn't busier every time I come here. The burgers are great, not much more that the cheap fast food joints, and WAY better food. If you haven't had it, you've gotta try it."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fast food burger and fries you'll find, at least in Tempe. They are a step up from Burger King and McDonald's but I don't like the \"sauce\" they add to their burgers. I'd skip unless you're into that kinda thing. A decent meal when you're too hungover or lazy to cook at home."}
{"text":"A very nice burger place,great good, priced right and good portions 
Staff are very friendly, I felt that definitely got my money's worth
I would give them 5 stars but since it's a new place they have to strive for improvements
Overall they've earned my business"}
{"text":"What can one say....they have really good burgers and fried zucchini! They also have this great special where you buy a burger and get any classic for 49 Cents. You ask me, can't get better than that!

On top of good food, the server was very friendly. Heck, even the cook smiled at me. Definitely felt welcomed there and will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The manager is always great to talk to and the food is excellent. Did I mention they deliver? They have everything here to from breakfast burritos to delicious cheeseburgers. This place is my go to for the munchies."}
{"text":"Ordered over Ubereats was impressed by the flavor! Got the ghost pepper burger and it was super hot, just as expected! Fries were not bad, overall good burgers. Have picked up deliveries for Ubereats and had very good customer service. Guy at the register was joking around with me and making me laugh, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  We had the avocado bacon burger and the pastrami sandwich.  The burger was great, fresh and cooked perfectly! The pastrami was spicy, peppery and delicious. We chose fried zuchini and cheese fries with bacon.  Everything was super fresh and obviously cooked to order.  I can't say enough about the food and the service was fantastic as well.  Run, don't walk to Burger Rush!!!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place, but the food just isn't doing it for me. Undercooked, soggy fries and an underwhelming burger made up my disappointing lunch today (ordered the Jr Deluxe, ended up with a Double Deluxe- not sure if that was due to the horrible static over the drive thru intercom). Patties were cooked nicely (not overdone), but the burger managed to get soggy on one side while the cheese stayed hard and cold on the other in the 10 minute drive back to the office. Definitely want to try this place again in a few weeks, when hopefully all the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger combo. I was about on par with what you can get at Burger King. It's a pretty basic, frozen pattie, cheeseburger. And it was over cooked.

If you're looking for a big juicy burger made from real beef patties this is not the place. 

Service was great."}
{"text":"Hidden burger joint. We were skeptical of their buy one burger get one for 49 cents, but it was great! Their burgers are delicious and their french fries are AMAZING! They batter dip them so they are extra crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Employees are nice and the restaurant is always clean when we go. We have been back several times since our first visit and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Had the bacon cheeseburger ! If you like the chargrilled taste like myself then you will love their burgers . Everything was fresh and the burger was filling . The fries reminded me of what corleons has but they have a hint of spicy. Regardless this place is great. 4 stars dues to the price..."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and delivery too. What more could you want. The classic burgers I ordered were hot and tasty and delivery right on time to a hotel. Great food, good prices make this place a winner."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is decent but I came here to the drive thru twice and twice they screwed up my order the first time I said cheddar cheese and grilled onions only repeated it twice and when I got my burger all the way back to work which was my mistake not checking before I left it was fully loaded with toppings and thousand island I think? The second time I came here they put American instead of cheddar and I can't eat American cheese which wouldn't have been a big deal but the man at the drive thru then argued with me and said it wasn't so I just left the drive thru takes forever and with all the other options out there for burgers these days I don't need to spend $8 and have a wrong order and 20 mins of my life gone sorry I really wanted this place to be something I shared with friends and coworkers but I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Wow. These guys make some amazing burgers here. 

It's a fast food style service but the food is was higher quality. You can take they take their time with the ingredients and flavors. Made to order and was fresh when I bit into their basic burger. 

I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This goes to the fact that over the course of a year this place has been going down hill.  In the past,  there has been items missing from orders and yet they never do anything about it.  

Ordering online is a complete joke with Burger Rush. Food that is over 30 minutes late is still not here and on top of that,  will most likely be cold and soggy like usual. This will be the last time I order from them. Way to many issues."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! I keep coming back for the steak and avocado salad!! So good!"}
{"text":"I got here around 4:45 and I was the only customer. I ordered a cheese burger combo and a side of thousand island, it came out to about $9. It was $8 and change, im not exactly sure of the price cause the girl at the register threw away my receipt and didn't offer it  to me. The cheese burger wasn't bad. It's the same burger you can get frome the burger shoppe, nothing special. The reason for the 2 stars was definitely for the food. I figured since I was the only one there the food should be nice and warm. The burger was fresh but the fries were cold. Not even warm! There is no way they made those for me. It was definitely not worth the price. I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEats. Sourdough bacon burger was amazing with thick cut bacon that was nice and crispy. Delivery was fast and arrived hot. My only regret was not ordering a shake."}
{"text":"Good food but so overpriced literally got an order of fries and 2 ranches payed almost 7 dollars!! Service sucks they get pretty much every order wrong we've had to go back almost every time pretty annoying."}
{"text":"I love fried zucchini. Unfortunately, burger rush must be in too much of a rush to actually fry theirs. I tried to give them a second chance and even requested they fry it longer, with the same result. it would probably be outstanding if they knew how to cook it. Guy at drive thru with classy finger tattoos is extremely rude and forgot my ranch twice. Really? and order of 2 items is too much for you to handle?  also, I don't like my food thrown at me and the window slammed so I have no chance to ask for something if its not right. I would seriously suggest you hold a hiring event for new fry cooks and window service. one star for proximity and the second because at least I got zucchini."}
{"text":"New place where the McDonald's on Central used to be located.  When they first opened a few months ago I would have given this place 5 stars, however, as time has progressed their attention to detail has slipped. A drive thru, but not technically fast food, a wait is to be expected. I have not eaten inside so can not rate that. The steak and avocado salad is fantastic but i have had issues lately with forgotten avocado and tough steak slices. All in all good variety with decent prices."}
{"text":"Just got breakfast here and it was really delicious! Ive always passed by this place and finally decided to stop by. I got the breakfast special, which is toast, 2 eggs, hash browns, and bacon for just over $4. Great deal, great food, and say service. I will be back for breakfast and to try their lunch items."}
{"text":"We just ordered delivery.  It arrived in less than an hour which is pretty good especially since we live 15 min away. The burger and fries were delicious. We love thick cut fries. The chili was REALLY spicy however overall no other complaints.  We'll skip the chili next time. 

Will for sure order from here again. The prices are really reasonable and we love the delivery option."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and pretty good milkshakes ! I love the Ortega burger and the buffalo chicken wrap. The fries inconsistent , sometimes they're crisp other times they aren't. Another plus is that they are also featured on grub hub and therefore deliver. No complaints from me :)"}
{"text":"Looks better than it taste.  But I don't recommend it. The meat is bland, but the fries taste original"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I've tried them twice now and both times was an utter disappointment. The hamburger is a frozen tasteless patty. The burger is dry. The staff is friendly but that's about all this place has going for it. if your thinking about going here I would advise against it. Not worth the waste of money and added calories."}
{"text":"These guys can't seem to get their shit together. Drive through is slowest ever. Waiting inside is better, then you just have to wait for the food, which I think is pretty good and is cooked on site.

They are an example of why minimum wage should be raised  The employees here could give a shit, and why should they?

I was going to get a breakfast sandwich, but they have lettuce and tomato on them? That makes no sense, and makes me think that whoever put the menu together hasn't had a breakfast sandwich. They have a 12oz soda on the menu, I was told it was 16oz and then handed a 12oz cup of soda. When I pointed it out the employee said, \"it says 16 on our thing\" and shrugged. Again, why should she actually care?

Not sure why Wendy's that used to be here went down, but this place better get a little more involved in its own success or there won't be any..."}
{"text":"Went into try the place out.  When I placed my order for here, I was given a number to put on my table so that they could bring it to me.  20minutes later and still no food.  When I asked about my meal I was asked what I had ordered.  The clerked finished my sentence and then said, wide eyed, \"that was you!  We had wondered who that belonged to, we thought it was a drive thru order\".  I heard her say to the other staff \"that meal we couldn't place actually belonged to #92 who was sitting out there\".  You would have thought that the four people working their would have made the connection between a mystery order and a customer sitting for 20 minutes waiting for food, which they clearly noticed.  When I did finally get my meal, the onion rings were cold and the chili dog was disgusting.  Despite the fact that I was clearly upset and that it was pretty clear the food had been sitting out, no attempt at getting me fresh food or offering me a full or partial refund or even a coupon was made.  The manager walked by and did not even acknowledge me.  I am definitely not going back"}
{"text":"Update on my opinion. I wanted a gyro sandwich. I saw the gyro platter up on the menu, but could not find the sandwich, so I asked. I got a plain plate of gyro meat with a lemon,slice and a plastic ramekin of tzatziki. When I asked, the server just shrugged. When I went back to the counter I was told I had to orde a pita gyro to get a sandwich. No apologies. She knew what I had meant when I ordered, altho I did not call it by their exact name. I described what I wanted. So now? No more business from me."}
{"text":"The service was great, the burger's were yummy and the fries were better than I've had in a long time. Very clean place. Their food was very fresh, So why eat at McDonald's.  Try their ghost pepper burger, but get the sauce on the side if your into spicy food, otherwise it might sneak up on you. Fed two adults for under $12."}
{"text":"I just placed the simplest order with the instructions not to use any bun on a burger due to my allergies with gluten. I waited the 50mins for the delivery and long behold it had a bun on it. I called to make the complaint and apparently they're more uneducated as I thought because they forgot to put me on hold and I over heard their complete conversation on how stupid it is and just take off the bun. My allergic reaction to gluten is an extreme case and would need to be rushed the emergency room. Oh and I am still out $17. Don't eat here. They have no consideration for your health nor any idea on how to conduct themselves in a place of business."}
{"text":"I must be in the minority here. I tried Eat24 delivery for the first time and I was quite satisfied with the experience.

The Eat24 ordering interface was usable and efficient. They didn't ask me extra dumb questions or force me to sign up somewhere else. I ordered an Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger with extra Swiss, Ortega pepper, and Thousand Island. I also specified in the special instructions: no ice in drink.

My food arrived in 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Yes, my confirmation email was postmarked 5:36pm and by the time I closed the door and glanced at my computer, it was 5:51. I must say that is a great performance. The delivery man was smiling and helpful, but in a hurry (aren't they all?)

My order arrived exactly as specified. I am especially picky about the \"NO ICE\" orders I make. I will save you the rant. It was a lot of food. A generous packet of fries with the nice savory crust on them that I love. Not too much salt. A few packets of Hunt's ketchup were included but I used my own lime mayo. I ate the fries first, and I was nearly full already. The burger was a single patty but huge. It dropped some lettuce as I ate but generally stayed together. Points for that. I love Ortega peppers! I almost ordered the Ortega burger, but there was no description available. Anyway, this had the best of all worlds with bacon, avocado, and Ortega. The food wasn't hot, but it was clearly freshly made. And I have scalded my tongue enough times to say that hot food is overrated.

I will definitely order this way again. The price was about the usual for delivery these days - $23 with 15% tip. Of course, I had ordered the most expensive burger with extras. I don't frequent this part of town and I have never walked into this restaurant, but I am glad it came up in a Yelp search. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for some fries and a chocolate malt after the firework show at Steele Indian School Park. The malt was super malty and delicious, and fries were excellent (my boyfriend especially liked them, could not stop raving about them as we ate). I like mine extra crispy so I will probably ask for that next time and try a burger. Overall great experience. Staff and owner(s) were very friendly. Would definitely recommend stopping by and giving them a try. :)"}
{"text":"The burger really was just subpar. The meat wasn't juicy nor flavorful. I got the ghost pepper burger and I couldn't even taste the spicy in it. To be fair, I'm a spice feen so it takes a lot for me to think something is spicy. However, my boyfriend who has a normal spice-o-meter could taste a hint of spice but it wasn't spicy to him either. 

The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the ranch is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. Some of the best I've ever had. And if you're on a budget, the $0.49 burger is a filling meal for the price."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a drive through place. Burger Rush takes a sit-down approach to a fast food restaurant. Decent food, fair prices, and fast service - great for someone who wants good food, on the go."}
{"text":"Pros:  Burgers are a-okay.  Charbroiled flavor, fresh toppings, and it tastes like it just came off the grill.  Options of swiss, cheddar, American, and I think I saw pepper jack cheese too.  I personally don't like the shredded lettuce on a burger cuz i think the only place that stuff should be used is on a taco.   French fries are thick with a slightly crispy exterior.  
Not my favorite hamburger but a really good option -and a thousand times better than anything you could get at McDonalds.  
Cons:  Drive thru person was both overly anxious to take our order but slow to get the details right.  It wasn't a complicated order -a hamburger with swiss, a double with swiss, and a double with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mayo and an order of fries.
I'm super pleased to say although it took a little longer than expected the order did come out perfectly."}
{"text":"It's not worth your time I have Been hung up on trying to order food  I give zero stars"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! Makes it super convenient that they are on uber eats!! Great food!! I'm glad that this place exists. Employees re great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good, but I've only had burgers and their breakfast which using hard, but I have no complaints. 

The have a drive-thru, but I've only ever used delivery. I love that I can get breakfast anytime and delivered to my door. I usually get the French toast, an omelet, or an egg sandwich. The mini sliders are great too. 

Delivery does usually take 45min to an hour, but it's worth it in my opinion. I'd say at least give it a try especially if your contemplating and other fast food over Burger Rush, you might as well try it I think it's way better."}
{"text":"Far better fast food burger places out there. Burgers here are very average. Been there twice and each time I felt blah afterward.  The empty booth next to me looked like a burger exploded, lettuce, tomato and fries everywhere on the table, seat and floor. In my 15 minutes there just about every employee walked past it and nobody cleaned it up. It was very slow at the time. This place lacks leadership."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich at 8:00 through Grubhub... It finally got to my apartment by 10, the burger was messy and the bread was falling apart. After struggling to eat it I was about two thirds done, I looked down at my sandwich and I was DISGUSTED to see the chicken was bright pink and no where near fully cooked. 

After waiting long for a sloppy sandwich that wasn't even fully cooked I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the place after my first order. I read some other folks' reviews about foul ups with delivery orders, but decided to give it a try anyway being stuck at home with an injured back. I paid a premium to order through Eat24, figuring it would be harder to mess up without having to hear me on the phone over a load kitchen. However instead of a nice & light turkey burger with no tomato and no mayo, I got a double cheeseburger drowning in mayonnaise with tomatoes. I ate it of course, because I was starving, but it was not good. The french fries were undercooked and soggy, with he consistency of wet noodles. Gross. 

There were some good things - food showed up in about 45 minutes, driver was friendly, and they got my beverage right. The tuna salad I ordered for later wasn't terrible. I probably won't order again though."}
{"text":"I posted a photo last month of a sharp, plastic shard I found in my sundae. I had swallowed a second piece just moments before, not realizing something was wrong until my throat was in pain. No one from Burger Rush has attempted to contact me and explain what the heck sharp plastic was doing in their food. I have not eaten there since and will be sure to continue to let people know about this horrifying and painful experience. Never again, burger rush. I miss Wendy's. I never had my throat cut by plastic shards in my frosty."}
{"text":"Nacho burger was amazing. One of ghe best butgers I had. Meat was fress, juicy, and full of flavor. Their sauce is perfect. Even their plain hamburger was amazing. Fresh ingredients. One of the only fre restaurants I will return to in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never heard of this place. Cowboy burger was amazing. Frys were amazing! Got the cheese wiz too. Yummy yummy! Fast delivery. Great quality! Highly recommend this place. Like other reviews stated, be sure to include cheese on your burger."}
{"text":"I love the food here. But the delivery takes over an hour and a half every time I've ordered with them. It's kind of disappointing when you have to wait almost 2 hours to get your dinner even when you live only 10 minutes away...."}
{"text":"Not bad I'm hoping they will keep the hours open till 3 am we will come back"}
{"text":"WOW!! What a treat. I'm in town visiting family and they suggest a new burger place in town and boy do I love a burger. This place was great. They have amazing burgers but also a good variety of other things you don't find in a burger place like a pastrami sandwich. I had a caramel shake to go with my chili cheese fries and burger and I was so satisfied. I wish I had a burger rush where I lived cause I'd be there often. It was a good place to get a great meal at a great price and the hours they are open for business is awesome. The staff was friendly and helped me in picking my meal since I was so overwhelmed by all the great options. The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting. When I come back to visit I will definitely be stopping in again. Thanks for a great experience and a fantastic meal that truly satisfied."}
{"text":"Great hours:  breakfast  - midnight!  WIde variety of foods. delivery offered for a  minimal fee.  Drive thru takes some time because the food is freshly made."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru on a last minute whim. I was almost overwhelmed at all the choices but they offer a great selection. My 14 year old opted for a chilli burger combo and I went for a cup of chicken, rice and veggie soup. The burger was amazing fries were hot and crispy. Soup was tasty just like momma's! Immediately texted a friend and told them to try the place. Also the lady running the drive thru was super friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"We placed our order via amazon prime now restaurants. Had a customized request and ordered some extras. our deliver window was between 6:44pm and 7:09pm. we checked the status at 6:50 and it says that a driver has our order. a few minutes later, it says that our order is still being processed. 7:05pm rolls around and our order is still being processed. I have customer support call me, and apparently our order was not even started when the driver arrived. So the driver left.  I finally get the notification that our order is on it's way around 7:10.  It was finally delivered at 7:21pm. 1hour and 12 minutes after ordering. 

Order - 
Hula burger on ciabatta.  Hubby said burger was messy and beef tasted like it was previously frozen. 
Ortega burder on ciabatta. Beef again tasted like it was previously frozen 
Kids chicken tenders.
Chili cheese fries with onions. special instructions- chili and cheese to be on the side. Received a huge pile of soggy chili cheese fries 
Extra sauces - 2 ranches, 1 thousand island.  Did not receive. 
Shake - strawberry. Received hair at no extra charge. 

After finding the hair, we were done with dinner."}
{"text":"I anxiously watched for the opening of this \"burger\" place. Today was my third visit. I had burgers the first two times and they were decent but way too large for me. I tried to order the kid's burger and have them dress it like a regular burger, but they were not able to do that. I like Habit because they will let you order a kid's meal and dress it up for smaller appetites like mine. Today I had the chicken tostada salad. It also was very large (I could have made two meals of it). There was a lot of chicken cut up into tender, well-seasoned cubes. The lettuce was fresh and crisp, no brown leaves to be found. I ordered the chipotle ranch dressing and it was also very good. The salad was served with sour cream, choice of dressing and tricolor tortilla chips. So far, so good. My main criticism is regarding the service. The first time, the server at the drive through was friendly and helpful although not very knowledgeable. The next two times the server (different one from my first visit) gave me the wrong amount due (claimed he is dyslexic) and seemed to have major issues with figuring out how to use his computer and take the order. It had to be repeated several times. Today was a repeat of that experience. The greeting, attitude of the server and a final thank you leave much to be desired. Wish they could combine the food with the crisp, friendly service of In-N-Out!"}
{"text":"Came here got simple classic burgers and fries. I think they use mesquite in flavoring, unfortunately I'm not a fan, but that's not their fault. I will say that the burger was hearty and the ranch was quite tasty. I'm definitely willing to go back and try something different"}
{"text":"I've seen this place any number of times, as I drive past it on my way to work but just recently had a free lunch space open to go check it out. I wanted to get a turkey burger, but they were out so I ordered a regular burger with a side of fries.

The burger had a nice, char grilled flavor but the bun was a bit dry and somewhat crumbly (not my favorite thing), and the fries had some sort of nice spicy coating that was especially nice. 

Unfortunately I'm trying to cut down on such food in my time of middle age (the whole heart attack thing is a drag right?) but seems like a fun place with nice staff. I probably won't go there again but if you like to eat burgers on a regular basis it might be worht checking out."}
{"text":"Would give no stars if I could. So many things bad about this experience. Ordered delivery, took an okay amount of time, but delivery person was EXTREMELY rude to us. I wish I didn't tip her. Then got back to my room and found they gave me a buffalo chicken wrap instead of a chicken caesar wrap. The tinfoil around the wrap even said chicken caesar on it. But when I bit into it, it was super spicy and I could not eat it. Do not order from here. I've read a lot of other reviews that say they mess up the orders and I'm telling you it's true. Plus the delivery woman was very rude. DO NOT ORDER OR EAT FROM THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try it since I pass it everyday on my way to work. I order the cheeseburger combo and also got a small order of fried zucchini. Awesome cheeseburger. It was like old school style (Bob's big boy), with the thousand island dressing, the works, on a sesame bun. The fries on the other hand were just OK. I expected fresh old school style fries, but they were just like the regular fries at burger king. It had that coating on it. Eh! The small order of zucchini was large enough to be shared by 2 or 3 people, and tasted a little on the bland side. Great coating on it though and it could have benefited from having more than 1 tiny container of ranch to go with it. I tried the drive-thru and that was a big mistake. It took too long (definitely not even close to the speed of most fast food joints) and I was late getting back to work. Try it when you have more than enough time on your hands."}
{"text":"Had to come back this time I tried an classic double cheese burger it was awesome, my daughter had Ortega burger and she can't stop talking about it. MUST TRY"}
{"text":"Huge menu. Something for everyone! They do breakfast stuff too. Nice local to go burger spot with a lot of choices."}
{"text":"Cons: couldn't find anything to complain about

Pros: the cheeseburger was great! Nice flavor, great combination of toppings, (lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, thousand island, and pickles) I love how they give out yellow peppers and jalapeños, the fries were great as well. The girl working behind the counter was very nice and helpful. I explained to her that it was my first time being in Burger Rush and she gave me the run down on the menu. I will be back to try to chili dogs... I also like how they have the Coca Cola freestyle machines... Great choice of beverages...

I like this place and will be back... 

I see that they have a great \"happy hour\" with lower priced food options... A steal if you ask me..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos. They come with homemade salsa but I recommend ordering the Chipotle sauce. Burgers are good I've had most of them and would recommend the Nacho burger and the Hawaiian AKA Big Kahuna Burger. Fries and Onion Rings are great and don't miss out on the ranch. I've never had a problem with the staff, they're very nice. Support local business."}
{"text":"So, this restaurant fucked up our entire to go order, after making us wait 10 minutes for food. None of our three burgers were correct, including having mushrooms on one that was specifically requested to NOT have mushrooms because my boyfriend is ALLERGIC to them. The French fries were soggy and half cooked, STILL COLD! We called the restaurant, no offer to fix the food, no offer to refund our money, when we specifically ASKED for a refund, we were told that a MANAGER could NOT give us a refund. This place is terrible, and I'll tell EVERYONE about how they stole our money for a meal that we can't even eat."}
{"text":"It's one of the best burger places in Phoenix, and overall perhaps the most eclectic fast food place I've ever seen. 

I've had a decent salad here. I've had great hummus and pita here. If I so desired, I'm pretty sure I could get a breakfast burrito, gyro, hot dog, variety of other sandwiches, or a *pizza* here as well. I swear up and down that establishments housing gargantuan menus can't be good, and so far I am being proven wrong. 

But you wanna hear about the burgers right? 

They're pretty gosh darn good. I like the buns and I like the beef. I'm a fan of the Cowboy Burger, with its plentiful bacon and fried onions. The fries are perfect as well, with the seasoned, crunchy exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. The price of the combo is really competing against some premium chains--and winning. Fans of establishments like Five Guys should like this more. 

Every day, during my lunch break, I'll be fighting the urge to step into Burger Rush and chowing down. Give it a try so I may live vicariously through you."}
{"text":"Came at lunch time, Wasn't very busy.  I've driven by a million times, Used to eat here when it was Wendy's.   

Since I was in the area and was starving I figured what the heck. 

Asked for a recommendation from the girl at the counter.  She recommended the ABC (Avacado, Bacon, Cheese) and yes.. it was delicious.  I ended up with the meal that included fries and a drink.  I also ordered the chipotle ranch to dip my fries into. Total was a little over $11.  A little over priced for lunch.  

But the burger was good, (bottom bun was a little mushy likely because of the lettuce water.  The avacado was perfect, the bacon and burger were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The fries were the best part of the entire meal. 
I will likely be coming back again. 

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"New location for this burger franchise by the original owner. Place is really clean and freshly remodeled. Classy for a burger joint. Modern. Extensive menu covers way more than burgers. I'm told plans are to add pizza and wings next. 

The food was fresh, quick, hot and delicious. My burger was cooked med to med rare. I can attest that they use quality ingredients. Fries were fresh and flavorful. Perfectly salted. Burger was pretty big. Much larger than fast food places. 

Staff dressed in uniform. Not sure if they always do this, but it wasn't too busy when I was here at 3pm, and they were bringing food to the tables. Drive through opening soon, and delivery... This place will be unstoppable. Great addition to downtown."}
{"text":"For a drive-thru burger, you could do worse.  The burger was decent but the fries were below average.  There are better burger places in the area, but if you want something fast and want to use a drive-thru, then this place isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"I have been there 12 times and The food is actually ok for fast food but it is very inconsistent and the service is terrible. My order has been wrong at least 5 times and when I complained to the owner/manager JR he blamed it on his \"lazy and incompetent employees.\" He yells at his employees in front of customers, expects perfection for minimum wage and actually yelled at 2 of my coworkers for not ordering fast enough for him. He is going to be sorry soon enough because my office of 160 people is right up the street and due to the inconsistency in good food, the horrible service and JR'S shitty attitude, nobody wants to go back there. For what they charge for food the experience should be a lot better."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place at lunch today. Good, decent sized burgers that are flame broiled, the way I like it. I think Chuckbox has some competition in North Tempe now! It's a little more expensive than other burger places if you want the combo meal, but hey, it's far better than Mickey-D's. I'll be back to try their breakfast.

Follow up - they may have changed the size of their patties recently, because there was a lot of meat on my burger. I don't get what some of these other reviewers are talking about."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on fri nite and We loved it unlike most food in arizona it was open past 9pm and the service food and employees were awesome 

Burgers were huge fresh tasty  char broiled and when you buy 1 they give you another for 49 cents 

Rib eye steak sandwish was yummy fries hot and plenty prices niceeeee. 

Met the owner and his son both very cool  and generous 

I  live on 7th street and dobbins and pleaded him to open in south phoenix 

If you have been here and dont have something good to say then your taste buds need adjusting 

If you know east coast diner fresh food then burger rush is the place to be

My fellow NJ and NYC foodies find this place 

Tasted better than 5 guys chuck box and in and out. .......  marc b."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The prices are awesome. You will get your money worth at this place and leave full and happy.   I like the fact that this place stays open pretty late. They do have random hours at night time so call before you head over. My favorite burger is the mushroom burger. I can't seem to try any other ones but this one. My entire family like this place. We drive by many hamburgers places on our way to Burger Rush and no matter what we choose burger rush over any of the others. There is truly nothing bad to say about this spot."}
{"text":"The milkshakes are their only saving grace, however there was a hair in mine..

Ordered a chili cheeseburger combo and a chili cheese hot dog side of chili cheese fries.  We ended up getting a regular cheeseburger combo, chili cheese hotdog and onion rings.  

I personally didn't like their chili, and their onion rings tasted as though they had sat out and were fried again for crispness.  They were greasy and falling apart, just scraps in a bag.  The burger was underwhelming, fries were seasoned nicely.  

It was a let down, pretty pricey for mediocre food and rude workers. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"They upcharged me for a breakfast sandwich on a bagel then put it on a hamburger bun.  I ordered through ubereats so I didn't know until I was already back at my desk.  I used ubereats because I was working and had no time to either get it myself or go and address it with them."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast this mornings got an omelet was amazing defiantly will be coming back fast friendly.service what more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Flame grilled burgers and the best ranch! Lots of fries when you order a combo. I had the bacon egg burger combo and paid about $12. Thought it was a bit pricey but totally worth it! Lots of food! All of the workers seem to like their job which gives better service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After a Royals spring training game at the Cubs park, we hit this place because it was after 10 pm and the Yelp reviews/pics told us we wouldn't be disappointed.  I'm telling you, this was outstanding.  I had the Colossal Burger that has pastrami on it...OMG...divine.  Hubby had the Rib Eye Steak Sandwich, and it may have been even more divine.  We shared a fry and enjoyed those as well.
And, they had bottles of Mexican Coke which made me so happy.  I so wish we could have hit this place once more while we were in AZ.

Will definitely be making a stop here during '18 Spring Training."}
{"text":"After three visits to the Burger Rush I have to share my findings because it is that good.  
The first two times I had the usual cheeseburger, fries and a soda.  I was amazed because my order was not just the usual it was above and beyond.  They are top of the list for taste, value and amount of food.  Well worth the money.  Last week I tried the teriyaki chicken bowl.  I work near buy and I'm always on the road so I needed something to go.  Once I finally had time to eat, I was very happy as it was so yummy.  I had also picked up some Carrot Cake.  OMG, this has to be the BEST Carrot Cake I have ever had.  It's because of the carrot cake that I feel compelled to share my experiences.  I highly recommend this place to everyone.  The customer service is outstanding.  On my second visit I was greeted by the owner/boss and I found him to be a true gentleman and a sincere business man that puts the customer first.  I hope that everyone will support this locally owned  business.  Why visit some chain place when quality, value and taste is right here at Burger Rush on Central Ave in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had the avocado bacon burger and blue cheese burger, both good. Cheesy bacon fries are delicious but don't get the nachos. Nice sized portions but too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Decent food, clean restaurant, a little pricey for the quality, $6 burger, $5 chilli cheese fries. Burger patty had a good taste, chilli had a tomato sauce taste, wouldn't recommend it, fries were pretty good. You can get a similar burger at Lenny's or burger shop for less. Grade: C"}
{"text":"Had a colossal Burger which i couldn't even finish.. AWESOME! Then I had an order of zucchini to share with my friends... AWESOME! Then to finish it off , I had the best ressies milk shake! I will be coming back! (: AWESOME!"}
{"text":"What a remarkably average burger. What wasnt average was the price for a single combo being over 10 bucks. I'd pay half that and still probably be disappointed. The menu says they are mesquite fired. Funny,  there wasnt even grill marks on the completely unseasoned patty. Didn't even smell like a wood fire let alone mesquite. 1st and last time here for sure."}
{"text":"Well, I just have to say these folks still deserve 5-stars anyway even though I got a soggy Burger because they were really cool about it and without giving me any sort of hard time whatsoever they just simply remade the sandwiches right on guys keep up the good work"}
{"text":"First time at Burger Rush today. Really tasty, and I will return. They have a wide selection of menu items (not just burgers), and a lot of it looks really good. I can attest that the Italian Wedding soup, chili, patty melt, and fries are all really good. I saw another reviewer that said the fries were greasy, but that was not our experience.

They don't have waiter service, but they do deliver the meals to your table, and they cater, if you need that.

I'll go back often!"}
{"text":"Fries were room temp. Drive through staff was friendly enough. Cool alternative to the drive through burger places down Broadway here. Worlds better. I got a cheese burger and added bacon, made it a combo and payed around eight bucks. Pretty good! Burger was really awesome. A little soggy at the last bit, but that's nothing that bugs me too much. And I'll finish by saying two words that made this burger good: shredded fricken lettuce, guys. So much better! Found my new place when I want something quick and greasy. At three stars I'll be back, but I don't think I'll boast to anyone about going or try too hard to talk anyone in to trying it--but it's good enough for me!"}
{"text":"I have been tempted to try Burger Rush for months. It had been on my bookmarked list for far too long so last night we decided to order it for delivery. We ordered the Cowboy Burger, the avocado bacon cheeseburger, and the cheesy bacon french fries online through yelp. The total before tip was $27.18. The food was delivered by the right time listed, the driver was friendly, and we loved the burgers and french fries. The portions were large and the two burgers and big order of cheese fries were too much for my boyfriend and I to finish in one sitting. I reheated some of the food today and it still tastes amazing. I am so glad I tried this place and will order again from them in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried several different items off of the menu including a gyro,  a gyro combo plate, an Ortega burger, kraut dog, fried fish sandwich and the sliders. Everything was over a week at different times. Oh yeah and we also shared a chocolate malt. Everything has been good and fresh the service has always been very friendly and welcoming. If you like Greek food I definitely suggest to try gyro or the gyro platter combo first.  If you want a snack get a slider they're pretty big. I hope that this location does very well because the area really needed a new place to go to especially because they offer a variety of food and breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Kind of a trip walking into what used to be a McDonald's for many years.  But beyond the floor plan, that's where the similarity ends.  Extensive menu includes a variety of burgers, sandwiches, even breakfast.  Classic burger was quite tasty and a good value.  The fries were hot and crisp.  Nice music playing, spiffed-up decor, ketchup in bottles instead of packets.  Fast food but in an alternate (and better) reality."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have driven by this place and never expected the quality we received. From the second we walked in the door we were greeted with excellent customer service. I ordered the Ortega burger which had a perfect amount of spice and an enormous amount of flavor. Don't even get me started on the fries...they were jaw dropping. Amazing. I want more just writing this. 

I was surprised to hear the cashier make a courtesy call about a delivery which is a rarity. Other than the outdated decor, it was an excellent place to have a bite to eat. We watched the football game, ate our burger, and will be back for more! Total gem. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a cowboy burger and fries. The fries were pretty good, though a bit salty. They also give you a lot of them. The burger was good, though heavy. I couldn't finish it but everything on it tasted good. I will likely come back in the future."}
{"text":"CRAZY GOOD! We were expecting fast food and got quality that surpassed our greatest expectations.  Why anyone would give less than 5 stars for the food here? I ordered the   Cowboy Bacon Burger with onion rings. My husband ordered the Ortega Burger with fries and our daughter ordered the Chicken Sandwich with fried zucchini.  All the sandwiches were HUGE, mesquite wood fired and the flavor was AMAZING! My daughter loved her chicken and gave me a bite and it was so moist and tender with the mesquite flavor. We all agreed that the fried zucchini was the best side.  The fries were also amazing.  I'm saying this is REAL FOOD, not fast food.  You would be CRAZY not to try it!  Just saying....................."}
{"text":"I love the burger, the plain one
That's too much sauce
I was soon Hungry Ayyy
That's too much sauce"}
{"text":"This place just open and is really great! The food came out before I had even found a table and everything inside was clean and brand new. Staff was friendly and the food was pretty quality for the price!"}
{"text":"Perfect, cheap, and tasty place to get some food if you're hungry. I always order from them off of UberEats and I am never disappointed. They give you so many fries for such a cheap price, and they are crispy/crunchy like a fry is supposed to be!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. Some of the best food in Tempe period. I own The Burly Barber (barbershop in the same parking lot), and I eat here almost everyday for lunch. I've slowly but surely had every item on the menu, and I have yet to be able to find a favorite as each item is level 10 scrumptious! 

Do yourself a flavor and eat here now!!!"}
{"text":"The food is not good at all, the chicken salad is the smallest salad with a few pieces of chicken. The manager was rude and wasn't helpful when we complained about our food. They gave us $10 coupon for delivery only and they only deliver within a few miles. So the coupon was worthless. The only good thing they had was the carrot cake."}
{"text":"They make a decent burger, but they have a bunch of bait & switch advertising painted on their windows. 

It's best to ignore those ads they have posted outside for 49 or 99 cent burgers, you're not walking out of this place with a meal for less than $6-7 bucks. It was something along the lines of a buy one, get one for a bit less.  So if youre just one person trying to get a quick lunch and not be obese, then you have no use for a second cheeseburger. 

I had a burger, fries, and drink, all of it was above average for a sketchy burger dive. The place is kinda dirty, no bugs though so that's a plus i guess. 
Service was meh from the employees, you get vibe that they're trying to do their best in spite of crappy ownership. 
I doubt I'll return to burger rush, but if someone wants a charbroiled burger for about $6-7 bucks, there are worse places to go in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to hotel since I'm from out of town. The app gave the driver the wrong address. However, he was super nice when he called. I had the original burger, cheesy fries & chocolate shake! That was the best burger I've had in a long time!!! Thanks guys....great job!"}
{"text":"The pastrami was either really good or I was really hungry. And the French fries where really good hot and crispy just the way I like em'. 
I placed my order thru yelp and my food was delivered in about 25 minutes from time of order. 
Thanks, will be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"100% pleased with the entire order and service. The employees were very attentive and nice and The restaurant was very clean. It was our first time and we  tried the wraps (which were huge btw)- you go anywhere else and you'll get half the wrap for a larger price. The jalapeño hummus was great! We also tried The fries which were amazing- idk how they fry them but whatever they use was superb and with the lil added seasoning on top...whoo! Everything was AMAZING. I can't wait to go back to try more items off there huge menu selection. I'd rate them 10 stars if I could. Thank you for a great meal and experience."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I'm not quite sure what to call this burger rush. Granted they have burgers, but burgers are only about a third of the menu. 

Moreover this restaurant has everything from kebabs to burgers as well as breakfast and everything imaginable in between. 

We each had one of the Basic cheeseburgers, along with onion rings for one side and fries for the other. The fries were in the greasy. As for the onion rings they really crispy. 

The cheeseburgers weren't bad but they weren't great either. Burger Russia certainly welcome of her second visit but I probably won't get the burgers again"}
{"text":"All I'll say is I'm glad this place isn't within walking distance from my work.

Avo bacon cheeseburger for less than $7. Heck yah! 1/2 an avocado. Oh I hope they never cheap out on that. 4 pieces of actual - real - meaty bacon. 1/3 pound of REAL beef that's cooked on a real grill.

Fries tasted like real potatoes. A bit heavy with oil and enough salt to last a day or two. But, yum! 

Busy place. Order online and show up near the end of the time window and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I just have to say breakfast delivery is AMAZING!! Sometimes you just don't want to get dressed right away or actually leave the house to find food on the weekends. Their breakfast has never disappointed!! Portions are good and they include all the sides. We've ordered breakfast burritos, hash browns, and extra toast. 1 order of toast comes with 2 pieces, the burrito is HUGE, and the hash browns are delicious and a big portion. And breakfast delivered?!?! Yes please!! I've been saying I need this for years and finally I have a place neat me that does it!"}
{"text":"The turkey burger I had at Burger Rush was absolutely amazing!!! It was so juicy and fresh! My husband had the Nacho beef burger and he loved it as well!! There really is something for almost anyone on their menu! Plus their fries were also the perfect addition to our meal!"}
{"text":"At first, I attempted to call this restaurant to place a delivery order, but was told they do not take orders via phone (passé I guess - as we are in a digital-technologically advanced time where phone orders are becoming obsolete). I called because I wanted to make sure they delivered to my hotel and got my order correctly, as I had certain order requests. The gentleman said to put in the comment box (on seamless/Uber eats) what specifics I wanted and they would adhere to them. 

So I ordered the avocado, bacon, cheeseburger without tomato and no 1000 island sauce, and I also asked for a pickle. 45 mins later, I received my burger on soggy bread, no avocado nor pickle, with tomato and 1000 Island. Needless to say they did NOT adhere to my request, AT ALL. And considering this place is 0.3 miles (three blocks) away from my hotel, my food should not have arrived \"warm.\" 

Would I order from here again...Not a chance."}
{"text":"Chili Burgers are perfect. The first time it was a little bit of sauce, but then after the 2nd and 3rd time they had started to pack it. 

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Ok so tried the new EAT24 app for delivery 
Wow what can I say 
The app is nice and found this place

Placed a $70 order.  It was over an hour before we got our food .....  (Said 30-40 minutes. Not !) And no dressing for the wedge salads 
Called the restaurant. The manager said they would credit my cc some $$$ for the mistake.  Didn't help me with salad dressing. (Had to walk over to the gas station for dressing )
Not sure if my cc was credited anything or not.... Will check in the morning 

Will I use the app again ? Maybe 
Will I order from here again if in the area ? Not sure 

Don't get me wrong. The food was good. But really.... I ordered extra dressing and got NONE !

Wow. Someone should check the orders before going out ! 

Good food .... Such a shame you can't get an order right..."}
{"text":"I would just like to say thank you to GrubHub for introducing me to Burger Rush they make awesome burgers french fries and every drink you can think of they have great Burgers sales every day just want to say thank you to Burger Rush for the great food you serve"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place and give it NO stars I would. The burgers are NOT good unless you like sloppy and soggy."}
{"text":"The reviews do not lie -- these fries are good! I'm a fan of thicker fries, not the crispy shoestring kind, so these hit the spot exactly!  They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and just the right amount of salt.

The burgers here are huge (well, ours were huge because we got the double!).  The burger was tasty and I enjoyed it.  The only negative is that I explicitly stated \"no cheese\" on my order form (I ordered through a 3rd party delivery service) and mine still came with cheese and I am allergic to cheese so I had to scrape it off.

We'll be back next time we're craving something unhealthy! :-P"}
{"text":"Pulled in due to the special on the sign, Gyro and Fries $4.99.  Ordered my wife a Cowboy burger and when I went to order the special they said, \"Oh that's tomorrow.  We don't have that tonight\".  I said your sign doesn't say anything about the special being tomorrow, I got the same reply.  Prices were high for the dry burger, overcooked bacon and overly greasy onion rings.  Won't be back anytime soon, too many other places to try.  Will also try and steer family and friends away."}
{"text":"Good food clean place, they just recently opened and this will be one of those places that it's worth it to go to. Next time I come I will have to try the wings.

89cent sliders.... Can't beat that"}
{"text":"This place's saving graces are the fries and large portions. I went twice in a week because I tried the hula hula burger and it was a miss. I figured maybe it was just a one off.  It was dripping with grease which made the bun soggy and the pineapple slices were so thick it was almost impossible to eat. The second time i tried the classic cheese burger. It was perfectly average. Reminded me of a large Burger King burger which isn't really a bad thing. Each time it was the fries that made it worth while. They were cooked to perfection and weren't puny soggy things like most fast food places. I would go back and would not hesitate to recommend it, but really I just want the fries."}
{"text":"Ordered Chili burger with fries. The fries were delicious, the burger was very good as well. Slower service for a drive through but the burgers seemed a lot more fresh than McDonalds etc. definitely plan on returning sometime again"}
{"text":"Yo stop knocking this place because of the Unereats app. Lame.

For those of us who live on the south side, or in Tempe, or just not near an in and out burger I'm telling you this is the spot to go to. The burgers are gigantic and legit. They have a buy one get one for a $0.49 burger after 3 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to close they have a deal where you can get a burger, a sundae, fries and a drink all for $4.99.

What makes this place special is the fact that they hand make everything. One particular item that I absolutely enjoy, which isn't on the drive-thru menu, is there fried broccoli with Chipotle dipping sauce. Check the photo from my review for a comprehensive list of their dipping sauces. What's even better is now they have cheese crisps with handmade fresh pico de gallo and chips. So if you want a quick Mexican food snack I would recommend going here instead of the Filibertos down the street. You can check my review on that particular location as well.

Burger Rush is seriously so freaking delicious and legit I can't say enough good things about them. They have milkshakes as well which are incredible and hotdogs which I haven't tried yet. Oh and by the way they deliver! So if you don't want to go inside or hop in your car and go through the drive-thru just have them bring you your food. 

As someone who spends as much time in bed as I do,  this is a freaking Mecca. 

A++++"}
{"text":"This place is worth a visit. Excellent breakfast deals. I've had breakfast and lunch here. Reminds me of the delicious drive thru burger joints all over SoCal. 
Huge menu selection... Greek, sandwiches, burgers, kabobs, salads. Super friendly service. 
I must say... the meats, lettuce, tomatoes, bread... All super fresh. I read one review where they said the lettuce was bad. Not in my case. I'm really picky about food freshness. No complaints here. I'll be back, most definitely!"}
{"text":"We wanted this place to be awesome so bad but that's all it was was bad want our money back or we're not even going to bother trying to go in everything was bad my Philly cheesesteak Burger was blown out the Patty was actually seasonless the bond was literally soaked through in Grease and I don't mind a greasy burger the zucchini fries were a total joke the batter was Bland horribly tasteless crunchy yet soggy at the same time I don't even know how that's possible stale the wife says Herberger was the only okay thing even the Fry's must have had something wrong with them because our family of four all got sick you all know what I'm talking about when you get jacked up from a fast food joint avoid this place like the plague Danger PS We normally don't review people but when you get my whole family sick then we have a problem. 
P.s.  sooo NOT cheese wiz!  Rip off"}
{"text":"I tried out burger rush because my car was in the shop and it was a burger shop that delivered. I ordered the double combo, a sundae and my friend ordered the egg n burger. The burger tasted like a burnt frozen patty and the sundae was a sorry attempt. Oh and not to mention a 45-60 min delivery time took an hour and 45 minutes. When the food finally arrived it was borderline cold and the sundae melted. I never heard of this place before I ordered and don't care to order again."}
{"text":"Meant to write this review a while back.. oops. To be honest I was fine with the food at burger rush (their chicken fingers are great) but when my boyfriend and I went to go get food there about a month ago all we heard the entire time we were there was the manager (i assume) screaming at his employees, calling them names, and being generally awful towards them.

No one working at a burger joint (or anywhere else for that matter) deserves to get that kind of treatment, especially when you tack delivery on to that job to make it extra stressful. Turned me off for good : / or until I go in and ask if that jerk is gone or treating them better."}
{"text":"There are quite a variety of burgers here to try here however wasn't too impressed with my burger considering the price point- simple burgers start off at $4 and specialty burgers range $6-$10. I ordered the ghost burger with spicy chipotle sauce, it was relatively spicy but not overkill. I wasn't really impressed with it, it was a rather plain burger with some sauce slapped on the bun. My friend ordered the bacon avo burger, which was better but was $8 or so. Probably wouldn't come here again, unless I could catch some of those bargains they advertise on the windows and people have written on here! Not a bad place to try, then!"}
{"text":"I just had the chicken sandwich with fries
Awesome!!!! Very great value
Excellent service and they make you feel like family.
I will be back"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place and I'm hooked! The fries are delicious! I ordered the turkey burger on a whole wheat bun. The turkey burger combo was around $9 after taxes but the burger was large and the fries they gave you were a good size. I will be back again to try the rest of the food!"}
{"text":"They listened.

The radio was not retardedly loud.

Coke machine nicely stocked, not out of most of the flavorings.

They upgraded the fries. Freeking delicious.

For all this I will upgrade their stars.

4 stars...

Great job.

Great burgers."}
{"text":"Burger Rush might throw you off for a couple of reasons....

a.  It look so corporatey and cheesy from the outside that you may not think it produces quality food. 
&
b.  You may think that this place only has burgers. 

They really mess up by their outside marketing but rest assured that this little stop is worth making.  Burgers, CHX sandwiches, Gyros, Steak sandwhiches....and tons more.  The Burgers are huge, amazing, and cheap.  All ingredients used in any and everything I've had are far above your average burger shop.  

Stop in here and try this place!  It's pretty kick ass (and try a shake!)"}
