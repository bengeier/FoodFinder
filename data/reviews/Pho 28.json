{"text":"The tonkinoise soup was like water and it wasn't even that hot. Won't go the second time."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch combo P1 which includes the following:  2 strips of grilled chicken, 1 spring roll (chinese style meatless), white rice and vegetables.  1 mini wonton soup (there's your early indication that they are chinese owned if you dont speak cantonese).   Yays: -spacious, comfortable and clean place with lots of natural light. -plenty of free parking -fast service  Nays: -Did not serve hot tea -Spring roll was double fried and meatless -Rice was too fluffy, indication of microwaved overnight rice. -Grilled chicken portion is very modest -unauthentic vietnamese -pricey for non-pho menu items  There are 2 types of restaurants owners: the passionate ones and those who are just trying to make a living.  Based on this first experience, Pho28 is clearly the latter.  Save your $15 and your time.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Finally a good place of pho around! Friendly staff and good food. Nothing exceptional but would definitely come again because of its good location. Try their beef stew!"}
{"text":"Have been searching for great soups like this for 15 years only to find it in Laval!   The Thai spicy soups are so flavorful, just the best.    Since I live in Laval, this is a great option where we don't have to drive into the city for good pho."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely disgusting! When I asked for more noodle the lady dip her hand in the noodles to get more noodles out a bucket.Secondly the PHO soup was cold and tasteless. Worst experience ever at a restaurant. Real waste of money!!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, large portions and so far I've been pretty satisfied with what I've tried (Pad Thai, chicken fried rice, won ton soup, imperial rolls)."}
{"text":"Came here because our hotel was next door. Definitely not authentic pho. Owner by Chinese and they cooked the fried spring roll like Chinese spring roll. Ordered their bun bo hue and it tasted like they used the bun bo hue paste that can be found on any Chinatown shelf. Would not recommend if you are looking for real Vietnamese food. Gave two star for the service."}
{"text":"You know what?! Although pho bang New York remains my favourite, I give this place a solid 4 stars. The resto is situated in a chomedy strip mall right next to the Adonis. Seating was cozy, restaurant presented as very clean. The waitress wasn't very helpful in suggesting the dishes, however, I vaguely knew what I wanted. I originally came because I was craving a healthy, oriental soup... That's when \"Vietnamese pho\" came to mind! I ordered the tonkinese grilled chicken pho. I have to say, the extra large is HUGE for the price! Soup was generous in chicken, vegetables and vermicelli noodles as evidenced by my picture. I definitely left this place feeling full, satisfied and remain with a heavy pocket."}
{"text":"Je suis fan de ce Pho'! Lol J'y vais depuis l'ouverture et je ne suis jamais déçue. J'aime aussi la soupe au ragoût de buf, la soupe à la citronnelle et les rouleaux de printemps quoique un peu chers pour une entrée qui coûte moins de la moitié à faire. Les autres items au menu sont moins intéressants selon moi.  Le Pho' vaut vraiment le déplacement. Je le commande toujours avec un café glacé."}
{"text":"All was fulfilling although not to the achievement of Pho Bang New York located in Chinatown. The pho portions are standards but the share of meat is quite skim. The spring rolls are good but had to much noodle fillings. I would probably be back only because I would hate driving all the way downtown and find a parking spot..."}
{"text":"Un restaurant de pho très moyen qui pourrait faire beaucoup mieux. J'y vais parce que contrairement à Montréal, il n'y a pas de bons restos vietnamien qui se démarque à Laval et c'est le seul endroit où on peut commander une ph avec un choix de viande acceptable. Mais le gout n'y est pas.   Le bouillon goute que la cannelle mais pas d'anis étoilé et il manque une richesse et un gout traditionnel. Le flanc est raide ce qui porte à croire que la viande ne bouille pas assez longtemps. Ils ne fournissent jamais assez de basilic et c'est impossible d'avoir de la sauce au poisson (nuoc mam) car si on en demande, ils amènent un minuscule bol de nuoc cham..c'est pas pareille. Les boulettes goûtent le décongelé.   Le décor et l'ambiance est quand même très bien, c'est joli et actuel. Mais si on est de ceux qui aimons s'assoir dans une banquette il y en a que 4 (plus une demi banquette à l'autre mur du resto mais la moitié des gens doivent prendre une chaise) et une d'elles est condamné en lieu de pause pour les employés. Je ne crois pas jamais avoir vu ça ailleurs, une banquette réservé au détriment de la clientèle et je trouve que ça manque de classe. Ils pourraient utiliser l'espace perdu en dessous de la télé qui ne sert à rien pour dormir sur leur coussin quand c'est tranquille! Aussi, il serait bon d'éviter les salles de bain car depuis l'ouverture de ce restaurant je doute qu'ils aient été nettoyés. Mais moi j'utilise le verre d'eau gratuit qu'on nous verse quand on s'assoit. Il y a tellement de chlore dans l'eau que ça nettoie bien les mains. (Quand on est chanceux, ils mettent des limes et ça dégraisse encore mieux!)  Le service est passable mais la serveuse qui est le plus souvent là est vraiment impersonnelle et on sent qu'elle n'aime pas ce qu'elle fait. Probablement parce qu'elle ne connais pas vraiment la langue française et qu'on la dérange quand on lui parle. Il faut surtout pas oublier de tout demander avant d'avoir nos plats parce qu'elle ne revient plus après pour savoir si tout va bien. Et il faut s'attendre à être servi en désordre aussi. (Exemple: le plat principal avant l'entrée)  Ce resto vaut la peine seulement si on désire vraiment manger une pho et que l'on veut/peut pas aller à Montréal. Ils manquent clairement de concurrence pour qu'ils puissent assumer que plusieurs améliorations pourraient être fait. Si on veut manger autre choses que la soupe, d'autres restos vietnamien sont équivalents à Laval."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Don't feel like being harsh but for someone who eats vietnamese and has a great appreciation for food and taste, this place just didn't cut it for me. It's the same exact menu as Pho88 which is located on decarie and queen Mary, the same prices..but food portions were so small and taste was not great, there's just 1 waitress and when it came for payment she gave us the bill and passed out payment for another table.  Excuse me. A table of 10 makes a difference to a table of 4. I get people make mistakes but if it's dead you should look twice. Very unsatisfied.  Will definitely not return. If you want good vietnamese try their sister company Pho88"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Pho 28 with a fellow Yelper and we went with the bun noodles with grilled chicken and spring roll. I also added a Won Ton soup. In general, I quite enjoyed the meal though I'll admit I've tasted better. Nothing really stood out but everything was still pretty good!  Pho 28 is restaurant one can actually get some actual authentic Vietnamese cuisine and not that cheap Quebec stir-fry that tends to mask itself as such. That's a huge issue in Laval, the land of franchises and mediocrity.   The food here is served relatively swiftly with a cheap price attached to it... so that makes this place a great place to enjoy a quick economic yet tasty lunch. My only disappointment here was not being served some hot tea, which would have nicely hit the spot... particularly with it being -30 outside.   Lastly, they only accept CASH or INTERACT... so yeah, come prepared.  My fortune cookie said \"I'll live life to its fullest\", which of course I already did... by going on lunch with D'Arcy. :P"}
{"text":"So nice to have a hot soup in a cold day, especially after a long business meeting.  Good comfort food.  Sometimes a hot hot pho is better than an expensive dinner."}
{"text":"Enfin, j'ai trouvé mon restaurant vietnamien à Laval après plusieurs mois de recherche et d'essais.  Les soupes sont immenses, savoureuses. Il manque parfois de viande mais ce n'est que occasionnel. Les plats riz/viande sont  bons et très satisfaisants. L'endroit est toujours occupé lors des heures de dîner ou souper mais le service reste très rapide."}
{"text":"They have changed owners.   Their pho soup is watered down as well as their sriracha and hoisin sauce. Their deep fried wontons have shrunk half in size. Is it true that it is Chinese owned restaurant.  I do not recommend eating at this restaurant. Horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Really I'm happy we have some authentic Vietnamese now in Laval. You see boys and girls there is lots of craptacular quality Quebec Stir Fry that disguises itself Vietnamese or Thai. This is the real deal with Pho and Bun noodle dishes with a Chicken, beef and pork. Just as your Vietnamese mom would approve of shouting \"make sure you eat your noodles boy\"!   So I met a fellow Yelper to break bread (err noodles) over some conversation and enjoy a meal together. We had come here at 11:45 AM in case there was a lunch rush. Restaurant was not too busy but filled up a bit more as we were eating.   We had both selected a bun noodles with grilled chicken and spring roll. As I love spring rolls I ordered another order of two more to compliment my meal. All was tasty a good mix it's vegetables and just as I expect when enjoying a Vietnamese noodle dish. It's all about fresh vegetables with chicken and the crunch of spring rolls. I mix it all together and add some sriracha. This is a complete meal. It's hit the spot satisfying.   The restaurant only approves cash or interact. Come prepared.   Definitely I will come back and check something else out! I hope this place flourishes as it's good to see small restaurants be able to make a living in the land of chain restos!"}
{"text":"The soups are good although I find there wasnt enought meat in the raw beef and meat balls soup. I strongly dont recommend the spring rolls, very oilly and no texture."}
{"text":"Best pho around. The special is my favourite and the scrimb spring roll is the best. If you are in Laval, you must eat there."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good, the food was excellent. I had the Three Coloured Rice. The chicken and pork were grilled to perfection, the rice was nice and fresh, the vegetables were nice and cold, and the egg was cooked eggs-actly how i asked. (sorry, i had to)  However, here's the bad news. The service was kind of terrible. The workers were nice, however they kept screwing up our orders & when we went to pay, the change they gave us was $20 short. We asked them about the change & the women said it was right, she then had to punch it into the calculator to find out she was terribly wrong.  We're in Quebec on vacation. If I visit again & I'm in the mood for pho, this will definitely be a possibility."}
{"text":"For Laval this is pretty good. I had the BBQ chicken but told them to not give me any rice or noodles which they did and added more veggies. Chicken was excellent and tried my wifes soup from her noodles which was most important to me and that to was very good. So DaWife was happy and she plans to go back instead of going all the way down town."}
