{"text":"I ordered the Bacon Butty with cheese and brown sauce. They must make their own -- it's fabulous.

In fact, this sandwich provided some of the best bites of food I've ever tasted. EVER. Crispy, fresh, hot, perfectly seasoned. LOVE."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, what with all the rave reviews and delicious looking pictures and menu ...  The bf and i have been eyeing this place for a while. So sorely disappointed that all I could taste out of my Hogtown sandwich was saltiness. Not even the brown sauce could add any dimension to the palate. The bread was sooo good though, perfectly crisp... Man, it was all there except for the taste! The bf got the Full Monty and that was definitely more flavorful but still all in all... We were definitely expecting more. Maybe we just ordered wrong? We could give this place another try but don't think that'll be any time soon.."}
{"text":"I picked up one of the Bacon Butty w/ fried egg for my wife and a Hogtown Sandwich. My wife absolutely loved the bacon Butty and complemented how perfectly the egg was cooked. My Hogtown Sandwich was good, but nothing special. 

Two sandwiches cost me $15 after tax, which some may say is pricey, but as long as you don't eat it everyday, I would say it's reasonable."}
{"text":"Congratulations to Rashers - you took an ingredient like bacon and made people enjoy it. It's a bit like making friends by giving them lots and lots of money.

Good food + stupid prices + Corporate-Cool = Classic Toronto"}
{"text":"I just got back from ordering the Hogtown with Cheese & Egg.

Brown sauce = Done in-house (I asked.)  Excellent flavour.
Aged White Cheddar Cheese = Great contrast and tasty.
Bun = Soft and Fresh; the way it should be.
Peameal Bacon = Super tender and cooked just right.  Melt-in-your-mouth good.
Egg = It's an egg.  It was good.

Service = Friendly, personable, and professional.  Both cooks were dressed in full blacks.  The place was clean and organized.

Overall = Very strong first impression.  I'll be back to have the Bacon Butty next time, and then I'll just work my way down their menu.  A very solid addition to the growing Leslieville market, and a worthwhile visit for the epicurious."}
{"text":"The brie bacon(well done) with caramelized onions and garlic aioli is the closest thing to heaven in the east. I've had this delicacy countless times and am proud to be partially responsible for its permanent place on the menu. Oh \"I'm not a brie fan\" you say. Well when they toast the brie into a smooth layer and bind it with the garlic aioli, new dimensions open and brie reaches full stride. Its a texture and flavour explosion on a grand scale. This is coming from a former flagrant brie hater."}
{"text":"The beer battered BLT is one of my favourite sandwiches of all time. So good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. I wasn't blown away, but the bacon butty with brown sauce that I had was pretty tasty. The potato wedges on the side were okay.

Overall it did seem a little pricey to me for what you get."}
{"text":"Go go go!
Crushes all competition instantly!
Dynamite sandwiches and super friendly people working there.
The potato wedges are delicious!
This one's a no-brainer if you love bacon!
Don't forget to leave them a tip at the counter ;-)"}
{"text":"Today, the cook sneezed right into her hands with me 3 feet from her... removed the goods from the grill and then carried my egg sandwich with those hands and wrapped my sandwich up without even thinking of visiting a sink to wash up. The only reason this doesn't have a one star is because good employees are tough to find and I've been here about 10 times and -- used to -- love it.  I spent $11.00 on the sandwich and threw it right in the garbage after leaving, you can see my posted pic... it looks great but all I can imagine is sneeze."}
{"text":"Heard about this and now I got a chance to try it out. First I would like to say this is an awesome place. The sandwiches is so so awesome. I order three types of sandwich so I could try them all out. The Monty, BLT and the wild bore. Each sandwich has it own excellent taste. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. A must try place if you love bacon!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! If you can find a better bacon and egg buttie good luck ! And let me know!
PS. Had the full Monty"}
{"text":"Omg. Bacon heaven right here. And when I say bacon heaven I totally mean it. A lot of places will offer bacon options without really caring about what kind of bacon it is - they think bacon as a word is enough to satisfy people. But Rashers delivers perfectly crispy on the edges and fatty luscious melt in your mouth meat on the inside beautiful bacon. And then they put it between delicious bread with perfectly harmonious toppings and charge you a reasonable price for it. 
Visit this place before it's too late - because I'm going to move in on their front step and eat everything before you get there."}
{"text":"You will not find a better place for a bacon sandwich. So many varieties of bacon, paired with many other ingredients and a great range of breads. My favourite is the British bacon butty with an egg in a bun - fantastic. 

You will smell of bacon upon leaving but what do you expect?"}
{"text":"I'm new to Toronto and I'll be honest, I haven't been the biggest fan of this whole peameal bacon thing Toronto's got going on. 

That is until I tried Rashers' Hog Town sandwich. The bacon was crisp and plentiful and the brown sauce was awesome. I wasn't hungry for hours after, trust me, this is a feat.

Now that I have a taste Toronto bacon, I know I'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious!  Such great options and there are vegetarian versions as well!  Everyone enjoyed their breakfast, only down side was it was a little more expensive than your average breakfast sandwich but these are not your average breakfast sandwich either!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I have enjoyed all of the sandwiches offered, and am happy to order the special sandwiches when they are made available. Breakfast, lunch, and the occasional dinner; whenever. Try the vegetarian sandwich but add bacon, deelish.

What I do not like, is planning my morning around stopping by there for breakfast, say around 8:15am, and them not being open. Once or twice, fine. But 6-10 times is enough to leave a really sour taste in your mouth. Just post 830 as your opening time instead of 8am, and this problem is avoided. Better yet, open at 7am to get people on their way to work."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite. The food is ridiiiiiculous (I highly recommend some form of the bacon on a bun with caramelized onions and beer mayonnaise). The staff is funny and fast. Can't recommend highly enough!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband & mom and we each had something different. The bacon on my sliders was perfectly cooked and the brown sauce is to die for! Mom had the wild boar sandwich and it was huge, I hovered thinking she'd never finish it and I would get a taste, but not a chance, she ate every morsel and loved it. My husband had the classic Hog town sandwich and said it was awesome. Looks like I've found a new gem!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday late lunch. Had the full monty and it was amazing.

They know how to make a mean bacon sandwich."}
{"text":"Rashers is just glorious.

There's not much more to say. 

Whether your favourite type of bacon is peameal, streaky, British, or even vegetarian (!), you'll find it in Rashers, slapped in copious amounts onto a thick sandwich with a delightful array of toppings and condiments.

Brilliant. 

The portions will keep you stuffed all day, and the staff are lovely and will gladly make any changes or customisations to your order.

GO HERE.

(Just make sure, as per my app tip, that you give your sandwich time to cool down before eating it. These guys cook their food well, and I find eating it too soon after preparation ruins the flavour a bit, as it's so hot it's hard to taste anything. Not sure if that makes any culinary sense, but I prefer eating my Rashers 10-15 minutes after getting them :) )"}
{"text":"First time there today...had the grilled cheese sandwich (with bacon of course)...I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing British bacon sandwich (think Canadian + american bacon all in one). Got a parking ticket while I was waiting - couldn't care less. Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Yes! MORE PLEASE!

Ever since visiting Rashers a couple weekends ago, I've probably thought about them more than I've thought about my family (I hope they don't read this - I love you, family). I frequently catch myself reliving the rich flavour of bacon, maple, cheese, butter and bread in my mouth... it's pretty magical how it has made such a lasting impression on my tastebuds, because, have YOU ever heard of DEJA-NOM??? I can only think of a few *other* things that I will never forget the taste of (cue imaginations everywhere running wild) - including sriracha, sand/dirt, hangover breath and oysters. 

Friendly service and hassle free menu. Sit in front of the store in their school chairs and make passersby jealous with your very own Rashers sammich!

Atmosphere - it's a small take out joint with 3 stools.
Service - 5/5
Food - 5/5
Price - 5/5"}
{"text":"I went there while i was visiting Toronto. The breakfast sandwich was excellent! The guys know their bacon."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering the Winter Warmer... It was too much in one sandwich. But I'm giving a 5 star rating because my boyfriends Hogtown sandwich was amazing. Definitely what I'll order next time. The service was good and the prices were very fair."}
{"text":"So never tied rashers and they popped up on my foodora app that I used once and only once. I ordered a couple of sandwiches from them through foodora and they never received, accepted nor delivered my order. I called the restaurant and it sounded like they did not know how to use the app and confirmed that the order was not there. After checking with foodora and having my order refunded I tried sending an email to rashers to let them know that I will not order from this restaurant while tied to a useless company like foodora and their email came back as no one tied to that email. This experience has taught me that restaurants in Leslieville have a long way to go in understanding customer service that leads to repeat business.

Update: After posting this review the owner contacted me to tell me that he will make it right Monday by contacting foodora. But what he failed to understand is that while foodora is to blame for this cockup he failed to do anything and everything to deliver me food. If the delivery service he chose failed to deliver it would have been  impressive for him to have asked what I ordered and delivered it himself. But all he came up were excuses. Moving on as Toronto has better more reliable places to eat.

Update 2: After two days I received a text at work to tell me that my food order from Rashers was here.  Funny, I thought I cancelled it two days ago and my order definitely is not at work.  They even delivered it to the wrong address.  Incompetence, the only word to describe this whole mess!

Update 3: Food was delivered because Foodora missed the boat.  So we decided to eat up the now cold sandwiches and taste food we literally did not wait for.  For the price I found it underwhelming.  I had the Butty which looked flat between two plain white slices of bread.  Taste was okay but I could hardly taste the Ham.  The Bacon Grilled cheese was okay too, better than the Butty but it still lacked a certain something.  Both sandwiches could do with some color, maybe some veggies, and make the sandwiches look a little more like what you see online. But hey, I have beaten a dead horse and the meal was free!  But the one star is about what I would give."}
{"text":"I have been trying to limit my gluten intake for the past several months but every once in a while I break down.Its not for any alergic reasons...Im just trying to be trendy....I thought today was going to be that day...After walking past Rashers all month and seeing that sweet bacon...I caved...i was hung over....and ready to make some bad decisioins!  Or was I?  

I swung open the door to this little pork kingdom and was greeted by both the crew behind the counter Immediatly (hard to not have that kind of greeting I suppose, as this baconery is quite petite), As hungover and emotional people do...I immediatly confessed my desire to sin and asked for any guidence they may be able to give to this poor weak soul.  

Instead off 3 Our Fathers and 2 Hail Mairy's I was delivered somthing extrordinary as my penance!  The Hog Town with a medium fried egg and cheese....on GLUTEN FREE BREAD!!!!  With a heftly supply of Peameal and a perrfectly cooked egg smothered in cheese and house made brown sauce now in my belly, I was ready to take on the world!  Or go back to bed...I chose the latter.....

Thanks for keeping me in line during a moment of weakness my Bacon Buddies!"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich to-go and, to be fair, it took me a while to get home, but the bun had gotten completely soggy and the sandwich fell apart. It felt like there was too much bacon. I know! I didn't think such a thing possible, but there you have it. I might give it another shot when I know I can eat right away."}
{"text":"My hubby and I wandered in here when we were in the neighbourhood and we were not disappointed.  I had the full monty and my hubby had the beer BLT, both sandwiches were really good and we can't wait for our next visit, this place is great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I won gift certificates for here through an auction for a dog rescue to raise funds for them. I went to go pick them up at the store and I had a hell of a night the night before and I needed some grease. I ordered the classic grilled cheese, boy did it not disappoint. It was quite possibly the best grilled cheese I've ever had. Huge slice of bread with really old aged cheddar, bacon, ale mustard and maybe some onions?? It was ahhhhh-mazing!!!! Right combo of salty, spicy from the mustard, the strong taste of the cheddar. I'm so happy I won these gift certificates, even happier I still have another $20 left to spend there."}
{"text":"As I'm in the Dundas & Ossington area frequently for business, one thing that makes me happy is the massive variety of restaurants in the region to satisfy my palate. 

I have looked in the window of Rashers many times, and the other day decided to finally sample their cuisine. (It also was recommended by a friend) 

The cashier was courteous, and prompt, and the my sandwich was delivered in a timely manner, all things that are essential to establishing return business.

For my first time here, I decided I would sample the  Bacon Caeser. Priced at 9$ I would say that it is average for a sandwich just about anywhere. 

I was delivered it as described on the menu, the amount of bacon was 'enough' . It was not skimped, nor piled. The bun was soft and warm. 

The sandwich satisfied my hunger, I was pleased. 

As there are about a dozen sandwiches to try, I will definitely return. 

I would suggest though, if you are looking for a meal, you should probably grab an order of spuds, as the sandwich alone likely won't be enough."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  There is nothing better on a weekend morning when you've maybe had a few too many the night before.  The staff are friendly, without being in your face and the bacon butty is amazing.  I've tried the Wild Boar and it's good too but love the basic with brown sauce.  Only downside is the bloody lines, what!"}
{"text":"I work a few blocks east of this location, and occasionally I'll do a Rashers run for my team for lunch.

The bacon really is top shelf stuff. Tasty and flavourful beyond the usual mmm bacon. I've had two of the different grilled cheeses, but our new favourite is the Caesar Salad bacon sandwich. It's fatty lunchy perfection."}
{"text":"The food was great. Bacon is (always) delicious. 
Great portions, and the fries are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Was downtown one day so I decided to try something new. This little sandwich shop in ossington serves only bacon! Who doesn't love bacon right lol? Actually i don't like bacon, but i really enjoyed my sandwich. We ordered the the bacon and Brie and also the BLT. The BLT was way too big for me in my opinion. The bacon and Brie was perfect ! I couldn't believe how much i enjoyed the bacon sandwich. It was shockingly delicious!

I also ordered a side of fries. They were alright. Nothing entirely special. The are having an anniversary celebration on Nov 25 where they are giving away sandwiches and selling them for $5 each too. I would go back to try this.

They also have lots of parking on the streets of ossington."}
{"text":"Just got the \"winter warmer\" sandwich. It was so good. Can't wait to try the whole menu, especially something with the \"English style\" bacon.
It's all takeout, with a few seats outside if you want to eat immediately."}
{"text":"Tried Hogtown Sanwich and Full Monty, both are GREAT!! Both taste awesome and definitely will go back.
This would have been a perfect place for lunch if they can have a better seating area.
(Current setting is more for take out food really.)"}
{"text":"Went on Friday at opening 8am. Teenage son had to be at school by 8:45,  got the full Monty and grilled cheese sandwich.  The bacon is sooo good

The full Monty has peameal and egg with hp sauce on brioche bun.  Teenage son loved it. A bit messy for me.  I just take a bite. Bonus having kids because my ticker doesn't work as good as theirs. 

Daughter has grilled bacon (regular cut). Not fatty at all. With Brie cheese and and onion marmalade jam.   Very buttery on outside. But loved my one bite.  

2 pops. Orange Fanta because milk and juice even at 8 am doesn't cut rug when needing a burp for this messy goodness.  

A once every 3 to 4 months thing, they will stick to yogurt and fruits any other day at home.  But certainly a treat breakie.  

Nice staff !  Attentive and efficient.   3 stools for eating and 3 old school, school chairs outside. 

$22.75.  Takes interac and cash."}
{"text":"I went to this place for breakfast, because I couldn't find anything else. I may not be the best person to review this since I'm not a big fan of burgers, especially not for breakfast. As expected (based on the burger signs and the clear love of bacon), the sandwich (more like a burger) was very greasy. In my opinion, overwhelmingly greasy for a breakfast. I took the most popular sauce, which was mustard-based, and I felt it didn't match the egg and flavors at all. The service was quite fast, the waitress was helpful, the meal was cheap. Unfortunately, I didn't like it. Maybe it would be a better suited place for lunch."}
{"text":"Thank God for Rasher's and all its greasy glory.

I'm not usually a fan of bacon (blasphemy, I know) but I never bacon could taste so goddamn good in the right combo. The Apple Maple Bacon Grilled cheese. The apple just goes so well with bacon. It's perfect amount of sweet juiciness and smoky flavor. 

I had a bite of my friend's Wild Boar and the addition of blue cheese is just amazing.

Only downside is that yes, it's a bit of a greasy mess but it is a delicious greasy mess. 

What was surprising though was how good the roasted potato wedges were. I wasn't expecting much because its just a side but wow, perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not too salty, not too plain, not too much paprika. One of the staff also suggested ranch with the wedges but I thought they were good enough on their own.

Last but not least, I happened to be with a group who consisted of a few with dietary restrictions. One vegetarian and one with gluten allergies. They do have an eggplant bacon which apparently is amazing as well and Rasher's does have gluten-free options as well. Hooray for Rasher's!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon grilled cheese and asked for no additional butter or oil. It's was quite expensive at over $10 for just mozzarella. When the sandwich came out it was SOAKED in grease. The bread was practically translucent. Staff are perfectly nice but not worth the money just to eat straight oil/butter. I ate half but threw the rest out. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Kind of a lot smaller than I thought it would be, better off eating outside. Good selection of sandwiches with a very generous helping of swine goodness (BACON), what else. Disappointed though, no defib upon leaving! Oh! make sure before you start eating wrap napkins around bottom of sandwich wrapper, juices will find a way out and give your clothes a taste of what the mouth is savouring."}
{"text":"Just had the Brie & Bacon sandwich from Rashers and it just made my day. The sandwich was nice and warm as advertised and every bite was filled with bacon, caramelized onions, and ooey gooey brie. I can't wait to try some of their other delicious bacon offerings."}
{"text":"The simplicity and range of bacon is what makes this place standout, perfect for breakfast on the go. Bonus points for the option of British/Australian rashes, that's a big deal for any expat."}
{"text":"It certainly hits the spot, especially as a hungover morning greasy treat. The wait time was a bit disappointing, and while the sandwich itself is delicious, it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Not for me. I had the hog town and added egg and cheese, total price $11.50 ish. Without the cheese and egg it would have been just bacon.  I found it pricy for what it was. Very salty and not tasty. The service was excellent, beyond polite and they were very helpful. I hope these guys do well but it will be without me. Just not healthy good value."}
{"text":"I like this place 100%. When what you want is a meat fix this is the ticket. You definitely get your bang for your buck Here with the amount of meat you get on the bun. Perfect for a grab and go bite on your way dt or trinity Bellwoods"}
{"text":"I will be honest, I totally dig the pig and this place is like the mother ship calling me home.

Place is small, four spots inside but mainly best for pick up and go.

Service is fantasitc.  Two cooks and someone to take our order.  On an iPad!  gotta love when places use technology.

What did i have?  I successfully convinced a buddy to order the apple maple grilled cheese, while i had the beer BLT - and then we split it.  HOLY foodgasm.  It was amazing.  I couldn't finish either...and yet i still have a food baby to show for it.  Actually, it might be twins...but i digress.

The potato wedges were also delish.  I had them sprinkled with paprika.

Run, don't walk to this place.  You will not be disappointed.

P.S. make sure to get an \"i heart bacon\" pin  at the counter!"}
{"text":"The Full Monty.  Bacon with tomato and mushrooms and an egg cooked the way you like, smothered in some kind of tasty brown sauce.  

Great breakfast or afternoon snack."}
{"text":"This plAce has wonderful sandwiches and treats! It's very filling and delicious.  It's the tiniest little shop along queen, but they do have window seats. Perfect for a quick bite when on the run or to grab and go on streetcar. It's the perfect hunger fix."}
{"text":"Love at first bite! I love Canadian bacon but was really missing the bacon from my home country. When I discovered that Rashers had British style bacon, I couldn't get there quick enough.
I had the toasted bacon butty with fried egg and BBQ sauce (they even asked me how I liked my egg cooked. Over easy) and my friend had the bacon sliders with a side of the herbed potato wedges. Loved every bite and my friend was happy with hers, too. The smile on my face said it all!"}
{"text":"I came across this gem last weekend when I was looking at some of the local open houses.  I was walking down Queen St and in the distance I saw a sign that said bacon.  I started walking towards it, not taking my eyes off of the sign.  As I was getting closer the smell of bacon was in the air.
I opened the door it felt like I was in heaven, the sound and smell of bacon and eggs filled the room.  I walked up to the counter and looked at the menu.  There are around 9 different sandwiches to choose from, even a veggie option for you non meat eaters out there.  You can customize each sandwich by adding eggs, cheese and different sauces on top.  On Sat I decided to order the Bacon Butty with a fried egg on it.  Unfortunately I didn't have my camera with me to take some pics of it but I knew I would be back again.

So that brings us to this morning, I knew I wanted to go back to Rashers so I grabbed my camera and walked down Queen St. just west of Carlaw.  I talked to Colin (the man behind the counter) and asked him what the most popular sandwich was and he replied with a smile on his face \"definitely the Hogtown Sandwich\".  He explained to me what it was so I took his advice and ordered it with a fried egg and cheese on top.  This beast of a sandwich comes with 4 pieces of peameal bacon on a bun with homemade brown sauce, and like I said before you can add an egg and cheese.  You should be prepared that you need to be really hungry for this one.  This sandwich was so good, the gooey cheese with the salty peameal bacon, the fried egg dripping all over the soft bun and a nice sauce to top it all off.  It was delicious.

Rashers is a bit of a small place so there are only 5-6 seats to sit down at.  I was lucky enough that some people were just leaving so I got to sit down.  The first thing I noticed was this poster of Bacon Facts on the wall  There are some very interesting facts, some I believe and some I don't, but anyways it's a nice touch.  Take a look for yourself and tell me what you think.  The next thing I noticed on a wall was a portrait of Kevin Bacon, you know from the hit movie Tremors and many other award winning films.  I actually laughed out loud, because it's not a typical portrait, he's dressed up like renaissance man from the 1500?s.
Rashers might be a bit tight but that's ok, you don't need to be there for long, you eat and go.  It's a place where you stop by for a quick bite and you continue on with your day.

{"text":"I had to be sure to come to Yelp and tell everyone how awesome this place is. Their sandwiches are super tasty. I've been with a few friends and have tried almost all the sandwiches except the Wild Boar and vegetarian (that one won't happen). Yes the place is small, but I've always been able to have a seat and eat, and i'm a fan of  \"whole in the wall\" type places so the size is just fine for me. I've always had friendly staff and great service. 

If you appreciate the art of bacon and can afford a few extra calories for breakfast, lunch or dinner, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us came in this past Thursday from Chicago on our way to Montreal for Forumla 1. I had to tell you guys how impressed I was with Rashers. The dining in experience, service, and food quality was top notch! One of the best experiences I had on my road trip. I will totally recommend Rasher and will make a point of returning! Thanks for a great memory!!"}
{"text":"we found rashers completely by accident!
the flat we rented was nearby so we decided to walk around and check out the hood.
we saw a sign that read \"bacon sandwiches\".
i mean, who doesn't like a bacon sandwich!?
when we got closer, we saw that it was a peameal sandwich place.
prior to our trip, we had already decided that we had to try this hogtown favorite.
we just weren't exactly sure where until we stumbled upon rashers.

it's a small place with a few booths and a counter to place your order.
behind the counter is where they make the food.
there's also an entire wall of bacon graffiti.
pretty cool.

we ordered three sandwiches but my favorite was the hogtown.
it's the original peameal sandwich, with a fried egg, on a nice brioche style bun, and slathered with that ale mustard.  
just yum!!!

it was so good, we went again before leaving toronto.
thanks, rashers, for making my first peameal sandwich experience a great one!"}
{"text":"It's a very small place, just enough room to order and wait, a little space to eat at wooden counter if the place isn't busy.

I had a Hogtown and wedges. The wedges were nice, above average, but not exceptional. The Hogtown was a solid peameal bacon sandwich, which I had with cheese and brown sauce, and enjoyed. Reminded me a fair amount of the St. Lawrence Market pemeal sandwich.

I'd have to try a few more choices to get a better sense for the place, but I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love these hammy sammies. Recently a friend was visiting from Tennessee and he was looking to see and experience all the things Toronto was famous for. He had read in a history of Christianity that Toronto was once known as the Methodist Rome. I am not religious myself and had no idea that TO had that claim to fame. And being a recent immigrant to the four-one-six myself, I strained to think if I could suggest anything as cool as that. Then we got talking food and my friend started going on about the trend in local ham that was going on down south in TN. Then it hit me, the thing that I always went for anytime I visited Toronto was Peameal Bacon. AND this now bustling metropolis was once known as HOGTOWN! So we dragged our southern buddy to Rashers and he was transformed. These folks make a hell-of-a tasty bacon sandwich. And they seem to take care in making them. Later that trip we stopped by some of those Methodist churches but I got the feeling that those bacon sandwiches were what was on my friend's mind when he flew out and not Methodism so much."}
{"text":"Ordered rashers delivery off of one of Toronto's many food apps. The burger was burnt to a crisp as if it was left on the grill and forgotten... and, the grilled cheese arrived soggy and had apple chunks and raisins in it. I've had grilled cheese with apple in it from a food truck, and the version at rashers was nothing like that at all. Very odd concoction. We had to throw both out. Too bad because I love bacon and wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Quite yummy; had the beery bacon sandwich with arugula on a tasty French baguette. Very high quality ingredients. Perfect sandwich. The grilled bacon n cheese was good but the strong cheese overpowered the bacon. I prefer bacon sans cheese. Would honestly like to be able to buy plain old bacon to snack on. With dip? Too much? With Paulette's fried foods across the street, this hood is getting dangerous. 

Small but cheap menu; no seating except some chairs out front (also a park across the street); quality ingredients; good and fast service. Will return."}
{"text":"The sandwich was ok. Nothing to really write home about. Portions are small. But what disappointed me was that the potato wedges where raw. I had a friend who went to the business the day before and he said the same thing about the wedges. It took some time too cook. The Lady behind the counter had no humour and seemed more worried about collecting my money then showing us customer service. Just a fast food pick up joint.  It's expensive for what you really get."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!

My boyfriend and I were in the area and we searched Yelp for a place to eat. We had no idea about Rashers, so we walked in and were pleasantly surprised.
It's very small and cozy, with only a couple bar stools for sitting by the window. We got the steak/bacon special to share and it was freakin' amazing! I'll definitely go back. 

It can get really crowded inside if you thinking of eating in... best to take out."}
{"text":"Where can you find a great bacon butty sandwich in Toronto? I'll tell you, but first, you may be wondering what a bacon butty sandwich is. Invented in England, it's a favourite sandwich among Brits consisting of white bread, bacon and brown sauce. You can find this unique dish and other delicious bacon sandwiches at the family-friendly diner, Rashers. 

Owner Richard Mulley is originally from England and is committed to making quality bacon sandwiches for his customers that are simple, yet delicious. Rashers, he says, is not about bacon being the hot new food trend. It's a casual restaurant where you can find premium local bacon of different cuts and varying flavours. I recently attended a dinner to sample some of Rashers' most popular creations at the newly opened Ossington location. The original location is in Leslieville and is a hit with locals.

British expats who are hungry for an authentic bacon butty ($8.00) will enjoy the classic sandwich that comes with homemade brown sauce and cheese or a fried egg may be added to it for a small charge. This one isn't reserved for just the expats; try this novelty for yourself! The brown sauce is tangy with a hint of spice and the meaty sandwich is quite filling. 

The bacon Caesar ($9.00) tastes much like you would imagine: crispy smoked strip bacon, fresh romaine lettuce with homemade Caesar dressing and grated parmesan cheese is served on a warm ciabatta bun. If you like a lot of crunch, this sammie is made for you. 

The fantastic brie and bacon ($10.00) is a crowd-pleaser. With smoked strip bacon, melted brie cheese and caramelized onions topped with a homemade garlic aioli on a toasted bun, this sandwich has a mix of both creamy and crunchy textures. The garlic aioli is not too overpowering and complements the sandwich very well. I also sample some delectably addictive hot and crispy garlic potato wedges ($4.00).

If you like your bacon cut thick, the Hogtown  ($9.00) is your go-to. The typical Canadian sandwich is a nod to one of Toronto's numerous nicknames and is comprised of peameal bacon with one-year aged cheddar and homemade ale mustard on multigrain bread that will keep you satiated.    

My absolute favourite sandwich of the night is the apple and maple grilled cheese ($9.50). It is loaded with cheese and is both sweet and savoury. The grilled sandwich comes with maple glazed smoked strip bacon, one-year aged cheddar and apple chutney on white bread that is bursting with flavour. 

Finally, Mulley offers the bacon burger ($11) to sample. The burger's patty has bacon mixed into it and comes with burger essentials, like lettuce, tomato and a signature chipotle mayo on a toasted bun. It's a substantial sandwich, so make sure you're hungry if you opt for this one.    

After sampling some of Mulley's unique creations, I can certainly say that you can find bacon sandwiches with high quality ingredients that are tasty and satisfying at Rashers. It's is a bacon lover's dream where you won't feel guilty pigging out!

{"text":"Stop # 2 Rasher...... an sandwich shop just at corner of queen and carlaw just across from Leslieville pumps which was stop #3 , I would think because of that this place probably see less business but given I was at both today I would say Rasher was better of the two but never were a bad sandwich

I had the hogtown sandwich, which was 3 piece of juicy peameal bacon with dijon mustard, there is an option to add cheese for a dollar which i did.between the peameal bacon and the cheese and mustard it was an unbelievable good sandwich.

Its very small through, little to no seating"}
{"text":"We've been to Rasher's several times and have been really impressed by the consistency. These people are sandwich building pros. One of us has tried and enjoyed the breakfast sandwich, but my go-to is the grilled cheese with peameal bacon (the Hogtown). It comes with the grainy mustard, but I ask for the home brown sauce on it as well. Sandwiches sometimes take a little bit of time to create, but it's worth the wait because all these things -- the bacon, eggs, the bread -- need to get a little greasy on the grill. And hot!

Rasher's is generous with the condiments -- you can have any combo of sauce on your sandwich, or get some on the side. One problem is that they don't have this list listed anywhere. (Who would know that the delicious brown sauce exists?)

Bathroom doors are cool and thematic -- meat locker style. Press the red knob to get out.

We went by a few times a few months back and were surprised to find it closed, and the hours weren't posted on the door. We were worried Rasher's had gone out of biz! Thankfully that's not the case, as we've eaten there since. But I didn't notice whether the hours are now posted (I hope so)... too focused on my yummy sangwich."}
{"text":"Great place for a bacon sandwich!  The food is hot and fresh, and certainly leaves a lasting impression. I just wish the place was closer to my house or on my route to work so I could grab one in the morning!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and bomb breakfast sandwiches. Had the Full Monty with brown sauce. It was delicious and would definitely come back. Just a heads up, this is more of a take out place as there's only like seating G with 4 stools by the window."}
{"text":"MMMMMM BACON. 

It's a small store, barely any seating area, expect to wait about 10 mins for your tasty creation of goodness between two slices of bread. 

The menu is simple. Peameal on a bun, or thin British bacon with HP sauce on a toasty buttered sandwich bread (don't knock it, it's quite good). You can also add variation by adding a fried egg (any way you'd like) or cheese etc. I got a simple bacon butty, although really good, would have been better with a fried egg and cheese.

These guys are open at 730am, so perfect to pick up a breakfast sandwich, but also have the choice of LP across the street. Decisions, decisions. 

They also have a wild board sandwich, which is usually sold out unless you find the perfect moment to be there. They said usually thursdays. 

For a really filling meal, get a combo - $10 for sandwich, potato wedges and a drink. 
Potatos were good, but bland comparing to the flavourful smoked bacon you just ate. 
It also wasn't crunchy enough. 

Definitely a contender for best sammiches at Queen and Carlaw."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked bacon sandwiches with a nice variety of toppings.
We had the bacon Caesar and bacon Brie. I enjoyed the brie one a bit more as the bun was smaller so it seemed there was more bacon. The key to their success is 5 nice slices of strip bacon, pressed for consistent chewy goodness.. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the rasher sandwich but they ran out, had the hogtown with cheese and a fried egg.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy!

The service was friendly, and I will definitely be back.

The cashier was really hot in the sorta punk emo way, and very nice"}
{"text":"Finally someone who can make a bacon sandwich that is better than mine."}
{"text":"I was in the Leslieville area and I had been meaning to try Rashers after reading some really great reviews on Yelp and I'm always curious to see if a place really warrants great reviews.

I decided to order \"The Winter Warmer\" ($8.50 plus tax) which is a peameal bacon sandwich with sauteed onions, sundried tomatoes,mushrooms & spinach topped with 1 year aged cheddar & Sriracha sauce on a bun.  I also ordered a side of potato wedges topped with smoked paprika ($3.50 plus tax). The sandwich was amazing, cooked to perfection, the peameal bacon was tender, juicy and it worked perfectly with all the toppings that came with the sandwich. In my opinion the sandwich was better than the peameal bacon sandwich at the more renowned Carousel Bakery at St.Lawrence Market. The fries were good but not great, the fries are fresh cut and seasoned with smoked paprika but I preferred the fries to be a little bit more crispier.

If your looking for an amazing bacon sandwich at a reasonable price (keep in mind that the pork they use is organic and locally sourced which is normally more expensive) and want to support a small local business then you definitely have to try Rashers."}
{"text":"Restaurants like Rashers always have me praying to the gluten gods that bread didn't make me a whiny, snivelling, unhappy mess.  When I eat bread, it's a decision to not feel my best.  Dare I say that Rashers was worth it?

We went on a Sunday, about an hour before closing.  I don't know what it's like on a busy Saturday afternoon, but our food had to be made from scratch and took about 10 minutes.  This isn't a complaint.  Getting a fresh, hot-off-the-grill sandwich was worth it, and I enjoyed the wait as the smells of bacon and garlic hit the air and subsequently my nostrils.

I opted for the bacon caesar sandwich, served on a crisp ciabatta bun.  At the suggestion of the cashier/chef I added a fried egg.  The sandwich was incredible and the fried egg elevated it to more than just a sandwich.  It was an experience.

The location is great, and while there isn't a lot of room to sit down and eat, you could easily take your meal to nearby Jimmie Simpson Park and enjoy a cozy picnic with your delicious, bacon-y masterpiece of a sandwich.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty damn amazing sandwich! I was just visiting Toronto and staying in the area, and the first time I came down was just by following yelp for breakfast leads - and I was not disappointed.  The Full Monty totally hit the spot - it's a beautiful fluffy bun, bacon (of course), egg your way, mushrooms and tomato and this sour-ish gravy.  AMAZING.

The second time was the very next morning! I just had to have it again!!

If I lived here I'd probably get really fat on these sandwiches and would want to try every single one!

It's just a hole in the wall with almost no seating (there were two stools), and it gets warm in here in the summer - so you'll want to take your Sammy to go.  If only there was space for eating, I'd probably go for all 5 stars - but then again, you'd probably leave smelling of bacon (is that a bad thing though?)."}
{"text":"Ok I will confess one of the things that I truly miss from Ireland and the U.K. is a bacon butty.  There have been many pretenders over the years all across Canada.  Some even came close.  But they all left me wanting what I had in my childhood.  Today I found that bliss!
This is the best bacon butty that I have ever had in North America.  The bacon was superb, the bread was good and the brown sauce ok (it was good but I do miss Daddies Brown Sauce or Yorkshire Brown Sauce).
I recommend this place on food alone.
They have a few stools inside and 3 school desk/chair things outside.
The two lads that were working today were amazing.  They were good conversationalists.  They kept the pater going.
I will be back often.
My favourite fast food restaurant in Toronto now and it is reasonably near me in Leslieville!"}
{"text":"Was walking by and saw a man sitting out front eating what looked like a delicious sandwich.  Where'd you get that?  

Right here!

Went in and said I wanted their signature sandwich.

Back Bacon egg, tomato... I don't remember.  All I remember is being blown away at how good it was.

I mean mouthwatering.  

You pay a little more, but when the wave of bacon-gasms passes through, you will see where your money went. 

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"In summary, this place offers super-charged bacon sandwiches.  They've got a lot of choice on their menu to suit all types of people.  

I went for the The Full Monty which was stuffed full of British style bacon, fried tomatoes, fried egg, fried mushrooms, and homemade brown sauce, that's right, BROWN sauce.

Everything was made fresh at the griddle right behind us and I think it is worth the wait.  I always have an appreciation for those that can cook fresh and fast.

The sandwich was great and everything was done as it should have been.  Egg was nice and runny, mushrooms weren't too watery, and the bacon was nice and crisp.

I suggest you go to the nearby park and just savour the flavours on the picnic bench. :-)"}
{"text":"Crazy delicious but still found it to be quite expensive for just a sandwich.

They are NOT stingy with the bacon though. Had the bacon and brie and it was to die for... but it was over 11 bucks. Would recommend, but would be hard on the wallet if you get addicted to it, so be careful!"}
{"text":"It's hard not to love a restaurant committed to serving up high-quality and different cuts of bacon.  The smell that permeates inside Rashers made me salivate!  Granted, it's a teeeeeny take-out joint, so it's not hard for smells to permeate.  

Rashers is a bacon sandwich shop.  They several different types of bacon sandwiches as well as a veggie sandwich and potato wedges.  

I tried the BLT sandwich, which was excellent and a good size.  It wasn't cheap at $8.50, but wasn't overly pricey either.  The BLT has several strips of well-executed bacon (don't know the variety) topped with arugula (I believe) and fresh tomatoes, all served on a delicious baguette.   It comes with a mayo that I had on the side.  When I tasted it with my fingers (to determine if it met my tastiness-per-calorie threshold), I found it really bland so I left it off.  The sandwich was delicious without the mayo, so I saved a couple calories, which I plan to re-invest in more Rashers/bacon! 

Service was pleasant and fast.  The space is pleasant and clean.   There is come bar seating and some old-school classroom seating out front.  

A great first experience - I look forward to 'pigging' out here again!"}
{"text":"My name is Siobhán and I am a bacon-obsessed former vegan.

Had to fly into town for a quick business trip and I booked my AirBnB specifically because it was next door to Rashers. Came for breakfast and mid-order caught the \"substitutions encouraged\" so I requested the apple chutney aged cheddar grilled cheese be prepared with a fried egg on that sucker. Within a few bites the raging hangover I was white-knuckling through disappeared and my suspicions were confirmed: Bacon is magic."}
{"text":"Bacon lovers rejoice, for we have found salvation.
I'll admit that since I started to date a girl who doesn't eat pork, my bacon game has fallen off. But luckily along came a casual stroll down Ossington all by my lonesome, when a craving came upon me and Rashers was along my footpath. 

Your options here are strictly bacon related options, but includes a variety of bacon types from standard strip to peameal to british cut, and they've got almost a dozen different bacon sandwiches to choose from. 

I had the Bacon & Brie sandwich, complete with caramelized onions and garlic mayo on a soft and warm bun. It was $10 + tax and worth every penny. The sandwich was filling and they didn't skimp on the brie. 

After eating here, I'll be thinking of more random excuses to walk by this place and stop by for my bacon quotas."}
{"text":"This small place for bacon sandwiches is AWESOME.  So yummy..

it's very very small.  4 stools at the window.  Don't expect to have a nice sit down menu."}
{"text":"If you like bacon...it's heaven. The variety of creative options make return visits worthwhile. Quick friendly service. Not much space for dining in."}
{"text":"What's not to like about a restaurant with a menu centered around bacon?!  

My friend and I hit this place up on a Saturday morning, on our way to check out the jazzfest.  I had the bacon sliders and my friend had a toasted bacon/egg sandwich thingy,  I'm pretty sure she liked it, but I wasn't paying attention...I was too focused on devouring my sliders and the garlic/herbed potato wedges that I ordered.  

This place is tiny, but who cares, they serve BACON!  Prices are good, location is good...blah, blah, blah...BACON!"}
{"text":"YUM! Come with an appetite for some real bacon meals! Rashers is the only place serving thick cut peameal (back bacon) sandwiches and doing it right. The hog town sandwich is stacked with 4-5 pieces of peameal, a fried egg, aged cheddar and some fancy mustard between a really fluffy, brioche-like bun. Super satisfying and the concept is just executed perfectly. Now this is also not the only thing they serve. They have breakfast boxes which include British bacon, eggs, toast, beans and brown sauce, bacon grilled cheese, BLTs and much more. I have to slowly work through this menu so I don't get cardiac arrest but I really look forward to trying the breakfast box! 
I would like to note the insane service I received from Nicolette as well! She single handedly ran the shop (in person orders, Uber eats, skip the dishes - orders, preparing the line, working a full flat top grill). She knew I was in a rush and really worked it on top of all the action to ensure I didn't wait too long!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try out this place, and I am so glad I did! 

Def recommend takeout because a)it is a small place (four people max. A bar and stools) b) you and your clothes will smell like bacon for the entire day. 
I like how they have a simple menu which means they can really focus on each component of a sandwich and use fresh ingredients.Their sandwiches may not look the most impressive, but each bite will make you want to have more. Simply delicious and well-executed!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, filling and well priced. Fun and friendly staff. A great, quick alternative to lining up for brunch in Leslieville. 

I order off-menu: peameal bacon, fried egg, cheese, beer mayo on a focaccia. $10 tax in and enough that I am not eating again until supper."}
{"text":"After passing this place for months and seeing the \"opening soon\" signs, I was excited to see that it finally opened this week.

I thought to myself - I should support the local business.  It appears that others had the same idea, as they had steady traffic going in and out.  I think they were so busy that they ran out of bacon a short while later!  Oh the horror!

I couldn't get my girlfriend to try it with me.  She wasn't up for a bacon sandwich today.  With a name like Rashers, they're pretty up front about what you're getting.  They do have a vegetarian option on the menu - I'm sure we'll try it at some point.

I'll start with the ordering process.  Orders were taken on an iPad connected to a terminal.  While this had a modern feel, it looked like they were still getting used to the system.  No big deal, as the ordering process was relatively quick.  

I ordered the Hogtown Sandwich.  It's basically peameal bacon on a Kaiser.  I added a Fried Egg, Cheese, and Brown Sauce.  The total was $8.92 after tax, which included $1.25 for the Egg and Cheese.  My only basis for comparison are the breakfast sandwiches that they sell at St. Lawrence Market.  The Rashers sandwiches are a couple of dollars more expensive, but they are made fresh, too.

The proprietor said that my order would take a few minutes.  I wondered if I would be in for a long wait, and asked how long it would be.  He said about five minutes, and that's about how long it took.  A good sign!

As for the sandwich itself?  It reminded me of the sandwiches that my (Scottish) mom used to make for breakfast when I was young.  The peameal was cooked about right.  The fried egg was fully cooked.  I'm not sure if I could get it runny if I wanted, but I imagine so.  I'm not sure if the brown sauce was standard HP sauce or something else.  The overall combination was delicious.

Looking at the menu, I get the impression that these guys had British parents, too.  It's a variety of bacon sandwiches in different combinations.  

I went back and forth between giving them 4 stars and 5 stars.  I'll visit again to see how consistent they are and to see if their other menu items are good.  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because they just opened, and the sandwich that I had was still solid.  Normally, restaurants have a lot of kinks to work out early on, but they executed well on this visit.

I've linked to their website, but it doesn't appear to be finished yet.  Also, I couldn't see their hours of operation posted anywhere.  Hopefully they get those both taken care of soon.

Generally, I'm happy that there is now a place in the neighbourhood where I can grab something quick to go.  There are many great restaurants in the area, but not many where you can pick up something quickly and eat on the run.  This fills that void.  A welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"If you like bacon and you see a sign that specifies bacon as being it's \"thing\" , you immediately must enter... you think a junkie passes past a flop house and thinks to himself....\"naaaa... i'll pass on that now\"... NO... You go right in and get your \"fix\" of bacon amazingness. Rasher's sells bacon on various types of bread with various types of toppings, the price is extremely reasonable. The breakfast bacon on a bun with fried egg and cheese is only 6 bucks! If you need a side there's perfectly crunchy and fluffy in the middle potato wedges, with a selection of house made sauces. The man working there won't hesitate to make suggestions for you and is way helpful. I literally find nothing wrong with this place for what it is..FIVE STARS FOR YOU. Now the rest of you people need to get there and eat it..... lucky you!"}
{"text":"Not as good as expected from my previous visits to their Queen East location.  The portions of bacon seemed smaller which changed the overall taste of the sandwiches.  The potato wedges were fresh and hot but seasoning was way off.  We ordered them with garlic seasoning but there was no garlic flavor instead it had some paprika flavor. We thought it was a mistake but we're assured that it was not (strange).  The cook later admitted that the seasoning mix might be off. I will go again but will try their breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious. It can be slow if there is a line (everything is made fresh to order) - so go get a coffee from the Mercury."}
{"text":"I loveee bacon, and I gotta say, Rashers did a good job making them. First of all, the store itself smells like bacon deliciousness. Definitely gets that appetite going once you step into the shop. Their staff is also very pleasant. We got the brie and bacon sandwich, bacon caesar sandwich and curly fries. Boy that was good! We were stuffed by the time we finished everything. They also do ubereats so if you don't have time to drop by, you can certainly order online. Definitely recommend this shop!"}
{"text":"Just tried Rashers for the first time and very happy with my lunch. Best parts: clean preparation, huge portions, friendly service, and a great combo deal (sandwich, wedges and drink). Wedges are a little soggy but thats because they are not deep fried though that's ok. Right now they have a promo where if you run or bike in the shape of a pig, you get a discount. Only two people have taken advantage so far!  With the bacon menu, might not show up daily but it's a great treat and definitely an asset to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We come here semi frequently.  I'm probably the only person who consistently orders their vegetarian option.  I did also try one of their grilled cheese sandwiches with some apple topping and of course, some bacon.   They are pretty quick, and the sandwiches are tasty.

I'm pretty happy this place is close by.  They have a variety of bacon-y goodness filled treats.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"came out to the east end to grab some detroit deep dish pizza, but it was closed, so I decided to drop by Rashers. I think I caught them on an off day because it was a bit of a sh** show inside. seems like they were training a new employee, and it caused a bit of a backlog in the orders. also, the employees seemed to bicker at one in other in front of the customers. That doesn't bother me, but it took 45 mins to get a sandwich, which is excessive given what it is.

As for the sandiwch itself, I got the Full Monty which was tasty. The Brioche Bun is probably the highlight of the sandwich, and everything else in between is good, but not spectacular. I'd give this place another shot if I'm in the area, but i'm in no rush to be back."}
{"text":"This is what dreams are made of. If I could create the perfect fast food, this would be it. Their name perfectly describes their identity in one fancy word \"Rashers\" - thinly sliced bacon that is broiled.

Crispy, greasy, porky sandwiches that will satisfy even the harshest critic. Have it with apples, cheddar, tomatoes, mushrooms, brie or the kitchen sink. Have it with whatever you like and this stuff will taste heavenly.

To say this place is heaven does not do it justice. If you even remotely like the taste or smell of bacon then you owe it to yourself to stop by. This place is the holy grail and a bacon lover's sanctuary. 

Tip: Stay outside if you don't want to end up smelling like delicious bacon after your meal. LOL"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for bacon sandwiches. Home fries are good too. Go here and eat you will not be dissatisfied"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time just before Christmas for a late breakfast, following my dog Frankie's debut on the Marilyn Denis Show.

Love the originality of the concept, a restaurant devoted to everyone's favourite indulgence: bacon.

I had the Bacon Butty and hubby had the Hogtown Sandwich, both with egg and brown sauce. Both were drool-worthily delicious. Price point is the only thing that would keep me from making regular trips here, though I wouldn't say the price was by any means unreasonable. Hubs had another Hogtown from here today (wish he had ordered the Wild Boar, which has me intrigued...) and thought it was every bit as good as his first one.

Love the promo they have going on giving you 30% off your sandwich for running or biking a route shaped like a pig. Very clever."}
{"text":"Ok seriously, these guys put up a sign saying \"Back in ten minutes\" so I waited 15 for them to get back, and as soon as he gets back he tells me he's CLOSING now. Did I mention it was pouring rain? ...oh and that they close at 7 on Tuesday's and I went at 4:45."}
{"text":"Kudos for Rashers being all about bacon. If bacon is your thing, Rashers definitely has you covered.

I really enjoyed a peameal bacon sandwich here, but found the topping only added to the saltiness. While I realize bacon can be salty, I found this a bit too salty for 5 stars."}
{"text":"Try and dislike this place. Dare you. It's hard, unless you're vegan (though they do have a vegetarian option). My gluten intolerance isn't even enough to keep me away from this place. How can you go wrong with so much bacon? There's barely any place to sit here, but it doesn't matter because you get to leave with BACON SANDWICHES, and what's better than that? The Winter Warmer, which comes on a kaiser, has peameal bacon, sriracha, sun-dried tomatoes, provolone (I think), and some greens and it's unbelievable. Get two.

ACCESSIBILITY: Steps up to restaurant. No washroom."}
{"text":"The food is worth five stars. Hands down. The home fries are thick and chunky, and super-awesomely seaonsed, serving sizes are large, the bacon sandwiches!!!! oMG dreamy. 

The only down side for me was that the space is really only take out. Not that that's a bad thing, service is quite quick because of this, but because the food is sooooo good you want to eat it right away and the option of being able to sit down in a tad more space would be nice. 

Note- there is a couple bar stools facing queen street. But each time I went they were taken. 

Highly recommend the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Ca prend un peu de temps et il n'y a pas de tables, MAIS c'est super bon. Tout est préparé sur place et frais. Je recommande !!!"}
{"text":"This place has the bed pea mill bacon I ever tried. They have variety of bacon sandwiches and all are really good.  I know it's not good for me but it is soooo good for me. The cook is also so kind and passionate about his food. If you are Toronto don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Randomly found this on Yelp and had to try it.  Thank god I did.  It was so delicious.  Very nice man made it fresh to order.  It was piping hot and awesome.  Must go!!!"}
{"text":"The peameal bacon sandwiches I tried here were probably the best thing I ate in Toronto. Canadian bacon in the US is waaaaay different (not nearly as good, much drier) and the peameal bacon here was soft with a great springy texture and good rich porky flavor without being too salty. The buns they use too are a good chewy foil for the springy pork.

We tried the winter warmer which comes with some carmelized vegetables and sriracha as well as the classic egg/cheese/mustard version. I honestly don't know which one I'd recommend as both were excellent and I guess the question is how much do you want going on."}
{"text":"Delicious bacon sandwiches of the Hogtown, American, and British variety served with ur choice of sauce and toppings like fresh tomatoes! The winter warmer is a guiltless indulgence of peameal bacon topped with caramelized mushrooms, onions, sun dried tomatoes, real white cheddar, and crisp spinach! Incredibly balanced and delicious! I was completely satisfied as my hunger and bacon fixation were temporarily halted! They also have a delectable peameal bacon sandwich on a bun. You will be coming back for more of their high quality sandwiches. Super friendly customer service!"}

{"text":"I  had lunch today at Rashers.  I've walked by it lots of times but have never stopped in.

I ordered a bacon burger, with no lettuce.  It was a good burger and it was cooked-to-order.  The patty was tasty, the bun was soft and the chipotle mayo had a bit of a kick (I wish there'd been a bit more of the mayo on my burger, though).

The server and cook were friendly.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"3.5. Bacon everything. Bacon overload. 

From the moment you open the door, you know whats up. Its a tiny place and there is a haze of smokey bacon that just takes over. The first 5 seconds you get in, you think you're breathing in bacon and getting fatter just standing there. After a minute you become nose blind to it. 

Everything on the menu has some form of bacon in it, though there are some \"vegetarian options\". Got the winter warmer and it was pretty good, but very salty. The bun and toppings were great. Really wish i got the egg with it. Would've been a great (and gluttonous) breakfast sandwich. 

The staff there are very nice, especially the cashier. As i waited for my sandwich, there was a flow of regulars and the cashier knows them by name / order, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Rashers is so kick-ass good.  Maple. Bacon. Grilled cheese.  Those words just beckon me to order the same thing every time.  Luckily, the bf likes to order something different (though he does lean towards the butty mostly) so I have tasted several things on the menu.  And they are all satisfying and delicious. Service is friendly and efficient.  They make your order from scratch, so give them a break on the wait. I hope they can keep up their quality and stay in business forever."}
{"text":"Bacon, get the bacon burger with bacon and cheese, make sure you've dialed 91 on you friends phone. 
Awesome"}
{"text":"Look no further if you want a quick yummy bite of one of the best bacon sandwiches Toronto has to offer. Some booth seating is available, along with a long counter. There is another location on queen east as well. 

Most sandwiches are around the $10 mark, more if you have add-ons. Also check out their English breakfast fry-up as well, which is rumoured to be the most legit in the city.

4 different kinds of bacon are available - strip, peameal, British style and wild boar. Customizations are encouraged here, but I highly recommend giving their in-house brown sauce a try.

Taste wise, it's really hard not to like a good bacon sandwich, and this place definitely does a great job.

Overall, I am a fan!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood and looking for a lunch bite, and I'm so so glad I chose Rashers! 
A cozy little sandwich shop in lesliville, with a few stools at the bar, and fun bacon-themed posters and memorabilia on the walls for you to look at while waiting. 
The staff were so friendly and helpful in assisting my first time order, and I went with the winter warmer which had tender peameal, sautéed spinach onion and mushroom, with cheese and drizzled in sriracha. The food was piping hot, and the flavours blended perfectly in every bite. 
Forgive me if I say I crave this peameal sandwich a teeny bit more than even Carousel's in St Lawrence..!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with friendly staff... And lots of bacon! 
The food served here is worth the mess and grease you go through to inhale it. 
I wish there was more seating, but that's a minor issue."}
{"text":"Definitely will come back to try. A little pricey for it but I had the apple & maple bacon grilled cheese. 

The apple chutney was sweet and acidity helped to compliment the cheese and make it not as filling. A little pricey but will come back! Wanted the potatoes but they ran out. Shucks! Will come back for them as they sound delish.

P.S. the staff could have been a little more friendly though."}
{"text":"The bacon Brie sliders were awesome."}
{"text":"I went here today with my husband and friend and ordered their \"bacon in a bun\" with cheese and chipotle mayo. I have to say that everything was spot on and nothing was super salty nor bland. The bun was soft with crunchy exterior (fresh) and the generous amount of the bacon was superb! I am definitely sold and will become a regular patron! Keep up the bacon!!"}
{"text":"Literally dream about this place. Every time someone visits Toronto, I drag them here. I have tried a different sandwich every time I come here but have started to retry them. The apple chutney one is my favorite and works really well on a cold winter day. The Caesar salad sandwich is great on a hot summer day. The guys who work there are social and know a lot about  the cuts of bacon they are using. I would highly suggest stopping here for lunch on your way downtown!"}
{"text":"Bacon bacon bacon! 

It's the heaven of pork lovers!

However, the smell of bacon will be stuck with you whole day.....

I had the Brie and bacon.  I think the amount of bacon is good! The caramelized onion made it less greasy some how.

Bf had the bacon grilled cheese. It looked good but he said the sandwich is smaller in portion than my bacon bun.

Unfortunately this location doesn't have fries or coffee :("}
{"text":"Amazing bacon sandwiches! I used to go to the original location in Leslieville quite regularly as my husband is obsessed, and was so glad when this west-end location opened on Ossington near Dundas.  The Ossington location is bigger than the Leslieville one and has a lot more seating.  

I always get the Apple and Maple Grilled Cheese, which is what you'd get if an apple pie and a grilled cheese sandwich had a baby and swaddled it in bacon.  Rashers describes it as \"apple glazed smoked strip bacon with 1 year aged cheddar & apple chutney on white bread\".  Honestly, it's deelish!  

My husband has had everything on the menu and loves it all.  Every single person we've taken to Rashers loves their food...and seems to get hooked.  If you like bacon/sandwiches/food, you owe it to yourself to eat here!"}
{"text":"Great location first of all...
I didn't know what to order so I asked and they suggested the Butty which was English-style bacon...I'm not much of a fan of peameal and was a bit skeptical but ordered it anyway, with brown sauce(!?), cheese, and a runny sunny side up egg (that's the way I like it)...it came all wrapped up in tin foil...I was going to eat it in my car so I grabbed a bunch of napkins thinking it would be a messy thing, you know sometimes bacon is so chewy you pull it like an angry dog and then the bread falls apart and the egg completely falls out...but it wasn't!  Each bite was perfection!  English bacon is fantastic, it's got a great texture, it seems really lean but it has some crunch, and the brown sauce was slightly sweet and the egg made the whole thing sing. I wolfed it, I didn't even really need the napkin.

The sandwich was so good I want to marry it.  I really do."}
{"text":"Luckily the food is still good.  Not sure what happened to the service?  Different vibe for sure, not as good."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan.

I spotted this place by the 'Bacon' sign out front, so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, they were out of burgers at 4 in the afternoon, so I decided to give the Full Monty a try. What an amazing sandwich! I ordered mine with cheese and brown sauce - it's the only way to go, apparently.

Overall, the food was a 5, the experience was a 4 (it's a little small in the shop, and they were out of burgers, which is a significant portion of their menu). 

4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I think we can all agree that bacon should have its own food group.  There is no denying the fact that bacon tastes absolutely amazing, the smell of it makes you salivate and it really enhances every dish it touches.  If you're a bacon aficionado such as myself, you'll be happy to know that the Toronto restaurant, Rashers, has two locations in the city and deems themselves as the makers of quality bacon sandwiches!

The owner who hails from the UK wanted to introduce Canadians to the classic British sandwich he grew up eating otherwise known as the Bacon Butty. The butty consists of British-style rasher bacon served on white bread and topped with a homemade brown sauce. Rashers also serves up different cuts of bacon such as Canadian peameal, American strip bacon and British Rasher bacon and incorporates them in a variety of delectable sandwiches using an assortment of fresh breads.  

What I like most about Rashers is that they see bacon as a staple and not a trend.  They don't want to get fancy with bacon and add it to cupcakes or lollipops; they want to use it AS its intended purpose, to make sandwiches taste AMAZING.

The menu is short and sweet and is catergorized into the basics, the classics, something more and spuds. Every sandwich on the menu sparked my interest but of course there is only so much bacon you can eat in one day.  Here is what we tried at the food blogger event I attended:


Bacon Burger - Ground beef & bacon patty, smoked strip bacon, lettuce, tomato & homemade chipotle mayo on a toasted bun - $11

Bacon Caesar - Smoked strip bacon, romaine lettuce, homemade caesar dressing & grated parmesan on a warm ciabatta - $9

Brie & Bacon - Smoked strip bacon, brie, caramelized onions & homemade garlic aioli on a warm bum - $10

Hogtown - Peameal bacon, fried egg and homemade ale mustard - $8

Apple & Maple Grilled Cheese - Maple glazed smoked strip bacon, cheddar and apple chutney on white bread - $9.50

Bacon Butty - British style bacon, homemade brown sauce on white bread - $8

Handcut Wedges & Curly Fries - $4 each

I enjoyed all of the sandwiches I tried but if I had to pick my favourites it would be the Bacon Butty and the Apple & Maple Grilled Cheese.  The Butty is such a simple sandwich but it is unique in the sense that the style of bacon used is not readily available here in Canada.  The cut is essentially a loin roast with a bit of the belly attached.  It is full of flavour, tender and juicy and is piled high on white bread which absorbs the bacon juice and the delicious homemade brown sauce.  The Apple & Maple Grilled Cheese is the ideal sweet and salty sandwich. The homemade apple chutney paired with the cheddar and maple bacon is such a tasty combination. I liked that the chutney wasn't too mushy and still had a bit of chunky apple in it.

Overall I had a great experience at Rashers and love the fact that whenever I am craving bacon (which is always) I can pop into Rashers and indulge in quality, flavourful pork.  There are two locations in Toronto, one at 182 Ossington Ave and the other at 948 Queen St E."}
{"text":"Rasher's Hogtown Sandwich ($7.50) 

\"Tender pieces of peameal bacon on a warmed bun.
Delicious with a fried egg & 1 year aged cheddar. 
Described by Toronto Life as \"Toronto's iconic sandwich done right\"\" 

was a life changing sandwich for me. I never really like peameal before until NOW!

Thick slice of peameal so moist, so tender and with so much flavour
The bun from Ace Bakery so soft but with such a good bite
Whole grain mustard as condiment gave the sandwich that tangy taste and texture
Egg Fried to perfection 

Friendly staff

Now I even have craving for peameal?!

Need to go try other BACON sandiwch!  NOW!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. 
(updated review. If anything, I love this place even more.)

I love to try new things, hardly ever repeating a restaurant and yet I have been to rashers...  a lot. Just look at that checkins count! What are they putting in these sandwiches that is so addicting?! I'll look at my long list of new places to try, look at the boyfriend and say \"Bacon\" and he'll grab the keys. A weekend staple.

I have now had everything on the menu  (..multiple times.). My favourites happen to be the Hogtown, Bacon & Brie, Apple & Maple Grilled Cheese, and the Wild Boar. But order what sounds good to you! Guarantee you'll love it. Any sandwich will run you roughly $13 (once you tip their very nice staff) which isn't cheap on the sandwich scale, but they are defiantly not stingy when it comes to toppings. So you get what you pay for! These beauty's look like *I* made them, with extra everything.

All the bread is from Ace Bakery, which is fantastic because it tastes amazing and is delivered daily, so you know it's fresh. The buns they serve are wonderful at both holding up to the sandwich and soaking up all the wonderful bacon juices. The ciabatta has a hard crust and suits the sandwich it's served in; the white bread is very soft and makes a fantastic grilled cheese. Everything is well thought out. 

We have also had the potato wedges on multiple occasions, this being the only downside to Rashers. They are offered with either paprika or garlic, but these are often applied with a heavy hand. Once was an unbearable amount of paprika, but other times have been fine. These wedges are very soft and potato-y, I would like a better crust/crunch. I don't ever crave these, however The Boyfriend still likes them (but he has no limit on his love of potato). All 3 (!!) housemade mayos: beer, chipotle, and garlic are exceptional and mandatory for wedges. 

I only wish they were open late, as I would devour one of these after a couple drinks."}
{"text":"I went to Rashers on a whim and I am so glad I did. I had the apple & maple grilled cheese and it was absolutely delicious. Not to mention that the staff/cook was so friendly and wonderful to chat with. He asked if it was our first time and then made some suggestions. He told us not to worry as he would take care of us, and that he did! I will definitely be returning and I was so happy to learn that there is a second location closer to my home. 

*not to mention they have the best breaking bad reference for their service bell*"}
{"text":"Bumped into this place earlier because we took a wrong turn, but we weren't disappointed. Even though we were originally looking for a brunch spot, this sandwich exclusive establishment filled our cravings.

Service was excellent, the lady over the counter was extremely helpful in helping us choose our meal. She offered extremely helpful input on whatever we had to ask. Food came quickly and with a smile.

Ordered the apple & maple grilled cheese with a fried egg and a side of wedges. I realize now that I'm not a huge fan of combined sweet & savoury flavour, I like them separately, but it was still delicious! 

Environment was so cute! Very clean and bright, I loved it. Mood was happy and it kept me happy. They have signs in the booths where you can change up the letters, and we spent a whole 15 minutes writing our message.

All in all, I loved it! Would totally recommend. (Just make sure you're okay with getting messy)"}
{"text":"Walked by, and being a fan of bacon was intrigued. 

Big mistake.

Saw the menu, with prices of $9+, and thought I was in for a treat - clearly there were some serious sandwiches on offer.

Ordered the bacon grilled cheese. Got a standard grilled cheddar cheese on white with a couple of thin strips of grocery store bacon in it. I could get its equivalent in almost any greasy spoon in the city for a few dollars less on a platter filled with fries.

It was executed well, but only worth half the price - at most.

Total ripoff. I expect this joint to be out-of-business by the time I return to Toronto (at the end of October)."}
{"text":"It is sooooooooooooooooooo goooooooood here and especially in the winter. How amazing it is to sit inside from -40C snowy weather and enjoy a delicious burger and warm potatoes. I have been lucky to visit Rashers at the odd nobody-eats-at-this hour, so we sat down. Twice! It's really cold outside! Friendly service. Great homemade condiments as well.

Very flavourful!! Any choice is a good choice. It wasn't very very juicy like good burgers tend to be, and I do love juicy messy burgers. Rashers' are a bit drier because it's bacon! And delicious!! I think the price is extremely reasonable (cheap, in fact). I mean $8-10 a burger? Done! x2! +taxes!"}
{"text":"Best bacon sandwich hands down, it's a bit more money than the peameal bacon at St.Lawrence,  but this one is so much better. Yes the place is small, I can imagine in the summer what it's like. I had the English bacon sandwich, will go back and try some of the other ones."}
{"text":"I'm English. And if there is one thing I know it's a good bacon butty. 
When I saw the \"bacon butty\" on the menu advertising  British style bacon I had to try one.
Holy shit! It was good! 
This is the real deal. 
As an expat I've tried to not go for the \"British pub\" or \"British food\" places as here is more to experience and they often leave me a little angry as to how un-British they are. 
However, I often get the need to have a bacon butty and the bacon they sell in supermarkets here just doesn't  work well on bread. So I had to jump at this oppertunity. 
 The taste was so authentic took me back home to Manchester for a split second and I was left feeling whole again. 
I recommend this to anyone, especially homesick Britons and the hungover."}
