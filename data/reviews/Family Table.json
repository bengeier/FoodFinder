{"text":"A hidden gem on the edge of Rantoul.  Like Les said, don't let the outside fool you.  Walked in and the atmosphere was very nice, very professional, very home-y.  Great for families.  Menu was large and the service was good.  Food was VERY good and a GREAT price.  My wife and I spent about  $17 (including tax and tip).  Food comes in large volumes, too--we were stuffed!  An unbelievable deal--don't miss it!  We'll definitely go back a lot!"}
{"text":"flavor of food was good, but omelet was thin and dry,toast was super thin and came out burnt .coffee tasted like it was old . order also came out wrong."}
{"text":"Do not go here.  The food is actually not bad, once it finally comes.  I ordered All you can eat chicken.  It took a long time.  The owner brought it out and asked if I wanted more right away. I asked for 4 more pieces.  To my surprise she sent the waitress out to tell me I could only have 2 pieces!?  I asked is it not all you can eat.  The waitress apologized.  There was a lot of apologizing from her.  My wife ordered the cheese burger special.  It took 30 minutes!  My wife had to ask for her soup, then napkins, then lettuce and tomato.  Sorry, sorry, sorry is all we heard.  This place is for sure SORRY!"}
{"text":"Great biscuits and gravy. Nice atmosphere and great service. One of the only local places serving breakfast on Sunday!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, no taste to hamburgers. way too expensive for the quality of food. Unprofessional atmosphere. Got gift certificate from a friend don't want to use it, even though free food."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you ( it's in an old strip mall ) the decor inside is quite nice. This is a family restaurant with really good food and inexpensive. I've had the turkey and pork chops and they were great."}
{"text":"Food was alright but order had three mistakes.  Now it wouldn't normally have bothered me so much but we were the ONLY THREE in the restaurant.  The waitress was a very lovely soft spoken girl who did go back to the chief and get the order corrected. Hint get new menues the one you have were washed out and sticky"}
{"text":"This is why I hate small town diners. Lousy service from the get go. The owner's daughter & the hostess & pontificate. The waiters are overwhelmed on a Friday night & the old farts take forever to order and are maddeningly demanding. Place is depressing with its decor and is overwhelmingly too big. Decor is underwhelming.   Food is good. Very good. It does give you a smile thank God!"}
{"text":"I took my family here and the food was great since then I've been back 2 other times the people was nice and it wasn't a long waiting period will be back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and friendly staff. Got gravy poured all over it for no extra charge. Reasonable pricing also."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week and was impressed. Everything was made from scratch. Not your run-of-the-mill menu, lots of very different items that I would like to try. the ham and bean soup was out of bounds! Even better than my own. the string beans were also exceptionally good!"}
