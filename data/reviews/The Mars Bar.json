{"text":"Went on a week day, Gyro was small, veggies were not fresh and the meat was dry and burnt. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"For starters....Thursday night gyro is best in town (just the way they make it in Greece) and its very good the rest of the week also... A great local neighborhood watering hole with a great atmosphere and affordable drinks!!!  A must visit..."}
{"text":"Stopped up there last week and they had great food and service. George is great ! This week I tried to stop up on a Tuesday around 5:30 and it was closed. This was the second time I tried to stop up around 5:30 and it was closed. What's up with that ! Seams like its a hit or miss."}
{"text":"One of Lakewood's comfortable, friendly, and accommodating bars.  A variety of traditionally prepared gyro's. Great place to watch a game, catch-up with friends, or happy hour."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff. Gyros are amazing. The owner is very personable and engaging with patrons. I highly recommend this establishment.   Can't wait for the restaurant. See you around!!!!"}
{"text":"The Thursday Night Gyro at the Mars Bar is one of the best around. Definitely a must try for Gyro lovers. The staff is always friendly and the prices are exactly where a local Lakewood bar should be (even the fantastic Micro Brews) they have in stock."}
{"text":"As a native Clevelander, I've been a fan of The Mars Bar for a long time. Recently, my family and I decided to throw my younger brother a going-away party there, and it couldn't have turned out better. The owner George and his staff went above and beyond for us. Everyone had an awesome time and the food was delicious, especially the gyros. I'd highly recommend The Mars Bar if you're looking for great food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great Dive Bar with good gyros for after you've had a few. Small place with a patio out back. One of the best bars in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one to rate. Sliding scale when it comes to dive bars. Just because a review gets 5 stars, doesn't make the joint Pier W. 

Needless to say, the Mars Bar doesn't get 5 stars, but I will give it 4. 

Walked right in and sat down at the bar. Bartender was very nice and had a couple of nice craft brews in front of Jessica and I in no time. 

We asked for 'a menu' and got 'a menu'. I think they only have one in the store!  Not that you need more than one. Gyros and stuff that goes in a fryer is all that's on it. 

So that's what we got, a gyros, fries and fried zucchini strips.   And here's my take:  5 stars for effort, 5 stars for quantity of food, 3 stars for quality. 

The gyros was huge, but everything had a 'crunch' to it. Pita was crispy, meat was crispy, sauce, tomato and red onions were ok, but sparse compared to the amount of meat. Fries were very good. 

Hit my noggin on the ceiling on the way out. Matter in fact, I hit my head on the ceiling going to the shitter, too. I guess Martians are short."}
{"text":"ok i'm biased because i know the owner but its a great corner bar with nice tvs and good cheap beer.  YOU HAVE TO GET A GYRO!!!!!!  the lamb is sliced off the slab when you order and one gyro will fill your belly.  if an upscale dive bar is your thing, then get on over there......today!"}
{"text":"The Mars Bar is a typical corner bar on Madison. I would put this at the top 40% of Lakewood bars, rated on cleanliness and class. They serve gyro's (you can't miss the giant slab of meat in the corner). 

They have a patio, new in 2009. I once asked a friend to meet there and she said \"ew. Gross.\" I thought that was uncalled for, but it gives you an idea of what a prissy girl would think of it. Even so, people around Lakewood love this place. It is pretty small and I wouldn't think it is great for groups unless you wanted to stand and mingle."}
{"text":"Originally came because I found a Groupon and it is within walking distance from a friend's house, but will be back for the gyros! I'm giving it 5 stars because I love small local bars, if you try to go with a big group, you will probably not get seating FYI.
It is a small dive bar, pretty great beer selection. The owner was the only one working on a Friday night, but he paid attention to us, we didn't have to wait long for beers or food.
He told me that his mother actually makes the yogurt for the tzatziki sauce! The gyros were a good size (I took half home) and the basket of fries was enough for three to share, plus they were seasoned already.
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, I kept hearing about this place from friends of mine and everytime it ended with the Gyros.  I finally got to go and watch a game with some friends and the place was a lil quiet but the staff was friendly and they had a good selection of beers and other spirits but my friend surprised me with a Gyro and I was sold in 3 bites!!!   I have to rethink my stance on tzatziki sauce since I usually order it on the side or without entirely cause I'm not a fan.  Until now.  Next time I come it will have to be a Thursday to what I hear is the day to come try some Pork Gyros!!!!  Soon...."}
{"text":"This is a very small dive bar but it's pretty cool. My only issue is that there was only one bartender when I went for an open mic night. She was very nice but was obviously swamped. So, while not her fault, I had to wait way too long for a drink. Overall, very postivie experience though and worth a trip if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but a great experience every time I've come in. Sarah and Chelsea are awesome. George the owner always remembers my name and treats me like family. The food is awesome. If I've forgotten to mention a bartender its not because they're not awesome."}
{"text":"Great little bar!  Try the gyros...they are authentic and delicious.  It's a great place to meet up with some friends (probaly not more than 4-5, as the inside is fairly small) and have a couple drinks/quick bite before heading out downtown, but you could also stay there the whole night and have a great time as well.  Intimate setting without being uncomfortably crowded (usually), reasonably priced drinks, service is quick, and the owners are great guys too.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Horrible bartender. Disgusting gyro. Tried making me pay for it when I took one bite and didn't like it. Had to give an explanation to the manager to take it off the bill. Will never return."}
{"text":"Went there on the recommendation of a friend and a tale of great gyros. What a disappointment the bar had a terrible stench, so we went to the so called patio. Service was okay considering the bar tender was doing it all. The gyros were terrible, I have never had one with mustard before and hope not to ever again. The meat was dry and overlooked and burned, fries were included with the gyro and were tasteless, they also were served inside the sandwich.  Next time I will go to the Greek village."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. It's cheap to drink....and the gyros are seriously fantastic.  I think Thursday nights they don't have lamb and have pork instead annnnnnd they put fries on it.  So you have choice of chicken, veggie or pork.  Quite amazing and it looks like they are expanding into the space next door.  Improving on an already great place.  Very small patio on the side as well.  Think local and drink local."}
{"text":"A friendly dive with an amazing hook, The Best Gyros In Lakewood!

Not much on the inside, but your choice of patio out back or up front on busy Detroit Ave. (Great people watching.)  If this heat has been too much for you lately you need not fret.  The back patio is covered and there are umbrellas at every table out front.  (Which is more than I can say for their competition across the street.)

Large HD televisions with in your face seating at the bar provide a nice place to catch a game."}
{"text":"Above average dive bar!  Minimal menu, but higher quality than most.  Small, but not crowded either.

Their gyros are the real deal, cut fresh and served with plenty of that awesome tzatziki sauce.  

Very generous cocktails, poured by attentive bartenders without the attitude.

Lots of screens to numb your brain, while you numb your brain!"}
{"text":"Visiting home for Christmas and my husband and brother hit up this spot for old times sake (I used to like in Lakewood). God how I love this place. Dead on Thursday, December 22 but the jukebox was busting out great tunes and the whiskey sours were terrific. Really friendly bartender. Love the slab of glistening gyro meat rotating at the end of the bar. The bowls of popcorn were so good. All in all a great place. I love how you can get 2 drinks + tip for 10 bucks in Ohio."}
{"text":"Well I used to go to the Mars Bar several times for drinks. It is a cozy little dive. They supposedly have decent gyros here. Well one such gyro has put me out for a whole day with severe food poisoning. I had to leave early from work because running to the restroom every 15 minutes isn't the best situation for an office. I know 100% that it is from the gyro with the timing of me eating the sandwich at around 9:00 PM at night and then of course 9-10 hours later I wake up nauseous. So far I've been sick for 14 hours now today and it still is rough. 

Never again. You can take your chance on this place if you want but if you're unlucky like me you may get some nasty lamb meat that will ruin the following day with excruciating pain."}
{"text":"Best gyros ever! That is all........"}
{"text":"Started coming back here after many years of driving right by.  From what I have heard they have new owners and the druggie former owners are gone.  Over the years I have seen fights, people being impaled with darts, people puking and even someone who shall remain nameless took a dump on the floor by said dartboard.  So, on to the negative aspects of Mars bar...it smells like food...Greek food.  Dont get me wrong I love me gyros..especially when Im drinking, but when I head over to the Lido I dont want Trudy and all the other dancers getting hungry (I need them to focus on the task at hand)!  They remodeled the place, kinda and it looks a lot like all the other Lakewood bars that took a perfectly good tavern feel and tried to Trend it up to look like a Tremont bar.  The owner and bartenders I have seen recently have all been VERY friendly and are knowledgeable about the fine craft beers they sell.  Cant put my finger on it but this is just a place Ill meet up for a few but continuously think about the next spot I wana head to next.  Maybe It will grow on me.....like Trudy did....."}
{"text":"Great place to get drunk and talk with your friends. Usually good music playing. If not, just take over the jukebox. Quick and friendly service. Nice interior. 

Here's the main reason to go to Mars Bar: THE GYROS. Inexpensive and loaded up with tons of meat and tzatziki. Try it with delicious fries."}
{"text":"Great bar with a very fun and cozy atmosphere! You have to stop in and try their famous gyros! They are sooo good!! Not only are they delicious but they are also huge, enough to share for two. I also loved the fresh cut fries I had with my gyro. 

I think this is a great spot for watching the Cavs or Browns game and enjoy a bite, Great service and good beers on tap. Very laid back atmosphere. If you stop in this winter grab a seat at the end of the bar close to where they keep the lamb for gyros heated, It's the warmest spot in the house!"}
{"text":"Best Gyros in The Land! great place to go for the night if you wanna just kick back and have a few brews and hang with people you love....Great service and awesome owner! Check it out if you haven't"}
{"text":"If you like gyros and great corner dive bars, Mars is a must visit! The gyros are to die for, the bartenders are incredibly friendly and personable. It is a warm and cozy place were you can truly be yourself and just relax. I highly  recommend it for economical drinks and fantastic people watching. Cheers to Mars for being a fantastic neighborhood hangout"}
{"text":"Back when we lived in Cleveland in the late 90s, we spent every Thurs night at Mars. There was a crew of us who met there every week for loads of laughs and fun. That was before the current owners bought it, remodeled it and added a kitchen and patio. These enhancements have only made it better. We stopped in late night on our last trip home. In addition to reasonably priced and strong drinks, they now also have gyros served all night. And let me tell you, they are worth the stop. We call this bar 'old familiar'. Even though it's changed, it still feels warm, honey and the kind of place where everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"Three of us got together during the holiday to have a few drinks and catch up. I can tell you that every single drink we each ordered was half water. The absolutely water down their drinks. We each had 4-5 drinks and were completely sober. It was awful. Plus, the music is so loud you can't speak to one another at all. Needless to say, spend your money on bottled drinks only otherwise you'll be ripped off."}
{"text":"It is a dive bar... not in a bad way. TVs. Music. Booze. What more could you want. I can see meat on a shawarma machine. I'm here on Sunday. Not much happening."}
{"text":"Right across from the Beer Engine is a nice neighborhood bar with the aroma of gyros. 

The service was good and friendly bartenders. 

A new paint job, cool lights, with Greek music on in the background for the first half of the night of my visit and a mix of the jukebox and a sirius/xm station of 90s alternative [sublime, pearl jam, rage] later on. 

The crowd was a mix of working-class and some yuppies. The place itself is pretty small, I wouldn't come in the winter with a group more than 5. 
There's a foosball table and an outdoor patio [closed in winter].

Beer selection: 3-4 drafts but a very impressive bottle selection: about 2-3 dozen microbrew selections [even Chimay, at a pricey $9 for a bottle, it was an excellent craft brew] and all of the domestics. Their liquor selection was varied and they had a complete list of their liquors, beers, types, and ABVs: not enough bars do this. Prices seemed average for a lakewood bar, $4.50 for a tall draft burning river. $3 for a honey brown bottle. 

A solid neighborhood bar with a great microbrew selection [for a dive bar] and I'd like to go back to try the gyros."}
{"text":"The gyro was dry and tasted old. Seemed like we were the only \"out of the place\" people (others were the regulars). Had to go sit at the bar to be helped."}
{"text":"One of the few bars in this area where I can be honest when I say, everyone knows your name. The bartenders are fantastic and service is usually spot on. The owner, George, is present for most shifts and is there to address any problems people have. 

I don't like gyros. Period. In fact I loathe them. BUT the ones at the Mars bar are spot on. tzatziki sauce is made from scratch and is good enough to dip the fresh cut fries in. 

Anytime you need to watch a game and it's not on one of the TVs just tell the bartender and they will put on the channel you want ( they have the NHL network). 

Overall, good place, good people, good time. Gets four stars because there is no liquor on Sundays. Need a gyro, go there."}
{"text":"A dive bar by any definition. Mars seems to be a place set towards an older crowd, which is no way a bad thing, but set in Lakewood there are so many better bars for the big partiers. If you're looking for a great gyro though, this is your place. It's good enough to bring my two star rating to a three. Otherwise the rest of the food is clearly frozen and unappetizing.

The beer selection is \"meh\". That's really the best word for the whole place...meh. Every time I walk out of here, I smell like grease and meat. Not good for the rest of the night. Meh, means not much left to say. Go for the gyro and nothing else."}
{"text":"Pretty nice little bar, they even have a gyro spit right behind the bar.

Cozy bar, pretty small, but as long as there is a spot at the bar you'll be happy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Lakewood bars! Has that friendly neighborhood feel. Such a great place to meet friends, to watch a game, play the jukebox, or just hangout and chat. 

They have a very stocked bar with one of the biggest liquor selections I've seen!

The barmaids are all friendly and pretty. The owner Georgie is also very friendly and makes you feel very welcome. They treat you right here. 

The Gyros are outstanding!! I like to order a side of Gyro meat and Tziki sauce .. the portions are hefty. 

Also there is a patio and the location is great. 

A+++ 
I'd recommend this bar to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had a beer and a gyro, we were happy! Definitely a divey place, but that's a good thing! A tall bud light was only $2.50 and we split a gyro. It was absolutely delicious and huge! I couldn't believe how big it was. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"It's a cute little spot to sit and have a beer with a friend.
They still don't have their kitchen and addition done yet. 
They have gyros.  They are just ok. I'm not sure why people think they are so good. Probably never had one elsewhere.  We had to wait about 30 minutes to get one.  Every other place just slices the meat, grills the bread wrap, adds tomatoes and sauce.  Violoa!  Not here. 
It is nice to have a place that's just a regular bar. Still an original
in Lakewood OH."}
{"text":"Best gyros in Cleveland. Steve's Gyros are nothing but hype. George's mom makes the sauce here and it is pure yogurty goodness made with love. I have been kicked out of this bar. I was in the wrong. This is a great place to go. I would like to see it be themed like Total Recall, to replicate the surface and experience of being on Mars. A woman with three breasts would be a good feature. That was my favorite part of the movie as a kid."}
{"text":"Standard dive bar, had cheap drinks, easy to get to, juke box, smoker area, pretty much everything you're looking for at the end of the night, some solid beers on tap, they have food but kitchen was closed when we got there; still got the job done though"}
{"text":"Best Bar in Cleveland hands down!!
George is the best always takes care of his customers."}
{"text":"Great local spot. Great selection of craft and domestic bottles. Greek owner makes incredible gyros!"}
{"text":"I should start my review by saying that we regretfully have not had a chance to visit the Mars Bar brick and mortar restaurant, but are huge fans of whatever food festival they attend in Lakewood.  This particular review is based off of our experience at the Lakewood Craft Wine and Beer festival.

For the past few years, the Lakewood Craft Wine and Beer festival has been a cold and rainy event.  I know many folks (like us) who will tell you that this will not stop anyone from making the most of the evening - especially after spending over $40 per ticket!  The festival is primarily for beer and wine companies, but Lakewood restaurants attend to sell their fan favorites.  Believe me, with the amount of wine and beer we drank, food was much needed!

We decided to head to the Mars Bar tent to grab some gyros before heading out for round 2 of our drinking tour when the skies decided to really open up.  Rain began pouring down right after we had placed our order, and unfortunately for us we would have to wait at their tent for our food to be prepared rather than seek shelter inside the parking garage where the event was hosted (yes, inside a parking garage).

The 2 men at the Mars Bar tent, who I assume are father and son, invited anyone who ordered food from them into their tent so that no one would have to stand in the rain - even if it meant less room for them to prepare food and lemonade.  As if this wasn't enough, the older gentleman then brought out a bottle of Crown Royal and poured shots for each customer inside the tent.  While the shots were probably unnecessary for the amount we had been drinking (wine and beer festival - no shame!), it was another incredible gesture that helped us recognize what kind of business they ran.  To their credit, I believe some of the other customers may have been friends of theirs, but it did not stop them from including every other person who chose to purchase something from them.

To top it all off, we were served some of the best Gyros in town.  Big, filling and perfect for soaking up the drinks we had already consumed to prepare for round 2.  Now that winter is here, we are looking forward to going to this corner bar to grab some dinner and drinks with friends without having to go to multiple locations.  I'm hoping the service at their location is just as stellar."}
