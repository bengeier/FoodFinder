{"text":"This is a very adorable place and we loved coming here. It was our first time but it was worth it. The food was tasty and the waiter was really nice and helpful.  We definitly recomend it and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Would not take my Groupon. As I went to order, I mentioned the Groupon and the counter person pointed to a board that said they were not taking \"Group Coupons\" or gift certificates. He told me a previous manager set up those forms of payment and had the proceeds not go to the owners but to the manager. Good business management says you should not punish the customers for mistakes you make on personnel. If you want to run a successful business, own up to the mistake, make good on your liabilities if they were sold by someone employed and representing your business and leave the customer with a positive experience.  Edit: I just checked Groupon and as of 7/12/17, they are still selling for this restaurant! If you will not accept Groupons, make sure you discontinue your offerings on the website."}
{"text":"Pizza taste awesome!! I got the lucky 7 special, love that they're not skimpy with ingredients. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent .The pizza came out delicious and the wings were just right. The service was great.I can not wait to come back"}
{"text":"Came in for the 7.77 two topping pick up special. Got no cheese with mushrooms and olives. I  asked the man taking my order for plenty of toppings and boy he delivered. The pizza was a dumping ground for mushrooms and olives. On top of it, I enjoyed it. Friendly staff and good pizza. So many mediocre, not good, over or under cooked pizza places around. This place I will be coming back to."}
{"text":"It was Really easy to park. The menus was great! I ordered the vegetarian delight. There was no shortage of fresh ingredients. The crust was thin style and it was cooked to perfection. The chef shook my hand as I was leaving... feeling welcome to visit again. They had a enormous banquet area which would be good for large groups and celebrations. I didn't see any wine or beer, which was ok since I was driving."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices!! Pizza is very good and the pasta dishes are great. Food is always fresh and hot. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Came in late, after a long day at the park with hungry parents and players. Although they were about to close, Jairo was so accommodating. They stayed open a little later for us and did not rush us out. Food was delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"was expecting more, but wasn't blown away ordered a L pepperoni sausage  & L BBQ sauce chicken w/ mushrooms Chicken tasted too dry. Chicken tasted like the ones you buy at a grocery store in a bag next to the salad section I wouldn't it's that bad, but I wouldn't jump at the chance of trying it again. for a place thats like 5-8 minutes away, it took 45-55 min from time I called to order my food to when the food was delivered"}
{"text":"This place is about the same price as little Caesar's. A large 2 topping pizza is $8.40 after taxes. The quality of this pizza is great for the price. I definitely recommend this place. Plus they offer a free drink OR order of fries if you write a review on google or yelp. Lots of room in the dining area. My only suggestion would be some music in the dining area. Its a bit quiet. Especially for Vegas! Other than that. Great food & service."}
{"text":"Fist time eating in this spot I I highly recommend this location very good pizza,wings and mojo for a great price for all that. I'm from LA and would definitely come back and eat this again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ordered some pizza through Uber eats. Fast and friendly service. The pizza was really delicious!"}
{"text":"Mostly a takeout joint, dine-in available with patio seating. It's somewhat difficult to see this store from the street, and it's in an otherwise deserted plaza. I usually order through Eat24 and just pick up, which is usually ready pretty quick. Prices are low, and you can easily eat here under $10/pp.   The pizza is fine, the build your own option is cheap with an individual cheese pie starting at $4. I appreciate that they use fresh sliced mushrooms rather than cheaping out with the slimy canned version. The wings were okay but I prefer mine crispy and these seemed barely done, and I didn't care for the mango-habanero sauce. I'll try again with another flavor. The $2 Mojo fry (seasoned wedges) side is a great value. Note that there are sandwiches and salads listed on their posted menu in store but not available when ordering through Eat24."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I NEVER eat the ends of my pizza, but I definitely ate it this time. It had the perfect crunch. The sauce was awesome and the staff was very nice. I'll be visiting again really soon."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good big place to eat pizza service is ok. Not the best pizza but I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went in for the 7.77 carry out special and we were not disappointed. For the money, the pizza very good and there was plenty of cheese. We decided to try OMG because of the mostly good review, and we will order from here again. I ordered from Dominos a month or  so ago, and 21.00 later the pizza was crap. This special is a very good value for the price."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but it fits the bill. Take-out, fast, efficient and affordable. They have a roomy dining room/area with a TV but not much ambiance which is just fine. It's really more a delivery/to-go place. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Amazing food always. They never seem to disappoint. Big portions and great prices. Fantastic flavors and textures"}
{"text":"Yummm! Handmade fresh crust, robust flavorful sauce, piled on toppings!! Reasonable price! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is so damn delicious.They have a special, large with 2 toppings.. Friendly,polite,and funny staff. I have found my new pizza spot...you guys have a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"Came in with the softball team after a 4 game day. This place was Amazing! We ordered the fettuccine with garlic cheese bread  pizza  wing and drinks. Reasonably priced and excellent service."}
{"text":"Checked out this new pizza shop today. Had a \"individual\" sized pizza and a fountain drink for $5.71. The fella behind the counter, I think his name was Marco, was super nice and I really liked the personal touch."}
{"text":"Pizza is flavorful, crust perfect, wings delicious! Friendly service as well. Way better than Napoli's, whose customer service is terrible and pizza is greasy."}
{"text":"YELP DEAL IS NO LONGER VALID  Apparently this was a remnant from previous management   Had a large specialty pizza. We couldn't choose which flavor, so we went with their last option - EVERYTHING   The pizza was a good hefty amount of toppings  and filled me and my bf up very well with a few left over slices.   The girl who worked there was also very nice.  It was weird you can only get the specialty pizza in size large.    They also didn't have anchovies   But they do have hot sauce plus your regular fixings (crushed red pepper and parm cheese)"}
{"text":"New place, looks like it's family owned and managed, hole in the wall. My husband, kid and myself ate for under $20 and it was delicious! Great ending to an afternoon at the xplozone... def worth the drive across town for us."}
{"text":"So this is my first time ordering delivery from the yelp eats feature and glad to see PayPal works just fine. The navigation was super easy when checking out nearby pizza joints and therefore discovering this place not even a mile away from where I live. The estimated delivery time was suppose to be 30 minutes but boy was it 10 minutes too early! I ordered the veggie lovers pizza and it was more that filling. Packets of peppers and cheese, napkins along with styrofoam plates came with this order. Will be ordering from them again in the future."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! but dont take my word for it go try it. The $7.77 its a great deal to take out it got me a Hawaiian and the place its nice to eat in as well I'm taking my girl there next time"}
{"text":"Clean, nice staff. Variety of pizza choices. They have a pupusa style pizza. (Loroco y queso) Oh hell yeah, that's cool!"}
{"text":"It has plenty parking space, Great taste and excellent service! Pleasent atmosphere! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I usually get it trough Postmates but I recently walked in and the lady there was super nice! Cant explain how much i love the chicken Alfredo pasta!! Yummm .... the pricing is also amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with the family  Good pizza Great staff and great price. Will be back when I'm going down Sahara BLVD checking out my next spot.."}
{"text":"Came across a new pizza place today.  OMG pizza!  Had a pepperoni with cheese which hit the spot.  Chef Mario really knows his pizza.  He said he was in the business for 30 years and developed his recipe.  OMG pizza is the first 'build your own pizza' place I have ever seen which I will have to try next time.    The ny style crust was light, nice slightly sweet pizza sauce - pepperoni and mozzarella cheese - cooked to perfection.     I love pizza and have eaten many pies in Illinois (Chicago style) and California (New York Style ) but this is definitely up in my top 5 .    They offer pastas, salads sandwiches and desserts.   I will say this is probably one of the largest pizza parlors with plenty of parking.    Just off hidden in a strip mall - only open for about 2 months.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Do not go there. It's not good and the soda machine was filthy. They weren't clean people or a clean restaurant. I don't trust it at all and I will never go back. More like OMG that was fuckin terrible."}
{"text":"This pizza restaurant is so good I highly recommend it to who ever is looking for good service awsome food and a great peice..."}
{"text":"So we found this place on here(Yelp) with 4 and half stars. After a long hot day of softball we wanted something fast, easy and affordable. So on a positive note, we ordered by phone in and it was ready when we had arrived 20 minutes later. A++ The owners and associates were extremely helpful and nice. Place was clean. Lots of room for large parties if you needed to sit with friends and family, and also extremely affordable. We ordered a Hawaiian, maherita pizza and wings. Visually the pizza looks very appetizing and it was good, just feel like it's missing spices or some sort of spice or flavor...The wings were cooked perfectly fine and were very good. We ended up getting the Hot which were actually hot. I would replace the ranch with a creamier ranch though . Like I said before.. customer service was excellent and that's what would also make me go back again."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and they were good enough that I thought I'd try it. Sounded great for a Friday night BUT- BUT no delivery drivers. Party Foul! Pizza Foul! BUSINESS FOUL!!!!!"}
{"text":"WORST FOOD!   It's movie night. Pizza and chicken wings.   My boyfriend was really excited to try his newly found 5 star pizza joint here on yelp, which I later discovered 5stars with 4 reviews, lol, he just didn't know better.   15 minutes before arrival, our food was ordered. We walked in, we waited and after 20 minutes of waiting the guy came out and said \"don't worry, we are about to put your pizza in. 12 minutes later, we got our food.   We ordered pizza. Chicken extra well done and French fries and took them to the drive ins.  Had couple of bites of pizza, I didn't like it so I turned to the chicken wings.  I like my wings extra crispy so when I see that it was pale I did not touch it.  However my boyfriend grab a couple and started eating them. He said it tasted funny so he turned the light on and saw the bloody wings. OMG, HOW DISGUSTING THAT WAS!   So as a last resort we turned toward the fries as our last savior. Upon searching in the bag, surprisingly they were no where to be found.   What a night-mare!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, my friends and I were a little hesitant to try this place, especially arriving at lunch time  and seeing it empty. But we decided to give it a try anyways. OMG Pizza did not disappoint.  BBQ chicken pizza has always been my favorite and this one was really good! My friends chose their custom pizza and were very happy with what they got."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel near omg pizza and the prices are really cheap. For a large two topping it's only $7.77. For a specialty pizza it's like $13.99 but they have various specials when you get there. It's in a plaza with plenty of parking. The restaurant is pretty plain and spacious but very clean. It's basically a no frills or thrills pizza joint. I walked in and ordered a lucky 7 special which is the 2 topping large pizza for $7.77. the lady said 15 minutes but a really took 30 that was I wasn't in a hurry and it seemed like they had alot of take out orders. They don't do slices. The price is so cheap why do slices any ways.   They basically do pizza, wings, salad and pasta that's it. They pizza I had was a pepperoni and sausage. They're was a decent amount of toppings and the pizza tasted good. Nothing that was like OMG but good for the price."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience .   Ordered $75 worth of pizza to just keep getting delayed and my pizza wasn't going to arrive for 2 1/2 hours later ..  never again will i order from here ."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas, decided we wanted some pizza for dinner.  Wanted try try something that was not part of a \"big chain\", saw OMG Pizza and decided to give it a try - boy am i glad we did.   The pizza was perfect, the crust nice and crispy with a hint of garlic, the tomotoe sauce they used was obviously home made in house, served piping hot on actual plates, instead of paper plates.  And, to top it off, the LARGE pizza we had, with 2 toppings, was lucky 7.77!  They are relatively new, only been in business this year, so probably not widely known yet.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've ordered here 3 times now. Pizza was on point each time. Today's pizza was so perfect! Thank you OMG Pizza for opening your doors in my delivery radius. Shout out to the delivery guy too. Pizza was delivered on time and hot. Delivery guy is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"It's pretty good pizza for the price they charge and accurate on the time frame when order for delivery.  I order the Pizza Fiesta and the Fettuccine Alfredo I also wanted wings but they didn't have any at the moment but it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Much better than I was expecting. I was hoping for decent what i got was great. The crust was incredible and the toppings were abundant. I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats.  Mediocre food at best. The only item that was above average is the onion rings, crunchy and the  onion inside not dried out. The pizza was soggy with very skimpy toppings. Looks very cheap.  The potato wedges tasted stale. The skin on the mango habanero wings was not crispy, while the sauce was weak and flavorless. Will NOT order from this place again at all."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...  I have a gluten allergy so I try my best to live a gluten free lifestyle.   When my friends decided that they wanted pizza I didn't mind where they got it from because I was pretty sure I wasn't going to eat it.     However, OMG has this pizza called mariachi with chorizo and I just had to try it.   I've never had chorizo on pizza and was super excited.   It was a bit of a let down.   The flavor was lacking and the dough of the pizza itself was hard and pretty flavorless.   This pizza basically tasted like processed mozzarella cheese with jalapenos on top.     We also got 4 flavors of wings and a Greek salad.   The salad was good (the ingredients were fresh) and the wings were ok.   The habanero mango sauce was pretty generic and not that spicy.   It actually tasted more like Asian sweet chili sauce.   We got BBQ, medium and lemon pepper wings as well and they were pretty average.     I'm not saying I'd never eat here again.   It wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had but I definitely won't be seeking this place out on purpose."}
{"text":"We tried this place a month ago and the pizza was ok, at least better than most places around here. However we ordered again a few days ago for take out and they said 45 min. We arrived 45 min after ordering and had to wait another 30 minutes. Was about to walk put and it was done, they gave us a whole $1 off the pizza.  Time to keep trying other places. They need to get it together."}
{"text":"First time and the food was good. Service was very attentive. I got the chicken pram. Chicken was juicy for being fried and the marinara sauce was good. Bread was very soft and could tell it was fresh. Hubby got the steak and cheese and enjoyed his as well. Prices we great for the portion size receive. If we are in the area we would go back."}
{"text":"Store very clean, was greeted with a smile and prices was very reasonable. Comfortable chairs and booth very colorful nicely coordinated. Temperate controlled restaurant, not hot just right. Party room separated from main lobby. Nice patio to sit down to enjoy fresh air. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and a soda to drink. Medium drink very good in price it beats other prices in other restaurants by far. Music played over the speaker was not over bearing. Pizza tasted very good very nice sauce, crust nice and thin and not over cooked. Will be going BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a hidden \"bang for your buck\" eatery. Most of the menu is themed after good ole Las Vegas, such as \"Black Jack Special\", \"Lucky 7\" which is reflected in the price.  This place has chicken wings, pastas, chicken strips, salad, and best of all- Pizzas !  Fabulous prices  ! Definitely a go to for take out. They provide exclusive special occasion birthdays, family reunion, sports game gathering.  Very good, eh!! Thumbs up"}
