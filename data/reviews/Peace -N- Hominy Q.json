{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for wings in Belmont...the plain wings and 3 amigos sauce for dipping are my fav. Sauced wings are delicious too. Finally customer service has always been unbelievably great, so great that I generally tip in advance for takeout orders."}
{"text":"This restaurant's food is full of nothing but love. This is the most tender and delicious. It is a perfect little place to have great barque. I would strongly suggest bringing u and ur family to this restaurant. The brisket is unbelievable. With a side of this wonderful beefy Mac and cheese. They are very friendly and have great service. I would recommend going here at anytime."}
{"text":"Omg so good!! I came here for brunch, and the food was to die for. I loved the combination of flavors on the biscuit, pulled pork, and egg concoction. Great food, friendly people, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome ribs!!! It looks like a dive on outside, but cute inside and worth stopping for!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Loved the sauces and the pork butt. The jalapeño coleslaw was a hit with us as well. I feel if I would have chosen a different side this may have been a 5 star review! Definitely worth a stop to fill that hungry bell you yours"}
{"text":"Phenomenal BBQ! Friendly and fun environment with exceptional service. Great portions and selection of meals. My wife and I ordered two different plates - brisket and pulled pork - and we shared and loved it all. Very flavorful BBQ even before using the good sauces (my preference was \"three amigos\"). Really wish I had saved room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. They have the BEST ribs I've had in all of Charlotte!  Been there the times and the service is excellent as well.  The setting is rustic and the utensils are wooden, but the place has a charm ask it's own.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We have visited 4 times. Staff has been very friendly and we loved the atmosphere. Great food! We have tried a different dish each time and looking forward to trying their breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue! Good country food in a quaint small-town location. Friendly staff top it off."}
{"text":"Driving up I85 from SC was checking Yelp for highly  recommended places to eat. Yelp didn't lie!  Had pulled pork and beef brisket. Both fantastic. Servers went out of their way to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Excellent food with even better vibes. Thank you for the feast and inspiration, keep up the hard work!"}
{"text":"Very good food and a relaxed environment. Had the double meat platter with beef brisket and pulled pork. Onion rings and jalapeño slaw. Big portions and fair price. Going back!  Well went back and tried their burger. I've had worse but I've also had better. It was descent size and fresh, but my request for rare was not obliged.   What a shame..."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and sides.  The staff was pleasant and friendly.  Great banana pudding and key lime pie.  Get the potato salad.  Great value for the price."}
{"text":"First time here with my crew from Dallas and I must say this food was awesome!  I had the pull pork sandwich that was great!  All of the guys loved there food and we will be back when in town!  Oh yeah the hush puppies were awesome as well."}
{"text":"Yelp nailed this one.  What a cute BBQ place with great service and delicious food.  Loved all the sauce options.  The three amigo sauce was my personal fav.  They offer 3 different slaws.  The jalapeño slaw wasn't too hot but had good flavor.  Our table ordered the pork, chicken, pork and brisket so we pretty much tried it all.  Everyone left full and happy.  Oh and if you get beers to go they even have bottle openers to take with you."}
{"text":"Wow what find!  Visiting our son in Charlotte and found this place.  Very friendly, food was excellent and fair prices.  Will definitely come back when we are down again."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to drive to this location after reading the reviews on Yelp.  We arrived and were greeted warmly by the staff and proceeded to place our order.  The food arrived and wow it was amazing. The BBQ was wonderful, the Brunswick Stew was the best ever, the Mac and cheese had a wonderful smoky cheese flavor.   My goodness I live this place!!  Will be back often!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.....everytime I fly to Charlotte I am here eating within an hours time after landing....everythings great but I really love their stew!"}
{"text":"What a sweet place with a very friendly staff. The food is DELISH!!!  We went for Sunday brunch & ordered the porkapaloosa-which was crazy good with chorizo gravy-and pancakes covered in fresh apple syrup. Can't wait to come back & try out their dinner options.  You've got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Everything (almost everything) is pork. Ive tried this place for both breakfast and lunch and recommend sticking to lunch / dinner.  Breakfast was uninspiring.  Afternoon meals are decent but I felt a bit pricy for food on disposable plates (fancy but still disposable).  The brisket is pretty tasty.  Overall OK but nothing special IMO."}
{"text":"This place is consistently amazing. The food is cooked to perfection. We've had many items from the menu and have never been disappointed. Just AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Very good, love small business, especially those with excellent food! Definitely recommend this place, it's adorable and yummy!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there!  The food was great.  Service was wonderful.  What a great addition to Belmont.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great bbq spot.  Went on a whim after reading some of the reviews.  I expected to be underwhelmed, but found myself totally impressed.  I tried the pulled chicken, pulled pork, and the brisket.  Each of these had a nice crust with just the right smokiness to the meat.  Even better, each was juicy, not dried out and screaming for more sauce.  I enjoyed the 'Three Amigo's' sauce but found myself enjoying the meat without it as well.    Decent bottled beer selection here.  Very friendly staff. Simple decor and tables fitting a bbq location."}
{"text":"I was visiting my uncle upon return from my deployment and we were looking for lunch close by. I saw it on here and was wanting to try something local...BEST DECISION OF THE WEEK. The food is super tender and the BBQ sauces were excellent. I highly suggest the pork plate with a side of chorizo it's excellent. The vinegar and hot BBQ sauces mixed together are an excellent combo."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from family.  Small place with lots of character. Tried the pork plate with beans. My wife had the pork plate with jalapeño slaw. Pork was great although could have been a little warmer. Everything was great and service excellent. Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's in the middle of nowhere and indoor seating is limited. But the food is absolutely delicious. Get the brisket. It is is so tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I am dumbfounded that anyone has ever really had real BBQ. If you say you smoke something for hours, then you should actually smell smoke upon arrival. NO SMOKE SMELL!  Actually No smoke flavor at all in the BBQ.  I suspect electric smokers which to me is not real BBQ.  The onion rings were good.  Adding a few Jalapenos to the top of the cole slaw does not justify \"Jalapeno Cole Slaw\".  We arrived late, approx 30 minutes before closing and the Lady rolled her eyes as we walked in.  No one ever checked on us to see if we were enjoying our meal.  WAY BETTER BBQ IN GASTON COUNTY!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. Bbq is good and the restaurant is nice. Order at counter then go sit down they bring the food and you pig out. Very nice."}
{"text":"Yum! A neat place to go and I love the BBQ and chicken wings. I also love the assortment of soda pop in the bottle that are made with  real cane sugar they offer. Can't wait to go back and try breakfast there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, even better service! So happy we found this place.  Make sure to get the hush puppies."}
{"text":"This place is FIRE!!!!!  The service is exceptional. It's like sting at a family member's house. I had the brisket plate. As a native of Houston, TX, I judge all barbecue establishments by their brisket. The brisket was smoked perfectly.  It was juicy and delicate with subtle hints of smoke and crunchiness. It reminded me of how my father (Butch) does it. In addition, the spicy sauce was amazing. I love a tomato based sauce and yours is superlative. It's unique, with the right blend of heat and tang."}
{"text":"Their BBQ was delicious and I would have to say the best in Gaston County.  I also lovede the jalapeno slaw.  The environment is pretty casual - order at the register and the food is brought to the table.  The only negative comment and it's very minor, I wish they had a a BBQ sauce that had slightly The 4 that were on the table were very good."}
{"text":"Took a 2 mile detour after finding this little gem on Yelp while on the way to ATL! Absolutely awesome. Had the turkey sandwich....with the 3 Amigo House made sauce. Smoked Turkey at that with the cheesy grits. Definitely worth a stop!!! Very quaint and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Great little hole-in-a-wall. Very small but never have a problem with waiting. The staff is VERY friendly and welcoming. We go about every other weekend with my family. The menu is easy to understand and the first time they actually take the time to happily explain it to you! The food. Let's just say it's the best bbq in my life. And I normally don't care for wings. But they are the best!! The portions are great for the price. The drink options seems unlimited. My fiance and i love this place so much and I'm actually talking to someone tomorrow about catering for my wedding! Please, if you have never been, try it! I know you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Combine that with good prices and good people and this was an excellent place to stop."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the first time at about 7:15. They close at 8:00. They were out of brisket and ribs. I was glad. Why? Because it means they only want to serve fresh food. The pork was outstanding, as was the chicken. The service was friendly, and the young woman who took our order was a genuine delight. I didn't catch her name, but she must be family.  Give them a try, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We visited this place and were from Texas where the BBQ is hard to beat and it was DELICIOUS!!  We had brisket, pulled pork and wings. Homemade onion rings and the jalapeño slaw was amazing too."}
{"text":"With such a high user rating on Yelp... I made this restaurant a priority on my list while returning to the area on business. My meal was good but nothing special. I absolutely love BBQ and would have to say that while nothing was bad.....very little stood out as great or outstanding. I ordered the 3 meat plate (pulled chicken, pulled pork, and smoked turkey) with slaw, beans, and potato salad. The chicken was very dry, pulled pork was average, but I must say the smoked turkey was very good. In my opinion the hallmark of any quality BBQ will be the sauce.....and again I found them to be....average. I tried all four and was unimpressed. Like the sauce, the beans and slaw where simply average. The potato salad was good and as other reviews pointed out the hush puppies are uniquely sweet and standout as different. Enjoyed my meal well enough, but would not likely return or recommend it as a \"must do\"."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat breakfast. It's usually packed so be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have done dinner and brunch and every thing has been spot on. Staff is friendly. Only downside is it is a bit small, so seating can be difficult at times. I am becoming a regular. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST. I found this place while exploring the Belmont/Mt. Holly area. My husband was delighted to discover they offer bacon as an entree  the pulled pork, smoked turkey, bacon - everything is SO DELICIOUS. And the owners/staff are incredible.   We actually had Christine (one of the awesome owners) and her husband handle catering our wedding at The Palmer Building. The food was incredible (our guests raved), they took a great care of us, and the prices were way better than reasonable. I couldn't recommend this place more!!"}
{"text":"Headed to the Charlotte Airport to fly home to fly home to San Diego, we checked Yelp to locate a good spot for lunch. Peace -N- Hominy came in with great reviews so we decided to try it. Our family of 5 was greeted warmly and we almost felt \"at home\" in this cozy little place. Awesome decorations and friendly atmosphere were only the beginning to our stellar experience. The food was AMAZING! Between the five of us, we tried almost everything on the menu. Family favorites were the delicious ribs and the slightly-sweet hush puppies, fried to crunchy (not hard) perfection. I was also excited to see Brunswick stew on the menu as I grew up with it and have never seen it in a restaurant. I was not disappointed. Truly, our one and only complaint is that Peace -N- Hominy is 2300+ miles from home."}
{"text":"Delicious little hole in the wall!!! We're from CA and was out here visiting family... we will MOST DEFINITELY be back next visit!! Had pulled pork, pulled brisket and a hamburger, everything was amazing. The hush puppies... BEST we've had!!!"}
{"text":"First visit and it was amazing. Got the pulled chicken sandwich with bbq slaw and bourbon baked beans. Would give more than 5 stars if I could. Staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Eat inside or out. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Peace N Hominy is on the top of my list of places to take out-of-town guests even though I can't say it has the best BBQ within a 20 miles radius. The employees are friendly, food tasty, decorations cute and welcoming -- all in all a quintessential southern joint in a nice small town that will impress your out-of-town guests (especially those from bigger cities).     I am not a big meat eater, so I will skip discussing the Qs. I love their grits (not instant) but don't care for the sweet hush puppies too much.   Actually I like their weekend brunch most as they offer some unique and interesting takes on brunch food, centering around BBQ."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork with incredible hush puppies that are slightly sweet. The jalapeño cole slaw is spicy. The cheesy grits were also good. Seating is very limited but staff is very kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"Our family has hit A LOT of BBQ joints around the Charlotte area.  This is probably my new second favorite spot for food and first for atmosphere and service.  We had Pul'd pork, brisket, bacon, wings, grits, bourbon beans, slaw, cream corn and banana pudding and apple crisp.  (Big Family)  All the meat was well smoked and tasted fantastic.  The pork was pulled in chunks and had very little fat attached.  Great brisket and it was incredible with their 3 amigos sauce.  The wings - amazing!  Only thing we didn't care for were the grits.  Not bad but not a lot of flavor.  We are also from the North originally, so we are a bit picky about grits.    The staff made sure we were happy and being taken care of.  Prices were very fair.  Place was had great atmosphere and was clean.  Great selection of glass bottle sodas and beer.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We found this spot on Yelp during a road trip.  It's kind of in the middle of nowhere (at least based on our experience).  We loved it.  My sister had a pulled pork sandwich, I had ribs, and my son had the combo.  If anything, our complaint was that it was too much food.  We really enjoyed the hush puppies.  The mac and cheese and grits seemed a bit excessive given how much meat there was.  I think our sides would have seemed better if we weren't so full!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast, full of personality, flavor and kitch.   The BBQ is good, on point with the smoke and flavor. Sauces are tasty. Breakfast sandwich was a little plain, the hash was very good and Gluten free."}
{"text":"An incredibly awkward experience here. They were training a server and the person training them was incredibly rude to the trainee to the point of the customers feeling super awkward. I was hoping the food would be good but the BBQ was dry and uninspired. I was hoping for a good BBQ in Belmont but this isn't it."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Great vibe within store - rustic yet very clean.  Owners William and Christine are very nice as well.  I absolutely recommend trying Peace N Hominy!"}
{"text":"We ate here in our way to Pensacola and it was a great experience. Talking about southern hospitality, great food, awesome atmosphere at killer prices. This is your place."}
{"text":"Wowsers!  Awesome pulled pork!  This was my first time here, and if a place offers pulled pork that will be the first thing I'll try - so I did.  I was not disappointed, in fact I was very pleased.  The pulled pork was just delicious!  It was moist, tender and has a nice smokey flavor to it and a flavorful bark.  There is no need for sauce, but if you want sauce they have a small but most suitable variety with their original and hot tomato based sauces, a vinegar based sauce and one that's a mix of the other three.  For sides I tried the jalapeño slaw and bourbon (baked) beans.  The slaw was slightly creamy with a nice crunch and a wee bit of jalapeño bite.  Me, personally - I would like more jalapeño, but I've been told my taste buds are burned out.  The beans were very tasty, but nothing unique.  Just good baked beans.  The meal was very reasonably priced, and the staff was very friendly and attentive to everyone.  The next time I'm in town I will certainly be back - which is my measure for an above average dining experience.  So check it out for yourself!  I don't think you will be disappointed :-)  Back in town and had to check on my favorite local Q-Joint.  I tried the chicken tonight and I thought my tastebuds had died and gone to heaven!  The chicken was excellent!  Tender, moist and a great smokey overtone.  You may opt for sauce but you won't need it with this chicken!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely mindblowingly bad.  Flavorless meat, soupy stouffers style Mac and cheese and the worst offense has to be the pimento cheese which was similar to canned cheese?  This is a place that made me question every yelper out there."}
{"text":"My favorite place! Love it! Porkapalooza is everything! Wish I didn't move from belmont, don't get it enough now!"}
{"text":"Was are first time in this place. It's a walk up and place your order and sit and they bring it to you. Staff was awesome they knew we were first timers and came over and went over the menu with us... Me and the wife both had breakfast and is top five of breakfast place in  Area... small inside but by time we ordered there was an open table... will diff be returning...."}
{"text":"Delicious! The pork melts in your mouth! Hush puppies are to die for. Small but quant. Very friendly staff, quick service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have had numerous issues with this place.  So bad that about 2 years ago I sent a personal email to the owner describing how awful my experience was and he offered to send me a $25 gift card and comp my meal on the grounds I would not give the restaurant a negative review online.  I turned down the $25 gift card but did allow him to comp my meal.  I was so mad at the incident I told myself I would never eat at this restaurant again.  Well, due to some slim pickings I made the decision to eat here again.  So I've eaten here about 4 times since I sent that email.  So this is spread across the last couple of years.  So let's just go through those times  1st time) I ordered online.  Chose the ASAP option.  Get there and the staff knew nothing about my order.  I had to wait in the restaurant 25 minutes for my order because they were \"backed up\".  I did not really think anything of it.  I wrote it off as an exception, probably won't happen again.  2nd time) I order online again.  Chose the ASAP option.  Get there and again they have no clue about my order.  I even waited 20 minutes before leaving my house.  I tell the staff, the lady at the front said \"look we are busy, you might have ordered online but you also need to call and check to see where your order is in line\".  I was taken aback, I thought, \"man that was a pretty rude exchange.\"  I waited an additional 20 minutes for my food at the restaurant.  Anyway, I said ok, you know I will just call next time.  Not a big deal I guess. I definitely left feeling uneasy  3rd time) I order online.  Chose ASAP option.  Then called.  Was told on the phone my order would take about 25 minutes.  I then go there 25 minutes later.  I walk in, they say \"online order?\"  I say \"for (insert name)?\" they say \"yes\"  I say \"for (insert name)?\" Just to double check, again \"yes\" . I drive all the way home, I open the order, it is 100% someone else's order.  I call, I say \"you guys gave me the wrong order\".  They say \"we are sorry, can you come back?\".  So I drive all the way back to the restaurant only to find my order is there sitting.  I said \"look, I have been away for 25 minutes, I do not want that cold food.  Can you remake it?  I mean, this was your mistake?\"  O they remade it, but they were not happy.  And I had to WAIT, an additional 20 minutes.  Do the math on that guys.  It took me an hour and a half to get a simple burger and fries.  4th and Last time) My wife is hesitant that I even order.  She said, \"we have never had a good experience\".  \"Well\" I said, \"let's give it another try, ok?\".  So I order a Pig Burger or whatever it's called and an All American burger with a side of BBQ slaw. I order online, choose ASAP option . Call ahead, confirm my online order.  It's going to take about 25 minutes.  I say \"ok\".  I show up 35 minutes later!  Just to be safe.  I get there and the manager comes out.  She is wide eyed.  She says, \"Are you (insert name)?\" I say \"Um, yes?\"  She goes \"look, we gave someone else your order.  We think they may come back and we can give it to you\" . I say \"WHAT!? No, don't give me that order.  Remake it at least.\"  She said \"ok\" She was about to give me a cross contaminated order.  And did not even think about that.  So they remade it.  The manager felt bad and even said she was \"sorry\".  I said \"no hard feelings\".  I wait 20 minutes.  I get the remade order.  I take it to the car, my wife checks it.  THERE IS NO LETTUCE, TOMATO, PICKLE, on the All American Burger and NO BBQ SLAW.  So not only did you make me wait an additional 20+ minutes for your mistake, you did not even give me the right order.  So I go back in.  The staff starts bickering back and forth.  They literally just send the food back there and some guy adds lettuce, pickle, tomato.  It was gross.  I make sure to ask, \"did you include BBQ slaw?\"  They said \"yes\". Again, I take it to the car.  My wife checks.  She goes \"THERE IS NO BBQ SLAW!?!?\"  I was livid.  I go in (mind you I have now been there 45 minutes for an order I placed online an hour ago) and said \"There is no bbq slaw, I even asked\" . The manager was livid at the staff.  I said \"I am going to have to review you online and I will never eat here again.\"  And left.  I eventually got home an hour and 15 minutes from when I left.  My wife got sick from the burger.   This was the last straw.  So here is my review.  The food is ok.  You cannot order the pork plates because they are too small.  Burger is the only bet.  But they will get your order wrong and make you feel like it is your fault it is wrong.  Also, it is not enough food.  They short you.  I am not an obese male either.  I am a regular person who for a $11 meal thinks I should get more than 4 onion rings when they cost an additional $1.00 as a side item.  I will never eat here again. I have never ONCE had a normal experience here.  There was always a problem"}
{"text":"Not awful...but not remarkable in any way.  Ordered BBQ pork plate with original slaw and cheese grits. Server forgot the slaw, initially, but provided upon request.    Cheese grits were lumpy and bland.  Apparently, they went the route of Kraft shredded cheese (mild cheddar and mozzarella) which combined to make something akin to wet plaster in texture and taste.  Truly awful.  Crust on hush puppies was very tough; which made me think they were re-fried or left in fryer too long.   BBQ was smoked okay; though the outside cuts didn't indicate any seasoning.  Sauces are served on the side, which I prefer, with the choices being Hot, Original, and Vinegar. Watch out when using them; as the dispensers tend to spray uncontrollably.  I've had BBQ all over NC and usually find it delicious.  I'd suggest looking for something other than this place.  Someone with active tastebuds needs to help their cooks develop a signature taste.  March 26, 2015"}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 meat plate of pulled pork and brisket with jalapeno slaw, creamed corn, and hushpuppies. My wife had the brisket plate, mac and cheese, BBQ slaw, and hushpuppies.  Brisket - Honestly, the worst we have ever had. The Himalayan salt and pepper rub was too much to handle. The brisket was inedible. It had a wet, thick topping/crust that was too salty to eat.  Pulled pork - It wasn't the best I've had but not the worst.  Creamed corn - Tasty side to balance out the salty brisket.  Mac & cheese - It was ok, but needed seasoning and salt.  Hushpuppies - I loved them but my wife didn't like the salty/sweet combination with sugar dusting on a regular hushpuppy.  Slaws - Best slaw we've had. The jalapeno slaw had pickled and fresh jalapeno, plus banana peppers. The BBQ slaw was yummy and had a great balance.  Since the brisket was inedible, we will never go back."}
{"text":"Great bbq.  Stumbled into. Found on yelp. 3 amigo sauce was great. Brisket.  Pork. All good. Great fries"}
{"text":"We were absolutely blown away by the quality and taste of the food, as well as the unbelievable customer service. Six of us stopped on the way back from a conference, and we were completely satisfied. The original sauce with the pulled pork was so tender and flavorful. We all shared and tried a majority of the menu. Definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why all my fellow Yelpers rate this so highly. The pork was average and barely warm. The Mac and cheese was cold and bland, even when BBQ sauce was added. some rave about the jalapeno slaw. If not for the tiny slice of jalapeno on top, I would not have known it was supposed to be jalapeno slaw. No heat, no tang, no pepper flavor, nada! Just plain mayo slaw.  And what is it with brisket around here. Can no one smoke a damn brisket? Even the bark was bland. No smoke flavor, no rub flavor, nothing. I don't get it. The onion rings had promise, but...cold. The ribs were the only thing we go that was hot. They were ok. Actually the best thing we had.   On top of everything, $40! $40 for a BBQ plate, 1/2 rack of ribs, a sandwich and 1 beer!?!? I guess I expect to much. Maybe I should lower my standards and not be disappointed.  Nah, I love GOOD food and will gladly pay for it. But I really don't get 4+ stars here. I guess Belmont doesn't have much to compare it too."}
{"text":"This spot gets better every time we come. Great food. Awesome service. Updated decor. We love it!"}
{"text":"Not your average BBQ. Fantastic food. Sunday brunch specials are great. Would have gotten 5 stars but the place is small and seating can be a challenge because  everyone is trying to get in."}
{"text":"Cute place with great food! I got a great pulled chicken sandwich. The hush puppies are slightly sweet but very good!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and fell instantly in love with this quaint little spot. I ordered the pork-a-palooza which was a huge plate full of home fries, pork, eggs and chorizo gravy. I also went ahead and got a side of biscuits and chorizo gravy for the table to share. The chorizo gravy was definitely the star of the entire meal but the pulled pork was a close second. The food was filling, tasted great and reasonably priced. Great value all around. Also, be sure and try their honey butter here. I've had honey butter many times before but theirs was so good we had to go back for seconds after everyone gobbled up our first side serving(s). I was also able to grab a couple bites off of our friends carolina hotcakes and they were uniquely tasty as well. Maybe a little heavy on the \"sweet\" side but that's never been a problem for me. The only thing I can say that is bad about this place is that the seating are is tiny and I do mean tiny. It probably seats a couple dozen people max."}
{"text":"Fantastic ribs (only offered on Friday nights from what I understand!) One friend got chicken tenders which were pretty good, but told me the fries were just average. The environment is small and quaint . . . But the service is exceptional and very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Jamie was great!! The food was so good! Our first time here and we loved it. She is so sweet, kind and sweet to all the customers. She took time to walk us through the menu and answer our questions! We will definitely be back!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little hidden gem. The one door is entrance to drugstore but they have an entrance just inside. Cutely decorated, southern charm! Absolutely amazing customer service. Explained everything. You place your order at the counter, pay then pick a table. Pulled pork was good, ham was very good, chicken tad dry.  Onion rings homemade and great taste. Hush puppies WOW slight sweet taste almost desert yum! Mac and cheese creamy good. 3 slaw choices regular was flavorful and the jalapeño one had just enough kick !  At first thought portion was small for price but left full and little leftovers. 2 plates of 2 meat, the sides, tea and pimento cheese to go was $34.  Will come back again! More food to try!!"}
{"text":"The meat was coarse grained, no flavor, no smoke ring.  It was dry, and tough to chew.  It seemed like cushion meat or knuckle- two of the cheapest cuts available.  The hush puppies were bland, over cooked, and had been sitting for quite a while before they were thrown on my plate- one landing in my brunswick stew.  The slaw was sadly the high point, but was a meager 2 tablespoons.  The stew was ok, but only after adding copious amounts of sauce.   The veggies in the stew seemed to be frozen processed junk.  There are more references to god than at a Catholic funeral.  The Jesus music is so loud, the plates rattle.  The church- like religious messages did not prevent alcohol from being served.  Their God clearly thinks alcohol is not a problem to sell."}
{"text":"Tried this place once by myself o liked it so much I went back again the next day! Best pulled chicken bbq around and worth the drive from Huntersville. They get busy and the dining room is small so try to avoid peak hours if you don't feel like waiting. If you do the wait is worth it! Go and enjoy this Belmont gem."}
{"text":"Absolutey phenomenon Q here. One of the best menus I've seen with many outside the box items. The hush puppies are the best I've ever had! I got a 2-meat plate w Brisket, pulled Pork, Jalepeno slaw (awesome), Bourbon baked beans and some house pickled spicy carrots. Everything was truly outstanding. Very friendly service and a comfy, county atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You can't beat family owned and operated restaurants. Everything is home made and the staff is incredibly friendly. My pulled pork was cooked perfectly! We are visiting  from out of town and wanted to try a place that isn't where we live. I'm glad we found this place!  We even began a friendly conversation with the group seated next to us. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"It's decent BBQ in a state filled with a lot of pretenders.  They have good food and even better service.  They also have a nice pitch, with the in-house sauces, special chorizo and unique hush puppies.    PLUS, they're pretty close to the airport, so before or after flights means it's always close.  Not sure I get the whole \"foam free\" thing, after all we're in Belmont, NC which isn't exactly anywhere near the cutting edge of the tiny niche green movement.  Just seems like it's adding cost, which ultimately makes their menu a bit more pricey.  I'll be back.  ...So I returned and the experience was just ok.  Was hoping for consistency and they fell short.  I'll still come back when I'm in the area, but likely won't be making any special trips to get there."}
{"text":"Three words...... Get The Wings!!!!!!  And get the sauce on the side. You won't need any.  Best wings ever. Smoked to perfection. Unbelievable flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely some of the best pulled pork I've ever had. We had The Porker and The Tony with Brunswick stew.  The pork tastes delicious without sauce and the hush puppies are great too.  Can't wait to get back here!"}
{"text":"Yep, just like everyone says, great BBQ! Also very friendly service and be sure and try the pie!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food! Friendly Staff! The best BBQ pork is super juicy with no fat all meat!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Their brunch is always delicious, and the service is phenomenal! Everyone who works here is so nice, and makes you feel right at home."}
{"text":"I was very interested with the name and logo of this restaurant before going. I had the pulled pork and it was delicious. I was a little disappointed with portion size. I had the creamed corn with the meal and that portion seemed as big as the meat.   Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  Nice place to enjoy some good BBQ."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place - definitely our go-to pick for barbecue in the area. I have always stuck with my favorite, the pulled pork, and have never been let down! I usually get the side salad which is great, and the slaw is always a perfect addition. And the hush puppies are THE best. Always a pleasure coming in as the staff is super friendly and go above & beyond. Always leave full & happy - would certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"Totally impressive food. We are BBQ snobs so if we liked it, it has to be amazing. Great food in a good atmosphere (casual BBQ style). I had Piglooza breakfast and it was really unique with enough food for two. My husband had brisket and pulled pork and loved it. What a neat find!"}
{"text":"My dad and I had a great time eating at Peace-N-Hominy. We had just arrived in Charlotte after a flight from Providence and this restaurant is very conveniently located close to I-85.    Ambiance:  Peace-N-Hominy had an extraordinarily friendly staff and atmosphere. A staff member helped us understand the menu and told us about all of the sauce options (as well as her favorite sauce combinations). After we got our food, two different employees checked up on us to see how we were enjoying our meals. There were a number of different newspapers to read while you waited. Peace-N-Hominy had very tasteful decorations.   The food:  My dad got a brisket sandwich with coleslaw and I got a pulled chicken sandwich with cheesy grits. Both of us really enjoyed what we got and loved the variety of BBQ sauces that were presented for us to test out. Grits is a dish that we do not often eat in Massachusetts so it was a special treat to have them.   Overall, I would definitely recommend Peace-N-Hominy to anyone looking for a satisfying and delicious meal in a casual and welcoming setting."}
{"text":"My husband found this hidden spot on Yelp when we needed to run an errand in Gastonia and were looking to grab supper on the way.  It's behind the drugstore that's visible, but I've driven this route many times to work and never noticed the restaurant.  It's an unassuming space with a smallish dining area, but turn around seems pretty quick and patrons were moving in and out without wait times while we were eating.  This is an order at the counter and someone brings you your food kind of place, the menu is on the wall by the cash register and specials are listed on a roll of butcher paper that is changed daily.  It includes a Bible verse, which was kinda neat :)  We placed our order with a super helpful woman at the counter and when my husband swiped his card to pay, he was asked if he wanted to leave a tip on the card.  Now, I'm all about tipping for good service...BUT...we hadn't received any service at that point, so it felt a bit odd to be tipping BEFORE we had received our meal or even knew if we'd have a waitress.  An employee/waitress I suppose did bring our meal, but since we were handed our cups to fill ourselves at the drink station/soft drink fountain, the only time we interacted with a waitress was when one came by to take my trash.  Basically it was fast food brought to your table that you tipped someone to bring your food.  It was just strange, and now that we know, we would likely not tip the next time...I genuinely think that it's quite presumptuous to even expect to warrant one in this setting.  Now on to the food...It was actually quite good.  I ordered the turkey sandwich minus the bun (we are doing a low carb weight loss plan right now) and substituted my side of carb heavy options for a salad, minus the corn, tomatoes and croutons that I don't like or can't have on my diet plan.  The honey mustard dressing tasted like bottle Kraft, which is fine, but definitely not homemade.  The turkey was smoked I believe and had great flavor.  I cut it up and put it on my side salad for my meal and it was quite good.  My husband got the Big Porker plate which had pork bbq, bacon and ham and he really liked it.  I tried all 3 meats and aside from the bbq needing salt, I agreed.  He chose the jalapeno slaw and really liked the bit  of  a kick that it had.  The plate comes with hushpuppies, which I have a weakness for , so I did try a bite of one and mmmmmhmmmm good!  A tad sweet, perfectly cooked and oh so yummy!  He selected an apple ale from the drink case and enjoyed it as well.  We would definitely go back if we're in the Belmont/Gastonia direction and try some of the other options.  I am sure this spot is popular with the locals!"}
{"text":"While traveling from Tx to NC  we checked out this little spot thanks to Yelp reviewers. It's a gem of a spot. It's really quaint, clean & the staff is really nice. They had just run out of their pork (which she told me hardly ever happens - lucky me lol) so we didn't get to try it but had the chicken & ribs. They were really great. The real winners were their onion rings that are made on the spot & the jalapeño slaw which was such s great departure from the usual. All in all such a great place. Oh and their BBQ sauces 4 different flavors were all good too.   We took advantage of the checkin coupon and save 10%! We would definitely make a point to stop back in soon!"}
{"text":"This is an unusual restaurant...very unusual, in that they get so many things right.  Don't know where to start!  Love the decor; it's evident that the owners put a lot of thought and time into dressing the restaurant.  Dining room and bathrooms are always clean.  Owners/family have a really great attitude, and are always nice to deal with.  Order accuracy and turn around time is good.  And they're great people...  And then there's the food: there's nothing cheap about the cuts of meat they use; all are delicious.  The chicken is great, and the meat falls right off of the rib bone.  Deliciously smoked.  (Maybe it's because I find their food so good, that I wish their meat portions were a little bigger)  The sides are great too: brunswick stew, beans, cole slaw, puppies...all freshly prepared.  I'd say they're a destination restaurant for sure, and after dinner, downtown Belmont is a great place to have a cup of coffee, or talk a walk in the park."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great pulled pork.  Love the spicy sauce.  The people are so helpful and friendly.  Order online by the plate or by the pound.  Great way to bring dinner home."}
{"text":"Warm friendly staff immediately greeted us and made us feel right at home! Solid Carolina BBQ menu but also a great selection of great burgers too! I ordered the Grocery Salad and the Pulled Pork Sandwich. My wife ordered the P&H burger and if I hadn't of loved my order, I would have been jealous. She shared a bite and it was a seriously good burger. We were stuffed but were convinced by the staff to order dessert. Chocolate pie and banana pudding were best we've tasted. Would recommend to everyone who is hungry and enjoys great food, friendly staff and fun ambiance. We also enjoyed reading the down home words of wisdom that covered the walls!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband love it here! We love there wings! Smoked and great size! I enjoy there jalapeño coleslaw, mac and cheese and ribs as well. Wonderful serivce!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is fantastic! I ordered the big butt burger with fries and hush puppies, and for good measure, a side of mac. The hush puppies were my appetizer on the drive home and they ACTUALLY taste like cornbread rather than just deep fried sugar bread! I was very impressed but it only got better when I popped open the box with the burger. First of all, even after driving home first, the burger looked like a picture. It was gorgeous. The bacon was thick and cooked well but not over cooked and breaking off, the cheese was divine and the bbq? Mmh. My god. It was incredible, y'all. I can't even. The fries were fine and the Mac was waaaay better than it looks. I'll definitely be making this a new go to spot when I'm in Belmont."}
{"text":"The BBQ was high-quality and delicious.  The service was good and I liked the atmosphere too.  A little on the pricey side for BBQ but I don't mind paying a little extra for quality.  I'm looking forward to dining there again."}
{"text":"I Love This Place!!! Never had a bad meal and will always go back. Make sure you try the ribs and brisket. Melts in your mouth goodness."}
{"text":"Peace-n-Hominy has excellent food, friendly service, and a warm family atmosphere.  I highly recommend it!  If you come here once, you WILL come back!!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's all I can say, well actually I can say more and I will! I went here for lunch today with two co-workers, I honestly hadn't heard of this place and today discovered a jewel! It was the best BBQ I've had in a long long time. I had the pulled pork plate and it was amazing. They have four sauces that are homemade, three different kinds of homemade slaw, and lots of home cooked sides! The service is second to none! When I arrived the girl at the register asked if I had been here before, when I told her no, she came out from behind the counter and walked me through the entire menu, specials, and everything I needed to know about everything they made (I noticed they did this with every new person who came in). Also, during our lunch five different people came to check on us to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. On top of all that, the atmosphere was amazing. Felt like a down home mom and pop BBQ joint and the prices were reasonable. There is no doubt I will be back again, and again, and again...."}
{"text":"Very cool little spot in Belmont.  The bbq is generally very good.  Best banana pudding I've ever had.  Sunday brunch is a family favorite.  I can get a big plate of split biscuits with chorizo gravy and a fried egg while the kids slam burgers as big as their face and my wife gets a nice salad.  Service is always friendly.  When the temp is nice, they have some outdoor seating and love well behaved dogs too!"}
{"text":"Had brunch on a Sunday. Great items on menu. Not just bbq items. Had a coffee flavor bar (diy) which is a simple concept, but made my experience that much better. Small place so we had to wait for a table.  Even with that said, would go back again."}
{"text":"Meat was tender, service fantastic. Didn't care for the home style slaw, but I usually don't like slaw. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple of times and every time the food has been delicious! The customer service is A+   The seating situation isn't ideal especially when is cold out because only about 40 people can sit inside. There is outside seating though.  The ribs are awesome (Friday and Saturday) and even better the next day. The 3 amigos sauce is the best, it's a combination of their vinegar, sweet and hit BBQ sauce.  I've been once for brick and the scramble is something worth trying.   This visit here I'm going with he yard bird because I'm cutting down on the carbs but if now the hushpuppies are good. It was recommended to dip it in the Brunswick stew which adds an extra flair to the sweet bread balls of flavor."}
{"text":"This little BBQ joint is very cool and welcoming. But this review is specifically about their baby back ribs. They were AMAZING. They only have them Friday and Sat usually but we got them on special. They were fall off the bone delicious. Got them with creamed corn which was also great. My boyfriend got the brisket with chili Mac and we both finished our whole meals."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it! Love the food, the people, the prices, the ambience. I highly recommend it! Tasty, yummy BBQ. I get something different every time. It's all good."}
{"text":"This place serves up a nice variety of barbecue and sides, along with other items. They have pork, brisket, bacon, turkey and chicken barbecue. The pork and chicken are our current favorites. Be sure to try the stew as a side, it is really good as well. The interior is nicely done, they have made the small space very welcoming."}
{"text":"Cute ambiance and great food! It's a small little place but it packs lots of flavors. The pulled pork sandwich is fantastic!"}

{"text":"So good! I want to rave about the salad because rarely do you find a really great kale and spinach salad and not only was theirs great, they make their own dressing!! I want to go back purely for that. I'm not a big barbecue person but the pulled chicken was very good as well and the hush puppies were great!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me to give this place a try next time I'm in the area. So glad I took their advice. This is a small restaurant with a small town family vibe and old school charm. The staff was super friendly and eager to help with picking from menu since I'd never been there before. Overall the customer service was superb! I got the brisket which was very tender and absolutely delicious. It was one of the most expensive sandwiches on the menu but worth every penny. I also sampled the pulled chicken which was awesome! Wish this place was closer to my home so I can visit more often. I would love to try out their breakfast menu too. Give this place a try and I'm sure you will love it too!"}
{"text":"Brought a team of 11 here on our way back from Student Leadership Conference! Food was great! Staff was great! We will be back."}
{"text":"It couldn't have been better if I cooked it myself! Being from Eastern North Carolina I am particularly adept at cooking Que, but this joint made my lips smack with tender meat, great sauces, incredible sides and a topping of down home hospitality! Do not miss this hidden gem if your passing anywhere near Belmont!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, friendly staff, good sauces on the tables, quick service....even for our party of 10."}
{"text":"Excellent food and one of the best key lime and chocolate pies I believe I have ever tasted! Polite helpful staff with cozy ambience."}
{"text":"Peace 'n Hominy is one of my favorites! It's definitely my go-to for weekend brunch. First, the food. At this point, I've got my \"usual\"- the peach W.I.T griddle toast with french fries and bacon. I'm not a big fan of potatoes, so I usually choose french fries over hashbrowns. I've also had the biscuits and gravy, which were really delicious, coming from someone who doesn't like white gravy! The coop poutine was yummy too, just a little bit of sweetness to the brown gravy to balance out all that savory egg and fries and bbq goodness. That being said, all of the portions are generous; if you leave hungry, it's your own fault! There are plenty of drink options from the case or the soda fountain, and they let you doctor your coffee however you please with fancy syrups.   The atmosphere there is great, very friendly and casual. They've got fun coloring pages for the kids, and lots of quirky decorative signs. The wait staff are attentive and pleasant, and at this point, they recognize me and my typical order. Odd though it may seem to include in a review, the bathrooms are convenient and spacious. I can only speak for the women's, but there's plenty of space to take kids in with you, maneuver a wheelchair, or assist someone with special needs. The porch is lovely as long as the weather cooperates. On the whole, a solid choice for a friendly, casual meal."}
{"text":"Very good pork plate,  good baked beans.  Casual atmosphere.  Love the decor.  Very friendly, helpful service."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We came shopping at Catawba Antique mall and needed lunch!! Great BBQ! Coleslaw is awesome!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So, was returning to my car after completing business in an unfamiliar neighborhood, and had my nostrils assailed by delight.  I literally followed my nose to their smoker and discovered this gem.  It promises to become one of my local favorites (and will soon be adding a weekend breakfast menu!). It's an indie owner operation which deserves our support for their entrepreneurial spirit, and even more for their outstanding BBQ!  Clean, friendly and worth finding in Belmont.  When you want (NEED) BBQ, you need Peace N Hominy!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! When I travel I'm always in search of great BBQ, and I found it here! The brisket was so tender it melted in my mouth, the sauce was perfectly sweet, and the hush puppies had a sweetness to them that I've never tasted in a hushpuppy before. After my meal (which I never wanted to end) I decided to take some banana pudding to go. The plan was to eat it later that night, well that plan failed. I ate the entire container in the car - it was perfectly creamy, and topped off a great meal.   I don't write reviews very often, but when I do it's because the meal was exceptional. This was exceptional BBQ. I wish we had BBQ like this in the Northeast but, alas.... it just means I need to take another trip to NC ;)"}
{"text":"I thank you Yelpers for rating this place outside Charlotte on a trip west.  It was easy to find from the airport and highway and hit the spot.  Really good sauces for the pulled pork and brisket and the sides for the plates were a nice touch.  It was exactly what we were looking for and it absolutely hit the spot.  Very high recommend."}
{"text":"Peace-N-Hominy is one of those perfect, down home, hole-in-the-wall gems that you just have to love! From the whimsical butcher paper menu & paper straws to the homey decor & insanely sweet staff, it just feels comfortable and delightful.  I've tried quite a few things at Peace-N-Hominy and have been there for lunch and dinner (breakfast/brunch is on my must do list though!) The BBQ's great, burgers are traditional pharmacy-style treats, and hushpuppies & fries are perfection! And there's Cheerwine (in a glass bottle AND fountain--SWOON!) My only letdown was the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese is unlike any I've had before with semi-cheesy, warm noodles in a cup with cold, shredded cheese tossed on top. It looked intriguing but was bland and, once the cold cheese was mixed in, rather cold & unusual! Just wasn't for me!  My only reason for a 4 star rating as opposed to 5 is simply consistency. I've had meals before that were positively perfect & wonderful and then I've had some where my burger was charred & the food just wasn't great! I think part of it was likely just timing. When I've been and it's less crowded, the food has been best! When it's been insanely busy (like Sundays after church), the food has come up a little lacking. With such a small restaurant, it could simply be a matter of being overwhelmed when it's crazy busy. The good experiences definitely outweigh the bad though and I'll definitely be back but hope to see more consistency in the quality going forward!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Very friendly staff! The best place in Belmont to eat for sure! It's small so sometimes it can get hard to find somewhere to eat during lunch time. But for a good reason. I would rather wait for a seat and have good food than be at a place that is completely empty. I wish I still worked so close."}
{"text":"Great food. The BBQ brisket is amazing. Nice little cozy place a friendly staff. They also serve an amazing breakfast on weekends only."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say! Came for brunch and it was amazing. Had the French toast and bacon. I wanted to unhinge my jaw and eat it all at once!! Atmosphere is fun country. If I lived here I would be back a lot."}
{"text":"I was in town and found this place on Yelp. The raving reviews are true and on point. Greeted right away upon entering by super friendly employees. The lady at the register gave me some ideas and what are the best selling items. I settled on brisket, jalapeño slaw and cheese grits. Everything was awesome!   I like the decor of the restaurant too.   I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"What a find!  Cute bbq place adorned with crayon coloring of pigs, tucked into a mini strip mall.  Hurry over for dinner because they close at 8. The brisket was tender and tasty and the service was friendly and made you feel like family.  Sides were good (but not as standout as the brisket)"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this out for breakfast one weekend and had a pleasant experience. As a vegetarian, I wish there were more options for my diet, but my husband thought the menu was great. They even gave me two free tacos because I ordered two egg and bean tacos, not realizing the beans had pork in them. The place has beer and a neat atmosphere too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. I was expecting great BBQ from the reviews but it wasn't.   I had the 3 meat plate with pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket. The meat was bland with hardly any seasoning and the brisket did not have the smoke ring you look for in brisket.  The mark of good BBQ is how good the meat is before you add their sauce and this meat did not meet the mark.  Positives: The staff was friendly and helpful, the hushpuppies were amazing and the sauce that I had (vinegeratte based) was good."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I don't live very far from it. I got the pulled pork with the original q sauce, bourbon baked beans and hush puppies. The pulled pork is good but I think it needs more seasoning. The baked beans and the hush puppies were good. I love the bread and butter pickles. I will go back and try other things on their menu. I may give the wings a try since there have been many good reviews about their wings."}
{"text":"Seriously the best bbq. I've never had anything I don't like here. Everything they make is homemade. I don't have a favorite because it's all so good. I always try to something new each time. Mrs. Christine will bend over backwards to make you feel like family. She is seriously the best."}
{"text":"Belmont is a great historical town with wonderful quaint architecture! This places fits right in, connected to the Belmont Drug Store. The inside is small but outdoor seating is available and the taste is LARGE!!! From 6-cheese smoked Mac to fried pickles, homemade chips, and tasty jalapeño slaw, the menu is broad but delicious meats as well! Great find for family dinner. Kid and pup friendly and lots of parking! Customer service is top"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. This place is total perfection. Very small town feel. Good prices, great food, big portions, and the staff is wonderful. Can't wait to try the BBQ for dinner!"}
{"text":"Outstanding barbecue restaurant in North Carolina. They do a wonderful job on both a pulled pork sandwich as well as the brisket. I am very picky about brisket and theirs rivals the famous Coopers Bbq in Fort Worth Texas. They also do it very nice rendition of hush puppies."}
{"text":"I stopped early on Saturday to try their breakfast as my 1st time visit.  The place was empty except for a couple finishing their meal.  I sat down waiting for a waitress . . . waiting . . . waiting.  The friendly couple finally explained it is counter order only, but no one there, either.  I stood at the counter and finally flagged down a worker out in the kitchen.  I ordered a basic meal, nothing fancy.  It was good but noteworthy? No.  The restaurant is superbly decorated and whimsical.  Everything about the place suggested I must have caught them yawning in a time warp.  So, I decided to return for dinner same day.  What a difference!  The restaurant was bustling and noisy and in its zone.  The staff was friendly and dressed in clean, bright red tees (the morning shift's attire was disheveled and not in uniform).  Christine, the owner greeted me and was obviously driving the place to hit on all cylinders.  I like that.  I ordered take-out wings with 3 Amigos sauce (very good and the wings kept their moisture for leftovers next day); plus, a plate of brisket (undressed with sauce on the side) and mac-n-cheese.  The brisket was tasty and smoky; I just wanted more of it.  It weighed in at 5.72 ounces (see pic), which I thought for $11.95 was skimpy.  The MnC was overcooked and mushy--not a do-over.  I liked the honey infused hushpuppies, too.  An unexpected taste.  My experience was overall positive.  I am glad I returned.  The food was overall very good, the decor spot-on, and the location perfect.  If I lived closer I'd have another Dukedom in which to find me in!"}
{"text":"We love this little restaurant!  The brunch food is unique and SO good.  I'm usually a huge fan of pulled pork but I don't particularly like theirs.  If we go for dinner we usually get burgers since they have amazing ones!  Creamed corn, chili mac and baked beans are our favorite sides.  We will be back often. :)"}
{"text":"If you haven't found this place, you are missing out. The French toast is amazing! Their brisket has the right amount of smoke flavor and it is moist and tender. You can't go wrong with anything you order. The staff is the best, always a smile and ready to answer your questions and make suggestions."}
{"text":"Delicious southern brunch! Apple butter pancakes were on point! Def will be back and will try their lunch next time."}
{"text":"After a long morning of travel we were delighted to find Peace-N-Hominy fairly near the Airport. We walked into an incredibly welcoming place- we immediately felt the hospitality that defines the service we encountered throughout our visit. Each staff member we interacted with showed warmth, attentiveness to our needs, and joy.   The food was also very good!   We had a three meat sampler with onion rings, wings, two types of coleslaw, and extra hush puppies. The boys split a corn dog with fries.   The wings were incredible- a nice fruit-wood smoke, and very juicy (I'm guessing they're brined before smoking?). The skin was wonderful and they dust them with some salt with a touch of sugar in it. We got them with the sauce on the side and I would recommend doing the same. Their ranch and blue cheese are homemade and amazing. (I don't usually comment on the blue cheese, but it was surprisingly good).   The three meat plate we ordered included their bacon (order this) their pulled pork (very good) and their Brisket (our only disappointment).  The bacon strips were decadent and worth trying. Again- fruit wood Smokey, sweet, salty and fatty. Amazing. Pulled Pork was quiet good and made a great vehicle to try their four sauces: original (sweet, but not cloying), spicy (but not blazing hot) Carolina vinegar , and then one that is all three mixed up. Our favorite was the original. The brisket was disappointing, but I think we are ruined on brisket because no one comes close to Texas style, which is what we are always hoping for.   The Jalapeño Coleslaw was awesome.   The hushpuppies were also very good especially because they were covered in their sweet and salty dust.   Ok this is too long. Eat here, it's good."}
{"text":"We were driving through the area looking at houses and we stumbled across this little restaurant. My fiancé wanted something \"local\" so we stopped and never expected the pleasant surprise we received. From the outside entrance and parking in the back you cannot even tell there is a restaurant. From the moment we walked in the service was amazing. Jaime greeted us with a cheerful and pleasant smile which began by asking if we had eaten there before. When we told her no, she explained that the menu was on the wall and we should order the food first. We shared a mixed plate which had wings, pulled pork and brisket. Wow! the wings we ordered plain and I am so glad we did. They were juicy and tasty with the reg rub that is used. The other meats were equally yummy. They had 3 or 4 sauces, but I chose the one that was a blend of all three. also, amazing. I had a nice beer from their wide selection and some jalapeño cole slaw. Initially I thought I would not like it until Jaime said it was her favorite so I tried it. Boy am I glad I did. Everything was so good I opted to have dessert. They had a banana pudding that was wonderful and a specialty pie that was called a butter pecan pie. When asked what it tasted like I was asked... Have you ever eaten butter pecan ice cream? I said yes and sure enough that is exactly what it tasted like. At one point we had the opportunity to meet Kristine the owner. What a grand slam to bring an end to an amazing meal with some of the friendliest people you will ever meet. Prices are great. Food is great. If traveling through Charlotte or going to the river... you wont want to miss this little.. out of the way... local restaurant that is truly one of a kind. Thank you to Kristine and Jaime!! Ana and I will certainly return for more of your southern hospitality. :))"}
{"text":"Wow what a great little place! Personal touch on great BBQ,  along with the traditional favorites. Mix that with excellent service and  cleanliness,  and you have an absolutely wonderful place to eat!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, excellent service.  A neat location in Belmont.  The slaw and beans were very good.  I plan to come back to try the other meats on the menu.  The pulled pork was good."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food.  Comfortable, relaxed, homey atmosphere.  Super impressed with this place!  All homemade, fresh food.  Customer service is top notch!  Really enjoyed our meals and the friendly, attentive staff!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Peace N Hominy a few times and wanted to try a variety of things before making a review. I have tried a variety of the meats and found them all quite dry. I have never had something as greasy as pork be so dry so I had to use ample bbq sauce with they have a few flavors that are ok. My favorite was probably the turkey although my sister said her burger was very good.    So this place is close and could probably be a decent burger joint but they nickle and dime you for any extra toppings and \"premium\" sides. Since when are fries premium?     I tried the tacos they were different not bad but not great either and again with the nickle and dime for any toppings. The set up is not designed very well. The only full menu is right at the register and there is often a crowd trying to see what they want to eat so it can take some time to even be able to order. They started using wooden utensils also with do not work well.   The brunch is pretty good I will say though. The griddle cakes are great but I didn't really care for some of their specialty breakfast plates.   But the last visit will be the last time I will be eating there.  Right after paying for my meal my wife points to the wall where the bottle cap remover is and there is a roach. Not a palmeto bug but a nasty german roach in the middle of the day climbing up the wall. I realize this type of thing can happen at restaurants but this place is far to pricey to have roaches climbing up the wall in plain view. Talk about an appetite killer."}
{"text":"So excited to find this gem hidden in the heart of Belmont. Such a warm and friendly atmosphere. It's a little tight but good amount of seats for the size. The food was delicious.  My husband is very picky about his ribs and was very impressed. Their made in house sauces are so yummy. Even my kids were pleased so this barbecue loving family will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm not sure WHY it took me so long to try this place, but it's now one of my favorite restaurants to grab a bite to eat in Belmont. Peace N Hominy serves up both terrific BBQ and the friendliest service -- what's not to love?  Located in East Belmont, the restaurant has a cozy, homey feel. Upon arrival, staff warmly greet you and ask if you have any questions about the menu. Like most BBQ joints, you order food at the cash register and then find a table.   The menu here is quite comprehensive and they serve a variety of smoked meats such as brisket, pulled pork, bacon, chicken, and turkey. My favorite meats are the pulled pork and brisket -- both are super tender and full of smoky flavor. They also have a nice selection of side dishes, featuring a solid coleslaw, slightly sweet hush puppies, and creamy grits. I wasn't a huge fan of the macaroni and cheese (basically pasta + shredded cheese), but you can't go wrong with any of their other side dishes. They have a nice selection of BBQ sauces, ranging from vinegar-based (my favorite) to traditional to spicy. I haven't been crazy about the desserts I've tried here, but that's okay, because I rarely have room for dessert after eating a delicious plate of BBQ!   The service here is top-notch! The staff are genuinely kind and friendly and truly exemplify Southern hospitality! Thank you so much for adding such a great restaurant to the Belmont food scene!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times. Never disappointed. Great place to have a late  lunch after visiting the antique mall across the street."}
{"text":"So the prices are still too high and the quality has gone down.  The first couple of times we visited, the brisquit was great.  Since then it has gotten tougher and less flavorful.  Also, many of the pieces were mostly fat.  The pulled pork has also gotten worse, now comparable or worse than local bbq chains at a higher price.  Save your money and head to hillbillys or lancasters."}
{"text":"Stopped in Friday night for dinner.  I had the brisket and it was fantastic.  Husband had the ribs and they were good as well.  The hushpuppies are awesome.  We also had baked beans, bbq slaw and french fries.  All were delicious.  It was our first visit but won't be our last."}
{"text":"20 minutes before closing we were greeted with a smile, welcome and excitement by a pleasant server named Jamie.  She was excited to find out that it was our first time there and took time to help us navigate their many menu options to choose from. While the first impression was excellent the food was even better. Brisket was so tender and flavorful, KC Sammy (barbecue sandwich with a twist) was delicious and the footlong corn dog was awesome!  The portions were plentiful and the sauce options fit all of our tastes. We never felt rushed even though it was after closing time. Service 5, Food 5, Experience 5.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Overall good stop. Prices fair. Just had the chicken sandwich and cream corn. Wife had pork sandwich and bourbon beans."}
{"text":"Love this place. Eat food from here at least once a week. The specials are great, the 3 Amigos sauce is incredible, awesome sides, and a great atmosphere all at a great price. Really good for breakfast on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Very clean interior and quick service. Daily specials are quite a good pickup. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of beans and mac & cheese. Meat on the sandwich was tasty and there was plenty of it. The bun itself was fairly standard but still very good. The beans were excellent! Much recommended. Mac &  cheese could have been creamier but it was still good. The size of the sides was adequate for their price.   Overall I would encourage a stop at this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious smoked turkey sandwich w/ slaw & 3 amigos bbq sauce. Nice variety on menu - hot dogs, hamburgers, barbecue, weekend brunch. Mac n Cheese lacked good cheese flavor"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, service is great with attentive and friendly servers.  Cute little set up."}
{"text":"Love this place so much that I made sure to go twice, en route from Asheville to Charlotte! Service is wonderful, and food as fantastic!  Over my two times there, I've had: chicken wings, mac & cheese, hush puppies, and a pulled chicken sandwich.  Their barbecue (the original) is incredible- sweet & delicious. If they had jars, I would have purchased some to take back with me on the plane to NJ.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!  Tips:  Order at counter Try off-peak times. Gets crowded."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and there is not enough room in this box for me to tell you why. If you can't stand your brisket smoked 17 hours you should never go. If you hate tender BBQ, and ribs that you can't pick up and eat because the bones fall out, you should never go. Look if you live anywhere near this place and you haven't been get out from under that rock and go get you something tender, I know that rocks been hard on ya"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and the service and food is always top notch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yelp has never steered me wrong! This place has a wonderful atmosphere of peace, love, and good values. Their food is exceptionally well priced for the fantastic quality they serve. Service was wonderful! Friendly atmosphere! As well, the restroom was super clean and had refreshing and uplifting Scripture on the wall. I thoroughly loved this restaurant. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. The food was amazing! Completely worth the high rating. Good prices and quantity of food. Creative menu. Splendid craft beer selection. (But they also have Bud for the less adventurous folk). I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really great food in a fun atmosphere.  Busy when we were there, but well worth the short wait."}
{"text":"The wait was long for the amount of people, but the breakfast was worth it, in my opinion. It's one of the few brunch options in Belmont on the weekends."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place after seeing that another brunch place in Belmont had a long wait. We are really happy that we did. Despite being obviously new customers and looking obviously overwhelmed by the menu, the host explained their extensive menu in a way that was almost Oscar worthy. The food tasted homemade and delicious. Happy to support a small business and would return if ever back in the area."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I finished up.  OMG,  fantastic.  Being from up north the food was awesome.  The staff was so friendly and knowing this was my 1st time here explain the menu and accommodated a change I requested.  This is a must go is you love BBQ..."}
{"text":"Ok so I was a little worried going here because it has been many things and I am picky about BBQ.   I don't know how there are so many 5* reviews. It has be be friends and family.   Three of us went there today for lunch and had hoped for the best. We got some of the worst we have had.   One gentleman got a burger and it was made totally different than the sign said. It didn't have half the stuff on it it was supposed to. He said the burger tasted as those they are frozen and no where near fresh. It didn't have a good color to it at all. He said his onion rings were ok.   The other gentleman got a pulled pork plate with jalapeño slaw and onion rings. He liked the slaw. The onion rings were way over cooked and not edible.  He said the pork was not the best and would not get it again. No real flavor but was tender.   I got the pork plate with stew. I am a huge lover of Brunswick stew and this is by far the  worst stew I have had. It needs a lot of work. Almost tasted like veg-all out of a can. The pork I got was not good either. While tender it just didn't taste like anything. I had to smother it in sauce.   The water also taste really bad. I don't drink soda or sweet tea and the water out of the machine taste pretty dang nasty.   Sorry for the bad review but it is just the truth. Will not go back and will not recommend."}
{"text":"This location has been many things and I hope this one stays.  Good food at affordable Prices.  Try the smoked Bacon.  Burgers are OK But def go for the Pulled Pork, Pulled Chicken and Bacon.  Hush Puppies are Yummy but you only get two."}
{"text":"I've eaten here around twelve times now and will keep coming back.  Their service, specials and FOOD make this place quite the gem.  The brisket is so juicy and full of flavor with the perfect amount of fat.  Great sides, good sauce and please try their salad with the homemade ranch dressing.  I'm normally not a ranch guy, so me telling you to get ranch says it must be divine!  The textures and flavors in their salad will definitely excite your tastebuds and leave you wanting more.  Please, if you go on a Friday or Saturday night leave me some ribs!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love the people, food, service! The ribs were fantastic! The bbq sandwich was off the charts! Kids loved the mac and cheese. We will go back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty small! It was super hard to find seating for just two people. You walk up to a register, order your food, pick out your own drink from a cooler, then seat yourself. There is minimal staff to customer interaction. I wish there was at least someone to seat people since there were people of two sitting at large tables, when you could see a family of 4-6 struggling to sit somewhere. The food was SO good though. The Mac n cheese had a Smoky flavor throughout. I have never had anything like it. The slaw was tasty. There were different homemade barbecue sauces that were delicious. Maybe next time we will order to go because of the seating situation."}
{"text":"If you're looking for breakfast/brunch options in Belmont, this is one of the only ones. I discovered that on a Sunday morning when I didn't want to drive into Charlotte. Peace-N-Hominy had been recommended to me by my dearest old man (see if you can spot his review!) and I was really looking forward to giving it a shot. Honestly, if you're looking for a healthy option, this might not be the best choice, but if you're not in the mood to count calories, order it all! They've got a small by southernly inviting shop with wooden accents and scripture verses all over the walls (definitely home-town-southern feel). I honestly don't LOVE the layout. It's a little cramped and you have to wait in line to order while looking at the menu on the wall that looks to have been designed more for graphic appeal then actual customers (the fonts are hard to read from a distance and it's just a lot of color and texture). We also had a long time getting everything keyed into the Ipad to order, good in theory, but slow if the waiter is learning or maybe not technology savvy.   We ordered the W.I.T. Hotcakes with bacon and the B.E.L.T. plus two coffees. I'd highly recommend SKIPPING the coffee. I can drink just about anything and this was just undrinkable. Plus, if you want \"iced coffee\" they provide you with a cup of ice to pour the hot coffee over. I know we're in a small town, so you're not going to get the big city amenities, but honestly, it'd be better in my opinion if they didn't even offer it. Both the meals were good, home cooked southern food. I loved the pimento cheese on the BLT take and the peach sauce on the pancakes was sweet and tangy. I'd skip the biscuits next time. Honestly, nothing was bad, it just wasn't something I'd return for. I WILL visit again for the BBQ, I think that's where they might shine more (I mean that bacon they served was awesome!) and really am looking forward to another visit next time I'm visiting dear old papa bear."}
{"text":"This is a unique, family owned place! It is not the run of the mill barbecue menu that you can find on every other street in the south. This is high quality food with fresh ingredients and a creative flair that makes their menu items interesting and flavorful. I love the fact that recycled paper products are used. This restaurant is extremely clean and the owners are kind, happy people who are there daily and take pride in excellent customer service. I love the smoked wings, chili mac, ribs, brisket. It's all good!"}
{"text":"Great barbeque! Had the pulled pork sandwich, cheese grits and a smoked  chorizo. It was delicious.  Local owners wityh a great restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a typical small southern town BBQ place.  It is fine for what it is but not great for what it could be.  Is there better BBQ nereby yes.  Is there worse yes.  A unique location with ok food."}
{"text":"Peace N Hominy has easily became one of my favorite places to get BBQ, the food is absolutely to die for! However, I've started to fall into taking it to go rather than eating there. The indoor seating isn't awful, it just fills up very quick. The outdoor seating is beautiful, but the fly infestation is a bit of a problem! There seems to be a few tools they are using to condense the fly amount, however it's not working. It makes it extremely difficult to enjoy anything whenever you have 8-15 flies swarming around you and landing on your food constantly. I do understand that it is an outdoor area, however, I feel as if there should be steps taken to reduce that amount of fly flow. Outside of that, Peace N Hominy has an amazing staff, amazing food, and I'll be looking forward to being able to enjoy it outdoors on their amazing patio area one day!"}
{"text":"This food!!!! It is oh so good. I have lived in NC all my life and eaten a lot of BBQ. The pork BBQ here is in my top two favorites of all time. We love to eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The service is as great as the food."}
{"text":"Wow. What an amazing experience. This place is legit. Some of the best. We were with a small group and we all got something g different. Every item was insane. The brisket rival Texas brisket. The chicken and pork were on point. The bacon and chorizo were out of bounds.  I highly recommend this place. The customer service was awesome."}
{"text":"Food was great and staff was very accommodating for gluten-free options.  We visited on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm service was friendly and fast.  Brisket and pulled pork with the homemade onion rings and banana pudding were fantastic.    Atmosphere was nice  - cozy and quiet.  It was refreshing to go to a restaurant where you could actually hear each other talk,"}
{"text":"Solid place but not out of this world.  The grits were watery and blah- skip them.  I had the pulled pork and loved it! My husband had the brisket which was average.  Good but not the best you'll ever have.  I really liked the jalapeño slaw and the hush puppies were fantastic!   Cute environment and friendly service.  Solid but won't knock your socks off."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  Great food.  They certainly know what they are doing and we will be back!  Try the Tony and homemade potato salad.  We also got the hush puppies .  You will not be disappointed.  Super clean and fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"We love to eat at local places when we travel and this great little restaurant was exactly why!  My family split a pound of pulled pork, mac and cheese, baked beans, coleslaw, onion rings, brunswick stew, and hush puppies. The pork was so good it didn't need any sauce, although the 3 sauces provided were very good. The baked beans had a great sweet flavor to them and the mac and cheese was delicious and smokey(my kids devoured it so fast that I barely got a bite).  The onion rings and hush puppies were fried to perfection.  The onion rings were a great balance of breading and onion that stayed together throughout the whole ring.    The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  An Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place!  Stopped in Belmont to get gasoline and have lunch. Instead of the usual fast food fare, we read about this adorable place on Yelp. The high ratings are spot on. A little out of the way but less than two miles from the interstate, some might say it's a hole in the wall place. It's charming and clean inside, and you're greeted by heavenly smells. We just beat the Sunday lunch crowd but when we left there was a line out the door. They were working to quickly take orders for those in line. My husband got a pulled pork plate which came with slaw, baked beans and hush puppies. I ordered the Catawba dog with a side of fries. Our food came out reasonably fast, was freshly prepared, and was so delicious. Everyone who worked there was so friendly. Will make a point of stopping by again when we're traveling by."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place. Our family, including my 5 year old enjoyed the food and environment. Offered her a coloring page and that kept her quite occupied. 4 instead of 5 stars only because the inside is pretty small, seems to have a pretty quick turnaround time for each table but when all the tables were full it felt very full and almost overwhelming. Overall great food and nice employees."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Visiting from out of town and was looking for some good NC barbeque. Was not disappointed, with a few minor comments. First,  the meats were incredible. We had pulled pork, brisket and chicken. Loved the 3 amigo sauce. The cheesy grits were, well, grits with cheese on top. Nothing to write home about about. The slaw was just ok. My receipt is way better, but maybe its a matter of taste would definitely try again and take a look at the other sides. All in all, a good value. They might consider adding fried okra and fried green beans,  two of my favorites."}
{"text":"So I sold a car and was flush with cash-always a good thing, right?  Anyway, since we moved from New York, we've done all of our banking online including check deposits. We don't really deal in much cash.  The nearest branch of my New York bank was in Fort Mill, South Carolina. After gassing up for $1.839/gallon, I reached the bank and made the deposit.  It was near lunchtime so I popped open the Yelp app on my iPhone as I'd done many times before. Punched in BBQ because, well, BBQ. I was looking for my old standby, Old Hickory House Restaurant in Charlotte. Well up pops an ad for Peace-N-Hominy Q Shack.   I've had mixed results with Yelp ads but I decide to take a shot-it seems new and there are only 9 reviews-all but 1 was positive. I saw that the brisket was good (I love all smoked meats and brisket is a favorite).   I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of hushpuppies and a bottle of Cheerwine.  I asked for hot sauce, it came out with a big bottle.   Took a bite of the sandwich and was amazed at the fat cap on the brisket-it melted with each bite. There was a good smoke ring and the hot sauce wasn't that hot for my taste-but it was delicious. Nota Bene: I've been known to drink Buffalo Wing sauce to check if it's spicy enough....  Anyway back to the sandwich-served on a soft, fresh burger bun, it was outstanding, They did offer to put lettuce, tomato or whatever on it, but I wanted to try it standalone. The hushpuppies are my favorite ball shaped ones (hey now) rivaled only by BBQ Joe's in High Point, NC.   Service was great and the place has rolls of paper towels on the table (points) and is well decorated and immaculately clean. Now I'm okay with a hole-in-the-wall BBQ place but this was very warm and welcoming.  It is clear they put a lot of thought into this place and take their BBQ seriously.   I gave it 5 stars as it earned it-and my 9 year old son agreed--I brought some back for him for dinner. He plowed through it and usually hates fat on any meat-but loved this.  I will go back, with family in tow, and hope it lives up to the 5 stars. I will definitely try some other items on the menu.  If I have 1, minor gripe, it was definitely on the high end of pricing. A sandwich was $9.99 and a platter $11.99. I'm used to Triad pricing. In fairness, they are new and this is a quality product. They do not skimp on portions-but just a bit of sticker shock. Also this would be a $15-20 sandwich in New York.  Side note-another 2 people were in and said they saw the ad on Yelp and came in to try."}
{"text":"Small venue but has outside seating. This place is so worth it though, the food is incredible and the service is great and friendly, it is also kid friendly which is a huge plus. Everything I have tried is so good. The wings, the BBQ, chicken, hamburgers and the hot dog as well as the breakfast"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and so much of it! We went for breakfast after a weekend of whitewater rafting, the perfect comfort food to fuel us. The service was super friendly. Two of us got the Southern Comfort (giant biscuits biscuits with pulled pork and chorizo gravy), one got the WIT apple butter pancakes and one got the cheesy grits with eggs and sweet hushpuppies. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp! The fella and I needed a breakfast spot on our way out of Charlotte, so I did a little searching, and we settled on Peace N Hominy (mostly because of the ratings, but I also loved the name!).   We got there around 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, and we thought it was closed at first since there were no other cars in the lot. That changed by the time we left! The nicest cashier/waitress in the world met us as we walked in and asked if we'd been there before. When we said we hadn't, she walked us through the deeelicious sounding menu printed from floor to ceiling on the wall. Too cute.   The fella and I decided on the 6-pack of breakfast tacos and got 2 with bacon, 2 with chorizo, and 2 with sausage (and all with cheese - of course). I got a coffee, he got a water, and it was a steal at $19. They had all kinds of syrups you could put in your self-serve coffee, too.  The atmosphere is so quaint and down home with signs that your grandma might have hanging around. This is a gem of a place!"}
{"text":"We are here from Texas and this place has amazing bbq. The pulled pork melts in your mouth. The bourbon baked beans were sweet and tasted - just the way I like them. The homemade chips were crispy and delicious. We are here for only three days but we are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Just tried this wonderful place tonight!  We are SO glad we did!  I ordered a burger which was delicious!  And my husband ordered brisket and pulled pork. He loved it!  The hush puppies are very good as well!  This is definitely going to be one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing kale spinach salad was to die for. I am vegetarian but the two amazing people that I'm here with enjoyed the coleslaw and the bourbon beans as well as the brisket and pulled pork we're tender and juicy. And the Apple Crisp was lick the plate awesome!! All in all everything was slap your mama good!"}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast. I know you are saying, \"WHAT? a BBQ joint for breakfast\" but they have a pretty extensive menu for the early riser. Why the three stars, the service was horrible. The person taking orders did not know how to use the system or make change($), the menu is difficult to read and service as terribly slow for eggs and breakfast fare. The menu is posted on a wall next to the register so as you are standing in line to order you have to try to over the shoulder of the person in front of you. This makes for an awkward situation and you don't really know what to order until you are in-front of the line and then you slow down the process for everyone else. What was good you ask? The food. What we had for breakfast was all tasty except for the cheese grits. These were served to us cold. They were so cold that the cheese the cook put on the top didn't even melt. The server never asked us if anything was wrong when we left the entire dish uneaten. Food is served on paper plates BBQ joint style. There are a variety of BBQ sauces on the table and the Original Q is delicious! We will try again but maybe phone-in an order ahead."}
{"text":"This is such a unique place tucked away in Belmont! I went for breakfast and had the coop poutine it was delicious chicken on top of hash browns and eggs covered with chicken gravy and cheese! They have so many unique dishes you really need to go every week for the weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Great food and casual atmosphere.  A definite must in a growing culinary scene in Belmont."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint!!!  We had a brisket plate and a chicken plate.  The meat is moist and perfectly cooked.  Sauce on the side if you want it.  My husband thought the brisket was perfectly smoked and flavorful and passed on adding sauce.  I enjoyed the opportunity to try a variety of sauces.  The hush puppies are special, a little sweet, and compliment the spicy sauces perfectly.  (next time we will order extra!)   We also had chili mac and jalepeno slaw.    Best of all, we were able to order and pay online, specify the pick up time, and boom... done. Worked perfectly for us to stop in pick up the meal and head to our next stop.  very user friendly.  The portions were generous and provided leftovers for another meal. Definately worthy of a repeat!  soon!"}
{"text":"The best pulled pork or pulled chicken in Gaston County. Add Tonua's smiling face and friendly service, and it truly is a place of Peace 'n Hominy!"}
{"text":"The 4 Stars alone go towards their friendly attitude and very helpful service. The young lady literally walked from behind the counter to explain the menu to us and answer any of our questions.    I had been looking at their menu throughout the day so I knew I'd be ordering their pork sandwich w/ Mac&Cheese. The pork sandwich was good, it could have been served a bit warmer but it was a good pork sandwich. The MAC & Cheese was disappointing, sprinkled with shredded cheese on top it did not represent southern Mac & Cheese at all!     The pork platter which comes with hush puppies, slaw and 1 side and a drink was a great bargain and was also good. The fries were awesome! REAL fries if you know what I mean! The hush puppies are sprinkled with brown sugar and give it a nice flavor. They have plenty of soda pop options to include Cheerwine which is a cherry flavored soft drink produced right here in NC since 1917, yum!    To end our lunch I took home a banana pudding which was so delicious and so fresh I regret not buying more!   The only reason they're not a 5 in my opinion is because of the weak Mac & Cheese, it should be cheesier and baked with breadcrumbs!"}
{"text":"Have never been inpressed.  The food is served in baskets.  Lots of disposable stuff for holding and eating food.  Portions are small in my opinion.  Meats are generally dry and need more seasoning or something.  2nd tier BBQ is my opinion."}
{"text":"Can you say new favorite!..... amazing, awesome, perfect!.... as a former BBQ judge, i love it here!..... , nice folks, great food, cool place."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while in town for business; recommendation from the hotel front desk staff.   Ordered the two meat plate with beef brisket, pulled pork, bbq slaw, cheesy grits and side of beans. The Beef brisket was delicious, really good flavor, would go back to order this again! The pork was overall just ok, a little on the dry side. If you are not a fan of sweet grits, do not order them! They add some type of sweet corn to them and only add shredded cheese on top. The hush puppies were also good. Baked beans just average as well."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The atmosphere is cozy both inside and outside. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"We found this BBQ on Yelp after landing in Charlotte from NH ! We were NOT disappointed.  If you don't understand the offerings , the kind ladies at the counter guide you.  I had the brisket sandwich and it was one of the best BBQ's I have had !!  We will make this  a stopping point on every trip.  A great experience overall !"}
{"text":"Found this little gem to stop at on the way to lake toxaway.  Friendly staff and cool ambience.  Ordered the pork sandwich, onion rings, brisket and corn dogs.  All solid.  Will be back next time we're driving through."}
{"text":"Ordered the Q Burger without lettuce tomato or mayo. Fried egg on the burger was cooked perfect but realized after it was almost 3/4 gone that it was suppose to come with bacon and griddled onions. By then I figured it out it was probably too late in the game to say anything Very disappointed, especially with the price of the burger, which the price of the bacon is already added in, which I paid for but didn't receive."}
{"text":"Found this place after landing in Charlotte, so glad we did! My sourhern husband said these were the best hushpuppies AND banana pudding he's ever had (THATS the highest compliment)! The lady who runs the front is awesome. She made us feel welcome and although the place is small, she took the time to come around the register and explain the menu wall thoroughly.   I gave 4 stars and not 5 because I think they offer too many items. For example, their fried items are stellar (corn dog, onion rings, hushpuppies) but the mac-n-cheese and grits I will not get again, and my pulled pork was kinda dry. That said, I stil cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly and helpful! We ordered the yard bird and wings. Food was good and worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I love peace n hominy.   The food is great and the owner is personable.  Plus I like supporting 'local business owners' rather than chains when I can."}
{"text":"Peace-N-Hominy is my absolute favorite place to visit when we come to town (my parents live here).  I'm gluten free and even pork free due to severe food sensitivities and they are incredibly accommodating!  The pulled chicken is amazing, the chips are out of this world, the slaw is yummy and they have Coke in a bottle.  Plus, my husband and kids (who are not gf) have so many delicious options!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch meals..... Bacon is an entree choice!  Does it get any better than that!  A little more expensive but certainly worth every penny!  Favorite lunch spot to date in the area!"}
{"text":"Normally I discount ad based placements on Yelp but that's good business and this is great bbq and more. Clean pleasant atmosphere but still feels like a Texas roundhouse. They have pork chicken ribs and BRISKET, but alas it was sold out!    The notion that good bbq is accidental is disproven here. I can tell the owners have developed their art/science over years and it is unique. I bet when I come next time the product will be consistent and equally great  Place is perfect for families on trip up or down 85. They have kids menu and the only thing smoking is the meat."}
{"text":"My all time favorite BBQ place I've ever been. All the meats are bursting with flavor. Recently got there food for my wedding. Inside can get cramped at times but you can expect that for how good it is.   If you wanting a good sit down place right here in belmont then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall barbeque place in Belmont! Love the name, logo and all the menu graphics! Someone put a lot of thought into this place.   The owner is very involved - she explained the menu, took our order (on an IPad) and even brought the food to our table. The service here is excellent. Look around the small dining room and you'll see lots of smiles from the staff and the customers.  Breakfast is served on weekends until 3PM for late risers.  My wingman had pancakes, eggs and sausage which he proclaimed \"Delicious\". I had a two meat combo plate with pulled pork and brisket. Both were fork tender, and the brisket rub was very good. The Bourbon baked beans were pretty dang amazing (with chucks of bacon). The jalapeno slaw was made with jarred/pickled jalapenos and didn't really stand out (maybe use fresh seeded ones for more kick?). Of their three homemade sauces the Hot was hands down my favorite.Well done! I love going to restaurants where they stand by their food and want to make sure you enjoy yourself. I also like that they carry craft beer from Railroad Brewery which is owned and operated by military veterans.  Parking available on the side and back lot. Two entrances - one in the back and one by the Belmont Drugs entrance.  A current Yelp offer took 10% off our bill, which isn't chump change!"}
{"text":"DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS GOOD FOOD TREAT!!! We met Christine, our owner and server and she was kind and gracious to help us as we had never been here before. Try it all. We went on Footlong Friday. Get that dog for a real treat! She gave us a sample of brisket, chicken, and pork. Every time we travel through Belmont, this will be our stop for treats. Not far off the I-85 and worth it!"}
{"text":"Great que! Try the pulled chicken. And their specialty breakfasts are just enormous. Try the Chicken poutine breakfast, be hungry though or just split it."}
{"text":"Big butt burger was fantastic, friendly service, family atmosphere,would stop in again for sure"}
{"text":"Love this quaint little shack! The food is delicious and the staff is always very friendly. The decor is so cute and makes you feel right at home. It's a hidden gem my husband and I recently discovered. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. It has great reviews on Yelp and Google. However went today with my lady and we were disappointed. The mac n cheese was just terrible. They were very slow getting the food out for a BBQ joint. I got a full rack a ribs thinking they had to be great cause of the reviews. They were average. Not falling off the none, almost tough. The jalapeño slaw was very good and the sauces were good. Hush puppies good. My ladies hamburger was average. I was just disappointed. I might would give them one more try."}
{"text":"I travel all over the US for work and it's always refreshing to find a place with great food, but that is charming and friendly! I had the 2 meat platter with brisket and pulled pork, side of slaw, and bean! The brisket was fall apart melt in your mouth good, as was the pork! Oh and the hush puppies were heavenly!! I travel to this area about once a year and I will definitely come back to Peace n Hominy Q!!!"}
{"text":"On vacation from CA and my husband and I were blown away by the food and service! Excellent prices too! Don't forget to have the banana pudding."}
{"text":"Met some friends for brunch today to introduce them to this awesome restaurant. Hubby and I decided to stray from our favorite (Southern Comfort) and try their Sunday Brunch special. Today's feature was The Barnyard. It was very good but I think I like the Southern Comfort a bit better. The chorizo gravy on the Southern Comfort is so yummy.  If you haven't found this gem in Belmont, you owe it to yourself to seek it out."}
{"text":"Wow, so happy to have good BBQ place in Belmont!  I've tried their brisket, pulled pork, and ribs and all of them were great! The ribs were some of the best ribs I've ever had. They only have them certain days of the week though, so be warned.   I'm also a big fan of the jalapeno slaw. They have a tasty variety of house made sauces as well.   Looking forward to trying out their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing brisket - the best I have had outside of Austin!  Super friendly staff did a great job of explaining the menu and making sure my meal was perfect.  Well worth checking it out!"}
{"text":"I'm suspicious of the extremely high ratings here!  My recent stop here had me excited to walk in, and even more excited to walk out!  It's a cute BBQ joint, small interior, order at a counter and sit in a hot dining room.  No AC apparently, just a few fans, and not a great product to take your mind off of the subpar attempt at BBQ! I tried a two meat combo of Pulled Pork and Smoked Turkey, with sides of Mac and Bourbon Beans.  The pork was decent even without a smoky flavor and too much fatty pieces mixed through!  The turkey was nothing more than a store bought breast, deli style sliced very thin and perfectly shaped, put through a oven to warm it up, and topped with a sauce possibly to flavor it?  BTW, the Brisket was oven roasted and fattier than the pork! The Mac n Cheese is kind of a weird dish as it's pasta with some Parmesan and shredded unmelted cheese on top.  A pretty tasteless and strange version!  The Bourbon Beans were sweet, and seemingly dumped out of a can and doctored up with brown sugar and possibly bourbon? Hence the name? On my way out, I noticed there isn't that familiar smoke in the air, nor that aroma of slow cooking meat.  Guess you don't need that for a oven I suppose?"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. We tried the ribs(only available on weekends), burgers,salad, and corn dogs. The sides were awesome and the price is right. This is ten minutes from the airport and a must stop for any foodies out there."}
{"text":"I go here several times when I'm in the area for work. It's great food, cheap and very friendly service.   I highly recommend coming here if you like good BBQ (they also make a MEAN brekky on the weekends).   A+"}
{"text":"Great food, very quick service.  Portions were plenty.  I would definitely go back.  Hush Puppies are the best I've ever had.   Update: Went back again last night; 3/21/2017. Awesome food, great service.   I had pulled pork plate, daughter had wings, wife had a Mexican themed pork dinner.  All were great.   We will definitely stop by on our next trip."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and looked up this place on Yelp for some BBQ. Tried the brisket, pulled pork and chorizo and all three were awesome. The food was delicious and definitely will come back again.    On top of that the staff was great.  Really nice people!!!  See ya again soon"}
{"text":"Such a huge fan of this place. Starting with service: the staff there is very friendly and helpful. As soon as we arrived, one of the owners came out and explained all of the specials as well as how the menu worked (it's unique!). The staff is just so kind and accommodating.   The restaurant is nestled in a little corner of Belmont--very quaint and peaceful! The restaurant itself is so family friendly. It holds artwork of members of the community, fun signs and sayings, etc.   The food is incredible. It bursts with flavor, and they have lots of really interesting combinations to get. I ordered a brisket taco special and every bite was delicious. We didn't need to add sauce to anything because it was already flavorful. I'm not a big fan of pork rinds, but it was such a fun \"side\" to add to the list.   We'll definitely be back...hopefully for brunch next!"}
{"text":"First time eating there, I have seen the post on yelp decided to take the drive from Ft. Mill.  The girl who took our order I think it was her first day, I knew the menu (from reading it online) better than she did.  She keep getting my order wrong, I ordered the WIT hot cakes and the Brisket Plate Breakfast.  She was overwhelmed with taking orders it was after 1 on a Saturday and there was a line, she was answering calls, taking orders (poorly) and running food.    I could barely read the menu, after she gave me the wrong one for brunch, she could have said there is a large one on the wall behind you...she did not, clearly stated we wanted the Brisket Plate Breakfast she punched in Brisket Sandwich (thankful she asked if we wanted coleslaw with that)    We got our food some was luke warm, some cold, some hot. I was really looking forward to the brisket (luke warm) over cooked (dark meat not red), no smoke on the outer part of the meat (no bark). So disappointed.  WIT hot cakes were okay, very sweet (get milk or drink water - not that great with a soft drink)  large cut potatoes (not home fries) eggs were pretty good over easy, the puppies w/honey were bigger than a golf ball and as hard as one too, not cooked all the way in the middle (not good) - terrible sweet tea - changed to fountain cheerwine  I really wanted to like this place, i have been asking to go there for 3 months, glad I paid, I apologized all the way home for the experience"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now and each time it gets better! So far I have only had their BBQ which is great! Their sides are unique from other BBQ restaurants, you don't get your typical slaw or Mac here. I also have to say that they make the best hush puppies I have ever had!! Don't be afraid to try something different here!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I was born and raised in the area, but haven't been home in a while.  What a surprise to see how Belmont has grown since I've been gone.  I came to this joint at a friends recommendation and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'd love to come back to get to know the menu better and taste all of their offerings, but I settled for a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and a side of fries.  Killer fries.  I love when a restaurant doesn't treat the sides as afterthoughts.  This is a divey, funky little joint in the best possible way.  Any time I'm back in town, I'll be sure to stop by.   I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Recently listed as one of Yelp's 2017 Top 100 Places to Eat in Charlotte, I can see why. My brunch today was fantastic. Marvelous. Awesome. Delicious! More superlatives!  The menu is posted on the wall and you order/pay at the register then take a seat. It took a bit to decide because it all sounded tasty but I ended up on the \"Porkapalooza hash, \" a mix of pulled pork, bacon and sausage with homefries and onions and then topped with chorizo gravy and then two eggs (I chose mine poached). A mess of food but holy cow (pig?), tasty as all get out. The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Yep, this barbecue joint does a weekend brunch menu. Woot!  It seriously does not get better than this. a huge, delicious breakfast. A great price and terrific service. Well done, Peace -N- Hominy. Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoked brisket, cole slaw, & potato salad. Original sauces, custom rub on baby back ribs is perfect. This is not a \"fine dining\" place; just the best examples of southern cooking you will find in NC.  The locals have discovered Peace & Hominy it's busy and noisy during peak hours. Try the crispy puppies too.  Chistine, the friendly owner, helps clear tables and chats with customers too."}
{"text":"We are from Texas and this BBQ could match our Killeans or Salt lick.  The owner was extremely nice to us.  I had the two meat special turkey and brisket.  I wanted lean brisket.  I got a great cut with tons of flavor.  They offer four different bbq sauces.  I liked the three amigos.  It has a little spice but not too much.  The kids got 6 cheese mac and cheese.  My daughter didn't like it so the owner gave her a burger.  Everyone else loved it.   Son got chorizo and it tastes just like home."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Starting with the look and feel. Professional clean BUT extremely casual and friendly.  The service is great. People are just honestly nice! And to finish it all the food is great.  Bbq is just amazing.  Don't miss it"}
{"text":"This gem is worth the drive. A little hard to find but worth the effort. BBQ is spot on. I love the brunch menu and their corn bread is killer!"}
{"text":"Went once before on a Saturday and it was so crowded we couldn't get in so we figured it was good. Today we weren't disappointed. I had a traditional breakfast and it was delicious but the real treat to me were the biscuits with a side of honey butter. They reminded me of my grandma's. My husband had the baby back ribs. He was pleased. The ambiance was nostalgic of my teens in the 70's and the staff were helpful and very pleasant. We will definitely be back (especially since my kitchen is out of commission for a few days)."}
{"text":"Went this past weekend with wife and daughter.  We all had the pork sandwiches and slaw and fries. Everything was very good including the service. Really enjoyed the sauces too. Definitely worth the short drive from Charlotte. Nice people run the place plus it was very clean.  Looking forward to next trip there."}
{"text":"What an awesome place!  If you get to Belmont, this is a must-go place to eat. They primarily have bbq, smoked meats, burgers, but many more awesome items. I had their corn dogs. This isn't your run of the mill type of corn dog. It is a foot long with homemade honey batter. The honey bourbon beans are the best bbq type of beans I've ever had. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast...amazing!!  I had the chorizo sausage gravy covering hash with pulled pork, bacon, sausage, and fried eggs!!!"}
{"text":"The truth about barbecue these days is that the secret is out -- lots of folks know how to smoke a brisket. A barbecue joint's test, then, comes with the Everything Else. And this place does the Everything Else - service, sides, price, and ambiance - really well."}
{"text":"We grabbed lunch at Peace-N-Hominy Q early on a Sunday afternoon.  I ordered a brisket plate with chili mac as my side, jalapeno slaw, and a link of chorizo.  The brisket was tender but dry.  This has been a recurring theme with their smoked meats every time I've eaten here.  It tastes good but is screaming for some salt, and their \"hot\" barbecue sauce isn't hot at all and has a more assertive sweet quality to it.  The jalapeno slaw was good, but it's literally their regular slaw with a single pickled jalapeno slice placed on top.  If there is diced jalapeno in the slaw itself, it's completely invisible.  The chili mac is tasty, but extremely rich and needs a little salt.  I usually finish everything on my plate but I couldn't get through all of it.  It was the second time I ordered their chorizo and it's absolutely delicious.  They season and spice it perfectly.  Unfortunately on this occasion, it was griddled a bit too long which desiccated the exterior and made the texture somewhat crunchy and unappealing.  It was also less juicy than on my previous visit.  Overall it was a tasty meal, but I feel like there are just a few details keeping this place from being the best it can be."}
{"text":"Lunch Mar 12   Local place and I love those type joints.  Great down home, small town, feel.   Staff was very very friendly and helpful, you can tell they really care about the business, the food and the customers their satisfaction! What I really loved...   The sauces, which actually added flavor to the meats and enhanced the taste   The Cole Slaws, both regular and jalapeno were very good   Onion Rings were hand breaded and light and flaky, loved them! What was just okay...   Got the 3 meat combo (pork, chicken and brisket) all 3 were dryer than they were juicy and not as flavorful as I would have expected.  But, the sauces really combined well and made the meat \"pop\", so it wasn't at all bad.    The chicken wings were big, juicy and cooked perfectly, but again, the taste of the special rub was a bit elusive, but 3 Amigo Sauce helped add great flavor.    If I was in Belmont again, I would eat here, as everyone raved about the ribs, which we didn't get because they were 30 minutes away from getting done.      Would like to have given 3.5 stars, but rounded up to 4 due to the staff!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come up from mountain island lake and we are glad that we did! Very friendly staff and amazing BBQ.  This was not your typical soggy NC BBQ! You could tell it was all freshly made! I had the special chorizo tacos and my hubby had the brisket- both were awesome!  We will definitely be going out of our way to come back!"}
{"text":"They have amazing food me and my family eat there very regular the staff are all friendly and very on top of there jobs nice clean place to grab some BBQ or anything"}
{"text":"Yelp this is a winner! Small local and delicious!   Great pork Great chicken Great ribs Great ham  Staff is super friendly. Tables have everything you need including a roll of paper towels! You get your own drinks which is one thing I dig actually. Only thing I didn't like was my 5yr old eating all the ribs before I got any. But the waitress made sure I got some to try to go, for free! Dude who does that?! Yes we will be back."}
{"text":"First visit about three weeks ago.  I enjoyed my visit!  Food was very good.  I had the BBQ turkey.  The pork n beans w/ ground beef were delicious!  Very friendly and helpful staff.  I will be back!  Give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Classic small-town delicious BBQ! Super tender meat, zingy flavorful sauces, crispy hush puppies, homemade pickles, and classic sides. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food served with friendly southern hospitality!  Loved every my meal. Pulled pork was so tender and perfect with the original BBQ sauce. They have 3 different types of slaw - mayo-based, vinegar based and jalapeño. I had the mayo slaw which was a wonderful compliment with the pork. Mac and cheese was yummy too."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing!!!! It's hard to find but well worth it!!! At first we were not sure why no one was coming to the table, then we discover you go upto the register and order and pay."}
{"text":"Very friendly and prompt service even during busy time. The turkey and the pulled pork is very tender and flavorful. I would defiantly return. Very good local bbq."}
{"text":"I stopped in today to grab a quick lunch and decided to try a burger for a change.  Every new thing I've tried here in the last year has been awesome.  There is literally nothing on their menu that I haven't enjoyed.  The burger was awesome too, and those onion rings are fabulous.    They've also got great Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs (totally awesome, but you'll need to go on a Friday or Saturday), Turkey, and yes, even a Bacon item on the menu.  I also really enjoy their salad, mac-n-cheese, slaw, and Brunswick stew.   Also, they offer an awesome breakfast menu.   We're really glad to have this restaurant and family business in Belmont!"}
{"text":"OMG amazing food. Best BBQ I've probably ever had and I've had a lot of BBQ. It was so good that it was hard to stop eating it. We are way beyond what our stomachs could handle but totally worth it. Definitely work a stop. Plus everyone was so nice and helpful! A+++"}
{"text":"My family has been 3 times now and every meal is wonderful! Between us we've had the pork plate, pork sandwich, hamburger, hot dog, hush puppies, fries, cheesy grits and creamed corn. Every meal is fresh, tasty and not something I could make at home. The staff is very friendly without hovering over the tables and the atmosphere is homey yet fresh and new feeling. They also have a cooler filled with bottled beverages including craft beers and Cheerwine. We haven't been back for brunch yet but plan on trying it soon!"}
{"text":"New favorite BBQ place! Went searching for a new restaurant to try over the weekend and my fiancé had heard of this place from her coworkers. Went down to try it and was not disappointed! I had the ribs with the mixture sauce (mix of normal sauce, vinegar sauce, and hot sauce) and it was so good. Also had hush puppies and pimento cheese dip which were delightful. They also had Cheerwine and Sun Drop at the soda fountain. Only downside is it a little small but the waitress said that when it's warmer they have more seating outside. Can't wait to try their brunch as well!"}
{"text":"If it's packed and you're planning to dine in, no worries, they have more seating in the kitchen. Which is where the cool koalas sit.  The service is wonderful, super knowledgeable, capable of great recommendations. The menu is huge, and dynamic. Which can be a bit overwhelming for newbies, ask questions.  Jalapeños slaw is Grateful Dead coveting Buddy Holly good.   I had the wings, brisket and pork. Wood smoked wings was a new incarnation of the wing family for me, and they were the star of the meal. Meaty, juicy, tender. Hit them w/ the sriracha BBQ sauce and let the tongue Moon walk. The brisket & pork aren't the greatest in the world, but they're in the top 10%.   For desert I koala'd down the hush puppies. I'm pretty sure that's a traditional southern desert.  They have beer too."}
{"text":"Southern comfort BBQ resturant with causal atmospheres.  Vegan Friendly - No Food (3.5 Stars) - Fresh but portions are small and pricy. Spent $70+ including tip for three entrees, corn dog, two additional sides, and two desserts Ambiance (4 Stars) - Local casual place with a TV back corner if you want to watch the game Service (4 Stars) - Counter service then food is brought to you. Friendly Jimmy's Hacks - Only 10 tables. If it's busy have someone grab a table while another orders. On Sunday the Pharmacy is closed, so parking out front is open.   Note... reviews maybe updated after future visits. If you find any of my hacks or reviews helpful pls follow & like my review for more. Thx"}
{"text":"Food takes awhile when busy, which I imagine is whenever they open the doors. Come in, order then seat yourself. That's only if you can find a spot to sit down. 4 stars because a few items were missed on out to-go order."}
{"text":"Quick service, tasty food, and friendly staff! Perfect spot for lunch for a group of 8 after touring the Daniel Stowe Botanical Gardens. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this cute little hole in the wall bbq joint. Im a bbq snob an I loved it not to mention the staff is so nice. I ordered the pull pork with mac n cheese of course Im a southern girl lol It came with slaw an baked beans an I added an order of onion rings. I got my order to go I was so hungry an it smelled so good I started eating the onion rings driving home lol If you are in Gastonia looking for a quick bite with great food n service you have to stop in. Bbq is cooked to perfection so good Ill b back :)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I love pulled pork; my coworker and I joke that I will find pulled pork anywhere I go. I was across the street at the antique store browsing around when I got the feeling I'd had enough antiques and needed something to eat. Popped on yelp, found this place and thought to myself I might have seen it on my feed before. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. I was going to order coleslaw too but the girl ringing me up let me know it comes with just enough to put on your sandwich already. My kind of place! Everything was fresh, hot and flavorful. The sauces are on the table and they've got 3 or 4 to choose from. No mustard based Carolina sauce here, though. They've got lots of bottled beer and soda options. My meal plus a hard cider came in around $10. Is this real life? What a deal! The menu was a little hard to navigate the first time around; lots to read but who am I kidding I was going to get pulled pork anyways. The restaurant is small and clean with pleasant people working there serving good food. What more could I want?"}
{"text":"Whoa!! What can I really say... this is a rare find. Usually I'm a little skeptical about great reviews on here but this place surpassed the reviews. It's a little hidden but once you find your way in, you're greeted with a warm welcome and if its your first time, they actually take the time to go over the menu with you.   I had the Pick 3 (chorizo, brisket, pulled pork) w/ the chili mac and jalapeño slaw.  The chorizo comes a little dark and looks a little dry but once you bite into it, you get a crunch with juicy spicy pork it was cooked to perfection. I'd prefer chorizo w/ a kick but this had just a bite not too spicy but overall good flavor.  The brisket was juicy and tender, moist with a crispy outer layer. Also it carried just enough fat to give it a natural smoky flavor, not overly fatty like some other places. I Love BBQ but I'm more of a brisket person than a pulled pork person but the pulled pork I was very impressed with, crispy outside not overly dry, or wet. Perfect amount of juices to were you get a crunch from the outer layer and the inside is flaky and still moist enough to not be too chewy.  The chili Mac was Wow for me! The Mac was cheesy, they chili had a kick with just a hint of sweet. Perfect balance of texture with the soft macaroni elbow, salt/sweet of the chili, and topped off with gooey cheese. Great Side if you're really in the mood for comfort. The slaw, I'm always a sucker for great slaw to balance out a hardy mean. The slaw did just that. Best slaw I've had in a while. Not too runny, nice crunch with the fresh cabbage and carrots, a little kick with pepperoni and pickled jalapeños, served cold. Again just great balance with the meats. Only regret is not ordering an extra order of the slaw.  Last but not least, the service. Extremely friendly service. Very informative and helpful when it comes to the food. Feels like you're at grandmas house. They really go out of there way to make sure you're satisfied with everything. Awesome Place!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent pork plate. Tender and juicy. Slaw was excellent. Finely chopped and perfectly seasoned. We couldn't eat it fast enough it was so delicious!   FYI - The cute graphic design logo on the side of the building pulled us in b/c we had NO clue there was even a restaurant hidden on the side street. We were shopping at the antique mall & we were looking for a place to eat. The entrance we went in was not marked so we ended up going through a side door that took us through to the restaurant. I'm glad we found it and we will go back. Your food is really good!"}
{"text":"The 3 Amigos sauce is excellent!! I got the pulled chicken, creamed corn, and onion rings. All were very good, just wish they were  a little warmer. My husband got the pulled pork, mac-n-cheese and cheesy grits. May be personalpreference, but we felt the noodles were too \"mushy\"and the grits were to \"wet\"... would have preferred them thicker. Overall it was very good and we will be back."}
{"text":"What a cute spot! The staff is friendly and the food is great. I've ordered take-out twice. The dining room is small, but there is a patio. I'm sure they get crowded, but I think they do a lot of take-out business."}
{"text":"Well, if you want down home southern pulled pork this is a good place. Very casual in a storefront. Clean and family owned. Everything is proudly home made All the usual southern comport food. Onion rings, fries, bbq beans,slaw, Mac and cheese and burgers, chicken, brisket and pulled pork.  The place has wonderful small town charm. The service is friendly and fast.  It has a feel of olden times with some modern values.  Quick take out too"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on the reviews but was left disappointed. While the staff is friendly and welcoming the BBQ was just mediocre. Brisket lacked a smoke ring and was reheated. Pulled pork was tender but lacked the depth of flavor that you would expect from real North Carolina BBQ. Hush puppies were dense and doughy and for some reason we're rolled in sugar. The search continues for good BBQ in the area.  In reply to Peach & Hominy's response: I ordered the brisket and pork plate. So by \"plenty of smoke and time\" are you talking 15 hours on a wood-fired smoker or is the brisket cooked in an oven and finished off (or started) on a commercial gas smoker? It tasted like the latter. I guess I was just expecting a deep smoke ring and depth of flavor that you can only get from going low and slow on a wood smoker. This is one of the BBQ capitals of the world after all.  It wasn't bad and if I was looking for a quick lunch it could be an option but I was seeking out real North Carolina BBQ.  P.s. Where was the hominy on the menu? :)"}
{"text":"I recently used Peace N Hominy for a catering event. Amazing! All of our guests were elated. They setup quick, served with pride and cleaned up perfectly. The food was fresh and flavorful. Every menu item is special, even the cream corn. Can't wait for our next event. Thank you William and Christine."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town looking for some good Carolina BBQ, and had some great BBQ! The chicken and turkey were great, with great sauces. The Mac and Cheese came out cold and wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy EVER!!!! Can't wait to come back! We also recently ordered some food to pick up and cater a small event. We got the Mac and cheese and pulled chicken sandwiches. Everyone raved about the food! If you're looking for an authentic local meal, look no further!"}
{"text":"We love the pig critter here at Peace - N - Hominy!  Living in Belmont it's probably one of the best spots to eat.  A little off the beaten path, but well worth the extra 2 mins from downtown Belmont."}
{"text":"Great location for a meal if you are in the area antique shopping.  Very cute inside, the BBQ is a little bland for me, but I would give it another try for sure.  It's a cozy place, relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Oh my, don't tell my fitness trainer what I ate here. Pork sandwich fries and key lime pie with ice tea for under $13.00 Fantastic service, food and value.    They even gave me the wifi code so I could do some work while enjoying this meal. Terrific people working at a terrific restaurant !!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Christina the Owner greeted us and explained the menu.   Clearly love abounds in the restaurant especially in the prep of the food. I wish I lived in the area it would be my to go place for BBQ"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Everyone in here was super friendly, the food was awesome and the place is adorable.  We had the pulled pork and coop poutine (decadent, but worth it). Both were delicious, but the beans were the standout- sweet, thick and bacony. Great little lunch spot."}
{"text":"A cute little quaint bbq shack in Belmont. They have a nice variety of bbq sauces.  Give it a try and always eat local when you can!"}
{"text":"WOW, this is some amazing BBQ.  I went in with the intention of getting brisket, and was lured away by their special of the day.  I don't think you will go wrong ordering anything they have."}
{"text":"this restaurant was so yummy. The lady that helped that I was really kind and explain the menu to us. And was really helpful while we were eating. We got the pork bacon and the brisket and everything was fantastic. We also really like the chili mac and the grits with cheese. Everything was good and we had to roll ourselves out of the restaurant LOL no but for real this place was fantastic."}
{"text":"A wonderful Carolina style BBQ joint! Located 10 minutes from the airport, this place is a delicious family-run, top notch barbecue! They offer daily specials, as well as the regular Carolina style of grub- pulled pork.  They have a variety of meats- including beef cuts and meatloaf. Their sides are where it's at. I had bourbon baked beans, which had a delicious sweet taste to them. Their hushpuppies also had a sweetness to them.  They have 4 different BBQ sauces- Hot, Original, Vinegar, and the 3 Amigos- which is a blend of the other three. My favorite was the hot version, as I am accustomed to Texas BBQ, but the three amigos had the perfect ratio of vinegar to the tomato sauces, if you ask me!  They even offer Southern sodas and sweet tea, of course. Cheerwine Cola and Sun Drop Soda are available on tap.  The whole restaurant is doing their best to be eco-friendly, recycling their waste, and issuing wooden forks & knives, and paper straws to go with your eco-friendly cup.  The decor includes kids' drawings of animals that get BBQ'd, and are especially well done.  Overall, this is a great dining experience, and I'd recommend it highly to get some local cuisine."}
{"text":"Went to this unassuming place by the antique mall this afternoon and highly recommend it. Yes, barbecue is a somewhat personal and controversial subject in the south. Depending on your geography and upbringing, you may bring preconceived ideas about what good 'Q ought to be. In Charlotte alone there are probably a hundred styles. This accounts for the roller coaster reviews for any barbecue joint. There's a lot of emotion in that thar smoke. Peace n hominy, though, has got a good thing going. We had the smoked wings and the ribs which are only available on Friday and Saturday. The meat was really good. Well seasoned with a good pink smoke ring. The ribs were soft enough to just about fall off the bone but not soft enough to totally come apart. They have several sauces. Original, three amigos, vinegar based and a sriracha based. Tried em all. No losers in the crowd. The slaw comes in regular, barbecue and jalapeño. No losers here either. Smoked six cheese mac'n'cheese?  You just may get tired of winning...  Finished up. Toweled off with the wet naps. Grabbed a tea refill to go. Will be back to try the hush puppies.   Staff, by the way, is warm and welcoming like a small family place should be. Prices were great. They also did a nice job decorating the place. Thanks for lunch!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in NC! All their specials are to die for, very affordable and such a friendly staff. VERY clean too! High recommended1  What more does a girl need than a BBQ sandwich with pepperjack cheese, original sauce & vinegar base, fries, and a classic bottle Cheerwine. Only meal I ate yesterday because I knew nothing else would taste that good."}
{"text":"BRING YOUR APPETITE!  Brunch and Lunch menus looked amazing!  Stopped by this past Sunday for lunch. The After Church crowd was in full effect. Plenty of parking. Place is really cool. It's small inside but they have a few tables out back. I had the brisket plate that came with 2 hush puppies (which are a super sweet batter) and a couple carrots and a couple pickle slices.   The brisket was $11 which I was expecting about that price but the portion was lacking. It was sliced thin  (3mm thick I'd say) but it was only about a fist full of meat. Luckily the Mac and cheese was filling. The banana pudding was pretty good as well. Bananas were fresh and the bills wafer crumbles on top were awesome.  I kept 1 star for price and 1 for portion. I'll come back and see if either measure changes.  Cheers!  As far as staff, the 3 teenage girls that were speed walking orders out and wiping tables down. TOP NOTCH. They were super friendly and one girl even kept me from busting my ass on a slippery floor haha. Service was fast too considering the huge crowd. Will be back next time I'm in Belmont visiting family."}
{"text":"Ugh. The bbq might be good, I don't know--haven't had it--but the \"brunch\" or breakfast food was...well, I didn't eat it. The ordering procedure was very inefficient, time consuming, confusing, you name it. There was only one person in front of us in line (and it was not clear at all when you walk in what the ordering procedures even were) and we waited for a long time to even be able to place our order. After ordering, they brought to us incorrect orders twice before finally getting it right. The food is served on weird paper plates with plastic forks.  Won't be back unless it's to try the bbq, which must be better or all the good reviews don't make sense."}
{"text":"My husband and I were just there on Saturday.  It was a little crowded so we sat at the counter in the back.  The food was fabulous as always and the staff always shows genuine care for their customers.  We don't go there just for the great food but to unwind and relax."}
{"text":"We love it!  Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, it doesn't matter.  Always great food.  The owner is so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot dog to go and was told the price would be 7.00 because it was a special with a drink and potato salad. I told the cashier that I only wanted a single hot dog. She was very rude and had a nasty attitude and told me that ordering that way would only reduce my bill by 50 cents. I do not care to pay for items that I will not be eating and I do not care for the rudeness. I did not place an order and immediately left."}
{"text":"Went to Belmont Botanical Gardens and took a chance on this restaurant of the numerous offered in Belmont. Wow! Best. Burger. Ever. The Big Butt Burger was seasoned so well and loaded with pulled pork, bacon and cheese. It was amazing. Staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly. Owner came to the table. Choose this place."}
{"text":"Gotta gotta gotta try this place! The food was amazing. The Chili Mac was outta this world! I also had the brisket and pork, wow! Jalapeño Slaw....uh yes!!! Me and the family will be making this place our go-to place for BBQ and smoked meats. Job well done Peace N Hominy. Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Got off a plane and was headed to Asheville.   Found this place on Yelp and boy was it fire.   The meats (turkey, brisket, pulled pork) were on point as were the sides.    The BBQ cole slaw was on point as were all there sauces.  The help really cared for us."}
{"text":"First time going this morning for breakfast and the pancakes were really good. My boyfriend got a meal (I forget the name), but it had eggs, pork, home fries, & chorizo gravy & he LOVED it! We will definitely come back. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Perfect BBQ and the friendliest service! Had the pulled pork, pulled chicken, and some very tender brisket. Paired it with some jalapeño cole slaw, bourbon baked beans, and cheesy grits. Will definitely come back if we are ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Good local folks. Can't go wrong with it. Ask what they recommend and if there are any specials. Great beer selection too"}
{"text":"Decent pork , brisket was overdone , Mac n cheese look / tasted and felt like it had sat in the pot all day. Clumped together like mush. The only enjoyable parts were beans and ~$3.25 craft bottles of beer. Otherwise it didn't live up to the hype of other reviewers experiences."}
{"text":"I went only one time some months back. The place was recommended by a co-worker.  It was not very busy...it is a small crowded place.  The food was OK, but nothing fantastic. I prefer Hillbilly's (McAdenville)"}
{"text":"I've been twice, lunch and brunch. I didn't like the mac and cheese side or the breakfast potatoes. So far the rest has been ok. I'll eat here again but only if it's convenient."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about. It was decent, but far from great and not a good value for the money.   I got the brisket melt special. The baked beans were slightly better than straight from a can. The brisket was very bland and pretty greasy. The portion was small (but that's ok because so was the flavor).   I will probably go back eventually. But it's not going to be soon."}
{"text":"If you think you've had bbq and haven't come to Peace-n-Hominy, you're wrong! All you've really had was BB. To all you BBQ fans AND non fans, do yourselves a favor and give Peace-n-Hominy a chance. Ya got nothin to lose! This is one of the few southern restaurants I know where you truly feel at peace with other guests and restaurant staff. Hence the name, at Peace-n-Hominy a soothing and positive atmosphere meets an array of southern flavors that  harmoniously quench every calm-seeking nerve in your body (and digestive tract). In other words, come MEAT Peace and Hominy! Ya won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went to grab an early dinner with the Hubs and decided to give this place a try. Beyond ecstatic and satisfied that we did! Who knew this little hidden Gem was right here in my hometown!  By far the BEST BBQ in Belmont and surrounding areas!  Fast, friendly and the Food is AMAZING!  This is our new place to eat out at once a week and we will definitely be trying Breakfast this weekend! !"}
{"text":"I usually judge my bbq places on their brisket and this place was amazing. The brisket and turkey were incredible and some of the best bbq I've had. Sauces were good but nothing special, but for me it's all about the meat, not the sauce. Most of the sides were good but forgettable and typical bbq restaurant style but the hush puppies were awesome, always appreciate a good sweet hush puppy."}
{"text":"Pulled pork - outstanding, brisket - smoky and slightly dry.  Q -sauce - go for the hottest (it is not TMI hot, just right). Great Staff.  Recommended."}
{"text":"This was my first authentic North Carolina BBQ experience, and it was awesome! I was in NC for a work trip, and was dying to try \"REAL\" NC BBQ. I am so happy I checked out Yelp and decided on this lovely little restaurant.  I stopped in for a late lunch, and the server that was there was one of the most pleasant staff I've ever encountered. I explained that it was my first time visiting, and she explained the menu to me in detail. She made some recommendations, and I ended up going for the 2-meat combo plate of brisket and pulled pork. My sides were the mac n' cheese, slaw, and hush puppies.  I've had hush puppies before and wasn't impressed, but these were REALLY good! I loved the sweet flavor they had, and they were perfectly soft and moist on the inside, and exquisitely crispy on the outside. Mmmmmmmm. The hush puppies were actually my favorite of the three sides.  The pulled pork was excellent, and I love that there are various different sauces available to try. I sampled all, but the original house sauce (I think that's what it's referred to) was my favorite. It had the perfect combo of tangy and sweet.  I'm not in NC often, but when I go visit my client in the area next time, I'll make sure I make time to stop by for some more BBQ!"}
{"text":"Peace and Hominy put Belmont on the map. They've been around for a long time and are constantly serving up smiles and good southern cooking. Their restaurant isn't big and fancy. It's go up to the counter style ordering and then they bring your food out to you wherever your sitting. Nothing beats sitting out on the porch!!   Breakfast, lunch or dinner there is nothing you can order that can go wrong. I've been a few times now and always grab something different. Mostly because I'll sit down with my food (that looks delicious) and then see someone else's food that looks amazing too.   Their breakfast specials are so good. The chorizo gravy is amazing just over rice but they make some concoctions on a plate that you wouldn't expect. And they are all great!   Still don't miss out on their bbq and other southern staples they have. They will keep you coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time in tonight and we loved it. All of the food was delicious and the staff was super friendly. Love the paper straws!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town for a couple days and checked out the Yelp reviews for the best place to get some barbecue. We were led here and are very appreciative of the folks who have left reviews because we are very impressed with this small place.   They are very friendly. The first thing they did was ask if we have been there before and made sure to explain the menu. We ordered our food and they brought it to us and made sure we were explained the sauces. We love Cheerwine but don't get a lot of it from where we are from so we got the bottles. We didn't notice they had the fountain Cheerwine which we believe tastes better until later.   After we enjoyed our meal and our bottled sodas, we decided we were going to grab a couple fountain Cheerwines. When I went to pay for a couple cups, the lady just handed us two cups and told us not to worry about it and thanked us for stopping in.   The review was already a 5 before that but they made sure we would come back here next time we are in town. Thank you so much for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with the friendliest staff around. Had never been here before and two women who worked here dropped by to break down the menu and make sure we understood everything. Try the chili mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"suuuuuwwweeeeee, now thats what I call good customer service. Great when we arrived. Took the time to go over the entire menu when she asked if it was our first time. Served fast and then came to every table to ensure we are all good with our choices. Not just good CS but the food was great as well. We enjoyed the whole experience and can't wait to stop back in. We had the Baby Back ribs on special which they should have every day and the brisket and shared. Very very good"}
{"text":"This is likely one of my top 5 restaurants that I have reviewed on Yelp. It's a simple and quaint little place in \"downtown Belmont\". I can't wait to see the area during the day. It looked like a scene out of a movie at night.   We walk in and are greeted by me of the owners. She tells us how it works (probably her 10,000th time) but she tells us as if it is the first. Patient and helpful. What a menu. BBQ of course and other simple fare like chili dogs and burgers. Fries and onion rings.   I ordered the 3 meat and got pulled pork, bacon slices and beef brisket.  The brisket is smoked for 15 hours.  Now that is dedication!  The bacon is the kind of bacon you might kill another man for!    My son had a chili dog.  When it came out - he about fell out of his chair.  He was not ready for it to be. Foot long!  He really liked it. We shared fries and onion rings.  The rings were terrific.  The fries are a weak spot for them.  If the owners are reading this, do away with these fries and go fresh cut.  It would perfectly complement your other items.   I also had the jalapeño slaw.  An interesting take.  I would have preferred shredded slaw to the finely chopped but it was still very good.    The owner checked on us 3-4 times during the meal and also sent us on our way.  What attentiveness!  I highly recommend this place can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am picky as hell about my breakfast places.  It usually doesn't take long for me to find a reason to go back to cooking at home and saving my money.  Unless Peace-n-Hominy starts screwing up soon, I'm going to go broke. I've been there solo, taken friends, fed my kids and found any number of excuses to go by there.  Favorites?  Porkapalooza hash, chorizo and egg breakfast tacos with onions (don't kiss me after I eat that), cornbread with the peach sauce ... you get the idea. It's all good, and the staff is unfailingly friendly.  Don't take a book, because you'll find plenty to read on the walls.  I've been there for dinner a couple of times, and also been quite pleased, especially with the brisket.  And the banana pudding for dessert is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Ok so let's talk BBQ! Peace N Hominy is a great little nook in what is sort of a passer by suburb of Charlotte. When you come here, it'll be for the meat, but you'll remember it for the sauces and boy are they good. I've lived across the South and their wing sauce is by far the hottest I've seen readily served to consumers. The pork holds its own, while the brisket is of great texture- even if a bit dry to the taste.   I reaaaaaally wanted to give this place 4 stars, but the environment keeps it as a solid 3. The blaring Christian worship music and overtly preachy decorations, conjured some very uncomfortable social issues in North Carolina. LGBT people shouldn't avoid this restaurant, however keep in mind where your money could be going. And while very, very nice, the clientele and staff present southern charm with good food, even if it can be a bit zealous.     Update: Ownership was very kind in reaching out with assurance that all are welcome at their establishment. Again, while the decor is prototypical BBQ joint, it shouldn't keep an urbanite from experiencing what is an outright down-home meal. Due to their commitment to equality and customer service, I have decided an extra star is warranted. *4"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night.  We walked in and were a little confused as to how it worked. So we asked the lady who was directing the staff activities.  She was the warmest person and took us through the entire menu. We ordered at the counter and took our number. We sat in the back at another counter. There are cute tin signs lining the wall with 'southernisms' like 'kiss my grits', etc.  The food came out and it was spectacular!  We had our choice of 4 bbq sauces to slather our meals with.  If you want a no nonsense, delicious meal with a very warm welcome: this is the place for you! They have brunch on the weekends.... we will be going back soon to have this! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant about 2 months ago. This is by far the best breakfast in Gaston county. Atmosphere is homey and comfortable and the staff are all friendly and personable. We have ate here about every Saturday morning ever since!"}
{"text":"Wow what a treat for the mouth. Beefeater was moist and tasty, Potato salad was fresh and creamy, mayo base not mustard, and tea was just sweet enough. Definitely worth a trip over to for satisfying that hunger bug. Yes I found this great place thru Yelp."}
{"text":"We turned to Yelp to find somewhere new to eat lunch on a sunday afternoon and Peace N Hominy popped up. Based on the good reviews we decided to give it a shot. Staring at the menu was a little overwhrlming and i ultimately ordered the pulled  chicken sandwich and chips and my husband got the pulled pork plate with mac and cheese and hushpuppies. I have to say were both impressed with the freshness and quality of the meat. Everything was delicious and we left with happy, full bellies. This is definitely  a place we look forward to returning  too and trying out more of the menu. Thanks for not disappointing!!"}
{"text":"This is one great, nicely located barbecue spot just outside of Charlotte. If you're coming from the airport, it's an easy five minute drive down the 85 freeway to Belmont. Extremely nice crew running it, and it always has excellent 'cue, too. Near perfect lunch spot for trips out to the Blue Ridge."}
{"text":"Great place-stopped in after landing in Charlotte. Friendly staff. We tried a little of everything and very sauce. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp!  Located this place right near downtown Belmont and have visited a few times.   I find this place to be well priced and the quality of the food is great as well.  The staff is friendly and helpful if you look to be a \"newby.\"  Takeout: Parking is so close to the door.  And all the packaging is biodegradable containers and silverware.  #enviornment!  I placed a phone order for 1 person, and they said it would be ready in 5 minutes.  Can't beat that timing, couldn't drive there quick enough!  Brunch/Breakfast: Great selection, and the portions are very generous to fill you up for breakfast and lunch combined!  It gets pretty busy in there, but there still seemed to be enough tables for the line even at the longest point.  Dinner: I found it is usually a bit slower in the evenings from a few trips, which makes it very quick to order and get your food.  I had the special item, which should be added to the regular menu!  It was a Havana type cuban sandwich... I can still remember the taste of it.  If you haven't tried this yet, definitely make a quick trip there.  Likely won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Meals were creative and value-priced.  This place is excellent.  Lots of beer choices in the bottle - $2.50 each.  Lots of side choices.  Couldn't have found a better hole in the wall.  Good luck and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Ordered   by phone and paid 4 ! Twenny minutes later i pulls up to grab my friggin order they says order not pulled! GD lady  gives me a coupon says come in next time  we got you! I don't wanna come here  next  time !"}
{"text":"I don't know where these other people ate but this is one of the worst places in Belmont to eat. The food is subpar at best. Maybe this sounds petty, but the menu makes my head hurt just looking at it. Seriously it's a train wreck. We ordered cheese grits and got what looked like a small bowl of instant grits with a pinch of cheese on top. I've been there twice and that was once to many. Both times the food was bland and mushy."}
{"text":"Food was average. Elderly blonde lady behind counter was rude.  A pricey $12 plate came with 8 ounces of fries and 4 ounces of meat 2 cake sweet hush puppies and a sample of slaw.  Bible quotes of the day on menu and all around the place on the walls along with this quote  \"\"When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music, and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in\" I'm guessing that's not church approved...."}
{"text":"Got the brisket sandwich and was thoroughly impressed. Service was wonderful, staff was welcoming, and I would highly recommend both the Mac & cheese and the 3 amigos BBQ sauce. Would definitely come back to this spot in the future!"}
{"text":"Really good place. Defiantly worth at least one visit. Food is usually really good. Good selection of beer too."}
{"text":"In town for the day on business and stopped in for lunch.  The food here was just divine!  I got the pork platter with jalapeño cole slaw and cheese grits.  Excellent flavor variety and quality.  I totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is good! The bbq not on par with what I'm used to. Everything I tasted had sugar in it! The bbq, the hushpuppies, which is really weird...but their breakfast on the weekends is great! They have livermush! Yum! And their apple butter pancakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"My company ordered pork and chicken for 350+ people. I've heard nothing but great things from my employees about how moist and flavorful the meat was. They also brought a bunch of sauce and delivered the meat to our office on time.   Definitely ordering again for some of our larger catering options. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I came here with a pretty Lange group 7 in all. As far as I saw there was only 1 server! She was on her game! Very friendly efficient! The restaurant itself is incredibly clean! The only thing that was not cool.... This was our 1st visit and we assumed when the server seats you and hands you a menu they come back to take your order. We sat for a good bit before realizing we had to get up to order! Only tip I have for the staff is to make sure this is known! Ok I had pulled pork onion rings hush puppies and slaw! All I can say is wow! Holy melt in your mouth delicious! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and hospitality; they worked with specific food allergies and accommodated children with toys and coloring, which was nice after a long road trip. The food was very tasty and we will definitely stop on by the next time we visit because who can resist authentic North Carolina BBQ?"}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in while heading out of Charlotte. We got the full run down of the menu upon walking in, including what all is made and smoked in house. We weren't super hungry so we split the pulled pork slider trios with a side of hush puppies and they went so far as to give us an extra slider no charge so we'd have an even split! The 3 amigos sauce was awesome and the hush puppies were some of the best I've had. Would come back in a heart beat! Just wish we lived closer."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm here pretty often for lunch, and have brought along others who have fallen in love with this place. The food is always consistant, so it is always great tasting. I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like."}
