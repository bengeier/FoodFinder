{"text":"We recently discovered Crust.  We went for the pizza and have returned for the dining experience.   We dine out several times a week and this restaurant rises above the rest.  The pizza is amazing but we keep returning for the appetizers, pastas, drinks and more.  The desserts are worth saving room for!  This establishment does everything right. The staff are professionals in service they have great intuition about your pace and overall epicurean adventure."}
{"text":"We love going to crust for an evening out. One night we had a lot of little ones with us and the waitress was so patient and helpful. The food arrived quickly and was gobbled down. It was delicious. It was a wonderful family night and I would definitely recommend crust. It is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Disregard the \"get what you pay for ya'll\" guy on the $10 pizza; he doesn't even know where the apostrophe goes in \"y'all.\" 

The $10 pizza offered on Sundays is much better than any DiGiorno, the only problem with it is that it isn't actually 20 inches. I used to work at a place that had 20 inch pies and I remember having to fold the annoyingly big box. When I saw this box, I was skeptical of the size. When the wife and I got it home, we went anal and measured it. Sure enough, not 20\". It was like 16\" or 17\"; that said, it's still a big pizza for $10- just not sure why they'd lie when you can measure the box and see it is 18\" or whatever. 

Still, pizza was surprisingly tasty and plenty hot. Maybe try getting there to get your pizza on time, dude. Not sure why anyone would want a pie that's been sitting under a heat lamp, anyhow."}
{"text":"I had the opposite experience of Jesse. My coworker got the slice & drink deal and really enjoyed it so one day we went back to get a thin crust pie. It's the perfect crust, so I can understand why they are named such. I like how it's thin on the bottom but has a good ring around the outside. The cheese and ingredients were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I was one of their biggest fans. The pizza, as well as the other food, was always a treat. I was a regular...but then something happened. I can't explain it, but the previous visit evidenced a dramatic decline in quality. The pizza was lacking...cheese. I mean, it was there to some extent, but it was merely a fraction of what should have been there. I thought it was a one-off and gave them a second chance. All hopes were dashed with missing orders, robust excuses, interminable wait time, and staff that seemed to be in way over their heads. The quality of the food was nowhere near where it should have been and the service was worse."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night with my daughter.  Loved it.  Great food and very accommodating wait staff."}
{"text":"Food was very good, nothing new, just prepared very well. Good price for the amount of food. The wait staff seemed they could not be happier, must be into the wine, just kidding. One slight problem that other people noticed, being loud in the room and our party was causing it. We were in the corner of the glass windows and sound reflected well from there. Need some low slung drapes there. This place will become a regular stop."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic food! Garlic knots & authentic marinara is wonderful. Had cheese calzone & Greek salad - everything was seasoned perfectly & flavors well-balanced. Extra points for using pitted Greek olives instead of leaving the pits in or - ugh! - black olives like some places. An extra-special treat was the cannoli - perfect sweet bite to finish off the meal. If you enjoy excellent Italian flavors definitely make this your next stop for a meal."}
{"text":"I must admit.  Having lived in Italy and being from Chicago, it's been difficult to find a charming place to get good Italian food.  Noelle is probably one of the best bartender's/servers I've ever encountered, the food and wine is just the icing on the cake!  My boyfriend and I have made this our \"local spot\" for date night and would/have put the word out about this hidden gem in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So I decided to come back when a different sever was working. I learned they have an awesome special for a $10 20\" cheese thin crust pizza on Sunday's and Monday's. The lady before me added pepperoni on that item and it looked and smelled amazing so I decided to get that as well. This time I was helped by a gentleman named Jessie who showed me the extensive alcohol selections which are limited but upscale and right for the atmosphere that Crust has. Jessie was funny, personable, helped me get an issue I was having promptly and accurately solved, and invited me to come back Saturday or Sunday nights when he works so next time I come it will probably be on one of those days (More than likely Sunday because of the awesome pizza special!) All in all this visit makes up for the poor experience last time I was in and the food is good as ever. Everyone should come here and check it out at least once as long as their experience is an enjoyable one, which starts and ends with service so thank you Jessie!"}
{"text":"The pizza has always been pretty good here. However, we had an AWFUL experience with customer service. Unfortunately, they have now lost our business."}
{"text":"OK so this is my second review only because I was so impressed with the calzone! This was the tastiest calzone I have had. Two cheeses, the meat balls and sausage, oh and the marinara sauce. Order some extra you will want it and will not want to wait for it. I have now had there Rustica pizza, appetizers, chef specials that have all been great, but needed to tell you about the calzone. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Location is very small. Service has never been real great. Food was just so so. Not real exciting."}
{"text":"This place is terrific!  We stopped in on a Sunday night, and there were just a few happy diners.  The ambiance is nice; it's a small restaurant with patio seating in front.  It is warmly lit and the staff was relaxed and friendly.  Garlic knots and sauce are a must for appetizers. The Rigatoni Sausage entr√©e is fab.  The sauce is to die for; sweet and spicy.  The Linguini Bistecca is rich and flavorful.  I had a Rustica (personal) Arugula and Prosciutto pizza and it was delish.  There was way too much food for us and we have another meal tomorrow.  We'll be back to Crust.  Much better than we expected!"}
{"text":"Top notch service at normal prices!  Great food.  Patio is quite pleasant.  Big fan!!"}
{"text":"On vacation in Scottsdale and just tried Crust based off positive reviews here on Yelp.  Very glad we did and we arrived at early dinner time since we're with 3 children. Grabbed a nice table on the patio which is covered and made it cool enough to enjoy our dinner. Service was attentive & friendly!  Started with the Meatball sliders (all beef ) that came on a nice toasted bun & Marinara with some kick to it; and a Caesar Salad. Both were delicious! I had the Shrimp  Fra Diavolo & my wife had Linguine with Red clam sauce. Portion size  was perfect and they were not skimpy with the  shrimp or whole baby clams! I will definitely return & would recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to authentic NY pizza in Arizona. Love it!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last night with my wife and son. The personal pizzas are great. My picky son loved his. These are not your little pizzas - they are a meal. The Garlic knots were well seasoned and not too heavy.The sauce had little chunks of tomato and very tasty. I had the Chicken Marsala and it was great. The pasta was perfect and the chicken was not dry. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Crust today for lunch. The restaurant was almost empty and we were told to sit anywhere. The server came over quickly and took our drink orders. We ordered the garlic knots. The looked like bread biscuits covered in fresh garlic. They were stacked in  pyramid and were a lot for an appetizer. They were very garlicky and came with a tomato dipping sauce. The sauce was very bland. It tasted almost as if it were from a jar. I ordered the two slices of pizza lunch. The pizza was prepared well but was made with the same bland tomato sauce. It was basically tomato flavored with no apparent seasoning. I grew up on Brooklyn NY pizza. Other than it had the same slice shape, there was no other similarity. We will not be returning. The service was very good."}
{"text":"Crust is the best pizza joint in Phoenix.  Servers are great and very personable.  Rustic - delicious!  And the tortellini is to die for - great cream sauce.   Will return for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Well that was a waste of money.  The lasagna lacked flavor.  The eggplant parm's sauce was decent but the eggplant had a cornbread consistency.  The bruschetta was sadly burnt as were the dinner rolls.  Wanted to like this place but couldn't."}
{"text":"I moved to Scottsdale last year and ate here my first month in town.  I'v been back over a dozen times and eaten half a dozen different things and they are all amazing.  

Their pizza (specifically the Grandpa's... a NY pie with Sausage, Pepper & Onion) is one of my top 3 favorite of all time!  If you like chicken parmesan then you're going to start loving chicken parmesan when you try theirs. The garlic knots are fantastically garlicky.  Even their salads (Greek AND Caesar) are really flavorful.  The portions are sizeable and even when you get their food to-go it tastes as great as in the restaurant.  (speaking of which, the North Phoenix Crust offers killer pizza deals on Sun and Mon)

The staff is great. The restaurant (the one on Bell and Tatum) isn't huge but we've never had a problem getting a table without waiting.

I really can't rave enough about this place.  

If want to try someplace new where you can be sure you're going to get a great meal, this is it!"}
{"text":"This was mine and my girlfriend's? first time eating at this restaurant. We heard about it through Uber Eats. Upon delivery, my veal parmesan was so ridiculously burned, it was inedible. I'm afraid to ask how the food even left the restaurant in that condition. I called the restaurant and the manager was very nice and advised she'd give me a $20 credit on my next visit. However, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a great Italian restaurant for a long time...our search ended here.  This place rocks!!!! First off, they have Peroni...I'm a happy man.  As for food, I'm still working my way through the menu but I have NOT been disappointed yet.  The Filet Mignon sliders are absolutely to die for.  They're a meal on their own.  Love, Love, Love them!!!  The pizza is so absolutely awesome, you'd think you were in heaven.  Their pizzas are so huge that they only bring half out to you at a time.  And they're so awesome they keep the rest warm and ready in the back.  If you can't finish it (and I'd be surprised if you could), they package it up and it's ready for take home.  Their cannoli are so yummy (and cheap) that you might just want to stuff your pockets for the drive home.  The ambiance of this place is authentic Italian bistro.  A great date night for the loved one in your life. We'll be back again, and again, and again..."}
{"text":"I was in a bit of a rush when I went here, so I didn't get the full experience.  Still, it's a cozy shop that's very inviting with quick, friendly service and good food.  

I had a cheese calzone (wasn't sure if a pizza would arrive quickly enough, but now I'm curious) that was cooked perfectly, with its cheesy, saucy guts spilling all over the plate quite deliciously.  Also got to try the fettuccine alfredo, which had a surprisingly light yet enjoyable sauce, and the chicken parmesan, which was quite tasty.

Had I had time to grab a drink, appetizer or dessert, maybe I could have formulated a more well-rounded review.  Guess I'll have to do that next time."}
{"text":"My favorite things about this place are their baked mac & cheese, wine and their canolies. 

I should really try more things, but I'm pretty sure you'll be pleased with anything you have here.

Great for dining in or takeout."}
{"text":"I live right behind Crust at Tatum & Bell Rd and I go there as often as possible.  I have a 19 yr old and a 35 yr old and when they come to visit and we want pizza Crust is where we go!!  I am go excited that they moved in the neighborhood  when they did!!!  I can't pick one thing over another I love all their food!!"}
{"text":"So this is very thin crust which is awesome if you're into that but because of the lack of dough the paste comes off as very acidic and bitter. 

This is besides the point. The pizza comes out shaped like penis. What? Yes. A penis. You can try and and argue that it looks like a pizza spade but it is clearly a phallic image."}
{"text":"I was solo last night for dinner, so I decided to try Crust for a take out pizza.  Being from Chicago, I always order from Rosait's, but seeing that Crust was even closer, I thought I would give them a try.  Excellent pizza!  Ordered a basic sausage and mushroom pizza, and the crust was solid and I have to say the pizza was less greasy than Rosati's.  Didn't check to see if they have a frequent buyer program. but if they do, I may make them my regular take out."}
{"text":"Best item on the menu: chicken or eggplant parm sandwich. Their house-made sauce is just right...not too sweet. Little bit chunky. During football season, their monday night pizza deal is super for a crowd. Like most great food in phoenix, it's in a nondescript strip mall. Nice happy hour."}
{"text":"This was my very first time eating here and we decided to eat here on 7/31 because a friend of mine always wanted to try this place out. I would say overall the food was really good but the space was a little too tight in the dining area of the restaurant. My reasons of rating this a two-star is because of our waitress which I believe her name was Emily (this was the name given to me by the busser). I was there with my husband and another couple, in which we all are in our mid thirties, and I ordered a glass of wine, my friend a glass of wine, and my husband and my friend's husband both ordered a beer. For some strange reason I was the only person she carded. When I told the waitress she had to card everyone else as well in fairness she acted as if she wanted to push my buttons and only continued to ask for mine avoiding what I said without any explanation. From my understanding if anyone looks under the age of 55 then they need to be carded; however, this was not the case. I did feel that she was discriminating towards me in particular and even took everyone else's order first when my friend interrupted her and told her to take mine. 

While exiting the restaurant I did meet the owner (Michael???) because my friend actually knew him and stopped to chat with him for a little. I did want to express my concern with the owner when he asked how everything was but I didn't feel it was the appropriate time to complain to him since he was there with his family that involved kids."}
{"text":"At first, we were the only ones in the place...but several other tables followed us in. This was my first time in this new place and I had no idea what to expect. I liked the atmosphere and d√©cor, simple. Personally I felt the TVs detracted from the d√©cor, but I admit they entertained my son because they were playing sports. The inside is small. It was difficult to have a private conversation, and unfortunately an obnoxious patron came in just after our arrival and sat on the other side of the restaurant...but that is another story for another day. 

We had the chicken parmesean rollatini, a sun-dried tomato ravioli special and a custom Hawaiian style rustica pizza. I had never had a 'rollatini,' it was similar to a Stromboli. It was good, a little too much bread for me, but that is because I like thin crust. The portion size was large, I only ate  1/2.  The Rustica pizza was very good, nice crispy crust, I like the sauce and the toppings covered the complete pizza. My son loved it.  Again, we took left-overs home. The Sun-dried tomato ravioli had a mix of alfredo and red sauce, which is one of my favorite combinations. I did not find the alfredo sauce too heavy and overall it was a nice dish, again a nice portion.  For dessert, we had a homemade brownie and cookie with ice cream--that was delicious as well. 

We also had a bottle of wine, which as compared to other pizza/Italian places in the area, I found reasonably priced. Most of their bottles ranged from $27-40; where I have been in some places and you can't find a bottle under $32.00.
 
Our service was great. I felt bad for the servers working because they also didn't know how to handle the obnoxious women disrupting the entire restaurant with her trailer trash conversation while completely either ignoring or yelling at her child - it was a tough situation for them - but we never felt ignored and they loaded our son up on Sprite.  I would say the only problem with the open seating is the size and all the tile and wood creates an echo instaed of absorbing the conversation. You could literately hear everyone else's conversation without trying that hard.
 
Overall, good quality food at a reasonable price. I will continue to recommend this place."}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious!  I'm from Chicago, so I'm pretty picky.  The entrees are good too, but it's the pizza that keeps me coming back.  You can't beat their take-out special on Sunday and Monday nights...ten bucks for a large cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Great small pizza place love their crust. Makes sense that that's what their  best at. Love their Launch slice special. 4.95 for 2 slices and a drink. Greatfriendly staff. It truly is a one stop place for italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place! Great service! A must try. Especially the rusticas and meatballs."}
{"text":"Had the little John pizza the first time there and it was excellent (if you love meat). Went back on a Sunday for the $9.99 20\" thin crust. It was a little bland and the crust was softer than I like in a thin crust pizza but overall not bad. Stay away from the mozzarella appetizer, it's just deep fried frozen mozzarella triangles. Those could be improved."}
{"text":"Nice place. Hidden in a strip mall next to Dunkin Donuts. East coast flair to the pizza. Rollatinis, Pizza Rusticas are excellent. Love the meatball sliders. House wine is quite nice, too. Really pleasant service."}
{"text":"first time my friend and I went there... it was delicious!  The food, garlic knots our favorite and of course the wine!  We will be going back ALOT!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are amazing, also see the garlic muscles, chicken piccata and Rita's ices next door :-)"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, delicious food and full bar.  My wife was happy with their super dirty martini after the Lon drive to Scottsdale. Calzone and chicken parm a must."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great appetizers, great pizza, amazing pasta. They customized my menu item for any type of pasta any type of meat, artichoke instead of tomatoes etc. would recommend this place if you like casual Italian restaurant with good food."}
{"text":"Pizza here rocks. Their chicken Frances is fantastic. The housewine one of the best I've ever had. And I'm 100% Italian... you know what I mean!"}
{"text":"Best meal of our vacation-thanks yelpers for helping me find another amazing meal. Our big group was served by Ian-he made sure our dining experience was perfect. We ordered 12 different items and each one was exceptional. For apps don't miss garlic knots or cheese board, pasta and pizza's were amazing, and due to the huge portions, even better the next day! Dessert recommendation-cheesecake, ice cream sandwich and bite size cannoli. 
."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ok pizza.. But places like these are a dime a dozen and if you don't have your sh*t together, sorry I won't be back.

Also, there's a reason why they're offering the garlic knots for free.. Gross."}
{"text":"Nice counter kid \"Cody\" , \"Weiner Pizza\" was good but NOT the traditional style YUCK! ANyway $5 is good cheap and okay!"}
{"text":"This is a delicious little restaurant 
we called in an order and picked it up they were very friendly
We ordered the skinny chicken pesto pizza which comes on whole wheat is very flavorful and thin crust
We also ordered the chicken crust salad which was decent for salad
We signed up for text alerts which gave us a free order of garlic knots which were delicious, there was A ton of garlic they were really FATTENING but they were good to dip in the marinara sauce!
We definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"Was there last night.
Place was busy.First time there and I did a pizza pick up.
Pizza was just what we wanted.Thin sliced and was 20 in. One.price was not bad for a large pizza.
Sauce was great and good amount  of cheese.Bottom nice and brown and no air bubbles.
Will return for sure."}
{"text":"#FAIL #DeathOfTheAmericanDream

Can't tell you how irritating it is to me to see a grand opening and nobody on quality control.

Cheese and ingredients were unmelted and cold atop a crust that was cool in the center. The thin crust was cooked all the way through but the ingredients were gloppy and unpleasant. I complained, no offer was made to refund us for our troubles.

This appears to be another location for Crust Pizza & Wine, which has some pretty good reviews. Perhaps I should stop holding Scottsdale pizza to NY standards. More likely: somebody from corporate needs to check up on the new location."}
{"text":"I was searching for a place to take my friend who was visiting America from Azerbaijan. This place was located nearby and we thought we'd try it. 

We hadn't seen each other for 3 years so we sat and chatted for 3 hours. The waitress was nice and let us be, but the busboys kept asking us if we wanted a box for our food. I think they were trying to be attentive, not push us out. 

The food was just Okay. We ordered the Rustica pizza, which is an appetizer pizza shaped like a penis and balls. That was awkward and we dug in to offset the shape. We also had the garlic knots, which, again, were just Okay. 

The staff were mostly nice. They filmed the \"ice bucket challenge\" outside while we were there, which was neat to watch. 

Not sure if I'd go back, but it wasn't half bad either."}
{"text":"Nice place to have lunch or dinner.  At lunch you can get two slices of cheese pizza and a soft drink for one low price extra toppings are available at extra cost.  Church the daily featured items.  You can get traditional sandwiches and pastas as well.  They also have a full bar.  You should also check out My Pie really good personal pizza made how you want it one at a time or have a salad."}
{"text":"Meatball sliders, bruschetta, and garlic knots.  They were amazing and the ingredients were super fresh.  All topped with great service!!"}
{"text":"First visit was great. Second visit 4 different staff visited our table multiple times. It was very confusing who our waiter actually was. Our pizza was burnt. Might give another try, but not sure how they're known for their great pizza."}
{"text":"Weirdly not at all busy at 6pm on a Saturday... 

Had the meatball sliders and garlic knots. Way too much garlic on the knots made them a mushy, tasteless mess. Sliders came with a spicy marinara that was pretty oily. I'd ask for regular marinara instead. We added the fresh mozzarella to the sliders and they were good. 

The chicken francese was delicious. Also had the Mac and cheese pizza after seeing pics of it on yelp. It's not on the menu and we were told you have to pay for both the Mac and cheese dinner AND pizza to get it. That was disappointing, but we still wanted to try it. It was good, not amazing, as reviewed. Also had the godmother pizza, which was okay. The pesto and marinara combo was a strange combo. 

There's also no kids menu. They said they could do a half order of regular pasta. Hmmm. 

Ended with butter cake and the cookie sandwich. The cookies tasted like store bakery cookies (not good ones) and the butter cake was just okay. FYI - Arrowhead Grill has the best butter cake I've had. 

Might try it again sometime, but that's after we exhaust a long list of Italian restaurants in the area. Determined to find good Italian food in AZ!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to pizza last night. We were very disappointed to find a terribly undercooked Pizza when we got home.

I have since been contacted by the ownership and invited back to try again. They were Very concerned and reactive to my bad review. I will give it another try."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail for CRUST--$10 off for $30 spent.  I thought that this was a great opportunity to try out a new restaurant.  

Upon arrival we had our choice of seating.  The place has a very casual style with a few booths and several tables (sans table cloths).  Jackie who appears part of management as well as a server approached us about a wine order.  We had just sat down and didn't even know what we wanted to drink.  We reviewed the wine menu but weren't interested in their offerings.  We were asked again but it felt kind of pushy.  Jackie seems to have a problem smiling and was not very cordial.  We value positive interactions with servers and did not get any here.  

We ordered rigatoni with meatballs and chicken marsala with linguini.  Both portions were ample and hubby enjoyed his chicken marsala which also came with an over baked crescent roll.  The meatballs were average tasting but not too bad.  The meat had been overworked during preparation so the meatballs were not tender.  The more you work the meat, the harder the meatball turns out.  The sauce on the rigatoni had too much oregano for my own taste but that is a subjective matter.  I am sure someone would have enjoyed it.  I packed the food to go home with the hopes that someone will eat it.  
 
I usually don't worry about environment as long as the food is good.  But I am making an exception here.  There was a lack of warmth in this establishment perpetuated by the \"hardness of the server\" (Not the momma-to-be---she was nice).   The place is not welcoming so I see it more of a take-out place than a place where you can sit and enjoy meal.  
Having a coupon took the sting out of eating here.  
This felt like a 2 Star place because the food is just average and the staff doesn't do anything to make you feel good about being there.  I am throwing in one extra star for the dark ale beer we enjoyed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Best food ever and phenomenal service as well.  First time there but definitely not the last. Thanks to the Forward Tilt team for an amazing lunch!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER

I know I'm going to struggle with this review. Certain experiences defy the use of words and so the writer claws his way through them, often applying far too *many* words in his attempts.

I've been searching for \"the perfect New York style pizza\" for over a decade. Having grown up on the east coast, \"authentic\" NY style pizza holds a special place in my memory.

THE EXPERIENCE

Upon entering Crust Pizzeria, I was immediately and warmly greeted and told that I could feel free to choose my own seating. I settled in at a large booth.

I decided to order the Garlic Knots for an appetizer and paired that to a nice glass of Malbec. I then ordered \"The NY\" pizza - aptly named to my sentiments.

The wine was delicious, the garlic knots, too. The service was also outstanding. My server was sweet and attentive - very smiley and genuine. I appreciated this very much.

Knowing I'd eat the leftovers, I ordered the 20\" round. When it arrived, it was delivered in half. The server informed me that this was to keep the other half warm. (A really great idea!)

The slices were large, as they should be for that east coast experience. Something about the smell of the pizza in particular triggered a distinct sense of familiarity.

TIME TRAVEL

I helped myself to a slice, folded it, then took my first bite. Immediately, I was overwhelmed with a wave of nostalgia. All the sudden, I was back on Maple Ave. in South Plainfield, NJ.

Forgive the mawkish description, but I had just bitten into a taste of my childhood! It floored me. I had to put the pizza down on the plate and catch my breath.

This was the pizza I had been searching for all this time! THIS was a New York style pizza!! After composing myself, I got back to work on THE BEST PIZZA I had ever eaten.

CONCLUSION

I was very excited to learn that Crust runs a special on Sunday and Monday nights: just $10 for a takeout order of the 20\" pizza I had sitting in front of me.

Do I intend to go back to Crust Pizzeria? Absolutely. Would I recommend it? Wholeheartedly! Crust has earned its spot as King of the Hill in my book. It is the #1 Best Pizza in the Valley, hands down.

If you haven't been, you need to find your way there for a visit. Dine in for a wonderful service experience or order takeout and enjoy a sweet deal on the food! You will NOT be disappointed. I know I wasn't."}

Saw your comment and decided without hesitation to order 2-20\" Mushrooms pizzas last night for take out. Took them home and demolished them watching the Steeler's game. The pizza's were delicious and the service was lightning fast. Thank you!"}
{"text":"1st time here and maybe it's because I'm not a NY pizza lover..but this place to me is just an average pizza place.  They offer a carry out deal on Sunday's and Monday's of 20\" cheese pizza for $10, which is a deal..a small upcharge for extra ingredients.  So I fired that up and needless to say...was very disappointed.  I'd rather have bought a DiGiorno store bought pizza.  The pizza was cold as hell when I picked it up too, I don't even think they have heaters/warmers.  Sometimes you get what you pay for ya'll..."}
{"text":"The stars are for the ambiance this place has, otherwise the food leaves something to be desired...we went here on 1/23/16 and the food was surprisingly very average...I was surprised because I read the reviews and everyone seems so in love with this place. The Husband and I were really disappointed. We ordered the garlic knots as an appetizer and talk about overkill. My husband said, bread must be cheap here...because they give you like 10 knots that are the size of an apple. Who eats that much bread as an appetizer? They should have size options. Outside of the quantity, the taste was bland bland bland...yes there was TONS of fresh garlic lumped on top, but the bread was just bland, the flavor wasn't quite there..we had two each and then there were about 6 huge knots left staring us in the face...for the pizza we ordered half East Coast Grandma and half Uncle Louie...the East Coast Gma was below average and in my opinion tasted just like the garlic knots.....the Louie was just OK...we wanted to like this place since we live right down the street, but this will not be our go to spot for pizza and wine... :("}
{"text":"Cute place, great pizza!   The sauce they use is really good , excellent flavor, and the thin crust is nicely crisp and delicious.

Great meal and it only came to $25!!"}

{"text":"Food was really good, but I haven't tried the pizza. Really liked the rigatoni, and the atmosphere was nice. Took off 1 star as the service was very slow, but if food is what matters you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!!! Amazing dinner. I never write reviews but just had to write my first one. Stopped in to Crust on Bell about 6pm. My first thought was that it was small and there were very few people. That's never a good sign. Then people started filing in. Just by what I saw it looks like their take-outs are their bread and butter. If so, that's a shame. We had a great waiter and their menu offered quite a lot. First we tried the garlic knots. You get about 10 good sized knots for about 4.50. They were spectacular. If you love garlic like we do, definitely try these. Then I had the special which was Filet and gorgonzola. Their meals are served on big blocks of wood. Which was really interesting. Anyway, my meal was so wonderful I think I dreamt about it all night! If I could, I would go back tonight. YUM!!! The filet was cooked perfectly. I got about 4 skewers of filet with gorgonzola sauce and fried mozzarella(sp). with arugula. (I didn't eat the salad) . My hubby got the rollotini and he was very happy with his. We will definitely be going back. And Crust, if you read this, please keep the filet and gorgonzola on your menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Hard to find, it's off to the side of a shopping center that contains a Walmart and a pet store. 

The prices were reasonable and the flavors were fine. Crust was crunchy. It wasn't as casual as I thought it would be. It's a bit upscale, like a Scottsdale vibe. 

Bonus that there's a custard place next door for easy dessert."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Their salads are served in a seasoned bread bowl - how unique!  I had their chicken ceasar salad and caprese salad.  Both were fresh and delicious.  Nice wine selection and food came out fast.  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place was quite nice. Although their original NY pizza was a little too bland for me, there was a quality about it that I liked, and it really reminded me of NY pizza. The service was great. My only real complaint is that if you order a whole pizza, they only bring out 1/2 of the pizza at a time. At first this was confusing to us, but the waiter explained that they keep the other half warm for you in the back until you're ready. The only problem with this is that I felt like the 2nd half of the pizza tasted a little reheated. So I'm not sure if it's in the back sitting under a heat lamp or actually put back into the oven (not to mention we had to wait a bit for the 2nd half to come out). I will return to Crust, but next time I'll just request that we get the whole pizza at once."}
{"text":"The food is so so. We ordered the Grandma's pie, garlic knots and crusted mac & cheese. The pie had a plain taste, no flavor. The garlic knots were ok, my kids always like breadsticks but they didn't like these knots at all. The only thing we all really liked was the mac & cheese, great favor - kiddos loved it. 

This place is in our neighborhood and now I can say we've finally tried it, however I highly doubt we'll return because of the $$$ for not great favor."}
{"text":"Guess we should have went with the pizza?! We had the antipasto salad and shrimp scampi. The antipasto was okay, the lettuce was very limp it seemed as though the dressing was put on much earlier in the day. The salad was very bland and lifeless! As for the scampi, there was zero flavor except for the cheap white wine that it was made with. I was expecting more for $19 a plate. If I ever make it in again I will get the pizza!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service and Great prices!!!

Cozy environment with good music playing throughout the night!  Service was exceptional - all staff very polite and attentive.

Garlic knots were exceptional - both the knots and the sauce!  Meatball sliders melt in your mouth and Peanut butter dessert was delicious too!  Forgot the name but only one with peanut butter.  Everything we had was delish but these items really stuck out.

Give them a try I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Crust ingredients are always fresh, and new daily specials are always a delight.  The staff is fantastic!  Great happy hour deals, and craft beer changes, so you get a good variety."}
{"text":"I was in love w this place when I first moved to N Phx.   
I'm really disappointed to give 1 star now.  
I ordered the Palermo Sicilian (I don't order regular or thin because it's sopping wet crust) 
Well, not only has the past few Sicilian pies been wet (gross) but last night, it was barely cooked! 
All produce wet cold and barely cooked. Just enough to melt the fresh mozz. 
Sorry Crust, you fell off bad! Get it together please."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  They have the best calamari and meatball sliders!  Amazing happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine, my kids and now some of our friends. I am confused by some reviews. To say the pizza has no flavor? Idk. We order it every Monday night. It is a huge pizza and delicious. I love the garlic knots and the Mac n cheese is the bomb. I am eating it right now as I type. I have been a fan of crust for 4 years. I use to go to the Scottsdale location frequently and was thrilled to see it open up in my neck of the woods. The servers are great. The place is clean. And I definitely still think it is the best pie around. It's the closest I have found to the NY pizza I miss. I guess to each is own!"}
{"text":"Worst rudest experience, we were treated  with distain,like we were a burden on them for asking for service or questions! walked out never would give them a second chance we were amazed!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for good home style authentic Italian! The Lasagna is amazing! We order the Garlic Knots every time we come and the service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant. Fine food  great staff, good bargains . Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Small, cozy location with good selections. Ask for Jackie to wait upon your table, we been here several times and had a few hiccups, but I seem to keep returning because I do like the service & food"}
{"text":"The food is good but their policy on saving one table for a larger party and turning regular customers away doesn't make sense to me.  We attempted twice on two different occasions to dine in the restaurant and Ian the waiter refused to allow us to sit at that table in anticipation of a bigger party that might possibly show up. I just don't understand the logic. We won't return which is a shame because it is a small local business which I prefer to support. If they change their policy maybe we will try again but not until then!"}
{"text":"Always great!  One of the best pizza crusts in the valley.  Nice happy hour specials too.  Also a big fan of their MyPie custom pizza place down the street."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed this pizza (we got it to go). Pepp pizza is at the base of my food pyramid, so let's just say, I know what I'm talking about. We got the thin crust version, which was a nice balance of crispy/chewy. Not too greasy, and the pepps satisfied. Would certainly return."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times already. They are always very nice and accommodating.  This one is closer to my home, so even though the menu is a little smaller, it doesn't matter as long as I can have my original rustica.   I love that pizza, it is the perfect crust with delicious creamy mozzarella and the right amount of tomato sauce.  I had a glass of the Malbec last time and it paired really nice with the pizza.  My husband had the soup of the day and it was really good.  Hearty and a little spicy, he was glad he ordered the bowl instead of a cup. I recommend this place to my mom's night out group."}
{"text":"Very nice cuisine. Casual atmosphere, but first rate creative, scratch made quality dishes. Their plates can stand right along side an expensive white table cloth restaurants offerings. Super personable staff, that is genuinely interested in your pleasant dining experience. It's more than just-a-job to all of the staff.......
  This is an additional restaurant to the highly rated Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe in Scottsdale. They have nailed this one as well."}
{"text":"Still the best pizza nearby been going here 2 years now. Every thing is good. Canoli's are fresh and delicious. They run specials all the time and text me coupons and promos."}
{"text":"Just finished my first \"Crust\" pizza.  Holy Moly!!! Good stuff.  I'm very impressed as I don't think there are a lot of good pizza joints in Phoenix.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service but over priced for the food. Over-sauced spaghetti and soggy veal. Undercooked and plain-tasted pizza- not worth the money. Sorry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this restaurant. The staff is attentive and obviously care about making sure you have a good experience. We love the rusticas- add argula to it- so yummy!! It has a good happy hour and nice patio. They recently started carrying more local beers which we appreciate."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night.  It was great!  It is small and quaint.  Our waitress was perfect and the bus boy made sure our table was never overcrowded with empty plates.  The Original Rustica pizza was delicious.  The calamari was excellent and the stromboli was amazing.  On Mondays, they offer half-off bottles of wine.  Hoping to go every Monday!"}
{"text":"Excellent local pizza and Italian food location.  Must order the garlic knots.  Great wine selection.  Ian was a great server."}
{"text":"Tried the tomato basil pizza then the cheese .The cheese pizza had almost no sauce at all. However, the staff is friendly and the service is great. It's pretty expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Do not miss this opportunity!  Everything that you have positively read about this restaurant is true and accurate.  Excellent service from both Justin & Jessie, quality food; garlic knots to die for; 20\" pizzas are awesome; prices very reasonable.  I will be back often.  Thank you for a very enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to crust after living in the area for a little over a year.  My girlfriend and I are regulars at MyPie and we thought it was about time we tried out the other store in the family. 

We placed an order to go which included an order of garlic knots, penne pesto cream pasta with shrimp and the Mac and cheese with chicken and a cannoli to finish it off. 

The Mac and cheese with chicken was quite tasty.  Good flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  It could use a little more sauce though and it seemed to harden in little clumps quite fast but it could be part of the fact it's a baked Mac and cheese.  Still delicious either way though.  

The penne with pesto was the best thing of the night.  Seasoned perfect, and the pesto sauce was delicious.  Great all around dish.  

The one disappointment were the garlic knots.  We have gotten the garlic knots at MyPie a few times and for some reason every time we order them they we are always hopeful they will be different but they are normally dry and just not what we are expecting.  Well we discovered they are the same garlic knots at crust.  It could just be a personal taste thing with the garlic knots because I know most people rave about them.  To each their own I suppose. 

Lastly the cannoli's were a great way to end the meal.  They are quite small though for 1.50 a piece.  

We will have to try staying for dinner as the place looked quite quaint and had a great small Italian old school feel.  Definitely recommend this place for some great Italian food at regular joe prices."}
{"text":"OMG.  I had a delicious..I mean, ridiculous, Chicken entree with Lemon/Butter sauce to die for.  Fresh bread and pasta...amazing.
Caprese salad was not what I expected.  I don't want lettuce with my tomatoes and mozzerella.
For a little strip mall restaurant, it blew me away.  My husband isn't a fan of strip mall restaurants...the ambience isn't much to be desired.  
But, man, the food was top-notch!"}
{"text":"After our second visit I feel obligated to share my thoughts with anyone from the East coast.  On both occasions the cook (not chef) overcooked even the veal, burnt edges?   The pizza  (both kinds) was the worst I've had in the 35 years of eating the valley's offerings.  Greasy, flopping, wet and burnt, and they have the balls to name this place Crust!   If the owners ever read this stuff they should pay attention to their Tatum & Bell location.  The wait staff was fantastic, the cook should seek other employment opportunities, maybe landscaping.  Or at very least send him to N.Y. to try an example of what he is trying to do!   Calamari was left in the fryer so long it was like eating a light bulb, they did correct it but the harm was done.  NEVER AGAIN.  You all have been warned,  good luck."}
{"text":"Always wonderful food and super staff. We are repeaters! Best eggplant! Clean,great parking, full bar."}
{"text":"The only good thing at this location was the  waiters. Waited 35 minutes for the Caesar salad that had too much dressing and the croutons where greasy and had  too much paprika on them. Waited another 20 minutes to get the pizzas, which where average. Very disappointment. We will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food from strip mall Italian restaurant! Great presentation and attentive service from our server Ian and other staff. Very good tasting food and great variety and selection beyond just pizza and pasta. Nice portions. Did not disappoint for Friday night outing with friends. A \"quick bite\" turned into a surprisingly decent meal! Would return for sure."}
{"text":"Decent prices, GREAT food and the ambiance is awesome. It's going to be very hard to beat their white pizza. My girl and I don't agree on much when it comes to food, but this place always wins when we're deciding where to eat out. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed in this place tonight. I asked for a different kind of pasta than the menu offered with my entree... Because the waiter encouraged the fact any pasta is substitutable. It came out with the original pasta. The place was definitely busy, and I thought instead of complaining I'd eat my dinner (minus any pasta) and hope when they boxed up my leftovers it would be fixed... I mentioned the mix up to the waiter and he offered NO fix. I even said, \"don't box the linguine since it was a mistake. I'm not a fan of. \". Ummm.... I was a waitress. I know how I would have replied and fixed the situation. Not to mention the front door was open all throughout. I think it's 50 degrees outside. I don't need my food to cool off any faster than normal. And didn't get the memo to bring my winter coat to wear during dinner. Won't let my boyfriend talk me into this place again. Even tho he is friendly with the staff."}
{"text":"Great service.  Didn't care for my pizza. Family loved theirs. Great cold draft beer"}
{"text":"So I normally like my pizza with several toppings. I like to have everything on it. So obviously I'm not big on just pepperoni or cheese pizza, but I've got to say they have the best tasting ordinary pizza out there. And obviously their name gives away that they have good crust. Pretty yummy. My favorite place to go to for ordinary pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Their pizza and pasta are very good! We tried Isa's right around the corner from us tonight and it was awful. We'll be driving the extra distance to go to Crust from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Really good food. Would highly recommend if looking for pasta or pizza. Get the garlic knots and sangria. Too full to have dessert."}
{"text":"Soooooo good & this is 1 picky pizza eater. PERFECT crust not too thick not too thin, super saucy high quality ingredients , excellent staff plus so much else besides pizza LOVE this place...."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. We got a seat right away at 7:30 on a Friday night. Excellent pizza, shrimp parmesan, and sangria.  We had a very attentive server and overall a great experience. It's a nice neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"This is a very charming restaurant and the pizza is really good plus they have very nice specials.  The service is always excellent and the wait staff always is very attentive.  Rigatoni with Italian sausage is a favorite...."}
{"text":"Had a lunch special. A slice and a caesars. Wasn't expecting much. The salad came out first. It had beautiful romain greens, excellent dressing and a couple of nice pieces of crusty bread. My slice followed. Classic thin NY style. It didn't let down. Funny how the food biz works. Good ingredients usually equal a good experience. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I love CRUST!  Italian is my favorite food. And I'm always looking for a good place. This was beyond my expectations! The chicken Parmigiana melts in your mouth it was scrumptious!! They have a great atmosphere and the service was excellent! 

They have great specials! I will definitely become a regular of this place!!"}
{"text":"There was only one waiter for lunch on a Sunday. It took 45 minutes to get our food and when it arrived it was not good. We also witnessed another table send their food back."}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars but I can honestly say I would like to take the fra diavolo sauce and smear it on my face like some Italian war paint. That sounds totally weird but it's that good.

We've been here twice and the meatball sliders are to die for. Soft, flavorful and a whole side of that fra diavolo sauce. Can I go back to the sauce? I ate the remaining sauce that we got on the side as if it were soup. It is so fresh. I could literally taste the fresh chopped parsley. Perfect consistency, too.

We also got the eggplant rollatini. The crust is so flavorful and the eggplant was cooked nicely and just thin enough. We split a bottle of the Hey Mambo wine which was half off and so just $14. Our whole dinner came to 35 bucks including tax and tip. We may do this every Monday just because it's too good not too. 

Yes, the service is slow but they make everything fresh and it's worth it. One lady got so mad and left becuase it had been a half hour and she still had no food. If you want great food and good ambiance, come here. If you want a meal in less than 14 minutes, go to freakin' Applebees. Have a bottle of wine and relax. Trust me. 

The only way it could be better would be if it were a little bigger and had a couch that I could take a nap on in between courses. Pretty please, could you get that?"}
{"text":"Big disappointment! After seeing another location of Crust with rave reviews on the morning news, we were so excited to find one close to us. 

Service was good, in fact the waiter told us of a special where we would save $6 on a pizza if we just took it to go instead of dining in. We relaxed and had a glass of wine while waiting.

All done and we excitedly take it home, open the box to find the pizza is burnt, not just a little, but SOLID BLACK on the bottom, think like a charcoal briquette. Ugh! 

Of course we take it back, they make us a new one with a complimentary dessert. We did check to make sure it wasn't burnt.

But guess what? The edges are nice and brown, but the middle is pure raw dough!!

This location has been here 5 years, the waiter told us. We are very surprised it's lasted that long! :("}
{"text":"Crust is a small neighborhood pizzeria.  There are a lot of Chicago style pizza places and while this one is not one of them they have the best!  Crust's Sicilian style pizza is to die for.  Their crust (of course) is phenomenal.  The staff is so great that one time our friend said he loved the Mac n cheese so much he wished they made a pizza like it,  guess what they made it!  If you are sick of Oregano's and you have not been to Crust you have to try."}
{"text":"I received an e-mail from the owner on 4/20/15 in response to my review on 3/1/15, here's an excerpt: I am certainly disappointed in the feedback as we have built a pretty loyal following over the 5 years we have been open.  I would kindly ask that you either email us personally or privately due to your experience was not one that we wronged you, but rather you just do not like our food.   If you do not like our food, I am sorry.  Publically humiliating our company does no one any good.  We are more than willing to compensate you for your poor quality meal.  If you are wanting to pick up a gift card to try something else, I can leave it with the managers in the office. 

So here's my response, I was in no way humiliating the restaurant, rather, I as a working person who came to this establishment with my hard-earned money, found the quality of the food to be poor.  My review was factual and honest based in my and my guest's experience.  I am not a professional reviewer who gets compensated or \"perked\" by restaurant owners to give an automatic positive or even false review.  I was nothing but 100% honest in my critique and that's exactly what is was a critique not publically humiliating anyone or anything.  If you take a look at some of the other more recent reviews on YELP (12/15/14, 1/18/15, 4/20/15), you will see they too shared the same sentiments as I did.  So to the owner, what you got was honesty.  Rather than asking me to e-mail you so the public does not see the truth or offer me a gift card to return (which is not even a consideration) take your critiques and make some changes.  Peace!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the service when I went in to pick up the Pizza. A++ for customer service. This was my first time trying out one of their Pizza's, but I just wasn't super thrilled after tasting it. It wasn't bad, but it just didn't give me that comfort feeling I like to have when I bite into the pizza. I will go back and just try something other than the pizza! If nothing else, the friendly atmosphere will get me in there."}
{"text":"Came here for family night out and was blown away.  We ordered the garlic knots and I loved that they weren't too doughy and had a nice light crunch.  My son got the meatball sliders and said we should come back every Friday for these alone.  As great as those were I was even more impressed with the manicotti.  The ricotta with the sauce and fresh mozzarella makes this a dish and a place we will definitely come back to. Special shoutout for our server Justin for taking care of us!  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place. Who knew? Wanted to give five stars but do not want to you to think it is a fake review as it is a pizza place in a strip mall. Nice ambiance. Calamari was good. Personal pizza was awesome & huge. Our server was attentive and friendly. All the staff were friendly. We will go back soon."}
{"text":"returned last nite, thx Crust! 1/2 priced premium bottle of wine and a KILLER veg pizza, u rocked it!"}
{"text":"Crust quickly became my favorite \"go to\" restaurant and I've shared with all my family and friends. Love the atmosphere, service and the FOOD! Have to admit the Tortellini alla Panna is my favorite, but I've enjoyed everything I've ordered! Doesn't get much better than a glass of my favorite wine (Clifford Bay Sauvignon Blanc) and Greek Salad on the patio!"}
{"text":"In love! Absolutely de-lish! I enjoyed the special of crab stuffed mushrooms w/ a salad and husband had  the lasagna.... Everything was great BUT the lasagna wasn't hot enough for my husbands liking. They graciously took it back and brought him a new plate and also gave us dessert (wasn't looking for or expecting that) we will be back for sure. We really enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"Do not know what happened tonight...We order from your restaurant all the time. Pizza was undercooked. Greek salad was a bunch of lettuce and only had 2 olives... Pizza had a tiny bit of cheese. Not good tonight!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza but I called at 4:15 today and was placed on hold for over 7 min so I decided to order a pizza from red devil during that time. When the guy finally answered the phone I asked if that was normal he didn't reply and put me on hold. Lol to many choices for pizza around here take care of your customers so they take care of you."}
{"text":"Opened under new management. Different chef. Higher prices and different menu. Pizza still best choice."}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with Crust. I stumbled upon this restaurant shortly after my fiance and I bought a house near by and it is the type of place you love to be a regular at! The prices are reasonable and the food is always so delicious!! I consider myself to be a foodie and nothing I've ever ordered on the menu has ever been less than spectacular! Apps, specials, pizzas, pastas, dessert, drinks, it all truly hits the spot. The service is always great and walking up to the shopping mall you wouldn't expect the adorable atmosphere on the inside. What a great little find!!"}
{"text":"I had the original pizza and it was amazing.  Brought our parents from NY and they loved it.  Crust is delicious!  I would recommend this place to pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Wifey and daughter stopped by and picked up the Monday night 20\" $10 pie. Really, really good, and no better value out there."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and got:

Meatball sliders with mozzarella: these were very good. The only complaint that I had that it was pretty pricey for an appetizer with 3 meatballs ($12).....

Macaroni and cheese rustica pizza: this isn't on the menu but another yelper wrote about it and we had to try it.....and we weren't disappointed. It was awesome. It's a \"personal\" pizza but plenty for 2 and it is absolutely perfect. 

The service was great, the atmosphere was great (there is a misted patio outside that's nice), and the food was excellent. We would definitely go back.....(although all the pizzas are shaped like penises and we don't know why....)"}
{"text":"Very surprised and pleased with great personal service and a very familial \"Italian\" feel to the entire experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is off to the side of the main shopping strip plaza, and has a fun cafe feel with both indoor and outdoor (patio) seating. We headed in and took a table up front by the window. We hit them for the tail-end of happy hour and ordered some garlic knots from the food menu for just $3. There were a ton of knots on the plate, and the smell was amazing. 

Spaghetti and Meatballs on a pizza?! Intrigued by the very idea of combining two foods I love, I had to go with this menu option. My pizza came out exactly as outlined on the menu - spaghetti atop pizza! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meatballs were plentiful. The crust on the pizza was cooked to be a good texture for picking up and eating, but not overwhelmingly crunchy or cardboard-like.  

The portions here are definitely shareable. We both ordered our own plates, but could easily have just shared one, since we both only ate half our plates and boxed the remainder. 

Since we were both really full we opted to just get two small canolis at the end of the meal, and they were the perfect amount of dessert to satisfy the sweet-tooth without making life regretable.  

Overall: A
Would definitely head back here when craving some Italian goodness."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here during happy hour and was greeted with a small restaurant. We sat down and our waiter was nice. We decided to order off the hh menu exclusively - everything was $5! We chose calamari, the mozzarella encorozza and the NY rustic pizza. I also got a glass of reisling. 

The food came out and it was just okay. I'm happy that our bill was around $25 before tip and we even had a doggie bag. Overall, inexpensive prices and aight food."}
{"text":"I live close by so I have been here several times dining in and take out. The salads are \"meh\", they are okay but over-priced. The pizza has always been good and we've tried them all. My favorite dish is the Mediterranean Chicken entree! Has been fantastic every time I have ordered it. I'm a big fan of Mondays as it is half off bottle of wine night.

My biggest complaint would be the service. In all the times I have been there I have never had good service. It seems that they are never in a hurry to do anything no matter how busy the place gets."}
{"text":"This place has very good N.Y. style pizza. I like to stop here on a Friday night so I can have a drink at the bar and talk to the staff while I wait for take out pizza. This place boasts a 20 inch pie and has a few unique types of combinations on the menu."}
{"text":"My boss recommended we come here for a healthier pizza.  We were waited on by the owner's daughter, who was an absolute delight!  She knew her stuff!  Loved it!  We always go there now!  The canolis are tiny but delicious and the tiramisu always hits my sweet spot.  The rustica bianco is my favorite!  The garlic knots are a steal!  There are sooo many of them!  Add cheese to make them even more yummy!"}
{"text":"Such wonderful touches made for a wonderful experience.

The five star elements:

***** Our server, Aaron.  The perfect light touch that struck the right balance of attentiveness, cordiality, and sincere service.  This fellow has a bright future in this, or any profession, that requires mastery of interpersonal communications and relations.  

*****  Surprise, surprise.  THE CRUST.  My guess is they have perfectly stoked 900 degree ovens back there, and they know exactly how to time those gorgeous rustica individual pizzas so they turn out just right.  My FAVORITE PIZZA CRUST IN PHOENIX, ranking higher than Pizzeria Blanco or any other of those other so-called elite places.  This crust beats the pants off of the ordinary neighborhood pizza places as well.

***** The CHEESE.

Four star elements:

**** The local beer on tap they had...Dog Park Dark Amber.  not bad.  I'm quite the craft beer fan and had never heard of this beer.  

**** Menu, pastas.  Excellent menu diversity, intriguing specials, and an above average happy hour.  VERY temptingly priced lunch specials.  

**** Location.  Bell/Tatum, what's not to like?  Easy to tie a visit to Crust with your regular weekday evening errand routine to Walmart, Starbucks, Bank, whatever.  That intersection is very well stocked with consumery goodness. 

**** Rita's Frozen Custard joint next door, although they were completely out of frozen custard when we went (7/14/2015) due to a \"nationwide egg shortage\" and they had a sign warning potential customers of said shortage.  I've never been in a nationwide egg shortage before, and I admit I'm feeling the pinch since eggs suddenly do seem to be 2x their normal price across the city.  It must be HARD TIMES for breakfast places like US Egg and The Eggery.    

**** Bar seems well stocked.  Decent low and mid shelf stuff.  Drink menu not too bad in terms of specials and variety.  

Three star elements:

*** Decor and ambiance.  Yes, its in a strip mall.  But thats no reason to \"phone it in\" and use the same boring tables, chairs and wallpaper used in every other strip mall \"Italian-ish\" enterprise.  On the good side, our booth was very comfortable, but there are only two full size family booths in the place, so I imagine Booth Reservation Wars occurs during peak hours on weekends.  

*** They had like 4 beers on tap, including the god-awful Perroni which I suppose is added to lend some additional Italian panache.  Italian beers are like Yugoslavian cars.  They exist, but, well, yeah."}
{"text":"4/27/17.....a return trip to Crust after moving to the east valley.
We had a pizza rustica with meatball and a cheese calzone.
Both were absolutely delicious!!
The rustica pizza had great complex flavors with fresh basil and a great sauce. The Cheese calzone was also top shelf! We also watched numerous plates of delicious looking food served at a near by table. Whoever was cooking that saturday was killing it!! Monday-Friday happy hours look great with $5 food n wine.
We were at the bell rd / tatum location"}
{"text":"I went on there one year Anniversary and the food is very good. I would highly recommend there pizza or anything on the menu and the staff is very polite."}
{"text":"Besides having amazingly great food, there's always good service. I have never waited long here at all for anything. I always get the pizza with arugula topped with grilled shrimp and prosciutto. It is so good I just crave it sometimes. I compare it to alot of the top pizza places around and this is by far one of the best in my book beating out Bianco, Cibo, and Pomo. I've been searching for awhile and still am looking for one that will beat this one. As far as I'm concerned, right now it's the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  The food and service were great!  It was smaller than I expected, that might be a problem if you go at prime time with a large group."}
{"text":"I have never had better pizza in all of Phoenix!! I am from New York and this is as close as I can get (if not better) to pizza in NY. My friends and I have been regulars for two years and their quality has always been superb. We mostly go for the pizza because it truly has a unique taste that you won't find anywhere else, but once I ordered the meatball sub and wow! I was in heaven! There is nothing bad to say about this place I could go on for days about how their pizza is the BEST. And I know you won't disagree! They make their own homemade sauce too and you can buy it!"}
{"text":"We've tried a couple entrees one night and they were over sauced and bland. The only real highlight at this place is the garlic knots, very good. I've gotten the two slices lunch special two times. And each time I've gotten offered different things and different prices. It's supposed to be 5.95 for two slices and a drink. Last time I got toppings included and a huge cup for my drink. This time I had to pay extra(doesn't state anywhere that toppings are extra) and got a small cup and the kid couldn't even fill it up. Pizza is pretty run of the mill. Greasy and kind of bland but hey for a cheap quick lunch it works. The short dark haired female manager or owner not sure which was reprimanding an employee in front of the restaurant, apparently he was doing roll ups in the wrong area and she felt the need to let us all know. He was actually the best service I've gotten there. Shame she doesn't understand customer service or etiquette. I'll be back just because it's close to my house."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Pizza we have had in Phoenix!  This is a small cozy feeling restaurant with a great atmosphere.  We recently tried the house wine and it was excellent.  As a bonus their patio is dog friendly and we can bring one of our many dogs with us to enjoy dinner with!  I suggest you visit Crust soon!"}
{"text":"Service was good. The stars do not reflect the quality of service. The food on the other hand was not that great. It did not posses the flavor of what you would expect of a sit down type of pizza place. I am surpirsed since I have been to MyPie (their sister restaurant) and it is better pizza and food overall.

My qualms: Garlic knots, lack of garlic taste, the oil or butter was slopped all over this. It really was an excessive amount of oil/butter. The marinara sauce that came with it was bland, it didn't seem to be seasoned by much. The pizza was extremely greasy as well. The topings couldn't stay on the pizza when you picked it up because of the grease. The crust at the end was good, but underneath the pizza was soggy. Sad :(
The sauce used for the pizza was similar to the garlic knots sauce and left a lot to be desired.

The pictures of the pizza on yelp look amazing and completely different than my experience. Maybe it was an off night for them, but it definitely did not leave me saying, oh this is a place i want to come back to.

The mac and cheese was good. I could have done without bacon on it (but others at my table wanted it on). Maybe their other foods aside from pizza are good. You would assume, if a place is called crust their pizza would be good.


Its not that I don't like this place, I enjoy going to their sister shop, and would recommend that over coming here."}
{"text":"Yum. Almost perfection.

Intimate, cozy, relaxed atmosphere.

I started with the dirty martini which was very tasty and expertly mixed.

My husband, who is currently on a low carb diet, has a choice of a salad with chicken or the grilled chicken entree. He chose the Greek salad with chicken. He was craving carbs real bad so imagine the mixture of delight and sadness when his salad came in a huge bread bowl. He caved and had some of the bread bowl which I tasted. It was really good-  herbed and buttery. 

I had a small house salad and the eggplant rollatini. The salad was nothing extraordinary. Very basic. 

But the eggplant rollatini... OMG. Eyes rolling to the back of my head good. Perfect dough... crispy on the outside, brushed with butter and garlic. Filled with breaded eggplant that melted in my mouth. Lots of delicious cheese. And the marinara sauce it comes with may be my favorite marinara sauce in Phoenix. And that's a big deal. The serving size was huge. I could only finish half.

Service was good. Started out a bit slow, probably because they were very busy. But they caught up and were very attentive.

We will definitely be back... I am fantasizing about the rollatini right now as I type..."}
{"text":"Small but very nice.  I had a calzone ... very good ... would come back again!"}
{"text":"Great pizza-we had the meat rustica. 
Decent garlic knots and rigatoni pesto cream
Excellent tortellini Alla panna
So so on the Stromboli 

I like that there's a Rita's next door for a take out cold dessert to go home with your pizza.  

I saw a sign hanging advertising $10 take out pizzas on Sundays and Mondays which is a great deal."}
{"text":"Crust Pizza has become my favorite pizza!  I have had the Rusticas, the salads, the garlic knots, the meatballs, the wine and the beer and I have enjoyed everything there including the awesome customer service!  Keep it up Crust and I will be your devoted customer! ;)"}
{"text":"Love it. Their eggplant parm and garlic knots are my addiction and my husband loves the rusticas.  I love that they give loads of unbreaded eggplant in a pizza crust, it is very unique and so delicious. They are small and tend to get busy, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Crust is great!  Lots of vegetarian choices, and the pizza is really good.  My wife and I had the thin crust hand tossed pizza.  It's shaped like a bicycle seat - not your traditional pizza.  The sauce is peppery and sweet at the same time - really unique and tasty.  I was a bit bummed out by the beer selection which I was told were the basic Miller, Coors, Peroni and Moretti - which seems to be all the same weak lager.  Then another waiter told me to try the darker Moretti - it was great!  All served in an iced glass.  I wish the first guy would have known about that one when I asked if they had any darker beers.  

Decent TV's and a nice enough atmosphere.  I wish they had blinds or something to make me forget the fact that I was sitting on the corner of Tatum & Bell in a strip mall, but I can overlook that.  Very attentive and pleasant staff.  

We'll definitely go back and it's really close to our house also."}
{"text":"I ordered take out last night at this restaurant.  I have not ordered from them in about 2 years since we had moved away for a while.  I remember thinking that I would really miss their food.  We ordered take out for new years eve for my family and we have a little one, 4 years old, and the food was unbelievable!  I don't know how they do it but that pepperoni rollatini and garlic knots are incredible would suggest this place to anyone.  The food is always great.  

Thanks for making new years a little better and good luck in 2014!"}
{"text":"Crust is our go-to spot for a great date night. Love the Rustica pizza and chicken parmesan. The garlic knots are quite yummy too."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My family and I decided to celebrate my birthday at a pizza place and wanted to try this place.  We like to try new places.  We looked on yelp and saw good reviews, so we gave it a try!   
We ordered 2 pizzas, and waited more than 40minutes! Mind you, it was a Wednesday night and the place was nearly empty.  One of the pizzas had salami, which was the worst I ever had, the pizza was cold and no flavor.  After one bite I looked at my wife in disgust and she agreed! 

The waitress was really nice, service was okay.   She changed our pizza to a plain cheese pizza.  But by then our kids had fallen asleep and we were just annoyed.  I won't be back that's for sure!! What was supposed to be a special night, it was ruined.  

I don't recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Blech. I had a coupon in the mail for a free pizza rustico, so my husband and I tried this place one night. I ended up getting one of the thin crust pizzas, and it was awful. My husband got the baked ziti, and there was virtually no sauce on it, so it was very dry and bland. The service was also pretty poor. We did get the pizza rustico to go, however, and when I heated it up later was pretty pleased with it. But I think that might be the only good thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place! The service and food are awesome! It's a little place in a strip mall and fills up quickly on busy nights. Good wine selection and they usually have some type of deal somewhere (Val-Pak, Groupon, Local Dines).  I will keep going back and I normally do not go out for Italian because it's so easy for me to make at home. This kind of Italian is not something I could make at home."}
{"text":"I came back to Crust after a mixed experience. The pizza was delicious, the service and salad not so much. This time the pizza was just as good (maybe even better) than what I remembered and the service was friendlier. I ordered the NY round cheese pizza, and it is truly the best pizza I've had since I left the east coast. This combined with good customer service from the owner and employees warrants 5 stars this time around."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad service. Not ever going here again. The sign was out that said please wait to be seated. When the employee finally came out from the back, she offered us either of the two-tops that are right in the center and right under the very loud speaker. There were two open booths so we asked if we could sit at one. She said no, those are for three or more people. It's 7:30 on Friday night and you're going to save it for two different just-in-case  parties? So we left and went down to Venezia's where we sat in a booth, ate good pizza and salad and enjoyed excellent customer service. Not only did your employee cost you the sale for tonight, she also got you this lovely review, and we are never coming back, not to mention the word-of-mouth damage that could go on any time we are talking about where to go eat. It's just  a matter of time til you close the doors for good.  Better management could solve these kinds of employee problems."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood restaurant. We are surrounded by chains, this place just seems more personal:) great family friendly place with great happy hour pricing!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza! I really like their whole wheat crust as well.  It is a cute little place for a date. The wine is fantastic. The owners are really nice too."}
{"text":"Wow about sums it up! Found this restaurant off Yelp and it was not a disappointment! The food was absolutely amazing. There were 8 of us and there was not a bad meal. Every time something came out it got an ooo and aww from all of us in unison. From the Meat and Cheese platter to the calamari to the cheese knots, ravioli with lobster cream sauce to the manicotti, to the eggplant rolltini to the cheese cake to the cannoli....well you get the picture. It was all amazing!! And the service was 5 star! They were attentive and couldn't have been nicer. And finally Ian our waiter was wonderful! Made us feel welcome and like part of the family even though we were from California. All I have to say in closing is Ian and the restaurant has made #loyalcrustomer out of us!!!!! We will be back."}
{"text":"I went in for dinner tonight and was served by a young man named Justin. I will be honest and say that although the food was excellent, it was Justin's customer service skills that made my experience an enjoyable one. I find it rare these days that young people know how to interact with others but he was very polite, was honest on his personal favorite dishes. I even heard him interact with other customers and his high energy and positive attitude never changed, no matter who walked through the door. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I found the food and especially the service disappointing.  Arrived at Crust at 5:45 on a Tuesday, seated ourselves, and waited 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us or brought menus.  Another 10 minutes passed before the server returned to take our beverage order.  After placing our order, my salad arrived in timely fashion, but the glass of wine still had not arrived.  The server scurried to bring it, and it arrived in a glass that appeared dirty--spotted, sticky, with drops of food crusted on the outside.  The server was very courteous but constantly seemed overwhelmed by the large number of tables he was attending.

The spinach salad with fresh strawberries and mushrooms proved pretty tasty and generous in (enough for two people, though it was the small size).  The NY style pizza (which actually is a half pizza with 4 large slices, though the menu describes it as a 20 inch round) was okay, though the sauce was lacking in flavor, and the crust was soggy.  

I would not come here again--too many superior similar options, including Mellow Mushroom, Humble Pie, Amaro Pizza and Vino, and Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar."}
{"text":"What a great find close to my house  I just love the rustica pizza.  They even keep one half of the pizza in the oven to keep it warm as two normal sized people can't eat that much pizza. Plan on taking some home. @crust"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good price.  I love the sauteed vegetables.  They always have specials going on."}
{"text":"For casual neighborhood Italian, this place is great. Small enough to be intimate but clean and classy in its general style. The pizzas are tasty and right on for a quick or full meal. And yes.... just about everything on the menu is equally good - as is the service. Eating there or taking out, it's a great place when the urge strikes."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood Italian place. Everything was was \"pretty good\" though I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  But as a neighborhood place, I did like it. Some positives were great service, nice ambience with quiet Rat Pack music that didn't interfere with conversation, flavorful pizza sauce, and incredibly flavorful and juicy chicken in the Chicken Francese dish.  Negatives included that the Francese sauce was really watery with no viscosity at all, pasta was a bit shy of al dente, and their \"rustic pizza\" was a little hard to eat because all the toppings came off in one mouthful leaving the rest of the piece barren (as I write this I wonder if I should have gone with a fork and knife?).  

Overall, based on this one visit I would go back and try some other dishes. The service was really exceptional and they have some great happy hour options too."}
{"text":"I bought a coupon from LocalDines for Crust and after reading the reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I went with my bf and we started with the Caprese salad (full $7.95) It was good, but not your regular caprese salad, it was on a bed of lettuce and served in a bread bowl. Not that much caprese cheese tho :( and very thinly sliced. We ordered two of the rustico's since that is what they are known for. The Original Rustica - marinated tomatoes, fresh mozzarella & basil ($ 8; see picture) and The Palermo - fresh spinach, marinated tomatos, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella and EVOO ($8.50; see picture). They were both really good, thin crust so they are quite light for the size of them. The waitress informed us that we hadn't spent up to the $30 on our coupon (which was super nice of her) and offered 3 cannoli's to make it $30. SUPER good, this was my favorite part of the restaurant, fresh baked cannolis YUM! We would go back if we were in the area but nothing super super special -- i still like upper crust better :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  My Dh and I went there on friday night looking for decent pizza.  We arrived at 6:05pm and the server informed us that there was 25 minutes left of Happy Hour!  Woo Hoo.  Half price wine, beer, mixed drinks AND appetizers!  I ordered TWO glasses of wine and he let me get the HH price, which was cool.

We ordered the full pie - Grandpa's special which was sausage, peppers and onion perfection. We were surprised when the server brought out HALF a pizza.  We wondered if the economy troubles had now reduced pizza to half a pie, but not to worry.  The remaining half stayed piping hot in the kitchen! 

The pizza was huge and delicious. We ended up taking the other half home and the way they package it for you is nothing short of perfect. We just had the other half for dinner after 10 min on the pizza stone and I cant believe how good it was.

Service - perfect. Ambiance - OK. Full bar - SWEET. Pizza - fabulous!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new ownership and goes by the name, De Nora's. This restaurant is one of the unique venues where the horrible customer service outweighs the great-tasting food. I frequent this restaurant 1, maybe 2 times per week and every time there is something wrong. 

Tonight I called 25 minutes ahead of time and pre-ordered my usual, 1 large cheese pizza. After not being greeted for about 3-4 minutes when I arrived, the older gentleman at the front said \"Hello\" and went to search for my pizza. The new owner De Nora was there and she told me that the ticket did not print and they'd begin making it right now...not even a simple \"I'm sorry\". I told them I would wait, and then was presented by the owner with a tab for the full price. After questioning why I was paying full price for a meal that wasn't ready when I arrived, she took $5 off.

I will never go back to this restaurant again!! Absolutely a terrible customer service experience...every time."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  Rustica Pizzas are amazing!  Crispy, crunchy, fresh ingredients, yummm.. The Godmother Rustica is on our crave list!  The service is great and attentive.  They are very welcoming!"}
{"text":"While visiting family in Arizona, they recommended we pick up some food from Crust to eat while watching the game on TV.  Having a little trouble actually locating the restaurant using Google Maps, we finally found it nestled in the back corner of the shopping plaza.  YAY, time to eat!!  

We arrived to a very cozy pizzeria with limited staff.  However, that did not limit their ability to deliver exceptional service with speed and accuracy.  Having a family member with an actual gluten allergy, not just a hippie trying to be trendy, we were able to get a gluten free option for her to enjoy.  We ordered a pizza with mushrooms and all I have to say is NOM NOM!  The sauce had a light sweetness to it, probably from the type of tomatoes they use, and the crust was lightly salty; a great combination.  It was covered in mozzarella that was simply out of this world.  

Their prices were very reasonable, the restaurant was very clean, and they had a ton of great menu marketing on each table.  I always appreciate seeing a company invest in menu marketing at the tables, because that tells me they are very proud of their food selections to meet all types of consumers.  

Since we travel to Arizona quite a bit, we will certainly come back and most likely have a meal inside of their restaurant instead of doing takeout.  This meal left my mouth watering for more yummy food!"}
{"text":"I just moved and was looking for a pizza place to take my kids.  I found Crust and really enjoyed the pizza.  Finally a place outside of New York that calls the pizza a \"Pie\".   Great Pies...I will be back for more"}
{"text":"This is my favorite dine-in restaurant in Phoenix.  My favorite entree is the kale and chicken salad and Mozzarella Carozza appetizer.  My husband always gets the Chicken Francese. It's the best he's ever had. My kids love the homemade Rustica pizza. The crust is so light and crunchy.  The staff is so friendly and seem to take pride in their work. We love it there!"}
{"text":"I wish they gave 1/2 stars I would give this a solid 3.5 stars !!! First off I ordered on Sunday because they have a great special for take out right now it's only $10 for a \"20 in cheese pizza additional for toppings :) only available during football season I believe ? Well I ordered and it was prob one of the best pizza's I have had in a really long time crunchy crusts the perfect amount of cheese and sauce  . The staff that works in there is friendly it's always slow on Sunday nights it seems so if your not a big fan of crowds would make a great date nite out ? I haven't tried any of there other menu items but want to go there maybe for a girls nite out with some wine."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. We had the garlic knots, chicken Parmesan, the original personal pizza and Mac n cheese and EVERYTHING was spot on. Our waiter Justin was excellent. Great experience"}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic!  Prices are reasonable.  And they have great customer service.  The young woman that runs the show, keeps the entire staff on their toes and shows great attention to detail.  Improved location and this place is unstoppable."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. Had the mozzarella en carozza, chicken franchese and NY rustica.  All were absolutely delicious and we will be back! The marinara sauce on mozzarella was insanely good and the Rustica was best I've had outside the east coast"}
{"text":"Yummy place! Very inexpensive, great food & awesome service! The garlic knots are so so so good (and free on your first visit)! So glad this place is near our house! Will definitely be back when we are in the mood for Italian food. PS They have a dog friendly patio!!"}
{"text":"They've remained at the top of my pizza and casual Italian choices around. Still usually do their great Sunday/Monday take out deal. Quality and responsiveness, always."}
{"text":"Ordered a pie for pick up, they asked me for my first and last name over the phone..(my first name isn't that common)..I'm thinking why do they need my last name? I walk in to pick up the pie in a very small restaurant and my first and last name is verified (rather loudly), then they call to the back loudly once again) \"a pie pick up for my first and last name\"...then a guy walk out to hand me my pie stating  my first and last name all within earshot of the whole restaurant.  Call me paranoid but I don't need the whole restaurant to know my full name.  Then I get home with my 25 dollar pie and its cold and nasty.  The worst pizza sauce ever..seriously!!!! It tasted like dominos....I'm from NY and this was no grandma pie..not even the right shape...I threw it out after 1 slice..I don't think Ive ever had to throw out pizza before..I mean cmon how badly can you mess that up..its like messing up a fried egg...I've had pretty good pizza here in AZ thus far...which surprised me......Biancos very good...humble pie also good.  

This place puts my name out on blast and pizza taste like trash....yuk don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant by purchasing a deal-chicken for half off the meal. I would have never came into Crust without the deal; I had driven by it many times and had never even noticed it. They have a small outside patio, and an area inside with a bar. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

The food is great. I had the eggplant rollatini and have gotten it there ever since. I have tried bites of various other dishes (all which have been delicious), but the eggplant rollatini is by far the best.

I have recommended this place to friends and family and they have all enjoyed Crust just as much as I do. If you sign up for to receive their text messages they let you know about deals and happy hour specials. I am very happy that I found this restaurant after all the other deal-chicken fails. :]"}
{"text":"This was the best lunch I have ever had. We ordered this at 1100am and were able to pick up by 1120am! The food was fantastic! I got the Eggplant Rollatini, wasn't sure just what I would be getting, but it was A LOT better than I imagined. Eggplant, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella wrapped in  delicious dough! The pizza was to die for and the calazones were perfect. Great bang for your buck! I got 2 lunches from $8 and was satisfied both days."}
