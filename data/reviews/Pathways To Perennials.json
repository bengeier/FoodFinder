{"text":"Came here Easter weekend  Beautiful place. Food looks and tastes great. People are friendly. Dog friendly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Pathways to Perennials! I've been a returning customer for a number of years and have always been welcomed by the team in the retail store. They offer great everyday advice on products and plants and I've also attending a garden workshop (& cafe lunch). They do a great job with both their every day retail service as well as the special events and workshops that they host. I have yet to have left with a question unanswered or with a product that was not high quality. My gardens have come along way thanks to the Mennen family!"}
{"text":"I recently bought over $4,000 of plants at Pathways to Perennials.  When asked to pay this amount I requested an itemized bill of sale.  I was promised one when the plants would be delivered so I foolishly paid up.  Needless to say, no bill of sale was presented upon delivery and some plants that I bought were not delivered.  I also was charged for items that I had never agreed to buying in the first place.  I should have had better sense than to go along with such fraudulent business practices; I am writing this review in the hope that others will not be so gullible."}
