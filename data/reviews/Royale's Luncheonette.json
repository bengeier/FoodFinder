{"text":"Simple and straightforward delicious food.  Just went here for lunch after walking by this place many times.  I ordered the BLT and it was really fantastic. A lovely neighbourhood lunch joint with a good vibe."}
{"text":"Had a lovely brunch here. The luncheonette is inviting, cozy, and warm! It's a small space with an open kitchen, they were playing some great records when we visited.   We ordered the Royale (a cheeseburger), the candied beet salad, and the smoked salmon on multigrain. Everything tasted awesome.  The Royale: a cheeseburger with American sauce, comes with pickles.   Beet Salad: mixed greens, hazelnuts, beets and yogurt/goat cheese dressing. Light, but very nice.  Smoked Salmon: toasted with dill, cream cheese. Very great and light.   Would definitely return here for weekend lunch. Everything was fresh and tasty, service was great and the atmosphere was very inviting."}
{"text":"Beautiful little place with excellent food, great music and very nice staff! :) I can only recommend it.   Just make sure you bring cash because it is cash only."}
{"text":"After learning of a 45 minute wait at a nearby restaurant, we walked along Dundas until arriving at this small, unassuming eatery. The inside is essentially set up like someone's kitchen, with two communal tables and a completely open food-preparation area.  I decided to go with the BLT because who can say no to a delicious BLT? We sat at the table closest to the kitchen and tried desperately not to make eye contact with the people making our food. Our dishes arrived shortly after and I will admit the BLT was quite tasty. The shredded lettuce in there was a little questionable, but I enjoyed everything else about it. The bacon was fresh and crispy, and the proportion of other ingredients was perfect.  Not much else to say about Royale's Luncheonette; it's clear that the owners are looking to cultivate the atmosphere of a homey little eatery and on that level, they've clearly succeeded."}
{"text":"They do sandwiches and they do them exceptionally well. Hubby and I wanted veal parms so we ordered two. Watching the chef carefully grate parm over the two steaming sandwiches was like a seeing a still out of a food magazine. We enjoyed the little cup of pickled vegetables that came with each plate. The parms themselves were just perfect - tasty veal meatballs, outstanding tomato sauce, fresh and sharp bitter greens, airy and chewy bun, what seemed like some spicy mayo inside. 5/5 would devour again. Though I was wearing a suit and opted for dainty consumption with a knife and fork."}
