{"text":"You'd think that a really good burger wouldn't be that tough a feat to accomplish, but surprisingly not too many places seem to be able to pull it off. In 8 or so visits in the past few months Big Daddy's has consistently been able to serve up the best burgers I've had in Charlotte. Plus, they have really good fries, excellent sweet potato fries and the ne plus ultra of potato based burger sidekicks tater tots. I'm not certain why tater tots seem to go so perfectly with burgers, whether they actually taste good or it's more of a diabolicaly insidious after effect of school cafeteria tater-tot brainwashing, but the pairing of the tots and the beef puck works. If you dig root beer try the stuff they have on tap."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Bad Daddy's a couple times. Always a great atmosphere, great burgers and salads, and good service. Gotta try their Ghirardelli chocolate and peanut butter milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"Been here on multiple occasions and the food is pretty good. The burgers can be a little greasy and messy but they do have good flavor. I make my own salad and let me tell you it's great! I get a small and although it may look small it is plenty for me! The produce is always fresh and I add grilled chicken.....I would come back day in and day out for this this salad. Good atmosphere and service is always great!"}
{"text":"The burger practically melts in your mouth! Food and service are top notch. I will be back."}
{"text":"Good burgers but the parking is terrible and that normally forces us to ride on by. Atmosphere a bit pretentious. Ease up Dilworth, it's only burgers."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger and a beer.  The bison burger is my favorite for a leaner alternative to beef but I'm not crazy about the chicken sandwiches.  They also have great build your own salads with very fresh ingredients.  This place seems to always be packed so I would call ahead to see what the wait time is."}
{"text":"Driving to Florida stopped for a bite to eat... Awesome food and exceptional service .. Stopping on our way back"}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews I hope my experience was an isolated incident.  Also as many others pointed out the restaurant layout is horrible, tables way closer to each other and a very loud and obnoxious setting if you are seated anywhere near out of control children.  Our waitress was a-ok but in my book all of this is forgiven is the food delivers which sadly in my it did not.  I ordered a burger offered as an outside the menu item with a jalapeno bagel instead of the bun (big mistake what was I thinking in retrospect) and it was supposed to come with salsa.  The pattie itself was undercooked even though the waitress had prompted me not to order medium rare bc the quality of the beef they have no is not the same as it used too (I mean thanks for the tip lady but if I'm the mgr and hear that wow), anyway so I ordered medium, but got a pretty pink one anyway which any other day I'd actually would have enjoyed; however to me it seemed that this one was still frozen in the mid.  Again I hope this was an isolated incident, the rest of my party actually had enjoyed their food so I will be back for a 2nd try, this group has after all proven to be very successful here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Charlotte. And great sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"A little cramped, but we were seated quickly and the burgers were amazing! A little loud but overall enjoyed the food. service was quick too making it easy to stop in before our connecting flight."}
{"text":"Terrific food!  My husband had the burger, my son the salad topped with a burger and I had the nachos. Added an Elvis milkshake. Yum, yum!! Only negative: it was  freezing inside - turn the air down a bit!!"}
{"text":"Visited twice in the past month but never again. The burgers arrived frozen in the center and fries were cold and limp. The manager offered replacements but the second set of 3 arrived worse than the first, and fries never arrived. It used to be a favorite place for us, but as our friends said, the best thing to order at this burger place is chicken! It is a classic case of poor management and untrained staff."}
{"text":"It's a decent burger, they had some IPA on tap, and the service was good. I wouldn't wait longer than 5 minutes for this place, but if you can get in and get your order placed, don't hesitate to stop by."}
{"text":"What can I say? I've been going to mug night basically every week for going on a year now. From the basic to the specialty burgers to the evening specials, I've never been disappointed. It's a creative menu with delicious burgers (yes, even the turkey and black bean) and excellent sides. IF you still have room at the end of the meal, the milkshakes are very tasty, too. And just to top it off, they have a great tap selection.   The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is lively and the food outstanding. What more can you ask of a neighborhood joint that draws 'em in from all over town?"}
{"text":"Subpar at best.  I had breakfast here and the toast was bread thrown on the plate and they forgot the sausage with the eggs.  When I told someone about it - it was not corrected at it all seemed like a hassle.   A lot of people running around and the total time from sitting down through eating was over 40 minutes for eggs, sausage and toast.   At least I got the eggs and watered down oj ....  $16 later."}
{"text":"Okay, I am not a big burger guy but I love this place. My favorite is the \"Frenchie\" (turkey burger) but I've tried several of their hamburgers and they were all fantastic. You can choose fries (regular or sweet potato), tater tots, or a variety of other sides. They also have a great beer menu. If you're not in the mood for a hamburger they have a wide variety of other menu items, my wife especially likes the salads. They also have amazing milk shakes that are large enough to share. The service is friendly and fast. If you want a great burger in a fun atmosphere with plenty of TVs definitely go here. Five Guys and SmashBurger are both really good but Bad Daddy's beats both by far."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this place.  Friday and Sat are too busy. So we decided to try Sunday nite. No wait, yippie. !  I had the Mama ricotta Burger house made mozzarella, pesto tomatoes pepperoncini & extra virgin olive oil.  Great fresh tasty !  Hubby ordered the buffalo wings. delish also.  Next time I  will try the salads.  Good service and food."}
{"text":"If you love slaw and chili then order the Southern Burger.  It is out of this world!  Come with an appetite because the burgers are huge and their milkshakes are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"After all the hype about this place, I came there with high expectations. Boy I couldn't have been more disappointed.   Our server was nice enough and very attentive, but when that is the best part of the experience, it's not good. My girlfriend and I both order various forms of their Bacon Cheeseburger. I ordered mine to be cooked medium and it came out well done. My girlfriend ordered her burger medium well and it came out medium rare. I decided to just go ahead and eat my burger, while she decided to send it back and have it cooked longer.   The amount of grease that was dripping off both our burgers was too much for us. We both ended up eating almost half of our burgers out  of pure hunger more than anything else. I was really shocked at the quality of burger from a \"burger bar\". The fries were decent.   The restaurant itself has a pretty cool look to it, but it is very loud, almost like you are in a school cafeteria. I'm not quite sure where all the hype comes from for this place? It comes off as a desperate attempt to be the cool local burger joint that everyone thinks is cool to say they go there.   There are numerous places, not only on East blvd, but in the greater Charlotte area that I would recommend to get a burger.   Maybe it was just a one time bad experience, but like my rating says... \"eek! me thinks not.\""}
{"text":"Big Daddy's, the first place we take family or friends when they get into town. Whether we want apps or drinks, dinner, or just dessert, Big Daddy's always tastes fresh and the service is always awesome, I think because they're having so much fun and they love the food as much as the rest of Charlotte.   BD has quickly become one of our favorite go tos. From the nachos, to the amazing Mac and cheese appetizers, to the fresh salads with scatch made dressings, to our favorite the Sam I Am, a beef burger loaded with pesto, Rosemary ham, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, you can't go wrong. I recently decided to try a new burger and went with the frenchie on a whole wheat bun. It was a turkey burger with Brie, granny smith apples, applewood smoked bacon, garlic mayonnaise and it was awesome, but for me the part that made it so good was the waitress. She could see me trying figure if I wanted to try it, and because it happened to be one of her favorites, she stood behind it. \"No worries, if you don't like it, I'll get you your favorite.\"   They have a fully stocked bar, great beer options, and the best milkshakes, spiked or not.   Of course when you try a new restaurant you may want some help with the menu, at BD they always ask if you've been before, they want you to take your time and enjoy whatever you choose. It's a simple menu, but there are so many options, even the picky eaters can find something to make their own, due to the burger options alone: portabella cap, veggie, beef, turkey chicken, pork, and I even believe I'm forgetting one! Try it, you can't miss, but be prepared to wait a  a moment or two, because it doesn't matter the day or the time, Big Daddy's is always busy!"}
{"text":"This was the worst atmosphere and customer service I ever received from a manager at a restaurant. When the manager Luke decided to irately argue with me about false accusations me wanting free items from the bartender Liz when I paid having no problem or limit to what my money could buy on their menu. I felt so disrespect by Luke and if you choose to go to a restaurant in Charlotte and treated like human this is not the place to go!"}
{"text":"Lots and lots and lots of salt. The burgers are just like any cheap fast food but for a higher price. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the pittsburgher burger with fries. On the side was fried pickles and a bloody Mary!! Everything was delicious!! Definitely a place I'd want to stop by again on my next visit to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"The Bad Ass Burger lived up to its name. Good service, good prices, and a damn tasty burger. The only negative is the parking, but its worth it."}
{"text":"Outstanding burger ! Cooked medium rare and it was better than excepted!!! Fresh fruit as a side is a great option especially for a burger joint. My friend got a giant salad with grilled chicken which was cooked perfect.  Service was spot on. My server was very attentive to our needs and the manager also check on us and thanked us!  We will be back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"ALERT!! if anyone in your party has FOOD ALLERGIES you may want to reconsider eating here. I ate here with my daughters and grandchildren. My 3 year old grandson has a severe nut allergy and my daughter who is a great advocate for her son and his allergies asked 3 different times about the oil and the orders we placed and the waiter assured us there weren't any nuts in any of them and he was correct about that. My grandson was sitting next to his mother who had ordered a tuna burger with cole slaw again it does not contain nuts but  half way through her meal she noticed an actual whole nut on her plate. We proceeded to call the manager over and I explained to him on a scale from 1 to 10 my grandsons nut allergy is a 10 if he had that nut on his plate and ate it it could have been fatal to him. The manager said he was sorry and it must have come from someone's salad plate and offered us a new Tuna burger which we declined. The manager was nice but it was quite obvious he did not grasp the seriousness of this mistake. He did not appear to be overly concerned. He did  not offer us any further compensation in any way and most disturbing he never came back to the table again to make sure the rest of the meal was uneventful or to assure us he will speak with his staff to make sure they understood the greatness of this mistake to ensure it never happened again to another customer. I can only assume the manager never followed through because he does not understand the severity of the mistake. It seems ridiculous that in this era he is running a family restaurant which has many children as customers and he may not be knowledgeable to the fact there is an epidemic of food allergies especially Nuts. There is more to running a good business than smiling and being courteous. If you decide to still eat here and have food allergies be very careful. I am hoping by writing this review the manager may now understand the seriousness of this error and educate himself and his staff on the importance of being very diligent when preparing customers meals."}
{"text":"Very good Greek salad and chicken tortilla soup.  Much better option than chilli's and other airport restaurants.  I will eat here again."}
{"text":"After only two trips this place has won my first five star review as a yelper.    My first trip I was trying to keep it healthy and I built my own salad with a perfectly cooked Buffalo burger on top.  This was a first for me and I highly recomend it for anyone out their who knows they should order a burger(you are at a freakin burger bar) but you just cannot afford the carbs.  My second trip I gave in and ordered the Mama Ricotta's burger cooked medium on wheat(highly touted by my roommate).  This burger comes with fresh mottzerella, tomato, and housemade pesto   and is quite possibly the best burger I have ever had.  I also had the special side of the day which was their Mac-n-cheese with a spoonful of chilli on top.  I was only able to eat three bites of the side but I knew it was something I could enjoy later.  If you want the best and greasiest buger you have ever had, it can be found here!"}
{"text":"Went with the family here on Saturday night.  The place was busy, and after being told that we would have a 30 minute wait, our pager lit up 10 minutes after we got it.  Our server was great in letting us know about the special beers and food that was available.  I ordered one of the special beers, and it was quite good.   She came by later to ask what I thought about it.  We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, and I have to say, I was very disappointed.  I am a fan of fried pickles, but these were way too salty for us, and we were only able to have about half of the order before we gave up.  One reason why I like Bad Daddy's is that they have a buffalo burger.  I am a huge fan of buffalo, and to me, it has a better taste than beef and is overall better for you.  My oldest had the same burger, and loved it.  It really is served well.  I also liked how the sides are served in small bowls, separate from the rest of the meal.    I got their home made potato chips, and they are very good!  Very crispy.  I have had other home made chips at other restaurants, but they usually end up soggy and all bunched together.  Our server did keep tabs on us, and got refills on our drinks.  Well, except for my request for another beer on special.  Either she did not hear it or just forgot.  Regardless, the food was good (except for the fried pickles), the service was overall good, and the restaurant is loud.  Not a place to have a nice, quiet dinner.  We will go back, but there are so many other restaurants to try in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a refreshing addition to the CLT airport cuisine. Burgers fresh and cooked to perfection and ice cold beer. Nice."}
{"text":"The Bad Ass Burger is one of boldest burgers I have ever eaten. Two 5 ounce ground beef & bacon patties with lettuce, tomato, buttermilk fried bacon, horseradish mayo and English cheddar cheese. Everything about this burger is over the top... double cheese, double bacon, and double beef. Burgers that are trying to be intimidating have a reputation for being merely average. However, the Bad Ass Burger lives up to its name and packs a load of flavor. Juicy beef, crispy + flavorful bacon, creamy cheese, and flavorful sauce make this burger a treat for the taste buds. Despite being a monster burger it was reasonable to handle and I did not feel \"too full\" after finishing it. Bad Daddy's might just have the best burgers in Charlotte."}
{"text":"After looking for some new and interesting local eateries, we came across Bad Daddy's. After a little research on Yelp we couldn't help but try this gem.   We ordered the Bacon Burger on Steroids and it did not disappoint. It was amazingly good and deliciously messy. I'm fairly certain I'm in a bacon coma as I type. We coupled this with the tater tots and another great choice.   We chased this down with some local brews and we were stuffed which is a bummer because they were sporting a Peach Cobbler Milk Shake which, while tempting, we just had no room left!   Definitely recommend and we'll return!"}
{"text":"Being from Charlotte originally, I always look forward to getting great food when I am back.  I love the other Bad Daddy's locations (Dilworth and Huntersville).  I was excited about the airport location for those visits to Charlotte when I just don't have time to go to one of the other locations.  However, this location is not anywhere near as good.    I knew as I placed my take-out order that it would require a wait time of about 15-20 minutes...which is fair enough to wait for a good burger.  I ordered the southern burger as chili on the burger is something I can't find in Cayman.  After waiting the 15-20 minutes and then getting to the gate, I was largely disappointed to find that they had given me a burger with only cheese and mustard.  I rushed back to the take-out to let them know that it was missing the chili.  The girl working the take-out counter did not seem to care much about customer service. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude and didn't listen well when I was telling her the problem so it took a few minutes for her to address it.  She was able to give me a little cup of chili to go to add to my burger.    I had ordered the burger medium and it came out well-done.  Although the burger still tasted excellent, it was not the high quality of the other locations. Bojangles in the airport is much better than this."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger person but I can appreciate a good burger as much as the next person. This burger is heaven and I'm not overstating by any means. It is absolutely amazing! Onion straws and mozzarella cheese- delicious on a burger, much to my surprise!  Don't forget to dip your burger in the bad daddy's sauce... who am I kidding, dip everything in it!  It is fabulous and it tastes good on everything! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Big Daddy's has been very tasty both times I have been there.  The food is well-prepared and delicious, the service is good and they have a competent drink selection.  Also, there is outside seating which is really very nice.  I love that you are given the option to create your own burger.  I enjoyed pineapple on my burger both times.  Additionally, their sweet potato fries are great.  The only drawback is that there can be a fairly substantial wait.  I wish that there were more seating so that I could enjoy a burger sooner.  They did have cornhole outside to play while you were waiting, though, which was nice."}
{"text":"i had the bad ass burger and sweet potato fries both were very tasty."}
{"text":"I had the Southern Burger and it was fantastic.  The service was so-so, I was never asked how my food was and my beer was empty a d not asked for another until I made the check sign.  I will definitely eat her again though, that was one heck of a burger."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! Got the Sam I Am and it was delicious. Never thought pesto on a burger would be as good as it was. Couple people in our group got the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids and also loved it. Place was crowded and noisy but the food was well worth the wait. Definitely recommend if you're looking for both delicious and creative burgers in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday and other than the fact that you can't order a Bloody Mary before noon, everything was great.   The Banh Mi burger was amazing and I already know I'll find myself craving this tasty burger soon. The Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids was a heart attack on a plate, yes, but so, so good! The sweet potato fries rock!   The best part is that we had excellent service on top of a great meal. Our waitress was nice and attentive. When we explained to her that we recently moved to North Carolina, hints why we didn't know that you can't order a cocktail to accompany your early lunch on the Lord's day, she welcomed us and told the manager who promptly came to our table to greet us. The manager sent us a complimentary banana pudding which was incredible (order the banana pudding!!!) and sealed the deal...we'll be back!! After 12:00 pm of course.   UPDATE: Not going to remove a star, but the second visit was not quite as nice. We went to Big Daddy's on Friday night with out of town guests and the food was very good, but this time the service was not so good. Our waitress was actually very nice, but the very same manager who so kindly welcomed us and gave us free banana pudding last time was quite rude.   I received a coupon by email after signing up for Big Daddy's \"email club\" or whatever it is, which was the recommendation of said manager at the last visit. When I asked if it is possible to use the coupon by showing the email on my phone, the manager came over and gave me a full lecture about how I need to print the coupon and rudely implied that I would try to use the coupon again to screw him out of a $4 appetizer. Seriously?? I am not 16 and claiming its my birthday to get a free dessert! I simply asked if it was possible to be \"green\" and use the electronic version of the coupon. It would have been much easier to just say no. I can do without the lecture. So that was an awkward end to what was supposed to be a nice evening with our guests.   Moral of the story: great food, angry manager, so please print your coupon and hope they recycle."}
{"text":"Someone told me I had to try Bad Daddy's and I was skeptical because I am picky about hamburgers. I went to the Birkdale location and found the hamburgers to be excellent and big!!! Definitely one of the best burgers I have had, and I'll be going back when I am in that area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. This is my first post ever. I felt compelled to tell people to stay away. Took 10 plus min to get a water. Asked for hot tea. Took two tries to bring a bag and hot water to me. Thank goodness I don't like any honey or lemon in my tea. My breakfast was cold but I could not get the waitress's attention to tell them so I ate a few bites cold. I finally saw her when she threw the bill at us and took off. I've never stiffed a waitress before but this time it was the principle of the matter!! By the way there were only 5 others in the restaurant and about 5 waitress. So not exactly packed."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary isn't great and costs $15. Save your money!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can we say big daddy's sauce is da bomb! A vegetarian is saying this mind you. Fried pickles are the kosher pickle kind with the crispy breading with addictive non valley's ranch ranch dip YUM! All of a sudden the queen of will power is bumming tater tots off her co-workers plates. Not a coincidence my friends the food is worth the wait in line at lunch. Not to mention a tater tot dip in big daddy's sauce. Seriously love the place. Sometimes I hate the sub-par service but I will keep going back for more. It is hard to get burger fans and vegetarians to agree on a place for lunch. This place is it. On a side note for those meat eaters the meat is hormone free and grass fed burgers. Hooray!"}
{"text":"Terrible. We ordered 2 Bloody Mary's, they used so much Tabasco I couldn't drink mine, I love heat and spice, horseradish, etc, but this was awful. Then ordered a classic burger medium rare. Got a well done patty on a bun, with nothing else, had to ask for lettuce, tomato, etc. By the time it came burger was cold. The bill for those three items was $47!!! Just don't!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! Be forewarned that if you are my lunch date and order a salad, I will give you grief because it's not called Bad Daddy's Salad Bar (I'm sure the salads are good, but I'm not one to cheat on my beloved burger). The Frenchie (as a turkey burger) with melted Brie, bacon and apple has been my favorite burger for years. Add a side of tater tots and a tall frothy root beer from the tap and I am one tres happy gal."}
{"text":"A Midwest transplant, I like to think I know a juicy, high quality burger when it hits my plate. If you're looking for a run of the mill fastfood, double patty burger or a calorie conscious meal, you may stop reading now. Bad Daddy's Burgers is gourmet without being pretentious, the overly generous portions you expect from the south with the deep fried deliciousness that accompanies your soon to be clogged arteries.   This review deserves special recognition because it was officially my first meal as a full-fledged Charlottean. Bad Daddy's kicked off my foodie game and set the bar high.   On my inaugural trip, I was recommended to try the fried pickles as a starter. Keep in mind, these bad boys aren't common up north (read: they don't exist), and I've been known to be mocked by my \"friends\" for drinking pickle juice while inebriated (I hear it cures hangovers?). If I didn't love pickles before, I sure do love them now that they're deep fried. They're just the right amount of tart and sour balanced with the batter that brings back childhood memories at the fair.   I ordered the Bad Ass Burger, because the name sounded cool and also because I couldn't focus on anything else after I read the words, \"buttermilk fried bacon.\" Whoever came up with it, I salute your sheer genius. Biting into that burger is heaven...words can hardly describe how perfect the combination of medium rare meat, bacon with a crunchy fried covering, and horseradish mayo is. Bad. Ass.   Side note: I like to imagine I resembled one of the Carl's Jr commercial models devouring the burger, but that's far from reality. In reality, I ate that burger like there was no tomorrow.  It was just that good."}
{"text":"I really don't do any reviews, but for Bad Daddy's Burger Bar I'm making an exception....The Burgers are so DA#N good as well as the Parmesan Fries....Pricey for a burger, but you sure do get every penny of the $12.95 Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids...It's a huge burger....Oh...by the way...the onion straws w/chipotle ranch are the Bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Loud environment so its great for kids.   Its a little small for large groups but we have never had an issue with seating 10 or so with a short wait. Parking can be tough in all of Birkdale but that's not an issue they can resolve.   The buffalo chicken sandwich is amazing."}
{"text":"Decent food, great location, and great service.  We chose this place because it looked pretty good for airport food, seemed to represent local Charlotte, and was convenient to our gate. As a vegetarian, I was excited to see that they had a black bean burger.  We Ordered: a mama's ricotta burger and the cantina 1511 burger (comes as a black bean burger). Unfortunately after ordering, we found out that they ran out of the black bean burger. Our server was very accommodating and I ended up with a tree hugger's salad (extra feta) and a side of tater tots (which I highly recommend with garlic mayo).   In the end, the server turned an experience that could have soured our 3 HR layover into a highlight of the evening. We would order both of our dishes again."}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint! Tater tots are awesome too.   Affordable prices and great location in the heart of Birkdale."}
{"text":"Food was good, outdoor patio was clean. I got a burger (can't remember the name) with Brie and grilled apple on it which was really good.   Our food took a long time to come out, but our server was friendly.   I'll likely return, but I'm not in a hurry to."}
{"text":"Maybe I didn't order the right things, but the crispy buffalo wings were terrible. They were super small and over cooked... I guess that's why it's crispy? Also the fried pickles were so salty, it was good if you just had one. Then the sweet tea... I guess it was a south thing, but it was the most sugar filled drink and after a sip I asked for the unsweetened.  My husband ordered a burger with BBQ and tots. Burger was well done after he asked for it medium, but for me it was good. It came with fries when he asked for tots and 10 mins the tots came and they were over cooked. It tasted like a ball of grease. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"For an airport eatery this is above par, hense the 4 stars. Decent medium well cooked burger with slaw.   Would be a 3 star outside of an airport though."}
{"text":"I've been to Charlotte a few times now and have been here each time. Always a great burger whatever you get! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the fries are just ok. I end up just eating the whole burger and passing on the side."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a burger and fries.  I prefer the buffalo burger on wheat -- even though I'm eating a calorie-infested meal, it makes me feel a tad bit healthier!  The grease is the reason I don't give this place a five-star review.  The amount of grease on the fried pickles was border-line disgusting - a literal pool of oil is found in the basket it's served in.  Every burger I've ever ordered from here seems to completely saturate the bottom half of the burger bun.  I usually grab a bunch of paper towels (which are found on the table) and towel my food down before I start eating to avoid a giant oily mess.  Wednesday night is a great night to come in -- they have a special where you bring in your own glass (of any size) and they will fill it for a flat rate.  12oz glass?  $3.  60oz glass? $3.  Bring a DD!"}
{"text":"Just finished gulping down a bacon burger on steroids and fries. Bad Daddy's sauce was excellent along with the burger. Had to ask how to eat it because I wasn't sure how I was supposed to take a bite out of such a big burger. Fries aren't special but the burger and sauce made it special. Tiana was very friendly and quick and made the experience even better. Good food and good service. I can't think of a reason to knock off any stars."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in Bad Daddy's recently. I've gone to this restaurant a number of times and have great experiences. Unfortunately, I learned to never go on the weekends.  I showed up on a rainy, dreary Sunday with nothing but brunch on my mind. I walked in at 12 ready to go. Unfortunately, I learned that their brunch menu stops at 11am on Sundays (what?). Very confusing since most brunch menus run until 1 or 2 around this area.   Since we were there and it was raining, we decided to stay. We were told there would be a 20 minute wait for a table. It took 45 minutes to get a table. No worries, we were in no rush and thought it was just a bad day for the staff.  We sat down and ordered appetizers which came out right away. We ordered our food and it took about 45 minutes before it ever came out. I was totally frustrated because we weren't even acknowledged during that time. And we certainly didn't have a drinks refilled. Plus, our food was not cooked to order. We didn't return it because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for a new order.   After we were finished we ordered dessert. We waited....and waited....and waited. 30 minutes later we got our 2 milkshakes. Then, we waited....and waited....and waited for our check. All in all, we walked into the restaurant at 12 and we left at about 3:30. When we left, we saw half the staff smoking behind the building. Maybe that's where everyone was while we were waiting so patiently!  If you want a relaxing brunch experience on a Sunday---go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The \"hostess\" did not say a word to me....She is clearly MISERABLE!!! Waiter was nice though."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, and the service was outstanding.  My server was able to explain the beers and the food specials without sounding boring and rehearsed.  She was awesome."}
{"text":"This is NOT health food but it is DELICIOUS food. I really enjoyed our dinner. We went on a Monday night and the place wasn't busy. We were seated immediately and I had a chicken burger and my husband had a hamburger. The portions are huge. We also split onion straws and an oreo milkshake. I wish the onion straws were a little bigger, so they would be easier to eat but the coating was fantastic and it didn't fall off the onions like some onion straws. Everything was yummy and we had a very relaxing, calm dinner which is exactly what we were looking for.  When we're in the mood for burgers again, we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was rumored around town to have the best burgers in Ballantyne and does not disappoint.   I had the Bad Daddy burger, the burger patty was delicious but the bacon that came with is was floured and fried, not my forte. Burger was also overly greasy but still, very delicious.  For my side I had the sweet potato fries which were out of this world, by far the best sweet potato fries I've had in this area."}
{"text":"When I go out to eat I seldom would get a burger BUT if I come to Bad Daddy's Burger you besta believe that's what I'm getting.  All I can say is that they know how to make a really good burger and an AWESOME mudslide.  They really do have the best mudslide.  Since I don't get a lot of toppings on my burger I always opt to build/make my own and end up saving a few bucks.  Every time I go I also like to get the homemade potato chips with their pimento cheese sauce.  The sauce has a nice kick to it.  Overall:  great burger, great service and AWESOME mudslide."}
{"text":"Good food.  Super slow inattentive service. Could be 4 stars easy, but really bad service."}
{"text":"now, i know this review may irritate die-hard big daddy's enthusiasts (of which i have encountered quite a few), but please bear with me.  i do like this place.  honestly.  the venue is a nightmare.  tiny, packed, loud, etc.  i try to come here when i have more than five people with me so that we can properly combat the noise with ruckus of our own.  i find myself deliberately trying to be obnoxious so that i can leave an impression, which isn't necessarily a good thing - fighting with screaming infants never is.  service can be a crapshoot.  i've had excellent servers, and i've had ones show me this is their temp job . . . and it'll be over very soon.  the food does a good job of combating the aforementioned issues - a great selection at a very fair price.  i'm partial to creating my own burger or building my own salad.  if i had to choose something i loved on the menu, i'd most likely go with the buffalo chicken sandwich.  this food is very, very greasy.  in fact, stay far away from the onion rings if you don't want to catch yourself \"ringing\" your hands in shame hours later.  the fat content is not justified by the taste.  if you want something deep-fried that is worth the calories, go for the sweet potato fries.  i'm not usually a big fan, but these are delicious.  being partial to shoestring frites, i find their chunky steak-cut fries so-so, and their tater tots nothing special.  all in all, i find myself getting take-out from big daddy's more often than not because the food/selection is really great for the money.  if i want to eat at the actual restaurant, i'm in a gambling, cantankerous mood, and i don't know if this is conducive to being positive.  yes, i do know there is another (roomier) one in ballantyne.  why the eff would i drive there if the original is five minutes away from me?  i really do like this place . . . but sorry if the truth hurts, die-hards."}
{"text":"It was a good experience and the place has very good vibes the service here is good nd the taste of burgers are very good would love to visit again."}
{"text":"There comes a time in every man's life where he must make a choice.  Ideally, that choice is not between a colonoscopy or a root canal.  Such an impasse is one which I reached upon my arrival at the Charlotte Douglas Airport Bad Daddy's Burger Bar.  Having heard nothing but glowing recommendations from friends and family, I was enthused upon discovering a location just by my gate.      Sadly, not only did a 15 minute takeout wait stretch to 35 minutes, I was forced to become the needy customer I loathe in my years of restaurant experience or miss my flight.  I chose the former. I nearly hopped into the kitchen myself to get a lackluster Western burger.  The staff seemed apathetic to the situation, but graciously gave me the wrong dressing, cheese, and a cold side.    I must applaud them on the worst burger experience in my almost three decades of pumping sweet red meat into my body."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries.   The fried pickles are to die for.  The onion string with the sauce is awesome!!"}
{"text":"What a delight! I'm a burger expert. I've eaten every burger on earth. Best one here. Oh boy!"}
{"text":"Love loved loved the burger that I had at Big Daddy's Burger Bar. Tried on a busy Friday night and had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, but it is a popular place with a lot of energy. Our server was great, gave us his suggestions, and then let us look over the pretty expansive menu. There are so many great choices! When we got our food everything tasted spot on and was totally delicious! One of the best burgers that I've ever had with a great homemade fresh taste. I also love is that they use hormone free beef to make their patties; this really puts my mind at ease when eating red meat and so few places have an emphasis on such high quality ingredients. Obviously, I would love to see more local and organic items as well, but I'm huge fan as is! My husband and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, they were quite busy.  I was overcharged for my meal but could not make my case because my flight was 15 min from takeoff.  I ordered steroid burger 13.99 and sweet tea $ unknown.  However my bill was 21.18.  I brought it to hostess attention but that is all I could do.  I will never eat here again and will have to think again now before telling waitress I am in hurry."}
{"text":"The best burger in town!!!!! I love a good burger and this place takes the cake!!!! Juicy, seasoned and cooked to perfection. The sweet potatoes fries are yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse than the extremely overpriced food ($7 for a small chocolate shake...seriously) is the sheer rudeness of the wait staff.  Save yourself the trouble and eat elsewhere.  This place SUCKS."}
{"text":"Good burgers, we like ours cooked medium rare, they were happy to do so, when we did get them they sewer a little over cooked, but not behemoth to send back.  Or server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  An OK selection of beer with loyal brews on tap."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I live in NJ and I would make the 10 hour drive to eat the burgers here. Fries and sauce were also amazing. Whatever you get, get garlic mayo on it. Amazing. Great HD tv's everywhere playing sports with the Beatles on the speakers. Great service. Great great great great. Oh and the crispy onions, great."}
{"text":"I am a fan. My favorite burger joint. Bison burger is the must.. Their salads also very good. Casual atmosphere with good rock music. I feel relaxed there. It just kind of a modern dive in place for me. Friendly staff, good service."}
{"text":"I had the BD All american burger. I was a good burger but the bun did not hold up. Not even half way through and the bottom bun was soggy and almost non existent. We went on a friday night but the service was still really slow.   25-30 for a medium rare burger."}
{"text":"Not only is their food consistently amazing, their level of customer service even on a busy day is truly enjoyable. I called ahead to make sure it was ok for me to bring my puppy. The bartender on the phone told me it shouldn't be a problem. When I got there, I spoke with the manager and she had no problem with me bringing her in. The host even offered to bring her water for me.   We love this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely amazing burger like you want it..and great service....try the pimento cheese dip and home made chips.."}
{"text":"I went to Bad Daddy's today for the first time and had a great experience. The burger was good, definitely better than many I've had. I'd go back to the restaurant for the burgers alone, but what made the experience great was the milkshake. I had a spiked cookies 'n cream milkshake and it was the best milkshake I've ever had. Seriously, go try it right now. It's amazing.   Only con was the parking. I went on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30 so that might be a super busy time, but it took a while to find a place to park. Other than that, no complaints at all. Go check the place out!"}
{"text":"The food at this location is always great. You can customize your burgers/sandwiches and salads, so everyone should be able to find something that they like. Service is hit or miss, but the food more than makes up for any lapses in service."}
{"text":"I was told by many people this was the place to go in the Ballantyne area for a great burger.  Boy do I love burgers!  We went there at a pretty off time, Sunday night around 8 or so.  There was no wait, and the restaurant was barely half full.  But I could easily see how this place could get very busy.    The server was good, fast, efficient.  The decor of the restaurant is great and fits what you would expect a burger place to be like.    I ordered the Classic Southern Burger which is a burger topped with Chili, coleslaw, lettuce, and pickle.  I also got the sweet potato fries.  My fellow diner got the basic burger and added bacon, and cheese, along with a Guinness from their very expansive drinks menu.    As far as the quality of food we can't complain.  The burgers were very tasty and the fries weren't soggy or cold.  The only problem I have is with prices.  Beer prices are actually very reasonable.  But, my Southern Burger was 8.00.  Which is somewhat reasonable for a good burger and some fries. My girlfriend added Bacon and cheese to hers and it was 9.50.  9.50 for a burger with bacon and cheese is just kind of pushing it.  The Burgers were good, but I can't say that it tasted twice as good as a Five Guy's burger, or 25% better than a Chili's Burger.    But as you read the menu, you get the feeling that you're paying more for the fact that the menu is well prepared and the meat is bought from the right places.  And that is something I can appreciate.    We will be back, but maybe not as often as we would have been if the burgers were just psychologically a little bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Lots of burger choices.  The Cole slaw is exceptional.  The tater tots and sauce is incredible."}
{"text":"Found a nice spot at the end of the bar. Perfect since I was alone. Ordered a Bloody Mary which was very good. The male bartender was very attentive. Here comes a waitress/bartender and asked me to move to the other side of the bar between 2 very large men. Apparently the couple sitting along the window in what the waitress said \"uncomfortable seats\" since they were metal wanted move up to the bar. I made the move paid my tab and left. She really made me uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"Went her with my brother on a Wednesday night to grab a bite.  My brother told me this place was good.  I was a little skeptical as usual.  I had the Frenchie turkey burger and I must say I was impressed.  If your hungry you will definitely get full.  I had my burger with sweet potato fries(awesome fries).  My food was hot and delicious.  The staff was friendly and the manager checked on us.  I always appreciate it when management checks on you even if it is busy.    I had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back.   There are several other burgers I want to try."}
{"text":"We've been going to Big Daddy's since it first opened and it used to be our \"regular\" spot up until about 4-5 months ago.  The food has just gotten too inconsistent.  I agree, when you go and the food is cooked to order it is fantastic.  One of the best burgers around.  But of the last three times I have been, two of those times my burger was way overdone, almost charred on the outside.  When I'm in the mood for a burger, I want it to be cooked exactly like I ordered.  We also used to love Big Daddy's for its salads.  They were fresh, with great flavor and presentation.  In my opinion, the salads in general have gone downhill.  The lettuce and some of the vegetables are watery, there's not a lot of flavor at all and it just looks and tastes bland.  Not to mention that their balsamic dressing in particular continually changes from week to the next.  It was sooo much better in its original form.  Every time they try to change it it gets less and less flavorful.  So it's the inconsistency from one visit to the next that gives them only three stars.  Still a great atmosphere and sometimes our meal is fantastic, but too many times I walk out thinking that it just wasn't that great and not wanting to go back for a while.  So this unfortunately isn't our \"go to\" spot like it used to be, but I'm hopeful that the place will turn back around into what they were when they first opened."}
{"text":"Love this place! We ordered banana pudding (first:-) and it was awesome. The build your own salad is the best in the city. Our waiter Bobby couldn't be better, friendly funny and attentive. This is definitely a must eat place in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"Went with my son..whom is a burger connoisseur like me. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids, medium well. It was cooked perfectly. The jalapeno bacon gave it a little bite but not so much that it overpowered the rest of the sandwich. My son ordered the Pittsburgher and he thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  This is a must visit place for out-of-towners. Excellent burgers, great wait staff, good ambiance."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is the place to be! The variety on the menu is fantastic and you can absolutely find something that you want. My problem was that I wanted the whole menu.   I have been to bad daddy's a few times and their chicken nachos are ridiculously great! They give you a very large portion and you don't want to stop eating them! Their black bean burger is also top-notch.  Last night I ate a turkey burger with black bean toppings on a multi-grain bun. Phenomenal! Also a great size!  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her margarita and she created her own salad. Boy-oh-boy that salad was delicious! (Of course I had to try).  We had really good service and I appreciated everything about the place (...except the parking as someone has mentioned). Thanks BD's!"}
{"text":"Hard not to give 5 stars when it's the best burger I've ever had. I went with the Pittsburgher (just moved to Charlotte from Pittsburgh) and added fresh jalapeños. Cooked to a perfect medium and so juicy. You would be a fool not to check this place out if you're in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love the food service is subpar. Our waitress was strange at best. She put her arm around my husband and when she was delayed coming over to us she said she had been in the restroom and took longer then expected! Say what? Over share! I love the food and we will continue with takeout but dine in we will pass sorry guys! Please beef up the staff I have had nicer service at a fast food place."}
{"text":"EMPLOYEES GO AWOL AND LEAVE CUSTOMERS HANGING. 40 MINUTE WAIT FOR A BURGER.   Employees were coming in and out of side door to talk with their friends. They were having great time while customers were waiting. They got the order messed up and then had to wAit 40 minutes for a to go burger. Management please do something!"}
{"text":"Have to say this used to be my favorite place for a burger, but ate there yesterday and the food has gone down hill big time.  Not sure why or what happened, but not going back.  BIG disappointment.  I always get the same thing (Mama Ricotta burger), so it wasn't that I was trying something different. It didn't feel clean there either."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places! their cantina bean burger is amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Postmates so I haven't been to the restaurant but my burger and tots were great. They ran a deal through Postmates which I thought was pretty generous and wise of them. We will definitely visit the restaurant this summer."}
{"text":"The Good:  the food.  The burgers here are amazing.  I know that Charlotte is being overrun with gourmet burger bars and the only thing outnumbering these are churches and condos with no buyers, but Big Daddy's was one of the first to bring this town outside-the-box burgers.  My favorites?  Sam I Am (grass-fed beef burger with fried egg, pesto and rosemary ham), The Frenchie (turkey burger, brie, apples, applewood smoked bacon and garlic mayo) and the Cantina 1511 (black bean burger, green chilies, cheddar, monterey jack, avocado and chipotle ranch).  The tater tots are crispy (albeit greasy, but it's a burger joint, for crissakes!), the sweet potato fries delicious and at one point they served fries that were fried in duck fat--the nectar of the gods--on the weekends.    The Bad:  you need a Doppler radar to forecast when you might be able to find a seat here.  I guess that the crowd proves that the food is really, really good, though.    The Ugly:  how you feel after you eat a burger and tater tots."}
{"text":"Company meeting at Bad Daddy's!  Great burgers!  Biggest burgers I've ever seen!  Yum!"}
{"text":"The Ahi Tuna burger was unique and outstanding.  My wife enjoyed the Italian burger.    We all loved the sweet potato fries.  My friend tried the Bad A$$ burger and it was too big for her to handle."}
{"text":"Great burger, tater tots and beer. Wife had chicken sandwich and could barely get it in her mouth. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Didn't have much time.  Ordered the Greek salad.   They said 20m but it came in less then 10m. it was fantastic and loaded.   Good atmosphere for an airport."}
{"text":"I had \"build your own omelet\" breakfast special to-go. The food was good. The only issue I had was the food buzz to alert me never went off. Lucky, I went to check and it was sitting on the counter. :\"}
{"text":"You should never review a restaurant you've only been to once.  That said I went to Big Daddy's soon after they opened in 2007.  I wasn't that impressed at the time.  The service was terrible, they were out of most of their offerings, and I felt it was overpriced.  These things are expected when a new restaurant opens.  It takes some time to work out the kinks.  I had the regular burger.  It was unremarkable.  I went back last weekend figuring that they would have worked out the kinks in their system.  Plus, being a big fan of burgers, I wanted to give them another go.  I had the buffalo burger.  It was good, better than I expected, but again, uninspired.  There was little flavor to the meat and the burger was a bit soggy for my taste.  This surprised me since I cook using buffalo rather than beef fairly often.  And give that the place is owned by the same folks who own Mama Ricotta's, Cantina 1511, and some other fantastic restaurants, I would expect more.  Most of the flavor came from the toppings.  It had the usual lettuce, tomato, onions,  as well as fried onions, and chipotle mayo.  The chipotle mayo was ok.  I like mine with a little more kick.  The fries were average.  I wouldn't go as far as to say they were memorable.  For $11 I can get a better burger.  In fact, I can get a better burger for $3 at Five Guys.  It's a totally different dining experience, but you get the point.  The burgers are over priced.  The service was fantastic this trip.  Even though the place was full of 30 somethings and their kids, I didn't feel like I was ignored.  The drink special was great too.  You can't really beat $2 PBR tall boys.    Overall, I give three stars.  The service was great.  The drink special was awesome.  Those are really all that Big Daddy's has going for it.  Unless you like food that is overly safe but passes itself off as unusual and gourmet."}
{"text":"Overpriced food that is average at best, service is extremely lacking. No coffee refills no water had to flag someone down to even pay and get out of the place and it was not even busy. Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"This place has great music.. Great beer deals.. And a cool atmosphere. Burgers (veggie for me) are great. Salads are pretty good, but the price... a salad is $10 and is the size of a Denny's side salad! I don't understand that? Fries are good.. But all the other sides like tots and fried pickles are very salty. Maybe to sell more beer? Shakes are incredible!   All in all... pretty good place."}
{"text":"I can make a better burger at home. Those machine formed patties at Publix are better than the burger they served me. The burger was so plain! My husband had the chicken sandwich and he said it was very dry and plain. Fries were cold and soggy. Never again."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner before going to the Belk theatre. Been her many times with good food etc. While waiting for our meal I killed a roach crawling up the wall beside me. Thank goodness there are paper towels on the table. I handed it to the server telling him what it was, he said \"thank you\"  Food arrived, ketchup bottle empty, handed another from another table, empty. Third arrived full. French fries were not even Luke warm. Went to rest room, passed 5 servers who seemed to be put out that I needed to walk by...smell from kitchen, bathroom and garbage was overwhelming obnoxious. Sadly disappointed. Roach unaddressed."}
{"text":"Went in for something light to eat for me, first impression high noise level ugh.  Ordered make my own salad got bacon bits on it halfway through bit into a piece of bone almost broke my tooth.  Manager came over and said well you did order bacon bits maybe it was that, I told her we couldn't cut it with a knife it was bone.  She apologized and went on her way.  I believe her name was Courtney talked to Jason who was another manager and told him she needed to learn some customer service.  Not trying to get free food here but she could have offered my something for my predicament, not that I would have wanted anything with meat.  Use caution when eating meat"}
{"text":"I love this place - sometimes you just want a real burger and that's what you get. Atmosphere is fun and it's always packed. Service is excellent so you can get in and out fast if you need to, or chill for a while and enjoy the weekend."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's had great homemade chips with a good homemade French onion dip.  Pimento cheese also was good with the chips.  The selection of burgers was excellent.  I had the special--the hangover burger.  It was very tasty with an egg and ham on it.  The selection of beers also was good.  You can eat inside or outside on the heated patio.  Plenty of tvs for sports viewing.  Good overall experience!"}
{"text":"Another update: went back with my husband and a friend to use the gift card. The food was great, again - I got the same burger (the french, turkey burger with brie & green apple) and it was amazing. We ordered the chili tater tots (not at my bidding) but I was won over (although they were amazingly messy). Overall, it's a little more family oriented than I usually choose for my dinners but a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger in Charlotte. They cook them to temperature (med-rare) for me, and not a lot of places can/will do that. They have a great selection of fresh toppings and their fries/tots always come out hot and crisp. This is another of my weekly places for lunch! It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great buffalo chicken wings! We also had the western burger which was pretty good and the southern burger which wasn't as great we had hoped. Overall the service was great and timely."}
{"text":"We'll after my last review the manager contacted me and asked me to try it again. So I did and it was a world of difference. The service was so much better this time. I took my in laws and they loved the food and service. We all got the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids and it was cooked to perfection. The sweet potato fries are very good as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food, friendly staff, fun atmosphere, great drinks and deserts as well. And we love the location of course! My favorites are the Frenchie (switched the turkey burger for a regular) and the truffle fries! The fried pickles are amazing too. And they make a mean margarita. Highly recommend and will always go back."}
{"text":"Just moved to town from the Boston area, for work. Came here for a work lunch. They were quick to seat and serve our party of 7.  I went back and forth on what burger i wanted. Settled on, \"bacon cheeseburger on steroids\". The name doesnt lie... After my first bite i realized how big this thing was. An anaconda would have a tough initial bite these burgers are so big.   Between the burger, and TOTS, i went back to my desk to basically spent the rest of my Friday in a well deserved food coma.   There are no burger joints like this where i grew up. Dont miss out on this one if you're near by."}
{"text":"Downside first:  slightly on the expensive side for burgers; service is average.  The bartenders are great, but frequently overworked.  Because they have so many menu/topping choices, they often mess up something small on a take-out order.  Parking can be a challenge during peak hours.  Positives:  Diverse and delicious burger choices; unique flavors you can't find at other places.  Good salads.  Great tots.  Great shakes.  Great patio for outdoor dining.  Casual place to have a great burger with friends.  Wait staff and bartenders work hard.  The positives far outweigh the negatives."}
{"text":"The place is bustling.. Went on a friday afternoon late lunch.. Although the wait time wasnt long.. U still got to wait to be seated.. But once seated.. Its all good.. The burgers are great.. The will be cooked to order..  You can create ur own burger too ... I didn't have the salad but got good reviews from friends around They have decent choice of beer too..    This place is a liitle noisy.. So if u r looking for quiet place then this is not for u..."}
{"text":"Wow cant complain big 24oz beer for $4 and the best burger ever!! Get the badass burger."}
{"text":"Really delicious burgers!  Loved all the toppings and the ability to have the burger cooked to order!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and now that I have moved away to a land of sub-par burgers, I am craving my Big Daddy fix.  The burgers are big and I never think I'm going to finish them, but they're so good I always do. I love all the different fry side options, especially the crispy, seasoned tater tots. It took me forever to try the Mama Ricotta's burger because it sounded kind of weird, but after I ordered it once, it was the only thing I got. It is AWESOME! The shakes (adult and virgin) are also really good - nice, thick, and not overly sweet.  The only drawbacks I've ever encountered were slow, forgetful service once when we had a party of about a dozen (understandably), and I thought that the turkey burger was overly greasy and not very good."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about Bad Daddy's through friends. I decided to try it out one day when I was in Berkdale for dinner.  First, I order the fried pickles for appetizer. Those were good but I think there was a smidge too much breading.   I got the pastrami burger. I enjoyed the concept and the flavor was there but I think it was poorly executed. It was a little on the greasy side. The sweet potato fries I had for a side were good.  Out waiter, who's name I don't remember was fantastic. That is why there are 3 stars instead of 2.   I probably won't come back or recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Showed up and ordered a to go order. Told 30 minutes waited over 50 minutes for 4 burgers. 2 ketchup cheese only, 2 mushroom. 2 with tater tots. 2 with fries.  Got home to find 4 with cold fries. And the 2 ketchup only burgers stacked with the works, lettuce, onions and such. Not a great first experience."}
{"text":"Just wanted to share my take-out experience.  Everything was perfect!  It was ready when I arrived, packaged nicely and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Good chili.  Good fries!  Best buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever tasted!!!  This location is in the opposite side if town for us - hope there's one closer to home!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Bad Daddy's (especially the location on East Blvd).   I've eaten at the airport location many times. The staff is friendly, food is consistent and drinks are cold.   I'm a big fan of the tater tots and fried pickles. My favorite item is the black bean burger (get it fried). My boyfriend loves the Sam I Am with the fried egg.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fun family spot. Kids loved all the burger choices (and chicken items) and the salads were big and delicious for the adults. Later night and lively crowd makes ideal for going out when other restaurants are already dying down. We'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. I found out about this restaurant a few years ago, and ever since then it has been a place that I know will never let me down. I make sure to make a visit to Bad Daddys at least once a month. The tater tots are out of this world, not to mention that the sauce that compliments them only makes them even better!   Although the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids, my favorite burger, never fails me. Great flavors that are packed within only one burger and a great atmosphere within the establishment itself. Although be warned the place can become pretty busy during peak hours, which can easily be avoided by download the nowait app and getting yourself in the wait line before you get there.  Like I said this a restaurant I've come to rely on over the years for great food and great service and I hope I'll be able to continue to rely on it in the years ahead."}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 but my burger was medium instead of medium well.  The Manager offered to make me another burger but I turned it down.  He said we could order a milkshake or pie on him.  He also deducted my meal from the bill.  Very customer oriented and you could tell customer satisfaction was very important to him.  The staff is very friendly and outgoing.  You can tell a good manager but how is staff interacts with customers.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I know this is a burger bar but i think they have the BEST milshakes in town!!!  try the Chocolate Peanut butter milkshake its amazing!!!!!!!!!!!  plus i like how they give you basically 2 milkshakes for the price of 1"}
{"text":"It's great to be home. Burgers melt in your mouth. Amazing workers and mouth watering food. Always reminds me of my childhood. Carolina favorite."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bad Daddy's.  My owner called ahead to make sure pups are allowed.  We were able to patronize the establishment as long as we dined on the patio (with me on the outside of the fence, is the rule.).  It was a wicked hot day and I'm a black dog!  I was grateful for the shade and many fans provided by management.  Everyone was soooo very nice to me.  The waitress offered to bring me water, but my owner already had a bowl and water bottle, along with some special treats to keep me from fraternizing with the other patrons.  My owner ordered the special of the day with tater tots.  She tells me they are the BEST tater tots in the country and she should know....she travels quite a bit. (Or at least she did until she adopted me!!)  The mac & cheese hamburger special was spectacular.  I know because she shared it with me.  Apparently I'm lactose intolerant so I did get any of the cheesy bits.  However, she gave me half of the delicious hamburger and the ALL of the rosemary ham it came with.  I couldn't have the tots since I'm only 6 months old...[not sure why that is relevant, but I trust her judgment.]  We will definitely come back for lunch.  Out of respect for the other guests, we'll likely not come during dinner since little kids LOVE me and would be distracted from eating their meals!  Thank you Big Daddy for being so welcoming!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Club for take-out.  The chicken was fried, not grilled, and tasted awful.  The french fries were greasy and limp.  Totally inedible. I won't be back.  My husband ordered the Classis Southern burger and was happy with it."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bacon burger has to be the topic of conversation at most cardiologist conventions. You have to order it. Bacon mayo?  Come on man that is a must."}
{"text":"After a week in Costa Rica we were in serious need of some good american food.  First off service was great with a few suggestions provided when asked.  Cold shock top on draft with tasty fried pickles was a great way to start the meal.  My wife had their bean burger which she said was very good. I had the burger with pastrami and it was delicious.  Pastrami was nice and thin which provided for great flavor and did not overwhelm the burger. The burger itself was tasty with good flavor.  I like it was seasoned as most burger joints leave it all to the toppings. We both had tater tots which were okay.  They could have been better as it appeared that the grease was due for a change out.  Overall this was a great experience, especially for airport food."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's serves one of the best burgers in Charlotte. Always cooked perfectly, with a wide variety of standard and eclectic sides. The sweet potato fries are a can't miss option.  I like the Sam-I-Am burger with a fried egg and pesto sauce, my wife likes a simpler bacon burger.  Everything we have ordered has been excellent every time we've been there.  Skip the fried pickles, they are too greasy and too salty.  They use pickles cut long ways and they get too soft when cooked.  I prefer fried pickles from The Penguin.  The wait on the weekends is always too long for a burger, usually at least an hour, and they don't have any place to sit inside while you wait.  Despite the wait I still look forward to going to Big Daddy's for a burger.  They just opened a new store in Ballantyne, I'm hoping to try it out soon."}
{"text":"Great food! Best burgers I've had. Love that it's different and not just boring regular toppings. Always busy, but they do a good job with service considering. The outdoor area is always packed. Get there supper early if you want any chance of sitting outdoors."}
{"text":"Have eaten at the dillworth location a few yrs ago and decided to try the Ballantyne location. What a big mistake!!! While the restaurant was not busy as you would think it would be the server was not very attentive. The food was loaded with salt, it was like eating a salt lick. The burger was overly salty along with the fries. Not to mention that I was sick for 2 days after eating there starting the night I ate there. They must add lots of seasoning to the meat to preserve the freshness and have the ability to keep unused meat longer. I was very disappointed since the last time I ate at one of franks scabelis restaurants the food was so good.  So if salt is an issue do not eat here. Sadly I will not be back."}
{"text":"If you want a salt-bomb burger, this is your place.  Burgers are over salted to the point of being uneatable (chicken sandwiches too!).  I tried four times thinking it was just a couple bad experiences, but each time it was more of the same... burgers were basically salt-licks.  Their saving grace initially was the tater tots and onion straws, but those too are over salted.  Save yourself the high blood pressure and make your own burger at home.  At least then you can control your salt intake."}
{"text":"Wow - this joint was a complete disappointment- the breakfast menu is no clear, I ordered 3 eggs scrambled and got 2, I order whole wheat and got regular flour soggy toasts, got the bacon burned check. I am not that picky but I could do a much better job."}
{"text":"If you ever feel like eating really unhealthy,  and feeling stuffed for hours this place is where you need to be.  My bf and I shared some Tater Tot nachos, they totally scream southern comfort, but were  good. He then had the Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids and I build a simple burger. Both burgers were tasty, just a bit salty. The service was great. Maybe next time I'll just do a chicken salad with a side of sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Coming from Atlanta it is hard not to compare this to Flip Burger and feel slightly disappointed.  Most likely this isn't a place you'd go looking for a truly gourmet burger but more or less a greasy burger with a large variety of toppings and flavors.  I was glad to have the option to create my own burger when I couldn't quite find just the right mix on the menu.    Saturday lunch is quite crowded with families/kids but the wait wasn't terrible.  The sweet potato fries were a thin cut, nice texture.  The tater tots were well cooked but perhaps the oil could be a little cleaner.    My husband got the Bahn Mi pork burger.  It was a little greasy but the flavors were good.  I created a turkey burger.  It was a little charred for my preference.    The beer selection/variety was good with local brews from NC as well as other states including imports such as Chimay.  I noticed they have shake specials but didn't have the room for dessert.  There is a bar area and outdoor seating.  I can do without a television at every venue in town while I'm trying to eat!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided we wanted a juicy burger for lunch today. After some yelp review help, we decided on Bad Daddy's Burgers.  Boy oh boy were we in heaven!!   Our server was extremely attentive and gave us his recommendation for the \"Sam I am.\" My husband and I both ordered this beautifully crafted mouth watering and scrumptious burger. We had it on a wheat bun and it was topped off with an over easy egg, pickles, lettuce, and tomato. I have to say... THAT WAS THE BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN YEARS!! I ate the whole entire monterous thing! The sweet potato fries and regular fries were also amazing. Both of my boys thoroughly enjoyed their chicken tenders and sliders as well.   After our meal was nearly finished, the manager also came over and introduced herself and made sure we were enjoying ourselves and our meal.   The service here was truly exceptional  and I'm glad we made the decision we did today.... Go to Bad Daddy's if you want a bad @$$ burger and service!"}
{"text":"The Burgers and Chicken in this place are amazing and big!!! No human being should eat all of this in one sitting. Unless your run a half marathon before you come here. Tater Tots are very very good here."}
{"text":"Bad Daddys burgers and tater tots are legendary have a nice bar selection of beers and the staff there is always very helpful and nice. But don't buy an appetizer because the burgers are so big normal human being should not be getting this for Burgrove by themselves.  Monja Mongite ETD to eat."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Bad Daddy's Burger Bar for quit some time now. I heard their burgers were delicious, and I just haven't been able to find out for myself.  So tonight I had a burger with practically everything on it (pretty cool considering you can build your burger, type of meat and literally everything from the ground up,) and I will tell you it was absolutely delicious. Although the burger could've been a little bit thicker, but REGARDLESS what will keep me coming back is the server Stephanie Ellison! Hands down the best waitress I have ever had!! She was very professional, etiquette, and naturally a very cheerful person. She never minded going that extra step to grab a sauce or condiment (considering there are over 30+!) I went out of my realm tonight by going to Bad Daddy's Burger, but because of the food and superior service this is my new burger bar!!! Thank you Stephanie and Bad Daddy's! A must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger!  I ordered the cantina burger with a beef patty rather than the black bean.  It was the perfect size.  I debated on ordering the small salad as my side but opted for the fries this time.  They were pretty good also but the burger was definitely the star, as it should be!  The food came out very fast even though the restaurant was full for lunch.  Our waiter, Antwan talked me into getting a shake for dessert...not that he really had to twist my arm though.  I can wait to go back and try a different burger! Solid 5!"}
{"text":"Great service, great ambiance, delicious food. Not too greasy. When they say they'll cook your burger Medium, you actually get a medium - slightly pink in middle. I always get a doggie bag - the portions are generous. Sat on the patio, music was a little louder than I'd prefer (had to hear at my old age)."}
{"text":"I was not wowed by this particular spot. My daughter thought  her hamburger was out of this world. My wife and I both felt differently. I think this place is just a little bit overpriced for what it is. If you overcook your sweet potato fries in old oil it makes me think what else are they not doing correctly."}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago and the food and service was great. I came back and the food/service failed. My food was over cooked and the service wasn't great. Moreover, I called the manager the next day and shared my experience with him. He told me that he would replace my food and refund my money. I shared that I payed with a temporary credit card. For the record I never received my refund... It's ok, I'm not going to argue over 24.00 dollars.   I decided to return two weeks later, \"today\"... Server was nice, I ordered fried pickles which where way to salty and bacon burger. Burger was ok! The manager came to speak to me and I told him about the credit card payment. He told me that he doesn't know why I didn't get my payment. I told him, I wasn't going to argue about the money that was owed to me. Ohhhh well... Probably will not return. When this place was called BIG Daddy's everything was a lot better."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this burger joint! Making my own burger with Brie and sautéed mushrooms is to die for, plus my parties is a grass fed! Consistent every time I've gone. Also, the bad daddy's sauce is to die for with this crunchy amazing tots!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers! 3 words... Deep Fried Bacon... enough said. Can't wait to go back. If you're ever in Charlotte and get a burger craving, check this place out."}
{"text":"$10.81 beers, bartenders that ask 44 yr olds for ID either because they are tough guys or their boss doesn't allow them to exercise common sense, and pretty good burgers.  The burger elevates the 2-star $10.81 ID for a beer experience for this 44 yr old to 3-Stars.  Lose the puritanical bullshit folks."}
{"text":"Juicy delicious burger even in gluten free option.   Favorite patty of cows meat.   Must visit charlotte spot for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to grab some lunch so we looked at the reviews and saw Bad Daddy's and decided burgers and beer sounded good. The decor is really cool and it was busy for lunchtime but we were seated right away. Our server was a nice college aged school kid and he seemed pretty knowledgable about the beers they had on tap we went with his suggestion and it wasn't bad. We ordered the fried pickles and they were GREAT but they were a little too salty but that's what the beer is for right! My husband also ordered Irish Nachos but I was not impressed. They were supposed to be topped with an Irish Cheddar Sauce......we were expecting some kind of curry flavor since that's traditionally how it is up North in NY.  And it was topped  with an over easy egg which was cooked but KUDOS  to the manager because he saw it and had another egg brought out STAT. The yolky goodness from the egg over the  fries was a good addition to the flavor. I must make mention again TOO SALTY.   As for my bacon burger on steroids it was pretty nice to look at. The spicy mayo was awesome.  But I couldn't finish eating it because some one in the  kitchen really has a heavy hand on the salt. One of the bites of my burger was so bad I had to spit it out. I feel the food could be good but something that they are using/doing is overly salty.   The beer selection was awesome and my husband LOVED his burger with battered bacon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Amazing food & service. I love the BYO Salad & the Balsamic Vinaigrette is the best I've ever had. The service is excellent every single time & Sunday-Thursday, there's usually no wait & we get in & out within 45 minutes. Fast, friendly service & fantastic food. I wish I could give 10 stars. :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy bad daddy's - the frenchie burger is very good. The one thing I find hit or miss are the fries. Also the service can be spotty at times."}
{"text":"My favorite place to enjoy a turkey burger and sweet potato fries. Good food and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty laid back atmosphere. My girlfriend doesn't really like it because she doesn't eat ground beef, but she tried the buffalo burger last time we went and she liked it a lot. That's great because I really love the burgers here!  4 stars and not 5 because I still feel bad bringing her here since there's not many options besides burgers. Wish I could come here with her more  *** updated to 5 stars.  We have a favorite waiter there who always recognizes us, and we always get great service. Gf loves the black bean burger with a buffalo burger substitute. Yes!!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  We tried the basic burger and Nick's patty melt and it was cooked to perfection...medium well which is actually pink throughout.  The fried pickles and sweet potato fries were also amazing...and great drinks; we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food at Bad Daddy's is just fantastic! Literally, mouthwatering! The only reason this location is getting 4 stars instead of 5, is because the experience and service I had was better at the Dilworth location. I'll definitely change my rating, if my next experience is better."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's was great!! The beer selection was fun! The service ( we sat at the bar) was awesome!! I had a burger with blue cheese, onions and mushrooms and tater tots, it was amazing!!  My husband had the Bad A$$ Burger with sweet pot fries and he really enjoyed it!!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bad Daddy's Burger the other day, and it was awesome. The homemade potato chips with the cheese dip is delicious. We also shared the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. The burger tasted great, but it was very messy and didn't hold together at all. Even though it was messy I would go back in a heartbeat to get another."}
{"text":"Is it Bad or Big Daddys??? Whatever you call it, it is damn good! The burgers here are amazingly good! You have to try the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids!!!!! Ultimate! The service is top notch also. Place a to-go order over the phone and when I got there the order was not in the system. The server took care of us right away. Give us a free app and dessert. Love me some Bad Daddy's!"}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious (regular and the turkey). We tried the sweet potato fries and the tater tots. Both were good and the accompanying dipping sauces were on point. Service was quick too."}
{"text":"I've been passing through the Charlotte airport a lot recently, and decided to try Bad Daddy's.    I flew in on a cold and rainy Tuesday, and was looking at a three hour layover, so I passed the time by eating at the bar at Bad Daddy's.    It's not a huge location -- maybe 80 seats total -- but the burger was one of the best I have ever eaten, especially in an airport.   They have a lot of custom burgers on the menu, but I decided to start with something really simple:   the basic burger with mozzarella cheese, cooked medium.    What arrived about 10 minutes later was a stunning masterpiece of flavor -- perfectly cooked burger topped with a massive amount of mozzarella cheese.    I opted for the tater tots (nice and crunchy), and somehow managed to finish everything.      With a menu like the one they have, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Cantina 1511 burger, aka the black bean burger, is one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life.  The tater tots are freshly fried and crispy, but I'm not a fan of the sauce that comes with them.  The milkshakes are also pretty good.  Parking is kind of a pain in the ass.  If you can't find a spot in the tiny lot, you park on the street... like WAY far down the street.  I would hate to live in this neighborhood with the amount of cars parked there all the time.  However, the food is too delicious for the parking sitch to affect my rating.  Also, pretty much no matter what time you go, you will wait.  It is ALWAYS crowded.  It's also incredibly loud inside, but nice and mellow on the patio.  Be warned, it is a LOT of food.  I have a rather large appetite and I always leave uncomfortably full and go into a food coma shortly thereafter."}
{"text":"Yum!! Had the buffalo burger which was nice and juicy. The fries were meh...don't care crinkle cut fries. Had the beer queso which was really nasty!! Asked the waitress if it has a beer taste and she said no...that it cooked out....should have gone with my instinct This was my first time here so will give it another try!"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's in Birkdale is a little down the road for us from work but when you have a burger hunger it is worth the trip.  I usually get either a salad (which are excellent) or the tuna burger.  Since the tuna is sushi grade you can order it as rare as you like and you will be happy.  Often i will order the sweet potato fries as a side (with BBQ sauce) but this last lunch I got the tatter tots, which are awesome.  They came out a little short so the kitchen sent me what amounted to another order for free which was appreciated.    Fixings on items can become expensive and I do not like that they charged me .75c for extra slaw on the tuna burger but overall the service is prompt, portions are generous, and prices are reasonable.  I can without reservation recommend for a casual fun lunch."}
{"text":"My go-to cheat meal location when I'm in Charlotte! Exceptional burgers and great customizable salads too! The adult milk shakes are also always a crowd favorite."}
{"text":"I love the Frenchie (turkey burger).  I will probably get it every time I come here.  The sweet potato fries are delicious too.  Can't go wrong with the bacon cheeseburger mac and cheese either.  Whenever a friend or family member comes to visit, I try to take them here.  They always love it.  Overall, this is a great place if you are in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"First off, best fries pickles ever. Sweet potato fries are pretty good but not amazing. I had the tree hugger salad (my favorite kind of salad) with spinach, fruit and nuts, definitely wortg ordering again. Also have had the frenchie, but with a beef patty instead of Turkey- and the build your own is good- bleu cheese is strong! Very small parking lot but in well lit, safe area."}
{"text":"Too much stress today in this place. Take-out took more than 30 minutes"}
{"text":"After being told there was a 30 minute wait on our first visit (Saturday of March Madness games), we only waited about 15 minutes.  Our server was great, very friendly and gave great suggestions about which burger to try, or which was more popular than another.  I had the black bean burger, which was wonderful and VERY filling.  My husband had an actual beef burger which he enjoyed but had to eat with a fork because it was so messy (he didn't seem to care!).  The manager came by to be sure everything was fine, which I appreciated.  Our waiter tended to our needs and drink refills without bothering us too much so we could talk.  It was loud in there, but there was a party of about.  Overall, we will definitely go back. Sweet potato fries are FANTASTIC, and I would love to try their Build-your-own salads.  You must visit it at least once!!"}
{"text":"Great burger spot! I like turkey burgers and am a picky eater- you can build your own burger with your choice of chicken, beef burger, turkey burger, etc. you pick the bun too -wheat bun, Texas toast,rye bun, no bun etc. and of course you choose your toppings. Lots of restaurants in an airport have limited menus but I felt like there was something for everyone on the menu here. Service was great too!! Chicken tortilla soup is a must."}
{"text":"Hostess had an attitude like she did not give a damn. I was excited to try this place because I heard a lot about it. When we got our food, both my burger and my side were incorrect..The burger had mayo on it, and I wanted fries but got tots. They remade my burger but this time the temperature was luke warm. After a few bites it was practically cold. Not a great experience....2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Amaze balls! This place is fricken ridiculous.  Great service.   My husband and I came here late one night within an hour from closing. Our service was so great you would have thought we were our waitress' first customer.   I got some crazy extraordinary chicken sandwich (on the menu-with avocado,etc) and my husband ordered the signature burger with bison. Both were scrumptious. I even tried their signature drink - dragonberry liquor concoction.... Stupidly yum."}
{"text":"Tots and dipping sauce - spectacular!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger around!  Big Daddy's never fails to deliver the exact burger you want.  It's just up to you to order it.  The only problem with the burgers are that they may not fit in your mouth...other than that...spectacular.  Prices are reasonable for a better hamburger joint.  Beer specials are always nice.  Stay away from:  The fried pickes...not good for fried pickles."}
{"text":"Tater tots and a couple of beers...right in the middle of being insanely packed.  Five minutes tops!  I couldn't have been more impressed with the speed of the service here.  The tater tots and cold ones were great.    The amount of space...fairly cramped.  I would give Bad Daddy's another go if I was down this concourse again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!!! We lived in Charlotte and LOVED Bad Daddy's but their airport location does NOT do them justice. We had a flight that stopped in CLT and we were excited when we saw that they had a location in the airport... I wish I never had that experience. HORRIBLE and again, EXTREMELY disappointed at the quality of the food. I am hesitant of ever recommending Bad Daddy's in the airport to any co-worker."}
{"text":"We were sad to see the pork patties off the menu. We haven't had one thing on the menu so far that we did not like."}
{"text":"The BEST BURGER I've ever had. I've enjoyed decent burgers at restaurants but this one was just WOW. I ordered the Western Burger with BBQ sauce and onions plus a side of sweet potato fries - and what flavor. The bun, the meat, every bite seemed to get better and better and didn't realize burgers could be this good.   I know this is an airport location but the food was truly fantastic. And service was fast and friendly. I'm highly disappointed we don't have Bad Daddy's in California..."}
{"text":"My assigned gate was next to Bad Daddy Burger so decided to give it a try since I had a quick layover.  I ordered at the takeout window and received a buzzer to pick up food.  I thought my buzzer may not be working and went back twice in a 15 minute period.  The third time in approaching the window my buzzer went off.  Yes it was a long wait but definitely worth it.  My white cheddar cheese burger was flavorful, hot and juicy.  The fries dipped in the barbecue sauce was very tasty.  I'm disappointed that I can't find a location in NY but will make sure to check this out on my next layover!"}
{"text":"Great service, Devine cantina burger with sweet potatoes; scrumptious jalapeño and feta burger with tater tots! The perfect end to a great summer vacation. The fact that it's .3 miles from Freedom Park and 6 miles from CLT was awesome!"}
{"text":"\"Best Burgers in Town!!!!\"  When I'm craving a burger, I always go to Bad Daddies. My 2 favorite burgers are the Western Bison burger and Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. I always choose tater tots, extra crispy and the bad daddies sauce on the side. And lets not forget the angry orchard cider on draft in an ice cold glass to wash it all down. Bad Daddies is my burger go to every time!!!"}
{"text":"The burger is not the best, but it is one of the most decent place in the airport. The relish condiment is good, and so is the sweet potato fries. I also had the strawberry milkshake which was thick and lotsa strawberry flavor in it - as expected for a milkshake."}
{"text":"Get to bad daddy's this month for the burger special. It has peach salsa and jalapeño goat cheese topping. Oh wow! I had one the first week of August and have found myself craving another one. I'll definitely be back before the end if the month for another one. It was crowded so we sat at the bar. Our service was great. Even though I forgot to order a gluten free bun the fixed my order. Very friendly. Love it here."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and noticed Bad Daddy's. My wife and I returned for dinner that evening for our date night. This was our first time dining at a Bad Daddy's. We had frequented the Five Guys near there on many occasions to get a decent burger. Seeing how we were both in the mood for a good burger,  we decided to give Bad Daddy's a try. Oh my goodness what an incredible experience. The food was absolutely delicious and the service was incredible. First the food. We started off with their fried pickles...quite an incredible start. I had the Bad Ass burger...which was ginormous and my wife had the chicken club. Yes she was in the mood for a burger but changed her mind when she looked over the menu. We did share the burger and club. The best of both worlds. Now the service. We were greeted by this very nice and sweet young lady by the name Libby. She started off by giving me a hard time for wearing a beautiful blue UNC shirt. The reason she started off with the hard time is because she is a NC State grad. I enjoyed her giving me a hard time. Thank God she was not a Duke grad. Libby was an incredible person and gave us great service. Do yourselves a favor a visit this restaurant and ask for Libby to be your server. You will not reget it."}
{"text":"Everyone loves this place, there is always a line.  My bison burger was dry.  I don't get the hype.  Location and atmosphere is great, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Charlotte to get a Turkey Burger. Lots of flavor! The sweet potato fries are also a favorite and are perfectly crispy!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent waitress named Jane, our burgers were first rate & the draft beer was cold! We had a short wait but not bad. We will return periodically for our burger fix. I may even try a salad."}
{"text":"The food was ok,  we weren't fans of the buttermilk bacon on the burgers.  The kids meals were pretty good.  But the service was slow and not attentive.  After we got our food, he came back once, I asked for a drink refill and he never returned. We had to track down someone to get our bill.  Overall, not worth it and other better burger places with better service.   Too bad as we were looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Bad A** Burger:   Okay, it is the actual name of the burger I had lol. It was amazing! It's topped with anything I wanted, a special sauce, the beef is mixed with bacon, we asked for pepper jack cheese, and it's a double decker. I split it with my husband. The fries were also excellent, as were the different sauces. I had a greek shake, which I was leery about at first, but my oh my! It was good.   After writing this, I think it's time to go grab some lunch in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Tuna Burger, ginger peanut slaw...amazing!"}
{"text":"Can you say baconaise?! Went to bad daddy's with the family and had a great experience, had their classic burger and added american cheese and jalapeno bacon. It comes with sliced pickles, which should be a must on every great burger. The meat was a little overcooked, but super flavorful and the bacon and pickles added some nice depth.   My wife had a build-your-own salad and she said it was good, the portion was huge. Love that they have berries that you can add to it, along with some of the crunchy options.   Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Not good.  We were in Atlanta discussing where to eat for our 2-hour layover when someone who said he lives in Charlotte said Bad Daddy's was great - the best burger he's ever had.  We should have asked him if he's had the burger at Spotted Pig in NYC or Craigie on Main in Cambridge.  We've had really good burgers.  Still, his enthusiasm intrigued us.  The burgers were not good at all.  I ordered the western and my husband ordered a custom burger.  His was barely edible.  The staff seemed very unhappy to be at work.  There was trash and food on the floor.  The fries and tater tots are also very unmemorable.  We ended up wishing we'd eaten at McDonald's.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come to Charlotte I make it a point to eat here. So much variety from a burger joint it's incredible. The Emilio chicken sandwich is usually my go to because of the giant slice of mozzarella. A side of sweet potato fries with pimento cheese is also a must!"}
{"text":"Aubrey was the waitress. Quick, prompt, accurate, sweet and very helpful. Make sure you ask for her when you arrive. Food was excellent. Very quick. If you like pastrami you have to try the pastrami burger. Wow!"}
{"text":"Big Daddy's is pretty legit.  The atmosphere is bustling and fun, and the food is innovative for a burger bar.  Likes:  Fun menu, variety of good side items, good place to watch a game and get decent food, good beer on tap.  Dislikes:  The setup of tables is a little odd, so I often feel like there's little room to stretch out.  Big Daddy's is little pricey, with the interesting burgers costing about $9 to $10 or more.  Take it or leave it:  Take it.  Big Daddy's is a fun time.  They have good food, beer, and tv's for watching a big game."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this place had some great quality menu items and ingredients. I recommend the \"Frenchie\", a turkey burger with melted brie cheese, sliced and grilled granny smith apples, and applewood smoked bacon. The unique flavor combinations are a big plus here, as well as the laid back atmosphere. It's a bit pricey, but the food is consistent. The service is a bit slow and inattentive, but friendly nonetheless. As long as you have a little extra time to spare, this place is great, 4 stars.   P.S, there is usually a wait time, so for large groups definitely call ahead, or plan to eat during slower business hours."}
{"text":"Oh please order the nachos  the food here is phenomenal, literally all of it, but I almost missed the nachos being so caught up in the amazing burger selection. Please don't! Try it all, step out of your comfort zone and you will be so happy you did, the place gets pretty crowded and the parking lot is a nightmare, but who cares? Great food= worth it"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was awesome. Our server Manny was awesome, he asked what we wanted and made suggestions.  He definitely knew the menu, and made a great suggestion for drinks,  even offered a sample. We both for the second time  ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. ..it was awesome everything came out hot and fresh and pretty fast. Manny checked on us through out the meal. And made sure we had a good experience.  I will be back again,  and again."}
{"text":"This review is a couple of months overdue, but I've been a little busy at work, due time to catch up.  Food quality was good, no problems here. I had the BAD A** BURGER. a mile high creation with beef/bacon patties, fried bacon, you get the picture. Well for $13.00 I was a bit disapointed. The flavors were great, but at most burger places ( no not McDonalds...lol)  $8.00 or $9.00 gets you a really good burger. I just can't see where this was worth an additional $5.00,  One nice thing is that they do have a gluten free menu and this is what my wife ordered from.   Our bill came up to $27.00 and that was with a coupon my wife had for buy one entree for regular price and get the second for 1/2 off, no beer, so our bill would have been in the $33-$35 range without the coupon.  Still I suppose with the location that their overhead is quite high.   I guess I'm just more of Mom and Pop type of person."}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here! We have not been disappointed yet. The nachos as a starter are delicious and huge! We haven't been able to finish our meal yet. Everything has been great and service is spot on."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's is a solid place with a lot of fun variations on the burger and an awesome beer list. The burgers are good and there are pork, turkey and veggie options, if beef isn't your thing. There are also a ton of variations on the menu, as well as options to create your own. It also has a gluten-free menu!"}
{"text":"Enter this restaurant at your own risk!  On December 28, 2015, I slipped on a greasy slippery floor when entering the restaurant.  My accident resulted in a ruptured left hamstring, surgery, and now I'm confined to a chair for 6 weeks.  Therapy will take another 12 weeks or more. I have mounting medical bills and cannot work.  This restaurant denies any claim and refuses to help pay for medical bills.  They say there was nothing wrong with the floor even though they have other complaints about slippery floors.  It was a very poor decision to enter this establishment.  If you were there when I had my accident on 12/28/2015, I would love to hear from you."}
{"text":"I should have gone in with zero expectations but alas, I did not. I have read so many fabulous reviews of Big Daddy's and decided to check it out for myself before the Panthers game yesterday.   I was surprised that we easily found a parking place in the back of the restaurant and was practically shocked when we were seated right away! The restaurant itself is pretty tiny and the tables are alarmingly close together. The beer selection is strong but pretty pricey for a burger joint and their house brew isn't anything special at over 3 bucks so I would pay the extra to get something you know you are really going to like. I ordered the Cantina 1511 black bean burger  with onion straws and my boyfriend ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with tater tots.   Our food came out really quickly and I was pleasantly surprised by the huge portion sizes. My burger came with avocado, green chilies, cheese, and chipotle ranch. The burger was good. That's it. It wasn't fabulous and I was not blown away. My boyfriend's burger came with six pieces of bacon, cheese, and baconnaise and literally screamed bacon but it really was not that fantastic either. However, we really enjoyed our sides. The onion straws were very crispy and came with a great chipotle sauce and the tater tots came with Big Daddy sauce which was amazing!  I literally could not control myself from finishing off my onion straws and diving into my boyfriend's tater tots!  Big Daddy's is a really unique burger joint with a great selection of side dishes but as for the burger, my favorite Charlotte burger joints are in no danger of being replaced."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend. Really cool atmosphere. Great beer selection. A little overpriced. SUPER GREASY.  Seriously though - after I left, I felt like all my insides were coated with grease. I needed a shower immediately.  Despite the grease, the burger was awesome! My burger was just topped with a fried egg and bacon and it went really well together.  The serving sizes were pretty big, I got a side of tater tots and hardly put a dent in the bowl considering I was full after a few bites of the burger.  Neat place, tasty food, good beer... Just be prepared to wipe your mouth after every bite!"}
{"text":"gave me horrible food poison, from the chicken sandwich and tata tots. bar staff where friendly but clearly someone messing up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We have been to their south location and wished to try this one. We found that they had  changed their chili recipe as well and have added pork to it. Even though we were told by two different employee's, one being our waiter, that it was all beef. So we ordered the all beef hot dog and a buffalo burger with fries. The fries were served in a separate dish so I dumped them out onto my plate only to find that on the very bottom was a 2\" piece of fried bacon. The wife and I almost lost our lunch right there. How disgusting. We made it perfectly clear that we do not partake of the swine when we first got there and was hoping that they would respect that. We will never go back to Bad Daddy's EVER and hope anyone with special diet concerns think twice before going as well."}
{"text":"We had went there for the purpose of getting some of their chili and found out that they had just changed their recipe like within the past couple of days and that they had started putting pork/swine in the chili. Not only the chili that they serve in a cup/bowl but also the chili that would go on their chili cheese ALL BEEF hot dogs, chili cheese fries, and chili cheese burgers. We decided to forego the food and leave after a couple of cold ones. Got to try a new beer that they had on draft which was o.k. Not sure that we would go back."}
{"text":"Young lady running out orders was eating pixie sticks (sugary straw crap) right at the food window?  Kinda gross.  Restaurant was also a pigsty with a lot of dirty tables and food all over the ground.  Food was ok.  The 1lb basket of wings is not a pound either lol."}
{"text":"A frequent visitor to Big Daddy's and Cantina 1511, this is one our restaurant stops on many weekends.  Breakfast is great on Saturdays and Sundays - pancakes are a hit with the kids, while I like the egg scrambles and jalepeno bacon.  For lunch and dinner you can't go wrong with many of the eclectic gourmet burgers or build your own salads.  Service is typically good and the patio is always popular in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's food is very good but service and attitude can be a little spotty at this location.   Specifically, Bad Daddy's is a poor choice for group get togethers. Last month, a group of 10 of us had reserved a table right at 5PM for a post-work get together. The restaurant was nearly empty when 6 of us showed up - 2 folks had a firedrill come up at the office they were tending to and the other 2 had gotten lost on the way to the restaurant. The hostess refused to seat us until everyone else arrived, which we found ridiculous, given that at most, 2 other tables in the restaurant were occupied and no one was waiting for a table besides us. We wanted to sit down after a long day and have drinks while we waited for our friends, but we couldn't do that until everyone was rounded up and accounted for.  I completely understand this policy at peak hours, when you can't have 2 people taking up a table for 10, but to set the policy in stone at non-peak hours when the restaurant is empty isn't good business. They lost extra drink sales while six of us stood awkwardly at the front door of a nearly empty restaurant waiting for a few minutes. Finally when the 2 lost teammates arrived they relented and gave us a table for 8, which they made sure we knew was \"against their usual policy\". With a sea of empty tables around us they wouldn't pull over an extra two top until our coworkers who had to deal with an issue at work arrived 20 minutes later - when the restaurant was still cavernously empty.  The food at Bad Daddy's is very good but I'm not a traditional burger fan. On this last visit, I searched for my favorite, the Banh Mi burger (which is a pork burger) only to find it's been taken off the menu. I had a hard time choosing between all of the other options, since they didn't really appeal to me. It's a shame they removed my favorite option. Their menu is somewhat limited.  If other people want to go to Bad Daddy's, I'll go with them, but after this last visit, I see no reason to initiate going there myself."}
{"text":"When I think of burgers I think of Bad Daddy's the burgers are always Top Notch beef but what keeps me coming back is the Bad Daddy's sauce that they serve with the housemade potato chips it's well worth it. You can even take some home. A friend of mine is serving in Qatar and this waiter helpd me out with a pint for the troops. Awesome food awesome service"}
{"text":"Probably the worst burger I've ever had. We stopped here for lunch on a layover and waited in excess in 30 minutes for our food. During that time, I did not see one food order come out of the kitchen. I did see a lot of BSing by the waitstaff in the prep area, though.  Eating the burger was a challenge. Grease had soaked through the bottom bun and liquified it, so I just ate the patty which was medium rare (I had ordered medium well). The sweet potato fries had probably been made very early that day or the day before. They were cold and stale.  I would have rather had McDonald's--at least I wouldn't have killed my whole connection waiting for the food."}
{"text":"The wonderful, delicious irony for me regarding Big Daddy's Burger Bar is that for all their yummy burger selections, I always gravitate towards their grilled chicken sandwich, maybe the best grilled chicken sandwich in town. And their salads are quite delicious, too. BDBB also features a chef's special, and many times I've been pleased with the chef's choice.  We always get very good, very friendly service, and the hostesses up front are always pleasant. The only things I don't care for are the amount of flat-screen TVs always tuned to some lame college football game, and the obnoxiously loud classic rock station on Sirius Radio that plays utterly terrible classic rock tunes you never want to hear again.  Expect some lengthy waits around lunchtime, and on weekends.  (PS - this review is in reference to the Ballantyne location.)"}
{"text":"Man this place is great!  Great atmosphere friendly staff, oh yeah the food is good too! Endless burger combos and TATER TOTS!  Nothing like a good burger and a tall beer!  oh and congrats on the top 25 best burger in the usa"}
{"text":"Gotta love the milkshakes here, love me some bad daddy's. Friendly staff and very convenient. Waitstaff accessible at all hours."}
{"text":"The first time I stopped in here, was a last minute type deal and was somewhat dragged in. I wanted to hate this place, and expected the food to be nothing special, well I was completely wrong. The turkey burger along with the bun were both excellent! Hard to find a turkey burger on a menu at most places, you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. However, our waitress ruined our experience. First, she did not greet the table. Second, she's didn't want to take my drink order. She failed to ask how the food was and if everything was okay..... and the icing on the cake: I ordered the cheapest glass of Chardonnay on the menu ($5). Turns out when I got my bill I was charged for a $9 glass of wine and had to ASK the waitress why I was charged extra. Apparently they were out of the kind I asked for but I was never made aware of that specific detail....."}
{"text":"Had a frenchie burger today with the Kobe beef. One of the best burgers I have ever had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We are adults.  We want to leave the kids at home and go have an adult burger... with an adult milkshake.  You want burgervana.  Big Daddy's will do the trick just fine. There are plenty of beer options and a full bar.  If you have to bring the non-adults, then there are menu items for the entire family.  Just go here and enjoy.    Décor: 4 out of 5 Food:  4 out of 5 Drinks:  4 out of 5 Service: 4 out of 5 Cleanliness:  4 out of 5"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We go in on a Saturday night and they told us 15 minutes for a table, not a problem at all. 15 minutes go by and we watch two tables get seated in front of us that arrived after we did. My boyfriend mentioned it to the hostess who proceeds to tell us some lame excuse why and then just says, \"actually you're wrong.\" Not a way to treat your customers. Unreal."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Dilworth location is good too, just too cramped and small.  I've eaten here a dozen times, and everything I've ordered came out great.  Seriously good burgers.  I also love the mac n cheese and the tater tots.  They also have a great beer selection, which goes with their menu perfectly.  I highly recommend Big Daddy's!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, a waiter who didn't care and the wrong eggs. Didn't remove the disgusting scrambled eggs off my plate...just brought the new ones and I had to transfer everything else off the plate... Now cold by the way."}
{"text":"We frequent this place probably weekly (hate to admit). Really consistent on their food especially the White Hut burger which is not on the menu. It's a all beef patty with a warm bun and grilled onions. Pretty simple but taste great! On a side note, the weekend breakfast are great too! Well priced children's menu plus usually no wait time for the am weekend breakfast.   The only downside is that the waitstaff which is usually great, there are two servers who have a bad attitudes (names withheld)."}
{"text":"Really tasty--good food, good service, good beer list--everything you want out of a nice burger joint. While I'm sure the beef burgers are amazing, it's worth noting that you can get other kinds of burgers and sandwiches here as well. I had the Emilio's chicken sandwich--buttermilk fried chicken, poblano mayo, jalapeno bacon, guac--and it was delicious! My boyfriend had the ahi tuna burger with asian slaw, which was also stunningly good. Even the veggie burger looked like it would be good (made from cashews and edamame!), not just the boring patty of cardboard you usually get--I want to try it next time. In sum, you don't have to eat beef to enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place for breakfast. We had about 45 mins to eat and the place was not that busy but staffed well.   Once we were seated our waitress came to take our drink orders. My allergies took a left turn so water was a go. As much as I like orange juice, I was in concert mode already and just too excited to be closer to Baltimore. So we both opted to get a beer and shot deal for $10. Not bad too bad.    Next in line was the food. The burgers looked good and also backed by a few other reviews. I went with the 'breakfast' burger but can't remember the exact name. After we placed our orders we noticed the placed started to fill up, quick. We got their just in time before a huge rush.   The food arrived about 20 mins later and was great. I ordered my burger well done so the wait was expected. It came between two hot buns, topped with melted cheese, two slices of bacon, and an over easy made egg on top. The fries came well seasoned too. This is just how I wanted my meal, a well cooked burger with runny egg yoke.   After we ate it did take a while for our check to arrive and pay. At this point all the staff was busy and you could see the frustration in the other customers faces. My review could of easily been on the downside had I arrived later and still chosen to eat here.   Other than that we made our boarding time just as they called us."}
{"text":"Hostess (curly hair) at 12:50 on June 5th was terrible. She gave our kid a single broken crayon when they are supposed to give them a new 4 pack ( as we saw the next family got when seated ) and didnt inform the wait staff after she sat us. We waited 15 minutes for service while other people that were seated after us got helped. When I saw the hostess I told her I dont think anyone knows we are here and she said \"oh thats my fault I'll let them know\". She must have forgotten again because we waited another ten minutes before someone took our order. Total over 30 minutes before our order was taken. We would have left but we are really hungry."}
{"text":"I had lunch with some good friends from Saulsberry yesterday-I was very impressed with this restaurant as a first timer! The space was welcoming, the service was excellent and our server Lillian was amazing! One of my friends had her burger undercooked -- within a flash she had A brand new burger back on the table cooked to perfection. Lillian's customer service and focus on our experience was superb. Her main focus was making sure that we were happy from start to finish-and she succeeded 300%. I can't wait to grab some friends again and when they ask \"Where do you want to eat? I'm gonna say \"Let's head over to Bad Daddy's!\""}
{"text":"Went to Big Daddy's for a burger and some Trivia on Thursday night.  Great choice!  The location is great, right on East Blvd, and there is some parking lot space if it isn't too packed.  They have a great patio area and the inside is cozy sized.  On Thursday evening they had a few $2 beer specials which was nice.  I had the Frenchie burger, which is a Turkey burger with Brie and apples.  It was phenomenal.  I was hesitant to go with a Turkey burger since there were so many good looking beef options, but my server assured me I would not be disappointed.  I think the Brie really made it with it's buttery rich goodness.  The sweet potato fries were great as well.  Service was pretty good, I would have liked more water refills but other than that very attentive.  We stayed for Trivia, which was supposed to be at 9p but had technical difficulties that resulted in a later start.  Unlike the Ed's Tavern trivia I attended, this game was the real deal.  Cell phone cheaters were threatened with removal from the premises.  The trivia proctor, Kat, was very clear with her questions and the rules.  She had a wagering point system that added some spice to the game - felt like gambling!    Unfortunately we ended up at the bottom of the pack, but I could definitely see myself coming back for more trivia action and an awesome burger!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here!! Great drinks, beer selection and awesome food!!  I love getting the south western salad and the Sam I Am burger.  I have never craved burgers until that burger - it is one of my Favorite meals.  We have also gotten both of their appetizer nachos in the past and they were both really good!! The chili ones are Awesome!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby took me to Birkdale for a spa and lunch date at Bad Daddy's Burger Bar for my birthday last weekend. I loved Bad Daddy's. They were a bit crowded but we posted up at the bar and watched college football. The bartender was attentive. Great grilled chicken sandwich, homemade chips and Castaway cocktails."}
{"text":"Nicely located in Ballantyne, Bid Daddy's serves up some delicious burgers.  In my explorations to date, they are the best place in town for \"gourmet\" burgers.  My personal favorite is the Frenchie (turkey burger with Brie, bacon and green apples).  The sweet potato fries are great as well.  The wait is usually significant due to popularity.  Luckily, there is a large bar and nice outdoor areas where you can wait for a table."}
{"text":"Emilio's chicken sandwich is the bomb!!  Their make-your-own salads are great.  The turkey burger is delicious.  Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I have no earthly clue how I have not reviewed Bad Daddy's yet!!  We came here this past Sunday while my in laws were in town visiting. They have a small parking lot around back with street parking around. I always love sitting outside on the patio, which we did on this particular occasion.  On this occasion, my husband and I split the mushroom burger. For our side, we got a small portion of the asian salad. The burger was fantastic! The truffle aioli on it was killer and made the burger. The dressing on the salad was equally as tasty. My sister in law got tater tots as her side and they were really good!  Good service and great burgers. Excellent combo."}
{"text":"Was just a good burger. French fries were hard and soggy. Staff friendly and kept drinks filled"}
{"text":"Ever have to make a connecting flight in 15 minutes while experiencing a burger craving? Yeah, me too. We'd just zipped through customs and were trying to make our flight back to Philly. I had a burger craving after a week of island cuisine and overall healthy food (minus the alcohol). We stopped at bad daddy's and my boyfriend asked if they could have our food ready in 10 minutes and they delivered it in 9 (yes the cashier advised me). I got the original burger with white cheddar and bacon. It was juicy and delicious although the burger bun was a bit soggy. The fries were forgettable and I did forget them. They were super soggy and tasteless. My boyfriend covered them in bad daddy's sauce and finished them off. He ordered the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. He said it was good but nothing to write home to mom about. He did enjoy his bite of my burger though. We both ordered Oreo shakes and at $7 a piece, they were a fail. Not sure how you can mess up an Oreo Shake but they were a heavy, malty, weird flavor. Overall, for $35+ we could've skipped this spot and eaten at the Golden Arches. Nothing says welcome back to the USA like fast food."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and milk shake. Did the make my own with bacon mayo, American cheese and the tater tots. Ordered the chunky Elvis that was amazing!!! We eat at bad daddy's every time we are in the Carolinas."}
{"text":"No crunch to the fried pickles appetizer?!?!? Hmmmnn I don't get it?  Are these oil soaked pickles appetizer ? Or fried pickles...meaning fried = crunch?  Also the amount of salt in this appetizer is enough to poison an adult?  Please FIX THIS."}
{"text":"My first experience with Bad Daddy's was at their airport location last year. My wife and I shared a quick burger before our flight and I couldn't stop talking about how amazing and juicy it was. Needless to say, I was very excited when I learned a location would be opening up close to us in Birkdale Village.  Well last night we went to their Grand Opening and found the food to be even better than we had remembered.  Our meal started out with the housemade potato chips in pimento cheese that practically melt in your mouth. Their chips are the light and crispy kind like they serve at Ham's. For dinner I ordered the \"Sam I Am\" burger which is a basic burger topped with cheese, a fried egg, rosemary ham, and a delicious bun smothered in pesto. I can't begin to explain the tastes that come together in that combination. At this point that is the best burger I have ever had, and I will be back to enjoy another one in the near future. Unfortunately I am one of those people that will get hooked on one thing and never try anything else on the menu. Luckily my wife tried the Chicken Club Burger and let me have a bite, and I can honestly say it was equally amazing. We finished out the meal with a peanut butter pie for desert and it was HUGE. It's around three pie slices worth, very delicious, and smothered in Ghirardelli chocolate.  Since this place just opened, I can't go into detail on all their other offerings such as weekend breakfasts, mug night, the highly recommended milkshakes, or the beer selection, but if you are looking for a \"Tasty Burger\" that is not easily found in Birkdale you can stop looking because this place is here to stay and we will both be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Ok burger joint. Over priced - don't see what all the hype is about - smash or five guys is better"}
{"text":"Maybe the burger is good here but do not have the chicken burger. Honestly I could not eat it! I liked our server and service . The bun was cold and looked old as if it came direct from a plastic bag. The chicken was so thick I had to cut it and it was tasteless-no flavor . It simply had been fried.  I am giving it one star because. Tried my husbands sweet potato fries and it was nice but also cold. I came here thinking to beat the regular bad airport joints but next time I just go to any of the fast food joints."}
{"text":"I had the fried mozzarella burger which was really good!  The red onion and tomato jam was a good addition.  The servers were hustling around which I respect. No words put of the 5 year old since he was inhaling his slider. I would make a trip to this place again."}
{"text":"Got some nacho dish as an appetizer and it had smoked bacon on it.  Hate smoked food so that wasn't a \"win\" for me.  Fortunately the burger and sweet potatoe fries were delish and filling so I'm full.  Definitely a great burger  joint."}
{"text":"While in  Raleigh  I had the BEST burger. We waited for 30 mins. But it was so worth it. Just found one in Charlotte now to get my burger on!"}
{"text":"Since this is a burger place and that is what they are known for, they should have great burgers, and they definitely deliver on that. They have a lot of different choices to fill any appetite and also have great fries. I would definitely suggest a visit to this place."}
{"text":"(Visit date: 1/2/2018 around 7:30 pm) This was my first visit to a Bad Daddy's and I ordered the Sam I Am burger. It was exactly what I was looking for and really enjoyed it. My reasons  for not rating higher: we ordered four burgers, all \"medium well\" and each burger came out differently, from pink (almost rare) to no pink. Definitely some inconsistency there from the kitchen. Also, I didn't appreciate the optics of a manager (I assume; heavyset male) standing near the kitchen socializing for the duration of our visit. I felt bad for the employees hustling back and forth from the kitchen past the socializing. Regardless, our server was great and I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"The place was packed when we arrived but worth the wait.  I had the Bad Ass Burger and my son had a hamburger.  Both were cooked perfectly and the place has the bun to burger ratio down perfectly.   Some places give you a thin bun that soaks through; others a massive role that won't fit in your mouth.  Bad Daddy's was perfect.    Both burgers were juicy, but not excessively so (that's the worst - hot grease) and both had a great, salty and smokey taste.  Caution: the Bad Ass Burger comes with fried bacon.   It's delicious but eating the burger with the full helping they provide will overwhelm the taste of the actual burger.   Plus, it's A LOT of food.      My appetizer salad came quickly, followed soon thereafter by the burgers.   The servers were all very nice and informed.  The meal was paced nicely.   We sat outside.  Frankly, inside seemed loud.  Great beer selection.     It was a terrific find and sits in a lovely part of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars based on my first visit, but after going back a second time, I was really disappointed.   They have a pretty good drink selection and I ordered the jalapeño beer which is delicious and not spicy at all - it just tastes like jalapeños. We got the nachos as an app and they were pretty good. I ordered the Sam I am burger which has a fried egg and other good stuff on it. I loved it and ordered sweet potato fries as my side which were delicious as well. Everything was great for my first experience here!  The second time I ate here, I decided to build my own burger which was a mistake. They forgot to out the bacon on it and they brought it out separate once I reminded them. It was two pieces of not really well cooked bacon - it was pretty mushy and undercooked but I didn't want to wait longer to eat so I threw it on my burger. I also asked for guacamole at $.75 to be on the burger. It was barely anything. I couldn't even taste it so I just put ketchup on it. I brought this up the waitress and she was indifferent.  I would suggest ordering a burger combo that's already listed on the menu as the one I got made to order sucked."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at this place. My date and I were pretty big fans of Red Robin (which this place reminds me of in alot of ways) so when we stumbled upon it we were happy and hesitant at the same time to see if it would measure up to our expectations. But it did not disappoint,  I've always gotten great service, the menu has a good variety of specialty burgers & sandwiches (if you don't like those you can always make up your own) The sides work well with the mean (accept those onion crisps they look like they belong on a salad but a poor substitute for onion rings my only disappointment) But they usually have great drink specials and even offer up a few deserts that I never have room for because the burgers are quite plentiful. They also have TV's if you want to catch a game and a little out door area as well so it's caters well to all types. I would certainly recommend folks looking for something unique and tasty to head over to the burger bar, it's a safe bet :-D"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! I sent food back for the first time in my life and had it replaced by something else entirely and the new dish was disgusting. They still charged me for it. Way over priced garbage!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here the other night on spur of the moment. I really liked the fact that I could change items on he menu to suit my tastes.  The turkey burger (sans turkey party) with Brie and apples and bacon was amazing and reminded me of a sandwich I had had else where.  Cooked to perfection and the apple was surprisingly cooked but still not mushy.  Was absolutely thrilled to find they had hard cider on tap and for that, I will return many times.  Their shakes are also amazing. Very wonderful meal and definitely worth a second visit."}
{"text":"I guess I don't see what all the fuss is about.  We ate at Big Daddy's on a Friday night with our two kids.  There was a wait, but very reasonable for a Friday night at 7 p.m.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things and the food arrived pretty quickly so no issues there really.    Maybe our expectations were too high, but we weren't bowled over by the food.  We had the homemade potato chips for an ap and they were tasty.  Nothing special, but nothing wrong with them either.  I love homemade chips but these didn't wow me.   Hubs ordered the Bacon Burger on Steriods.  I think we were both envisioning heart attack on a platter (in the best possible way of course!).  Unfortunately we were disappointed.  A rather smallish burger arrived  - for $11 and with that name we were expecting something huge!  You couldn't even see the bacon unless you lifted the bun.  Chili's is serving a better bacon burger right now - larger and tastier with better bacon.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad burger, but did not meet expectations.  I went with a small salad from the Make Your Own Section.  Nice option really.  Kind of like a salad bar without having to worry about the food coming into contact with every one in the place.  Good choice of toppings.  Very reasonable price.  For various sides we had the fries and the sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries were good, regular fries were not great.  They kind of had a weird taste.  My fry loving 7 yr old wouldn't eat them.   A first.  All in all, I think there are better places for a burger in Charlotte - 131 Main, Five Guys - even Chili's come to mind."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Charlotte. Lots of options! Their Cantina black bean burger rivals a meat burger any day. They have great specials on drinks most weeknights and an outdoor patio that's heated when it's cold. The parking isn't the most convenient, but not too bad for a shopping center. There are always spots, they may just be further away. Consistently good service and excellent food."}
{"text":"I was initially back and forth about going, Man was I happy I did!  I had the Southern Burger that was an explosion of flavors in my mouth.  The service and atmosphere were great.  I was stuffed and happy especially when I saw the check!  I'm heading back there before I go home."}
{"text":"Western burger, sweet potato fries, and good beers on tap. Very fast, friendly service and tasty food. Will definitely come by again if I'm in CLT."}
{"text":"This family oriented eating spot boasts an industrial feel but includes TVs and a patio to cater to all clientele. Dora here. I think Ernie just got all excited about the diamond plate wainscoting. Reminded him of a fire truck. :) Seriously, folks, Bad Daddy's attracted all ages, and is in a walkable, bikable neighborhood. Be warned though. Parking is tight, and by Saturday at noon, people were lined up outside, waiting to get in.  We started with the Fried Pickles appetizer. These dill pickles were very good; sliced lengthways, fried very crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The only thing that would have made these better would be a little less salt. Dora here. Anybody else getting tired of seeing fried pickles on here? Note to Ernie: next time go with a different appetizer!   I chose the Classic Southern Burger, a basic burger topped with chili, American cheese, relish, mustard and slaw and served on a Brioche bun. Basically a Carolina burger except swap the onions with relish. This burger was huge, sloppy and had to be eaten with a fork. The flavors were outstanding and the chili actually had beans. Tater tots were crispy and had an excellent taste. Dora here. There was nothing basic about that burger.  My wife had the Frenchie which is a turkey burger with brie, applewood bacon, grilled apples and garlic mayo served on a Brioche bun. Dora here. I was torn on this one because I really was leaning toward the Mama Ricotta's Burger, just to try it. Doesn't that sound intriguing? Anyway, the Frenchie with the grilled apples won. The bun was soft and fresh, as if they baked it on site, and the cheese literally oozed from the sandwich. Good thing the tables sport a roll of paper towels because you'll need 'em. But, let me tell you, the jalapeno honey mustard and bad daddy sauces on the side were ah-mazing! They jazzed this yummy turkey burger to awesome, but too much of a good thing might leave your tongue on fire.  And get a grip! Check out the size of this burger!  I would rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 forks for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.  Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Chicken nachos...light & fruity! Refreshing change from heavier chili version. Delish!  Bacon cheeseburger on steroids. Not for wimps. My mouth's on fire!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but we didn't feel quite welcomed. My wife had to send her burger back as it wasn't done and while the manager was pleasant about it, other staff had this demeanor of \"how dare she\". We also felt rushed to leave while everyone else appeared to be having a wonderful time enjoying themselves and not being rushed at all. IDK it was something about us I guess. We're a pretty laid back family so I wouldn't know what it was that rubbed them the wrong way. We weren't rude about the burger, we weren't upset at all just wanted a well done burger so there was no disgruntled on our part. Would I go back? I mean maybe there's a very slight chance who knows. I did like the fact that they had 2 teenagers working as hosts. Always nice to see teenagers learning the importance of hard work."}
{"text":"This place is good the burgers are fresh and they have an extensive build your own model. Lots of things to love about the food.  The location is rough though and thats why the missing star -- parking is a Joke and there is often a wait. These negatives don't seem to deter the crowds."}
{"text":"Just had the best bean burger ever!!! Had a little kick to it and I loved it. I'll take a layover in Charlotte any day now!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Big Daddy's with a carnivorous friend last year. I crossed my finger's for a vegetarian option and got lucky!   I ordered the portabella mushroom burger, which was battered and fried. I was totally impressed with how delicious and unique this sandwich was! However, I'm looking at the online menu and don't see it listed, please say it ain't so...  The sweet potato fries were super yummy, I ate every last one of them!   I wasn't the biggest fan of the atmosphere here, but that's because sports bars aren't my thing and that's totally what this place is.   Will definitely come back, probably just on a weekday when Big Daddy's isn't so loud and busy."}
{"text":"I had never been to Bad Daddy's but I always heard great things about it. My husband and I went on a Tuesday night and we were immediately seated. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night but that is totally fine with us. The hostess was not excited about being there but our waitress was super nice. We ordered the house chips and the queso for our appetizers. We then ordered customized burgers and we were super impressed. The burgers were big and juicy. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, really good burger. Congrats to whoever manages it on an extremely diverse staff that is also super cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"My roommates took me here on my first night in Charlotte. I'm from Toronto and we have nothing as good as delicious as the burgers here! I've since gone back 5 times within a month. I usually get the Emilio's Chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries - both heavenly! Their milkshakes are yummy too. Love everything about this joint."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat!  I looooove veggie burgers and salads and they have the best. I am one of those people who never finishes their food but here is one of the few place I will. There salad choices are always fresh and taste amazing. I always build my own and they have a lot of ingredient choices. I don't know how to explain how much I love their black bean hand crafted burger, it is just amazing add avocado and it just cant get any better. They have a great staff that are very accommodating. My sister wanted cheese on her tater tots, which they don't offer, but the waiter put cheese on her and melted it. The drinks are always perfectly chilled and the milk shakes are great.  It's a relaxed atmosphere with a casual crowd. This place is a must try for me."}
{"text":"Really good burger and great service.  Will return with a bigger apatite, the 10 Oz burger was too much"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's Burgers is still a very good place to visit for lunch.  I have not gone for dinner because it seems to be just a little too casual for dinner downtown.  However the food is great.  I have been a few times and each time I have tried different burgers.  The most recent visit I had the turkey burger, with tater tots.  My lunch partner had sweet potato fries and a black bean burger.  The burgers have gotten a little smaller...or you get more bun!  Hard to figure out.  But the flavors are amazing!   The sweet potato fries and the tater tots both came with their own dipping sauces.  Both would be great without the sauce...and I could snack on them for days! My next visit....and I will go back....will be after hours or on a weekend lunch to see just how great the burgers are with \"chilled\" 12 ounce beverages!!!  So...Big Daddy...ooops... Bad Daddy...thanks for keeping the menu items and great flavors even though I still have challenges with the name!  I cannot wait to get back there again...and will definitely have a better park and walk strategy in case the lot is full!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but not necessarily my first choice. No complaints but not off the charts. I wouldn't put it in the top 20 nationwide like you frequently see."}
{"text":"This place was just flat out bad, and that's too bad because the other locations are really good.  The one star here is for the fact that they had Sam Adams on tap.  I asked for my burger medium rare.  They burnt it on the outside and the inside was medium.  My daughter order a burger on Texas toast.  The toast was burnt, her tater tots were a cold greasy mess and the burger was cold too.  My wife got a salad with chicken.  The chicken was cold and best of all, I'm guessing the waitress must have thought my wife's hands were a fork and knife cause we had to flag down 2 waitresses to bring us silverware.  Like I said, outside of the Sam Adams, the meal was awful.  They really do a dis-service to the other locations.  There have to be better options at CLT for food.  I would avoid this place unless you just want a beer."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite airport dining spot in the USAirways system, and my number two or three in any airport I travel to.  Pros:  Quick service.  Amazing veggie burger (it's the Cantina Burger).  Countless topping options to customize your burger.  Piping hot and perfectly crispy tater tots.  Ice cold PBR tallboys.  Cons:  Uh, they're always busy?"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour & check out Big Daddy's for Sunday brunch.  Yes, go to a burger joint for brunch.  They have the best omelets around.  It's just like their burgers - build your own."}
{"text":"Great burgers!!! Actually cooked to order, which is becoming harder to find these days.  Will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"Best burger place in town for sure.  I love some of their recent menu changes.  You've got to check out the jalapeño bacon and the bacon aioli.  Always fast and friendly service and any menu item will be a great choice.  Don't forget to try an adult milkshake!"}
{"text":"Buffalo burger with swiss and bacon was as good as its gets. Sweet potato fries were delicious as hell....Way better than nearby Red Robin."}
{"text":"Love the selection here. Tons of amazing options. The crispy chicken sandwich is super good, ask for them to go easy on the blue cheese! Great family friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for a delicious burger!  I love the burger with Swiss cheese on rye!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great bacon cheeseburger that I couldn't finish! The homemade onion rings were great! So much better than what other restaurants offer.Excellent service!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the best burger Ive ever eaten here.  It was the Magic Mushroom Burger. I didn't add a thing, which is unusual for me. The service was superb and I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Bad Daddy's in South Charlotte and Huntersville so I was excited to see one opening five minutes from my house.  My parents had never been before we went tonight and I promised them they would love it. The resturant didn't disappoint but we did notice hiccups we're assuming were there because of it being new.  The menu had a lot of options and build your own burgers or salads.  We had a free appetizer coupon and had the bacon queso dip which was good but on the salty side. Overall it was good flavor and constancy. My parents both got burgers and both came out looking good. While ordering our server missed taking the temperatures they wanted for their burgers but she did come back and ask. My mom had requested no tomatoes on her burger but one bite showed tomatoes. Not sure if it was a mess up on the server or kitchen's part but our server didn't really acknowledge or offer to fix the problem when we brought it up to her. I built my own salad with a black bean burger which was super crispy. I love crispy food but I do see some people see it as close to burnt. We all polished off our food despite a few issues.  One thing I noticed about the burgers was at other locations the lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle were served on the side for the customer to build. At this location it was served on the burger. Slight constancy issue but nothing major.  We all agreed that we would go back. None of the issues were too big of a problem and im sure this will be a successful resturant."}
{"text":"I ordered my food over an hour ago, still no word on its progress. As I write this, I've given up and just paid for my drink.  Thank you big Daddy's for completely wasting my time. (It's not like I'm trying to catch a flight or anything)"}
{"text":"Great Burgers, tater tots and atmosphere! It's definitely one of my favorite Burger joints in Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"My experience was excellent for a hotel restaurant, this place is good, not as good as the real deal Bad Daddy's Burger Bar that is not at airport. That being said, this place does warrant four stars for good food, accommodating me with special requests, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Yummy food and Ashley rocks! Funny, witty and awesome service! Burgers and Champagne!!! Just what a group of girls needs at the airport!"}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport bar and grill...my patty melt was good and they had a nice variety of IPAs on tap.....seriously what can you really expect from an airport"}
{"text":"Not sure on the rave at this place. I normally don't post bad experiences but feel like this is the time.  First, Health Rating was a 90. That's a B, and I know why. Employees sitting at the bar, then just walk to the kitchen area.  Employees in the kitchen area on phones then handling food. Bathroom was awful and reeked of bad smells. Parking lot was filthy as well. No dress code for employees.  Obviously you can wear whatever is dirty. I'm just disappointed because I was here when this restaurant first opened and was owned by a renowned restraunteer in Charlotte. Times have changed. Beer was not and no way was I eating after having a clear view of the kitchen. I hope this review helps the owners realize you have to make a change."}
{"text":"Best black bean burger I've ever had, and great beer selection.  Staff was super friendly!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a funky, on the run kind of place for bar food.  But the sweet potato fries were great, and the black bean burger - though small - was very tasty with a moist texture.  The bloody Mary was a steep $13.95, but when requested to be \"spicy\" - wooHoo - it could have arrived with a fireman's escort.  Loved it.  The tables are close enough to each other that no one is a stranger.  Frankly, that's a good thing too.  Say hello to somebody once in a while, y'all.  It can warm your soul as easily as a Bloody Mary can stoke your insides."}
{"text":"Our bartender was super friendly and full of suggestions. I'll let you in on a secret..the truffle aioli is where it's at! Thanks guys, you were great!"}
{"text":"First off, every cocktail I've ever gotten here has been cheap, delicious, and strong. These bartenders are great. My favorite spot for drinks!  The food is delicious, and I LOVE the build your own salad and burger options. this is a great burger joint, great food and great, quick service"}
{"text":"There are a few things you should know before reading this review: 1. My family is fanatical about milkshakes. 2. My brother lives in Charlotte. And 3. Because of the aforementioned, during a recent family visit, he took us to Bad Daddy's for lunch.  So the most important thing to take away from this review? The milkshake was excellent. I had Cookies and Cream (or \"Oreo,\" if you prefer) and even without whipped cream and a cherry, it knocked my socks off.  They also offer \"adult\" milkshakes, all of which sounded wonderful. Being a family affair on a Saturday afternoon I did not partake, and so I cannot fully attest to their awesomeness, but how can you really go wrong with alcohol AND a milkshake??   My boyfriend and I split the Cantina Burger (black bean burger with green chiles, avocado and cheese) and the Western Burger (bison burger, Monterey Jack, fried onions and BBQ), and both were excellent. Likewise, we split the sweet potato fries and the fried onions - again, both excellent. Furthermore, my family split an appetizer of fried pickles (yum), and I stole some of my Dad's Truffle Parmesan fries (super yum).    AND! You can make your own burger or your own salad. There were so many delicious options on the menu that I didn't do this, although I love to \"build my own\" so it was hard to pass up.   It was expensive - my Dad didn't have an entree, only two of us had a soda and we split a few of the milkshakes, and the bill was still $100 plus for 6 people. Ok, so now that I'm doing the math that's +/-$16 per person, so it's not outrageous. Oh, and the wait staff were excellent. Accommodating, pleasant, efficient.  It was a late lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was not overly crowded - a little loud inside, but we ate outside and it was very pleasant. Ultimately, I would love to go back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Service has improved since opening!  Thank you!  I tried the new Philly sandwich and would not order again.  It was wrapped in foil type paper so  the soggy, messy, not to mention small in appearance.  It tasted fine, but was messy."}
{"text":"My family and I were very disappointed. First I was surprised at how dirty everything was. We sat right in front of the kitchen and service area. The service area/bus station should not be exposed. If it is exposed it should be kept clean. Floors were dirty, bathroom was dirty, bar area was sloppy. Food and drinks took very long. No one checked on us so I had to get up find my waitress to check on our food and drinks. She was nice enough but seemed lost. There was not a manager presence. A manager should have been present to catch all these service issues and i'm suprised at the lack of cleanliness of the place. The two stars are for the food which was decent."}
{"text":"Greatest burger place I have Been to with the best milkshakes I love their tatter tots and fries and their onion straws are also great for a appetizer!"}
{"text":"Fun, casual, genuinely kind staff, spot-on food flavors, large side portions, worth the $.  Great lighting/window light/music atmosphere. Server did his job above and beyond. Checked in right after our food came out, then every 2-3 min after. Super sweet.  Had a visit from another person who seemed to be the manager, said hello to us and asked about our dinner.  Would LOVE to come back and try their giant salads."}
{"text":"If you like burgers, this is the place for you! I like a good burger but am not one for having cravings for burgers. After reading the menu, I was practically salivating all over the place!  They have an amazing menu and you can substitute veggie, black bean, buffalo burgers instead of the regular beef and I finally settled on the Cantina 1511 Burger--a black bean burger topped with green chiles, avocado, Monterrey and Cheddar Cheese with a Chipotle Ranch. You can also substitute a salad as your side for only $2 more and you can create a side salad--how awesome is that? I got a side salad with baby spinach, red peppers, feta, strawberries, jalapenos and walnuts with Balsamic vinaigrette.   I was raving about this to a co-worker and she mentioned they have \"adult\" shakes with alcohol.....say what? Sold. I will definitely be going back here--but will be working out earlier so I can indulge again."}
{"text":"Great massive burgers. Tots are always fresh!  About 10-12 a burger + side after you choose your toppings!"}
{"text":"Pretty packed on a Saturday night.  We were greeted fast.  The hostess was friendly. She did advise us of a wait.  Food was great and quick.  One thing I would ask manager to think about are warmers for the outside.  This location doesn't have a great size area to wait.  I was distrusted to see a lady with her newborn outside waiting to be seated when we arrived.  It was cool outside..."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I like the drink specials, the sweet potato fries and I LOVE the customizability of the burgers, even though I will probably never make use of some of the items on the menu (ie blue cheese, anything with horseradish, or the chicken patties).  I like the classic rock feel of the place and the heated patio.  The wait is a pain sometimes, and the hostesses WILL underestimate the wait time, which is for me a negative.  If it's gonna be an hour wait, I want you to tell it to me straight and not avert your eyes and mumble something about 30 minutes.  But if you want a juicy burger and you really want it your way - fried egg, baconnaise, tater tots and all - Big Daddy's is your spot."}
{"text":"I don't give out a lot of fives , but the manager went out of his way to make our meal great . I ordered there special Asian burger and isn't realize the slaw had coconut so it didn't sit well with me I never return my food but I was hungry and after a bite I new it wasn't for me , they were totally cool about it and got me whatever I wanted the manager made sure it was done fast and just what I wanted . I got a plain cheese burger and it was delish .  I highly recommend , and greatfull for good service ."}
{"text":"I seriously loved my first Bad Daddy's experience. We went on Sunday night of 4th of July weekend and got seated after a 5ish minute wait. I imagine the wait gets pretty long on a weekend night. They have a text system so you don't have to wait in the vicinity if you have a long wait.  Their waiters are chipper and help you through the menu. I got the one and only veggie burger as is and it was delicious. It came with some chipotle sauce that was one of the best I've ever had. I made my own side salad which was forgettable, but the sweet potato fries were the best I've had in Charlotte so far. Perfect crispiness. The veggie burger itself was hearty and flavorful. Next time we'll definitely stick around for the boozy milkshakes. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had a awesome Bacon Cheeseburger.  Now if you order a Bacon Cheeseburger there are certain expectations.  The first is BACON.  Wow did this burger deliver.  Most burgers give you a piece or two, not Bad Daddy's.  It was loaded with 2 kinds of bacon and plenty of it.  I loved the jalepeno bacon by the way.  The burger was moist and cooked to perfections.  I had the onion straws and they were a great change from the traditional french fries.  I can't wait to go back again.  Luck for me it's here in Charlotte and I travel here often for business.  Ya'll have to try this place!  Thanks Brian for recommending this place."}
{"text":"ALWAYS good!  I have eaten here 7 or 8 times since they opened in Birkdale and it's been excellent every single time.  The Burgers are always perfectly cooked, the toppings are perfect, the fries (especially the sweet potato fries) are awesome and the salads are my favorite.   It's not often you go to a burger restaurant and debate on whether you want a burger or salad but they are both VERY good. Also you must try their breakfast.  The omelets are so good and the breakfast burrito is a favorite of my whole family.   The survivors are so friendly and very knowledgeable, Lucas is one who stands out. So glad they opened their second restaurant 5 miles from us. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't even know where to begin! I came to Bad Daddy's in a Tuesday afternoon, where it wasn't too busy. This was the second time at this location, probably the sixth time to a Bad Daddy's overall, but the first time I've left a review! Each and every time, I've had an excellent meal and excellent service; however, this experience was so good, I had to mention it!  I came with my boyfriend. I got the BD's All American Burger with fries, and he got the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with cole slaw. My burger was delicious, cooked just as I asked, and the fries were fantastic! I didn't like them as much as the chips, but definitely still a wonderful choice. Our waitress also gave me a cup of spicy garlic ketchup after I inquired about it, as well as a cup of Bad Daddy's sauce. Both of these were OUTSTANDING! I will most definitely be putting Bad Daddy's sauce on my burger next time! My boyfriend loved his burger! He's not a fan of sweet cole slaw, but it still wasn't bad. I would definitely recommend getting the chips, because those are to die for!   For dessert, we decided to split the Chunky Elvis Shake. I was fairly trepidatious at first (as the $5.50 price tag seemed a little high for a milkshake), but when she brought it out, I saw why! This milkshake was gigantic, and she was even kind enough to bring out the extra bit that wouldn't fit in the glass! This shake has peanut butter, banana, Ghirardelli chocolate sauce, and walnuts. I love peanut butter, but I get pretty picky when banana and nuts are involved (some places overdo the banana flavor), but this milkshake was outstanding! I am so glad we split one, because I would never be able to drink a whole one.   Kerri was our waitress, and she was WONDERFUL! Super sweet, incredibly empathetic, she was overall an amazing server. I would come back 100% for just her, if the food was subpar; but luckily, the food was amazing! She asked all the right questions, was quick and effective with our food, and checked in multiple times! She made great recommendations, and walked us through all of the answers to our questions. When I asked her about the option to add peanut butter in the \"build your own burger\" section, she told us a great story about orders that included peanut butter in the past! She was very unique, had a great sense of humor!  All in all, the picture I attached that's on the wall sums up my experience very well!"}
{"text":"I visited Bad Daddys  with coworkers and tried the Chicken club burger. It was really good. All of my co-workers stated they enjoyed their meals. We finished the meal with milkshakes. I had the cookies and cream. It was also terrific. The prices were reasonable and they place was busy. I will definitely return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"We went to Bad Daddy's on Saturday evening with our pup after a hike in the mountains.  This place is 5 stars for dog friendliness!  They were welcoming to our dog and others with their dogs at their patio seating!  Our waiter was very friendly with our dog and even poured water in the bowl we brought when he noticed our dog wasn't drinking out of their bowl.  Our picky dog!  Sure enough he drank away.  How attentive!  Anyways, onto the food - my aunt and hubs had the build your own burger and both liked theirs.  I got the buffalo burger (substituted the buffalo chicken with burger!).  I also substituted the blue cheese with mozzarella - what a great substitute!  The burger was juicy and flavorful, but I will say it lacked the buffalo flavor.  The buffalo sauce was on the burger, but you really couldn't tell taste wise - more needs to be cooked into it or on it.  The fries were good as well, I had the regular and hubs had the sweet potato.  Good food, great service, and good time with the pup.  We will be back!  Sorry yelpers - I forgot to get photos, I was hungry after our hike and dove right in!  Next time :)"}
{"text":"If you're craving a burger go here. It's so good. Bison burger amazing...Always cooked to perfection and always juicy and delicious. The sweet pot fries and tots are also very good. It's not cheap but everything that I have had here is good."}
{"text":"It will do if needed. The chili was pretty good, tasted a little processed, but for airport food, it will suffice in a hurry. The sliders were not yummy. We went to Bad Daddy's after getting chicken tenders that were not fully cooked at another restaurant seconds away in Gate C,.  The floor was a little slippery which was odd because it looked liked it was an anti slip surface. I told the hostess and she said a cleaning crew was coming tonight or tomorrow because they had an incident yesterday or the day before. I'd pick this last, but it will do in a hurry."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times with my family and its always a fun place, other than the wait and parking. I would say come hungry as the portions are huge.   I've gotten the turkey burger (since I try not to eat much beef) and sweet potato fries a few times.  The fries are awesome.  The turkey burger itself tastes very good, but the mixture is a little heavy on bread/fillers. The results is that its more like a turkey-loaf patty rather than a meat patty."}
{"text":"Awesome sweet potato fries! I also like the build your own salads!  For the amount you spend and for the portions, is not that great!"}
{"text":"I must admit, when I realized Bad Daddy's was a small chain, I became less excited to try it. Call me a snob if you want, but I tend to gravitate towards places that have only one or two locations.   When it comes to Bad Daddy's you needn't have the same worry. The quality was great!   My favorite part was the ability to create your own burger. The process was made very easy by the card you can fill out with your specifications. For my burger, I chose the beef patty, cooked medium rare, on Texas Toast. For toppings I selected Peanut Butter (don't knock it until you try it) and Onion Straws. If you have read my other burger reviews, you know that the way a burger is cooked is everything! Luckily for Bad Daddy's, my burger was cooked perfectly. They were also generous on the toppings! I had onion straws falling off the burger as I bit into it.   For my side, I got tater tots. These are hard to mess up and a great go to. They were served with Bad Daddy's sauce which was a bit smokey and spicey and quite good. Next time, I think I will try their chips."}
{"text":"Our family of four with a one-year old made our first visit to this newly opened restaurant. We arrived at 1700 and were seated immediately. Folks who arrived after 1730 appeared to have a wait.  The venue was a typical sports bar arrangement with a variety of seating possibilities and numerous televisions.   The restaurant is kid-friendly.  Several other families had small children as well.  Our waitress, Besh, was attentive to our needs and kept our drinks refilled without our having to ask.  We enjoyed fried pickles with sauces as an appetizer.  I had the bacon cheeseburger on steroids (pictured) and homemade chips. My wife and grandson-in-law did the \"create your own\" burger (menu). My granddaughter had the magic mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. Charlie, the baby, enjoyed with gusto a grilled cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The portions were generous, and the food was tasty. No one had any complaints."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I love this place! :) I usually get the frenchie and I'm never disappointed but I decided to try the cantina black bean burger and I was even more thrown off my feet than before. The burger had so much flavor and paired well with the sweet potato fries. My waitress was attentive and really personable. I hate I can't remember her name. Anyway, I have a new favorite burger now!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go. Good bar food. Ordered big ass burger. Huge. For the big eater. Overall food good. Quesadillas good as well as burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet burgers. I've had the western burger and southern burger.  The southern with sweet potato fries is the best burger dish I've had to date. You gotta try this."}
{"text":"Indoor and outdoor seating. Great burger joint. Not your avg one though. the burgers all have their own style to them. The place is small and always packed though."}
{"text":"Love the burgers, make your own salad with fresh mozzarella and the amazing sweet potato fries with the Chipotle ranch dipping sauce.  Make sure you ask for this sauce!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Charlotte area for work with some new hires.  We stopped here for lunch based on the positive yelp reviews.  We all got salads.... ...but my salad was a burger. A GIANT burger. I could feel my heart rate slowing just by looking at it. Best burger I've ever had. I can't keep my eyes open, and that's how you know it's good.  Visit this American Treasure if you knows what's good for you."}
{"text":"I just ordered an unbelievable cheeseburger and fries! The staff is super friendly and the food is off-the-charts delicious!"}
{"text":"Great burger! Exceeded my expectations for a restaurant at the airport. Made to order. I got fried onions, bacon, mayo, ketchup, lettuce and tomato. Yummy! Plus the fries were great. Waiter was very polite and attentive. Surprising because the place was packed."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Bad Daddy's and we'll be back for sure. We visited one weekday afternoon about 3:30PM. The Southern burger (Chili, Slaw, Mustard) was delicious and cooked to perfection (MW). I liked the tots too. My wife had a salad and she enjoyed picking out her own ingredients. The service was excellent and our server was very familiar with the menu and made some suggestions."}
{"text":"We love going to Bad Daddy's (formerly Big Daddy's).  It's a great, \"fancy\" burger place.  I also enjoy the Mama Ricotta's burger (huge cut of mozz cheese and thick tomato on top of the burger).  The Sam I Am burger is also fantastic.    I am not a fan of the sweet potato fries here, but many in my group tend to like them.  The \"make your own salad\" always seems to win with the ladies, and it is about as customizable as you could possibly make it.  The place can get very crowded during rush hour, so we almost always try to be very early or very late so we don't have to wait as long.    The place is also pretty kid friendly, as the atmosphere is always loud and noisy anyways.  It is a bit cramped though, so don't bring all your baby gear with you!"}
{"text":"When down at Charlotte I decided to visit bad daddy's based on its yelp review. I'm very happy I did. When we walked in we were greeted very warmly and promptly seated. Since we were new we got a  run down of the menu. I settled on a create your own hamburger and fries. The hamburger was excellent as was the horseradish mayo I had put on. What really made it great was the over easy egg I ordered with it. The meat was well seasoned and expertly cooked. The fries next to the hamburger were freshly cut and fried. Excellent as well  We finished with a desert from across the street at the chocolate and ice cream parlor.  All in all I would definitely come back every time I'm in town"}
{"text":"I went as part of my company lunch. This is my first experience in this joint.  Location: Very close proximity to corporate parks Ambience: So welcoming with some rustic tin style lining the wall with open ceiling without any false roofing. I loved it Food: Great portion and fantastic taste.  My overall experience was great and I loved the taste of my burger and you'd feel full after having a single burger. One thing the business can improve is the speed of service. But I did not mind the wait after tasting their burgers. I guess good things come to those who wait!  Overall! Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"What a great-tasting, relaxing lunch we had.  Because they're so busy on warm, sunny days, we had to wait 20 minutes for a table outside, but it was worth it.    The restaurant is definitely one of the best burger choices in town.  Big Daddy's has a variety of burgers to choose from, but if you don't find any that appeal to your taste buds, you can create your own.  I went with the Frenchie.  No, not the American Idol chick.  It's so-named because of the Brie cheese it contains, along with turkey burger, bacon, apples, and garlic mayo.  You could say it's almost healthy.  But who cares?  It tasted delicious!!  The only thing I'd recommend is asking for the mayo on the side.  The sandwich was so moist/wet that it kept falling apart.     Big Daddy's also has a buttload of sides you can choose from, so you don't have to stick with fries (although they are good, too!).  I opted for the upgrade to a small salad.  For $2 extra, it was worth it.  I got to pick all the toppings I wanted and it tasted oh-so-good on a hot day.  Every bite was full of flavors that I love...because I got to pick all the toppings!  And there are a LOT of them to choose from.  As a side note, we tried the Duck Fries appetizer once and, yes, we had to ask what they were.  They're apparently regular French fries that have been fried in duck fat.  They only serve these on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, though.  I didn't notice much of a difference in taste, you get a very small amount, and it's probably not very healthy for you.  So, for all those reasons and the fact that they're $6 an order, I'd say skip the duck fries and try a different appetizer."}
{"text":"Waiting on line and hostess did not acknowledge me, stood in front of podium for 5 minutes. 2 hostesses and 1 other employee and still did not get greeted. This place has the worst customer service. I think maybe the food is good but I don't know.  I walked away since I didn't want to make the hostesses do their job and actually greet and seat customers"}
{"text":"OMG. I had the bacon cheeseburger on steroids. It lives up its name. Two types of bacon: applewood and JALAPEÑO. And the most delicious \"Bad Daddy\" sauce!!  I would have bought a bottle of they sold them. My waitress was fun and said to take my time since I had a layover. The fries are awesome as well. Check it out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times and while the food is always decent it just never is a very comfortable experience. They carry a good selection of specialty burgers and the beer specials will usually run around 3-4$. With the raging trend of burger bars/restaurants over the past few years this one is probably mid range at best. One of the things that always bugs me about this particular location is that parking is just about non-existent. They have a small lot and most patrons have to resort and walk it a couple blocks to get in during their rush hours. Once you are inside, the actual space they have is pretty cramped. It feels like you are always elbow to elbow with whoever is sitting next to you even if they aren't at your table or booth. That makes it hard on the servers to dance around and fill everyone's orders, although, they do manage well. The last thing that I'd say that \"grinds my gears\" about this spot is the noise level. With it drawing in a lot of the local families in the area it seems like there is usually more noise than most sit down places deserve. The concrete floors and large glass windows kinda of box all that noise in and you have to raise your voice to have a conversation with people at you table. I guess I'd recommend this place for take out if you are in the area and really wanted a burger but for a nice sit-down lunch or dinner it's just not comfortable."}
{"text":"Great burger, definitely something you cannot eat weekly or you will be dead. The place can get quite loud and its always packed to the gills much like any place in this area of Charlotte.  I have come to the conclusion, that you can open anything with wine and beer and semi decent food in my area and you will do well. Also don't expect cheap."}
{"text":"My first experience at Bad daddy's was amazing! Killer food, cool atmosphere.   We sat outside on the patio. Best part of our visit was our server Baileigh, she was on point! true customer service skills, super friendly and pleasant. Great menu knowledge.   She suggested us a few things. My husband had the \"bad ass burger\" with fries, and I ordered the \"daddy's philly\" with no jalapeños and for my side, sweet potatoes. I can't explain with words how was it, and the sauces that comes with it. O-M-G! Big, juicy, burgers that comes anyway you can imagine, because you can create your own! Any combination available.   Of course, definitely be back and trying different items from the menu.  We took leftovers and additional sauces that Bailegh package for us.   Hands down!"}
{"text":"This a good go to when you need a burger and everyone can get their favorite type. I like the tuna burger--build your own is better and about the same price as the listed one on the menu. I enjoy it with wasabi mayo & avocado. Sweet fries are my fave side but I also try the side salad when wanting veggies. Good NC beers too!"}
{"text":"Pretty crowded place....burger was alright.....service was alright. Nothing special, really"}
{"text":"We went here on a team lunch. I got the Fried Mozarella burger and fries. It wasn't bad, but after biting into it, I wish I had gotten the Sam I Am or the Pittsburgher instead.  I was surprised that the hamburger itself wasn't seasoned, or if it was, it was very light seasoning. I was expecting a hamburger that stood out aside from the toppings and extras; unfortunately, it was bland. The fries were somewhat limp, but I prefer them that way; if you're into crispy fries, though, I'd warn you against them.  All in all, it wasn't bad. I do wish I had ordered a different type of burger, though. The toppings on the Fried Mozarella burger just didn't work well together. Again, it wasn't bad, they just didn't blend well.  My problem is the price. I expected a burger that would knock my socks off at that price. What I got was a burger that was reasonably good. With fries that I thought were better than a lot of places. But I wouldn't go back and pay my own money (the lunch was paid for by my company) for a burger. If they were maybe $3-4 cheaper, I'd be tempted to come back a second time. But as is, I can get a tastier hamburger that is much less expensive at other restaurants.  I will say the service was consistently wonderful, the food arrived relatively fast, and I like the decore.  I would like to end this by saying that, while I gave this a solid three stars, if the price were somewhat lower and/or I liked burgers more, I might give this four stars. So take that into account if you're someone that really enjoys burgers with creative toppings and don't mind paying extra for them."}
{"text":"This is your average burger bar in an airport.  It was packed which I suspect is always the case in the busy Charlotte airport.  We were lucky to get a seat at the bar.  The bartender was great and they had a few good beers on tap. I went with a Blue Moon with an orange.  The menu is mostly burgers but they do have salads, appetizers and a few other sandwiches. I went with a burger with cheese and all the fixings and a side salad with blue cheese dressing instead of fries. Of course there is an up charge for this which I hate but a great healthy alternative.  The burger was decent and the salad was pretty good-at first they told me they were out of blue cheese and had ranch. That was fine but then they were out of ranch and had blue cheese. Again the place is always busy so I am glad they got our orders right.  They also have tator tots instead of regular fries which is a nice option.  The food was served in an average amount of time so keep that into consideration if you are looking for something quick before a flight."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food and drinks. Salad and burgers excellent. Very noisy so don't expect cozy, just awesome food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Layover. Looking for a hot breakfast.   I was impressed by the variety on the breakfast menu, for an airport joint. I ordered some kind of scramble with mushrooms and sausage in it, with a side of thick-cut bacon. I also tried to order hot chocolate, but only some coffee was available. They didn't even offer tea. I got the coffee anyways... it was decidedly gross. (It's not that I don't drink coffee, just wasn't in the mood, but I was freezing.)  The breakfast portion was huge, but I really didn't eat most of it. Everything was cold, which was a bit confusing because it came out so fast. The scramble was watery. The toast was not toast at all... just bread. Not warm, not crisp. The potatoes were pretty dry. Bacon was reasonably delish, though.  Still, I guess for a \"sit-down\" breakfast in the Charlotte Airport without having to go out of my way, I'm fairly grateful for Bad Daddy's existence. Just wish it would've been hot.   Service was good, though. Attentive, smiley. Energetic.   It coulda been worse, but I've definitely experienced better-- even in airports."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Consistently great food and a nice open atmosphere. Daddy's Nachos are the best nachos I've ever had and the portion is huge. Me and my boyfriend always get them and we are almost full before our entrees come out, but they are so hard to stop eating!  I normally build my own burger, but today I got the Sam I Am burger and it was hands down the best burger I've ever had! So delicious. And you have to get the tater tots too!"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of places I get excited about a salad. But the salads here are actually amazing! Highly recommend the smokehouse burger. Will definitely be coming back to try all of them."}
{"text":"We were so excited to hear of the new Bad Daddy's location opening up close to our house and enjoyed our first visit. Went for lunch and got in right before the big lunch crowd. Bad ass burger in a lettuce wrap was amazing. Sad that my fries were stone cold though. With it being so busy I didn't feel like waiting a while to reorder.  Overall looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Best burger Best burger I've ever had in a restaurant  Best burger EVER Best mushroom, sautéed onions and cheese burger Best sweet potato fries Best juicy burger  Best finger licking burger Best OMG burger Best first bite can't believe this burger is really this good          burger!! Best wow Best BURGER!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night at 8:30. Restaurant had a light crowd.  Was seated immediately at a booth of my choice. Waitstaff was pretty good; not too often, not too seldom. Drink refills, extra napkins(!), etcetera.  Had a custom-built burger with bleu cheese, cooked medium. Good job! Liked the Big Daddy's sauce for my fries--bbq sauce, mayo, and other ingredients."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. I would not order a patty melt in the future as came out cold and not very appetizing. They were swamped and the waiter tried his best."}
{"text":"Best burger in town.   I'm normally not a fan of turkey burgers, but theirs is to die for. It is good as a \"Frenchie\" and also amazing as the protein in a \"Build Your Own Salad.\"   The portions are good, the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is fun and relaxing.   I love their sweet potato fries, while my boyfriend goes for the duck fat fries.   I've never heard a bad review for Big Daddy's. They definitely have \"raving fans.\""}
{"text":"Pretty good if you can get in!! Last three times I've attempted to go there this place was packed no parking and no room on the curb to sit!! But based off of the times i have been able to dine there it 's been good  I always get the Sam I Am burger with no pesto it has Ham, Fried Egg, Cheese, and Burger! It's Delicious!! I get it with either the sweet potato fries or build your own salad. The service could be a little bit more \"polished\" but i guess they are going for that caring but not caring attitude!! All in all this place is good"}
{"text":"Chicken and burgers were awesome!  Ask for Kyle who is a great server he engages with the customer adding value to the dining experience. Great Job Bad Daddy's Burger"}
{"text":"Ordered a chili cheese burger. They brought it out 15 minutes later with no chili. I asked about the chili and the bartender said, \"we've been out of chili all day\". Thanks for telling me before I ordered it.  The burger was meh. The service was meh. I'll not be eating here during my next layover in Richmond."}
{"text":"Not bad, they had Guinness. Sat at the bar, great service, friendly and helpful bartender. Had the stuffed burger (w/pimento -July special) with tater tots. Was good wasn't great. The sauce with the tots little kick, barbecue-ish yummy. Burger and string fries was good. If in the area might stop in again try other sandwiches or the salads."}
{"text":"We come here often because their burgers are delicious and so are their salads. They have TONS of options and different choices for everything on their menu. This is our favorite burger spot, hands down. The reason for 4 stars, the service is so slow!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers in town! I live that they sell locally brewed beers and they have truffle fries. Nick's Patty Melt is the best with the truffle fries."}
{"text":"Used to come here alot when they first opened and probably would have rated them with 4 stars.  Seems the prices have gone up a bit since then and the food is more or less the same.  The place is still busy and in a good location.  I still go every so often and still enjoy myself.  Just feels a little overpriced now."}
{"text":"Ugh - from the bad start to service (it did get better over time - although unpolished and lukewarm friendly throughout) through my meal - this place never lives up to its cool name.  Don't let big companies (HMS Host in this case) try to create and execute cool concepts - it doesn't work.  My $14 burger (+ $1.99 to add a sad salad instead of fries) was ok at best - and while I'll always take something under cooked as opposed to over cooked,  my medium rare was almost raw in the middle - and still cool! Lastly,  they served my bunless burger in what looked like a dog bowl - which made it difficult to cut and eat.  All in all - meh at best. Sorry,  Bad Daddy - I think you're just bad."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious quick meal here on my last trip trough CLT. The patty melt, sweet potato fries, and large beer were served quickly."}
{"text":"I fell for Big Daddy's Burger Bar right away. Another reviewer said Big Daddy's is the way to get out-of-town friends to visit again. As a visitor, I must agree. I definitely want to return on my next trip to Charlotte.   Everything here was delicious. I enjoyed the Sam I Am burger with fried egg, rosemary ham, American cheese and pesto. YUM! The sweet potato fries were perfection. The strawberry milkshake made me want to sing with delight.   The friendly service and excellent patio atmosphere were cherries on top of a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Food is consistently good. Service is good. It never lets you down!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite to eat between flights. Waited 45 minutes for 2 salads and the burger on steroids. Get the burger...its their speciality. Chicken on salad was overcooked."}
{"text":"Just a random stop in at Charlotte airport. The hostess was very sweet and sat us right away. The service was quick and the breakfast sandwich with potatoes was very yummy. Big portions too...."}
{"text":"Loved our turkey burgers! The portions were great! Try the Snickers Milkshake! It's delicious! I was excited that they had sweet potato fries! YUM!"}
{"text":"Came up to visit a friend after they ran a half marathon in Huntersville. We had just missed the brunch special. I got the Bad Ass Burger with French fries covered in chilli. Overall the food was great. The lettuce and tomato was fresh and the burger was cooked to perection for me.  I also got the Two Hearted ale, from Bell's Brewery in Kalamazoo, MI. That was the perfect beer for the burger.  Bonus-the kids meals were just enough for my 4 yo and 2 yo. And their meals come with desert. :)  Will visit again."}
{"text":"First time here and I am not much of a burger person.  I had the black bean burger which was by far the best I've had. Everything was delicious service was great and great special on draft beer. We def would go back and bring our kids again. Our waiter was patient and attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome burger and pretty decent service. I do wish they had more side options, but then again you shouldn't expect many from a burger joint. While I wouldn't quite say this is the best burger I've had, I'd certainly rank it in the top 5. It's a must go!"}
{"text":"Great burger tonight.  Tried the blue cheese crumbles and mushrooms on Texas toast.  Tater tots were great."}
{"text":"What a great surprise to walk into CLT airport and there is a bad daddy's in the airport. What has become a neighborhood stable in other parts of town, now is brought to Charlotte Douglas. I prefer the Sam I am burger but on lighter days I always have the black bean burger. The black bean burger is super tasty, filling, but yet much lighter then having a burger. Not a bad way to start a vacation at the airport."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Visiting from out of town and craving a good burger.  The food was OK but the service left a lot to be desired.  We arrived at 8pm, after the dinner rush, and we were seated promptly but waited almost 10 minutes before anyone took our drink order.  I had clear vision of the drink/order area were 4 people were working (including the manager).  I made eye contact with all four of them and it was obvious we were waiting to give an order (menus on the table, no drinks, looking around) and still no one came.  I had just suggested we leave when someone finally came for our drink order.  When she brought them back she just  set them down and walked away and we sat for another 3 or so minutes until a guy came over and said our server was busy so he would help out and take our order.  We each ordered a burger medium ( hot, pink center). When they arrived one of them was raw to the point of being cold in the center, so we had to send it back.  Our server was very apologetic and offered a free dessert.  While we were eating the manager came over and apologized and said she would comp one meal.  Okay, that's better.  The server offered to still comp a dessert if we wanted it, which we declined.  When the bill came, it was discounted but they charged us for 3 burgers instead of the 2 we ordered so it was still wrong, although they corrected it quickly.  Overall, it felt like the first girl was our real server but she knew she messed up by not getting our order so she traded tables with our second server so she could still make a tip from someone else.  Our second server was good, attentive, apologetic, and appropriately called the situation to the attention of the manager.  But the overall experience is what would keep me from returning if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Ahhhmazing. Like seriously. Why is this place so good?  We stopped in on Sunday for lunch. The parking lot was packed and we knew we'd made a good choice but no clue we'd literally just hit the jackpot on Burger Bars in Charlotte! This is my kind of place....tons of burger options with your choice of fries or tots. Oh yes, sign me up every time.   We started with an order of the buffalo wings. Shut up. They came out pipping hot....literally right out the pan. We got both ranch and blue cheese (what!?) and enjoyed every bite! They aren't too spicy but have a great amount of flavor. I'd recommend them and absolutely order them again.   For burgers, Derrick tried the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids and I opted for the Cantina. Soooo me being jealous that his burger came with 6 pieces of bacon (Mmmm....bacon) I added jalapeno bacon and jalapenos to mine. These really are some of the best burgers in town. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth with each bite. Not joking...they are that good.   Guys, seriously. This is how a burger should be....stacked up with toppings so big you can barely get your mouth open enough for a good bite! Yums. Add to that tots and fries and you might as well just consider the rest of your day a bust....because you will need a nice long nap!"}
{"text":"I loved there customers service! It's the best! I have to say though I think I had better burgers than this place. This place is okay for me. I'm a vegetarian so I made my own burger and I thought there burgers were okay!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, pretty fast turn around so you shouldn't have a terrible wait. They are VERY popular, though, so get there early if you can!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and i visited on Friday and were pleasantly surprised at the service and the food. So, on Saturday after a shopping excursion, me and one of my daughters went for lunch AGAIN! The food was the same - on POINT! The Bad Ass Burger with buttermilk dipped bacon is to die for.  We prefer sitting outside on the porch and it was very pleasant. They even had NCAA basketball on the big screen tv. I would recommend this place to anybody who hasnt been and i will defintely be travelling from the airport area (where i work) and Northlake area (where i live) to Dilworth, for the best burgers in town! Thank you"}
{"text":"Had me a badass burger, and to say that I loved it, would be an understatement. It was a religious experience. Great service, great burgers and fries...just a great experience, definitely worth repeating!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The service was ok. There was a hair in my dressing and I felt kinda brushed off by the server. I will say, she kept my drink full, and she brought out everything we requested in a timely fashion. All in all it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"excellent burgers and fries. They are busy all the time but we still get seated pretty quickly. The bacon cheese burger is awesome, but you really cant go wrong with any choice you make."}
{"text":"You might be surprised to see my review of Big Daddy's since I don't eat red meat!  But my husband and I love this place!  You can get a veggie burger in place of any beef for all the burgers-my favorite is the Cantina 1511 bean burger which has guac!  Other favorites are the fried pickles and tater tots.  Rather than choose from the standard menu my husband likes to create his own.  He loves pimiento cheeseburgers.  There's also a fun bar area with a nice beer selection and plenty of TVs for sports.  Also fun is the daily milkshakes--yumm!  I wouldn't recommend this as a place to take a group if you're planning to chat it up because the music is always too loud.  But it's perfect for 2-4 people who can sit pretty close and enjoy a delish burger with a cold beer."}
{"text":"Awesome place, staff and food!  I had the shrimp burger!  Wow what a refreshing change and wonderful taste, accented by sweet potatoe fries with chipotle sauce! The bartender, Joshlin was a pleasant assistant to a wonderful evening !  A must visit and bookmarked !  Nice beer selection and pub atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Cold beer and decent food. Staff was friendly. I had a burger and tater tots. Not the best burger I've ever had but I was hungry and it hit the spot. Tater tots were pretty good. Not bad for airport food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service, the buttermilk fried bacon is to die for. Server was excellent and knew the menu well."}
{"text":"Had a quick burger and it was fantastic. With sweet potato fries dipped in their signature sauce. I haven't had a better burger in a long time. Unfortunately the milkshake machine was broken. Western burger was great. Well cooked. Light on the sauce. (I usually like more sauce) It was quick, even though the place was almost full. That is important at the airport. I was in and out in under 25 minutes. It was great. The server was excellent and attentive."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We waited 10 minutes to get a menu and drink orders after being seated. Then waited another 25 minutes to get our food. We were headed on a flight and couldn't enjoy the food because of the long wait. It was a burger!!! 25 minutes is excessive. If you have a couple of hours, give it a try. If not, buy your burger elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This is a review on the airport location in Charlotte, NC. We had a 4 hour lay over and decided to try this place for lunch. Pretty busy. Service was slow.  But regardless of the slow service and food taking forever, it was actually DELICIOUS!!! I ordered an avocado burger (and they didn't scimp on the avocado either)!!! We also ordered a southwestern burger and a plan cheeseburger with an Oriental chicken salad. ALL OF THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I wanted to order a milkshake but our waitress took pretty long to come back after bringing our food out that we only had 30 mins left before boarding and had to leave. They looked reaaaally good wish I could've tried one.  TRY THIS PLACE FOR LUNCH IF YOU ARE EVER IN THE CHARLOTTE AIRPORT!!!"}
{"text":"Bad Daddys is the place I recommend to most friends when asking for a good, reliable burger. I love the laid back atmosphere, the choice to make your own, and the choices for wonderful salads as well.  In my most recent visit, I went with the turkey burger, topped with feta cheese, sauteed onions and mushrooms and avocado on the multigrain bun. They don't skimp you on the toppings, that's for sure. The multigrain bun was surprisingly tasty. Also, please don't go to Bad Daddy's without ordering the sweet potato fries. They have some of the best sweet potato fries in all of Charlotte, in my opinion. My husband ordered the grilled buffalo sandwich with a side of tots. I love the tots also, but the sweet potato fries are the key to my heart.  The service was great and our waiter was attentive. They have a decent cocktail list and also a fair amount of local Charlotte brews on tap. They have a rotating tap for 4-5 local breweries.   Love that they have the patio for the option of sitting outdoors, or staying inside away from the heat. A great summer hang out!"}
{"text":"Was shocked they charged 16 bucks for a regular house, not a double, just a plain Jane Bloody Mary. One drink 16 bucks plus tax and tip. Twenty bucks. I have eaten here before food is pretty good. Kinda feel this was overpriced. Was it good? yes was it worth the 16 bucks? Hell no. Beware, no prices on menu. Asked to make sure charges were correct, waiter stated it was, oh well in Charlotte airport at least twice a week pretty much every week.  Will not get burned again."}
{"text":"Do you like to disregard cholesterol levels or potential artery blockage? If so, this is the place for you. Fried pickles are amazing. I enjoy the ability to really customize your burger, but the menu items are great as well. You've gotta try the Sam I Am burger. Aside from that... I have the three most American words ever combined for your imagination... Deep. Fried. Bacon."}
{"text":"Not terrible for airport food but definitely not my favorite either. I've been here all times of the day and the food has gotten worse over time. The salads used to be great but the one I got wasn't even good last time I tried one. Breakfast was mediocre. Soggy but stale toast. No taste potatoes. And since when has mushrooms been considered an expensive veggie requiring a $1.50 up charge?"}
{"text":"My family and I eat at Bad Daddy's all the time. It is one of our favorite local neighborhood restaurants. The Bad Daddy's service is 5 stars.  One time I was stealing bacon from my Dad's burger. The waiter caught me and brought me bacon of my own. The food is 4 stars. My favorite is the kid sliders and my Dad likes the Frenchie.  The sweet potato fries are awesome.  The ambience is 4 stars. They even let me bring my dog on the patio."}
{"text":"Bad daddy's has the best burgers ever. They cook the meat so well and it's so tender and the fries are seasoned to perfection. The milieu is great"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's did its local brand a disservice by opening this location. I get airports are frantic busy crazy places. However, the service here is just terrible. I sat down for 25 mins (thank God for technology to keep you busy) before being approached by someone asking if I had been helped. I said no, so instead of getting my drink order he said ok let me go get your server. Fast forward 15 minutes or so and here she is with a no-name introduction and a what can I get you? Well, you could've gotten me a meal 40 mins ago but now I will get a beer and the check. Get the beer in about another 10 mins, no check. Give her card instead, comes back 10 mins later with check and card. Don't go here unless you have a ridiculously long layover or the patience of Buddha. Can't imagine the food being as amazing as the other 3 locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is delicious. It is the best burger chain restaurant in the area that I have encountered as of yet. I like getting a burger with bacon and blue cheese. They cook my burger to a perfect medium and its never dried out. I especially like the side salad option and that you get to pick your own ingredients. It certainly is NOT one of those premade iceberg salad mixes like you get at some places. You get to choose between 4 greens (I get spinach) and then can add 7 additional ingredients. It has been too long since I have been by Bad Daddy's and I expect to be back real soon!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and the service wasn't great.  took about 10 minutes before anyone came to the table after we were seated.  Food took a long time to come out, and the check took a long time...and then my credit card was given to another customer and vice versa.  It was not overly busy, but there lacked a normal sense of urgency.  Food was pretty good but a bit greasy(but hey, it's a burger joint so I knew what I was getting into there!).  Bottom line, just a bit of a miss.  Maybe new servers or no manager or something was up.  I wouldn't say don't go, but it was just kind of annoying more than anything."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday lunch date at 1pm there was still a 10 minute line but service was great.  We were seated after a short wait and got our burgers within ten minutes of ordering.    My burger with bacon was smaller than I expected. But in these days of over-sized expensive portions it was probably just right.  With a side of sweet potato fries I was definitely full and for two people (without alcohol) our tab was roughly twenty bucks.    I don't find their tall tables and bar chairs very comfortable, which is the majority of their seating.  However they do have booths if you're willing to wait.  The bar area itself is limited.  But all-in-all it's a cool space and I'll be back on a weekend to see what's happening.    Update: Been several times and the burgers are consistently good.  They have a new cocktail menu.  The music selection is somewhat random, top forty one day and edgy alternative the next.  But I think they're working out the kinks and are quickly becoming a neighborhood icon.  The downside is that now it's always crowded and quickly turning into a see and be seen atmosphere.  If you're looking for a relaxing burger this isn't really it anymore..."}
{"text":"Went here for our first time tonight. We had two very tasty burgers with sides of tater tots and sweet potato fries- everything was great. We had first ordered homemade chips as an appetizer-- they tasted awful because they were overdone. But our waitress was nice enough to remove them from our bill. We had a great visit overall and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff was courteous and extremely nice! Black bean burger was top notch! Beer was cold and family friendly... What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and fried pickles with a fun atmosphere. But as with any restaurant in Birkdale, you'll have a tough time getting a table during the weekend."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had. I will come back for sure. the food portion was huge and the nacho app was to die for. Though it is a little crowded during peak hours. Everything was great"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is one of our favorite locations for lunch or dinner.  We've been several times since they opened in Ballantyne and we've never been disappointed.  The service is always great, attentive and very informative.  They have awesome daily special burgers and drinks.  On a Friday or Saturday the place is usually pretty packed, and tonight was no different, but our server, Ashley, was FANTASTIC!  She was so attentive and helpful and made suggestions that were genuine and didn't feel \"sales-y\".    I usually do the build your own salad, but tonight I went with the Cantina burger (veggie) and it was awesome.  Hubs always gets the Western burger (buffalo) and he swears buy it.  Juicy, meaty and totally delicious.   My favorite appetizer is the fried pickles, but tonight we tried the homemade chips and pimento cheese and it was also awesome.    As we were paying the bill our server (Ashley) asked if we'd ever been in for breakfast and we said we hadn't.  She offered us a to-go menu and told us we should certainly check it out.  (And I'm sure we will)!  I highly recommend Bad Daddy's for a work lunch, a lunch w/friends or a night out with the family.  Great atmosphere, excellent food and fantastic service.  Proud to call this franchise local and excited to see where it goes!"}
{"text":"Airport beer is supposed to be expensive.  I know this.  It is not supposed to be gouge your eyeballs out expensive, however.  I noticed there were no beer prices on the menu - but saw a 24 oz PBR on there and figured - what's the worst that can happen..... $4?  Maybe $5?  Wish I had asked.  This everyman beer staple can be had at your local grocer for $1.19, and Bad Daddy's is charging $7.50 for a 24 oz CAN of PBR.  Come on.  Almost as bad they charge $10 for a 20 oz draft beer.  Make sure you ask for the beer prices if you happen to stop here for a drink.  I'm fine with getting ripped off to the tune of $6.50 for a pint of craft beer in an airport - I understand that's how it works.  $10 for 20 oz draft and $7.50 for a 24 oz can of PBR is straight up redonk."}
{"text":"Pretty basic restaurant. Decent burgers and service. Casual place, good for families, and fast service. Nothing special but good place to meet up with friends or a weekday family dinner."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is delicious. It is the best burger chain restaurant in the area that I have encountered as of yet. I like getting a burger with bacon and blue cheese. They cook my burger to a perfect medium and its never dried out. I especially like the side salad option and that you get to pick your own ingredients. It certainly is NOT one of those premade iceberg salad mixes like you get at some places. You get to choose between 4 greens (I get spinach) and then can add 7 additional ingredients. It has been too long since I have been by Bad Daddy's and I expect to be back real soon!"}
{"text":"Truly disappointed tonight: we called at 715pm on a Friday night asking what the wait would be for our party-- they said no wait. We left our home and were there within 15 minutes. Lo and behold, there is a 25 minute wait, with 15-20 people waiting outside for their tables too. When confronted about this, they refused to give us an explanation. We don't stand for that kind of trickery, and promptly left and patronized a better establishment. Would have been nice to try this place; they've lost all our future business."}
{"text":"Great Burger and local brew!  Excited you guys are opening a location in Nashville soon.  Welcome to Tennessee!"}
{"text":"BF and I checked out this spot on Saturday evening.  The parking lot was packed and we ended up finding a spot in the nearby overflow business park.  Upon entering, we saw the servers working feverishly delivering food to the patio tables. The steps are somewhat slippery and stacked. We were praying they did not slip and bust their heads. Anyway, there was a 15 min wait which was not bad. Per our server's recommendation, we ordered the fried pickles. They were cut long versus traditional chips and came with chipotle ranch dressing. We really liked that they were lightly breaded, but prefer half the sodium.  For burgers, we enjoyed the turkey and Carolina burgers.  I liked the homemade slaw and the chili with beans was lukewarm at best. Still pretty tasty.  Sweet potato fries were yummy.  Maybe next time we will try the spike milkshakes or dessert.   Service was decent and we will keep this place on our dining rotation, but keep in mind the tight parking."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place!  Great variety in burgers, good selection of beers, and friendly apps.  Great place for families, kids, and groups.  Nice \"outdoor\" covered patio with flat screen TVs."}
{"text":"With a trendy name like Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, I was expecting a bad ass twist on the American burger or at least a darn good burger. The food was just barely ok and for the price I am disappointed. The burger was dry and the onion straws were soggy."}
{"text":"Soooo these Burgers are SUPER duper extra large.... and good. My husband got a burger near the size of my head.  We both enjoyed our meal, this is a spot we will return for sure. We had the fried pickles as an appetizer, they weren't my favorite. They were cut long ways and hard to eat. He flavoring wasn't the best either. Next time I would try something else. I love fried pickles so I usually get them wherever I go.   We waited only for a few minutes before being seated. The entire waitstaff was really friendly and helpful. Dinner is always 100 times better with the right staff.   They had a pretty large beer selection but for some reason any beer I wanted they didn't have. I think they need a bit more variety."}

{"text":"Excellent food and great burgers!!! I love all the burgers here. My friend Olivia and I were eating here before work one day and she got the burger with the fried egg on it and she was so ready to eat it. Also, side note, our waitress was from a different country and she had a cool accent. Anyway, Olivia took a bite into the burger and the friend egg squirted all over her face, clothes, and even her hands. She looked like she just gave a sloppy toppy. Lol it was funny."}
{"text":"the burger was very good, and the pulled pork and BBQ sauce made it tasty, but the e real winner was the service.  Jordan was excellent.  got me hooked up with chili to go, and even though her drive in was difficult, and her impending drive home was looming (snowy here in Concord...probably 3+ inches) she was pleasant professional and attentive.  she's definitely a plus one star for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good solid lunch at a decent price.  The build your own options give you a chance to make healthy choices and the wonderful sides answer the call for fried comfort food.   Not sure what the fuss about service is? Each time I've been during a busy lunch, the staff has handled everything proficiently.  Sweet potato fries and black bean burger are a MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Really great black bean burger and Pimento dip with their homemade chips! Great place to spend a few hours before a flight.   The serving sizes are HUGE so make sure to share, we made that mistake!"}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, quick service, and great food!  Went here Saturday night for dinner a few weeks ago, and although our order was mixed up it's still worth going to again!"}
{"text":"If I'm waiting for a layover (or just leaving) CLT and I'm on US Airways in Terminal C, this is my restaurant of choice.  The food is better if you sit for table service, but at least they have a fairly quick (15 minute - 20 minute during rush time) if you do the take-out window.    They have a some good burger choices.  The chicken burger options are good too.  Between the fries, sweet potato fries, and tots; I would recommend you go with either the sweet potato or tots.  The burgers are pricier than other burger options in the airport, but I find the quality better for the turnaround time than going to a Burger King, etc.  The price with a soft drink and fries is usually in the $16 - $20 range, and for the type of meal in the airport isn't outrageous.  The wait staff seems somewhat distant but I'm usually stuck flying late afternoon so I don't expect the most cheerful people.  The reason to eat here is the burgers.  They do have a bar so if you have more time to kill and aren't urgently trying to make a flight I recommend you dine in for a better burger"}
{"text":"Big Daddy's is my go-to place for a great burger in Charlotte.  I've been here several times and my food has always been perfect.  One of my favorite things about this place is they use locally sourced produce and grass feed beef.  They also have a large variety of micro brewed beers.  My favorite burger is the \"Sam I Am\" burger which has ham, pesto, and a fried egg on top.  Don't' forget to order tots with your burger.  They have a beer flight which offers four 3oz tastes of beer, great for when you can't decide.  They also have daily drink specials which are a decent deal."}
{"text":"My experiences at Bad Daddy's are \"okay,\" they do some good things and they do some bad things.  They do have good burgers here, so if that is what you are looking for you will not be disappointed.  I do not care for their fries though, and the tater tots and chips are typically over salted.  They also accept the local \"Ballantyne Card,\" which gives you a 15% discount from 11am-1pm; which is good because they are somewhat pricy.  The atmosphere is loud by design.  The menu selection is robust, so there should be something for everyone.  If you come in a group of four or more, the wait time takes longer than normal; sometimes you have to grab the waiter's attention for service."}
{"text":"I always get one of the turkey burgers and tots and always leave happy, full and with a doggy bag. If you are in the mood for a burger, its your best bet. Service is good with a pleasant atmosphere and lots of tv's for watching sports. Parking is tight but not a big deal."}
{"text":"I literally just left a fairly slow restaurant. After a 25 minute wait for bacon and eggs I had to leave without having the food I paid for to make my plane. I can't say I'm impressed. It shouldn't take that long for bacon and eggs especially when it's not slammed. That said, I had a $25 Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Long lines but worth the wait. Delicious burgers, fries, sweet potatoes, tater tots... Will be back!"}
{"text":"Four Stars for a place in an airport. Yes.   Every once in a while I get a 2 hour or more break between flight so I get to sit down and eat.   Usually in Charlotte I go to Carolina BBQ or Bojangles. They are fast and easy to eat once your flying. And also tasty but average.   Anyway back to the burger.   Decent bun. Good size patty. About 1/3 pound. Got cheddar and bacon with mushrooms. Asked for medium rare and got it medium rare. And to the person whose bottom bun was soggy. That's what you get with a good juicy not overcooked burger.   The fries were a bit to the cold side but they were still good.   Price. It was $16 with a drink and tax but what do you expect for a sit down place with a wait staff. So add tip to that as well.   It's not BK or Mc Ds. You have to pay if you want good food.   To me it was worth  the $20."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service. Took 45 minutes for our food to come out. Several tables that were seated after us received their food and we're finished before ours came. Never heard from our waiter. He quickly dropped the food and ran off before we could ask for anything. Fries were still frozen. Asked multiple waiters for assistance with our table and never received it. Went to the \"to-go\" section to ask for ranch and was given attitude like it wasn't here job and couldn't leave her section. I understand she may not have been able to leave, but as soon as I sat back at my table she proceeded to walk laps around the restaurant. Very unhappy with the service all around."}
{"text":"It may not be fair to review this place yet... but I would recommend waiting until the newness wears off before even attempting to eat here, especially on a weekend. I am alone, and therefore was able to snag a seat at a the bar, bypassing the 50+ people outside. But I'm a dummy and didn't realize the full house would cause the food to take FOREVER. I ordered a takeout meal for my mom (after receiving my own order), and I am ready to leave without the food and forgo the $11 burger and take her McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"I love this place! We've been twice in the last month and have enjoyed it both times! It's hard to find a local dig where you get awesome food without spending $20 on a burger. This place solves that with awesome burgers bellow $15. Build your own, you can even get bison (which I'm a big fan of.) You've got to try the jalapeno bacon, enough said. The service has been great, but expect a 15-20 minute wait at a minimum. Good food attracts a big crowd and this is no expectation. Great house beer, great fries, great everything!"}
{"text":"Told to find a seat by the window.  Waited for 15 min. pushing the service button once every 5 min for the first 10 min.  Waiters and waitresses walked by as I tried to get their attention.  They just would say... \"I'm busy.  Someone will be by.\"   Finally I just kept hitting the button over and over for 30 seconds after 15 min.  A waitress then appears...talking to someone else and saying loudly, \"let me tell this guy I'll get to him.  He's pushed the button 5000 times.\"  Sure enough she told me rudely in a manner that said \"I don't care when I get around to you.\"   Others around me were complaining about the attitudes, and the food quality.  I ended up walking out after holding a menu I had gotten up and got myself.  Do yourself a favor, walk away.  Go get Burger King.  At least you know what your paying for."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and the only thing I have to complain about is that they don't have one where I live! We had a party of 8 and the service was wonderful I never had an empty drink which makes me happier than you'll ever know. Their sweet tea is spot on and I ordered the frenchie with sweet potato fries and it was one of the best burgers I have ever had! I also love the decor and vibe of this place. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Supremely mediocre. I had a black bean burger, which was adequate; the bread, however, was squishy and flavorless. Some of the fries were well seasoned, though not crisp, but others might as well have been plain strips of fried potatoes. The barbecue sauce that came on the side was good by my taste, but coming from Alaska, I'm hardly an expert on that.   My biggest complaint was the service; it took a minute to even find the hostess, and, once seated, I didn't see the server for at least ten minutes. I understand it was busy, and it appeared he was the sole server for the restaurant section, but there were multiple girls standing around who should be being used as servers, if only to turn over tables faster. I did receive my drink and food fairly quickly, which was appreciated after the wait; I just wish it had a little more attention to detail.   I wouldn't recommend this place, and if I come through this airport again will try the wine bar in the atrium instead."}
{"text":"I love Bad Daddy's! The food is fresh, the turkey burgers are juicy, and the tots always taste delicious. Their special mayos and sauces are yummy. You can customize your burger in endless ways. They have awesome drink specials and local beers. I can't say enough how much I love that this is my local burger joint. I'm thrilled that they're going to expand their footprint because I think more people could use tasty burgers in their lives. On weekends, expect long lines for dinner, but don't sweat it -- the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Our 2 visits to the original East Blvd location were sort of hit or miss but we really liked the concept of the place, so we tried the new Ballantyne location over the weekend.  The bar was not 100% stocked yet and the kitchen was VERY SLOW with our order... but we were willing to cut them some slack since they had only been open a couple of days.  However, our server and his manager definitely took care of us and made the extra effort to really make us happy.  To compensate for their shortcomings, they gave us a complimentary appetizer and a free round of beers.   The meat eaters in our house love the burgers and those of us who do not eat red meat have great options with their homemade Black Bean burger, Turkey burgers, and Chicken breast sandwiches.   They also have some great \"build your  own salad\" options. They have great pimento cheese, french onion dip, and homemade ketchup.  In terms of phyiscal layout, I personally prefer the Ballantyne location over the East Blvd location - its more open and there is more space to spread out and feel comfortable.  (The East Blvd location has too many tables packed in too close together and you feel like you're on top of neighboring patrons.) While they are still working out the kinks at Ballantye, they get an \"A\" for effort.  We will definitely be going back and recommending it to our friends as well!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this establishment.  The burger's were well seasoned, though they could be a bit bigger.  They were cooked perfectly, this was a huge plus.  I haven't had a burger so nicely cooked in awhile.  I got an applewood bacon burger with swiss and big daddy's sauce.  So good!  The sweet potato fries were superb.    I went back a second time for lunch and got the Sam-I-Am sandwich which was very, very unique.  I would recommend it as it is a flavor you probably won't experience elsewhere.  I thought \"pesto, egg, on a burger?\" just like you would, but it was really good.  The egg was runny, so if you don't like your egg cooked that way you may want to avoid this or ask for your egg cooked a bit longer.    They have a great atmosphere and it's conveniently located.  If I get a chance to go back I definitely will."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's Burger Bar is a good meeting place. Outdoor seating and under $20 per person.   I had a patty melt with pimento cheese, it's not on the menu, I made it up and I enjoyed it!  (For a kick, add jalapenos).   We ordered onion straws and tater tots, love the idea of tots, they aren't easy to find in restaurants, but they didn't come out hot. Lukewarm fried foods coming out of the kitchen is one of my biggest restaurant peeves.  My friend ordered a burger with jalapeno bacon.  In my best robot voice, must try jalapeno  bacon .  We shared a chocolate milkshake, their milkshakes are a MUST!!!  Some people ask about where can you get rare hamburgers, they take a temp when you order.  Big Daddy's gets a three tot rating.  They have french fries cooked in duck fat on Thursday, Friday & Saturday, I have never had them, but I hear it's a treat.  It seems like all my visits are never on the weekend.  Must get out there and try those fries."}
{"text":"Very greasy burger. Fries, Drinks and service were okay. If I don't go back I wouldn't be upset."}
{"text":"I had the Sam I Am and it was awesome. Have it with bacon, Jalapeño bacon, and onion strings. The waitress Elise was friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and is considered one of our \"to go to\" restaurants when we're not sure where we want to eat. We usually order the Southern burger and the Cantina burger. Both are always good! If you want to eat a burger but feel guilty with the fries, chips or tater tot, their fruit is really good...but the tater tots are amazing!  It comes with a dipping sauce. Worth it! Always a good selection of local NC beers. I have found that Monday - Thursday, it's easier to get a table fro dinner. The bar works well if you just need a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers in town. I highly suggest u try them out. Staff is great for most parts."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been trying to get to eat here for months. We finally got the opportunity, and only a 15 min wait. The service was spot on, Thomas (?) I believe was our waiter outside. Great Work!  Drinks where good and food was amazing! We both had burgers. Also had truffle fries for appetizer.So good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have to call these are Airport Quality burgers. I love the location in Birkdale, and the burgers are way much better there----thicker, perfect medium/medium rare as we ordered and even lettuce are happier looking!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast the other day before a flight. The service was good, both pleasant and efficient. The food not so much. I got the Popeyes scramble, which was eggs mixed with spinach, mushrooms and feta. The scrambled eggs were overcooked (they had a dark brown crust), there was approximately 1/2 piece of spinach in the entire dish, and the feta tasted off, not delicious at all. The sides were subpar as well. The toast was simultaneously burnt and cold/doughy (very strange) and the potatoes were meh. Wish I could have gotten fruit but they were out.   I know we are at the airport, but my breakfast was pretty much inedible. If you are stuck here in the AM, I would recommend the omelette, that's what the husband ordered and he found it quite tasty."}
{"text":"Went for a drink and a burger. Lunch crowd had dwindled but we waited 5-7 minutes for a table. Our waitress was on point to take our orders promptly and delivered our drinks right away.  I got a bad ass margarita. It wasn't great. It was a glass of lime juice.  It took about 20 minutes after the drinks to get our food delivered.  My husband enjoyed his burger but my patty melt was rare inside when asked for medium. I ate around the raw meat and left about half on the plate.  Not sure we will be back to this location."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from a co-worker. I opted for one of the chicken sandwiches...it was good. It's chicken. The other two in my party had the burgers and the way they inhaled them, I think they would likely deserve 5 stars.  We shall return."}
{"text":"I've visited the other location prior to this one opening. The first time I came here it was crowded, of course. Knowing that it had opened not too long at that point, I didn't mind the wait. It is what it is.  Since, I have only ordered take out, because I don't like to wait. I understand it, I just don't like it. And this place always seems to be crowded.  The burgers are always cooked as ordered and taste great. The service is always welcoming and accommodating. I ordered once and when I arrived, they didn't have my order. I thought that maybe I had phone the wrong location. I hadn't. But the moment they realized it, they were on it and made sure to give me a complimentary item for my inconvenience."}
{"text":"I went back yesterday for my first visit since they rebranded as Bad Daddy's.  I decided to order the Texican Chicken Salad ($9.50)  which normally is served with fried bacon-encrusted chicken (ick) but they were happy to substitute plain grilled chicken instead.  Also, I had them hold the onions and the salad was perfect.   In addition to iceberg lettuce & tomato, the salad also includes black beans and corn (fresh off the cob), cilantro, tortilla strips, and chipotle ranch sauce (which I got on the side).  The salad dressing had just the right amount of slow burn and the flavors were perfectly balanced. This is the most delicious salad I've had in a long time!   My friend ordered a burger and chips. His only complaint was that they were a little too generous with the mayo.... but other than that, he was happy. I tried one of his chips and it was really a good homemade chip - crispy and not greasy.  Service was good last night - they were busy, but our server promptly took our order and kept our drinks filled.   Yep, this is the place to go if someone is hankering for a super salad or fresh cooked to order burgers (including turkey or black bean burgers)."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the burgers, but the chips and dip and wings were pretty good. And they have decent beer. Probably the best spot in this airport for food and/or a drink. It can get crowded (as it is the best spot to kill time), but the wait is worth it by comparison. The service is definitely airport-quality (a.k.a. sub-par). The decor is kinda out-of-the-box, but it's a nice change of pace from what you typically encounter in airports. And there's plenty of TVs if you're into sports or watching the news."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty burgers...but huge! I normally do the \"make your own\", with pickles, jalapeño bacon, ketchup & mustard. Tater tots are a must, but come in a salad bowl...so much to eat! Spiked milkshakes are amazing. Oooh & their wings! Yuuuum!  The restaurant itself is small. But there is a patio.  Wait staff is nice & helpful."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Love their tator tots and milkshakes.  They have a selection of burgers on the menu for you to choose from, or you can build your own, starting about $7.50.  Their service is surprisingly slow, even when they're not packed.  Fine if you're with good company and you're not starving. Not a place to go if you want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you how the food tasted but after a 30 minutes of waiting I had to go catch my flight. The waitress was great. But that's about it."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! and the service was great!!!. Yea it's out of the way but it is worth going too if you want a tasty and delicious burger."}
{"text":"The food is so great & the employees are so friendly and helpful. Love this place! Great atmosphere, awesome beer options & the burgers are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"My friend who moved to Charlotte took me here on a Wednesday night, which is their \"Mug Night\". Most draft beers, including Samuel Adams seasonal are only $5 for a big mug, comparable to a Haufbrauhouse mug. What a good deal.   I ordered a breakfast burger with an egg and pesto sauce. It was simply amazing. It comes with tater tots, man it was tasty."}
{"text":"Love me some Bad Daddy's!   The homemade chips are one of the items that keeps me coming back and looking forward to having a lunch meeting at either location.   The burgers/sandwiches are great. Nice portion of beef or other sandwich-friendly insides. Not your run-of-the-mill burger. Definitely some of the better combinations out there. The Mama Ricotta burger is awesome and different and the Cantina 1511 is a knockout. Love green chilies on a burger!  The wings fit well on the \"expected\" side when it comes to flavor. Nothing groundbreaking. Also, a little disappointed that you can't order an entree-sized portion. They only come in a 7-8 count as an app. Kinda lame. What if I wanted 15? Too bad, brosef.   The only downside is their veggie burger. Not a huge fan of the texture. It's a little mealy and tends to fall apart. Definitely had better.  The milkshakes are bangin. Aaaaand you can get it SPIKED! So good. I had never tried a spiked milkshake, let alone heard of one, until I had gone to Bad Daddy's. Seriously worth a try. Better off splitting one of these bad boys (pun intended). It comes with some extra in the spin cup for your further sugar/dairy laden enjoyment.   Outdoor seating is phenomenal and you really can't go wrong on a spring day on East Blvd while being outside. The hightop communal tables at East Blvd cause a bit of a backup/walking issues. Beware if you are trying to get out while its busy.   Service is always friendly and fast. These guys are doing a great job with their entire chain of restaurants across the Queen City. Hats off, ladies and gents.   Great Charlotte staple. Perfect place for 2, family, with kids or whatever."}

{"text":"Our first Experience My family's first experience with Bad Daddy's Burger Bar was disappointing and frustrating, however perhaps the newness of the facility, inexperienced staff, and less than cordial/professional manager were all factors that I hope will be addressed in the coming months.  On Thursday, 10/19/2017, we visited the new location in Christenbury Corners (Concord, NC) electing to take a chance on the new establishment over our preferred restaurant in the area.  As a family, we rarely dine out due to other priorities (debt liquidation) so when we do it's a real treat for our family.  We value quality food, extraordinary customer service, and accommodating waiting times for seating and receipt of our food.    Long Waiting times 4 Seating/Food After a long arduous day at work, I and my family were famished and looking forward to dining out.  Unfortunately, on a Thursday night the waiting times for seating was longer than we anticipated as initially informed 25 minutes turned into 45 minutes. We were astonished but pressed on as my spouse and twins (9 years of age) anticipated at the very least good customer service and quality food.  Again, we were a little disappointed as the waitress didn't acknowledge us until after 25 minutes of being seated. Certainly, something was awry as the servers seem to scurry around in a maze and often looked befuddled in their duties and responsibilities.  So, if keeping count, we are 70 minutes in, before our order is taken.  Finally, the order is taken and the attentive server places our order delivering our drinks 5-10 minutes later.  However, we were lost during the interim as the server truly never checked in on us providing an update on the status of our food or offer any additional service while waiting.  We were overjoyed to receive our food ~25-30 minutes from the server taking our order so we are 95-100 minutes.  Perhaps this is the normal time from start to finish for this establishment, but we must say we haven't experienced this at a burger place before.  Our food was okay but we wouldn't say \"Great\".  My spouse' grilled chicken sandwich was overcooked and our burgers were well-done as opposed to our stated preference of medium cooked.  However, I concede perhaps our extended wait in the midst of being famished could have exacerbated our frustrated state at this point causing us to have overzealous expectations for quality, tasteful, and good food. ¬ Manager Coaching Needed The server could certainly ascertain our frustration as I questioned her on the length of time for the receipt of our food.  Her comment was \"we are busy and this is typical\" offering to have the manager come talk with us.  The inexperienced manager, I noticed prior to visiting my table wondered around the restaurant haphazardly to check on servers' contrary to checking-in with customers and seem more worried about adjusting the televisions in the establishment.  Upon finally visiting my table, he introduced himself awkward and wanted know if there was anything he could do.  I shared our frustration from the extended waiting time for seating, receipt of our food, and lack of customer service attendant to check-in with us or the cooks on our food order.  After listening, he stated their serving times are typically 20-30 minutes at this location and seating can take up to 30 minutes.  He didn't' offer an apology or offer to discount my $52 bill but did state he would talk with his servers on checking in with customers.  In my opinion, this inferred that in his mind the waiting times for seating and receipt of the food was within the acceptable range for either his establishment or Bad Daddy's Burger Bar.  For me and my family based on our many experiences in the past with other establishment this is unacceptable and does not meet our expectations in exchange for our patronage.   Another Opportunity In fairness, perhaps the newness of the establishment and poorly trained staff are all culprits to our disappointing experience.  We are certainly reluctant to visit Bad Daddy's Burger Bar but was encouraged by a friend to try another location.  Perhaps our experience was unique and once in an occurrence, thus I will continue to monitor the reviews on Yelp to hopeful see other positive reviews to determine if we may elect to visit this location (Christenbury Corners) or any other location in the future."}
{"text":"Yay for consistency! Bad Daddy's has it, hands down.  Monday brought my first visit to this location & we went for lunch. It was 12:30 & they were steady.  We were seated near the back of the restaurant, which was fine; however, the flies were crazy back in the corner! I'll get back to this in a moment...  I made my regular order of basic burger with avocado, bacon, & chipotle mayo, along with tater tots.  The boyfriend got a turkey burger, tots, & an almond spiked milkshake.   We were on a time crunch, because we were headed to a movie afterwards. Our waitress was really nice & efficient & read our order back to us.  Within about 10 minutes, our order arrived.  Now the flies were extremely happy! We spent our entire meal with food in one hand & swooshing away flies with the other. It was a bit annoying.  However, our food was delicious. My burger was cooked medium well, just like I asked.  The onion, lettuce, tomato, avocado, & pickle were fresh.  The bacon was crisp. And the TOTS!!! They were crisp & cooked perfectly. I was almost tempted to pull a Napoleon Dynamite & put some in my pocket for the movie!   Other than the fly issue, the place was clean.   I will say, the prices are a bit much, but the burgers are a decent size & they load you up on your side item."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a girlfriend, and although I enjoyed my lunch, I can't honestly say it was the best burger I've ever had. This would be one case I'd have to agree that \"less is more.\" I got Emilio's Chicken Sandwich with sweet potato fries, and I remember enjoying the meal, but the burger itself was not particularly memorable - I think all the bold ingredients just over-powered each other (buttermilk fried chicken, jalapeño bacon, huge chunk of mozzarella, guac, lettuce, tomato, onions, poblano pepper mayo) instead of complimenting each other. I'd be willing to give this place other chance by ordering a different item, but with so many other good burger joints in Charlotte, I have a feeling I won't be coming back here for a while."}
{"text":"My roommate had heard of Big Daddy's a while back but had never gotten around to trying it, so when the place we planned to patronize for lunch was closed for Labor Day we ended up heading over to give them a try (once we figured out which way we were supposed to be going). When we pulled up the place looked packed. The lot was full, as was the street parking for a few blocks. No problem, it was a nice day and even though we counted on a fairly sizable wait that was fine. Well, it would have been fine if we had actually had a sizable wait, but we were seated in less than 20 minutes. Nice start, BDs.  I stuck to water, but I did take a glance at the beer menu. I must say it was not too shabby, but then again, any beer menu with Shiner Bock on tap can't possibly be shabby not can it?  Like many other \"gourmet\" type burger places, Big Daddy's has a variety of loaded, combination-style offerings, but they are remarkably flexible about letting you switch their creations around. Don't want meat? Get a black bean burger under all those fancy toppings. Feeling a touch rugged? Try switching to buffalo. Just kicking it mild? Chicken sandwich for you. You can choose your bun, your cheese, your toppings and your meat, not to mention the side that goes with it. Some substitutes/add ons are gratis, some will cost you some change, but let it not be said that you can't get what you want.  I ended up with the Cantina 1511 Burger, a black bean burger topped with cheddar, monterey jack, avocado, green chilis and chipotle ranch, but I swapped the patty to beef and nixed the avocado. To go with I chose the sweet potato fries, which came with whole grain honey mustard. Everything was phenomenal, especially the fries, though I feel like the chipotle ranch sauce could have used a little more kick (although to be honest, I think that of just about everything).  My companion did it up Italian style with the Mama Ricotta's burger, which sports a beef burger, mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes and olive oil, on a wheat roll. He got the housemade chips with pimento cheese. The burger was tasty, however, one section was a bit too pink for either of our liking (we ordered both burgers Medium). The chips were crunchy, flavorful and top notch.  I will definitely be returning here next time I get a yearning for a creative burger. Or maybe even just a good beer and some fries."}
{"text":"Best place to get a hearty burger, good salads (the Tree Hugger is delicious), and a great milk shake.  Its a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"I'm a little displeased that my first burger out was their Bacon Cheeseburger on Steriods. Not that this burger was bad by any means, but you really have to build up a tolerance for this guy! I'll be honest, I left feeling a little woosey!   The menu is definitely worth a look. Although there are greasy & delicious burgers, there are also healthy alternatives as well. I could easily go back another dozen times before I go repeating an item. They have a good amount of unique items I am dying to try.   Other than great food, there are multiple TV's so you wouldn't have trouble finding a sought-after sports game shown there.   Parking is also pretty tight."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Hamburger came out wrong when I asked for medium and that was not over easy it was sunny side up period then got charged $15 for a Bloody Mary. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Not as good as the Huntersville location.  Birkdale has much better burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Best Burgers period.  Great service and love the new location in Birkdale Village."}
{"text":"As.far.as airport burger joints go, this one is pretty good. I had a shitake mushroom burger with aoili sauce and a side of fries that was delicious! Wash that down with a mudslide shake and I was done. The burger was cooked just right, everything came out piping hot [other than the shake :)] My server Brenda was very pleasant and attentive. Even though its a bit pricey for the shake, I'll eat here again on my next layover."}
{"text":"Chose this spot for a great burger - soooo disappointed.  My husband ordered a patty melt- medium.  It was cooked med rare so the bloody juice drained into the bottom half of sandwich making it a mushy mess.  I ordered nachos.  The chili was clearly canned and the cheese was not melted. There is an art to making nachos so the chips aren't mush - no art here.  The whole plate was a mushy mess.   Anyone can see we did not eat our food ....except the waitresses at Bad Daddy's. The highlight?  The fries were great. Won't be back. Not the same quality we remember"}
{"text":"Note: the food was great as was the service, (fast & efficient) however how my incident was handled was not handled well.   On November 27 I ate at Bad Daddy's Burger Bar in the Charlotte Air Port in terminal C - At around noon I entered the restaurant and slid completely down on the floor.  I was not injured.    One of the workers took my name and number after I ordered.    Then my food arrived and I ate it.   I was shocked when I saw my bill that I was charged for everything - an apology but not any kind of real courtesy was given.  It seems as though the staff was not even concerned that I was actually injured and yet they knew they have a very slippery floor.    Shocked that when I left no one cared what had happened -   They  need to do something about those floors! It was very scary & even more scary was the lack of actual concern."}
{"text":"Love Big Daddy's!  Their burgers are the best in town and they have lots of different toppings to go on them.  We usually go here on a Wednesday night when it's bring your own mug night up to 40 oz..  $3 gets you Bud Light, Miller Light, etc.  $5 gets you better bear like Blue Moon and such  $7 is the good stuff.  Their fried pickels are the best I've had so far and the Mama Ricotta burger is my favorite.  The only down side is parking sucks!  It's all street parking with a couple small lots that let you park there after 6pm.  The place is a little small and is always packed.  They have an outside patio that's nice.  Makes you feel bad when all the runners go by and you are chompin on a hamburger."}
{"text":"Big Daddy Burger bar is a very popular spot in the American Airlines terminal C at Charlotte Douglas International airport.    I visited on a layover back to Tampa from Charleston. They have a sit down restaurant and a to go window.  The wait time for to go food on this particular day was 15 to 20 minutes.  If you have the time to wait it is worth it.    The food is 4 stars for \"airport food\" you will not find anything else this good in terminal C if you are hungry. If not save your money and don't buy airport food at airport food prices."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled that this was the place that my friends picked to go, but I thought it was great. The rather poorly named Big Daddy's is located in the Dilworth neighborhood next to a lot of trendy restaurants. I expected Big Daddy's to be some douchey burger place with a lot of obnoxious people and loud music and too many TVs. It is a big of a sports bar but it was a nice place with great service. I'm always glad when I'm proved wrong about these things.  The place is busy. According to my friend there is always a wait. There is a large outdoor covered patio. The interior is big and industrial with a large bar area. There are a lot of TVs but the place wasn't super loud or annoying. The place is really clean and very nice.  I ordered the Frenchie which was a turkey burger with brie and grilled apples. It was delicious. I thought it was one of the best burgers I've had in a while. I also got the sweet potato fries which were really crispy and delicious.  The only problem was that my friends were freezing. There were fans on and open windows and it was really cold inside. I was fine but my two lady friends were very cold even though they had sweaters. Maybe it was just a weird weather day but might be something to consider.  I am glad that we tried this place. I would absolutely go back if given the chance."}
{"text":"Updating the review to say that I looked in at the bar as I walked past between connecting flights and it appeared much cleaner and organized compared to the day that I ate there.  I think the disorganization might have been an anomaly and not their usual state of operations."}
{"text":"After having bad service and being reluctant to go back, I decided to give it another go after management reached out to me. Food was good as always and the service was great! Much better this time."}
{"text":"Great post-movie spot for large selection of brews and creative burgers. On this occasion, we devoured Daddy's Nachos with all the right toppings. We walked in an hour before closing time and received great, cherry service which is impressive considering I'm sure our server had been on her feet all day. Love the chill vibe and sports on the tube."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is pretty bad, a 'good' bad that is =).  Great atmosphere and excellent service.  It's always packed every single time I come through Charlotte-Douglas Int'l Airport.  Was greeted immediately and led to a table.  Pleasant service and good ambiance to kill some time and fill that hungry tummy.  Service was fast and food came out briskly after I ordered.  The Bacon Cheeseburger was excellent!  But why give it 3 stars?!?! Even though the food came out quickly, someway, somehow, the food was COLD. I have no idea why but it was cold.  Due to the short layover time and just cannot missed the next flight, I downed it like a champ!  The bun was cold along with the cold fixins' didn't help either.  But the first thing I put in my mouth was the side of sweet potato fries...first bite...dissapointment...again...It was COLD.    The burger had everything a burger enthusiast wants.  Meat, bacon, cheese, more bacon, and the regular fixins,' oh, and MORE bacon...6 slices to be exact!  I added an overeasy egg and some avocado to top it off.  The combinations of flavors were good and the meat patty was cooked to order, not any rarer or well done.     Sweet potato fries were seasoned nicely and came with a side dip of chipotle ranch.    It actually is a decent place to eat and the portions are excellent for an airport establishment.  Hope the next time I give it another chance and the food comes out a bit warmer..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our food here. We went during a busy lunch time, but our service was good. We were seated quickly and orders were taken appropriately. We appreciated the gluten free options, as my daughter has celiac disease. She got a burger with avocado and gluten free bun. I got the black bean burger (vegan options are very minimal) with added mushrooms and fries for both of us.  It was all very good. A bit pricey but I do recommend."}
{"text":"Wow no words to describe every bite was awesome and our waitress Chelsea was amazing. You can't go wrong with anything you get."}
{"text":"This is a place that isn't super cheap, but the food makes up for the price. The turkey burger was AAAAMAZING. I did a build your own burger w/ a lettuce wrap. I didn't expect just a hunk of lettuce with the burger on top, but the turkey burger itself made up for it. Service was great and the sweet potato fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"COMA: a state of mental or physical sluggishness  As I reflect on my experience at Bad Daddy's Burger Bar today for lunch, one word keeps coming to mind - \"COMA\".  Maybe because I am still feeling somewhat mentally and physically sluggish still some 5 hours later.  But that's probably because the burger I ordered - The Cantina, was simply magnificent, leaving me totally satisfied and full.   As I stated, I ordered the Cantina Burger, my date ordered the Mama Ricatta's Burger.  Both were filled with juicy deliciousness.  I would like to point out a few things specific to my order: I added bacon, guacamole, grilled onions, BBQ sauce, and garlic mayo to my burger.  Also, instead of the veggie burger patty, I changed it to a beef patty - medium rare.  Upon placing my order, i wasn't worried about how it all would come together taste-wise, you probably could out dirt and grass on one of their burgers and it would be great.   I was a little worried how it would all physically stay intact and in some resemblance of a burger. Half-way through my burger I marveled at how it all manged to remained together throughout the massacre that took place this afternoon.   Upon receiving my burger, all I could do was simply stare at it for a few moments, and give my stomach a chance to wrap its lining around what it was going to have to digest in the next few moments.  Upon taking a few pics for all my yelp-peeps, I placed the sandwich together and dug right in.  As for the actual taste of the burger, as I stated it was juicy, not overcooked or dry.  The beef patty tasted close to something you would get at a cookout in the backyard.  A generous helping of cheese, veggies and condiments accompanied the burger as well.  I like that they don't put the burger together for you, so you can take off, or put on anything you want (that's what she said, lol).  Upon getting about half-through my burger, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the bun held up with all the extras I had on it.  I ordered fries with my burger which were awesome and everything you could want hand-cut fries to be.  My date ordered the tater tots which she loved.  They were savory indeed, and both tasted even better when dipped in the signature Bad Daddy's sauce.  Burger = Awesome. Fries = Amazing.  Service = Spectacular.  Feeling Afterwards = Coma."}
{"text":"I'm always ready for a nap after leaving here. A blissful, curled up on the sofa nap. The burgers are awesome. I'm not big on beef so I appreciate the options for turkey, chicken, and veggie. My favorite burger here is the Mama Ricotta's with a turkey patty. Their sweet potato fries are among the best I've ever had.  On the downside, there's not a lot of parking at this location. During peak times, you could be circling around for a few laps."}
{"text":"Best black bean burger ever in life, get the onion sticks instead of fries. Always crowded but really delicious. There salads topped with a burger are pretty good!"}
{"text":"Food was good! Service was excellent and fairly quick! It's pretty great for an airport restaurant, I recommend stopping by if you have a connection in CLT!"}
{"text":"This place became a favorite of mine on my very first visit. I don't live in Charlotte, but when I visit, I'll be dropping in for a delicious burger! I've had the \"Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids, and the Kobe burger, both were equally good! If you appreciate and enjoy a well made burger, and I mean tasty good burgers, then Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is the place to be! I can't wait to return to Charlotte, and try more of their creative tasty burgers!"}
{"text":"Big Daddy's Burgers in Ballantyne across from the Ballantyne Hotel serves an excellent breakfast on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  I recommend the \"average joe\" breakfast with 3 eggs, biscuit, potatoes and bacon, plus you do not have to wait for a fashionable hour for them to open; they open at 8:00 AM on the weekends.  Except for here and John's on Central not many other Charlotte restaurant know how to do an early morning breakfast. At lunch their burgers and fries are just as good as their other spot on East Blvd."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I chose this spot for breakfast on a Sunday morning at Charlotte's airport, which has seemingly large dining choices.    In any case I was craving breakfast, and when I think of Charlotte I think of some decent home cooking.  Sadly the meal and service at Bad Daddy's was the quintessential bad \"airport terminal\" dining that one dreads - large bland overpriced portions not cooked that well, with slow service.    The bartender seemed cool enough, but even though his bar wasn't busy, or the dining room, the room capacity looked pretty large.   Whatever the case, it seemed like my scrambled eggs and bacon took close to 30 minutes to arrive, which is uncomfortable when you have a connecting flight. The woman next to me had to ask for hers to go.  For $12 I expect a decent egg and bacon breakfast, but the bacon was to my misfortune burnt and tasteless, the eggs rubbery and bland, with the highlight being the fried potato squares.  It was a massive portion of subpar food.    I would definitely try not to eat there again unless I wanted those fried potatoes.  The bar was pretty cozy too.  Sorry Bad Daddy.  It was bad, Daddy."}
{"text":"Ordered the special, Pacos Burger medium rare, and it was perfection: juicy, melt in your mouth tender, and the delicious southwestern toppings made it the best burger I've had all year.  Also a fan of the long-sliced fried pickles and the seasoned brown fries with sweet BBQ dipping sauce."}
{"text":"We typically don't care to eat in airport restaurants when we travel because of the high cost and (our experience) lower quality, unless we are absolutely starving.  However, after a nightmare travel day, which wasn't over yet, we really needed food and beer.  We debated where to go, not familiar with anything, and decided a burger bar seemed like the best idea.    First, CLT was insanely packed even at 8pm on a Sunday evening when we were there.  Flights left and right were delayed or cancelled due to weather, so stranded and semi-stranded passengers crowded into every restaurant.  We waited about 10-15 minutes for a table.  It's a cool place, has good ambiance and decor, fun, laid back, good music playing.  Our waiter greeted us promptly, apologizing in advance for any slow service we received, as they were busier than normal.    Only a few beers on tap, and it figured they were out of Goose Island, which is what I wanted.  Oh well, Stella Artois is a great second choice.  He got us our beers in good time.  They have a nice assortment of burgers.  I went plain and simple and it really was delicious.  Cooked fully but not dry.  Excellent fries.  I don't know if it was 12 hours of travel with just airline pretzels in my stomach, or not, but the burger was dang good!  My husband liked his as well.  As you'd expect in an airport, alcohol prices were astronomical.  $10 for a draught beer.  Worth it after the day we'd had, though!  Food prices didn't seem quite as painful, a little better than you might expect at an airport.  Our server was very busy but did a great job keeping friendly, positive, and as attentive as he could be.  I only saw a small handful of servers, and they didn't seem to stop for a second!    Having a positive experience at this place as busy as it was tells me it's probably a good choice anytime.  It'll have its bad moments, sure (there will always be bad days/moments/experiences), but I would eat there again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Great food. Great Burgers. Great service. A little busy, but to be expected in Birkdale village of course!"}
{"text":"We have visited Bad Daddy at the airport and Birkdale which we normally go to, everyone having a good experience.. Wish we would of tonight as well. Went to the new location by concord mills and was so disappointed I may not return. Sat down around quarter to 5 on a Wednesday.. and nothing. No server no drinks nothing. Restaurant was not overly busy.. maybe 1/3 full. Finally what we think was a manager came over around 5 and took a drink order. Water came and we waited another 10 minutes before we got the attention of another server to ask if we could get served. We watched them dilerbate for another minute or two before someone came over and said they would not be our server.. that they were on a shift change and she would take our order. I've worked in the food service industry for 15 years and in service overall for 25.. and you would never tell customers that. Also if you had a proper front of the house schedule with 2 to 3 mid servers and staggered entries for the night shift that wouldn't happen either. Finally get our food almost 45 minutes after we got there.. wife's burger was luke warm.  By this time we are so disappointed we pay and leave. Just an awful experience.. and extremely disappointing considering the food is so good. Get it together Bad Daddy concord.. or let me know if you need a manager."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is AWESOME!!  Great atmosphere and totally yummy food.  Highly recommend the \"Sam I Am\" burger paired with the straw onion rings.   The banana pudding is insanely addictive.    Burgers are a little pricey but well worth every cent!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Bad Daddy's. Really good burgers with a lot of variety if you are looking for something beyond a classic cheese burger. They always have a good tap list with local beers.   Friendly and helpful staff. The East Blvd location is also very kid friendly with plenty of highchairs and a decent kid's menu.  My only complaint is the bathroom was beyond dirty with a leaking toilet and paper towels all over the floor. The table was also very sticky which is pretty gross when you are eating dinner. Would have given a higher rating if it was more clean."}
{"text":"Great burger, i ordered the cheeseburger on steroids. I got the tater tots which were outstanding."}
{"text":"Love every burger I've ever had here! The only reason I. Giving it 4 stars instead of five is because the service can be kinda slow sometimes. Other than that it's great! The decor is cool and the sweet potato fries are amazing! Definitely stop by if you're in the Dilworth area"}
{"text":"This place is pretty terrible - in a sea of awful restaurants at the CHARLOTTE airport.    Burgers are over salted and not cooked the way it is ordered    Probably better off getting pre-prepared food at Wolfgang Pucks or elsewhere.  Service is OK, as long as you're willing to flag down the staff (they have too many table ).  At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Turkey burger was good, not sure it was worth $10, but I did enjoy it.  My friend ordered fried pickles, and they were yum!  Will probably go back someday."}
{"text":"While I have to say the food in this place is consistently good, the service and prices leave me wondering why it is so popular. The last time we ate here, I ordered a fried pickle appetizer, which is around $7 on the menu, and received about 8 pieces in the basket. Our total bill (no alcohol) came to $80 (for a family of 5) which seems overpriced for burgers, no matter how good they are. The place is crowded, and the wait staff seems most interested in getting you out the door as quickly as possible, and not really providing good service. Again, no  issues with the food, but I think I will stick with 5-Guys from now on so I don't have to deal with a surly wait staff and an overpriced meal."}
{"text":"The best airport burger I've ever had.  Good service.  Great crispy tater tots.  Built my own burger with Brie and bacon...the bacon was wonderfully well done."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to one of their locations, but never got to. Now, they are way too close to my house and business is boomin'.   I went on a Wednesday afternoon, and it was still pretty busy at that time (I can't imagine how busy it is for dinner). I'm not a huge burger person, but they have the potential of changing my views. I got the Magic Mushroom. There weren't as many mushrooms as the description made it seem like there were, so that disappointed me a bit. The meat patty was so tender and juicy, it was great. It was seasoned extremely well and went great with the aioli. I got a side of tater tots and that was a great decision. It was super crunchy and oil didn't run off onto your fingers like how many other served tater tots are. Overall, the entire dish wasn't too oily and I really liked that. I didn't feel like I was slobbered in oil and grease after finishing my meal.   Our waitress was friendly, but people who work here rarely smile. For a place that is so upbeat and hip, the employees should be comparable and not appear so stressed and unhappy."}
{"text":"I had garlic chicken wings, which sounded appealing to me. I have never had greasier wings- and I've had a lot of wings in my life. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"The last time I came the food was so good I knew I had to go back, so I went for dinner last night. Had the BBQ chicken nachos for an appetizer and it was worth it for sure. With a recommendation from the super friendly (and very pretty ) waitress I ordered the Super Bacon Cheeseburger and Truffle Parmesan fries. First off - the fries were excellent. Seriously these were some of the best fries I can remember eating in a long, long time.   Now for the burger.   I ordered it medium rare (as I do everywhere that serves it that way), but I'm fairly certain it was rare. Like - rare rare. Regardless I ate it....and it was still pretty good, but if it was cooked right I really think it would have been as tasty as the burger I had the first time I came here.   Mistake on the burger, AWESOME fries, good beer (two hearted ale), and really friendly staff. I'll give it 4 stars....but I'll update it to 5 if my burger is cooked right next time I go.  Oh, and if you go don't pass up the BBQ chicken Nachos"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service was top notch the black bean burger was amazing.  The drink specials were well prepared.  And the Tatar tots were wonderful.  I wish it was twice its size so there wasn't always a line.  Wonderful addition to Concord mills area"}
{"text":"We've been here four times now, and I will say, I love the burgers. Momma Ricotta's Burger is SO GOOD! The house-made potato chips are amazing too! This is our go-to spot for great burgers, at decent prices.  I would give this 5 stars, but the only drawback to this place is the service. It always starts strong, but peters out at the end. We only plan to go when we have time to sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Umm....the most delicious turkey burger I have ever had.  Still not convinced it was turkey.  I really liked this place a lot, definitely not a place to visit if you are trying to stick to a diet though.  They have KILLER tots!"}
{"text":"Damn dude. I love this place. I don't even know what else to say.   Yeah, that's really it. Awesome. If you're any kind of \"health nut\" or typical \"Lake Norman-ite\" than sure, you're going to complain about the size and calorie content of these burgers.. but then don't go to a burger place.   And I've always had great, quick, service - their staff seems to always be on point."}
{"text":"Best airport food ever! I got the mushroom burger (it has a cutesy name I can't recall) and it was cooked perfectly to medium, as requested. My boyfriend got the bacon burger on steroids and it had so much delicious bacon on it he had to take some off to fit it in his mouth.  His came with applewood smoked bacon and jalapeño bacon, both of which were very unique and tasty. Both of our meals came with a very healthy portion of fries and amazing barbecue sauce! It was tangy and smoky; I wish I could have taken a bottle home! We asked our server for a side of truffle aioli that normally came with the appetizer truffle Parmesan fries. She said she had to check with a manager but after a few minutes said it wasn't on the cash register and her manager said if they couldn't charge for it, they couldn't serve it. Luckily, her manager wasn't there so she hooked it up! Awesome, fast service and reasonable prices, for an airport. Our whole meal with a lemonade & a bud light came out to $43. If I ever get laid over at CLT I know where I'll be dining!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. A bit pricey but on par with other airport eateries. Service was kind of lacking."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This was the best burger I have had in a very long time, if ever. We wanted to grab a bite before our late flight, so we splurged and ate at the airport. Place was packed, but our waitress was still very attentive. Too bad I do not live in the area because I would be back for sure."}
{"text":"After a day of travel that consisted of dead end after dead end, the burger bar was the perfect haven. Our server greeted us quickly and so did our drinks! We started off with the garlic wings that come with a peanut soy dipping sauce, DELISH. I then stuck with a basic burger with pepperjack cheese, bad daddy sauce and sweet potato fries. Amazing. My burger was cooked just as I had asked. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheeseburger on steroids. Yes, that's what it's really called. This would probably be a must for any bacon lover. Why? Because it comes with three different kinds of bacon.   Overall, I would definitely go back. If you find yourself hungry in the Charlotte airport stop here for a satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's has become a go-to place for us when we're not in the mood for cooking or hosting an out-of-town guest. I've tried many burgers around Charlotte, but my favorite is the Sam I Am Burger here. It is the one I order the most, but other favorites include the Bad Ass Burger, the Pittsburgher, and the Western Burger. I can't remember a time I've been that the burger wasn't cooked exactly how I ordered it (which is harder to find than you may imagine). We have also always received great service when at Bad Daddy's."}
{"text":"Please note - this is 4 stars in airport restaurant world. It's clean, service is pretty fast, and the food is good. They have the best fried pickles and tater tots!  If I have a layover in CLT, I normally try to stop here for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"One thing I don't like about Charlotte Douglas Airport are the dining options.  You have Chilis Too and Taquileria in the Atrium, and then if you're flying out of C you have Bad Daddy's or Philips Seafood.  Of those options this is the place I choose to eat.  I haven't been back to Chilis Too or Taquileria since this place opened.  I get the popeye for breakfast and have a good start to my trip.    To go service was slow a couple times when I used it.  I had 15 minutes before I was boarding at the gate next door and got my food with about 2 minutes to spare.  It was hot and fresh, but still seemed to take longer than an omelet should.  I don't fly out of C very often at lunch time and it's not good enough to walk across the airport just to eat here, but for lunch it is a toss up between Philips Seafood or here."}
{"text":"Solid burgers, solid service, good beer selection, amazing sweet potato fries, and great location are just a few of the factors that keep me coming back to Bad Daddy's time and time again.   I'm not a vegetarian, but I often order their black bean burger because it is \"slap me in the face\" good! I've also had several of their salads, and really like the Gigante Tuna salad -who knew gigante beans paired so well with seared tuna?  I've never been disappointed with Bad Daddy's, my only complaint is that the place is pretty small and the main dining area is quite narrow. The cramped space makes me a bit claustrophobic, so I usually try to sit on the patio so that I don't feel as cramped.   The service is attentive, but I've had a few instances where I've asked to have things such as my salad dressing on the side or to have a lettuce wrap on my burger instead of a bun and the order has come out incorrect -none of that is a big deal, but lesson learned -I always confirm that the server remembers my modifications.  Bad Daddy's is our go-to burger spot, because it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here on my recent trip through Charlotte. Both my husband and I ordered burgers. I had the sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious. I am particularly a fan of the number of sauces they have. I also got a blood mary and it was delicious. It is very easy to ruin a bloody mary and this one was top notch. I will definitely be back on my next visit to/through Charlotte."}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable I had the bison burger with fried egg on top sauteed onions lettuce and tomato with my with white cheddar cheese it was so delicious I will be going back and I had a sweet potato fries excellent & crispy. This place can become habitual. But I have to watch it... but its good comfort food and the service was great."}
{"text":"Basic Burger patty was frozen (medium well was gray and hot, but still squishy. Know what I mean?).  Stopped in between flights at 7pm. Fries were cold. Come on, guys!!  I'll gladly pay, especially when trapped in an airport, an extra buck for hot fries. Throw them out, for Pete's sake, when they time out!  But the beer was good (can't mess that up) and the view against the window of ground ops at C6 is worth it!  So go, but pay for the premium patty."}
{"text":"You have to be strategic about when you go or not mind waiting in a parking lot for at least an hour - but it's worth it. There is limited parking and it is a small location, which is the case for most restaurants on this street. There is indoor and covered/enclosed outdoor seating. Despite the small space, you don't feel cramped once you're seated. If you're going with a group of 6 or more, try to get a table outside. If you enjoy drinks, check out their weekly features before you head out (like Mug Night on Wednesdays - bring your own mug up to 40 oz and get beers for $4-$6). You can build your own burger or order one of their custom creations. As an added treat, they have both regular and adult (spiked) milkshakes.  Food: they have many different types of patties and buns to choose from, I especially enjoy the bacon beef patty. I was disappointed in the buttermilk battered bacon - too much breading for a regular bacon slice. Still, their tots are delicious, their burgers are very tasty, and their milkshakes are just the right way to top it off. The grasshopper milkshake was a bit disappointing but the Snickers milkshake is very tasty.   Like most burger places, there are plenty of tvs to keep you up to date on news and sports. There is a bar but it's a tight fit against the tables. If you need extra parking, check the lot to the left of the shop, there is a road/parking area that cuts around the neighboring business and you can sometimes score a spot there without having to drive further away."}
{"text":"I can see why there is always a line. The yelp reviews don't lie. These burgers are up there with Bang Bang huge full flavor and pipping hot. My family all ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger on steroids and wow all that bacon by itself was a meal. The patty was thick and juicy and the versions kinds of bacon make it the perfect marriage. I was able to eat my in one sitting but my son aka \"The Stomach\" tapped out early. Definitely add this to your list of places to try for a good burger and service. This place makes Red Robin's premium burgers look .99 cent parties."}
{"text":"Best burger spot in town. Milkshakes are quite spectacular as well. Go with the western burger with a side of tots."}
{"text":"Great burger bar. Priced right and enough good food on the plate.   Being more of a sports bar it's not the quietist place but not a real problem. Adequate staff and they do pay attention. Whim your soda gets low you get a new one they don't pour more soda into an old soda that's go e flat or watered down."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Excellent music! Juicy burgers. Great service! Generous portions! Must try sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"The burgers here are great! I have also gotten a build your own salad which was pretty good but not worth $12, I will be sticking to the burgers from now on. This place is pretty pricy for a burger but it won't stop me from going every now and then. Good food, good people."}
{"text":"Great bar service and the food comes out fast! Tater totes and beer is the way to go if you only have an hour delay. Spicy brown honey mustard has a great kick to it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  Very friendly waitress who explained the whole concept to us. The side dishes were great. Quality of the food was note worthy. Wife got the lentil burger, which was a bit lacking in flavor. My burger with the fried bacon was very filling--but it did take away from the overall flavor of the burger.  Will definitely comeback here... This and COWFISH are the best burgers in CLT (sorry, Liberty)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Asian salad and and a local beer while on a layover."}
{"text":"Bad service. Super slow for airport, no ketchup but it's a fry and burger joint. Fries are good."}
{"text":"Love this place; best burger in Charlotte, good drinks specials, amazing fried pickles and the milkshakes are easily the best I've had. The spiked shakes offer a cool twist and the place is finished off with good friendly service. My only complaint is how popular this place is, in winter usually there's a wait for the table but in summer the al fresco seating helps to reduce the wait.  Moving round the corner soon so this place is going to become our local, could be dangerous!"}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting, everything was delicious!  My husband got the Bad Ass burger, it was AMAZING! I had the Frenchie with sweet potato fries, it was delicious!   We also shared the dried pickle, which were amazing as well! Service was good and food came out fast!   I can't wait to visit charlotte again, this will definitely be the first place we eat at when we visit again!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with my experience here. I came running in at the last minute just before they closed, and a waitress immediately took my order and got my food to me quickly. Best of all, food was good and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this burger place and I decided to check it out for dinner one day. I decided to get the Emilio's Chicken Sandwich. This is a buttermilk fried chicken breast topped with guacamole, jalapeno bacon, onions, tomato, lettuce, mozzarella and poblano pepper mayo. With the sandwich I got a side of fries. The chicken sandwich is unique and it mixes different flavors and they seem to go well together. The chicken is cooked well. To be completely honest I wasn't very impressed with the sandwich. I feel like it had all the right ingredients but the flavors didn't come through in the sandwich. The one impressive ingredient in the sandwich was the poblano pepper mayo. It was unique and tasted really good. The fries were good but nothing special. I have tired some of the other things there and I would recommend eating there starters before getting a sandwich. Also, I would recommend trying the chipotle ranch dipping sauce. The chipotle ranch is one of my favorite dips to have with their fries. Overall a sandwich, fries, and a drink will run you about $13."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had.    I try to eat reasonably healthy so when I splurge it is always a disappointment when the food isn't great.  Boy was I glad I ordered food from here.  You must try it!  I wish I had a photo but I was starving and it was so good that I just gobbled it up."}
{"text":"Love a great burger and this spot has that plus a beer list to keep you busy too! Went for a burger with pimento cheese (I am such a pimento cheese fan) and a Prost Pills. I did a 'make your own salad' for a side and it was fun to choose what I wanted. I guess I love to customize.  This place has a lot of personality and attracts a good crowd. The neighborhood is a lot of fun to walk around too.   side note: had a burger and fries at the airport version of Bad Daddys and it wasn't as good as this original spot but definitely good. I wouldn't normally eat that much before a flight but had to give it one more shot."}
{"text":"The always busy Bad Daddy's is a solid choice in the Ballentyne area. Good burgers including one of the best black bean burgers in town. The fried pickles are good... Not as good as Alexander Michaels but worth a try. I prefer the sweet potato fries to the regular ones. Also the buffalo burger is an interesting choice. Worth a try..."}
{"text":"I do not think that it possible to have better customer service, other restaurants should come and study the business model.  The fact all the burgers are so customizable is great, I have never had a bad meal at the Ballantyne store.  The only thing is that I wish they would expand the dessert menu, though the options are good I love a decadent chocolate dessert. Please make this a place to go to. Oh, I forgot to mention the beer selection is worth a visit as well."}
{"text":"First I want to qualify that my 4 stars are more for the service and specials than for the food. The lines are ridiculous at any new restaurant in the area so get used to it and quit complaining about long wait times, do as we do, when you drive up see a line out the door, drive away and come back another day.  So we have found ourselves at Bad Daddy's on a couple of occasions (between rush hours) and really enjoy the vibe inside. Both of our experiences were sitting at the bar where we could watch sports and the service was spot on each time.   The menu is pretty extensive with custom burgers ranging from 7oz to 10oz patties and toppings galore, non burger options and salads. Honestly I prefer a basic burger with select toppings and with Bad Daddy's custom burger menu you can order just what you want.  On this day we started with the truffle fries with some kind of wicked good Aioli dipping sauce (go ahead and ask for 2 when you order, stuff is addicting), but after a few $3 NC beers on special (Thursday get local pints for $3, half the price for same beer at the local brewery) we decided go for the Patty Melt on Brioche bun instead of Rye.  The bun was rich and chewy and holds up well to the litany of toppings on a BD Burger, while the meat itself could use a bit of seasoning as it was very bland.    Descent selection of beers on tap with about half being local Carolina brews, Thursday $3 local pints, Monday 20oz for the price of a pint, & $5 Bloody Mary's on the weekend, and they have a patio (but no TV on said patio, this is a Big MISS!)  Food: 3.5 Sporks Service:  4.5 Sporks Atmosphere: 4.5 Sporks Local Beer: 4 Sporks Value: 3.5 Sporks"}
{"text":"Came here in a busy Saturday afternoon. Sat at the bar in hopes we could catch some college football while eating. The bartender was nice and as attentive as she could be while being the only bartender and constantly making shakes. The spot would of been ok if it wasn't right beside the open kitchen door  (that had a lot going on/loud) . We started off with the bacon queso. It was hot and delicious. Next I had the patty melt with sweet potatoe fries. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and it was very flavorful. Always a plus with ordering sweet potato fries is that it comes with a special sauce( I hate when it doesn't). They had one that was so good! Wanted to dip  everything in it. I would defiantly come here again, but skip the bar unless you want to hear and see all the ins and outs of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte on a business trip, and flying out I had some time to grab some dinner before my flight. This is the best food I've ever had in an airport. ever. That said, now that I see it is a chain that exists in other locations as well, I would definitely check it out if I were in Charlotte again.  I had the Sam I Am burger, because I never turn down a burger with egg on it =). While the pesto flavour was really weak, the whole package was amazingly delicious! Loved every bite of it. The fries were really good too. The service was good and quick when we were there, and didn't have to worry about catching our flight or anything."}
{"text":"My family & I have always enjoyed Bad Daddy's. Every location that we have been to. Service is always exceptional. The ONLY reason why I decided to come leave a yelp review is for 1. My husband & I ate the same exact thing and have been sick for the past 12 hours. 2. I was kind of anxious to see if anyone else had left a review about food poisoning.  My husband and I sat at the bar - ordered ourselves Mich Ultras while we waited for our to go order to be placed. We received it rather quickly- took it home. (About a 25 minute drive) we ordered the burger on steroids - WELL. (Bartender/waitress) noted that the burger would be a slight pink. It was not that. It was more medium than anything. (Just noting it wasn't what we ordered) REGARDLESS - that wouldn't have gotten us sick - the improper food handling will. So getting back to the reason for the review - along with feeling awful might I mention we are Forced to have to pack an entire house in a couple of days because we are moving at the end of the week - makes our day miserable and are so disappointed in the meal in general. Might I also add - we had order 2 of the Elvis milkshakes - for the kids on the ride home - Never received but that was the least of our worries."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here tonight!  Our waitress was great, food was on point!  We enjoyed watching the Saints and Vikings!  Such a great experience!  Sorry didn't take pics, but was so engrossed in eating my turkey burger and fries."}
{"text":"Yeeeees hunny! This hit the spot! The Black Bean Burger... Crispy... And with bacon (Don't judge me, I'm not vegetarian).   The avocado, chipotle sauce, Monterrey cheese, and the tasty patty with all the fixins was on point. I got the tater tots with it. And they were aight. Brought me back to high school, when I popped these in the oven for a snack... I used to put cheese on mine. I digress...  We got there at like 9:30 pm (the close at 11), and the waitress was still attentive, not acting like she wanted to go home. The food came out fast and it was fresh and hot. I gobbled my food down in like 10 minutes... No lie. If that doesn't tell you how good it is, I don't know what will.    All in all, service was good and the burger was jumpin!"}
{"text":"I been here numerous times. This place is as close to my favorite burger joint (Kopp's) in Milwaukee, WI. Definitely help me out when I miss Kopp's burgers. First time there I orders the Badass Burgers. I literally ate 3/4 of it. It was huge. A two 5oz ground beef & bacon patties with lettuce, tomato, buttermilk fried bacon, horseradish mayo, and an artisanal white cheddar cheese. Omg. I literally almost pass out. It was sooo good and juicy. Couple other times I ordered just the cheeseburger. Than recently I ordered the Frenchie, which is a turkey burger w.brie and apples. I like it but overall prefer their cheeseburger. I love their tator tots. Not salty and just right. Customer service is alway on point. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great burgers! It's an amazing experience!! The burgers are huge and you should definitely come with a big appetite. Not for those who get full so easily."}
{"text":"After being contacted by the regional manager of the store to address our concerns, my wife and I went back to the restaurant. It was like night and day. The food and service were much improved and we would both recommend the place as a solid choice for a good burger!"}
{"text":"The Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids is one of the best burgers I've had in a while. Next time, I'm trying the Bad Ass Burger.   The prices are reasonable & the service was pretty good although the waitress didn't come back to the table to refill my drink. It was pretty crowded & without some sort of waiting area...you had the option of going outside or stand around the front entrance.     Another issue is the terrible parking! The parking area is so small and too cramped. With the amount of money the business is making...they should invest in a bigger spot with ample parking...just saying ."}
{"text":"The Sam I am burger is my go to. Love the sauce they give you with tater tots. Was close to closing time and they were still really friendly, last experiences folks try to rush you out) they didn't and would still come over and talk to us and see how we were doing. This is a fairly new place in the concord area and if they keep this up they will probably be around for a long time."}
{"text":"Had lunch here traveling from PA to TX.  It's airport food so didn't have high hopes to begin with.  Service was Ok but my burger was so dry and well done, which is not how I ordered it.  I ate half of it and gave up.  The fries were OK but some had a ton of their seasoning on them which was too salty so I kind of just ate the fries with the least amount of seasoning.  Overall the food served it's purpose and I was no longer hungry but it was not great and I would be perfectly fine going the rest of my life without eating at another one of these restaurants again."}
{"text":"If I want a burger I WANT bad daddy's!  I don't often crave red meat but I'm telling you if I do this is my jam. I have also had their chicken sand and nachos which were also delicious. Their potato puffs and the dip that is served with them is seriously sinful (and a bit spicy;). My mom and I stopped in before a movie to kill 30 min and split the banana pudding and that was also crazy good.  Gets busy at dinner time on the weekends especially."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food. Reasonably priced. Great service. I make it a point to visit every time I come to Charlotte. You won't find a better burger joint, and their breakfast food is ridiculously scrumptious too."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is awesome. I appreciate a good burger joint that also has decent salads and other options. Everyone in our group found something they were satisfied with. The Texican Chicken Salad is the best."}
{"text":"Burger patty was tough, dry, and lacked flavor.  Tater tots with egg and cheese were excellent.  The atmosphere is great,  however the burger left me disappointed."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight after traveling from Raleigh. We just have to rave about our server Nathan.  He was awesome! We were his last table of the night and he was very tentative and observant.  Our drinks never went empty, our food was hot and correct (also thanks to the kitchen for that), was polite, waited until we were both finished eating before bringing our check so as to not make us feel rushed. He just did everything right and we wish there were more servers like him. What was more impressive was that while taking care of us he was also stocking up, sweeping, taking out trash, just doing things that needed to be done without missing a beat. We made sure to let the manager know how great a job he did.  The kitchen did a great job as well. Our food came out hot and in a timely manner. I ordered my burger well done and it was cooked perfectly...not overdone or burnt at all. And my husbands veggie burger was fried instead of grilled which is a great option that more places who offer veggie burgers should do since it keeps it from being mushy (also a suggestion from our server).  Everyone we encountered was nice and we enjoyed our experience here.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"God I love Bad Daddy's (or Big Daddy's, as I remember it).  What I love more is to tease my brother every time that I'm here because this is one of his favorite places to dine when he's in town from Kansas. This place has something for everyone and is a great place to come for a beer, cocktail, with the family or just for a casual, quick meal. I love the milkshakes and turkey burger which has brie cheese and apple. I cannot ever come without getting an order of the tator tots with their special sauce. This place is a winner!!"}
{"text":"If you love messy, good finger lickin food, Daddy's is the place to go!  You know it's good when there is a roll of paper towels on every table!  We started by having the nachos for an app, for free! (If you sign up For their email subscription, you get one for free!)  I then had the build your own burger (chicken burger, guac, grilled onion, with horse-radish sauce).  And it was sloppy and yummy! Just the way I like my food!    Definitely fun for all ages! If you time it right, you might even see a NASCAR driver there too! Out of respect of him, I won't say who... But one of the drivers walked in and had lunch with his family. And no one even bugged him. It was great!   A quick tip, the blue cheese on the salad is STRONG... My wife loves blue cheese, and it was even to strong for her.  Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast.  Standard fare, but reasonable well prepared.  Service lacks.  I had eggs with cheese, nice thick bacon potatoes, toast coffee.  Ice in OJ was a negative as was service, never came to check and they didn't put butter, and then took too long to come back for check.  Left cash, waitress missed out on a larger tip."}
{"text":"The burgers are soft--almost as if they were steamed. The onion straws have cayenne or too much pepper in the batter. The music is ridiculously loud--who wants to be blasted on a Sunday morning? And the service is inconsistent--attention, but then the waitperson disappears. Charlotte doesn't have a lot of choices, but next time I'll go back to the barbecue place or the sushi bar."}
{"text":"The actually restaurant on east blvd. is much better than the restaurant at the airport, but the product is close enough. The only reason I would ever return to Charlotte is for these burgers!!!!"}
{"text":"9:45 am. Monday morning. After standing at the host stand and observing 5 different wait staff walking by without greeting me I opted to eat elsewhere.  4 additional wait staff were socializing behind the bar ignoring customers. This speaks to the expectations actions of management. I can't review the breakfast because I left.  Service below 0."}
{"text":"We needed to eat late after a craft show in Charlotte. It was almost 11:00pm on a Saturday and they were getting ready to close. The staff happily accommodated us and cooked us two delicious burgers and fries to go. We enjoyed a beer while waiting. Food was great, waitstaff excellent. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I rather enjoyed my meal at BDBB.  Our table shared some starters, including the garlic wings, homestyle potato chips, tater tots, french fries, and sweet potato fries.  So yes, a lot of carbs. They were all done well, fried just right to the perfect crisp without being soggy or greasy.  The wings were seasoned well, with plenty of garlic and the perfect amount of salt.  I felt bad for the people sitting next to me on the plane that night though.  With some guilt from all the carbs, I opted for Chicken Club burger instead of beef.  It wasn't that much healthier since it had bacon.  I can't resist bacon.  The burger had a good mix of flavor and was juicy.   It was a decent size, but after the wings and potatoes, I almost couldn't finish it.    Service was friendly and prices were in line with all other airport dining facilities.  I will definitely eat here again the next time I'm at the airport."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. They can carry a crowd so you may have to wait for a table.   I had the mushroom burger and subbed for a turkey patty. It was delicious. The regular and sweet potato fries leave something to be desired.   My partner had the chicken club and it was so good.  We also had delicious garlic wings that come with a peanut sauce and ranch.   If you're in a rush I wouldn't recommend going here. The food takes a while to come out. We were on a long layover so it worked well for us. If I didn't have a lot of time I probably would've been annoyed.   Also our server, Aubrey, was very nice and attentive even though she was busy. She's the reason for the 4th star."}
{"text":"I had a hard time clicking 4 stars for this place since it is in an airport...but MAN...it really is that good!!  Keep in mind, that this is a burger place primarily.  If you come here, you need to get a burger.  They have many options including a build your own.  They also have Patty alternatives to their normal ones such as Turkey, Black Bean and even American Kobe.  I had the Western burger which came with bacon, onion strings, a spicy cheese that I cannot recall (possibly pepper jack) and BBQ sauce on the side.  I also got the tater tots as my side based on a recommendation from some locals near us.  The tots did not disappoint!  They were amazing, especially dipped in their secret Bad Daddy sauce which actually was a highlight for me here.  The burger was cooked perfectly and really delicious.  If I am even caught in a layover in Charlotte again...I'm coming here for sure!"}
{"text":"You have to try the texican salad! SOOO good!"}
{"text":"Stopped at their place in Charlotte airport. The food was great, service was great.  Menu selection was also great. Lot of choices. I had the western burger and it was awesome. Fries were crispy. Came with a special spicy sauce. Bbq sauce came on it. I would definitely go back again if I stop by that airport again."}
{"text":"Good food. House made American cheese is so-so. Good burgers and nice place. A little expensive for what you get"}
{"text":"I usually eat at the sushi bar in CLT, however, on this day I was stressed from work and really wanted a cheese burger, the largest cheese burger I could find! I saw Bad Daddy's and made a B-line for the hostess stand. The waiter took a while to get to me. I ordered a glass of red conundrum and a water, I never got the water. My food came about 20 min later. My waiter never came by to check on me again (no, they were not busy), and I literally had to chase him down to pay my bill which was highly annoying considering I was on a layover (as I'm sure most people were), so I didn't want to sit in there for 1.5hrs. As far as the food, the fries were mushy (gross), and the burger did not come how I asked for it. And frankly, the burger wasn't that great, I make better one's at home, with better quality buns, especially for their prices! I will definitely not be returning. I'll stick to the sushi bar and better wine selection in the common area between the terminals."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service. Fantastic options, veggie burgers included. Nice sized patio.  How do you get your out-of-town friends to visit again? Take them to Big Daddy's! I thought I was impressing my friend by taking her all over almost every Charlotte neighborhood, but it wasn't until lunchtime with a hamburger in hand did she start to really sing praises. The burger was perfect, the fries were great.   One of the managers came out to say hello and chatted a minute about being from Texas. I thought that was really friendly and created a personal connection.   Thanks, Big Daddy, for taking the delicious measures to ensure the return of my friend to the Queen City!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for a morning egg scramble, but I guess that's to be expected in an airport. The scramble itself was overly greasy considering what I ordered didn't contain any meat in it. Two major issues that arise are that for one the service was extremely slow, a turn around of 45 minutes from Hello to Goodbye, something they need to address since their customer base have flights to catch. The other issue is that my waitress Kristen was completely vacant and unfriendly which culminated into placing BDBB's into my no fly zone."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is in the top 5 places to get a great burger in Charlotte.  They have lots of cool signature choices, and of course you can create one any way you like.  They have great fries, both reguar potato and sweet potato."}
{"text":"I'm not a religious man, but the bacon  cheese burger on steroids has me thanking the lord above. Six strips of perfectly cooked bacon - 3 jalapeño, and three applewood smoked strips of heaven.   And to top it all off, they have tater tots so the 5 year old in me can come out and smile."}
{"text":"This is a burger place halfway down the concourse.  If you eat here, you either:  A) Are starving B) Need to soak up the alcohol you're consuming at the bar C) Only have five minutes to grab a bite to eat (this isn't the place for you) D) Need to get takeout fast to take on the plane with you to stink the whole damn plane up (don't do that, it's rude and this isn't the place for you) E) Don't have enough time or wherewithal to walk half the concourse to the food court where there are better options  So if you find yourself in situation A, B or E; this is a perfectly average burger place with a bar.  Positive:  Eclectic topping choices.  I had a burger with brie cheese and Kalamata olives. Positive:  Local beer - try something new.  Negative:  The patty just wasn't very tasty.  If you're hungry, it will do."}
{"text":"Bad daddy's has always been a favorite of mine. Their bacon cheeseburger on steroids is to die for! I usually order pick up at the Ballantyne location, but I called this location on accident to order one time. A girl answered the phone and when I told her I wanted to place a to go order I was put on hold. When another server answered she barely gave me time to say my order and rushed me through the order, not friendly at all. At the end of the order she stated it was the East Blvd location and before I could respond (realizing I had the wrong location), she hung up. So I called back to be polite and cancel my order and the girl on the phone was very rude and snapped back at me \"that's why I told you it was the east Blvd location\". It took everything in me not to be rude back but instead I hung up. I have been serving for over two and a half years and I have never spoken to a customer that way. Very disappointing and rude.   Tips of service need to be brushed up on.  Poor customer service"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, helpful service. I would avoid ordering their margarita, but for a restaurant that's known for its beer and burgers, a bad margarita is certainly not a deal breaker. Definitely planning on eating here more often in the future."}
{"text":"Walked in 30 min before closing and 5 staff saw us with 3 staff looked over repeatedly but disinterested in seating us. Left and we are having a nice meal at Red Rocks. You are losing business!"}
{"text":"If we're talking about the food straight up, it was mostly inedible. Ordered the All American burger and fries to go and I thought I was eating a burger from cookout; except there was half a bottle of mustard on it that made me gag just trying to put it near my mouth! All I can taste is that mustard now. The fries were particularly disappointing, since they taste and smelled like they were fried in oil that had been there for a week. When I opened the container of food all I could smell was fish from those fries for some reason.  The bar seemed nice and I'm sure it's a nice experience to dine in and pair your burgers with a nice beer.  But there's definitely an inequality between price and quality here.  TLDR: food was kind of gross or ill prepared and overpriced for the quality of the food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this place was really good. I had a chicken sandwich, so I can't comment on the burgers, but the onion straws, sweet potato fries, service, and atmosphere were excellent. The accommodations were tight, but otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Im not too adventurous so I always get the same thing, the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. Which I love! The atmosphere is very nice. You can dine in or out on the little patio area. The staff is always nice and friendly. I'm big on customer service and they've always done a great job!"}
{"text":"The burgers were very good. The fries were a bit soggy. The highlight was the sauce. It's a bit like bbq with a kick."}
{"text":"I ate at the bar. And while ordering a salad at a place named Big Daddy's Burger Bar is probably crazy, the salad was very good. Got the grilled  chicken salad and it has lots of fresh veggies and the chicken had very good flavor. The bartender was very attentive with service and my tea refills. Both parties near me had some form of burger and they looked pretty amazing. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"An awesome upscale burger joint. Great for hanging, watching the game, and the family. And have other stuff beside burgers too.   The food we had was excellent. The Cue salad was fantastic. Great dressing for it. My daughter said the Classic Southern burger was an instant favorite. She knows her burgers. Not me, so you can bank that.   Service was unlike we've had in recent, or distant, memory. All were great to spend the evening with. At least they very much seemed they wanted to with us. It was very enjoyable.   Beer and wine were in good selection. A great place and we'll definitely be back...lots. One thing though. We were seated right by the door and it was pretty cold. But just got cozy and snuggled a little more."}
{"text":"I went there with my family for lunch. We ordered our food and after about 20-30 mins We got our food but they had wrong burger for me. Server apologized and asked if I wanted it remade. I told her it's ok, We were in hurry and I'll just eat the burger she brought. She told me she'll make my burger to go for free and should be ready before I finish my lunch. And ya, both of my burgers were delicious! Definitely going back there. Hope they bring correct order and faster. :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in Charlotte!  Great burgers, tots, onion rings, and shakes.  A couple of people have told me that they have delicious salads too.  But if I go to a burger place, I'm ordering a burger."}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if you could carry on a conversation. If they'd turn the music down a bit they wouldn't have a restaurant full of patrons yelling at each other to be heard."}
{"text":"Breakfast could not have been better anywhere in the airport! Fredrick waited on me this morning, but several staff members came by to check in, refill coffee, etc. everybody working this morning was friendly, efficient, and most importantly (in the setting of the airport...where Sometimes the niceties are skipped) everyone on the staff smiled and engaged in conversation.   The dining area was clean, music is appropriate for breakfast, and the overall atmosphere was comfortable.  I ordered a spicy scramble of some sort, at the suggestion of my server. The food was excellent, hot, and fast.   If you find yourself at the Charlotte NC airport, head to Terminal C for a decent meal and skip the hell that is waiting for you in the fast food area.   Bravo Bad Daddy's Bar...bravo."}
{"text":"That was some of the best service I've received in the airport. I've noticed that most waiters/waitresses tend to be short and not want to bother travelers, but my waitress was super friendly and asked about my flights and my day and I thought that was nice.   Onto the food. I ordered the magic mushroom burger, but got it with chicken instead of red meat. It was really good, especially with the sauce that's on it. I got it with sweet potato fries, which were okay. The two sauces that were served with them made up for the fries just being average. If I'm in the Charlotte airport again for a longer layover, I'd come back. Better than most of the options I passed that were mostly fast food or places that aren't necessarily substantial."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Daddy's Burger Bar 3x now.  The 1st time it was so loud & we were scrunched at the bar.  The burger menu I found to be too extensive to make a reasonable decision.  Had a regular cheeseburger.  It was a generous portion & definitely enough for not only me but one of my sisters to share.  Added a plain chocolate shake.  Watched it being made & it was standard vanilla ice cream, Hershey's chocolate syrup & milk.  It was thick but other then that nothing I couldn't make at home.  It was not as impressive as the wow factor others seem to tout as a reason to go.    Next visit I had the Black Bean Burger w/Tater Tots.  The Tater Tots had just the right amount of crisp & crunch.  Love that oil taste when you bite into them.   The Cantina 1511 Burger was a mess to eat.  Could taste & see the avocado dripping out w/each bite.  Where was the chipolte ranch?  Did not seem to be present on this burger.  The taste was all about the black bean patty & bun sticking to the top of my mouth that caused me to continually hydrate.  Next I tried the Buffalo Burger w/onion strings on top.  Again generous portion but where was the flavor?  Expected that the bbq sauce & onion strings that there were be big flavor.  Not to be found.  Big Daddy's is a friend fav so will continue to try & build a burger that has that bite that I'm searching for."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Food was very good and cooked to order and a decent selection of drinks. Plenty of TVs to watch whatever sporting events are going on. Try the buffalo tots they are awesome. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"My family was in Charlotte on a little spring vacation.  I looked at all the places we could go to eat and chose Bad Daddy's.  The food was good.  But it was greatly overshadowed by the poor service we received.  Josh was our server.  He was very inattentive and seemed to be working more at the bar than with his many tables.  Being a server myself, I like to give the person the benefit of the doubt, but the longer we were there the worse it got.    I'm am by no means saying that I won't go back for the food, because it was really good, but the service left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Another thing to mention is that the place was filthy.  The floors looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months and some of the tables sat dirty for a long time after the customer had left."}
{"text":"Food was great, service took a little long, but it may have been because our waitress was new. I recommend the daddy philly, great authentic philly cheese steak on a sub/hoagie."}
{"text":"Great burger, weird name. In an airport, of all places.  In this age of Giant Carry-ons For Everyone, the tables were too close together in this place. But the crowd was easygoing, probably because they were eating such tasty food.  I'll look forward to flying through Charlotte in the future. Nice job, folks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, super scrumptious burger selection that comes with a very rare side of Tatar Totes that also come with a damn good tasty house sauce."}
{"text":"This place has always been fantastic!! The burger selection is the best in town!  And the tater tots and sweet potato fries are hard to choose between ;-) They always have a good drink special going on and they have a large patio (good for all seasons). Only down fall is the wait time- it seems to always be busy so you WILL have to wait a bit ..... but boy is it worth it!!"}
{"text":"Best grilled black bean burger on build your own salad. My husband loves the Buffalo chicken sandwich. Yummy shakes."}
{"text":"Great and fresh burgers/ sandwiches. Their Cantina Blackbean Burger is the best I have had... It sounds strange but try it, it's that good. Fried pickles are awesome; staff, location, service, cleanliness are all great. Same goes for airport location. Outside patio is perfect retreat from the sun. Only reason is its a 4 stars is that it's a burger place."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to Bad Daddy's I've been impressed but tonight I was extra impressed. I always have such a huge internal struggle over what side to get, because I want them all. The sauces are great. I ordered a tuna burger tonight, ordered as rare as possible and I think that got translated to as cooked as possible. It was still really good, and I ate most of it, because, as stated it was good, just not what I expected. I asked the waitress if that was the rarest it could be, she said no and brought me a new one to bring home. Great food and customer service, I love this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone to the Concord Mills location twice. I was disappointed the first time but decided to give them a second chance because the Birkdale location is very good. His bacon was so burnt that it was extremely black and crispy the second go around. Bacon that burnt should not be allowed to be served on a burger! It was not edible. Both times were bad and we do not plan on returning to the Concord Mills location."}
{"text":"I have never been let down at Bad Daddy's Burger Bar at Birkdale. My boyfriend and I have gone several times and each time was delicious. The burger is cooked the way we request, the fries/sweet potato fries are never burnt and always yummy, and all of the condiments on the burger are delicious. The staff is very friendly and the seating is great (inside or out). We will be back here for another Pittsburgher and Bacon Burger on Steroids!  I would love for them to include cinnamon sugar for the sweet potato fries though so I don't have to bring mine from home"}
{"text":"Very yummy burgers, sweet potato fries and good selection of craft local beers. This place is my husband and I's favorite place for burgers."}
{"text":"We moved into the area last year and had yet to find a good burger place as we have been too busy checking out the tons of great food options. Found Bad Daddy's via Trip Advisors Top #10 restaurants in Charlotte list. Arrived and was told the wait time would be about 20-25 minutes, but our family of 4 only had to wait 5 minutes. Our server, Donnie, offered recommendations, was quick to make sure our drinks were filled, and overall did a great job keeping us happy :) We started with the fried pickles that arrived pipping hot and was plenty to share among the 4 of us. Our food was out fairly quickly which was again a surprise considering the place was packed with almost every table filled. I had the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with a side of Tater Tots. The burgers are cooked to order and does not disappoint. This alone would be enough to bring me back, but the tater tots were also delicious with a light seasoning on the outside and not greasy. My husband had Emilio's Chicken sandwich with fries for his side. He preferred the tater tots over the fries. Crispy hot chicken on a toasted bun with avocado, onion, mayo, tomato, cheese, pepper was the perfect balance of ingredients that made sure nothing overpowered the protein, but instead did its job of enhancing flavor. Kid's meal is a huge value including a drink, entree, side and dessert. Lastly, my husband and I decided to share the BD Snicker Shake. Our server was kind enough to bring our shake out in two separate cups after explaining that the shake is 20oz so he went ahead and just split it for us. Glad we only got one to share, because by that point we were just about stuffed! They have gluten-free and vegetarian menu options as well. Overall very happy with our Friday night choice for our family with children and look forward to coming back and trying the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Always reliable! Kids love it here! very good service!"}
{"text":"Very good burger, but the smell in this place is atrocious. You can tell that they are trying to cover up their cleanliness by putting more chemical down to mask the smell. Who wants to eat while inhaling the smell of chemicals? Not me. In addition, they even have the Fabreez plug in air fresheners, which tells me that they know they have a problem. Been a few times and live near it, but they are going to have to probably do a deep clean at some point...not to mention a 91 on their sanitation score...one more slip and they will be at a score that will eventually shut them down. Try Barcelona up in Mooresville if you are craving a burger...fresh, clean, and a comparable burger."}
{"text":"After two previous bad experiences I made the mistake at going back for a third time.  I sat at a table for 15 minutes and no one waited on me.  They are always under staffed, the customer service skills are severely lacking and when I simply asked a passing waiter if I could place an order I got the response \"I will try to find your waiter.\"  The next time she was walking towards me and our eyes met she actually stopped turned around and walked the other way.  This place is always crowded yet they have no idea to staff appropriately or teach customer service skills.  I travel through the airport twice a week, every week, and there will be no future visits to this place."}
{"text":"Cheese burger on steroids! A meal fit for 2.5 people. If you love burgers, you've got to try Big Daddy's Burger Bar!  Location: 4.5/5   Dilwoth FTW! Right on East Blvd. Knocking off 1/2 a star because finding parking can be a pain  Atmosphere / Ambiance: 4/5 Casual, family friendly atmosphere. Can get pretty busy though so be ready for a potential wait. I usually get take-out for this reason.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Well maintained facility.  Service: 5/5 Good service when I've dined there. My food is usually ready or there's not a lengthy wait when I order take-out.  Food: 5/5 Phenomenal burgers. Large amount of beefy goodness. If that's not your thing, the chicken sandwich is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I just had my first Western Burger at Bad Daddy's and it was amazing.  The toys were great too!"}
{"text":"The burgers were tasty but cold in the center and the sides were on the cool side as well. I ordered their Chunky Elvis Shake, but never received it. Looked good too - peanut butter, chocolate, banana and walnuts. Beverages came in late. Other than the chips and dip, that was complimentary, the service and food was mediocre. Last time I'll be going to this establishment."}
{"text":"Ventured over to Big Daddy's for a Sunday brunch.  I was a little leery of a burger bar having a brunch.  But I was quickly proven wrong.  They have breakfast from 9-11 and we got there at 10 with plenty of people in the dining room. I ordered banana pancakes and my brother got biscuits with gravy.  My pancakes were bananay, in a good way.  I could taste and see the banana's.  My brother also really enjoyed his biscuits.  It was a huge serving that included an egg on top.  He said it was a bit spicy, but delicious.  He almost finished his entire plate.  I loved it and the next time I'm back in Charlotee I'll have to come back and have a burger!"}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 1-December-2016 Time of my visit: Dinner, airport time  Well, I saw this place and thought it would be fun to have dinner their.  It's your typical airport setting, people running around, I found the name of the place to be hilarious!  I ordered Bacon Cheeseburger On Steroids with fries.  The food came out very quickly.  The fries were good, freshly made.  The burger was huge!  Honestly, this is by far the best airport food I have ever had.  The burger was juicy with just a right combo of cheese, bacon and toppings!  It did not fall apart while consumption.  I wish they had a location in Chicago.  On a side note, the waitress I got, was good too!  I was not expecting the service to be all that great at the airport joint, but she was really good!  Overall a must try! And an A+!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I haven't lived in Charlotte more than 2 weeks and have been here 3 times already. The thought of making my own salad with their great toppings and home made sauces and a perfectly cooked burger is fantastic."}
{"text":"The ONLY thing saving this joint from 1 star is their tater tots.  When this Ballantyne location first opened, it was our go-to burger place for juicy burgers, great apps/sides and spiked shakes.  Apparently complacency has kicked in and the last three times we have been there have been a train wreck of overcooked burgers and indifferent service.    I used to meet a friend here pretty regularly, as it was a halfway point between our homes, and we would meet early, typically on a Friday just after they open.  I don't know if the wait staff drags at 11:00 in the morning or what, but empty drinks when there are only 3 or 4 other tables sat is ridiculous.  But they had enough energy to stand around in a pack around the POS machine and chit chat (I would think having lunch with someone in a military uniform would cause service to step it up - but from a generation that thinks the world owes them a trophy for participation, I guess not).  Two of the last three times, my burger was dry and overcooked - what happened to the juicy burger that was cooked as ordered?  The last spiked shake was poorly blended and had a puddle of vodka at the bottom - how do you screw up a milkshake?  The tater tots were perfect though, super crunchy and hot.    With the new wave of burger joints opening all over Charlotte, there is no reason to suffer through mediocre (at best) service and overcooked burgers."}
{"text":"I do not usually eat pork or beef or related items.  Visited Bad Daddy's one fine day and tried Sam I Am burger,  Mannnnnn!!! words cannot describe the taste of that burger, so succulent and juicy, took one bite and dint stop.  Side or tater tots - are you kidding me.  It instantly became my guilty pleasure.  My wife tried a chicken sandwich during our first time and she loved it too.  Second time we were there i tried the Mama Ricotta's burger - well it was only better than Sam I Am.  The fresh mozzarella with the juicy burger and a thick cut of tomato slice just was a perfect combination of all things nice.  Sides of tater tots and cloeslaw - just to die for.  but this time my wife choose Sam I Am (of course my strong influence made her choose lol) .  Well am sure it was probably more than 1000 or 1500 calories but worth every calorie.  Great cocktail prices on a wednesday, that was an added bonus as well."}
{"text":"The Frenchie is my fav burger so far. I've ordered it with the sweet potato fries that come with a sweet, mustard-vinaigrette-ish sauce. The fried pickles are always good too. Milkshakes are bit on the uber sweet side and thick. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"I did lunch.  It is right next to Zapata's Mexican restaurant.  I have to say that the atmosphere was loud and manic.  Really busy and lots of hustle and bustle.  I sought sanctuary at the bar.  The wait staff and bar tender operate on high speed, so is hard to ask questions.  It is a burger and shakes place and that is the main thrust.  I got a burger, a Kobe burger, onion straws and iced tea.  The burger was nicely cooked and juicy, but, frankly, nothing special.  Thought the Kobe beef would be, but I don't think you gain any more flavor than a regular burger.  The onion straws were mostly onion bits/crumbles.  Not good and it was like getting the dregs from the container where they are dumped out of the fryer.  The guy next to me said, \"You should have gone with the fries.\"  I agree and pass that recommendation on to you.  The burgers are good and it is a popular place, so go on off times.  As I mentioned, the lunch crowd was manic. Will go back to give it another try as it has potential to be a fav place."}
{"text":"I decided to upgrade my burgers and went here. This place is the best I have been to. I love a good burger. You get a nice cold glass of beer and a great burger. I think this will be my new go to spot. I think you should try them out."}
{"text":"For an airport burger, this is pretty good. I got the bacon cheeseburger on steroids, and it was good. Cooked just right, big, juicy, tons of crispy bacon, and on a nice potato bun. They also served it quickly, which was a plus when in between connections. The tater tots are also great, especially with their smoky bacon mayo sauce. Just a heads up that this burger will hit your stomach like an anvil, lol, so I wouldn't plan on doing anything physical for a few hours. :)"}
{"text":"Finally got up on a Sunday early enough to make it for breakfast! I had a really hard time deciding on what to order. Everything sounded so good. In the end i had their version of eggs benedict  with queso and a side of jalapeno bacon. It was pretty awesome.The standout, as usual with me, was definitely the bacon. My friend got the breakfast burger and enjoyed it. I saw pancakes being carried by and wow those looked fantastic. Mental note made for next time. Id say the prices are fair for the meals as well. One thing though, our service wasn't that great. After being seated we waited about 10 min for a server, while the tables around us were being helped. They were not even busy. Actually now that i think about it inconsistent service has been an issue the past few times ive eaten there. Hopefully this turns around soon. I still think the food is still amazing."}
{"text":"First time trying this spot.  I had bun-less burger with sweet potato fries and enjoyed every bite.  Love the fact that you can create your own burgers and salads.  Great spot, only criticism is that it's a little small for how busy it is."}
{"text":"Great service. We had breakfast burgers & they were delicious. Burger was juicy & cooked perfect. The breakfast taters had too much onion & bell pepper for my taste but were fresh & hot. Can't wait to go back again.  Rio was my server & she did a terrific job!  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"We had friends in from out of town that just traveled 8 hours and everyone was hungry.  It was a Friday evening...We had a party of 7 with 3 children and honestly we could not of asked for a better meal or more exceptional service."}
{"text":"Bacon cheese dip was great, burgers were outstanding.  My 16 year old son said it was one of the best burgers he has ever eaten. And trust me, he is a burger connoisseur. The milkshake and banana pudding was a nice way to end the meal. Oh and the Bad Daddy Ale gets a thumbs up. And our waitress, Kristina, was a rock star. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Pittsburger tonight, it was great!  Also, you can create a salad with 7 different ingredients. Mine was really great also. This has the atmosphere of a local bar/restaurant with really good burgers."}
{"text":"Create your own salad was perfect...fresh veggies, warm grilled chicken and avocado ranch dressing on the side.  Hubby had the mushroom magic burger with home made chips which he totally enjoyed.  Fair selection of craft beers.  Excellent waiter:  Donnie Denis...just the right amount of attention and a great smile.  Sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather!"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's makes my list for Top 3 Best Burger in Charlotte. The burgers are always juicy and cooked to perfection. The topping choices are endless. Don't like what you see on the menu? Make your own.   My fave menu items...  Fried pickles - thin cut, lightly battered. ask for the chipotle ranch! Any burger - great topping choices. always perfectly cooked. Sweet potato fries - some of the best in the city. goes great with chipotle ranch. BYO Salad - burgers are great, but the real spotlight stealer are their salads! Chipotle ranch - just yum. ask for extra. you'll need it."}
{"text":"Allowed me to enjoy one of my favorite meals with my pup on the patio. Server was superb in skill and manner.  Food is always good. Good experience."}
{"text":"I went to Bad Daddy's many many years ago after I first moved to Charlotte when coworkers took me there.  It wasn't particularly memorable.  Tonight, ?however, I ordered two burgers with DoorDash (which is amazing by the way).  I ordered the Sam I Am for myself and the Bad Ass Burger for my son.  I was afraid the burgers would come dried out or not hot - but boy was I wrong.  The food was FANTASTIC.  Amazing presentation even in the ToGo box.  Big, JUICY... cooked exactly how I asked (medium) with super fresh toppings.  HUGE burger and juicy.  Did I say Juicy?  LOL.   VERY Impressed with my second time eating here and this time, they made an impression.  :)"}
{"text":"When you need a good burger in the Ballantyne area this is your place!  Ive had several of the burgers here, but just recently tried one of their chicken sandwiches... OH MY... I had Emilio's chicken sandwich, it was wonderful!  But then again, what isn't to love about a bacon crusted chicken breast with guacamole, jalapeno bacon, poblano pepper mayo, and mozzarella cheese?  It had the perfect balance of sweetness and heat.   The staff is extremely friendly, and the food is quite good.  They take pride in what they serve, and make sure that you enjoy the experience as much as possible. On our last visit there, one of our salads came incorrectly.  We brought it to the attention of our server who promptly apologized and then took it back to the kitchen to correct the situation.  As soon as the waitress seemed to disappear, the manager came out and made sure that the entire situation was being corrected properly.   **I must be 100% honest here... It seems as if every other time we go out to eat at various restaurants, there is a problem in one of our orders.  But Bad Daddy's definitely set the bar extremely high for how other managers need to handle those problems."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers places to go to in North Carolina, and also home to some great appetizers, desserts and salads. I enjoyed an amazing three-course meal at Bad Daddy's Ballantyne with great service. Our waitress suggested trying to BBQ Chicken Nachos (with grilled pineapple )that definitely lived up to my expectation and more. For my entree, I tried the Frenchie Sandwich with a turkey burger, grilled apples, Brie cheese, bacon and more with sweet potato fries. We got our meals very quickly and you could tell everything was hot and fresh. For dessert, we treated ourselves to the Peanut Butter Pie and oh...my...goodness. The pie crush tasted like a PB/Chocolate cookie and the filling was a mousse texture with chocolate drizzle on top. Typically, PB brittle is served on top but we decided to not get that. On the other end of the spectrum, their salads are also a great option with the Greek being my favorite. Overall, a great experience! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday evening and was surprised to see a decent wait. I had been hearing about this place for a while and some say its the best burger in Charlotte. I don't eat meat so I was able to indulge in the bean burger which was heavenly. I had mine grilled while my husband had his fried but we both enjoyed them. I had mine topped with slaw, jalapeños, grilled onions and some of their mayo.. it was amazing! A bit of a mess to eat but I didn't mind at all. I had the fries as my side and also had some of my mother in laws potato chips and I think I liked the fries better, so good! We were able to sit outside on the back patio and it was wonderful, not too hot and it was covered which was great. I took a to go menu as well because this might be my new place to get a bean burger in the area."}
{"text":"Overpriced and Overvalued.  First time here. Hubby ordered the 'Big Daddy' with tater tots for $13 and I ordered off the gluten free menu:  a buffalo burger with lettuce instead of a bun and a side of fruit for $11.50 (and was charged $12).  Very disappointing. The \"Big Daddy\" was just a mess.  It was hard to eat and just didn't have much flavor.  You would expect for $13 that it would at least have a unique taste.  My buffalo burger was a sad little paddy on top top of about 4 leaves of iceburg lettuce stuck together.  The burger itself tasted great but I could have ordered a salad for less than that and gotten so much more \"food\". The side of fruit was just disgusting. It was clearly frozen fruit that was thawed and was watery with no-flavor. I didn't even eat it. There is no excuse for frozen fruit in July when you are surrounded by farmers.    As for drinks, we both ordered a Spiked Arnold Palmer for $8 each and even as a light weight who drinks maybe once a month, there wasn't enough alcohol in it to give me a buzz.   Our final bill was well over $50 for 2 burgers and 2 drinks.  Just not worth it.  I would go to 5 Guys any day over this place and pay a quarter the price and have 10 times better quality of food.  Very disappointing. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"OMG! This place deserves an extra star just for being absolutely delicious! When they talk about Finger Licking good they are referring to Bad Daddy's Burgers!!!  I lived in Charlotte for a bit and this was a frequent stop for me. I came here at least once a week. The very first time I had a burger with an egg on it was here at Bad Daddy's. The burgers here are easily going to be one of the best burgers you'll ever have. I know that's how it is for me.   Not craving a burger? No problem- you can build your own sandwich. I built my own chicken sandwich which was succulent and juicy. You can see from the pic I posted in this review that the bacon just looks crispy and delicious.   The service here is on point. The wait staff are extremely attentive and granted you will not be disappointed at all.   It's a perfect location, just the only thing that's a hit is the parking, but I usually park across the street next to Caribou.    If you are craving one of the best burgers you'll ever put in your mouth you MUST check out Bad Daddy's!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a four hour layover in Charlotte and wanted a GOOD burger! So glad we came in! The Magic mushroom and the American was just what we were looking for. Michael at the bar was very pleasant and makes a mean Tito's and soda( two limes) for the lady and they have a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and go there frequently. I usually sit at the bar because I love Liz! She is always so friendly, attentive and gives great recommendations. The food is even better! You can pick seven different toppings for a side salad!!"}
{"text":"Very loud atmosphere. Burgers are like anywhere else.  Appetizers are good.  Customer service was bad. Ran out of drinks and burger wasn't cooked correctly sent back  3 times. The only plus was very large item list to pick from for burger toppings and items where fresh.  The best pimento cheese in the world.  The only reason I would go back would be for pimento cheese. Cost too much for what you get"}
{"text":"Burgers are great.  Fresh and tasty.  Would recommend the tater tots over the fries.  Staff is friendly and service is good.  They have great build your own salads as well !"}
{"text":"The food is very good. The service is sufficient. They have a nice selection and try to accommodate any requests. They have a bar for those wishing a alcoholic beverage. I ordered a beer that was served very cold. My burger came quickly and cooked the way I like it. The fries were some of  the best. The only problem with the place it's not a place to relax and have a leisurely meal. They don't rush you but it's a bit hectic. Went back for lunch today. Not really changing my review but adding some info. Don't get the Chili. It's more like a bland sloppy joe with beans. Shouldn't be called chili. Oh yeah, I'm not one for real spicy so if it was bland for me fagetaboutit.  I ordered theSouthern Burger and left off a few things, saved $2 then \"build your own\" option on the menu"}
{"text":"Need some extra pork on that burger?  Craving something out of the ordinary that your can eat with you hands?  Want to get fancy, creative, or even messy?  Bad Daddy's can meet all these requirements and more!  I've been here at least once a month for the last year and I've never been disappointed.  Bad Daddy's has a great staff, and an amazing menu.  You can get really creative with your burgers here.  And don't forget to check out what you can do with salads, too!  Almost anything you want is here.  They also do some very interesting things for their specials, so always be sure to ask about those.   We've had a fontina burger, a pulled pork burger (a hamburger with delicious pulled bbq pork on top), and a few others with interesting additions such as pimento cheese and jalepeno bacon.  Bad Daddy's is also popular for their milkshakes.  They have several interesting and yummy flavors (chunky elvis!) and can also make them more \"spirited\" if that's what you're looking for.  This is a locally owned business, and the owner has several popular restaurants in town.  You just cannot go wrong here, everything they do is done with care and attention.  Don't forget to try the tots.  They're just about perfect and come with a kickin' sauce!"}
{"text":"Well I got pretty much what I expected and then some! So many burger options left my lunch partner in a dazed state about what to get exactly! The burgers are huge and tasty, there's plenty of sides to choose from also so it can get a bit intimidating. Sweet potato fries came out hot with some awesome honey mustard, yum! The parking lot is a bit small, and my medium well burger came out a bit more red than I wanted but I didn't bother telling the waitress since I was short on time. Looking forward to more burgers here!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the past couple months, and I'm always impressed! Service and food is excellent.  Of course the burgers are excellent! They have a great selection of toppings and sauces to go with them as well. My son loves the burger and tater tots, and he is picky! All the sides I've had there are awesome, but I'm definitely partial to the sweet potato fries.  The salads there are wonderful as well. I've ordered the create your own salad with grilled chicken a couple times. They are fresh and tasty, with perfectly seasoned and cooked chicken.   I Love this place! Great for all kinds of tastes, not just burgers."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch before our flight out for the holiday. Big mistake. We were seated close to 1:30, which gave us over an hour before our flight was scheduled to begin boarding. Waitress arrives at our table 10 minutes later. We order 2 sodas and a lemonade for the mini. 5 minutes later the drinks are brought to the table and we both order burgers and a hot dog for Junior. Waitress says it shouldn't take very long. She leaves, I try my soda, it smells and tastes funny. Now, working in the industry myself, I know what the smell is. It's the flavor of tea that is dispensed through a bag-in-box system like sodas are. Disgusting. When our waitress reappears 10 minutes later, I explain the problem, she offers to bring us bottled sodas and says our food will be ready shortly. She returns with bottled sodas 5 minutes later. By now it's 2pm and I'm starting to worry about being able to eat before our flight. Waitress says our food will be right out. 10 minutes later she says the same thing. 10 minutes later we ask another waitress to have our food packed up to go since out waitress has disappeared again. 5 minutes later, part of our order comes to the table, and we are told that my burger will be just a minute. Wife's burger is already cold when brought to the table. 5 minutes later my burger arrives, the side of tater tots is ice cold. 5 minutes later our waitress finally arrives with our check, at which time I informed her of the shoddy quality of the food. She got a manager to comp the check, which was nice because by the time we boarded our flight the food was 100% inedible. Oh, and while we were rushing out of the restaurant to make our flight, I observed the expo scratching his beard with an ungloved hand right before pulling a plate out of the window.   I think this place needs a name change, Yeah they have a bar, and the owner is probably someone's father, but it would be far more accurate to drop those words and just call the joint Bad Burger."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night. Parked on the street right in front. Told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait. As were standing there it's servers constantly moving, and what appeared to be the manger, he's not standing still either. We were seated sooner than the promised time. Service was good. Had the \"Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids\" it was huge and very good. Their desert menu has about 3 items. But after their burger, you honestly should not have space for anything else.  I read a review that said they were expensive. I would say if you are accustomed to eating Whoppers, McDoubles, Jr Bacon Cheeseburgers, and Big Macs that range from $1.50-4.99.... Then to you it will be expensive. But for the quality and size they put on your plate, I would say that they are priced fare."}
{"text":"Awful.  Took over 30 minutes after ordering.   Coke was all soda, no syrup.  $14 Burger ordered well done, came out raw.   The \"Coke\" was $3.50.  I regrettably paid cash prior to it coming out as I was rushed.   When I returned the burger and asked for refund, rushing to catch plane at this point, server kept the $3 tip. Never again.  Stay away."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places!  Love the black bean burger.  Had breakfast for the first there today and it was amazing too."}
{"text":"I was ready for my usual airport food as I travel in and out of airports weekly, I had a little more time and opted for something other than my normal slice of pizza. This place was packed, couldn't get a seat at the bar but the hostess got me seated really quick. Service is on point and quick as well without feeling rushed but If you have a flight to catch they will get you in and out.   I started with the enchilada soup, this is the best complaint I can ever give... It was so flipping hot I had to wait for a bit to eat it, and that alone made me smile.. I was starving and did wish a was a bit cooler but holy cow, no one will ever whine about cold soup here.   I opted for the mama (rosa)? burger. Fresh mozzarella and olive oil with a pepper and tomato. It was cooked to perfection.. One one gripe is it did sit in the windo for a minute so the juice made the bun soggy. I'll ask for a grilled bun next time. I do eat my burgers MR so there was definitely blood in the bun... The favors were awesome and again, server on point making sure everything was great.   So final result, Charlotte airport found a winner!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I are big fans of their frenchie turkey burger as well as their sweet potato fries. The burger is not at all dry, which it seems is hard to come by in a turkey burger. We have never eaten inside, always take home so I can't speak to that. Their outside patio looks nice though!"}
{"text":"the make your own salad makes this place totally worth a visit.  we love it here. the mama ricotta burger is phenomenal, and the cantina burger is awesome!  i always opt for turkey burgers, and while they are a bit more greasy than i usually like, i don't mind when i'm here!   the decor inside is nothing special, but eating a burger outside in the spring/summer here is perfect!"}
{"text":"Smelly bar with poor service ... seems as though our food ticket was \"'misplaced\" to go along with the lovely service"}
{"text":"Not much to say but service which was not that great, have bottomed out  Took the day off to follow the eclipse and I had a window where I needed to drive to get to my photo spot.  No problem because I had a wide window.  First choice did not open till 11:30 am but not big. Wife loves the Frenchy  turkey burger while I like the the Western Buffalo Burger.  That said, we were seated quickly but did not see a server till 10 minutes later.  After the order, it was as it we did not exist. No one checked in, no one cheeked on drink refills so we went more that 30 minutes with no interaction till out order showed up  Wife did like her Frenchy and my Western Buffalo Burger was good but nothing outstanding.  Food quality is OK but not great much less outstanding. Service is somewhat south of average.  On the high end for cost while at the same time, nothing to justify the higher cost.  An  outlier in this chain or restaurants because others offer better service so don't hold this one against the whole.  This one I can not endorse  They have been better but don't know what has appended."}
{"text":"WOW, was I ever impressed. This had to be the BEST BURGER I have ever ate. Everything was great, the fresh cut fries, the mayo-sauce, CREATE YOUR OWN MILKSHAKES, Etc. Noticed they have Create Your Own Burgers and Salads, along with their regular menu items. They also have a full wine, beer, and bar menu. They even have Craft beer on tap. The service was awesome, too. They boast having a chef driven menu. I can't wait to return on my next trip down South. This restaurant is a MUST GO TO!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest burger fan, which may be why I am hesitant to give five stars. That being said, their unique burger combinations are SO good and the burgers are always juicy. They have a great beer selection, and good Bloody Mary and mimosa specials on Saturdays and Sundays. Service has always been good. I wish there were more options than burgers and salads though, as you are slightly limited if you're not in the mood for a burger. But if that's the case you should probably not go to a burger joint! Have yet to try their breakfast, but am really looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Opened 10 mins late, and extremely slow service. If you are in an airport, and have a take out counter, one would expect decent speed to get food."}
{"text":"ok, well I have actually tried this place.  The service was a disaster, but I'll give them a break because I assume they are just getting into the swing of things.  My beer came with my meal at least half an hour after ordering, and my salad was not what I had ordered.  They didn't offer to remake it, but later when I asked him to remake it, it was done rather quickly.  Overall though I was intrigued by the place, and will def. go back to try the burgers, but I think I'll wait a couple weeks so they can work out the kinks.  The salad I had was cheap, but beware they can be quite salty.  I think burgers are def. the way to go here (duh).  The onion strings had good flavor but had to be eaten with a fork because they were so small and crushed.  UPDATE-  I got a takeout burger so that I could try their food without having to deal with the bad service-  Can you believe that the service almost ruined my takeout experience??  They told me the food would be ready in 6 minutes.  I show up 15 minutes later and the food is not ready.  I waited a few more minutes and asked about the food and was basically told to piss off.  30 mins later I had a burger and thirst for blood.  No one apologized.  What assholes (did I mention I recognized a few of them as degenerates from high school?).  Oh, and this was 3:30 on a Monday when there were only a handful of customers (and the burger wasn't anything special)."}
{"text":"Used to love this location but recently it has gone down hill. Just stopped in for lunch and we were seated fairly quickly and we got our drinks from the person who sat us, the coke was completely flat. Then we waited and waited but never saw a server in our section. I noticed a server that we liked had an open table so I went to the front to ask to move since we did not seem to have a server. The woman open mouth yawned at me and said she would send him over. She replaced the coke with a lemonade and left. A few minutes later she came back and asked if the new server had come over yet. He had not. She then went over to him and was shaking her head and pointing at us and seemed aggravated so we just decided to leave. I am pretty sure the woman was a Manger but either way it is going to be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"Visit date 11/28/2017-  This was my first visit at this location. I have been to the other two location in South End and Huntersville  FOOD- I had the Maui Tuna Burger. It was ok, I have had it cooked better from another Bad Daddy's before. My sweet potato fries was not fresh (they were warm and too much salt). My husband had the Bad Ass Burger. He said also is was OK just too much fried onions. So for our side we ordered fries and tots. My younger son had a cup and a half more then we did, I showed the waitress and they bought us out more.   INSIDE- They have a lot of T.V's on the wall, they all are very clear. Great place to watch the games. NOW IT WAS VERY COLD INSIDE,  I WAS SO READY TO GO!! Had it not been my son birthday, I would have been left!!! My husband had to go and get a blank from the car! I was talking the other ppl eating and they ALL said the same thing, one couple left. It had to been around 68 degrees inside, yes It was cold OUTSIDE, BUT OUTSIDE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INSIDE.  PARKING: Parking was good you should not have a hard time finding parking.   SERVICES- Services was always good."}
{"text":"This place was jam-packed when my boyfriend and I went a few weeks ago, to be expected in an airport. Whenever traveling, we make it a point to try the local beer offerings. Here, we ordered a couple of local beers by NoDa and were not impressed - not sure if it was the beer, the can, or if they were skunked (which is, of course, quite possible)... but no, not crazy about them... just a heads up for other out of townies. We got the fried pickles to start and they were delicious, as was the ranch dressing. I ordered the Pastrami Reuben burger and oh Mylanta it was great, just what I needed after a long day of traveling. For a side, I got the potato chips which were far too overcooked and inedible as a result. Otherwise, a great meal with good service."}
{"text":"Tater tots!!! You've have to order these when you visit. Even though it's known for its burgers, I really like the chopped salads. I've never had the milkshakes but my daughter thinks their delicious."}
{"text":"I LOOOOVVVVVVEEEEE THIS PLACE!!! it seems so crazy to me that you can go to a place and CHOOSE to eat a salad!!!! the build your own salad is GREAT!!! in order for me to get a burger i have to been in the mood but thats only because its too heavy for me but all the burgers i have had there have been awsome as well. highly recommended....  if i had one complaint it would be the parking but hey....................."}
{"text":"I like this place, but I think that I always think that I like it more than I do.  Its usually consistent and that's key in a restaurant.  But the thing that gets me is that no matter what, my bun always comes out soggy, as in no matter what I order the bun is very damp by the time I start eating it.  And my other big peeve is that why do you continue to ask my how I want my burger cooked if it is always going to come out pretty much well done and nowhere near the medium rare I ordered.  But the service is always good, and the tots are always good.  I do like these new (to me) parmesan truffle fries I had recently, because I am a big fan of very thin french fries, but they could have been a bit crispier.  Prices are pretty reasonable and they always seem to have drink specials and a sandwich of the day, so that's cool."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum.  I've been here a number of times and it is consistently one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  The regular burger with cheddar, mushrooms, onion rings and a side of chipotle mayo - wonderful!  The tater tots are great as well.  The service has drastically improved since our earlier visits.  On our last visit, our server Chaseon(?) was wonderful and even turned the TV to the football game we were interested in.  Good prices too."}
{"text":"This location is too small. Hard to move around when all the tables are seated. Food is just ehh."}
{"text":"The bartender today was such a sweetheart and so fun and attentive. She made sure we were taken care of before she had to go do other things for her bar and was a blast to talk to when she had time. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"I ate at Bad Daddy's tonight celebrating a major milestone in the life of a high school kid I mentor called Omar; he had never been. Omar pounded down a big milkshake before we even had supper and we all shared some fried pickles. Bad Daddy's fried pickles are tasty but they aren't my favorite in Charlotte. They slice them long ways which makes them a bit more difficult to eat since aren't \"bite-size.\" Slicing them into chips is a better method in my opinion.  Omar had the nachos because he gets nachos everywhere, even at a burger joint. I shared the Texican Chicken Salad with Juji. It was delicious and felt less naughty than a burger. But their burgers are amazing, I've had way too many of them. I'm partial to the black bean burger, but don't be fooled into thinking that's a healthier option than beef. Great burger choices are the Cantina (black bean), the Frenchie (turkey burger), and the Carolina (beef). Some girls got lettuce wrapped burgers and loved them, and one guy got the Big Ass Burger. That one is ridiculous. Fried Bacon?? It was like 8\" tall.   Bad Daddy's has a good selection of beers local, domestic and import. I had an OMB Copper because it's hard for me to choose anything else when that one is staring at me.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch as well as for meeting up with friends after work.  So far this is my favorite burger joint in Charlotte. There is a good selection of different burgers on the menu, including buffalo, chicken and vegetarian options. My two favorites are the buffalo burger as well as the \"Sam I am\" burger. For those looking for a slightly healthier option there's a large selection of ingredients for creating your perfect salad.  The service tends to be friendly, although it can be rather slow during peak hours.  While the food is always good, lately there have been problems with burgers getting overcooked.  Overall the food is great. Assuming the problems with cooking the burgers correctly get resolved, then I would not hesitate to rate Bad Daddy's a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Burgers were great!! We was very disappointed that they shut the shake machine down early."}
{"text":"Rating: C | Overall Score: 76/100 | Thoughts?: Burger n fries were on point! Service missed the mark... | Got: Mushroom burger and sweet potato fries | Score Breakdown: 8/10 Selection: Yep, there's choices  9/10 Price: $$ Standard for a burger n fries 10/10 Speed: Host told me 15 minutes, right on target 8/10 Portion: Decent amount of fries and normal burger size 10/10 Freshness: Burger was proper good and the fries were soooo yummy 11/10: Amosphere: Bonus for bumping Zeppelin 9/10 Cleanliness: Sure 0/10 Recommendation: After asking for a burger and a side, asked 8 questions so I just ordered something and they yelled VOID; unacceptable service  5/10 Service: Host was super helpful, but the takeout window was impatient and rude 6/10 Going Back? I'd consider it"}
{"text":"My new favorite burger joint. We visited 30 min before close. Instead of rushing us, we were greeted by a smile and awesome service. The gentleman behind the bar saw that or son was getting antsy waiting on food, so he offered us some soft serve vanilla ice cream. It was good, but not as good as their burger or chicken sandwich. Absolutely enjoyed our to go order when we made it home. The portions were big and the prices are very reasonable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Read another yelpers review that this is their go to food place when traveling. I can see why. The price was right, food was decent and service was very good.  I would absoulutely recommend this place when traveing through Charlottle"}
{"text":"Love the burgers here! So many burger and beer options. Also, vegetarian alternatives are just as delicious."}
{"text":"I've had some really great burgers here, and some just OK burgers. The service is super fast. I always get the tater tot instead of french fries. For some reason they just can't do rare or medium rare, every burger comes out very well done. Once you get your meal, you should check right away to make sure that all the food is exactly how you asked for it to be. Otherwise you might not see your server again until you flag them down for the check."}
{"text":"Always a great spot to get your burger fix! If you can eat like a Champion try the Bacon Burger on Steroids or the Bad Ass Burger!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Bean Burger from the takeout window which itself ended up being really good. The service could use some improvement though. During the ordering process the host seemed to be very distracted and I don't think she fully heard the customization I wanted for my order. I noticed she wasn't fully paying attention so I double checked and she got an attitude and said yea I got it. It still ended up being wrong but after ordering and waiting 20 minutes for my food I had just enough time to rush over to my flight and didn't notice until it was too late. I travel through Charlotte weekly and I am most likely going to re-try this restaurant as it has vegetarian options, I just hope next time the service is better and it doesn't take so long."}
{"text":"First visit today and the service was awesome. I had the fried pickles and the western burger,would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I went to Bad Daddy's for the first time and noticed that they are not ADA compliant for their outside patio. Their main entrance has steps as well and the side door that is the only \"convenient\" way to get in is kept locked and the stones are uneven making it bumpy/unsteady. Management needs to update their codes to ADA."}
{"text":"Every time I come through this airport. I have to stop for a decent bite. There good and quick to get you on your flight. The food is always fresh and the service is always friendly and quick.     It's on my way to my connection so it's perfect.  I never had a bad meal so it's my go to place when I travel."}
{"text":"This place comes close to being my other MUST-eat for my Charlotte visitors. Definitely if someone says they want a good burger. While they do have some interesting options on the menu, it is simple to create your own burger to get exactly what you want (can choose the meat, bun, toppings). They have all of your options laid out in front of you with prices listed.  My favorite is just a burger with jalapenos, jalapeno bacon, ketchup, lettuce on Texas toast (dipped in the Big Daddy Sauce).  Everyone at my table usually has a different side item and they have all been good: tater tots, fries, sweet potato fries, and onion straws.  My girlfriend loves the Cantina 1511 black bean burger (it's ironic since we really didn't like our visit to Cantina 1511).  We had nearly an hour wait around lunch time. To counter the poor service previously mentioned in another review, the hostess was friendly and thanked us for waiting and the server did fine. With all the various toppings and alterations to burgers that we've made, they have always gotten the orders right.   My only complaint would be that some of the tables can put you in pretty tight quarters sitting back to back with other customers.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip with a few hour lay over and decided to try something instead of the usual chain resaturants.   The burgers were a step up from a chain restaurant but I have had better.    The side dishes were good and did offer a nice sample.   Luckily I had a few hour layover and not in a rush as the service is SLOW!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The beer amd fries are good, but the burger itself was a bit messy. The chicken was tinyband the lettuce fell apart as the sandwich was assembled.  The waitstaff is quick and attentive, and kept in mind that we had a flight to catch while on a layover.  Not the greatest but worth checking out if you have an hour or two to kill."}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed when I visited this joint. The food was so so and very greasy. You should definitely hit up crafty burg'r instead!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is great! What's better than a burger and beer!! I had a delicious bacon cheeseburger with a local beer from 26 Acres Brewery! Perfect! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The burgers are big, but delicious! The Ricotta burger was the bomb! You must try it. I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and take people to in Charlotte. If you want giant portions, decadent menu options, and leaving the restaurant feeling like you need to unzip your pants...Bad Daddy's is your place. Parking is a little hectic, but that's because it's always busy. I went to the original location in Charlotte on New Year's Day with a giant hangover and a need for grease. We got an order of the Truffle Parmesan fries to split for an appetizer, which were out of this world! I love Truffle Oil, and Bad Daddy's does not sprinkle it on these bad boys.  The waiter was extremely knowledgeable and joked around with us. He offered up some awesome selections, which I'm working on trying each time I visit. I tried the  Pittsburgher*. The menu description goes as followed \"Topped with housemade American cheese, spicy garlic ketchup, leaf lettuce, tomato, onion and topped with shoestring fries\". A side of tater tots came with it, and I was sold. The burger was on the bland side, but with all the fixings it didn't ruin my experience. My friend got the \"Sam I Am\" Burger, which has pesto and a friend egg on it. I'll be honest, I have to get that next time...it was out of this world! The staff is great, the menu is awesome, and you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after Carowinds since we thought they would have something for us vegetarians.. we were so glad we did , the black bean burger on a lettuce wrap was delicious.. I always try to order lettuce wrap but every other restaurant just serves my burger as a salad and it's just not the same. Bad daddy's had it on about 8 leafs of lettuce which was perfect and it actually felt like I was eating a burger. We will defitnetly be coming back"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here!  We came here to kill some time in Charlotte while waiting to fly home and I'm so glad we did.  I quite possibly had the best burger I've ever eaten at this place. It's called the Frenchie and it's a turkey burger with brie, bacon, apples and garlic mayo. Oh my, it was amazing! And the sweet potato fries were perfectly seasoned and plentiful enough to share.    The hubby got chicken wings and liked them.  He also ate the 2nd half of my burger (it was really big) and my boys got kids meals and enjoyed them, too.  They even got ice cream with their meal.  The menu is really great, lots of creative options. Will definitely be back here when in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"After checking out the food court and passing on the normal trash good offerings we found this place, a sit down restaurant, that had promise.  The service was fast and friendly and we didn't feel overly ripped off by  the airport prices.  The setting was cute, seating comfortable.      Music was fantastic for someone my age, assuming I was drinking a half dozen beers and wanted to really enjoy myself for the night.   However, between encapsulation in flying canisters we were looking for quiet, relaxing. I have to feel that \"Iron Butterfly\" type music, the softest being  CCNY played loud, were played, not for enjoyment but to get my heart pumping do I'd eat fast and clear the table for the next flyer.        Food was somewhat limited, obviously mostly burgers.  We would have liked a late breakfast.  We both had grilled chicken on whole wheat rolls with fries. Meat portion small, roll portion quite large and mealy. We both took the meat out and ate it with a knife and fork. Fried were fine, not great.  All in all, service quick, friendly, prices fair, food just adequate.          We will be passing through the airport next week and will lunch at Sabarro next for.  Always good.  You always know what you're getting."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is a perfect spot for a Saturday burger and iced tea (or brew) before hitting the shops or park with the family. The burgers are GOOD, creative and fast. I've never had to wait long for a table, and the outdoor seating area is the best place to sit on a nice weather day. The atmosphere is relaxed, not at all stuffy, and the servers and hostesses are extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a rainy Sunday and were seated on their enclosed, heated, and surprisingly cozy patio. Hubby was happy because he was facing the TV and was able to catch the football game.  The food was awesome! Giant, tasty burger. Super yummy, deep fried pickles. Excellent sweet potato fries. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Excellent food and great customer service. Try the burger with the egg on it. So yummy."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING! Never again.    Okay, food isn't terrible but the portions are insanely small for the cost. Comparably, Killingtons in Huntersville gives you a veggie burger that could almost feed three people for almost the same price.    Veggie burger wasn't anything special. My girlfriend added bacon to hers but it was cold.   Service was poor. Decent atmosphere and sitting outdoors is nice. That's about all it has going for it."}
{"text":"Horrible experience tonight....  The burger was more raw than medium well... The salad came out after we ate our meal....  Waitress never offered us anything.... Very disappointed..... We usually get better service and food.  I am not sure we will be returning anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Loved it. Went with a small group this weekend, and first off the service was fantastic. Friendly hostess and extra friendly server. Great beer selection. Our friends ordered the fried pickes, and they were SO GOOD. Wow. I'm not even a big pickle fan, and I'm craving it. I ordered the Bad Ass burger-medium. Three words: deep. fried. bacon. Yowza. All the toppings were great. My burger was just a tad over cooked, but still delicious. My husband got the BBQ burger (not sure the official name), and while his was well done instead of medium...he said it was great. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tried a new burger place what a good burger!! Go for tater tots fries where just okay service was very nice and helpful get the Sam I Am burger"}
{"text":"This was a nice place to eat, fun atmosphere, the waitresses seemed a bit rushed less sociable. I should not of gotten it but I was hungry just off a 5 hour flight from California but i got the Ruben burger  with tater tots... it was pretty damn good, if you get there sauce on the burger even better!! I only finished half and saved the rest for later tonight but over all I dug this place"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints in the area. The Western Burger is amazing, and it might top the other burgers I've had at Bad Daddy's. My goal is to try every burger in this place, give me a few more visits. My wife had the Tuna burger, she said it was one of the best Tuna burgers she has ever had."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bad Daddy (formerly Big Daddy's). I lived in Charlotte for 5 years and this place was my top 3 restaurants. The burgers are great! I only have had the turkey and bean burger burgers. However, every person I have brought here has loved it. The airport site is a good compromise if you can't go to the original location. This was the highlight of my travel. I love the black bean burger with sweet potato fries with the chipotle ranch. It's delicious. It's definitely busy at all times. If you have a short layover, you should order take-out. The milkshakes, fried pickles and tater tots are also tasty."}
{"text":"This burger bar, a place I usually want to come visit when I visit Charlotte, offers up a pretty tasty burger, though not the best I've ever had. The reason I like it so much isn't because the actual burgers are that amazing, but because of the huge variety of stuff you can get on top of said burgers. It's amazing, and most turn out more deliciously than you can imagine. My favorite is the Frenchie, which is brie, apples, bacon, and garlic aioli on a turkey burger - which I almost always switch out for beef. There aren't many places you can get brie and apples on a burger, and I'm pretty obsessed with it. There are a billion other choices like that, or you can construct your own weird burger (the last time we went, a friend got grilled pineapple, queso, and bacon on a turkey burger... and she loved it).   The sides are also tasty, but not really the main draw for me. Everyone seems to like the sweet potato fries here, which I actually think are really bland without the sauce, and I like a good sweet potato fry that stands up without sauce. These don't. The regular fries are good, similar to Five Guys, as are the tater tots, which are pretty standard, but nice and crispy, which I appreciate. Ask for some sauces (chipotle ranch? yes.) to improve your potato-based experience.  OK, now for a few cons -- it's always so crowded, and loud inside. Expect to wait in the parking lot for a parking space, and inside for a table unless you're incredibly lucky or come at like 11 am on a Tuesday. Because it's always so busy, the wait staff can be hit and miss too. Most of my experiences have been pretty good, once you actually sit down.  With regards to the actual meat, I feel they could improve in this area. They obviously don't grind their own sirloin, which is pretty surprising AND disappointing for a so-called burger bar. Because of this, you can't get a burger cooked less than medium. No favorite burger of mine is ever going to be more than medium-rare, so this is very sad for me. I do have to say that the beef burger was remarkably juicy for being cooked medium and not being fresh-ground.   In conclusion, if you're a burger purist seeking out the best burger on the planet, this place isn't going to have it. But if you're a burger adventurist and want to put all kinds of weird stuff on your burger, then you'll love it here. Worth a try for anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch prior to a movie.  It was a nasty rainy spring day - I think i'm a curse.  Every time I go to Birkdale it rains.  But I digress.  Had the french toast and it was awesome.  It appeared to be batter friend.  My heart still hurts.  I ordered a side of the corned beef hash and it was NASTY.  The corned beef and potatoes were shredded and stringy.  It was like a pile of corned beef noodles. It was just weird weird weird.  I was a little peeved.  They messed up several orders at the table.  Mine being one of them - They neglected to put in my hash order with the rest of the meal.  So my French toast came first.  I saw how large that order was an since I didn't have the hash yet I tried to cancel the order.  The waitress refused.  It was strange.  If you haven't fired it yet (b/c you forgot to put it in) why not let me cancel it.  At the end of the day I spent an extra 5 bucks for an inedible side."}
{"text":"WOW! Do I live this place. Great and friendly service, awesome music and fantastic burgers. I ate my food in .5 seconds and was ordering more. Also the drinks are phenomenal! I had the caramel apple martini made with fireball whiskey and could not stop drinking them! The glass is coated with caramel syrup and I did not have to order dessert. I highly recommend this place and will be coming back whenever I am able. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers often, but when I do I go to Bad Daddy's. I like my burgers simple....a little cheese and a little bacon is enough for me but they have jalapeño bacon which really kicks things up a notch. Combined with great drinks and awesome servers makes it a great cheat meal experience for a fit chick like myself!"}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers! Thirsty Thursday will be a day to go. 3.50 for local NC drafts pair with an order of fried pickles ( it's a large batch) I was not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a flight connection for a burger to go and a drink. I was in a big rush. Jason immediately greeted me at the bar and got my drink started. He put in my burger order and it was ready within 10 minutes. The to go was packaged well and had everything I could need. The burger was delicious. Jason was great. I gave it 4 stars only because my single shot drink was $10. But great service and food!"}
{"text":"Did you know Bad Daddy's has breakfast? The most important meal of the day and a great start to a day of travel. A little slow, but worth the wait especially if you have the fantastic service of Darijo! I've always loved Bad Daddy's burgers and tots, but now I have a reason to go there at sunrise."}
{"text":"I liked this place the first time I went, but lost my hype following the second visit. I do believe they have good food, and some stuff I've tried is very good, but just not always consistent. My boyfriend got the Big Ass Burger and it completely fell apart, the cheese was not melted, it was cold and pink in the middle. (He asked for well done) I love burgers and this just isn't consistent enough for my liking!   I wouldn't say don't try it, because some stuff if yummy! I wouldn't not come back, but it may take a while before I do."}
{"text":"After driving by several times and doing a quick search on Yelp, I decided to finally try this place. I had a craving for a good burger so the timing was right. Unfortunately, my whole experience was bad from the beginning. When we first walked in, one of the servers walked right in front of us so we said hello. He did not reply and completely ignored us. While we ate, I noticed that he was walking around with a blank stare looking at employees and serving tables like he was a loss prevention officer at Best buy instead of a waiter. Why in the world would someone with this personality be hired by a restaurant? I was expecting higher prices since this is a specialty burger place but the quality of the food does not hold up to their expensive menu. The parmesan truffle fries were OK but had just faint hint of truffle in them. The onion straws were not crunchy at all and were full of grease at the bottom of the plate. The NIck's Patty melt that I ordered was soggy and the caramelized onions on top were more like boiled onions, without a hint of brown. Come on, a patty melt is pretty hard to mess up. In general, the whole staff seems to lack any basic customer service skills. They were very inattentive, seemed bothered when interacting with us, and would disappear to go talk among themselves. I got the impression that the staff feels that I should be flattered to have the opportunity to eat at such a \"hip and happening place.\" A smile goes an long way people! If you are going to charge high prices, the service and the food must be impeccable."}
{"text":"Always have to come here to eat when visiting family. This place is super delicious and I enjoy that I can customize my burger or salad to my taste. They have really good burger creations of their own as well!   I definitely would get the shakes, so so so good and paired well with a nice greasy burger. Definitely a place to go to if you're in the mood for all american burgers and deliciousness. I wouldn't reccomend it too much if you're on any sort of diet. :P"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I don't get a burger unless I have someone to share it with, but the burgers I've had are really tasty. My favorite at lunch is a side of tater tots and the build your own salad. It's my favorite salad in town - they have so many toppings to choose from! It's just so so good!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a cool crisp salad and found it here at Bad Daddy's. The create your own salad allowed me to pick all my favorites and create a delicious summer fruit salad. Would highly recommend for my health conscious eaters."}
{"text":"Love this place - great burgers - best of any airport I have been to.  When in Charlotte Airport, which I am in a bunch becasue I fly US Air, this is my go to spot.  You will notice this restaurant in the wing becasue it is almost always busy.  Expect to wait or cozy up really close to someone at the bar.  The interior is whimsiaclly decorated with old comic books, posters and ample TV's.  For those on the run, they have a quick service counter to the left of the opening.  Music is not overpowering.  The menu is all burger bar with very few salads.  For those that don't eat cow there are other options like turkey burgers and chicken burgers.  Their are a number of composed burgers with ingredients based on theme.  For those that like to build there burger there are a plethora of options from white cheddar to applewood bacon to fried eggs.   I have never had a bad meal here even if I was eating a turkey burger.  You can even eat paleo here becasue of all the options.  I will say the only dissapointment are the fries.  That not withstanding, it is always a safe and quite tqasty bet in the airport.  Until by next flying gastronomic escapade, dine fine."}
{"text":"Always good burgers, and I guess they better be if that is mainly all they serve!! Parking can be a bit of a pain, we parked in the lot across the street for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and were in and out in about 45 mins (good service) and came out to find our truck had been broken into.  So try and park in the lot closer to the building.  besides that the food and service are really good, seating is limited during rushes especially on the weekend so you may have a wait.  I have seen tons of families with small kids in here so it appears to be pretty kid friendly (I don't have any, but just a heads up)."}
{"text":"I came here to meet up with a childhood friend, and well this will be a short one. There wasn't anything that I could say overly positive about Bad Daddy's. They just gave me a burger, and that was about it. The burger was just alright. I ordered the Bad Ass Burger, and after doing some research on here with fellow reviews, I knew they did lettuce wraps. Thus, obviously that's what I ordered. I rather have it nice and fresh with the lettuce and it helps with the diet.  The burger... was sort of disappointing. In that the way it was wrapped it wasn't let's say dominated by the lettuce wrap with a lot of lettuce, rather just some skimpy amount which made the burger unable to hold. On top of that, one bite and the burger sort of just fell apart. The jalapeno bacon was pretty good, which I think was their touch. For the side, I ordered the tater tots... I know. It's a weakness of mine. But hey, I got the lettuce wrap! It wasn't bad, it wasn't crispy, but it wasn't soggy so that was good.   Bad Daddy's alright. I guess if you live close by and you want a burger, I guess this could be a place to check out. For lettuce wrap fans, you'll probably be a little disappointed. That's probably it. Service was pretty good, there's no complaints there. I had fonder memories of Bad Daddy's, but I guess those thoughts have changed since the last time I had their food."}
{"text":"This is my go-to burger joint in Charlotte. Their burgers are all very different and very delicious. Their meats are always cooked perfectly and their sauces are very very good. I've been to the Ballantye and Dilworth locations and I must say that both have really good service and the food is very consistent. And vegetarians have no fear, they have non-meat options. The cantina (black bean) burger here is amazing and you can sub it for any meat option or byob. Solid beer selection and there are plenty of tv's to watch the game."}
{"text":"I took my son here last night before the Charlotte Hornets game.  When we arrived we were seated right away by a polite host, however we sat there for 20 minutes and never even got drinks or had anyone offer to serve us. The food here may be great and my son really wanted to try their burgers but the service is very bad.  Two tables seated after us got orders taken before us as well, and we had been there at least 15 minutes before."}
{"text":"Quality  burger on a potato bun. This burger is not massive, but the texture  of the meat is great. They don't put at lot of seasoning on the burger cause the don't have too. Simple and delicious."}
{"text":"YEAH BABY!!! What a fun little burger joint!! I went on a Monday at 7pm and it was packed. And I found out why!  The burger was awesome; the best part was I had the choice of tots on the side instead of fries and they rocked! My table ordered all different types of burgers and not one person was dissappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger place and the service is good too. Every burger can be made with alternatives of beef, turkey, or veggie but who the heck wants a veggie burger? The fries are very good and the house sauce is great. The beer selection is diverse and there are rotating selections on top of the permanent list.   Definitely a good spot for a burger and a beer!"}
{"text":"If you want a burger this is the place to go.  The parking at bork dale really sucks.  Go during off hours"}
{"text":"If you like burgers and tots this is the joint. Well done Some burgers are so big - well had to cut it in half"}
{"text":"For large parties on Friday nights plan on spending lots of time waiting for a table. However once you get in and seated, service is very attentive is the food is well worth the wait. I had the PittsBurger with Turkey Burger with the House Chips and my friend ordered the Western Bison Burger with tater tots. Both burgers were excellent, cooked to perfection and the tots and chips were outstanding. If your in the area and in the mood for a juicy delicious burger, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great Burger place the topping are a the regular with some special twists. Onion rings on point . Went during lunch rush and was able to enjoy and get out in a good amount of time. Great service ."}
{"text":"This place is great every time we go! On our last visit, my husband and I split the buffalo chicken sandwich and the Cantina burger and we were both stuffed and satisfied by the time we were done. I've had both the onion strings and the sweet potato fries and they were better than at most places but my new favorite thing is their house made bacon mayo or Big Daddy's sauce. YUM."}
{"text":"Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids.  Holy amazingness.  I was visiting my family in Charlotte and we decided to take the drive over here for dinner one night.  Boy am I glad we did.  After drooling over the menu, I decided on the bacon cheeseburger on steroids minus the house made bacon mayo (mayonnaise freaks me out for some reason).    The only way I can describe my first bite is bacon heaven.  Jalepeno bacon, applewood smoked bacon, and bacon salt on the burger all combined into the perfect bite of burger.  The burger with fries came to $12 which is a steal in my opinion.    My only complaint (which isn't even a serious complaint and I'm not taking off a star for it) is that when I left, I felt like I was covered in grease, but it could be all the bacon grease seeping out of my pores.  It's not going to stop me from going back, though!!"}
{"text":"My third time visiting Bad Daddy's was this past Sunday June 1st. Every time I have been overly impressed with the staff as well as the food. We always choose to sit outside on the patio. It is covered, heated, and equipped with ceiling fans, perfect for any weather conditions! This place is always busy no matter what time of day we stop by, but the wait is never unbearable. And they utilize the No Wait app which texts you when your table is ready. You can even \"get in line' on your way to the restaurant.  I prefer to build my own burger and even tried it with the fried egg on top. While it sounds a little out there, it was AHH-MAZING! Totally recommend the banana pudding! I would have given it 5 stars, but I'm not a fan of the french fries. They always seem to be a bit on the soggy, underdone side. I would opt for the tater tots next time around."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger in Charlotte.  I never realized before moving to the South that most places around here cook your burger almost well done whether your like it or not.  I appreciate that Big Daddy's asks me and I always say medium which means it comes out juicy and delicious.  I can't comment on all the things on the menu cause I always get the same thing, burger cooked medium with white cheddar, avocado, and mayo.  It's heavenly.  The burger is just juicy enough and the toppings are great.  Tater Tots are a must but the sweet potato fries are good too.  My husband has ordered the Bacon extravaganza burger (that's not the real name) and said it was almost too much bacon, so maybe steer clear and get something else if you don't LOVE LOVE LOVE bacon.  There's a great beer selection and the patio is a nice place to sit on a sunny day.  Sometimes it gets a bit crowded but the food is good so I'll wait!"}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints around. Burgers are a bit pricey but you get some amazing choices that I can't find anywhere else. I am always so super full when I leave the restaurant. I have never had bad service or had to send any of our food back. Bad Daddy's is one of my top spots in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Our new favorite burger joint.  Had the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with tater tots and could not finish it.  Burgers cooked medium rare are hard to find but they can do it here.  The house sauce, a combo of chipotle, mayo and bbq sauce is very good.  Service was fast and friendly and the food came out fairly fast as we went in the middle of Saturday lunch rush.  They also have a fair beer selection.  We did not try one but the spiked milk shakes looked interesting."}
{"text":"The burgers taste great, the prices are fair, and the service is pretty good. The only reason I did not rate this place higher is their burger selection. While the burgers themselves taste great, the selection is not unique at all. There is nothing that really keeps you coming back as opposed to just going to another burger boutique. Add a pimento burger, a pork burger, or anything with unusual toppings. Otherwise, what's the point of going here instead of the competition?  Parking is also a bit iffy as the parking lot is too small, but there is plenty of street parking."}
{"text":"I love Bad Daddy's.  We go at least once a week to either Huntersville, Mooresville and Concord Mills.  Those locations are always terrific and 100% consistent.   The airport location is awful.  Painfully slow service and sub par Bad Daddy burgs.  As I write this, it took 15 minutes to order, 20 minutes to get my food and another 15 minutest to get the bill paid.  Oh, no drink refill, no how was your meal.   People this is not a reflection of the chain, just a reflection of awful management."}
{"text":"Food was good but server seemed a little uninterested in serving us. Oh and the AC was blowing extremely hard and it we were freezing the entire meal. I think all the other customers were cold too but I guess they were able to deal. Overall it was cool for my first experience."}
{"text":"Can't front. This was a great burger. I almost missed my plane getting it but it was well worth it. It was juicy. Fresh toppings just made the burger even better. I wish I would have taken a picture but I was so damn hungry when I ate it it completely slipped my mind. The only thing this place is missing his phone chargers. You can go in and have a seat if you have a Hostess or you can get something to go"}
{"text":"I went back because it didn't stink when I walked by. The burger and beer were excellent if the staff was a bit slow to clean the tables. But a much better experience."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food, but their kitchen is crazy slow. Allow at least 20mins for the simplest order. Both people in front of me had waited the 15 mins they were told, then were told it would be another 15 mins and had to cancel their order add they were out of time."}
{"text":"Had lunch today, first time here. While their burgers are fairly big and juicy, so are their prices. Lots of options for sides and add-ons, but at added cost. You will not leave hungry. For me there are better options for a good burger."}
{"text":"Fried mozzarella burger is soooo good!!!!! And I love the fries and the sauce they give you with them! So so yummy"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, I really do. In theory, it just *gets* me. Innovative burgers. Tater Tots. Creative (and boozy!) shakes. It really should be a match made in heaven. But, alas, life just ain't that simple. I've tried about 4-5 of the burgers, and all of them left me feeling underwhelmed. Today, I got the Bad Ass Burger. The \"buttermilk fried bacon\" sounded otherworldly in theory. In practice, it was heavily-breaded bacon (?!) that just made the burger hard to handle/eat. Bruh, how you mess up BACON?!?! Felt the same way when I got the bacon burger on steroids before.   Sure, the tots (and sauce) are worth the hype, but that ain't the main attraction. The shakes were good, if a little inconsistent in terms of varying thickness / drinkability. And the times I've tried to booze up my shake have also been hit-and-miss.  The service has always been super-friendly and attentive, which almost makes me want to bump the rating up a star in and of itself. But I just can't. Feels slightly unfair to judge Bad Daddy's based on what I want it to be, rather than what it is - a decent burger + shake spot. But all's fair in love + burgers, and I'm just not that into you."}
{"text":"Horrible food. I ordered the turkey burger what i thought would be juicy and round. What i got was a dried burger, non season, made with old meat!!. I complained and exchanged it for their chicken burger, bad idea!! The chicken burger was 80% bread and 20% chicken, no flavor. After all that the manager recommend the beef burgers because they are the best thing on the menu. Really you tell me this now. My waitress tried her best and was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had a layover, was craving a cheeseburger, so I thought this would be the perfect place!  I put in my name, waited 5-10 minutes. The hostesses were giggling and did not seem to care much about customer service. They did not make much eye contact or smile, and seemed to have a bit of an attitude.  When I was sat down, took another 5-10 minutes for my server to take my order. I ordered the frenchie (turkey burger). It took another 15-20 minutes to come out. The food was pretty good, but the wait time was way too long (especially for an airport). My server did not come check on me, so I had to get up and grab some silverware myself. My check took another 5-10 minutes after I requested it while eating.  While eating, I noticed probably 80% of the servers did not look happy at all. Not a typical \"stressed-cause-it's-busy\" look, but really a \"I-hate-this-place\" look. Does not make a pleasant atmosphere when everyone has attitude.  The tables were also crammed very close to each other. The atmosphere overall was really, even for an airport. Very loud in there.  I would not return. It is 2 stars and not 1 because I usually just give 1 star if the food is inedible...and the actual food was pretty good, although messy."}
{"text":"This place has been SO helpful to me when we travel! I don't like paying to eat at airports, but sometimes it is necessary. This is one of the only restaurants I can eat at in any airport I've been to with all of my food restrictions. I am extremely thankful that they use canola oil for frying (not soybean, corn, or peanut). They offer burgers wrapped in lettuce, and their homemade ketchup is corn-free (rare!). They also have a convenient to-go window. It is a relief to travel through Charlotte, because I know I can go without starving. Thank you, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre especially for the price. Much better bar food to be had in the area. Additionally we waited for over an hour as people much lower on the list then is were seated before us. When I asked the hostess what why that was she got an attitude and was rude and condescending. If you want a pleasant staff, and good food for the money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have a soft, medium-rare spot for burger-themed restaurants and this place does not disappoint. They play fast and loose with the term \"burger\" here, with a bacon-encrusted chicken sandwich, portabella melt & pork burger all falling under the moniker of the usually ground beef based sammy. Prices usually between $8-11; includes a side (indulge your inner Napoleon Dynamite & do the tots).  Build your own burger or go with the Frenchie (Turkey burger, brie, apple, bacon), Sam I Am (pesto, ham, fried egg) or any other over-the-top sounding selection on the menu. Jalapeno bacon? Bacon mayo? Yes please x2!!! The milkshakes are terrific, but a little on the pricey side, IMO. Pretty good tap beer selection. Fun atmosphere. Usually pretty crowded, even with outdoor seating. Ocassional celebrity sightings (I've seen Fred Couples & Jay Bilas here on separate occasions). A really fun place, with some of the most unhealthy burgers you could ask for. Bring your burger-enthusiast amigos and bask in self-satisfaction as they rave about how awesome this little place is."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! I had the Pittsburgher and it was just the right amount of burger! the stirngy fries and sauce on the burger was amazing..will defineltey be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Tasty Burgers and huge milkshakes!  I hit this spot on my return trips all of the time.  The service can be a bit slow at times and the quarters are cramped, but what do you expect in a dang airport?  It is my goal to run the gamut on the burger section.  I have yet to be disappointed.  It is hard for me to resist getting a milkshake with my burger.  My belt is getting tighter so it won't be as difficult to skip the shake next time.  (Try the Oreo Milkshake!)  They do have a take away window but I have not patronized it yet.  I may try it the next time I have a short layover.    All in all, I like this place and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Yum, omg yum. This was super good bar food. The burgers were so huge and you could tell they were hand patted out. The onion straws were amazing. The tots aren't greasy, so forego fries for tots. Extra props to poke server whom spilled my drink and had sense enough to stop it from spilling into my expensive handbag"}
{"text":"Oooh yeah, bad daddy. Wait a second, this isn't the start of Alex L's erotica writings. Lucky you.  Apparently this is a newish chain of restaurants throughout NC, SC and Denver. I was lucky enough to run into it during a transfer at the Charlotte Douglas Airport. I needed an excuse to eat like a bad daddy (this is killing me) and lucky for me...it was Cheeseburger Day. I needed to seduce my wife, who is a pescetarian to indulge in a burger with me. Even the strictest pescetarian (auto correct wants to make this proletariat which would also be an accurate statement) can't resist bad daddy's allure of a juicy burger and she proved to be no exception. \"OK, just don't tell the whole Internet.\"  So we sat down, were handed a menu and both of us ironically fixated upon the vegetarian option which looked most appealing. It was a black bean burger with avocado, onions and some jalapenos. I asked our server about it and he suggested subbing the black bean veggie patty with a juicy meaty burger. My kind of guy! So I did and asked for it to be cooked medium. He warned me that it would still be pink in the middle which was purrrrfect.  My wife stuck with the vegetarian option, but made me promise to let her take a bite of mine. No problemo. I loved the fact that the burger came with a choice of fries, tater tots or coleslaw. I went with the tots. The burgers came out within 5-10 minutes, which is impressive since it was a pretty full bar / restaurant, but I guess they gotta keep it speedy at the airport.  I loved it. The bread was high quality, fluffy and the burger was cooked perfectly medium, which many restaurants seem to fail at. It was served with a side of sauce, tomatoes, onions, cheese and lettuce with avocado and onions on the base of it. The flavors came together wonderfully and the meat was seasoned very well. My wife and I exchanged bites and I loved her vegetarian patty and she seemed to enjoy the sinful delicious bite of my burger, breaking her normally pescetarian diet. \"You're not going to tell the whole Internet, right honey?\" \"This will be our little secret.\" We exchanged a sultry look while continuing to chow down. The tater tots were fantasimal as well -- crispy, crunchy and delicious. Her coleslaw tasted fresh and healthy.  Entertainment was plentiful as a burner sat down a few tables away from us and attempted to engage in conversation with the beautiful single girl who was sitting  at a table next to us. He was trying to impress said girl with his burning man adventures and we listened with glee placing bets on whether or not he would try to get her # at the end of the conversation (he gave her a business card instead).  Final verdict: delicious burgers at an airport. Prices are very reasonable for the airport ~10-12 a burger (you can substitute Kobe beef for an extra $5 if you want). I suggest getting the black bean burger but subbing the black bean patty with a juicy meaty patty."}
{"text":"Simply put- I am a fan!  Great atmosphere and the menu was very enticing, it was hard to pick.  But alas, I went with the frenchie, and it was pure heaven, I might go order take out now (yes they have take out!).  The fried pickles were a great start and the tater tots were perfectly crisp.   I am a huge fan of burgers, coming from Atlanta with the king of all burger places (Flip Burger Boutique), Big Daddy's just might be my go to place for a good burger.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic great fries great tarts great salads little surprise of this only has a 3 1/2 star rating other than the weight sometimes which is to be expected because it's such a popular place the food here is really good. I will agree that the prices are a little bit high for a burger but great food I personally like the burger with the pimento cheese on top outstanding"}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to say about this place. It's just not that good to me. The burgers are WAY overpriced and the meat is flavorless. They may have some snazzy choices for toppings but that doesn't cover up the fact that I cannot taste the meat itself. The beer selection is good. Not a highly memorable experience for me. I have been there twice  BTW so it wasn't a one time bad experience, at least they are consistent."}
{"text":"Good place for an expensive as hell burger.  They sho am delicious though!  Don't be surprised if you wait a long time for your food.  You will be full."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm......burgers.....  I was back in my new-old-new hometown this week for some business meetings. I am really impressed with how Charlotte has developed over the past five years. It is no Atlanta or Boston but it has its own unique charm. One of my favorite hoods is Dilworth.   One of my co-workers said he was craving a burger so of course I yelped it. Parking was a bit of a chore but we found a spot near by. Big Daddy's BB was still busy around 9:00PM so we opted to sit outside. It was nice but a bit chilly so it would have been nice to have the heaters blowing.   We ordered a round of beers and looked over the menu. The menu could have been organized better. It was a hard to read in low light and the appetizers selection was kinda lame. We went with nacho apps that were on special which was a suggestion of our server. They were some pretty lame nachos. Upgrading the apps should be a priority since most of them looked lame. But hey, you don't come to a burger bar for finger food. On to the main course, I went for the chicken club burger. It was a little sloppy but was delicious. I really enjoyed my tater tots but the big daddy's sauce was bland and didn't stand out for me.   Big Daddy's is a great place to grab a burger and beer and just people watch in Dilworth."}
{"text":"So great! Fried pickles came with a lot and were so fresh. They were really good. And with ranch, yum! My burger was excellent. Had the All American with avocado and a side of cole slaw. Everything was perfect. New favorite place for burgers in Charlotte. Hope they do not disappoint if I ever come again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are adventurous and like different types of burgers. Their selection of burgers are unique and appetizing. You can even build your own burger. I went during the afternoon rush crowd and was amazingly seated right away. I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and the bad ass burger with tator tots. The burger was humongous and there was enough tots there to share the meal with another person. I wasn't able to eat all of my food so the waitress boxed it up for me. I let the waitress know it was my first time eating there and she made sure everything was ok and answered any questions I had. She also kept my lemonade filled.

{"text":"Amazing food!  We live in Atlanta where Bocado burgers rule, but Bad Daddy DESTROYS Bocado.  It's worth driving 4 hours for one of these burgers.  Lots of burger places pile on the goodies, and BD does that for sure, then scrimp on the beef.  Not so at BD!  Beef is served in quantity, the way you want it, and richly flavored.  On top of all the great food, the service is superb.  When our Visa gift card did not work, the manager explained why, and we worked it out.  Will be back for sure, even if it takes 4 hours to get there."}
{"text":"Too bad 0 stars isn't an option. There are plenty of other options at CLT. Spend your money elsewhere. I walked up to the hostess who couldn't answer the simplest question (Does your restaurant have beer flights?). Then I was directed to the bar, where there was a single 2-top available. Sat my stuff down and caught the bar-tenders eye and started to ask about flights; he told me he was busy, and I needed to wait for my waitress. Mind you the table was beside the bar. The waitress approaches...  and just wow... the waitress was a complete ass. I was looking forward to trying out a burger and a few beers, and leaving a generous tip, but left because the waitress was that bad. I make it a point to only leave good reviews (check my reviews) but this one was so bad that I never even ordered. My butt never even made it into a seat. If the service is that bad, rarely is the food worth it."}
{"text":"The burgers are a little pricey, but they are worth it!  If you are able to finish your entire meal (and believe me, you'll want to) you'll kind of hate yourself...because it is a ton of food.  Let me paint you a picture...I'm not even 5\"2, weigh about 115 and I NEVER leave a single bite of burger on my plate...EVER.  It's too good!  The Sam I am Burger is something that you MUST have at least once in your life.  I like to build my own burger and I'm a huge fan of adding their jalapeno bacon mmmm...mouth watering.  Not to mention, this seems to be the only burger place in Charlotte that can get my fix of medium rare... Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the prices are right! Last time I was there, I ordered the PBJ milkshake. It sounds a little weird, but it was DELICIOUS. The only downside is the small size of the location; there's definitely going to be a wait if you go Friday or Saturday night. Definitely worth the wait, though!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Fun and friendly bar/pub atmosphere. Kid friendly and great food.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was awesome and huge. The second time I ordered the bacon cheeseburger on steroids and it was so big I couldn't even take a whole bite.  The size of the burgers and the quality of taste is something to keep us coming back for more. :)"}
{"text":"So fair warning, this place is over priced even for an airport. I got a burger (came with sweet potato) fries and a boozy milkshake and my bill was $34. The waitress took a bit longer than normal, but I had a long layover so it wasn't a huge deal. Once she took my order, The burger came out in a reasonable amount of time, however it was over cooked as I had requested medium rare and it came out medium well. I asked her if she could take the party to have it cooked properly. She very politely obliged and actually brought me out an entirely new meal. This time the party came out medium and I was happy to accept it that way, because I think the issue is that the party is not super thick and was probably frozen before hand, so health safety wise, the cook may not have been able to achieve medium rare properly. Over all the burger tastes fine, it was seasoned properly and big enough that with the fries, I only ate half and took the rest to go. The sweet potato fries were fine too; not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means. The cookies and cream milkshake was not good. The liquid to ice cream to cookie ratio was way off. It had a very thin consistency and was not blended very well. There were huge chunks of cookie clumped together in the bottom and there definitely was not enough ice cream in the blending process. Overall, this place is pretty on par with other airport food. It wasn't fantastic, but I've had worse and my server was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Bad Daddys's. I have been coming here since they opened and I am a fan. I was afraid that after them being traded under the GTIM (NYSE) they would change the quality, thankfully, that didn't happen.  Still one of my favorite places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My waiter was really nice. He was very accommodating and really made me feel welcome. The other wait staff looked pretty similar at least though they all looked a bit rushed.  The food... Was I guess decent enough. Definitely no where near decent enough for the price but really basic Family Diner type vibe. Which is really the problem. It was simple and Bland but well enough cooked. My omelette was straightforward, and the bread even was pretty much as generic as you can make something. Like I said, it would be pretty good at five or six dollars.  Also... Coffee is $3. Which just seems ridiculous when it the most generic of generic coffee."}
{"text":"Tots.  Build your own Burger.  Badass burger.  I love Bad Daddy's burgers.   This is a great place to grab lunch and have a really good loaded burger.  They're always made exactly how I like it.  Perfectly cooked.  And they serve tots!  The tots are crispy and delicious, and it's a large serving so I always take some home with me.    There are just a few things that Bad Daddy's is not a great place for... it's always loud in here.  No matter how many people are here, the voices just bounce off the walls, making any dining experience a bit hectic.  And if you go during meal times, there is almost always a wait.   I'll be back though, time and time again for the Build your own (with avocado, bacon and pimento cheese!)  and the tots that are out of this world.  Nom Nom nom."}
{"text":"Disappointed that the mushroom burger had onions in it - menu did not state this Had to send it back Menu should reflect what you will actually get"}
{"text":"The burgers are good small for the price the fries were soggy they would have been excellent if they were crispy.service was excellent.would not go back because it was not a good value for my dollar"}
{"text":"Service was quick. We stopped in when we had less than an hour for a layover and told them that so they brought food quickly. My friend's burger looked good and he said it was tasty. I was less excited about my salad. I got the chicken salad and asked for dressing on the side. It was brought out with the dressing on it and I didn't say anything since we were in a rush. I asked our waitress what the best salad was and she recommended the Texican Chicken Salad. If this is their best salad, then I surely don't want to try the others. The chicken in this salad was pretty bad- it was overcooked, flavorless and tasted like it had been sitting out for quite a while. Portions were decent and prices were typical bar prices ($8-$11 for burger or salad)."}
{"text":"Good Place for a Quick Brew near Gate. The service was fast and very friendly.  Next to my gate.  Good beer selection.  Nice ambiance and very clean."}
{"text":"Be sure to pack your patience if you want to stop in for lunch on the weekends. It gets PACKED. I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon during peak lunch time (1:30 p.m.) and it was jam packed. The parking lot was and is a tiny lot that requires a spatial logistics degree to fully understand how to get in and get out without dinging anyone's car.  This is all to say how thankful I was that I was picking up my order to instead of sitting down. I had placed my order for the 'cue the chicken salad. Yes, I chose a salad from a burger place. The wait for pick-up was not long and I was pleasantly surprised at the very generous portion size. Although I guess I shouldn't be all that surprised since it did run me $11. The salad was very filling and packed with flavor. I really liked how the chicken was pulled, shredded chicken instead of the very non-realistic chicken cubes that can be found in salads at most restaurants.    I was also surprised at the friendly, courteous service at the take-out counter. Normally, wait staff can rush you and in out or just flat-out ignore you when picking up. Glad to say that was not the case on a busy Saturday."}
{"text":"1. The staff is always friendly and competent.  2. The portions are HUGE - which is good or bad depending on your perspective.  3. The food is always good.  Now, there are a few things that removed a star. Sometimes the toppings aren't quite correct - for example, the awesome Magic Mushroom burger had very few actual mushrooms on it. But what it did have, and the sauce, was amazing. And the quality of liquor is questionable. The Bloody Mary looked great, but the first sip and I could taste a bitterness in the vodka. There was also way more ice than necessary, which isn't desirable in a $7 drink. And they carry Mark West Pinot Noir, which in my opinion is a over-priced wine that tastes of oak. I'm sure beer lovers will be better pleased with their offerings.  A couple of other suggestions:  Go with a different catsup. French's is WAY too sweet. Hunts or Heinz has a better balance (and Hunts has no additives).  Balance out the slaw. There's something odd in the taste. It's like it tastes a tad off. I suspect less mayo-base and maybe a bit more acidic would help. That, or go with a Greek dressing that does NOT include Greek yogurt.  It's not cheap, so I feel justified in having a few opinions. But overall, it's a very pleasant place, and you won't leave hungry (you'll leave with leftovers). We've visited and gotten take out several times, so it's definitely a place I'll continue to patronize. It just still has a little room for improvement."}
{"text":"Maybe since I'm not a huge fan of burgers or just ordered the wrong thing, but I don't think I had the best burger ever as everyone else seems to claim. The burgers on the menu were a bit too much/big for me for lunch, so I am glad that \"build your own burger\" was a thing. One of us substituted the buns for a lettuce wrap, and the whole thing just immediately fell apart.   The Bad Daddy's sauce was pretty good though."}
{"text":"I'd say Bad Daddy's has some of the most interesting sounding burger combinations ive seen in town. They are big and tasty and come with tots instead of fries if you want, which I recommend. Can get pretty busy so getting on the list with the NoWait app is recommended. Seemed to be a kid friendly place as many families were there. Look forward to trying another burger soon."}
{"text":"I would usually feel guilty about eating a big ol' honkin' burger for lunch, but I tend to cut myself a little slack on Fridays.  Therefore, last Friday I went just down the street to Bad Daddy's to enjoy a big ol' honkin' burger.  The decor is fairly typical for a popular burger joint: lots of posters, servers dressed in black shirts and jeans, and so on.  They were already busy at 11:45, so if you're on your lunch break, I wouldn't show up at noon.  However, I was seated with minimal fuss and proceeded to order a Southern Classic burger, with chili and slaw, accompanied by sweet potato fries.  The burger turned out to be quite tasty, if not quite as tasty as a certain fairly-close restaurant's.  There was just the right amount of pink, and the slaw and chili were both freshly made and good.  The sweet potato fries were nice as well.  I initially thought that thousand-island was a strange dip selection, but it turned out to work well.  My only complaint was that Bad Daddy's definitely follows the narrow and stacked-high burger model.  This might look cooler than a wider, flatter burger, but it makes the thing very messy to eat.  I brought a textbook to lunch, but it went untouched, as I feared to slop on its pages.  My conclusion: go early, don't bring a book, but try Bad Daddy's."}
{"text":"Walked in was immediately seated. Waiter came over his name is Frederick, asked would like something to drink. With in one minute ask me what I like to complete my order. Went over the options with me and then repeated it back exactly as I had said it! Great meal $9.99 without Great Christmas music perfect start to the day!!"}
{"text":"Look. here's the brief and skinny.  Do you like Burgers? They're all good. Do you like Tater-Tots? They're great here. Do you like traditional fries or sweet-potato fries instead? Great. They're good too. Do you like fried pickles? Awesome. Order some. They're great too. Want lots of good burger options? Pick one.  Want your burger any way you want it? Choose to build your own. Want your salad any way you want it? Again. Build your own. Want a big slab of burger on your salad? Yes, that's an option.  Want turkey burger or veggie burger instead of beef on any burger? No problem.   Seriously. Burgers, salad, fried things, with more options than should be legal. And on top of that - milkshakes and a full bar."}
{"text":"On my way home from business trip, during a layover in Charlotte stopped here.  Obviously when you are eating in an airport, you take what you can get I suppose. Nevertheless I was pleasantly surprised by this odd little Burger joint, most especially by its drinks, alcoholic frozen beverages, in my case cookies and cream. My burger was OK my peers had a crazy bacon laced, baconaise topped monster they enjoyed,but the drinks were the highlight of the experience."}
{"text":"I love Bad Daddy's burgers. I almost always build my own burger with a fried egg and Bad Daddy's does it perfectly, the yolk runs all over the burger. mmm. On this particular visit I decided to try something new and got the fried mozzarella burger. As you can probably imagine from the name, it's a burger topped with a slice of fried mozzarella. It was so big I could barely open my mouth wide enough to take a bite. It was really just ok. The mozzarella didn't taste very fresh and was kinda chewy, and I had ordered the burger cooked medium, but it was well done. I hate to complain and almost didn't but I was just so disappointed- a lot of what makes this my favorite burger joint is that I can get a burger with a little pink in it. Finally I asked if they could make me a new one, medium. The manager brought it out and within minutes came back to check on me. She noticed it still was on the done side but I said it was better and would be good enough. Although it still was slightly more done than I preferred, this time it was super fresh and the mozzarella on it was amazing, so much better than my first burger. Thanks to the staff for making your customers happy!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a layover after a red eye flight.   This was my second time here while passing through Charlotte. I had a burger the first time and it was good. The service has been good and friendly both times, howeve  This breakfast was awful. The eggs were the only hot thing on the plate. Everything else was lukewarm at best.   Their rye bread tasted like cleaning solution, was partially toasted, and had the consistency of styrofoam. The sausage patties were dry, over cooked, and also had an odd flavor. I didn't eat them after the first bite."}
{"text":"Fried pickles!!!! they are fantastic!! thinly sliced and crispy, i could probably eat a whole basket.  We had a long wait but that was due to the party of 14.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful and kept checking to see if we were doing okay.  The burgers are huge and love the selections to build your own.  My combo might not have been the best but everything was tasty.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte I'd definitely hit this place up again."}
{"text":"It is bar food. I had the chicken burger and it was ok. The tots and spicy sauce were so yummy though! It's bar food expect bar food. I was not in a hurry but the person near me was and the waitress was super quick with food and ticket. I sat at the bar facing the window it is separate from the main bar that could make the difference."}
{"text":"If you can sit at the bar, I would suggest that. When we arrived we were told a table would be 15-20 minutes. I noticed 2 seats open at the bar and wuickly grabbed a sear. I was pleased with the service at the bar. The bartender was pleasant and made a pretty tasty, but strong, mixed drink for me. The prices are standard for beer, liquor and wine. My water cup was never empty and the bartender was really attentive.   I ordered a chicken burger with Swiss cheese  and chips. The burger was bland but the presentation was great. The chips were really good. Everything came out quickly and the atmosphere was laid back. They had a few basketball games on the TV's but it wasn't too noisy. Overall it's a good place to kill some time when you have a layover."}
{"text":"Was interning out at CLT airport and had to get a quick lunch. I like Bad Daddy's in Ballantyne, so I figured I'd try this one as well. I ordered at the to-go counter, and got a buzzer that worked all the way up and down C concourse (good range!). It buzzed in about 15 minutes, which is okay, not really fast, so if you're in a hurry, maybe not the best option.  I got the Western Burger with no onions, so it's a buffalo burger, cheese, and barbecue sauce. I got it as close to medium as possible, and I also got chips. The burger was delicious! Juicy and huge! Also it was medium rare, just how I like it. The barbecue sauce was really good. My only complaint would be maybe a bit much cheese, but just nitpicking. The chips were delicious as well.  Overall, give Bad Daddy's a try--it's probably the best restaurant in the airport!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes yes! Bad Daddy's is the best burger in Charlotte I have found by a mile. My typical order is a Western Burger (buffalo burger, barbecue sauce, cheese) without onion rings. They cook it at the minimum to a warm pink center, which is perfect for me. A lot of restaurants will only go well in NC since NC requires beef that is not ground at the restaurant to be at a certain temperature. The buns are soft and good, and the thick burgers are juicy and delicious.  Service, I've found, is always very good and consistent. Jared (or Jarod?) goes above and beyond to make sure his customers are happy. My mom once got onions (which she doesn't like) on her burger. A manager took it back and literally removed the onions from the bun and gave it back. Jared asked several times to take it back and then we ended up with a free milkshake. That's customer service and that's what keeps me coming back. Exceptional.  It can get really busy during the work week at lunch, and dinner is pretty crowded too. Weekends are a mess as well. Essentially, every time is a mess since it's so good! Give Bad Daddy's a shot next time you're in South Charlotte!"}
{"text":"There are some odd burger concoctions to choose from, such as the Sam I Am. But, overwhelmed with the dozens of options for condiments, toppings, etc., I found myself wishing there more crazy concoctions on the menu. When it comes to things like burgers and pizza, I play it pretty safe when it comes to choosing toppings.   Still, even the boring burger (with bacon, lettuce, onion, mayo, ketchup) I concocted myself was pretty good. The most memorable part of the meal though were the tater tops I chose as my side. They were really crispy and perfect.   When I went there for dinner, there was a big NFL game on TV. All eyes were locked on the TV screens. So if you're looking for a more elegant dinner, well, a place called BIg Daddy's is probably not the right pick."}
{"text":"I hardly ever eat at restaurants in airports due to bland food and ridiculous (even for a per diem traveler) prices.  I had a 90 minute layover recently on a trip to Canton Ohio and decided to get food before landing in Cleveland later that night due to the late hour.  As others have mentioned this location is very small and tight (can barely roll your roller bag through to get to seat)but the service was very efficient on the evening I was there and I was greeted and  seated within 3 minutes of arrival.  The menu looked very appetizing and there were a number of good salad and burger options.I ordered a Black Bean burger that not only was tasty and original but the fries (I love French Fries) were VERY VERY good. As a matter of fact in all my travels the only place I can think of that has better fries in the USA is Falafel's Drive In in San Jose.  I was so full after my decently priced meal that I slept all the way to wonderful Cleveland (God I hate traveling back east in the winter...that is why I moved to Phoenix to get away from snow yet I have to keep going back for clients in the Northeast in the dead of winter...cant complain though, those clients are great and good for business and I appreciate them) and vividly remember this meal as the highlight of this weeks trip.  I know that it is sad that a burger joint in an airport is the highlight of a business trip but hey business travel is all glamor right..."}
{"text":"I'd had a Kobe Sam I Am last week, with tater tots and that was great. Sat at the 'window' bar & had a friendly, helpful waitress.  This week, I sat at the window again, but ended up having to flag someone down to take my order - apparently, whoever had that section was on an extended break! The guy I flagged down was helpful, and the Kobe SAI w/ pimento & kalamata olives was awesome (would have preferred med-rare), but the sweet potato fries were atrocious - must've been left over from lunch (@4:45pm).  Won't go out of my way to go back again."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Burgers are always spot on. The Sam I am is amazing!  Fried pickles are delicious. Always sit at the bar because the  bartender Chuck, is fantastic. He is always in a good mood and is very attentive. Great asset to that store. Ticket times are sometimes long, but they are always busy, so I get it. 2 thumbs way up!!"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is my favorite burger spot. I love the taste and quality of their food. This location is situated in Birkdale Village. They have a nice large dining area and great outdoor patio. Parking is ample and service is good. So why three stars? I think the food is just better at their Easy Blvd location."}
{"text":"Well, this was definitely the worst meal I had on vacation. We ordered the texican chicken salad (lettuce, fried chicken, cilantro, onion, tomato, black beans, tortilla strips & corn with chipotle ranch dressing) and the fried pickles. The salad was bland and the lackluster dressing hardly added anything to it. In stark contrast, the fried pickles were SO salty, I couldn't finish them. Seriously, this may have been the saltiest food I've ever had. If the U.S. suddenly institutes a draft and you need to evade it, grab an order of these for a severe spike in your blood pressure. Otherwise, there is no reason to order these. We did have some pretty good local beer - I tried the Noda Jam Session, which was a pale ale with strong hops and a pretty cool hipstery can. Beer aside, I left here a sad daddy.* =(  *Admittedly I am no one's father, but I was still sad."}
{"text":"Came here last night and had a good time. The service was great. The menu has a lot of really cool burgers to choose from. I had the bad ass burger which had fried buttermilk bacon (pray for arteries) lol. It was really good. The bacon cheese burger on steroids is really good too. Overall I really enjoyed the place and food. It's in a perfect location where you can grab a bite to eat then walk over to catch a movie at the nearby theater."}
{"text":"I've heard so many people rave about bad daddy's and honestly it's pretty dang good! We came around lunchtime, we were seated quickly. I love how theirs an pad on each table, & you can request to create your own burger and there's also plennty of options/choices to choose from. I settled for the veggie burger(on the menu) and the tater tots for my side. Oh my god I freaking love tater tots, and these won my heart, they were perfectly crispy, you must get them! My burger was pretty good too, when I first bit into it, I had mistaken it for a beef patty rather than veggie Haha!! Overall I'm pretty happy with my experience at bad daddy's, good service, location awesome(5 mins away from me, oh jeez) and great burgers!"}
{"text":"This is the burger you're missing in your life! Bad Daddy's knows how to do it right when it comes to meeting your burger needs. This is my go-to spot anytime there is any celebratory dinner. The meal is always cooked to perfection.   One of my favorite things about their menu is the \"Create Your Own\" option. This allows you to custom build your own burger or salad just the way you like it. The servers are always very informative and helpful. I'm so glad they opened up one of these joints closer to my house so I can frequent there more often.   Now, I normally go with fries as my side but I decided to switch it up this time around and go with tater tots. Still a delicious side that you can dip in the housemade Bad Daddy's sauce.   I always enjoy my experience here and try to find any excuse to make it back there soon. One thing to note is the wait time. Generally this place is crowded every night of the week so prepare to wait 20-30 minutes to grab a seat. But like all great food...it is worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger on steroids is delicious.  Has a slight kick, but nothing that makes your mouth on fire. Didn't have to wait for a seat, but it was crowded (Friday at 4:45). Located right before gate C9. They have a take out window, too!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love Tatiana! She is so friendly and nice telling me all about the menu items. Delicious too!"}
{"text":"Day Two (and final) of my non-beef burger binge closed with a bite at Bad Daddy's.  The Frenchie has such promise: a very salty turkey patty covered in oozing brie, sliced apples, applewood smoked bacon, garlic mayo and the phone number of a local cardiologist. This is supposed to feel healthier, ain't it? The flavors work, remarkably well, and I wolfed down the 'wich faster than Albert Camus' literary protagonist's descent in to madness. (L'Etranger reference +1)  Three cheers for the slaw, which held a hefty dose of caraway seed (?) and a proper crunch. One cheer for noticing the seeds in the apple slices before taking a bite -- there were a bunch. Service was on point at first, then steadily waned as the meal progressed. Had to chase down the server for a check.   I'd order the Frenchie again, but wouldn't necessarily clear a path to Bad Daddy's. Then again, it's an airport, and A-OK may be tough to come by."}
{"text":"Got here on a late Saturday night and got seated really quick. Our server mentioned the specials and it seems they change on a monthly basis. The salads are really fresh, burgers are cooked to perfection and also offers build your own. Great variety of ingredients and a casual environment. Awesome!"}
{"text":"My waiter was amazing !! I ordered the juicy jay beer and the Catina black bean burger with sweet potato fries. Everything was amazing!!! It was fresh, hot, and quick. This was my first time here and I'll def be back !! I ate too fast to take pictures"}
{"text":"Wow!  VERY GOOD!  These burgers are crazy good and the sweet potato fries are excellent.  The next time I'm in Charlotte I will go to Bad Daddy's again!"}
{"text":"If you like terrible service than this is a place for you. Went here 6/3/17 for dinner with my wife and daughter. We got sat in a booth and told we can't use a high chair, booster seats only. Then our waiter took our drink orders they were 2 waters........15 mins later we got our drinks and he took our order, 2 burgers and that was the last time we saw our waiter.......45 mins later someone else brought our food out and other waitresses were refilling our drinks while our waiter gave great service to the table of girls behind us. The food wasnt great but not once did our waiter check on us and about another 30 mins later I had to ask a random waitress for our bill because our waiter didn't care to take care of us. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The decor, service and food are all great.  You can build your own salad or burger, and their menu items are also great. Portions are generous, you won't leave hungry! Each entree is between $10-$15 dollars, averaging $13. They have a gluten-free menu, and the staff is very caring and careful about the allergy. I would definitely go here for a burger and tater tots if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"First trip to this location, as always Bad Daddy's delivers! Didn't happen to notice anything overly special compared to other Bad Daddy's locations as far as decor or special offerings so if you've been to one they all fit the \"neatly modern/rustic\" blend, but honestly who cares about that, we came for ground dead animal on a bun! I decided to be different this trip, they always have really unique awesome sounding specials but I usually skip them as Bad Daddy's has some of the best burgers money can buy so when I come I have a tough time not having a bovine fix.  But anyways today's special was a shrimp burger....hmmm? Never have even heard of this.  Had salmon burgers, had veggie burgers, even had Bad Daddy's tuna burger(really good FYI) but never heard of shrimp burger.  I was intrigued enough to order it.  Also the attraction of something new as well as the way it was prepared had me locked in.  On a great sweet flavored bun, on a bed of tomato and shredded lettuce, then topped with an avocado corn relish spread.  Officially turned up to 11! I inhaled that sandwich, (no easy feat due to the size could barely get my mouth around it) and did not even stop to breath pretty sure because the flavor was so good.  After shrimp burger was no more all that remained was  juicy messy hands and a pile of the delicious avocado and corn relish that fell off to the plate.   Being the innovator I am I used their amazing sweet potato fries (always perfectly cooked and salted) to make sure none of the amazingness went to waste.  Somehow it was even better than their normal spud dip, almost blasphemy I know! Another thing I love about Bad Daddy's aside from craft burgers is the craft beer selection.  Unfortunately since this was a work-hour lunch trip with my regional manager there was no partaking despite the fact that was the subject of half the convo, but cannot write about this place and not mention the good specials decent selection and appreciation for innovative crafty brews to accompany their delicious burgers. Sorry for the play by play recap in this review but I wanted no details left out.  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey burger with sweet pot fries and it was pretty good. Wanted to try them out and their spiked shakes because I got a shake on my last layover. For $7, I was impressed with the size. But I was not happy about the spiked shake. So much for wanting one. It cost more than my burger and fries. For $13.50, I need more shake and a little more alcohol. Don't get sucked in, proceed with caution."}
{"text":"I did not expect to find an excellent black bean veggie burger in an airport, so I'm rewarding that find with many stars. Outside of San Francisco, the vegetarian food options at airport restaurants are usually gross, grilled cheese, or involve asking if chicken can be left out. The burger was really good, the avocado topping was fresh, and the sweet potato fries were lovely. Also, alcoholic milkshakes.  Service was not particularly attentive but they also seem understaffed and very busy. We got in and out in about 40 minutes. If there were only outlets/charging stations I would give Bad Daddy's five stars.   (Whose idea was the name Bad Daddy? Smack yourself in the face.)"}
{"text":"This was a great place to spend a layover. The highlight was my waitress who was very conscious of people's need to make their flights, so started her service by asking how quickly I needed to run. I was deep into a book, so she was so polite and tried as much as possible not to disturb me. I ordered the club with tater tots on the side. The club was big and full of thick cuts of chicken, ham and bacon. The tater tots were just out of the fryer and came with a great chipotle dipping sauce. The prices were very reasonable for the airport, and the location was right next to my connecting AA flights."}
{"text":"I ate here just once at lunch time.  When I was asked to meet for lunch at Big Daddy's, I thought, \"Crap, I hate fast food.\"  Not only that, I figured this would be a greasy, sleepy afternoon type lunch.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  I was honestly pleasantly surprised.  This was far from that greasy burger joint I had pictured just hours before going there.  This was an a-la-carte, somewhat healthy place to eat.  I ordered a traditional burger with a bunch of trimmings --when I say a bunch, I really mean about 4-5 and that was about 30% of what you could actually get on the burger.  The burger was cooked nicely and was extremely juicy and tasty.  In addition, I got a side salad.  Again, with an a-la-carte style order and literally, you could get anything on this thing --including several different kinds of lettuces.  The service was very prompt and the food was out very quickly --though there were only two of us for lunch.  The restaurant seemed nice and clean and the staff were very polite.  The restaurant was a very causal environment and pretty loud --a perfect place to take kids, especially crazy one's like mine.   I'll certainly be going back to this place and I'm looking forward to it, too."}
{"text":"We have been here twice in the past week and VERY pleased!!  If your server is tied up in something else, someone will come over and ask if they can get us anything while we wait.  Great team work!   My favorite is the Cantina burger- best bean burger I've ever had & I've met a few;)  Nachos are fantastic.  Chili is delish!!!  Drink specials every day and I love they serve tall boys!!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I love bad Daddys burger bar. This location in birkdale village also serves breakfast.  One of my favorite places for breakfast on a Saturday morning. I get the tucos bad wrap (don't let the name scare you). It is a breakfast burrito wrap, it's huge has scrambled eggs sausage fresh avocado black bean and topped with salsa and sour cream.  At lunch or dinner the bacon cheeseburger on steroids is what you want!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible for take out. Their bartender is also the person who does take out and is ALWAYS overwhelmed. Even on the weekend it seems there's only one person doing both. I've eaten in the restaurant before and the table service is pretty good; it's just their take out system. I've literally seen my food come out and sit on the counter behind the bar for 10 plus minutes before anyone even checks to see who's order it is. If you ask the bartender (especially the guy at lunch with the beard and the Union Jack boxers (because I can see his underwear) to check for you he says he's really busy and he will do it soon. :) I already paid! All you have to do is hand it to me. This is NOT the first time as I never give negative reviews from a one off event. It's every time."}
{"text":"After a long international flight, my husband and I were happy to try out Bad Daddy's during our layover. The food was phenomenal! I got the Sam I Am and he ordered the Western Burger. Giving 4 stars because the service was subpar, but overall, great burgers!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum....that sums up Bad Daddy's for me! Everything I've had here is delicious. The Cantina burger is awesome! Great service and family friendly at this location. We absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"My bf and son ordered the burgers and it truly looked delicious. I don't eat red meat so I got the chicken Caesar salad and it was very tasty. Fast service for a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Best burgers in CharMeck area.  I love that they've added this location in addition to the East Blvd spot; fits very well in Birkdale!"}
{"text":"All I can said is OMG!  Being from NJ we had know idea where to eat after going to NASCAR hall of fame. This place is 3 miles away and worth every bite.  I had the mushroom burger and it was the juiciest burger I've ever ate along with sweet potato fries and slamming good coleslaw. Oh yeah and my LL teas is what the dr ordered.  My waitress was super and we even went home with some badass tee shirts. I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Love the burgers here .. and spending time with friends and family  .. Daniel is awesome."}
{"text":"Best damn fried pickles ever. The service is amazing. Plus, the burgers will have you saying \"oh my god\" . Kyle was an excellent server here in Charlotte"}
{"text":"I had a really positive experience here. The place was busy but only a 15 min table wait. I opted for immediate seating at the bar. Great tots and good burger. Would go back and no hesitation recommending."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and wasn't disappointed at all. It's hard to find vegetarian options and their black bean burger is delicious. Definitely get it crispy. Haven't tasted a black bean burger yet that was mushy and this one was perfect. Also the salads are great as well. You get your choice of 7 add ins. Very filling."}
{"text":"Awwwww yeah, tater-tot me. Momma riccota burger and bacon cheese on steroids, two of my faves here.  It's not easy finding good food in Charlotte.  If you're a burger fan, you should go here.  The burgers here are consistently the best in Charlotte from my experience, and I have tried a lot of the \"Charlotte's best burger\" restaurants.  If you have a negative experience here, I urge you to try again.  If you know of a better burger place (please don't say Liberty), please let me know.  It's always busy here, so expect to wait around for 30-40 minutes.  Thanks."}
{"text":"BEST veggie burger in town! Holy cow. Make sure to get it crispy though. I also usually get a custom side salad as my side and it is really the best side salad around. The ambience is fun and the service is good and fast."}
{"text":"Everyone has just found pure happiness in their burgers, tots and sweet potato fries! Some think how can you improve on sweet potato fries but they are cooked to perfection with the soft center and crisp savory crust...just heaven!!! Bad Daddy's is a Baaaaaad Daddy!!!!!"}
{"text":"My Food Was DELICIOUS!!!!!  I stopped eating beef a few months ago but as soon as I walked in and saw others eating their food I knew what time it was. my friend and I ordered and the food arrived hot and quick, my burger cooked to perfection. I had the fried mozzarella burger with bacon and I would have ordered a second . I'll be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"I LOVED THE FRENCHIE! Turkey burger, bacon, apple, Gouda, mayo...and it was not small in size. So delicious and worth every penny. We did take out so no comment about the service but there was no wait to pick up our food!"}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to actually sit and enjoy the food at Big Daddy's and I can't wait to go back. Until this point, I have been forced to survive on take-out Big Daddy's brought home by my hubs. Of course, he always brings home at least one of my favorites - sweet potato fries, fried pickles, or a milkshake, but the food tastes even better right from the kitchen.   My good friend and I decided to have a girls' lunch with three of our little people. We waited a few minutes for a table outside (the inside seemed a little too loud for chit chat and it was a gorgeous day!) and were instantly greeted by a super nice server. Although I have eaten food from Big Daddy's I had never held that large menu in my hand and was initially overwhelmed a bit - food, drink, food, drink? Ahhh! There was a little too much information to process so I settled on a glass of water and an order of fried pickles for the table. Almost before I could take a look back at the menu, the pickles appeared as if by magic. It truly seemed like a mere 2 minutes passed before our server took our order and the pickles and five plates appeared at our crowded table.   The pickles were the perfect way to start our meal but I have to admit that my friend and I faltered miserably when the time came to order our food. Pathetically, we both ordered the same salad - the Texicana - because it really sounded amazing. Chopped greens, black beans, corn, shredded tortilla chips, and chicken... doesn't that sound like a great Saturday afternoon meal? Our girls were more adventurous - one split the salad with me and ordered a side of fries (I like her style), another child ordered the chicken fingers - they looked and tasted great, and the third child ordered sliders. The sliders came out a little bit over done but I'm sure it is hard to cook those little burgers for the kiddos.   If you are looking for a family friendly restaurant, pay attention: The kids meals were served with a huge side of fruit - I would bring my children back to this restaurant simply because I was so impressed with the side of fruit - there must have been six different types of fruits arranged on a decent sized plate. A healthy mom's dream... The side of fruit totally offset the plate of fried pickles that started off the meal - I am sure of it.   We ordered a milkshake to take home to dad - my turn to be the one bringing home the take-out ... I ordered him the chocolate caramel milkshake - it was a special that day and it was delicious. I have had a very hard time finding a decent milkshake since moving to Charlotte and this is the best I have found so far. I am looking forward to enjoying the patio again - and hopefully being a little more adventurous with the menu!"}
{"text":"Anywhere else this would be two stars but +1 for the airport curve.    They serve very hearty salads with fresh greens and you can add grilled chicken.  The chicken isn't spectacular and the burgers look overdone but the scene is fun and rock n' roll, the servers prompt, and it beats the bad packages or faux fancy salad options in the airport."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened today, but the service was horrible. The food even worse, which is a surprise since I normally come here about 3-4 times per month and it has been a pleasant experience.   They don't even seemed to care actually and it was obvious they lack leadership. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great place and customer service. I ordered the Patty Melt and it was very tasty. The fires were a bit greasy, but manageable to say the least. The atmosphere was nice and location is certainly a plus. I'll return."}
{"text":"Best damn burger I've had in a long damn time. Great service. Great food.  We're here from Soutern California and greatly appreciate the food & hospitality."}
{"text":"Wow! Great burgers of all shapes and sizes with really tasty adult milk shakes to tempt and tease. The staff was friendly and atmosphere felt appropriate for what they're slinging... Maybe best described as Nouveau Americana? I ordered the Banh Mi Pork Burger and it was excellent. The slight vinegary toppings were a great counterbalance to the savory patty. On the side, I had sweet potato fries and they were some of the better I've had. 2 at our table also ordered the spiked milkshakes and they were really tasty. Next time I'm in Charlotte, I'll be asking to go back."}
{"text":"Great place! My husband got his favorite shake for free for his birthday.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and the hand cut fries. Service was outstanding. ..she was able to keep up with our drinks.  We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here one time and thought it was fantastic! Great burger and beer selection. I will definitely be going back.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is the price is a little high."}
{"text":"This place is delicious if you are looking for any kind of burger!  I have been there a few times, and both times had the lettuce wrap burger.  I didn't miss the bun at all!    I had for the first time, jalepeno bacon here!!!  OMG, it was awesome.  I love jalepenos.  I love bacon.  the combination rocks!  I did a small side salad for a side.  It's fun, you get to build it from your greens to toppings to dressing!  I know they have great drink specials on certain nights.  This is a super casual spot with a small patio.  Both times I have been I was with a group, and we all had a great time!  Not a date spot, but casual eats for sure!"}
{"text":"So I was casually mentioning to my neighbor that I was so excited for the new bad daddy's in waverly to open and she tells me there's been a bad daddy's in ballantyne all along! We came here on a Friday around 6:30 and we had about a 10 minutes wait. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks, they have great bar prices!   Next, we were seated and given menus. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly and had great timing. I ordered the Pittsburgh inspired burger and hubs for the BBQ burger. We both loved our burgers, they were cooked perfectly. The sides were also amazing, I love the truffle tots!! We will definitely work this into our normal routine, this is a great location and great vibes!"}
{"text":"Food was solid, but the service was outstanding.  Ashley was fast, fun and took care any request in spite of the crowd.  Neighbor table commented on how great she was as well."}
{"text":"Giving this place five stars on the first night. I do apologize the only picture I have is of the wreckage after my husband and I ate. Our grass-fed burgers were so tasty we stopped talking to each other when the food came out.   We both decided on a create-your-own burger . I was very pleased with the variety of choices you get with this option; much more than any other burger bar I've been too. I tried horseradish mayo and Bad Daddy sauce on the side of my burger. Veggie, black bean, regular beef, turkey, and tuna burgers are also options .  Our sides were Tater tots and onion rings . Tots were fried perfectly and rings were larger than average.   On this Thursday and every Thursday, they have $3.50 North Carolina beers on tap, which was a nice compliment to our meal.   The atmosphere is casual, and small. Our wait was relatively short and most definitely worth it. Cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good flavor, but the bacon cheesseburguer w/steroids is way to big for a girl.  A little bit greasy, because they are soooo big! Tater tots good too."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Got seated right away. Our waitress Tiana was quick and knew the menu. I ordered a magic mushroom burger. In reality it was a good portabello burger. I found one sliver of a shitake. No morels or any other shroom. The blackbean burger was good.  The potato chips and sweet potato fries came out delicious. I am not sure how soon I would go back."}
{"text":"Living near Winston-Salem, I've eaten at the Bad Daddy's location there many times over the last few years. I've eaten at this Birkdale location a handful of times during that period- usually meeting my sister/brother-in-law, who live nearby, for lunch or dinner. The biggest thing that sets this location apart from the W-S location is the consistency of the service. While I enjoy the burgers at both places very much, the service at this location is consistently great! Today I met my sister and her two small children... one of which is 11 months old and can be loud. Our server today was so nice, both to the adults and the kids. She was very patient as my 7-year old niece decided what she wanted. I'm guessing she was college-age, but she couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly.   It probably goes without saying, but their burgers today, as always, were juicy, huge and delicious. I got my favorite \"Sam I Am\" today, which has an egg, ham, and cheese. I went with the tater tots, but their fries are always a good choice as well. My sister loved her burger \"make your own\" salad as well. Another good experience like I've come to expect from this Bad Daddy's location!"}
{"text":"Great burger bar.  Had the badass burger with applewood smoked bacon dipped in buttermilk and deep fried,tator tots and a 20oz craft beer. Good service and food came out quick even though it was busy."}
{"text":"Did the Wednesday bring your own mug thing and it was AWESOME. Just bring some sort of mug-like container (with a handle, we brought pitchers) and they'll fill it up (up to 40 oz) for either 4, 6, or 8 bucks (dependent upon chosen beer).   Perfect way to start the end of the week. Drink up!"}
{"text":"If we could give 10 stars we would! This is our favorite place to eat in Charlotte. Awesome and delicious food but even better management! We live 5 minutes from the East Blvd location but drive 20 minutes to Ballantyne just because it's so good! Everybody in the service industry should strive to treat their customers with the care that John does at the Ballantyne location. We have never had a bad experience! Tom and Tanner"}
{"text":"Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon for late lunch. It was packed. Luckily - no waiting. We ordered the BT Snickered shake which was awesome. It's a must have - highly recommend trying that out. For food, we ordered a cantina burger with tater tots & a pittsburger with chicken patty & sweet potato fries. Also, recommend trying the tater tots & the sweet potato fries. This was the 1st time that I tried tater tots. But, I've had the sweet potato fries at multiple places and these were quite good. One thing to plan before hand for is the lack of parking space."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to this location. Their burgers are amazing and the sides are not too shabby either. I tried the tots last time and decided to give the onion rings a go on this visit. I was not disappointed. My only issue is that I'm so stuffed afterwards that don't have room for a milkshake. I'm making it a goal to order one on my next visit because I imagine it's just as great as their other products."}
{"text":"I have ordered the Texican Chicken Salad more than once because it is one of the few salads I actually crave!  It's a bit spicy, but not too much.  Best burgers in Ballantyne area!  Try the bad daddy sauce."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is a small chain located in Colorado, North Carolina, and South Carolina; approximately 23 locations as of June 2017.  According to their website, they first opened in 2007 in Charlotte, NC with a passion for hamburgers!  This particular location was located in the Charlotte International Airport in Concourse C, Gate 4.    I tried their Breakfast Burger (basic burger topped with ham, fried egg, bacon, and American cheese); burger patty ordered medium.  YUM!    Tip:  Give yourself at least an hour before your flight departure.  The burger took about 30 minutes to make.    ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok- nothing outstanding. Food took forever to get to table- about 30 min. Burger was good and fries were good. Not sure that it is worth the price. I would prefer Foster's."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful family dinner here!! Thanks so much to all the staff that treated us so kindly from the moment we entered the place til the time we left stuffed and happy. I thoroughly enjoyed my mushroom magic turkey burger and the margaritas were awesome. I had 2 which is the limit:) which is probably a good thing for me. Every body found something they liked on the menu and we devoured the fried pickles appetizer. Thanks for a great night!!"}
{"text":"Having just finished the college tour right up the street at Queens,  appetites were revved up and the choice was an old familiar Bad Daddy's.   We've been to this location several times PY (Pre Yelp) and we've become accustomed to this particular locations food and service quality, but it doesn't hold at other locations in CLT unfortunately.     The parking here though is awful and during the week,  \"fuh-get-aboutit,\"  unless you arrive at 1130a.  But being the weekend it was a bit better but not by much and we lucked out with an open spot.  There's ample seating inside and out albeit can be a bit tight inside.  We were promptly sat and didn't take long for the drinks, placing the app order, and the lunch selections.  Choices this time were fried pickles,  all American burger with onion rings,  bison burger,  and all American with tots.  It was shark eyes all around.   Those who've read my post know that is my saying to describe the frenzy or rather enjoyment due to the quality of the food,  i.e., when sharks feed they have a protective film that extends to cover their eyes to protect against the food particles/blood etc. from damaging their eyes,  so you get the idea :).  Yep, so the fam had shark eyes all around  ;)!  They really enjoyed the food.  Total came to 62.00 including tip for 3 people and an app, so it's a bit pricey imo, but this particular location serves good quality food with good service and has done so consistently so its worth it."}
{"text":"The mixed green lettuce on my salad had to be the worst I've had here which is disappointing because normally this location is solid. Even the fruit tasted plain, like different colored chunks of water.  Even our pattys were without flavor.  Just all around bad experience.  The chips and pimento were ok.  The pimento was a bit too garlicky Well, hope the next time is better."}
{"text":"This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. We waited 45 minutes for our food (nothing but simple appetizers). The waiter did not once come over to explain what was taking so long or see if we needed refills or anything at all. We tried to get his attention multiple times and he would look at us then turn his back. When the food finally came out the waiter dropped it and ran again. The order was incorrect and the fries were still frozen in the center. We asked several other employees for help and were told we needed to talk to our server- this is a tiny restaurant so these employees could have easily relayed a message if nothing else. Multiple other tables got up and left due to no one acknowledging them at all after they had to seat themselves (the hostess was too busy openly applying makeup with the takeout window cashier). Awful awful experience. The Charlotte airport has a lot of food options- go elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a small gathering after work. Had high expectations for the place, good beer, cozy atmosphere. However, I left extremely disappointed. The fried pickles were extremely salty, the coleslaw was over seasoned and the Tuna burger was well under expectations. Normally a place with decent food can win me back with exceptional service but that wasn't the case at Bad Daddy's. If you are in the mood for a burger, bar food or beer head over to Taco Mac instead... Take it from someone who dines out 5 evenings a week."}
{"text":"BAD ASS BURGER & TRUFFLE FRIES.   Just ate here for the first time tonight. It now holds #2 best burger I've ever had in the country. Haha. Buttermilk fried bacon. Holy moly.   The truffle fries might've been even better than the burger. I'd have to limit my intake of this simply for health reasons. Haha. But this  would be a good treat on those \"off\" days."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from post mates. Bacon cheeseburger on steroids was amazing. Perfectly cooked and tons of bacon. I definitely  recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a real burger joint that goes beyond the normal burger. I ate Emilio's Chicken Sandwich with tater tots and enjoyed both very much. My server said it was his favorite too!!  The atmosphere is casual, people friendly, and you can get beer there too. I have got this place on my list for my next business trip."}
{"text":"Visiting the Queen City last week and found this place on our tour of the city. Tour guide gave it high marks.   Came back to check it out.  Some good and some bad.  Good~ Burgers were delish!  Plain and simple.  Good ~ Service, friendly and helpful with questions on the menu.  Good ~ Great selection of beers  Bad ~ Sides - Home made potato chips over cooked and greasy.  Onion strings cold, dry and over cooked.  Tasted as if they were under a hot lamp for awhile.    Bad ~ Parking sucked but burgers made up for it! :)  Would come again if ever in Charlotte.  That is how good the burger was!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. I like the menu choice to build your own burger or build your own salad. Their potato chips are home made. My dining mates  and I  ordered  burgers and a build a salad. We were hungry and I forgot to snap photos.  We ordered a buffalo burger which was tender ,  enjoyable mushroom burger , a plain burger  and a  small build a salad. The burgers each came with a side of  one choice of  hand cut fries, tater tots, sweet potato fries or home made chips. Salads with choices of fruit, protein, vegetable additions etc.  Service was friendly, prices moderate. Buffalo burger almost $14, magic mushroom burger $12.  Small salad $5 Food was fresh and tasty. Lots of other menu choices for specialty burgers , salads and variety of other sides, and beverages"}
{"text":"Excuse the stereotype, but Damn the chicken wings were so small as a black man ordering chicken (my credentials) I felt almost insulted. Or is it some sort of conspiracy to limit the amount of time black people spend here by having the tiniest of tiny chicken wings !?!!!? The beer was good though lol ...that is all"}
{"text":"Really good food and selection.   Jessica,  our server,  was excellent.   Very attentive.   Refills,  dirty plates all take care of by her and others.   I got a small salad and asked for larger bowl or plate,  which she accommodated.   Had a salad before,  and bowl was way too small.   Great amount of salad ingredients for a small!"}
{"text":"Love the service, the food, ambiance. I don't know what else to say coz their burgers are the best I have eaten in the whole world. Perfect flavor, juicy...it's just perfect"}
{"text":"No idea how these guys got 3 stars...they deserve more based upon my experience. I was on layover at CLT and had the urge for something a bit greasy and Bad Daddy's was happy to comply. I had the Western burger and fries at the recommendation of my server and tried one of the local NoDa brews as well. I could not have been happier...the burger was sweet and saucy and fantastic. The paper towels on the table are there for a reason...this stuff is messy and delicious."}
{"text":"This was a really great place to hang out while waiting for my flight in Charlotte. We had already had lunch so we were looking for a place where we could watch a game, drink a beer and chill for a couple of hours. We ordered the sweet potato fries and they might have been the most delicious sweet potato fries I have ever tried. They were crispy and thin, but still had enough of a gooey center to keep me going back. The dipping sauce was a good compliment also. I am sure that the rest of their menu was just as well executed, and the options listed were extensive and sounded amazing. The server was not bothered at all by us occupying his table for two hours while not ordering much more than a couple of beers. The decor was cool, the walls were covered in TVs and there was a large window overlooking the tarmac.  The space offered tables as well as places for solo diners to eat. All in all, this place offered an excellent option for airport dining."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some non-standard burgers and local brew! And you don't even need to take my word for it--a self-proclaimed burger connoisseur I met in California, upon hearing that I was from Charlotte, instantly inquired about Bid Daddy's Burgers. Talk about a national reputation!  The place a bit small, so be prepared for a possible wait and as others have mentioned, it can be noisy in there. As a tip, just sit at the bar if it is available.   I had to get the bad ass burger, based not only on name but also on the inclusion of buttermilk fried bacon. Yes, you heard me right. What is buttermilk fried bacon? Breaded bacon fried to crispy perfection. It is better than it sounds.  My girlfriend got a plain old burger and she wasn't that impressed. Indeed, it lacked much flavor in general. So, the take home here is to go wild and get some of the crazy stuff that while logically shouldn't be in a burger, makes it simply delicious.  They lost a star because 1) could get their specialty fries with the burger (really?!) and 2) my big ass burger came out missing one of its two pattys. How can you mess that up?"}
{"text":"Been to many of their locations and the food is always good.  There is always a good variation of options to choose from.    Burgers - Always very tasty.   I am a purest and tend to choose the bacon cheeseburger.  It is always fresh and always served with lettuce,tomato, onions and pickle.    The Surfs Up Tuna burger is something that I always get when the mood hits.  It's ground tuna with different spices.  I highly recommend.    I Tried the Grilled Chicken sandwich for the first time during my last visit.  The chicken was good just right and had good flavor.   All of the above come with various sides.  I lean toward the tater tots.  Probably just getting back to my childhood.  Again these are not over done and something I enjoy.    Overall we eat here in a frequent basis and never had an issue.  Will continue to frequent when I need a burger fix."}
{"text":"Bad experience and we havent sat down yet. We have a party of 6 and they tell us 20 minutes no big deal we are waiting. We come to find out after 30 minutes that there are 3 large families waiting before us. Ahhhhhh, its gonna be longer than 20 minutes.  Dont lie to us tell the truth please.  For a restaurant that only has a few large tables the hostesses sit 2 tops at a large 6 top table twice although there are 3 families waiting for 6 tops.  I am a big fan of this place but thr manager is not managing the wait and seat I very well at all.  Food was excellent as usual but the hostess stand needs some major training. If you have a table larger than 4 I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  Even for an airport restaurant.  I felt like I was forever waiting for something here first and foremost.  My bartender, who wasn't rude, but wasn't Mr. Personality either, seemed at times to be overworked.  But now that I think about it, did he really need to go get that beer keg in the middle of making my spiked milkshake?  Probably not, but I don't know.    This happened time and time again during my time here.  My black bean burger was tasty, and I loved the consistency, BUT it completely fell apart as soon as I bit into it.  Therefore, I was the freak eating my burger with a fork and knife.  It just didn't taste the same...probably because everyone was staring at me.  The regular French Fries left something to be desired.  Also, I had read in another review that this was fairly inexpensive, that was not the case here.  My spiked shake was $13.00, here I was thinking that it was seven, but no, that was the regular shake with no alcohol.  It was delicious, but not $13.00 delicious.  I am going to stop typing now, because as I write this I am starting to get angry and will change my star rating to one."}
{"text":"We are HUGE Bad Daddy's fans and we were extremely excited to see that this location popped up closer to home. We've been to the Terminal location, Dilworth and Birkdale Village and have had wonderful experiences at all of them. The newest location close to Concord Mills is a welcome addition.  I decided to go on opening night, which might have been a mistake. The wait to get a table was only 10 minutes, but the kitchen was extremely backed up. It took about 2 hours to get 2 burgers, a side of fries, and some coleslaw to our table. Our server was extremely sweet and offered to comp some beverages for us, but we stuck to our waters and waited on and on...  To be honest, IT'S TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT. I had the Magic Mushroom burger on a lettuce wrap. I think there are 4 different kinds of mushrooms on this burger. The swiss cheese was melted perfectly, and it all mixed together with a garlic aoili and arugula mix, HEAVEN! The coleslaw is not something I would order again. It had bits of raw red onion in it that were a little too much onion overload for me. My boyfriend did not stray from his normal Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids order, and 3 days later he's still talking about how good it was.  I somewhat anticipated a slight discount (10% off?) because we had to wait so long for our food, but none the less we left 3 hours later happy and fed.   Welcome to the neighborhood Bad Daddys! Once you get your opening week kinks out we will be sure to be back."}
{"text":"BEST burger in Charlotte hands down. Fun combinations, and easy to eat Paleo here. The wings are also really really good (nice and crispy). It's usually slammed on the weekends, but they offer pick-up service from the bar which is great. All of the Bad Daddy's locations are good, but we frequent this one most often."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers & tater tots.  Great place for lunch or to take the kids.  We first experienced Bad Daddy's near downtown Charlotte over 6 years ago (before they expanded & changed their name, when they were Big Daddy's) & have been a fan ever since.  Love having them in Huntersville now and we visit at least a couple of times a month for dinner with the kids.  We also stop in frequently for informal business lunches."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer that if you're going to put your best menu item in the name of your restaurant, you better make it good...damn good.  If that's the case, this place should be called Bad Daddy's Burger & Tater Tot Bar.  At this point, I'm starting to become a regular at this place.  Their burgers are consistently good and you will NOT leave hungry.  The tater tots on the side are a great accompaniment to a burger.  Golden brown and full of deliciousness.  I highly doubt they make their own tots in house, but at least they cook them perfectly.  I've also had their salads, and that side of spicy ranch dressing certainly has a kick to it.  But aside from the food, there are two reasons why this place stands out to me.  First, if you're trying to eat healthy, you can get a salad on the side instead of tots/fries.  Second, they have make-your-own options for both Salads and Burgers.  Not only can you get what you want, but if you want to eat healthy, you can make your own food choices while your friend stuffs their face.  Service is OK.  Everyone is really friendly, but it can sometimes be a while if you're trying to flag down your waiter/waitress.  Go early if you don't want a long wait!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes! One of the best burger joints we've ever visited. They have lots of options- from toppings to buns to lettuce burgers. They're choice if sides are great. I had the chips and I really liked them."}
{"text":"The worst costumer service, my fries were cold and salty. My black bean burger was cold and I barely had enough big daddy's sauce. Very underwhelmed by this place. Beer was good."}
{"text":"Great All American food and beer joint.  Found this place on Yelp and decided to partake.  While parking was a challange, once inside the atmosphere made up for the hike in the cold.    They have a great bar and our server was real nice.  Not to keen on the beer selection, but they have every necessity for every adult beverage you could desire.  I especially love the menu. Great selection of burgers. Love the patty melt and the southern burger.  We got our food to go since the beer was a bit weak, but I am really happy with the grub and that makes all the difference.  Kudos on the burgers, tots, and house chips."}
{"text":"This place doesn't get voted \"Best Burger in Town\" for nothing!  The menu has something for everyone, even vegetarians.  I recommend the White Hut and tater tots, but there are more than enough options to customize your own burger just the way you like it.  They even have a taco burger!  My only complaint is that the place isn't bigger!  As packed as the place stays, it can feel a little claustrophobic in there. Try to get a table at the back or sit outside.  [EDIT]  Just went again last night and had the Western Burger.  It's a buffalo patty with BBQ sauce, delicious onion straws, and cheese.  I'm willing to go out on a limb and say it just might have been the best burger I've had in Charlotte to date! [/EDIT]"}
{"text":"Who put bacon in the queso? They did - jalapeno bacon to be exact and it's realllly damn good.  My first visit to this location was good as expected - the layout is a little weird/cramped but it's probably because space in this neighborhood is at a premium ( you put things where you have to put them) . The bathrooms are a little too close to the drink prep stations and you feel like you're going to crash into the waitstaff.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich is a giant, delicious bird beast! An amazing sandwich! Order it without hesitation!  I had the Mama Ricotta today - fresh mozzarella, pesto, tomato and pepperoncini, cooked perfect medium (paired with a Triple C 3C IPA).  Two of my favorite things about Bad Daddy's - 1) they nail the temperature on my burger every time I order (and they're juicy to boot) 2) the adult Milkshakes - Cookie and Cream with Bailey's in it - yum - completely, wonderfully, delightfully excessive and decadent, but a must do - even if you have to share... okay so I thought of a third, 3) the tots - holy cow the tots - fresh, crispy, delicious - don't know if they air fry, oven bake, partially deep fry - I don't care because they are pretty close to the perfect tot."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy - thus far you have not let me down. On New Years Day, when many were closed, YOU WERE OPEN.  My friends from out of town were hungry and I thought of you (did you think of me too?). I knew you had something that would please everyone.  Ring, ring. What's going on? A party of 12 was no problem and was quickly seated on the toasty, heated patio.  Your awesome selection of local craft beers gave me bragging rights (drink local!) and my friends a sampling of what Charlotte has to offer.  Everyone was very happy with their burgers and sandwiches. I myself, finally conquered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids (that's really the name), a perfect medium rare, and lived to tell about it. As if that wasn't enough, the \"adult\" Mudslide milkshake went down so easy, my belly didn't know what hit it! Boom! Complete Satisfaction and Satiation!  I left fat and happy like a real American! Hell yeah!!"}
{"text":"While on a brief layover at the Charlotte airport, I was on the hunt for some vegetarian friendly grub that would hold me over until I arrived home later that evening. After a quick browse of their menu which is posted on the wall, I decided on this place since they had a black bean burger option. My friends and I had originally wanted to dine in as it seemed pretty upbeat and happenin' but the wait time was too long and we still had a plane to catch!  So my friends decided on snackin' elsewhere while I took my chances and ordered from their take out counter.   After placing my order (black bean burger and tator tots), I stood waiting for my number to be called out. I think it took about 25 minutes which seems a little frustrating since I didn't even order anything with meat but whatever.  The woman at the counter was friendly and on top of things for the most part. If you need any condiments or cutlery to go, they are right there to the left for you to grab. My black bean burger was goodt- I was able to pick the kind of bread,  opted for simple and just had the basic lettuce/onion/tomato/pickle with pepperjack cheese. The tator tots came with a side of their signature chipotle sauce which tasted like BBQ sauce to me.      This was pretty solid airport food. Just know that depending on the time of day, there will be a wait- even at takeout!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  My meal: BACON CHEESEBURGER ON STEROIDS*s and it definitely was. ***MUST TRY**** Side: Sweet potato fries ***yummy! (next time I'll try their tater tots, which everyone next to us was ordering as well.  Time gone: Lunch time  My party and I sat outside on the porch. It was nice out, but got breezy after a while, but it was 74, but it's February, what to expect. Noticed they had a plastic partition, so this patio is probably year round and can be protected from the elements if necessary. They also had a TV showing sports.  Inside I noticed a full bar, nicely stocked shelves. Have to try this during Happy Hour. From my co-worker I learned that the owner is the same that runs Maxx Speedshop - which is so good too, but that's another review.  Service was great, got seated right away----during lunch rush! Waiter was attentive and on point. Really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Wow!  Simply wow!  It was my first time here and a bacon cheeseburger was calling my name.  A \"Bacon cheeseburger on steroids\" to be specific.  My waitress hears my order and that it was my first visit and turns to a fellow waiter who says \"add a fried egg, tots on the side and sub Texas toast for the bun.\"  I skipped the egg (not what I had a taste for), but took his advice.  A stellar burger... one of the top 10 in my life, kind of burger.  WOW!  --------  Well.. I had to come back and remove a star.  My wife and I went back tonight and had a less than stellar experience.  We ordered a chips and queso appetizer and the chips came out soggy and limp, dripping with oil.  We sent it back and skipped the appetizer.  My burger and tots was tasty, but my wife's burger was so salty that I wish that I hadn't tasted it (seriously... it crunched from all of the salt).  Her fries were limp and soggy like the chips, just an oily mess.  Despite the waiter's apology for the appetizer and the manager dropping by, the appetizer was still on the check when the bill came (they took it off without argument).  Maybe it's time to take a break from this place for a while.  ---------  EDIT:  We've been back 3-4 times since and the service is back to their normal standards.  The kitchen must have been having a rough night.  I'm putting star #5 back."}
{"text":"Great food! Very tight restaurant though! We came in with a larger party and that was a mistake. It took a while to seat and it was uncomfortable.  I would suggest a party of 5 or less. The food is really good though! I've done the take out more than dining in and that's been better. They have a good option for the low carb dieter with lettuce as the bun and it does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bad Ass burger and tater-tots. While the burger was slightly undercooked and the tater-tots were a little burnt, my meal was still very enjoyable. The flavor of the burger was excellent - I loved the idea of grounding up the bacon in the patty. All of the ingredients were fresh. I also enjoyed the decor and atmosphere. Overall, this is a very solid choice if you are looking for a decent gourmet burger."}
{"text":"tasty vegan black bean burger.... although it is DEEP FRIED. sweet potato fries were on point. I rounded it out with a side salad.  resisted the sweet tea.    pretty good for airport food. and at $20 it was a bargain."}
{"text":"I had the Pittsburgher burger with tater tots and the fried pickles as an appetizer. Not a fan of the long cut fried pickles, I prefer the chips. The ones at the bottom got soggy. The burger was excellent and the tots were tots. The neighborhood and location are great."}
{"text":"For airport food, you can't go wrong. We were sat quickly. Staff was pleasant. Good diversity of menu items. The restaurant was busy but we didn't feel rushed (on a 3 hours lay over!). Sweet potato fries and sliders were about what you'd expect. Other burger options and shakes looked good, too, if I'm ever passing through again."}
{"text":"So this was my first time going to any Bad Daddy's Bar & it's very busy for a reason. The wait was about 25 minutes for 2 people. It's very loud, so be prepared. I got the All American burger cooked medium with hand cut fries. It was very yummy. For someone that normally goes to Red Robin, this was much better ...lol My husband got the Bacon cheese burger on steroids with sweet potato fries.  I will say, definitely ask for the chipotle ranch dip for fries, so so good.  While there I noticed a ladies drink across from me so I asked the waitress what she was having, turned out it was actually a margarita {which I normally don't drink alcohol but I know I don't like margaritas} so she suggested Daddy's Dragon Berry... I will definitely be getting that again this coming weekend for date night... Very good choice lol All in all the service & food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Solid burger, addictive \"onion straws\" (especially the sauce)... good overall, great for airport fare."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of Bruce K. (reigning Duke of CLT Airport).  I suggested this place when I was in town and I was glad he did!  For an airport this is a pretty good burger bar!  The meat was pre formed, but still tasted fresh and was cooked to order.  The bun was very soft and griddled to give it a little texture. I liked the amount of toppings - not too much, but just enough to add some contrast.   The standout was the side of tater tots, they were some of the best I have ever had!   They were addictively crispy and crunchy... finished them before even starting my burger. I dipped them in the Bad Daddy sauce and was in love!   I should have gotten a bottle of the sauce to take home.   The menu includes salads, sandwiches and a bunch of other indulgent foods. I want to try the location outside of the airport as it has a bigger menu and I would like to experiment with the different topping combinations."}
{"text":"great place to get a good meal if you have the time and waiting for a connecting flight. I had Mamma's ricotta burger with a side of onion straws... very tasty! The place is crazy busy. However, the staff has this thing down and will get you in and out within a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best tater tots in Charlotte!  I get either the Emilio's Chicken Sandwich (without the jalapeno bacon) or a chopped salad.  Always an easy pick, everyone leaves happy."}
{"text":"Food is good, probably the best Bad Daddy's around. However, service is bad. Wait is bad. Table availability is bad ! We went there on a Friday night at 9pm and the wait was 30 minutes ! After we sat down, it took a while to get our order. We asked the waiter to make sure our fries were fresh as we had several occaisions in other Bad Daddys when the burger is warm and the fries are cold. She was very straight: I can't promise that, we are way too busy, I have no idea how they will come out. Wow! That tells me how they care about their customers. It is a shame, because this place has a reputation, it is always busy and it needs to have waiters that are looking after their customers and to keep the restaurant reputation. Clearly the one we had wasn't looking for that at all.  Take out orders are available but very, VERY chaotic. I did it once, but, not sure if I would do it again. There is not take out parking, so, at times you have to park all the way to Kohls to come grab your food. By the time you get to the car it is already cold."}
{"text":"They surely serve great burgers on this restaurant. The service is a hit or miss... there are days which you have fantastic service and there are days which the service is terrible. I had more luck with exceptional service during lunch time sitting at the bar. However, this restaurant is perfect for a spring/summer evening where you can sit outside and just enjoy the Birkdale life going on. Be sure to arrive early or be ready to wait as in the evening the wait times are insane and can be near 1 hour to sit down."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places! I took my uncle here when he was in town and he still talks about the burgers when I see him. Definitely a good spot to grab a burger."}
{"text":"I know this is a burger place but their Stella Greek chopped salad is amazing!!!!!!   The burgers are to die for ...Love the Sam I am   Long standing restaurant in Ballantyne and if you eat here you will see why"}
{"text":"Yelp is just such a help when searching for places to eat. Having come across this on yelp we decided to give it a try. The parking lot is waaaay tooooo small for the amount of people who dine here, but somehow we managed to secure a parking spot.  Once inside we found out that there was a wait, but she mentioned that there was availability at the bar. We immediately decided to sit at the bar and we were waited on right away. All of the burgers looked great and we both had no complaints over our food whatsoever. Very tasty and loved the fries as well.  I would go again in a heartbeat, and certainly hope they make their way to Raleigh some time soon."}
{"text":"What could we say - the menu is classic. We have tried most of everything on it. We love some of them; others are good too just not our top choice. But it could be yours. We hope the side order items or appetizers could fresh with some new ideas from time to time, adding some surprise to our visit ;) we love our burgers !!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place but was left very disappointed. I was impressed with the menu and the variety of options. I ordered the Western burger, cooked medium and at $11.50 for a burger i had VERY high expectations. After a VERY long wait for my burger, when it finally arrived it was so over cooked it was almost burnt around the edge. And the fries were extremely soggy! A very unappealing meal. You'd think a 'burger' place would have perfected how to cook a burger correctly, especially for that price.  Give me 5 Guys any day, for 1/2 the price!"}
{"text":"So you're in the airport therefor you have limited meal choices.  Well Bad Daddy's is A-OK for sure.  I'm not a huge fan of anything on their menu but I know they will try hard to have decent beer and their salads are always plentiful.    The downside here is the place tends to stay packed so service can be a bit spotty so keep that in mind if you are looking for a quick bite.  You may want to head elsewhere.  Service is super friendly, just busy."}
{"text":"Ok, so yeah good burgers but even better salads in my opinion.  I like this place and am overall a very willing participant to go here but there are a few things that I've noticed that detract from my overall what would probably be a 4 star rating.  The interiors are fine, nothing crazy but here's my biggest issue inside...the bar height.  Or maybe it's the stools.  Either way, sit at the bar and you'll know what I mean.  The stools are too short and you feel like the counter is more than nipple high!  Weird and makes for awkward posturing during your meal.  My second issue is outside.....one word....parking.  There basically is none.  Going during lunch is like a quest similar to the game Zelda.  Most times you'll find yourself parking down the street a good bit and walking back.  Not a HUGE deal and seriously it's sort of an indicator that they must be doing something right because people don't seem to mind and keep the place pretty packed as far as I can tell.  I love the Asian Chicken Salad and of course the burgers (pretty much any) are fantastic.  Bottom line, don't let the parking issue get in the way and give Bad Daddy's (previously Big Daddy's) a shot!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places in Charlotte and not just for the burgers.  Their salads are delicious and today I tried the black bean burger and was blown away at how good it was.  They also do a great breakfast I hear but I haven't had the opportunity to try that out yet (but plan to soon!)  They provide daily bar specials and on Wednesday nights it's Mug Night and will fill up to 40oz at a time for your favorite draft beer between $2-$4!  Nice!  It's always crowded here but I've never had an issue with service so apparently the staff knows how to run a kitchen and hire good help.  Personal favorite appetizer = fried pickles Personal favorite side = sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at Bad Daddy's. This is my second time at this location. Each time I have had a 20 to 30 min wait time. (No complaint just a heads up for those who don't like to wait)The parched Dragon cocktail was great with the right mixture of sweetness and tartness. I did the create your own burger with sweet potato fries. Everything was hot and seemed fresh! I loved the sauce that came with the fries. Definitely a good quality burger. Would be 5 stars but the server was just ok not great. Also they did not offer/give us a child's menu although there was a child with us. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The burgers are average, with a good variety of toppings and styles . I love that they have tater tots as a side.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"I love the mushroom burger. Amazing with truffle fries. First time at the concord location. Absolutely love the food. But service at this location not so much .... we got a really bad table next to outside door and in the way of ppl leaving the restaurant. I ignored that, but than they changed our server and new girl didn't even bother to come and give us an updated as to how long the food will be. and once the food came after 30 mins (yes i timed it). she disappeared again, i had to get up look to see where she was? finally my husband spotted her and asked to the check. Other than that food was great definitely recommend, just speak up when you don't see your server."}
{"text":"With so many reviews out on this place, I'm not sure what more I could add.  Yes, they make some tasty burgers and yes, there is a big variety to choose from- including a few chicken and veggie options.  I just can't gush over Big Daddy's because, even given all of the above, this place lacks any kind of star quality.  A little context here- this place occasionally makes the lunch rotation with my co-workers and I.  We hit it up when the consensus of the crew is that we're all OK with a \"less than healthy\" option and we don't mind a crowd.  If you've been here for lunch, you know parking is a nightmare.  The 2 tiny parking lots adjacent to the actual building are far too small to accommodate.  Everyone ends up parking street-side, and I mean WAY down the street.  If I were real-estate shopping I'd avoid this street for the Big Daddy's parkers alone.  I know these are the constraints we work within inside this particular neighborhood, but I often choose against the place for the sole reason I don't want my car dinged by some poor parallel parker or side-swiped by some boat of an SUV.  My other concern is the general attitude of the wait staff I have encountered here.  If there were a stereotype of server here it would be this: 20-something college girl looking more for where the party is that night than whether I got the right order.  I hate to overly-generalize but I've just seen it too much here, and it has been consistent.  Yes, service is generally snappy, but a little too snappy, only to later find the waitress taking her time talking to the table of college guys at the other end of the restaurant.  It's perhaps just a general lack of professionalism here- which is a departure from the owner's typical MO for servers at his other restaurants.  That said, the food here is generally good.  As for sides, you can pick your poison- tater tots, onion, or potatoes- either sweet or regular, either as chips or fries.  In my opinion, the chips deserve a look- they are house-made.  The onions are heavily battered and a little too stringy for my taste.  I also find the sweet potatoes rather tasteless.    Never had the milkshakes, but they look good.  There's also a pretty big beer selection here.  Note that this place tends to get busy when the weather is nice- the covered outdoor patio is like a siren call to the traffic on East Blvd.    Overall, quality burgers with options a-plenty, just a general attitude and poor parking situation that makes me say, \"Meh.  Take it or leave it.\""}
{"text":"Oh man......so we hit up Bad Daddy's (my first time, even though I've passed this joint running to Freedom Park tons of times) on Saturday (St. Patrick's Day weekend) and I was simply amazed.  Maybe it was the fantastic weather or the fact that we had just spent an entire day at the Whitewater Center with friends drinking craft beers on a lime green river......but the burger I ordered (build-your-own which was medium-well, with jalapeno bacon, sauteed mushrooms, pepperjack cheese and the garlic mayo on the side.  It was delicious!  Service was fantastic, even if it was busy and I also ordered some blue margarita concoction and it was amazing!  AND last but not least the sweet potato fries are exquisite!!!!!  Definitely, one of my new favorite places in Dilworth!!!"}
{"text":"Serious problems in the kitchen. 30 minutes to get our food and then couldn't get all of the ingredients on the sandwich. Server was very nice but quality is miles better at Ballantyne location."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast.    Soggy bread.  No iced coffee.   Typical unfriendly airport staff.   Omelette was OK, nothing special.    Homefries / potatoes very bland."}
{"text":"First time to Bad Daddy's and very impressed. Good beer selection- they had a list of rotating (I'm guessing seasonal?) local beers on top as well as staples. Burgers were delicious and service was excellent. Patrick was friendly, fast and knowledgable of the menu- helping me make my decision among the many options the menu has to offer."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte. Awesome service. Great beer selection. They have buttermilk fried bacon, just sayin..."}
{"text":"Looking for a great burger? Or some SOUL FOOD. Head over to Bad Daddy's. This place is incredible. I really love their brand, the entire ambience can cater to any demographic, and it takes the southern style to their menu.  I have eaten here several times and I commend them on their high quality food and even better quality service. One of our servers was training in his first few days and one huge takeaway I had from the experience is that he stopped by the table without his trainer and chatted with us for a few moments, nothing serious mostly just small talk. But, things like this create culture in a restaurant and this is where a lot of places lack.   Now to the food, where the heck can I start. This place has got it. This particular occasion I got the Smokehouse burger. Let me warn you, don't get this thing if you have a small appetite. It comes out with some pretty dang good pulled pork, onion straws, and a burger with pepper jack cheese. I got a side salad with ranch, even this was incredible! This entire place has this niche market on lock, I can't wait to bring in new customers, and try your other locations!   PS- consider changing your name to amazing daddys"}
{"text":"I used to be a very good customer. Since well before the name change. But on one visit I saw something no one should see done in public by a bartender. I will spare you. But if I were a public health inspector they would be shut down. It was over 4 months ago and I am still repulsed. Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Their fried pickles are amazing and the milk shakes will satisfy anyone's sweet tooth.   I have been to Bad Daddy's a few times now and it won't be my last."}
{"text":"This wasn't bad at all for a last second got 15 minutes to eat dinner at 10:00pm before boarding a plane meal."}
{"text":"This is for the newer location in Birkdale Village. If your in the mood for a burger Bad Daddy's is a good spot. The atmosphere is loud so don't come for a 1st date! The food is brought out pretty fast. There are several burger options you can choose or just build your own where you choose the protein, type of bread and your toppings. either way you can't go wrong. I also like the grilled chicken sandwich built my own way with lettuce, tomato, raw onion and pickle with a side of sweet potato fries. If you like condiments be sure to ask ahead of time so you can be ready to eat when the food arrives. The wait on a Saturday evening 7:30 pm was 40 minutes. They offer beer and cocktails. I shared a milkshake that had alcohol it was strong and good!"}
{"text":"The best lil burger spot in clt I always customize my burger this place can get crowded but it's worth wait and hassle of very lil parking service is always good so is the food"}
{"text":"Ants & roaches! I have been a fan of Bad Daddy's (all locations) from the get go. Their food has never disappointed me. Especially the Cantina burger, it's my fave! But today's experience was cut short and has left me feeling pretty gross. The first table we sat at had ants all around! We literally killed at least 6 ants, before we even ordered our food. And we were inside by the way, not on the patio... So we requested to move to a different table. They apologized and offered us a free appetizer which was nice. But once I got halfway done with my salad, we saw roach on the wall!! At that point my appetite vanished immediately. We didn't tell them about the roach, just asked for a box, paid our bill and peeled outta there. It hurts me to say that I will not be returning to this location. :("}
{"text":"The fried pickles, Crispy Onion Straws, Crispy Buffalo Wings, Basic Burger, all are good. The Sam I Am Burger is awesome."}
{"text":"Burger (I got the one with Chili and slaw) was good - just a touch over cooked.  The chips with pimento cheese and the tater tots were very good.  The restaurant was very busy and the wait for the food was reasonable.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Bang! As soon as I read the USA Today Zagat article last week stating that Bad Daddy's was selected as one of the Top 25 burger joints in America I hit the place for lunch to see what all the fuss was about.  1. Service is very attentive but not overbearing... other places should learn from this chain.  2. While the place was packed the noise was tolerable...that can be an issue for many places.  3. After hearing that I was a Big Daddy virgin they gave me a free banana-pudding dessert... great stuff but I was already way full from a great lunch.  4. Last, BUT NOT LEAST, the burger, bun, condiments were very delicious. Being lazy I just ordered the day's special which included some beer cheese and other cool stuff... sloppy but way delicious. The sweet tater fries were just OK if not a tad limp... but the seasoning on them is tasty.  Oops... forgot... parking sucks at this location... plan on parking NEAR the restaurant not next to it..."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and have yet to find any place anywhere for that matter that has a better burger than Bad Daddy's do. If you're looking for a place with a healthy type burger let me say as loudly as I possibly can, that this is NOT the place. But if you're looking for a very delicious burger that is as messy as it gets, then you're gonna love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Gotta try the bacon burger on steroids :) They serve local craft beers on a rotating schedule."}
{"text":"My coworker took me here for lunch the other day, and it was my first time there. They have this new item called grill corn cheese sandwich and it was really declious. They gave you a very good portion of it. I couldn't finish of all. The tater tots are to died for. My coworker had the Western Burger. I would definetely be back for more tater tots. The service was great and fast."}
{"text":"At first glance, the sign stating that a hostess would seat us had us standing at the door for 6-8 mins until a bartender gave us the nod to sit at a dirty table covered in the previous diners' dishes.   Agreed with another reviewer that for people with bags there are far too many tables. It seems like a busy place with decent drinks/food but service is very lacking. No leadership is visible whatsoever.   Decided on some tater tots with chili after the menu didn't explode at me, and you can't screw up tater tots. Or chili. Very average fare.   Prices were high for drinks but that is to be expected at the airport. Not a bad experience but certainly not a good one. Overall won't be back on my next trip through Charlotte to give the gourmet burgers a chance."}
{"text":"One of the best turkey burgers in the charlotte area! Gotta love their tater tots and truffle fries... nom nom!  From my beef eating days, I can vouch that their burger is the burger I would eat if I ever decided I wanted a good burger!  Nice atmosphere, very casual. Great for lunch if you can handle the sleepiness afterwards, but even better for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Burgers were excellent. It looks like they had a decent beer selection as well. The vibe was not exactly kid-friendly, but they did have a kids menu. We went for lunch and there were hardly any customers, with lots of young female waitresses who were gossiping and lounging around, and weren't in a hurry to help us when needed to get the check, to go boxes, etc. I had to get up, holding a toddler, and get my own to go box and give them my card. No apology or anything for shoddy service the whole time. I get it if they are busy, but we were the only ones in there.   However, the burgers were really good, and as a place to go for a date or to grab a beer and burger at night, it seems like it would be a fun place."}
{"text":"Loved the fries and shakes ! friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch last Saturday and the place was packed.  I sat at the bar and ordered a beer, of which they have plenty to choose.  The bartender was friendly and called me by name, even though I'd never met her.  I ordered the Western Burger cooked Medium Well with Tater Tots.  Even though they were busy the food came out fairly quick.  The burger was juicy and had a lot of flavor and the Tater Tots were crisp.  They have plenty of TVs throughout the dining area with everything from College Basketball to Racing.    This is maybe the fourth time I've been and every experience has been good.  The service is always top notch and the food is on point.  THIS IS THE BEST BURGER PLACE IN CHARLOTTE."}
{"text":"I got seated straight away. The waitress brought me a glass of wine, a soda and water in seconds flat. My burger came out is a reasonable amount of time and was cooked as requested. My empty soda glass was refilled as soon as it hit the table. Decent prices for an airport!"}
{"text":"This place is hugely popular!  If you're impressed with bar food and long lines and being around lots of loud, obese people, this place is great.  It captures the Charlotte restaurant scene to perfection!  They have a banh mi burger, which is an Americanized version of a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich.  It's really bland, but at least the restaurant is stretching a little.  Sweet potato fries were good.  If you're bored with Chili's, you should definitely come here for a half-step up."}
{"text":"Great burgers and shakes.  Really enjoyed the special - PB and J burger.  Sounds crazy but tastes great.  Oh and the jalapeño bacon is legit!"}
{"text":"Breakfast potatoes were cold.   No one checked on me.  Been to b daddies in ballentyne.  Not what I expected."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of burgers - This may be the best burger place in the US.  Stella on tap, awesome appetizers and the \"Bad Ass Burger\" well it lives up to its name.  Try to stop by here at least once a week.  Great food, better service!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal burger! Last time I had the Pittsburger with added bacon which was outstanding...but had the frenchie and arguably the best burger in town! Have a decent beer selection and great service."}
{"text":"Love their Emilios burger! Chicken is cooked to perfection . I order sweet potato fries and they hit the spot! I love this spot, close to home, quick and delicious! What more can you ask for. Bf usually has the Cantina and that's pretty decent."}
{"text":"Great, fast and friendly service! The burgers are delicious. There is a very good beer selection."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group and we all proclaimed Bad Daddy's a success. First of all the sweet potato fries are delicious! Next, I have never been to a restaurant that allows you to custom create your side salad that comes with your meal, what a deal and quite delicious! Third. the burger... MY GOODNESS!!!! I had the Mama's Ricotta Burger and it was fantastic. I was a little confused by the name, because it has mozzarella cheese not ricotta cheese, but it did not disappoint. The mozzarella went perfectly with the pesto and the burger was made exactly to order (medium). Some friends tried the Frenchie and they raved about it, so I am sure that is good too. We loved our waitress, a nice combo of friendly, accommodating of large groups, but also not too pushy or overbearing. All in all I say Bad Daddy's is a success. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Yay, I'm a fan - BUT. OK, well first of all I love classic rock and that's what they play - but at 4PM on a Saturday afternoon it's blasting like \"one last song for closing\" at a NYC nightclub closing at 3AM? Why so loud? You can't hear your lunch (or early dinner) companion. The music is so overwhelming it takes away from the enjoyment of their delicious food.   Then there is the patio to escape to on a lovely day - except these post grads take over and yell at the top of their lungs, it's all about them, them, them. What happened to common courtesy. This happened last weekend at 3:30PM or so, and everyone there dining outside to enjoy the weather and escape the blasting music inside was looking at each other disdainfully. Just a sign or two, something on the menu asking folks to please be mindful of their fellow diners - it's a restaurant not a club.  Staff is quick, know their stuff - no doubt they'd like to say something, but these folks rely on tips for their income, and they don't want to jeopardize that, nor can they afford to. Bad Daddy's doesn't need rowdy students/post grads to bring in the business. Their quality speaks for itself. And I'm guessing the servers rake in a helluva lot better tips from the more mature couples (unless they get P.O.'d from the inconsideration \"hell raisers\". \"Nuff said?\""}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burger here. Really well run place.  The food is great, staff well trained and professional."}
{"text":"Today, Bad Daddy's was just OK.  Nothing special and I left feeling like the experience was a bit lacking.  I went with the family which includes 2 young kids.  To start off, I love the location and the decor is well done.  Nice ambiance and not too crowded for a late Sunday lunch. To start off with, my 4 year old wanted Mac and Cheese as a side.  They only have Mac and Cheese on Mondays.  Why in the heck would you only have mac and cheese one day a week, and on a Monday at that?  Weird.  Next, they had a special burger which didn't sound too appealing to me but it came with beer battered onion rings.  I asked if I could get an order of those, and was denied because they didn't have enough.  Again, weird.  I would have ordered the more commonplace (apparently) onion straws but I had them before and didn't care for them that much. I wound up getting fries which were overcooked, tasteless, and obviously the scraps leftover from the lunch rush.  At least, if you're a \"gourmet\" burger place, offer decent fries.  The tater tots that my daughter got with her hot dog were very good though and I ate off her plate. On to the burger.  I feel it is a restaurants responsibility, if I order a burger, no matter what I put on it to provide me with a non messy or soggy, burger that is well put together and provides a taste of all the topping in each bite.  This burger fell short of this expectation.  I ordered it Med Rare, and it was so greasy / soggy that the bun was saturated and the burger had to be eaten with a fork and knife (man point deduction).  So, the bun was not strong enough, and the burger was too \"wet\".  They also didn't distribute the toppings evenly and as a result they were all over the place.  I think if more care was given to the preparation it would have turned everything around.  Just slopping a burger and toppings on a bun when I'm paying the $$ I paid for this lunch isn't going to generate repeat business. I like the concept of Bad Daddy's, I really do.  I may go back again, but to be honest there are plenty of places to get a burger and this past experience was lacking."}
{"text":"Ordered the buffalo wings and fries. Both were great and got some kind of magical sauce. The sauce was such an unexpected pleasure. I will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday after some holiday shopping with a girlfriend & we decided to for-go the burgers and split some apps instead. Nachos and fried pickles were the lucky chosen ones and we chose well!  The nachos were huge! This is not your mama's nachos - heaping scoops of sour cream and guacamole, ground beef chili, black beans, onions, queso sauce and tomatoes all added up to me being very, very happy. I did have to add alot of Texas Pete since there weren't any jalapenos, so next time I'm going to ask for them!  The fried pickles were good but not great - they're strips not chips, and they were just a little too thin for our tastes. As my girlfriend said, \"I need more pickle\" but the batter was one of the best we've tried!  I got a specialty drink off the menu - some Blue Devil concoction and it tasted like a gobstopper. Needless to say, it was awesome and a full glass worth of fun for $8!  We agreed we're going back soon for the burgers (the Frenchie looks awesome!) and fries to see if they live up to the hype!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Huntersville!  I don't have anything negative to say....they have great food and great service.  My kids like it too. Love the outdoor seating!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have never had a bad burger here!!! Pair it with a Catawba River White Zombie and you'll see!!!!"}
{"text":"Truly one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  The menu has so many options that there is something for everyone for likes burgers.  I highly recommend the fried pickles as an appetizer.  The only drawback is that the place is small and gets pretty crowded."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty darn tasty, the tots are good, and the beer ain't bad. The one thing about the East Blvd place is the parking. NIGHTMARE! Be sure to park in the second section. The first section is BARELY roomy enough for compact cars, and when people don't pull all the way in to their space (like happened to a friend), she BARELY got out. Otherwise, this place is great. Service is quite nice and -- again -- the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Located in the Charlotte airport. I was flying home from Gainesville and had a 3 hour layover. I was looking first something decent to eat for breakfast. The menu had a good variety of burgers, breakfast items and snacks. I had a spinach and feta omelette that was really good. Generous with the spinach, feta and the home fries. My server was great considering she was working most of the room herself. I never wanted for anything. An added bonus was I could sit and people watch from my seat. I have since been back three times. Love the breakfast."}
{"text":"I love me a good burger joint where there is a roll of paper towels at your table ready to clean those hands from the lovely juices that flow from a juicy burger.   Bad Daddy's is located in Terminal C of the Charlotte Airport. It's a small spot, but they tightly fit about 50 or so people at a table, raised table, booth or bar. During sports its difficult to find a seat since most tend to hang out and continue drinking beers after completing their dinner.  I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids which had Monterey Jack cheese (which I left off because I can't eat cheese), three pieces of jalapeño bacon, three pieces of applewood smoked bacon, housemade bacon mayo (actual bacon pieces in it), shredded iceberg lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles. I requested a medium cook, to which the chef nailed, and it came nicely wrapped in a burger diaper with a side of sweet potato fries. The jalapeño bacon had a nice kick to it, but trust me with 6 slices of bacon it was piled high and delicious. I like my bacon crunchy and they achieved that with each bite. I washed it all down with a pint of beer and left there a very happy person.  If you are a burger lovey, you would love this place as those around me really enjoyed their burgers and some even had the buffalo wings. I did not, but heard they were good."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in recent memory. I chose the \"Sam I Am\" (American cheese, rosemary ham, over-easy egg, tomato, and pesto on a 7-oz. patty cooked to order to a perfect medium), but every plate of food I saw going by looked equally drool-worthy.   Good selection of beers, too. Plus, there was this insane chipotle-BBQ-mayo dipping sauce for my tots that I almost wanted to lick out of the little cup.   So scratch that \"recent memory\" business. This was the best burger and tots I've ever eaten.   Three more days on this 4-day business trip, and I'm seriously contemplating a return engagement to try another creation...that is, if my arteries can handle it."}
{"text":"The host was rude, she was too busy on her phone to even pay attention to customers coming in. We ordered an appetizer and drinks and the drinks took 20+ minutes to get to our table even though we were right across the bar. I ordered the bad ass margarita, which tasted awful. The appetizer took 40 mins to come out, it was only chips and dip which I figured was pretty simple. Waited another 30 mins on our food and had ordered one more drink before we received our food which came out after everyone was done eating. My burger was soggy. The only good experience that I have had here was when the manager was waiting the tables and running things that day I came in."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I mean great. I've been here several times and am always pleased no matter what food I order. They have a great variety of food and sides, outdoor/indoor seating, and a great staff. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger on steroids last time and boy, when they say bacon they mean bacon. Good for all groups and they also have a bar and lots of tvs. Amount of food you get for the price is perfect."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars instead of 3 solely based on the sauce that comes on the side....some type of aioli i image? It's good, dipped my fries in the more than using my ketchup. I got the western burger and my mom got the bacon cheeseburger on steroids. Mine was good, she said hers was \"alright\" but she says that about everything that is good, unless It's absolutely delicious. So....it must have been good. I also got a double shot of crown on the rocks which was $15, better deal than what I was originally going to order - Sauvignon Blanc at $14.50/glass... I'll stop here again if I'm near this area, but won't go out of my way...."}
{"text":"Pet-friendly establishment.  I was gonna sit outside until I saw a (beautiful, well-behaved) pit-mastiff sitting with its owner... so I went back in.  The food was underwhelming to say the least.  I got the fried blackbean burger and house chips.  Chips on top were soggy and seasonless.  All the crispy seasoned chips were at the bottom of the bowl.  My burger was lukewarm and bland.  MorningStar makes a spicy blackbean burger thats way better than this!  Blackberry moonshine drink was weak af!  No berries.  Think its just berry flavored w fizz.  ??? Waitress checked on me alot, so she got tipped 30%."}
{"text":"I can't really say if it is good or not since my food arrived with nuts after mentioning my nut allergy to the waitress and I ended up sick  hubby enjoyed his bison burger hence the 3 stars.   The management was apologetic and replaced my meal with nachos which were just ok - I hate when they pile up the nachos to the point where only the top few are covered in toppings and those underneath are just well there lol.  I will say this the free banana pudding was bites of Uber goodness just as the manager promised.   I'll give it another shot and go with a safe order if a burger the next time."}
{"text":"Their burgers are good. I also had a greek salad and it was good, but I wish they had served it in a bowl instead of on a plate. I only gave them 4/5 stars because out of 3 bathroom stalls, only 1 was clean enough to use. We ate at a slow time so someone should have been checking the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Delish!!! If you want a burger fix, this is the place!!! I ordered the Bad Ass Burger since it was hi lighted on the menus, and certainly you can't go wrong with a name like that! Even though I ordered the smaller burger I couldn't make it half way through! But every bite was good. The sweet potato fries were perfect! Cooked fresh, crisp on the outside, sweet and tender on the outside! Topped of with fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade, sweet and tart at the same time! Yummmmy!!!  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER EVER- for some reason our server( some blonde girl) completely rushed us into leaving while she had other tables still there. The food was not terrible but not the best first time experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location. I know that it's smaller because it's located in the airport but it really made me miss my Raleigh locations.   Firstly - the service was decent but the waiter did not offer enough attention to our refills. She was very slow especially to be working at the airport.   The Food- I ordered a burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare. They  botched my order by cooking the burger well done and so well done   the edges of the burger were crispy.  Overall this location simply let me down. I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"OMG! The burgers are as big as your head! The bacon cheeseburger on steroids was enormous and delicious! Very juicy! We went on a Friday afternoon and were seated quickly. Everyone from the hostess to our server were great! My boys enjoyed their burgers and were ready for a nap afterwards. I deducted one star because the bathroom wasn't very clean and there were no paper towels to dry my hands. The place was also very loud even though it wasn't packed. Maybe something to do with the shape of the room or ceiling height? Other than that, I liked it and will return."}
{"text":"Fun fact: I do NOT eat burgers! Why am I at a burger place, you might ask. Well, my bf does eat them and he had heard great things about bad daddy's.  I created my own grilled chicken sammie with brioche bread, cheese and bacon. It came with a side of fries and bad daddy sauce. The sauce was sooo good and this was THE BEST grilled chicken sammie I have had in a while! Who would think I would find it in a burger place?! My bf said his burger was also really good.  But yeah, for all you non burger eaters, try the chicken sammie. It was amazing! My only complain is the service sucks, like really sucks! We waited 40min and there were tables open. We asked if we could sit outside but they said they had the patio closed, which is surprising bc the weather has been great. The hostess was nice but just seemed inexperienced. The staff at this location needs some training and a manger should be on the floor until you can get your staff up to speed. We saw so many people who got fed up of waiting and just left, money out the door.  If this place can get their service to match their food, it will be a definite home run!"}
{"text":"This place was a true burger joint.  Huge burgers.  The sweet potato fries are a great highlight.  Great location, friendly staff, great brews, and just up the street from a fabulous park for a stroll with your Lady.  Parking is a bit tight, but great food, brew, and superb staff.  Who worries about parking with a full belly and spirits, right. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Two words: Bookmark it! Take it from a bad-@$$-foodie who lives on dine-ins, takeouts. Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is one of the best restaurants that you'll find at any airport. This one is located at Charlotte Airport \"CLT,\" concourse C to be exact.   While waiting for my flight back to Philly, I grabbed an outstanding All American burger, with a side of tater tots. An American style Wagyu Kobe burger ($4 upcharge) with ketchup, yellow mustard, shredded lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles. The melted cheddar ($1.09) was delicious compliment to the burger while a fried egg ($1.49) dressed the top.   What could be better than this burger?  Four and half Yelps"}
{"text":"Love love love this place Best burgers in town  Every time we visit the service is great and we love to beat outside when the weather permits"}
{"text":"Great burgers, love to make my own salad. I always do the create your own small salad as a meal and it's plenty. Kids like the sliders and fried pickles. The kids love their milkshakes and I have to admit they are really good. Burgers always are cooked right and flavorful.  All of the ingredients are fresh...this is one of our go to places.  It also has a full bar and drinks that have some bang!"}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for a juicy burger i head to Bad Daddy's burger in Dilworth. Excellent burgers, great fries, and good service. Everyone makes me feel like a regular there even though I only go there once in a while. The cheeseburger on steroids is a success and they usually have great beer specials going on as well. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"So after a gruling night of Trivia at the Lesbian bar Hartigans.........Arin and I were on the winning team mind you *grin*....we decided we need a little food before heading home.  So after my last experience at BDBB and some offline chats with the owner I decided to give them another chance......and this place rocks the tater tots, so.............off we went.  Being a Wednesday night around 10pm it was slow and we sat at the bar.....again.  We ordered our drinks and a little side of the TTs.  Next to us was a gentleman that had a plastic tupperware (or what looked like it) jug half full with beer..............hmmm....so we inquired and realized Wednesday was mug night....bring in any mug and get it filled for $4!!!!!!!!!!!!  Wow........working with numbers and realizing how big of a mug you could bring in...............Now this place understands what a recession is all about...............a good deal!  The food arrived and everything was tasty.  No issues this time.................but....and you knew there had to be a but...........the waiter stand that is where I saw the horror last time is right beside the mens bathroom, so when I went in I literally had to raise my right arm to misse the mutliple pitchers of Tea and water that were stacked on that surface...........I know the space is small....and I'm not trying to bust anyone's b*lls, but personally I'd move that station somewhere else if possible, though it may not be due to the current configuration.  So 3 stars are good for now...I'll come back again soon and if they continue to deliver, I'll continue to up the stars.....heck I'd do it just for the tater tots!  *wink*."}
{"text":"This by far is one the best burgers i have ever had. The patty's are think and the \"Bad Daddy\" sauce is amazing to say the least. I got the bacon cheeseburger on steroids. That is a burger that you get once a month, but this is the best place to get a burger hands down.   I have never had bad service here."}
{"text":"Consistent, big, juicy burger and lots of topping choices included in base price.  LOVE the burger in a bowl option - wish they had that available at the airport location. Good service (maybe a tad \"over\" attentive), great location.  Pretty noisy, but to be expected, it's a family eating establishment."}
{"text":"Good food, great by airport standards and reasonably priced. Fast, friendly service. Buffalo chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries - the sandwich was really good, next time I'll probably try the tater tots instead of the fries."}
{"text":"I'm sure most people are like myself and come here for the burgers. (I love the buffalo burger so much it is what I get everytime I dine at Big Daddy's.)  However,  My friend often gets a salad which looks great. They allow you to build your own with a great variety to choose from."}
{"text":"$15 for a chicken sandwich.  Server said their special chicken sandwich came with a side.  I asked if they had a vegetable.  He said they could do steamed broccoli.  My bill came with a $2 \"BYO Side broccoli\" Seems like it wasn't even an upcharge, he just straight up charged me for an additional side.  Had I known that I would have gotten fruit or one of their approved sides.  I cannot stand it when servers neglect to mention upcharges."}
{"text":"Thanks to having a wife to go out and eat with, we were able to order two different things and try half of each.  That was, without question, the best chicken sandwich I have ever eaten in my life, and probably a tie for the best burger.  Options is the name of the game at this place, and there are plenty.  A practically endless array of combinations of unique toppings to put on your burger (battered and fried bacon, anyone?).  My sandwich was fairly standard as far as the toppings went (bacon, poblano mayo, guacamole), but cooked to perfection.  My wife's burger, which she claims is the best she's ever had, was a beef burger (cooked medium, yay for grinding your own meat) with brie, bacon, and garlic mayo.  There were countless cheeses and toppings to choose from, and we finished the meal off with some exquisite banana pudding.    I'm told that tonight was an anomaly, and that normally we'd have seen a line out the door to be seated, so I guess we got lucky.  It's going to be tough not to come here on ever trip to the Queen City after this.  I'm thankful that we have a place in Asheville that can compare, otherwise I'd be depressed to leave tomorrow."}
{"text":"It goes without saying that this is by far one of the best lil burger places around!   The service is quick and the wait staff is friendly!  The burgers are great, ranging from a great black bean burger to pretty much any type of topping on a meat patty!  I recommend the sweet potato fries as a side, but... hey! Go crazy with the onion sticks if you will!!!!  Definitely give it a shot, parking is limited so if you go during prime time lunch, be prepared to walk a spell before getting into the restaurant."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in CLT for a layover I always make sure I head to Bad Daddy's for tots, beer and wings! Sometimes I go for a burger and they're pretty good too but nothing beats a cold NoDa Hop Drop N Roll and some tots while catching up on some sports news. Service can be hit or miss....but you know what, this is a busy restaurant in a fairly busy part of the airport. As a twice a week traveler I don't expect the restaurants in the airport to be five stars. But I will definitely take a four star one while I'm chilling in between flights!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place 5 stars.  The food was absolutely outstanding.  However, our service definitely needed a whole lot of work.  My partner and I wandered in here around 8:00 on a Sunday, which I suppose is not a prime time for burger eating, but I had tried to visit twice before when I was too impatient to fight for parking and wait.  Luckily, we had no wait and got right into the place.    We decided to skip appetizers because we figure we would have more food than we could possible ever want to eat.  I ordered the PB&J shake - OMG, this was probably one of the best shakes I have ever eaten.  I could almost swear they put crack in it, or some other equally-addicting drug.  My partner ordered the Bad Ass Burger, which has so much junk on it I won't list it here.  However, the big thing to note is that it had buttermilk-fried bacon on it, and lots of bacon stuffed in the burger itself.  I guess that saying that everything is better fried must be true, because that bacon was SOOOOOO awesome.  I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids, which I could swear had nearly a pound of bacon on it (half of which had tasty jalapeno bacon).  Both burgers were absolutely delicious, and their sides were pretty good as well (even though neither of us ate too much of them).  We finished our burgers, but my stomach hated me for it.  Despite the good food, our service was awful.  I am not a picky service person, and I don't expect the server to come by and attend to my every need.  However, we waited almost 45 minutes for our food, during which time our waitress pretty much ignored us entirely.  We saw her once after our food got delivered, but she did not stop by again.  We waited almost 20 minutes after we finished eating before we finally went up to the counter to ask for our check.  I looked around to see if she had left, but she was in the back working on prep work.  Really, she couldn't come out and at least bring us our check?  Very, very aggravating.  I have no doubt that I will try it again at a different time on a different night.  Truly, their food is really tasty, reasonably priced, and quite plentiful.  Hopefully the bad service was just a one-off."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.  We went in 45 minutes before boarding started.  We waited until we couldn't wait anymore.  I was told our food was coming, it never did.  I tried to tell our server out of courtesy we were leaving couldn't wait any longer.  No apology, just a simple OK seems to be standard operating procedure.  Eat somewhere else, anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is my third trip to the the Dilworth location. Service has always been superb. Hostess Staff is polite. I've never had the same burger twice, and everything has been cooked as ordered. I would recommend the tater tots over the fries. Fries tend to be soggy. And the banana pudding is a must for dessert. And buttermilk fried bacon? Add it. Trust me."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for an Airport rest stop.  Properly cooked, hot, not just warm, and juicy burger, with crisp lettuce and a fresh bun on top. The fries, well they could be better, but this burger is not bad, not bad at all.  Solid B, for Burger,"}
{"text":"Poor customer service! I typically recommend this place to all my friends when they are traveling through CLT, but I will not be doing that anymore. I rushed to stop by to grab a bite to eat before my next flight but when I arrived no one would acknowledge my presence. Finally when someone did at 7:53pm i was told by one of the wait staff that they were closed. Funny, I was able to walk from Concourse C to E in time to sit down and order at Fox Sports before 8pm when they closed. Needless to say, I will not return or recommend anymore."}
{"text":"Can you give negative stars?   Ok... I can't comment on the food.... But that's only because I never got to taste it... Sat for 45 minutes and only got to try how flat their club soda was.   Hostess sat me quickly... A little cramped, but it's the airport.   5 minutes to be greeted... Enough time to have my entire order ready- apparently I threw the kitchen through a loop because I ordered soup and a burger, but asked for the soup to come out first. I'm weird, I know.   7 more minutes for pseudo club soda, that came with the check.   10 More minutes... She disappeared to apparently make the soup from scratch.  I asked another server to check on the food.   7 more minutes till my server popped back up.  Asked her about the soup.   10 more minutes passed.... I cancelled everything... Because my flight was boarding.  Needless to say... If you want to spend 40 minutes or so with one drink, this is the place for you!   Ps- the last 5 minutes I spent asking the server what the hell happened"}
{"text":"A group of us went here after a convention on a Sunday night. We experienced a very short wait and great customer service. This was possibly the best burger I've ever had!!! They got my order wrong but were quick to replace my meal and make it right. This is a huge burger, so pack an appetite when you go here. It is a very casual establishment and family friendly, so don't be afraid to take the entire family. All of us that went are looking forward to getting back soon!!! The parking was a bit tricky, but definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"We have been there four times three at ballentyne once in dillworth. Twice during peak lunch and it was painfully slow. Food is pretty good I have had the badass and it lives up to the name. Today I made my own and it was good but very sloppy. My toppings were half on the burger half on the plate. So all in all it's a pretty good place but don't ever be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Love the idea of building your own salad when your not in the mood for burger or you just want to be healthy. But the diced chicken option for the salad was dried out and tasteless.  Another draw back on the restaurant was it was way too loud!! All the hard surfaces and the open ceiling cause this problem."}
{"text":"Always solid food, decent service. We always go during some sort of rush - big game, happy hour, etc. So, the service is always slow, very slow, but it's just the time we go. Burgers are unique, very good. Tater tots - I'll go there just for their tot sauce. Nice people."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for lunch on our way to a friend's wedding. Oh. My. God. The burgers were so drool worthy just reading them on the menu, that we were taking pictures of them and sending them to our other halfs. I ordered Emilio's Chicken Sandwich (based on a few other Yelper's reviews) and she ordered the Chicken Club. Everything, down to the sauces they paired with our sweet potato fries and onion straws, was out of this world. We had amazing service and almost no wait.   Our only disappointment was that we wouldn't be bringing our men back to try it since we were heading out of town first thing the next morning! There's been talk of a trip back just for Bad Daddy's Burger Bar!"}
{"text":"I desperately wanted to try the buttermilk battered deep fried bacon but alas I'm a wimp.   I was shocked to see the menu didn't provide sourcing information on the beef or at least where it comes from but then the management had a wait staff training then testing immediately next to our table where they questioned the wait staff about this and there was a written test. Color me baffled because no one talks about this and no one waiting on me referenced any of this info so why test these kids on it? My soror said, it's in case people ask - which was her guess and a way to make fun of my Madisonian ways because in MADTOWN the menu provides this info.   Anywhoo...as for the quality of the meat. Nothing to write home about. It wasn't flavorfully impressive. It was cooked to the right temperature without drying the meat so that was great.   The batter on her fried pickles made me wish I really go the bacon and made me think they'd season everything else since it was nice. The tator tots are not my fav but they had some season. The dipping sauce is mayo based so I can't touch it. All in all, there was a wait as we came at 7:30pm after my interview I wanted beef as in a burger and she took us here. She had the big burger with the buttermilk bacon before and said it was salty so I didn't try it. I had the pulled pork special of the day burger.   The pork was nice on its own. Served with Mont. Jack. added jalapeño bacon and it wasn't spicy at all so don't be scared of it. Got the spiked margarita lemonade offer and pass it along - maybe cuz I'm not a drinker but I appreciate daily specials. They offer meat changes (turkey, tofu, chicken, idk); veggie options to swap and pesto on the menu along with several cheeses but got rid of the three cheese infusion.   Server was sweet. The patio didn't have heat lamps as previously held so we waited inside and the place barely has room to wait for anything other than a menu and a walk out."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the delicious vegetarian burger option. I know Bad Daddy is a chain restaurant in the South and I am glad it had a branch at the airport. I was not expecting tasty food at the airport but this place hit the spot. Wish there was a Bad Daddy in NYC. I strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Took the family last night and there was a 20 min wait.  Waiter gave us the specials for the night and provided good service.  The portions are very large so go hungry. The onion straws were tasty and so are the sweet potato fries.  Extensive list of beers.  Prices are reasonable.  It is consistently voted one of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is easily my favorite place for a HUGE burger. There's two types of burgers in the world. 1. Fast Food burgers - and that for me, IN-N-OUT IS KING! (California born and raised!) and then 2. There's the huge restaurant style burgers that you never finish, but have delicious left overs later.  This place takes the cake. You can build your own, so I usually do horseradish mayo, fried egg, bacon, jalapeños, cheese, onions and pickles!! Let me tell you.... you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Emphasize the BAD in Bad Daddy Burger! We were catching a connecting flight in Charlotte figured a burger break would fit in our layover plan. After waiting 15 minutes at our seats, being told twice someone would be right over we bailed. Don't know if the foods any good, don't care now. Its an airport, people are not just hanging out enjoying the view, we're all on tight schedules. Seat people, give them menus then food then checks an easy formula. The place was busy but not full, most people were finishing their meals. Wasted my layover, grabbed some packaged food from the grab-n-go place. Won't be fooled again! Bye BAD Daddy Can't give zero stars, bummer"}
{"text":"We were wandering around Birkdale window shopping wasting time before our flight out of concord...I texted a friend for lunch ideas and she suggested several restaurants there. I was skeptical since Birkdale is a higher end shopping area and I was afraid the food wouldn't live up to the fancy descriptions or prices. This place did not disappoint! All of our food was AMAZING! I had the Handbreaded chicken sandwich which was suggested by the server since I couldn't decide between that and the bad daddy burger. It was so amazing, I can't wait to go back and eat that sandwich again! It's very casual but the food is over the top amazing. Great food, casual setting, come as you are...loved it!"}
{"text":"The service was fine and the atmosphere is cool but honestly, our food was underwhelming. I'm surprised it's so busy (don't think the lines are warrented based on my one visit). Parking can be a nightmare during busy times."}
{"text":"I had the bun-less burger wrapped in a lettuce wrap and it was delicious. Currently doing a clean diet and was worried they wouldn't have options but lots of salads to choose from & healthy eats. Hubby loved his  burger! He had the bad ass burger and fries. Sat at the bar and service was great. Will be back"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but hey its an airport.   Burger was ok and the sweet potatoe fries were good.  Better than fast food."}
{"text":"This is the place to go If you are looking for a great burger. Since they grind the meat you can order a medium rare hamburger. I also recommend the chicken sandwiches. I have never had a dried sandwich."}
{"text":"I recently had a layover at Charlotte airport and decided to try this place out. It's basically a casual sports bar. I wasn't sure what to expect as far as their food, and my expectations weren't too high, honestly. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. Seriously surprised! The burger was perfectly cooked and the bacon was perfect. I was definitely impressed with the burger, I have paid more and not gotten this good of a burger.  Even better than the burger, or at least as equally good, the tater tots. Wow! I love tater tots and these were some of the best I've had. They also have Arnold Palmers, a winner every time. The one complaint I have is that my girlfriend and I both got the wrong order the first time, fries instead of tots and ham - we asked for none. But the waitress was extremely helpful and pleasant. She took care of it right away and even took one of the burgers off the bill! I would definitely eat here again, just wish we had one close to my home."}
{"text":"Airport restaurant are supposed to be fast and efficient. This restaurant fails at that and on top of it, the food was not worth it either. You expect to pay more for food at the airport but paying $12 for truffle fries that are soggy and also waiting 30 minutes for the food is just not acceptable at an airport. The waiter took over 10 minutes to come over to take our order. A patron several tables down was waiting so long for his food he took fries off another table that has left. This place set a new standard for poor airport service."}
{"text":"Black bean burger=YUM. Sweet potato fries=Delish. You don't have to eat cow or foul to truly enjoy this burger joint!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I love Bad Daddy's and we usually dine at the one off of East Blvd.  We were spending our Saturday evening in Birkdale Village and decided to stop in.  Just like the other locations, you can dine inside or outside and although they were quite crowded, we were seated with no wait time.  We opted for the Backyard Chicken Nachos as an appetizer, which was quite delish and piled with shredded BBQ chicken, pineapple, Ale queso, corn slaw, cilantro, black beans, barbecue sauce, and topped off with a drizzle of ranch sour cream.  There's only one other place in which I think the BBQ Nachos are the best, but I think this Backyard Chicken Nachos just made it to the top of the list!!  Oh yeah, the fried pickles are MUST as well.  Enough about the nachos... Anytime we're in the mood for a great burger, this is our go-to spot!  Everything from simple to eclectic to build-your-own burgers (veggie, bison, turkey, and chicken are available as a meat/protein choice), you can find something that suits you.   Oh yeah, their salads are AMAZING!  I usually do a build your own salad and top it off with a protein in the form of a 7 oz. burger patty.  The treehugger salad is one of my faves as well.  I do often go for the Pittsburger (burger patty, spicy garlic ketchup, shoestring fries, lettuce, tomato) and my husband always orders the Bad A$$ burger, which is a massive burger topped with all of the trimmings as well as buttermilk fried bacon.  They have fries, tots, sweet potato fries, and now onion rings!   I either go for the fries or tots, but they've changed their fries to a smaller/thinner size, in which I don't care too much for, but I do order them with a side of Bad Daddy's sauce if I'm in the mood for regular fries.  They also have a variety of beers for beer lovers, a full-service bar, and also adult milkshakes (yummy).  Don't worry, you can bring the whole family as a have a kids menu too!"}
{"text":"Decent burger but Antonio at the window is a first class a-hat. The fact this guy hasn't been fired tells you management is asleep."}
{"text":"Not that expect too much from an airport location but this place really didn't excite, and we tried it 2 times... I am leaning more to a 2.5 stars. Service is ok, but if you sit there for a little bit and no one comes over they probably didn't notice that you sat down so just get up and grab someone.   For breakfast the toast comes out like flavorless French toast which was really odd. The Jalapeño bacon is good and cooked well though so get a couple orders of that...and eggs come out like ordered (we ordered over hard and medium and both were fine). Getting anything \"custom\" such as a large glass of OJ with no ice is apparently difficult, we said we would pay for 2 small ones, but that concept wasn't coming across to the server.   Drinks are 13.99 each....WHOA! I mean a mimosa...holy surprise!   No place to charge phone unless your ok giving your phone to the server (and they are willing). They have a bar open early so you can get food and drinks it seems mostly all day."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Big Daddy's--definitely one of my top two or three Burger joints in Charlotte. Before getting to the food, it's worth mentioning that BD's is a great place to come for a beer. Lots of selection, lots on tap, and for great prices. They even had a deal a while back in which you could fill any glass (bring your own) for like $5, which was amazing. Sadly, I think they did away with that. Great outdoor seating lets you drink (or eat, or both) outside, and there's always a lively scene out there and indoors, especially on Thursdays and the weekends. I actually saw a whole lot of people there for brunch on saturday when I was driving by--never been that early but apparently it's good.   As for the food, it's awesome. Tons of different and original burgers, each prepared perfectly. My favorite is the western, which comes with sauteed onions, bbq sauce (amazing) and cheddar cheese. My girlfriend got a chicken thing with guacamole and hot sauce, and it was delicious. The fries and the other sides--pasta salad, slaw--were really good compliments too.   Definitely go back as much as I can. Pretty cheap and definitely an easy, quick experience if you need it to be. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I wish I could give Bad Daddy's a higher score, but the service was poor. My family and I visited over winter breaks and we were one of two tables outside (alright, we are northerners) and it took 25 minutes to just get water, which is difficult when so many patrons are visiting before catching a movie at the theater.  The food however, exceeded my expectations, and the draft list is quite extensive. I got a salad (to make up for the Sweetwater 420s), which was definitely the best salad I've ever gotten at a burger joint.  Point blank: go for the great food and beer, but go after the show, not before."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a layover in Charlotte and it made all my dreams come true. I got the Brie cheese, apple, bacon turkey burger and it was angelic. On the side I got the sweet potato fries which were just as good. Especially for a meal in between flights this place hits the SPOT."}
{"text":"Excellent. I was very hungry from travel and this food hit the spot. Fresh, fast and delicious. Amelia was a delightful server who cared for me and is obviously proud of her work and the product.  I had the Patty melt on rye with caramelized onions. The meat was cooked to perfect doneness, the fries crispy outside and tender inside - not soggy! And with a delicious dipping sauce. I asked for jalapenos on the side and got a generous serving.  And when Amelia brought me my check she offered me a take-away soda! Thanks Amelia. Thank you Bad Daddy's."}
{"text":"awesome place, on my top 3 in Charlotte. great burgers, love the fries and sauce. Good beer good seating indoor and out. Very much recomend this place."}
{"text":"Don't sit at the bar.  The primadonna bar tenders act like they are doing you a favor when they finally serve you.    I don't think service etiquette has changed since I waited tables in college but aren't you supposed to serve the main course after the customer is finished with the appetizer?  Or at least ask if you want them together or one at a time?  Not at this place.  They just dumped them both on me at once.   The nachos are terrible the burger was good."}
{"text":"Left my Mexican paradise  On a big vehicle that flies. Back to Tucson and my personal fort But first a stop in Charlotte's airport. Had a burger earlier from the Cozumel airport food crew So all I really wanted was a cold and tasty brew. Found Bad Daddy's and enjoyed a Blue Moon Maybe I had two on this rainy day in June. What a great way to spend a layover, drinking and watching the World Cup. If ever back this way I'll stop in again to say, Hey Bad Daddy, What's up?"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the first time last night. She had one of the \"build your own\" burgers which she said was really good. I had their \"Bad Ass Burger\" which was amazing! I mean seriously...who has battered and deep fried bacon? We will definitely  be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is hopping in the CLT and I'm about to tell you why! Since opening at the end of 2011 at the airport, flyers can bet in having a quality burger or salad before a long journey.  I enjoyed a greek salad option instead of a burger this time.  My friend got a turkey burger. Both were very good. I might say that the salad was the best I've had at an airport venue anywhere!!  I just cannot give 5 stars when the host forgets us and also forgets to give us eating utinsels for a long while. It was after 8pm and indeed the venue was packed but this should not mean that we go unnoticed for more than 20 minutes.  After all we were pretty noticable without being at the Burger Bar!  Really. Trust me. Believe me."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is great, and the burgers are to die for!!  Love the buttermilk fried bacon!"}
{"text":"i really love this place the burger are soo good. I normally get the chicken emillo that come wth gucamole .the waitress are super nice and  most meals are under 10 bucks. I just wish they give a little more fries but still love the place."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger ... One of the best I've had .... In an airport no less!"}
{"text":"we went to this location because my parents in law live in the ballantyne neighborhood and they arent adventurous enough to try the penguin or something like that (my mother in law is very picky) while we were visiting.. and while i am always up for an eating adventure if the food is good.. we tried here instead... i wasnt disappointed by the food tho i did try the baconaitor? ultra bacon burger... bacon cheeseburger with two kinds of bacon and baconaise  it was very good bacon cheesburger but dam...11.50 for a burger... i wouldnt get it everyday"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries and great service.  Fun, electric atmosphere inside.  If it's a hot day, DO NOT sit outside.  They have a dark awning with no ceiling fans to move the air.  You will bake outside, so wait for the table inside."}
{"text":"Everything was great, especially the service! I ordered the Pittsburgh burger and it delivered. The cook even came out and asked me how it was! Matt, the bartender is well-knowledgeable, and suggest sitting at the bar, if possible. Glad I stopped-in, and am looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"This is one of the most crowded restaurants every time I come. And it's clear well deserved. Although the service can be somewhat slow, everyone is extremely helpful and the food here is always good. Great place to come for a meal, grab a beer, and relax."}
{"text":"We recently found a newspaper that had all the best of the bests food in Charlotte... So we decided to take it upon ourselves to see if they really are the best. The first stop was the Best Burger in Charlotte: Bad Daddy's Burger Bar. Now do I think it's the best... not totally. It does have good burgers but I wouldn't say it is the best. They have very interesting combinations of burgers that I wouldn't ever think of putting on a burger but it ended up being good. Their onion rings are HUGE! Definitely something that can be shared. I also love the fact that they offer tater tots. For some reason anytime I see a restaurant serves tater tots, it makes me so excited. They also have a full service bar. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere. It is very casual but the decor is pretty creative. They have cartoon pictures of their burgers so you can see how they build them and what exactly they put on the burgers. The only thing I would watch out for it the way the burger is cooked, when I ordered I got my burger Medium an it was undercooked. So If you like yours a little pink ask for medium well so you know it wont come out as pink as a medium did."}
{"text":"I have no complaints. Quick service, predictable prices. Sat at the bar, ordered the Western Burger (thumbs up) with tater tots. Was in and out in under 40 minutes."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a business trip for lunch. Three words - jalapeño pale ale. Quaint patio with fans provided the perfect amount of breeze on this sunny day. With locals running and cycling past, I might just move in. My bad ass burger was incredible to boot. If only they had this place back home."}
{"text":"Traveling is tough enough. Having to track down a server six times during breakfast is excessive. I simply: 1. Wanted to order 2. Wanted sweetener for the coffee 3. Wanted butter or jelly for the dry toast 4. Wanted a top off of my coffee 5. Wanted to get a check 6. Wanted to pay.  These seem like simple things. As for my breakfast, if you like grey/brown eggs... Eat here."}
{"text":"Average food. Expensive hamburgers. Been here twice. Both times the food was ok and I spent $25 on a burger and 2 beers. Bartenders were very social.  Fried Pickles are a fun starter.  I did enjoy the tater tots and onion strings."}
{"text":"Was excited to see a Bad Daddy's in the airport terminal and finally had a chance before one of my flights out to try it out.  The menu is pretty much the same as the regular Bad Daddy's locations, but I did notice some missing items (which was expected for a satellite airport location).  Not as many varieties of delicious burgers, but you can definitely still find something to eat here.  The hostess... was a bit tired, you could tell by the way she was slumped over the greeter's podium when I walked up.  She looked at me like \"what are you here for...\" and definitely did not start my experience on a good foot.  Eventually she figured out that I was there to eat and I just needed a table for 1 (after I told her)... most of the tables were filled up so I sat at the window where they have a ledge and bar stools for singles (smart set up for airports).  What the hostess lacked, my server made up for it by being friendly and prompt.  I got my black bean burger and tots... and most importantly my beer.  They didn't have much on tap, but they had bottles as well.  Burger was just as good as any of the other locations with the tots nice and crisp.  Airport prices here, but I still thought it was worth it once I got over the bad start to my lunch experience."}
{"text":"Love Big Daddys. I haven't had a bad burger hear yet. I think my favorite would have to be the Sam I Am.  There is also an awesome turkey burger option called the Frenchie.  The menu has other selections but this place is great for a beer and a burger. There is outdoor seating for a great summer evening meal.   My only complaint is the parking situation. You can usually find parking on the street.... and its probably good to walk off a hugely delicious meal.  If you have trouble deciding on your sides, you should because all of them are awesome.  My default are the TATER TOTS... can't go wrong with them!"}
{"text":"Despite living so close to the original Bad Daddy's this was my first visit to this location.  What usually scares me off is the parking situation.  But this time I got here at 11:30 and figured parking shouldn't be that bad.  Wrong.  Apparently the only time when parking is decent here is when they are closed.    But it wasn't that busy inside.  The bar was empty and all of the bar tables were available except one.  I started at the bar.  Seating at the bar is akward.  The bar itself is too high and it would make eating difficult.   So I moved to one of the bar tables.    It's been a while since my last visit to a Bad Daddy's so I realized they had changed their menu again.  My server was very helpful in explaining the menu and their special burger for the day.,  But I decided to be somewhat healthy and get a salad, Stella's Greek salad which is one of my favorite salads.    I also had a beer.  Bad Daddy's has a great selection of Charlotte and NC beers on tap.  The big 4 in Charlotte were represented (OMB, NoDa, Triple C, Birdsong) as well as one from Lonerider, Highlands and possibly a few others.    The salad was wonderful as always with chopped lettuce, kalamata olives, cukes, radishes and a light vinagrette.  The chicken was just a tad bit dry.  Still, Bad Daddy's is always consistently good.  The staff gets 5 stars on all of my visits.  The cons at this location are the bar height, the lack of seating space and the lack of parking.  If you can get by those, you'll enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"My first burger & tots came out like warmer. Manager was passing by & corrected swiftly and I was happily eating a hot burger.  Medium-rare and it was excellent. Nothing like smash burger but pretty darn good for an airport burger."}
{"text":"Big Daddy's gets it done in the burger department. Not only do they have 1 of my 2 favorite burger toppings (chili), the burger that it comes on is really good. You'll definitely need a large appetite & big mouth to tackle these burgers, but you won't be able to put them down. They do have other menu items other than the burger, but why would you try anything else?  This is another one of those options places, so if you have trouble making decisions (much like me) then be prepared to be blown away at your choices. They have conidments, toppings, premium toppings, bun selection, meat selection, cheese choice, wow...But it all equals up to a great burger with what you want on it, no rigid menu choices for me.  If headed for lunch, prepare for extra time, not only to find a parking spot & table, but also to finish your burger. But Big Daddy's is well worth the added time that your boss might not appreciate you using during lunch."}
{"text":"Burgers are good but the service is bad even for airport standards.  Do not be in any hurry if you go there....12 minutes to get a water after ordering a burger."}
{"text":"The best burger at the Charlotte airport but don't count on it getting to you fast.  The service is slow and typical airport as the servers are not concerned with repeat business.  The milkshakes are huge and not completely overpriced.  If you have at least an hour to kill and want a good burger and shake then check it out."}
{"text":"Oh so good!!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try out this burger joint for years now. Every time we try- it is PACKED with children. Really. I don't know how people go here in the evenings.  We finally arrived around 11ish on a Saturday and were able to find a spot. Really- I think it might be impossible at night.  There were still children everywhere.   The food: the tatter tots are hands down the best tots that I have ever had. Really, the best. Amazing tots.   The hamburgers are good. They are big. They cook them to order. There are lots of choices for the burgers. BUT THEY ARE SO EXPENSIVE. Really. We were surprised.   I just can't give 4 stars because we left underwhelmed.   (the salad selection did look good. we were fatties and didn't try it. Also, the manager and waitress were definitely on their game and excellent with costumers)"}
{"text":"Four visits, with kids and with friends.  All visits the same: On a wait.  Great unhealthy food.  OMB Copper on draft.  Good service.  Decent Price.  Pretty simple review, but there is nothing to dislike about this place. If you like burgers, tots, fries, beer and other good stuff.   There is parking across the street as well, which helps since lot is tiny.  Big Daddy Sauce is similar to a BBQ Ranch."}
{"text":"Big fan of Big Daddy Burgers and Tater Tots. The big daddy burger is amazing, the black bean burger is fantastic. All the best brews. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"Pros:  Good service            Good burgers  Cons: Horrible fries (tasted like they were soaked in grease)"}
{"text":"This is such a yupster place that I want to hate it, but I love it!  People watching definitely is a bonus (yup, it is!).  The burgers are AWE-some!  I keep trying different ones and I've loved them all.  I like the outdoor patio and even in rainy weather (as long as it's not too windy), it's a nice place to be.  There is a good tap beer selection and the servers have always been friendly.  Parking can be difficult.  They have breakfast too although I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Visited here last week and got my food to go, I didn't check didn't think about it. Never had to in the past.  Got home to finish my food and got a blackened chicken sandwich, I didn't ask for it that way. I always eat the chicken, very disappointed because it's good but this was not."}
{"text":"Love Bad Daddy's! Owned by the same gentleman that owns my favorite Charlotte restaurant, Mama Ricotta's.   My favorite meal choices are the Southern Burger made with a turkey burger and some slaw or a create your own salad with a turkey burger! Love it!  There's plenty of staff and I've never had to wait long to be seated, served, or to receive my food.   It is a small place with a full bar (have ever ordered an alcoholic beverage) and a number of flat screens. The place is family's friendly. My little ones have enjoyed the food each time we've stopped by."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday and never get bored.  Not just because there are so many selections and create your own options, but because it is so darn good.  The frenchie (turkey burger, brie, bacon, granny smith apples and a garlic mayo) changed my life.  Also, the fact that the servers always offer to give me a to-go cup for my soda really just elevates the entire experience.    I was first converted at the East Blvd. location, and was beyond thrilled to stumble upon it in Ballantyne, one fine day.    I'm not sure if there's a frequent/loyal customer badge (perhaps a VIP burger pass?), but I would love to get on board for that."}
{"text":"While being a burger place, I actually did not order a burger but a chicken sandwich--the buffalo chicken sandwich to be exact. It wasn't the best I've had in my life, but pretty darn delicious. I got regular fries, but wished I would have ordered the sweet potato fries. I kept trying to sneak more of my friend's fries. Dare I say they may be better than the sweet potato fries at Penguin Drive In?  We were here on a pretty busy night, but we got seated pretty quickly--which was nice. It seems to be a great place for groups/families, and there are some great choices for kids. I may go back here to actually try some of their red meat choices."}
{"text":"omg the best place ever!!! food is amazing and they are accommodating!!!! I am obsessed with there fried chicken and there make your own salad!!! Sometimes service can be a little slow but usually they are on it!!! WILL COME BACK MANY MORE TIMES!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers I have ever had!  Great atmosphere and incredible food!  Try the Cantina 1511 burger for a unique bean burger experience that won't disappoint. For the hard core meat-aholics try the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids.  They also have great beer specials including 24oz cans (sweet) and craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great, consistent place to grub at.  Their salads are phenomenal with the buttermilk fried chicken.   Tots are always done to perfection and I have never had a bad burger.  Very reasonably priced (cant speak to airport location)"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad.......but my meal was a big ol' greasy mess and hard to eat without utensils.......but shouldn't have needed utensils."}
{"text":"I am a burger aficionado. When I saw Bad Daddy's in the airport and not being from the area, I was immediately intrigued and had to try it.  My favorite burger chain is Five Guys. They are the gold standard for chain hamburgers in my opinion. Please keep in mind this review is for the Bad Daddy's burger only. I have no opinion on anything else. The service, the sides, etc.  I ordred the 'basic burger'. It's a single patty and comes with leafy green lettuce, tomato and onion on a standard white bun. I added american cheese. I figured this was the best option to get an idea of whether these guys are for real or not.  Standing at the take out window (cute as it's in the airport) the smell of caramelized beef wafted out of the kitchen. This encouraged me. That's the same smell that engulfs one upon a visit to the burger mecca, Five Guys.  Although the restaurant was very busy the burger arrived in a short 7 minutes.  I'll cut to the chase and spill the beans... Five Guys has nothing to worry about.   A great hamburger is all about the beef and this is where Bad Daddy's fell short. I ordered it cooked medium. It did indeed arrive medium. But the patty had little flavor. This despite having a nice caramelized crust on both sides. On top of having no flavor, it was also a tad chewy. Bad Daddy's claims to use a \"custom\" fresh ground beef blend. They could've fooled me. The burger tasted of frozen, low quality beef to my finely tuned taste buds.   I did like the bun, cheese, lettuce, and thick slice of tomato. But it wasn't enough to save the lackluster patty.  So, to sum up: The Bad Daddy's burger is ok, and will do in a pinch. But if you are looking for burger nirvana, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"best burger I have had in charlotte.  Always really packed and loud, but good enough to brave the noise and the crowd when I want to get my burger on."}
{"text":"I came here because of the hype about the fried pickles & I can assure u that the fried pickles are worth the visit! I ate those pickles & did a diddy bop the whole time ~ u know the food is good when u subconsciously do a dance ~~ if ur indecisive about what to drink ask for a sample ~ I probably got a tad tipsy from sampling beer lol ~   Did I mention how delicious the fried pickles were? Anyways ~ I created my own burger ~ nothing major & the fruit salad was good & refreshing too ~ thank gawd  The tot sauce is sweet & tangy ~~ I actually took some home hahahaha ~"}
{"text":"A pretty high class burger place. Make sure you order a side of \"Bad Daddy's Sauce\" for your burger or fries...really good stuff. Their chopped salads with burger or black bean patties are awesome as well! If you ever want to kick it at the bar with some friends, they always have great beers on tap...bartenders are very friendly as well as wait staff. Great casual joint in Ballantyne for a date, hanging with friends, or for a large group/family."}
{"text":"This was the first place I discovered on Yelp when I was on a trip to Charlotte. This place was amazing. I had their signature burger, which included a full bleu cheese salad INSIDE the burger. I live in California, and I enjoy me some In and Out and Islands for a good burger. However, I had the best burger ever at this place. They also serve Draft Root Beer!"}
{"text":"There is nothing new I can say here about Bad Daddy's.  This is another well run extension of the existing locations.  If you are new to Bad Daddy's then keep reading, otherwise you know what you are getting so why are you bothering to read this on Yelp?  Bad Daddy's is a solid burger place in a golden age of burgers.  Golden age as in Five Guys has replaced McDonalds, and we have Little Bi Burger etc.  A variety of good burger joints have all joined in to give us a lot of choices when choosing a burger.  In my opinion Bad Daddy's is the best, and for one reason - condiments.  The meat, bun, toppings, and other parts of the Bad Daddy's experience are excellent, but it is the condiments that put them a tier above the rest.  I love the hot and smokey ketchup they have, I also love the bad daddy sauce.  If you aren't over indulging in these condiments you are missing out on the quintessential bad daddy's experience.  After condiments are the battered pieces of bacon.  You have had bacon at other burger joints before, don't be fooled.  Let Bad Daddy's show you how they do bacon.  You can also ask for gluten free buns (and dairy free).  The staff might not be aware of these options (they know gluten free but may have no idea about butter free and therefore dairy free).  Get yourself a manager and they should know.  As of the writing of this review they had dairy free, but these things change all the time so be sure to ask."}
{"text":"I regret I didn't come to this place sooner.  The bad daddy sauce is not to be missed.  It has a bit of heat and some sweet and everything about it is perfect.  Make sure to ask for extra sauce.  I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was greasy and delicious.  Be cautious about wearing a nice shirt, you run the risk of some stains.  I won't be headed to five guys anymore, I will make the extra trip to really go all out.  I got some lackluster fries but to the star of the show is the burger."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a good burger, you'll find it at Bad Daddy's.  I'm never disappointed and they have some of the best sweet potato fries and tots around.   My go-to is the Classic Southern Burger (standard burger topped with chili and cole slaw).  It's not too often that you can order a burger topped with chili and it not at some point turn into a sloppy mess requiring an excessive amount of paper towels.  They do a nice job of not over doing it with toppings.  Oh, by the way, they offer free valet parking. I always forget about it until after I spend 20 minutes trying to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"The good: might be the best-tasting food at CLT. OK, not unqualified and stupendous praise given the competition, but my plain ol' burger was really pretty good. Bun was fresh, good grill-ish meat flavor, reasonably tasty veggies on top, good condiments including the onion straw dip. I was surprised, frankly.   The OK: $13 airport money, with tip. Just a burger and fries. Nothing else. Not too cheap, not a great value, but about par for airport food prices of that quality.  The bad: I wanted onion straws, not fries. It took a loooong time, or so it seemed, to get my food - not a good choice for a 1-hour layover unless you like living dangerously. The bartender was not too familiar with Southern hospitality. More of a backwoods-bar bouncer vibe.   Go there, I guess. I'll probably be back if I'm too hungry to make it to my next stop."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. They aren't the best burgers in town, but the service is top notch and the food is great for the price. Each time I've gone the server has been attentive and willing to accommodate me. This is where I finally filled my mac n cheese craving. It was so yummy. Super creamy and cheesy with just a few other ingredients to compliment the flavors. I have been dying to sit outside, unfortunately every time I get there the patio is full and I'm usually way to hungry to sit around and wait. The most recent time around I ordered the portabella burger with pimento cheese. MMMMMM. I want to go back and maybe try some of the desserts and maybe finally get my chance to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Been here at least three times and so far each time gets better. The staff are very friendly and they sure know how to turn a stressed, worn out Anatomy student into a happy, relaxed student by giving me a on the house drink of Parched Dragon. I already love this place, but with these courteous staff I'm definitely coming back down for round two! On top of that, they do serve one of the best burgers in Charlotte, definitely my top one in Ballantyne.  Burger recommendations: Bad Ass Burger or Pittsburgher  Sides: Tater Tots Drink: Definitely the Parched Dragon! Appetizer: Daddy's Nachos"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for an early dinner. The food was alright but could have been better. Our waitress was wonderful and I wish I could remember her name. But the state of the place - Come On!  From the moment we walked in, it just looks dirty. Plain and simple. Unswept, littered with bits and pieces of napkin, straw wrapper pieces, even some food particles. The booth we were led to had seats that also had trash on them, clearly not wiped down. The place is staffed to the hilt, more than enough young able-bodied people to be cleaning up the place. Instead, they loitered around if they had no one to wait on. And the bathrooms, more of the same. Two waitresses came through during my trip to the ladies room, so somebody with eyes could have seen the need to clean.   Mismanagement of staff.  It was like this the last time we went as well, but I hoped it was just a busy night. I think we'll steer clear for a while and see if they can get their act together."}
{"text":"Wow! Badass Burger was awesome. Paired with Sweet potato fries and I was a very happy camper. Service was excellent but then again it was about 3 pm so it was not crowded. Highly recommended for burger buffs."}
{"text":"I've been to the Dilworth and Ballantyne locations often, mostly because some of my friends like it.  I have to say that the food has always been pretty good and the ingredients are fresh.    We almost always get some kind of burger and fries or tots.  I've had the fried pickles and nachos too.  The pickles are pretty good and the nachos are fair.  I have also noticed that the wait to get your food can take quite a while which can be a headache when you are there on your lunch break.  Also the price of the burger/fries combined with a drink and tip can start to get a little pricey."}
{"text":"Great burgers.  The burger menu is a little odd so you may have to build your own.  Get that tator tots, they were bad ass!"}
{"text":"Incredible burgers, and super attentive Waite staff. We had a party of 10 who all ordered unique \"make your own\" burgers, and each came out perfect!  A much better choice than the chain joints."}
{"text":"So after having a not so stellar experience our first time visiting this establishment three years ago, we finally decided to give Bad Daddy's another try. This was after literally all of our friends telling us how fantastic the place can be. So we headed to BD last night around 7pm. The tables were all full but we only had to wait five minutes. Parking is a bit of a mess, so keep that in mind when heading in to eat. The lot is very small, but there is street parking and a lot across the street that you can park in after 6pm.   We decided to forgo appetizers for a cookies and cream spiked milkshake, which was unbelievably good (apparently they make the ice cream in-house). If you are of age, I definitely recommend partaking in one of those beauties. I ordered the Frenchie, which is a turkey burger with brie, apple slices and bacon. I added avocado and passed on the garlic mayo. And be sure to get the sweet potato fries with the chipotle ranch. Best in town.   You may want to pass on dessert - I'd recommend a spiked milk shake instead. We found the banana pudding to be too sweet (which is a big deal for me to say as I have a crazy sweet tooth) and the brownie sundae was not good at all - I ate the homemade ice cream but the brownie was hard as a rock and tasted like something that came out of a wrapper.   Did I mention the spiked milkshake? I didn't? Well definitely get one of those; it's a party in your mouth. Yummers."}
{"text":"great vegetarian option! the black bean burger is delicious. thick patty, flavorful, appears made in-house. Cameron's 1511 burger was great if you like a little spicy, but you can get that patty on every burger. sweet potatoes gross also yummy."}
{"text":"Hell Yeah!  A Hot, freshly cooked all beef burger, cooked properly with an ice cold beer at 11am !  Did I mention you can get a double shot for just $3 more!"}
{"text":"My server was nice But that was it  My food came out wrong twice and I had to leave to catch my plane  All I asked was to have my bread not to have no seeds and not use rye bread and to have a wheat roll  Food came back cold and looked liked the cook was upset that he had to do it over  Payed the bill and gave a good tip I plan on eating on the next airport"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's Burger Bar has become a Dilworth mainstay and operates two other locations in Ballantyne and in Birkdale. Prior to becoming Bad Daddy's (formerly Big Daddy's) this location was one of the cursed spots on East Boulevard that just could not seem to make it. Now the restaurant fills up early, with lines forming and families, couples and singles alike flock for the signature burgers and salads.  Our first time actually dining in (we've ordered takeout several times) we enjoyed a fine meal and decent service. The noise level is higher than I'd like, however, so maybe takeout - or the patio in cooler weather - is more my speed. The Daddy's nachos were enjoyed by all - a hefty portion with chili, black beans, guacamole, queso, sour cream and more. I enjoyed the Asian salad and a bite of the Sam I Am burger - beef burger topped with American cheese, a fried egg, rosemary ham and pesto sauce. There are several alternatives for non-burger fans, which is nice: several chopped salads including a Greek and the Asian Salad (below) ; you can also build your own salad or your own burger and chicken, tuna, black bean and turkey burger versions are available, so everyone should be happy! There are a multitude of toppings and cheeses that can be added to both burgers and salads - a fun option.  The milkshake was a bit thin for my taste but I really wanted to try the Nutella version, which wasn't available the night we dined in. Although not my favorite burger joint around, Bad Daddy's is a fun option to eat with the \"in\" crowd - and it's family friendly to boot."}
{"text":"My first experience at Bad Daddy's was amazing! Our server Patrick was amazing and whoever made our drinks is a God Send. The atmosphere is laid back and cool. Kid friendly. I have a two year old who is in the tantrum phase no one batted an eye at us when he would cry. Patrick just kept the apple juice coming! The Buffalo wings were the best I've had in a long time. I ordered the southern burger (Slaw, lettuce, tomato, chili, and relish). It was so good I ate the whole thing. It's not your average burger, it's pretty big. I will definitely be back and trying different items from the menu. GREAT, CLEAN, and FRIENDLY establishment!"}
{"text":"I love Bad Daddy's. I've been five or six times, and I've enjoyed it each time. I'm pretty basic when it comes to burgers - I usually get the Build Your Own Burger on Texas Toast, a medium patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles and mustard. I've always gotten the tater tots as a side and I've never been disappointed.  The last time my sister and I went, we each did a small Build Your Own Salad as an appetizer. In the past, we've tried the wings and the homemade potato chips as appetizers and weren't really impressed. The salads were yummy and we'll do that again. We also tried the milkshakes for dessert and loved them - I got the Oreo and she got the Chocolate and Peanut Butter one.  All in all, I highly recommend Bad Daddy's and it's one of my favorite places in Charlotte. The parking is terrible though so that's why I took off a star. We usually try to go for an early or late dinner to beat the craziness and that usually works. I'm looking forward to going to Bad Daddy's again soon!"}
{"text":"I just flew from Las Vegas to Charlotte with a layover on my way to Pittsburgh.  It was a long flight and I just wanted someplace with decent coffee and I could get good service.  The choices that early in the morning were limited and Bad Daddy's had just opened. I ordered a coffee and their breakfast platter.  All over it was terrible.  The coffee was super strong with grounds in the bottom.  I was never offered a refill (and wouldn't have taken it any way).  I'm not sure how you can screw up breakfast food but it was bad.  The rye toast had --maybe -- a slight tan -- it certainly wasn't toasted.  They gave me grape jelly and frozen butter but threw it on the plate in the middle of the eggs.  The only decent part was the sausage.  Even the eggs tasted burnt and oily on the bottom.  Avoid (at all costs) for breakfast.  Trust me!!"}
{"text":"Solid hot breakfast. This is the only place in the whole airport that offers actual eggs in addition to the nasty pasteurized liquid egg stuff used everywhere else. While they still use the fake liquid eggs in their scrambles, you can order like two eggs over easy and get actual eggs. Win!  One point off because they got my order wrong (I ordered toast, potatoes, and eggs and got bacon, toast, and eggs) and because the bread used to make the toast was low quality and made with chemical dough softeners and preservatives.   Service was great. This may be your best choice for a hot breakfast if, like me, you're looking for something as close natural as possible."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of burgers but Bad Daddy's changed that! Best burgers...so many options! Love the grilled buffalo chicken! Lots of healthy options! Could eat here weekly!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Bad Daddy's in awhile...since it was Big Daddy's. The food just didn't taste as good as I remember it being.  I went with the Cantina burger which while still pretty ok wasn't anything super special. I liked the flavor  but it needed something else -perhaps Guacamole instead of just avocado. I was also a bit put off that they use canned jalapeno ..I feel like peppers are pretty cheap and the canned ones were just mushy, unsightly and not spicy enough. My fries tasted good but weren't crispy at all so I would get something else next time.    Our server though friendly enough didn't bring out our meal, any extra's we needed, or even the correct side (they brought out the wrong side for my boyfriend). He just wasn't all that present.   Overall the food and service were just ok. Sure id go back but it wasn't as fabulous as I last remembered unfortunately so it won't be a top choice for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the airport between flights.  I ordered the Make Your Own Omelet with chunk potatoes and toast.  It hit the spot for a breakfast meal, and the staff was quick but not super friendly.  They were fairly busy and they seemed to keep up pretty well.  There were not too many options, so this seemed to be the best of the bunch.  I would stop back in if I'm in the airport again at breakfast time."}
{"text":"They offer a Kobe Beef burger on their menu for an additional price. Funny thing is, it's NOT really  Kobe Beef. There's only several places authorized in the U.S that can sell and offer Kobe Beef if you refer the the website for the Kobe Beef Association. Those several privileged enough to offer Kobe beef would be proud to show you their golden Kobe beef statue AND an official certificate. The manager and owner of Big Daddy's are scamming consumers."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the area. One of my favorite places"}
{"text":"This place is great for a good burger and tots. Prices are very reasonable and it's a fun setting for dinner. They also have delicious spiked milkshakes and plenty of flavors to choose from. I tend to bring friends here who are passing through Charlotte when they're looking for a good spot to eat at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"A definite must-stop in Birkdale Village or the Huntersville area. Great menu options plus an extensive \"build your own\" burger and salad option. The shakes? Crazy good - try the Chunky Elvis with banana, chocolate, peanut butter and walnuts!"}
{"text":"Had a delightful mushroom burger with the perfect complimentary aioli sauce and a soft bun that hit all the right notes. The mushrooms were full of flavor and so was the burger patty. One of the other options I looked at had buttermilk bacon on it. I tried a bite from my friend and holy smokes it was ridiculously good because the breading on it was flavorful and crisp. His burger was piled so high with the buttermilk bacon, he couldn't fit it in his mouth. And let's not forget the milkshakes. I had the Elvis, with the right mix of peanut butter and chunks of banana. When the shake is first served, you definitely need a spoon to eat it because it's so thick. Next time I'm in Charlotte, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Damned great burgers!  Love the atmosphere and the staff.  I'm there every time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Adding this to my Yelp list for Best Salads in Charlotte. You can't go wrong with their build your own salad. The portion and the price are great. The ingredients are fresh and how can you complain when you pick what you want?  From the menu, my absolute favorite is the Texican salad which is a sinful treat of fried chicken on a bed of lettuce - with a little spice from the chipotle ranch and the chopped cilantro adds a nice punch.   They get 5 stars from me because they're a local company (I think), the food is signature - meaning it's not like anywhere else. AND they put some effort into the salads. Impressive for a burger joint.   This is a standing favorite place for our family and the burgers and tots never miss. I've never had a bad meal, bad experience or bad service here."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly, had excellent service and were in and out in 30 minutes.  The black bean burger was amazing, I will definitely get it again.  My husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich it was good, the cheese was melted perfectly, but the chicken could have been more tender.  The sweet potato fries were on point.  For an airport restaurant.... I recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of the best black bean burgers in charlotte that's a fact!  Bad Daddys is the best of both worlds... you can eat healthy or get a juicy burger with fries or tots and a milkshake!  There is a large variety of options on the menu, making this a good choice for lunch or dinner especially for picky eaters.  Anything can be customized.  I ordered the Moscow Mule to start.  I don't like my mules too sweet and this one was perfect!!  I ordered the cantina black bean burger with a create your own side salad.  It was a generous portion and the food came out promptly.  My husband ordered the Magic Mushroom burger and he enjoyed it very much.  It was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  Our service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great environment, friendly staff, excellent porch, and fantastic location in Dilworth.    We just went today and it was only okay.  I like everything about Bad Daddy's except for the burgers, which was to be the star of our lunch.    I'm sitting here writing this review wishing I had just ordered a spiked milkshake.  It's over 100 degrees outside and that's definitely what I should have done.  I ordered the Bad Ass Burger with Chips.  The burger was absolutely dripping in a thick oily grease.  I ended up having to put it on paper towels and tried to dry it out.  I ended up having to just stop trying and I split a burger with my bride... that one was single burger (patted down from grease) with avocado and bacon.  It was better but still lacking.    Here's the part that really stunk... we each ordered a burger and two diet cokes and the total was $30+$6 tip.  For $36, I could have had a better burger & coke.  I will go back but will need to try some different things."}
{"text":"I don't even eat burgers, but Bad Daddy's has still been on my list for a while. A rainy Friday that I took a personal day from work seemed like the perfect time for a lunch date. Busy for lunch so we snagged some seats at the bar. Liz (I think. Have to get better at this) was very attentive throughout the meal.   We started with nachos...because we are addicted to nachos. They were good, nothing really special. Great guac. After that massive appetizer I felt like I needed some lettuce so I got the Texicorn Salad. PSA: Not actually healthy at all-- fried chicken and mayo based dressing.  I am not kidding when I say I made 3 meals out of that salad throughout the weekend though. Huge! Tasted really fresh and I loved the dressing. Would get again. Boyfriend got the burger that was on special and he really enjoyed it. Huge as well. I stole a couple of his fries and they were very good.  I definitely want to go back and try a sandwich-- as well as enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"I know this is a crowd favorite, but it really didn't blow me away.  I would appreciate a more flavorful burger patty.  I had a burger with pimento cheese on it which hit the spot.  Would like to try the one on Texas toast next time. Wish I had room for a milkshake - they sounded amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that I'm not a huge burger fan but recently tried the bacon cheeseburger at Bad Daddy's and it was everything & then some. The bacon was so thick & taste amazing on its own I almost wanted to just pick it off & eat it by itself. The fries were handcut & the sauce they provide to dip them in reminds me of chickfila sauce which is not a bad thing as chickfila sauce is awesome! Hands down best burger I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Apparently there are a lot of people who like Big Daddy's, and I can't say that I completely blame them.  There is a lot to like.  Unfortunately, there is also plenty not to like about the place.  Start with the waiting.  We all know, thanks to Tom Petty, that the waiting is the hardest part, and the best I can say about Big Daddy's is that it comes in stages.  First you wait for a place to park.  There is a small lot directly behind the restaurant, but it appears to almost always be packed.  There is also another lot somewhat adjacent and across the street, but it's tough to see, especially after dark, and there are other lots up East Boulevard that explicitly say not to park there for Big Daddy's, so be careful where you decide to park.  Also keep an eye out for morons saving spaces for friends because they are going to stand in the spot and not pay attention to you as you pull in/out.  That's how adamant they are that they are going to get that spot.  Alternative, just run them over.  Maybe it will help get rid of them.  Next you're going to have to wait for your table.  They do have those light up pager thingamabobs, so you don't have to wait for them to call your name (and hope that you hear it), but you'll still have to wait until yours lights up, and then make your way back to the front and everything.  I'd suggest grabbing a menu and looking it over - especially if you have kids and/or a family that can't decide easily because the menu is huge and it'll take some time.  Use it wisely.  For some good news, once you sit down, the service is pretty decent for a while.  You'll see a server, and you will probably get some drinks fairly rapidly.  You may even be able to place your order (assuming you were able to decide what you wanted).  Just make sure you don't take too long, because the servers do have a tendency to disappear for long stretches.  Also make sure you don't mind loud noises of any sort, because there is a constant buzz in the place and there is also a tendency for large families to send that buzz up a few notches when kids who have been waiting push each other over the edge.  Once you have managed to place your order, you get to wait again.  Not sure why, really, except that they are just slow perhaps.  But with everyone waiting, maybe it's just that the staff didn't want to feel left out, so now they get to take their turn.  Unfortunately it's the kitchen staff (as in delivering your food to the servers) or perhaps the servers (as in the food sits and waits for them to deliver to you) and in the meantime your drinks often run dry (so maybe the cooks are fine and it's just the servers).  Eventually you will get your food - though you may not have any drinks to go with it - and you'll find that in a few bites your burger will be gone.  As has been mentioned elsewhere, these are some pricey meals, and though they are reasonably tasty, they are probably not worth it.  We tried a pretty good variety of meals, from the standard burger (with bacon and cheese added) to the mama ricotta (italian) burger to the western (buffalo) burger and the cantina 1511 (black bean) burger, and while good, they were gone quickly.  The starches - regular fries, sweet potato fries and tater tots - were all quite good (the tater tots were actually the best and crispiest), and the sauces that came with them were good as well.  It's just too much waiting for not enough food that really wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews... but I will definitely come back here. Great Sevice, atmosphere and experience .      This is my 7th time to Charlotte, and it is taking some time to find the places I like. Food is so important to me in the quality of life. If you are visiting, please try this place. They will surprise you."}
{"text":"That chipotle spicy mayo sauce.....dead It's my wife and I first time eating here and anytime we are in Charlette or passing thru the airport we will most def stop in and eat here."}
{"text":"Attentive and quick service, good food selection. The only down side is the parking for lunch be prepared to walk."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich with lettuce wrap. It was good. Chicken was large and spicy. Not dry at all. I got the tater tots and they were crispy. The sauce that came with it was amazing."}
{"text":"Had the best fried pickles as an app they were better than any others I eaten. I also had a bad ass burger and it was so good cooked to perfection and very flavorful.  I'm writing this post the day after eating that tasty burger because I needed a day the self reflect on how good the burger was. I was just day dreaming about it and would recommend them to anyone who in the mood for a delicious burger. Cheers"}
{"text":"Back again for burgers and salad. Brought people with us this time and they loved it. Our servers name was Daniel, who we asked for personally being we have had him several times before. He is excellent! Ask for him next time you want a burger or salad. Love this place"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner. Big Daddy's looked like a fun place. It was busy and lots of people were working, but the service was slow food and my food came out wrong. Won't go back!"}
{"text":"I don't do airport burgers for fear of a return visit ;) however w delays and not many options I popped in. Great energy and music. Very tough stools for a single. I went w the black burger and it was quite tasty when I got to shove on a bunch of stuff I love on top. And they have tots!"}
{"text":"Like the name suggests, they've got burgers from Basic to Bad Ass and everything in between. Their menu takes your average burger to the next level. They also have burgers that range from tuna (which I had) to chicken and turkey (which my wife had) to buffalo. If you don't see what you like, you can build your own burger. There are enough proteins, toppings and condiments to make your burger dreams come true."}
{"text":"I think this is such a great option for vegetarians or vegans! I absolutely love the lettuce wrap bean burger! The create your own salads are always fantastic as well!  My husband is a meat eater so when we frequent this establishment we get the best of both worlds. The have a variety of drink specials and always a special artisan burger of the month.  I cannot wait till they finish building the location in Weddington."}
{"text":"Big Daddy Burger Bar makes most all other burgers obsolete.  They'll be ruined to you after a visit here.  The meat is high-quality, the sides are good (as long as you like potatoes).  My favorite is the Buffalo Burger which is buffalo meat, cheese, BBQ sauce...yum.  Buffalo's are tasty.  Salads are good too if you're not into burgers and I like that you can make your own sandwich if you don't like their choices.  Most of the sides are potato-based which is the only disappointment I have.    Wednesday is Bring Your Own Mug Night so expect a crowd.  I think I saw a guy show up with a boot!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Dilworth location and found it to be SUPER busy (of course it was BYOM night) the next time I wanted a really good burger, we headed to the Ballantyne location.  More seating, more parking, same great food and service.  Ballantyne can fill up too.    I would recommend that you follow them on Twitter at @BigDaddysCLT as they host tweetups, have twitter-only specials, and more.  One visit was to celebrate potato chip day and we received free chips and dip just by saying we saw it on twitter.  NICE!"}
{"text":"For airport food this spot is solid. Breakfast options were plentiful and they had super fresh avocado. Our sever, I think his name was Brandon bc that's the name on our receipt, was so attentive and had us laughing. Super personable guy and fast, which makes all the difference at an airport restaurant. Thanks Eater for the article on this airport's food options."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! My wife and I recently moved down here from NY and from the drinks to the food we were thourougly impressed. The customer service was amazing and we truly enjoyed ourselves while we were here. We would recommend this place to anyone who has just moved down here or is simply passing through Charlotte."}
{"text":"The eggs were runny, the sausage greasy and burnt and there was a hair on the toast. Never coming back."}
{"text":"So, I'm just going to Pro/Con this one. I really loved this place, but my stomach hated me after. I wish I could 3.5 star this.   Pro: - You will see God when you eat those fried pickles - Service is great. Attentive but not in your face  - Beer is cold and bubbly - Burger is huge - Lot of options and you can even create your own if you don't see one you like.  - Family friendly - Seating both inside and outside - They support local breweries. A lot of the beers on tap were from Charlotte breweries - Delicious  Con: - Biggest one and why it's 3 stars instead of 4: Maybe it was the burger being \"Medium\" but my stomach really did not agree with me later in the day - It's greasy (could be a pro depending on how you look at it) and I'm willing to say with 90% certainty unhealthy for you - Homemade potato chips aren't anything to write home about  I'd go back again, but I think I'll ask for my burger to be cooked a little more well-done."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Fun place. Great staff. Try the badass burger. It's huge.  Sam I am is the best.  Good beer selection too"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place... Patty melt is amazing. Sweet potato fries are killer. And the Fried Pickles are INCREDIBLE."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the burgers.  Just average. Service was good. Kids meals are reasonably priced. Might be back."}
{"text":"Came in here since it was our first time in the Ballantyne area, but we've been to their other location on East Boulevard.  The Thursday drink special was pretty good - 20oz. for the price of a pint on any draught beer, with pretty good selections, not just the run of the mill american lagers.  The server (I forgot his name) was extremely helpful and made it a more positive experience.  I even told him personally that I enjoyed this visit versus the trip to the East Blvd location.    My wife and I split the Chicken Club burger w/ sweet potato fries and a small create-your-own salad.  The chicken club was well cooked with a nice sized portion of chicken, enough ham, and tasteful bacon.  A great alternative to the beef burgers even though they're known to be one of the best. The chicken club is more than enough for one person and the small salad is not enough for me.  Luckily we split the difference and was able to get a full balanced meal out of it.    And of course we couldn't leave without taking the salted caramel pretzel milkshake to go.  I'm addicted to desserts, so I couldn't stop slurping it on the way home.    I would come here again and bring others for the food, service, and specials!  Next time, I'll try a famous burger and that may provide the 5th star."}
{"text":"Traveling from Turks & Caicos back to Connecticut, we had the pleasure of stopping in Charlotte for a short layover. We only had 50 or so minutes to eat and get to our gate, so we booked it to Bad Daddy's. It was packed, but the hostess got us seated and we ordered our food relatively quickly. It took a while for the food to come and the check (we waited about 30 minutes for our food), but all was forgiven when we bit into our delicious burgers.  I ordered the Magic Mushroom burger and it was great. It was perfectly cooked and the truffle aioli simply made it! I had some house made potato chips on the side, which were pretty good, but the sweet potato fries really stole the show. The next time I get a layover in Charlotte, I know where I'm going for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was a little confused on what this place was actually trying to be - a neighborhood pub or a private Fuddruckers.  Went here for lunch on Saturday and the place was hopping with the 25 year olds watching the football games or relaxing outside and the families with the kids eating burgers and drinking shakes.  Tried the southern burger with chili, relish, american cheese, and chipotle mayo - quite interesting and definately turned my normally iron-clad stomach.  my wife had the black bean burger and said it was awesome.  Tater tots reminded me of kindergarten...what fun!"}
{"text":"Legit amazing burgers and sweet potato fries! Literally can't say anything bad about this place; we were sat immediately, our waitress was on point with water and accommodating to our food requests....it hit the burger craving spot on and for fairly inexpensive: $25 for two meals at the airport? Yes please."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with friendly service. The burgers are amazing, super juicy and full of flavor. And omg the buttermilk fried bacon is MVP. I was visiting from Savannah GA and I'm so glad I ended up eating here."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and the food both times did not disappoint. You can't go wrong with a a place that serves your burger any way you want it and carries a nice variety of drafts.  Knocked it down a star for the hostess that sat me, my husband, and toddler at a table meant for two, not three. We ordered an appetizer, two burgers, and a kids grilled cheese. Our plates were sitting on top of each other to the point where you couldn't even see the table anymore."}
{"text":"Very busy and if your in a hurry not the best place to go in between flights. However if you have a minute the food was good and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"The Southern burger with chili and slaw is absolutely awesome. Burgers come out cooked just the temperature you like and you can build your own if you desire. Sweet potato fries are great and so are tater tots. Service was very good as well even during a busy time."}
{"text":"Some of the best (and most creative) burgers in town. The Frenchie is incredible - turkey burger with apples, brie and special sauce. Their create your own salads are great, too! Fantastic drink specials and amazing milkshakes, too!"}
{"text":"I have major love for the Bad Daddy's East Blvd. location, so, naturally, I figured I would enjoy the Ballantyne digs! And I was right. Allow me to break it down for you...  Location: Right off of Johnston Rd/521. You'll find plenty of parking spots!   Layout: Wider and much flatter than the East Blvd. location. It was still quite busy during a Sunday afternoon lunch but not nearly as packed in as their other location. The patio (covered in the cooler months) is a nice addition, too! The bar also looks quite spacious.   Menu: The same delicious burgers and sandwich concoctions you're used to. My favorite is the Frenchie...amazing grilled Granny smith apples, turkey burger and smothered with Brie and a touch of special mayo. Get it with a design your own salad...chipotle ranch dressing FTW. Their milkshake and beer lists are pretty extensive, too!   Service: Attentive, helpful and fairly quick even when they're busy!   If you get a chance, always ask about their burger of the day...it's usually a winner. It's good to be bad...daddy's."}
{"text":"Fun and often very busy. They have a get on the wait list feature from inside yelp which doesn't actually save you any time so don't bother with that.   Good local beer selection. They have creative burger choices and you can make your own of any combo. Same with the salad. Even get a burger on the salad."}
{"text":"You can see by the number of reviews that this place is popular. I really like the burgers but they have other good food too. Nice brunch  esp when the weather is nice. Very fresh food and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Good Burgers, but they were extremely rare. Medium-Rare is basically rare at any other restaurant. Order it cooked well."}
{"text":"I had the black bean burger and it was great.  Fries were a little over cooked but all in all good food."}
{"text":"The pb & j milkshake is something you don't wanna miss, as well as the banana pudding (enough to share with 4 people) burgers are phenomenal, fries are delicious, nachos are killer. Not to mention they have jalapeño pale ale on tap!!! Keep going back for more and not disappointed"}
{"text":"Ok so the burger situation here is clearly something serious! I got the Bacon cheeseburger on steroids and I added a fried egg... so now we are talking 6 pieces of bacon and a fried egg! This was an amazing burger! I got sweet potato fries and nachos as an app!   Now for the environment, it was crowded! Like literally wall to wall, every seat filled on a 30-45 min rotation. The parking is a situation especially on a Friday night because of the location.   Overall the burger was well worth the horrid parking situation and the 30 min wait."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is a cool Burger joint. I went a couple nights ago and they weren't too busy. The ambience was nothing to brag about. Our Server Cory was friendly and very professional. He checked in on us to make sure the food was good and to see if we needed anything. I had the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids*,sweet potato fries with a glass of The Seeker and my son had a Slider with French fries. My Son complemented that the burger  was so good."}
{"text":"I was all ready to give them three stars because it's über hard for me to justify 4 or more in an airport. The servers are quick and efficient. There is space to roll your luggage to your table which is key in airports. But then my order of chicken wings came out. The flavor was good. The bleu cheese dressing was good and the celery crisp. But then there were the wings. The skin was flaccid! They were cooked but the skin was fatty and loose. :( A few more minutes in the fryer would have been perfect. But no. :( I salvaged some of it and then just ate the meat. So sad."}
{"text":"Defintely have to agree this is one of the better airport eateries.  It has a wife variety of tasty burgers, and they are cooked very well.  I am also a sucker for their sweet potato fries,  which I would go back just for them!  As usually the beer and liquor drinks are very expensive (but it always is at airports).  I would advice not to get their apple pie \"a la mode\" it was disappointing.  The ice cream was soft serve which is fine but it just didn't taste like \"real\" soft served ice cream, and their apple pie was just alright.    The service and wait staff is above average and rather attentive.  I would defintely go back for the sweet potato fries, and burgers! yum yum good! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big burger person but Bad Daddy's has the BEST burgers I have ever tried! We've always had great service and perfectly cooked food. Build your own burger is the best way to go. Great beer selection as well. Highly recommend if you're in the birkdale area or looking for a great place to grab burger."}
{"text":"I had the classic southern Burger cooked medium to perfection. It was delicious! Compared to five guys it was definitely more flavorful and the Burger itself was more juicy. It is a bit on the expensive side, but is unique and comparable to Foster's grille."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here during our layover to Atlanta and let me tell you for stopping to sit down and eat at the airport this place was very good. The atmosphere was great with some exposed brick and had a lot of tvs with news, sports, etc on. We came for breakfast actually and the food was great. The service was excellent as well, very polite and came to ya right away for refills and to clean off tables. If I am ever back in the airport here I will 100% be back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"When I am craving for a burger, I visit this place and found this amazing each and every time I been here. I loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Love the 6 oz burgers. Great drinks and fries. They are a little high priced though."}
{"text":"Great beer list. The food is always up to par! The staff is so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"To start off: the service at bad daddy's is great. If you have the luck to have Alexis as your waiter you can expect really good service. Many of my friends say that bad daddy's has the best burgers. Even though I don't share that opinion they still have really good ones. Their burgers are always really juicy. Trying the daily special is also something you won't regret."}
{"text":"Great food absolutely crappy service. My appetizer came out the same time my food did. I asked for medium burger got well done."}
{"text":"Normally I would give this place 1 star, but it is packed into a small space and very busy.  Great concept, great recipes, poor execution.  I had the Sam I am burger.  The yolk was popped and died up in a sticky mess next to and user the burger.  The wait staff is resigned to the craziness and over worked in non stop rushes.  The unsweetened ice tea tasted like dirty water.  The sweet potato fries were good."}
{"text":"I really like this location compare to the Mooresville location. I got the BYO salad and it was awesome. Their shakes are good too!"}
{"text":"Great tuna burger! Nice laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Gate C, just a few steps down from where my plane let out was this place. The idea of a burger for lunch after having only 1/2 a sandwich for breakfast - one that was dry over all.. was really a great idea.   The husbeast concurred and we stopped in. I want to say the greeters were friendly, but they were carrying on a conversation and we waited about 30 seconds to be acknowledged, Once acknowledged, we were finally sat. The place was HOPPING! Busy, and I guess that's to be expected. The burger selection is huge - as to be expected from a Burger Bar. And the food is tasty. I had a make your own burger - with tots. HOLY CRAP the amount of tots they gave me was pretty large. The husbeast had one of their Bacon Cheese burgers on Steroids with fries. He loved it.   The service was a bit slow, but given the amount of folks there, That could be forgiven."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger spots in charlotte. I've been to several of their locations and th hey are always consistent. Never have had a disappointing night at bad daddy's. Make sure to come here ready to eat because you will want to eat everything on the plate. It's always a toss up between the bacon burger on steroids and Emilio's chicken. Bothe arr absolutely fantastic. The chicken is juicy and tender and the burgers are mouthwatering and cooked to perfection. Not to mention three different types of bacon on a single burger... you can't beat that. The sides are always delicious. Usually go with tots which are always fresh and hot. If you and the boys are starving and looking to demolish some burgers swing through bad daddy's. There will be no dissapointment."}
{"text":"We are here visiting from Florida and wanted to try something different. So we decided on this place.  Great atmosphere little small on the inside if you have a group over 5.  They said they could not move tables together on the inside.  The appetizer came out pretty quick with in about 15 minutes from ordering. But our burgers and kids meal took about an hour to come out.  The table next to us was seated after us and had their appetizers and burgers come out before ours.   We asked when our food will be out and the waitress said that we are next. My Bad Ass burger was dry and was medium rare ( ordered medium).  Definitely sitting there for a while  The buttermilk fried was all batter that I could not taste the bacon. I had to pull off two pieces.  The horseradish mayo had not kick. Taste like regular mayo. Tater tots were pretty good. Fried pickles were also pretty good."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best burgers ive eaten in charlotte in a long time. Eastfield can hold there own but this takes the cake. Better then the penguin in its prime. I had the bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and i love the chipotle sauce that came with it. My tater tots where crispy and perfect. This will be a regular place that i will come to get burgers from now on possibly the best in charlotte"}
{"text":"Tied with counter burger for best burger in Charlotte, although Big Daddy's has more of a neighborhood restaurant feel and is more fun.  Plenty of options, great place for dinner or to watch a game.  The make-your-own salads are very good, and they are offered as a side to a burger.  Many good beers on tap.  Skip the milkshake."}
{"text":"Good burger, good waitress. Just good thing it's at the airport. Not exactly sure would have went out of the way for it if it was in general public area."}
{"text":"I came here because my dad is in town and he wanted a turkey burger. So I used good ole Yelp to find a place with good reviews for their turkey burgers. This place seemed to have the best reviews.   I visited on a windy Saturday in April. It's a pretty small diner. Lots of families with kids. A little noisy. They had wifi which is a plus.   We both ordered the turkey burger aka \"The Frenchie\". Dad had his in a bowl (no bread bcuz of the diet he's on) with grilled onions that looked disgusting and he said the tasted disgusting as well. Fresh fruit was his side (nothing exciting about that).   I had The Frenchie without the garlic mayo. It had Brie, bacon, onions, tomato, lettuce, Apple, and pickle. I took off the onions and the burger was delish. Meat was crispy on the outside just how I like my burgers and the flavors from the Brie, Apple, bacon and pickles complemented each other well. I upgraded my fries to the truffle fries (extra $2). These were my least favorite truffle fries I've had. They were fresh cut which I love, but pretty much flavorless (you'll need to add salt). The best part of the fries was the creamy truffle aioli. I dipped my fries and burger in it. Tasted great on both.   All-in-all the meal was just ok and for the two burgers and two waters the bill was a little over $25. It's rather pricey and the food and atmosphere wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions. The burgers are very good. Nice selection of beer on draft. Milkshakes are very good. Forget the wings unless your feeding a five year old. The wings looked like they were from a quail, they were so small. It's a burger, beer and shakes place."}
{"text":"Food is ok, same as the service.  I fly into CLT at least twice a month and every time I walk by this place since it's been open it has that wet moldy towell smell.  I have been going thru this airport for years since I fly US Airways so I always have a connection.  Anyone reading this and thinks I'm just another crazy A-hole ranting on about nothing, just walk by and you will know exactly what I mean.  The only place like it is Gladstone's in terminal 3 of LAX.  I don't know what in hell it is but it's definitely not appealing.  The Sushi bar in the middle of the terminal is ten times better and doesn't smell like wet crap."}
{"text":"Don't eat at the bar. Worst service ever. Maybe the restaurant is better. But the bar is the worst."}
{"text":"My all time favorite burger spot to go to with my friends. I take anybody with me here if they're craving a good burger or chicken sandwhich. The proportion is always a plus and the staff is always on it to see if you need anything.   I love the ability to create your own burger. They also have it for the salad but come on we're here for the burgers. Always so consistent and would recommend anyone to go here."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed this place very much. Angel was a great waitress and also very helpful with it being our first time. I have no complaints, but there is a lot \"right\" with this place.   -Make your own burger is done by provided pencil and paper.. it really sucks making your own burger at other places trying to tell the sever what all you want..doing it by paper personally just makes my experience so much easier.  -Also to hit on the \"make your own burger\" feature.. This was probably the most options I've ever experienced so that's a big plus. (buffalo & turkey is an option as well)  -Service was great, also would like to point out that me and my wife were a little worried this place was going to be like some of the other restaurants in the area where the staff is half dressed on a good day. Those niche eateries makes us a little uncomfortable to be honest, so we were relieved to find this place is nothing of sorts. This place is more professional, in fact there was an outside company interview lunch going on in the booth behind us. (we were totally not dropping ease but I'd hire him)  -Food was great and well proportioned, also we got one medium well and one well burger, both cooked perfectly to standard. It wasn't greasy at all, I swear some places cook your beef in butter to make it appear juicy.. my burger today, the juice came from the inside and that's just how I like it.  -Diet coke and Diet Dr.Pepper, few places offer D.DP. Big + for me, and I can't be the only one out there. Also big cups!  -Seating, atmosphere, staff,  and cleanliness all exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"This place is NOISY.  Big, high ceiling, hard floors and walls...it's like a school cafeteria. The food is great, though.  Their burgers are great, the sweet potato fries are excellent, and they gave me a to-go cup for my Diet Coke...a big plus!"}
{"text":"This kills me - I absolutely LOVE the burgers at Bad Daddy's.  They are the best I've found in NC.  However, I will caution anyone to drive the extra distance to go to the location on East Blvd. (Dilworth), rather than going to the Ballantyne location.   During my last visit, I received a burger that was over-well-done, when I asked for medium.  They replaced it with a burger that was cooked correctly, but with the wrong cheese on it. They did me right and comped the burger, plus they gave me a coupon for a free appetizer.  The manager was very nice and understanding, and he admitted that their kitchen sucks.   Bad Daddy's is still my burger place of choice; I'll just have to drive 12 miles, rather than 1.5, to have one.  11/11/12 - UPDATE - I decided to give this location another try, rather than drive 12 miles.  Big mistake.  The food took FOREVER to arrive, and when it did, they screwed up my order.  Plus, they overcooked my girlfriend's burger.  The waitress was a bitch, too.  Very unpleasant experience.  The manager is a nice guy, and he walks around the restaurant, apologizing to everyone for the awful service all day.  I can't believe they don't make improvements to the mess they have there.  Never going back.  I mean it this time."}
{"text":"Not really very impressed. By nature, airports offer incredibly expensive food and drinks, so I wasn't necessarily surprised by the cost--but I guess I expected it to be better given the crowd that was inside.   I can't remember what it was called, but I ordered a burger with jalapeno bacon and pepperjack cheese, and it would have been tastier if the bottom bun wasn't soaked with grease and terribly soggy. My order of french fries were 60% french fries, and 40% tater tots. Lazy cook!   For two burgers, it was more than $32.00. I guess they're not at risk of going anywhere anytime soon though because that's kind of the standard in an airport. In the real world, I don't think the novelty environment would allow them to survive beyond the quality of the food. Again, wasn't awful, but the few things they blew it with were just enough to kill the overall experience for us. Could be much better with just a little bit more attention to detail!"}
{"text":"So... Is this place called BIG Daddy's Burger Bar or BAD Daddy's Burger Bar?  I'm corn-fused.  But either way, the burgers are BIG and they are not BAD.  Great, in fact.  Met a co-worker here for lunch, and it was awesome.  I had this portobello mushroom burger that was beer battered and deep fried, and if I could have married it, I would have.  I've eaten many a mushroom in my day, but never one that big, meaty, and delicious (and deep frying, of course, is a surefire way to take any vegetable to the next level).  Fries were crispy and delicious, and the service was pretty great, too.  Tends to fill up pretty quickly at lunchtime (as most restaurants on East tend to do), and the parking is minimal, so if you go at 11:30, it's the perfect time.  I wish I could come here more.  Like, a lot more.  I'll burger it up like woah.  Lunch date anyone?"}
{"text":"Good, burger was a little cold and beer cost too much, I know it's the airport but come on"}
{"text":"Pro tip: if you're hungry, order Emilio's chicken sandwich. It is HUGE. And packed with calories. Albeit delicious ones. The jalapeño bacon adds a nice kick, but the chicken patty was a little too dry. It was also very thick so there could have been more flavor overall. I ate half and saved the rest for dinner.   Another pro tip: onion rings aren't listed as a side on the menu, but they are a side. 10/10 would recommend.  Service is consistently friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This was probably my second or third time to the restaurant - we came here after receiving poor customer service at Brixx (next door). The service couldn't have been any better, the young boy who served us with extremely friendly and proficient.  We had a dog with us who he gave a bowl of water to drink from a peace of bacon to chop on.  The burgers are delicious - the Sam I Am was amazing, I definitely recommend it, and will return!"}
{"text":"As I sit at the front counter enjoying my view of the men's room and sipping my fantastically overpriced glass of Room temperature red wine, using the Tropic of Capricorn for the room temperature standard I woefully bat my eyes at multiple waitrons hoping one will take pity and  humor me by taking my order. Now granted I'm shoved into a corner like Baby would have never accepted but I'm desperately hungry and pickings are slim in terminal C. Thinking 45 min is plenty of time to order a burger and choke it down before I fly away was a pipe dream of gargantuan proportions. My up charged ($5) Kobe burger alas was boxed for cold consumption aloft to the chagrin of my seat mates. But they wouldn't box my million dollar hot grape juice to complete the awesome take away adventure."}
{"text":"The burgers were good and I really liked their tater tots, but the lack customer service and enthusiasm from the server will make me not want to come back here. When I go to a restaurant, I like to feel welcomed and I want to feel like the server is happy to serve me. I don't want to feel like I'm just a way for the server to make good a tip and that's it. If the server wants a good tip, they have to work for it and not in a way that's rushed or rude. It's also nice when you are sat down at a table and the table is clean. That was not the case. The table was sticky and their was still remnants of food from the last guest that sat there. I just felt like all the workers that I observed there didn't seem like they wanted to be there."}
{"text":"The wait time was quite long on Saturday. I really like the burger with mushroom sauce, tasted really good. The one with the chilly however, tasted weird to me, just a personal preference nothing wrong with the food in particular. We had salad and fruit for side. I didn't give 5 stars because of the fruit and how it was served, looked like it wasn't properly washed!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed after my last visit.  I didn't realize that my sandwich came with ketchup on it. When it came out there was half a bottle on it and I hate ketchup. I asked for a new top bun and bacon. I pulled the cheese from the burger and removed the pickle so that I would not need an entirely different new sandwich.  The server claimed that he would have the kitchen make a new top bun and bacon. After about five minutes, he brings out the same bun. How do I know that it was the same bun? Well it was cold this time and had ketchup and mustard smeared on it. Smeared  because they just wiped it off.  Disappointed and done with Bad Daddy's. They weren't even busy, it was before 5pm. Just lazy."}
{"text":"I am officially 5 lbs heavier than I was 2 hours before dinner here.   APPS: We started with the Bacon Cheesebuger Mac n Cheese. Seriously - this is THE BEST mac n cheese I've ever had. Perfectly cheesy, creamy, and chock full of burger patties and crispy bacon pieces.   The fried pickles were interesting, and served with a side of ranch. Don't think I would get these next time since it was 85% fat and oil, and 15% pickle. No points deducted because everything on the menu that is any good has a comparable nutrition value.  BURGERS: Sam I Am - AMAZING. Added mushrooms and avocado and it was perfect. So perfect I didn't even dip into the spicy sauce it came with. I chose the tater tots as my side, meh... TOO SALTY. Other options include salads.  DESSERTS: Desserts were pretty unimpressive. I settled with the banana pudding for lack of better options (instead of the brownie with fudge and ice cream, apple cobbler, or milkshakes). $5 gets you a heaping portion of whipped cream, a couple chopped bananas, and a generous drizzle of caramel. Not bad, but far too rich and not banana-y or pudding-y enough.  The wait was about 20 minutes at 8:15pm which I find odd in Charlotte, but the waitress was friendly and the food came out pretty quick. There are cool milkshake options you can order with alcohol, beer samples, and about 10 different types of bottled beer (yum, they have Rogue!). There's alfresco seating, but the patio was full so we sat by a huge flat screen TV, perfect for all you sports fans. The waitress also split our extremely complex bill in many complex ways without any complaints. Plus, the owner came out to make sure everything was good! Extra points for that.  The only downfall is that I need to detox for 5 days now :("}
{"text":"This is a split review, in a way. I've eaten at Bad Daddy's at least ten times, and now I'm ready to review it.   This location is perfect. While Birkdale Village struggles with parking on a busy night, I've always found a spot with enough persistence. It's very convenient if you're looking for a good meal during your shopping trips or before a movie! My favorite is making this a date morning.   The price point is great. They've got a great variety of items on the menu for a burger joint, and the creativity doesn't disappoint! I would say for two people having a meal that is filling, $30 is very reasonable! (Two entrees, two drinks.) BONUS: breakfast is even more reasonable on prices! Did I mention they have specials every day of the week? $5 mimosas and bloody mary on Sat./Sun. (caution, they don't start serving those as soon as they open.)   The food is what you're curious about, right? I can't really say that I'm your burger specialist because I'm downright picky. Too thin, bleh, too thick, eh. Bad Daddy's is what I call just right. They are right on the money. My only gripe is that I have a hard time getting the whole thing in my mouth, but seriously, that's not a problem. They load the burger with a creative assortment of toppings (my favorite: Bad Ass Burger, true to its name!)   My favorite meal, however, is NOT a burger. It's their breakfast (say, what?! {in your best 80s voice, please})  I'm a huge fan of breakfast, and there are so few GOOD spots in Lake Norman for breakfast. This is one of those sneaky good places. Everything is under $10 (unless you're trying to be #extra and adding sides of jalapeño bacon that's super delish...do it, I dare you.) My two favorites are their That's Bananas (French toast, bananas, and caramel...say no more!) and also their Biscuits and Gravy which is my go-to comfort food breakfast. Fun fact: I exercise early Sunday mornings, so I need protein in the form of Bad Daddy's biscuits and gravy. They load up theirs Biscuits and Gravy with eggs made to order and a sausage patty. I won't stop recommending this place until someone outdoes this dish at this price point. They are total bad boys in regards to breakfast. They are doing it right! They also have a build your own omelet that is historically huge and cooked to perfection.   Their drink selection is also great. I appreciate the local selection of beer they carry (a must in the Lake Norman area with all the microbreweries around.) The coffee they serve at breakfast is also smooth and medium roast.   So my suggestion? Sure, try a burger. It's going to be great, but don't miss breakfast! You're going to love this place in the morning and the evening!   Pro tip: breakfast is only served on Saturdays and Sundays.   Service is always quick.   Constructive criticism: this restaurant smells really bad. I can't put my finger on it, but I think of old onion mixed with cleaning product and grease. It's a smell you get used to after sitting there long enough, but it's awful to walk into. In need of a deep clean?"}
{"text":"Went to Bad Daddy's at the suggestion of a co-worker.  Had the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steriods.  Loved it!  The sweet potato fries were great.  we also had the fried pickles and they were great also.  I was amazed, we went at dinner time of a friday and were seated almost immediately.  The wait staff was outstanding.  The noise level was really high, but in such a small place, not sure how it could be different.  I will go back and at the suggestion of my waitress I am going to have the Bad Ass Burger next."}
{"text":"Omg this place is sooooo good! Lots of flavored bacon choices. I like the buttermilk fried bacon and the jalapeño bacon. Several special sauces to top off your burger. Burgers are made to order and amazing! Only bad thing, there's always a wait. But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Love Big Daddy's!  The best burgers in town, awesome sweet potato fries and an extensive selection of great draft beers.  If you have not been, go check it out."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger on steroids with pimento cheese and on Texas toast was everything I expected. I didn't even touch my tater tots because I was so full afterwards."}
{"text":"Love it any day outside of Friday..... It's just too crazy busy and therefore slow to be worthwhile on Fridays. However, any other day of the week is great!! Hands down the best salads in south Charlotte (who knew)? Get the banana pudding for dessert!!! Waitstaff is always attentive (again, outside of Fridays) and thoughtful for those with small children. A family favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"the bacon cheeseburger on steroids was great... but it was too much.  it kicked my butt.  didn't finish the burger.  tasty food, but unhealthy.  great atmostphere."}
{"text":"We waited for over 30 minutes for our food.  This restaurant is on an airport we just made boarding. The buzzers do not work when you need service or to cancel order.  Waitress are not enough for this Venue.   I will never go here again.   My sweet fries were burnt.   Chicken sandwich was very good.  Waitress was polite. Yes was like water with lemon.  Tables and floor weee sticky."}
{"text":"Incredible burger! Great service. All around great experience.  Went here with a large group and we had a whole side room to ourselves.  I got the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids - which had 2 different types of different bacon (3 strips each) on a big beefy burger. So good! They also gave a big portion of sweet potato fries (and didn't even have an upcharge)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner because I was craving a good burger. He kept raving about this place so I thought I'd give it a try. The burger was delicious. Of course I had to make my own burger. I order a burger with applewood smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions on a brioche bun and a side of fries. I must say for all that I ordered, I was completely satisfied. I didn't feel overly full! This will definitely be in the rotation when I'm craving  good burger.   Very fun atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"This was actually my second visit here.  The service is quick, which is always nice when dining before a flight.  This place just seems to function well.  There is a host(ess) outside ready to seat you.  The waiters are on top of things.  I was greeted  as soon as I sat down, my order was taken and I was checked in on frequently.     There aren't many televisions here, but they do have a few.  They offer traditional seating, bar seating, and store front carry out.  There is a separate area out front to order items to go.  The menu is pretty decent.  They offer typical appetizers,  an array of hamburgers, salads and more.  What really caught my eye was that you can sub out your meat.  I had a bbq burger and subbed in grilled chicken. It was great! I splurged for a side of tots and was not disappointed.  It came with a sweet/tangy dipping sauce that I couldn't seem to put down.    If you're in the C terminal and have the time I recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"This was the best burger ever! I had the American with cheese. ..very juicy and fresh..next up...the Pittsburger...ummm"}
{"text":"I really loved the burger at Big Daddy's, Maybe it is because they have a Gluten-Free menu and I was able to eat at this establishment like a normal human being. I had a jalapeno bacon cheese burger, chips, and pimento cheese dip. It was excelllent. They also had a GF hamburger bun which fell apart but, was tasty. It was really crowded on a Sat. afternoon and has outdoor tables."}
{"text":"This was my first time but not the last. Everything was good here. I mean from the sweet tea to the coleslaw and not to mention the appetizers of onion rings with the dipping sauce. FABULOUS.  I didn't want to share. My burger came out. Mammoth style. Wow. Ok ok ok. Yes very very good but will be back for burger bar. Dessert was banna pudding. We are taking that home cause my belly full and to eat that which looks great requires slippers warm pjs and tv remote control near by."}
{"text":"In keeping with a new tradition of trying a new restaurant every week, we gave this place a try. First impressions were very positive. We opted for an early lunch and doors were open promptly at 11:00. We were the second family to arrive. We were seated next to the window of our choice. We were given prompt and courteous service. Our server was very helpful in providing us detailed information about the meal choices, and she even gave us a brewery recommendation which paired perfectly with my buffalo burger.   The hamburgers were cooked flawlessly -- perfectly cooked. The home made sweet potato fries were to die for. Lunch was satisfying with no complaints whatsoever. Our server was attentive and responsive when we asked other questions after ordering. By the time we finished our meal, the place was packed -- a sure sign that the area loves this place and I can see why. This is now our \"go to\" place when we want a tasty burger.  No complaints about this place at all. It is the way all restaurants should be -- fresh, clean and an attentive staff and fair prices. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is one of my favorite spots.  I was so excited when I found out they were opening one in Concord. I would drive to Birkdale frequently just for Bad Daddy's. I usually get the same thing every time I go and have never been disappointed.   I typically order the \"build your own\" salad and add the bison burger.  The bison burger is a little extra but is delicious and a healthier, leaner option for meat lovers. I typically get the small salad and it's the perfect portion. I never leave there feeling too full.    For an appetizer we ordered the housemade potato chips that comes with french onion dip or pimento cheese.  You can get both if you ask.  The chips are awesome--with just the right amount of crunch.  No matter what night of the week we go to Bad Daddy's, there is a wait. It is smaller restaurant but definitely worth the wait time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I been to Big Daddy's for burgers, but we really love them for their breakfast, which is more low key.  They are one of the few restaurants serving breakfast on both Saturday and Sunday, and they are always packed when we go.    Their coffee is good and strong, and there are enough options on the menu to please everyone.  We have tried the breakfast wrap, sausage biscuits, pancakes, and skillets, but the wrap remains our favorite.  They have a new chef as of early 2011 and the wrap is even better now -- the black bean cake is crispier, the sausage is now crumbled, and the salsa is tastier.  Try the grits as a side with added cheese - it's absolutely yummy!    Their service is also really good - attentive and pretty quick.  I love the outdoor patio when the weather is warm, too.  Big Daddy's is a great value and I highly recommend you give them a try for breakfast."}
{"text":"My hubby and I frequented the Dilworth location until this one opened, and the food is just as good!  Hurray!    Bad Daddy's is one of our favorites for breakfast.  The wrap is delicious and big enough to share.  Their coffee is nice and strong.  They also have pancakes, sausage biscuits and gravy (with eggs!), several scrambles, and make-your-own omelets.  My only beef about breakfast is that the servers almost always forget to give you a spoon to stir your coffee.  It's annoying to have to continue to ask for this!   Bad Daddy's is also good place for a casual dinner.  We love their burger options, but the buns often fall apart before you are done eating.  My favorite is the Cantina burger, with a beef patty instead of black bean.  (But the black bean one falls apart way too easily.)  My hubby loves the Emilio's Chicken Sandwich, loaded with mozzarella, avocados, and jalapeño bacon.  Their tots and onion straws are awesome sides.    Their make-your-own salads are uniquely different and satisfy this gal who doesn't usually like salads.  You choose your lettuce, four sides (there are lots of options, including avocado, black beans, and corn--cut from a cob!), cheese, fruit, and crunch.  You can add a protein at additional cost.  Their dressings are fresh and delicious, and my favorites are avocado ranch and chipotle ranch.  The salads are loaded with your selections and a great value!  Service is usually attentive, and everyone is very friendly.  You may have to wait a bit during the dinner rush, but our wait has never been too long.    They added tables outside and they are popular seating for both breakfast and dinner.  We especially enjoy sitting outside where we can hear the weekend music.    We are excited Bad Daddy's has finally come to Birkdale!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burger places I have ever eaten at and the service was super ! The buffalo was the best I've had, even compared to Colorado."}
{"text":"Wow. Really. Wow. So happy I came here. It was a busy Saturday night and the hosts went out of their way to find us a table. In fact, our server was so slammed when we were sat that the host even came by to get us started. Service here was phenomenal. I was genuinely impressed. I had the almond milkshake to start. It was better than I had hoped. Thick and flavorful. For being a busy night, I was happy the shake came out so fast. Since spending the day hoping from place to place sampling local restaurants, we were starting to get full. We shared the bad ass burger and tots. This burger has bacon ground in with the beef as well as fried bacon on top. Although indulgent....wow was it good. The tots were perfectly cooked and crispy. I would have eaten more of them, but someone had a heavy hand in the salt. Next time I'm in Charlotte, I want to come back here. Perfect service, amazing food. The only downfall was the added salt. A bacon burger doesn't need added salt and the tots were crunchy with extra salt. Maybe its a southern thing...."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here, but the service is consistently horrible. I ordered the Catalina 1511 burger which was very good, except it was ice cold when they brought it too me. Every time I eat here, even when ordering regular beef type burgers, it is cold when it arrives. The flavor of the food is great, but service is usually bad, and was so on this occasion."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly, sweet Southern service despite being in a crazy busy airport with burgers worth sinking your teeth into!  Definitely a solid 3.5/5 in my book.  Even though it's not the best or most gourmet burger you'll ever have, it's definitely better than any fast food you'll find anywhere, let alone any burger you'll find in an airport.  There's a bunch of options on the menu for everyone's different tastes, and honestly even if you don't like any of them, the menu also has a section where you can make your own custom burger from a list of something like 30 different ingredients.  Thoughtful for even the pickiest of eaters!  If you're worried about time - I'd say it's probably nothing worth fretting over.  My friend and I were easily out within 45 mins from sitting down and placing our order to finishing our last bites and paying the bill.  The staff clearly seem to know sometimes there can be a bit of a rush, so they're happy to hurry you out when you need to run to catch your plane, but at the same time, they're happy to let you take your time as well if you have a longer wait or layover.  Overall, a really solid establishment.  I would definitely be back if only for the thoughtfulness of the staff that work there!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers that you customize exactly how you want! They also have turkey burgers and chicken sandwiches. The sweet potato fries and homestyle potato chips are awesome. Great salad choices too. Fun, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming back again. Another round of horrible service (server forgot half my order), and the food is on par with a McDonalds."}
{"text":"The service really takes forever. It was such a long process to get 4 burgers and no appetizers. It was delicious and maybe I'll give it a shot on a week day."}
{"text":"Great place to get an original burger with fries before, after, or in between flights."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! First, the fried pickles are delicious (how could you go wrong?!?!!). Second, I had the Cantina burger and it was fantastic! The atmosphere is loud, but the music is great. Have fun here!"}
{"text":"We come several times and I like it less and less. Last time we got fried pickles and super salty and not even crispy. Did get wings and they were good but not crispy like ordered. Did a build your own which the burgers are huge but nothing special. The best thing they have is alcoholic shakes. Overall just average bar food."}
{"text":"I got the \"Pittsburgher\" and it was sooooo yummy...probably because of its name ;-) lol. Go steelers! The french fries are delicious, as well! Definitely will be returning here very soon!"}
{"text":"Great burgers. Try the Western burger! Don't let the fact that it's buffalo meat scare you. It's better than beef in every way!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It's got the atmosphere I like as well as a menu I like.  It's my type of place.    Truth is, service was good, the food was decent, and I wasn't unhappy here.    But the burger was a bit of a letdown.  And the reason was that they served it on a shriveled and wrinkled roll, which actually made the roll taste rather stale.  (Picture is on Yelp for the record)  But the rest of the food was good.  That burger would have been pretty good had it been served properly.  And I loved the tater tots with the dipping sauce.    I saw other burgers served that had better rolls.  I don't know why the kitchen chose to give me the runt of the litter.  That's the way it goes I guess.    If I was in the airport again, I'd give them another chance to make up for it.  But it is what it is."}
{"text":"Don't really get the hype about this place. Tried it out for the first time after hearing such good reviews about it and my bf and I were both disappointed. We both agree that the burgers tasted pretty bland. Not out of this world like some of the reviewers make it out to be. The tater tots were the best part of our entire meal. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We visited on Thursday night of last week. It was easy to get a seat. The service was good as well.  Now the food....I had a Dragonberry drink. IT was to DIE FOR! It was very fruity and fresh, and loaded with fresh strawberries. We then had the wings. They were good as well. But by far, the winner of the night was my burger which came with a fried egg, ham, and  cheese. I'd heard about burgers with eggs before, but finally tried it and was impressed!  We would definitely go back. A must if you love burgers!"}
{"text":"Some good points, some not-so-good, it all adds up to \"OK\"  First of all, enough has been said about the parking so I won't dwell on it.  Go early and avoid the rush, unless you drive a SmartCar.  The service was really good.  This was our second time at BD and the service has been great both times, attentive without being overbearing.  Our waiter obviously knew the menu and answered all our questions.    The food was definitely hit or miss. As one would expect, the burger was the star of the show.  Fresh ground from a blend of chuck, hanger steak, and brisket, it tasted fresh, clean, flavorful and had just the right amount of fat.  Both of ours were cooked perfectly. The bun was good and they have a nice array of toppings.  I had the southern burger with slaw and chili.  The chili was nice and fresh with a nice, almost too much, spiciness.  The sides disappointed.  Fries were very hot but limp.  This is always a problem with fresh cut, cooked once, fries.  We asked that ours be refried to crisp them up but they just brought us another order.  If you want great, piping hot, crisp fries, go somewhere else that knows how to do the blanch and then crisp, two fry method. Tater tots were tasty but cool to the touch upon arriving at our table. The lettuce was a little limp, but the pickle was really good and I liked the Bad Daddy sauce but it was a little too spicy for the wife.  No room for dessert but I have heard good things.  Its a good place to go to hang out and have a burger but for me, more of a spur-of-the-moment place than an actual destination."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a very long time. This will definitely be my go to for a burger now! Good choice on beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Shame on you! Bad Daddy's! You tricked me into thinking I ordered a burger!   It was more like a savory French dip!  So delicious! Will have to stop by again if ever in NC:"}
{"text":"Fun!  Hostess Lauren knows what's good; she recommended the Badass Burger; it truly lived up to the name."}
{"text":"Let's see.  The food is good, however the staffing pattern is terrible.  Good luck getting take out.  First they will park you on hold for at least 5 minutes. If you are able to order you are greeted by the awful smell of dish towels that must have been marinating in water that was last changed during desert storm, the first one. Finally, when you pay you will be treated like they are doing you the biggest favor by fulfilling your order.  The food is good but the experience is so bad I doubt I will go back.  Burger places are a dime a dozen.    Four stars on the food and one star on the service."}
{"text":"Been eating at bad daddy's for many years and was so happy to see them in Concord.  Had the Sam I am burger and tater tots. The burger did not disappoint. Although it's very messy, the mess is well worth every bite. The fried pickle appetizer is also to die for. Thanks for opening in Concord I will see you soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my top three favorite airport stops and I travel a lot. The service has always been exceptional and the food is very good. Prices are reasonable for an airport.   It's not often that I look forward to eating in an airport, and I've eaten many 3 Musketeers or Chex Mix dinners, but I make sure I have time to eat here when I'm in CLT."}
{"text":"We could eat here weekly.  The food is fresh, delicious, the staff is attentive, and the prices are reasonable.  If you are living the Keto lifestyle, they do offer their burgers on lettuce wraps, and you can also sub a side salad where you customize all the ingredients.  The bacon mayo is amazing, as is their house made American cheese. I've tried many of their burgers, and really can't pick one favorite. They are all great.  They have a great craft beer selection. The mixed drinks are also great, but small portion for the price you pay. Stick with beer.  The Thai chili wings are amazing.  It gets packed here, so it is best to eat early, or late in the day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a burger in Charlotte.  The have a Bison burger with real Bison meat and leaner than chicken!  It is my current favorite.  Their fries are great too.  If we have family in from out of town we try to take them here at least once.    Only reason for not having 5 stars is parking, sometimes you can literally walk a mile to get there and the people that do park in their parking lot are sometimes so rude they will block you in without a thought.  Hasn't happened to me but I have seen it happen at lunch time."}
{"text":"Best ever burgers i have ever had. Delicious, juicy all the way till the last bite. The burgers are huge and you probably might skip the next meal :-) We were a party of 2 and tried out the \"Bad Ass burger \" and the \"Smokehouse special burger\" .  This place is a must try if you are around."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  There is a huge array of burgers to choose from as well as a build your own option-this goes for salad as well.  They have delicious fries, and tater tots to choose from.  They also have spiked milkshakes which are so good!  You definitely have to try them at least once.  The restaurant is somewhat small, but they do have outdoor seating.  I have never gone when there wasn't some kind of wait.  The service is generally fast after you place your order.  It always seems to be extremely loud inside, so if intimate is what you're wanting-this is not the place.  The staff is helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. The sliders were a perfect appetizer. Very nice bartender: he was very friendly, outgoing, and helpful! Would come back because of great service!"}
{"text":"Great service & Great food. My family and I loved every bite of our food. There was a small wait to be seated but it was worth it. Our waitress was very attentive. The burgers were outstanding and so were the tator tots. My daughter ordered a black bean burger and loved it. We will definetly return soon."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Burgers were juicy and flavorful. House made chips were OK but our favorites were the tots. We liked it so much that we're heading there again soon."}
{"text":"Glad I choose this place to spend time awaiting a connecting flight. The detour was welcoming and food was good. That's all that is needed when traveling."}
{"text":"Great burger place with tons of options! I have to eat grass fed burgers because of my food allergies and Big Daddy's Burger Bar offers a local NC grass fed burger. They also have a gluten free bun (without soy or milk) so I am in heaven."}
{"text":"Visited Charlotte for 24 Hours Of Booty and was recommended by a friend to go here. AWESOME place. We had fried pickles and local beers to start and it started the night off the right way. My friend got the Mama Ricotta Burger, which I am told pays homage to another one of their eateries, and I got the special: a Chimichurri burger with pepper jack, tomatoes, grilled onions, and I added bacon aioli. AMAZING!  If you are visiting Charlotte, make this one of your stops."}
{"text":"Stay clear of this place, there are better ways to waste your money. Seated at the counter, four different parties, the food was terrible and the staff did nothing to make it right."}
{"text":"For an airport joint... its pretty good. I can't comment on service and I just grabbed a burger to go. Had the Cheeseburger on steroids. So much bacon! Yum! I even walked 15 minutes to this place as it was in Concourse C. Would definitely pick this place over the seafood place across.  Prices are of course above average since its in the airport but for the price you pay at the airport the burger was pretty good. Came with a side as well which I picked sweet potato fries. The fries weren't that good and over fried but meh. Burger was good!"}
{"text":"I would have to say that Big Daddy's is one of my favorite burger places in Charlotte. The food is very good quality and always cooked to perfection. I have eaten here dozens of times and have not once had a dry or tasteless meal.   The menu itself has a variety of burgers to choose from including the southerner burger which has coleslaw and chili (my current favorite), and the Mama Ricotta's burger which is a true tribute to the restaurant that it was named after. That said, my true favorite (the burger with Guinness beer battered onion rings) was taken off of the menu. *sniff, sniff* You are missed dear burger!   The menu does have an assortment of chopped salads for all those meatless types, and there is a pretty decent beer selection too to wash everything down. Although, I have yet to find a beer that goes well with salad.   One thing to keep in mind when you go here... if you are going on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, or any other time when people eat, be prepared to wait a little while. This place is always hopping!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure how I feel about Bad Daddy's. We went with a group of six on a Saturday and had to wait about 20 minutes which wasn't bad. We were seated in the tented and heated area outside when it was about 20 degrees outside and we still had to keep winter coats on the entire time. Our service wasn't amazing, it was crowded but our waiter was on the slow side. The food was good but wasn't amazing either. They make a good burger but there are places in Charlotte that make better. They do have some unique burgers though. Not my favorite place but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Favorite burgers in town. I highly recommend the Sam I Am (add bacon!) great ambiance, good prices, great service. Can get really busy- so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, but our food was so horrible. Appetizer burnt, tator tots were so soggy and greasy. Super disappointed !! Will not be returning ."}
{"text":"I'm in between 3 and 4 stars. The burgers and other food is consistently good, but the bathrooms...they need a lot of loving. Like to the point of \"wait until you get home\" loving, and the parking lot. It's tight and tricky.   The food- the burgers are thick and juicy. There are some on the menu that come pre-arranged, or you can make your own. The problem with make your own is that it gets pricy quickly. You're better off finding a pre-made toppings one. I love their make your own salad though, any 7 toppings so you can make the salad of your dreams. Yes, at a burger place. You can't go wrong with their tater tots. Always crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside."}
{"text":"I should've taken a pic but I ate it too quickly  I ordered the Kobe burger on special and it was awesome, the only issue is I could've eaten more. Meat was a perfect medium rare per my request  Side of fries was good as well  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. We sat at the bar and the service was awesome. All of the bartenders were super attentive and made sure we were taken care of at all times. Unlike other people we came Bad Daddy's knowing that 1. It is a new restaurant 2. It is was going to be packed 3. IT IS RACE WEEKEND!!!  People seem to forget that a new restaurant needs about 2 weeks to work all the kinks out, especially when opening the week of the coca cola 500. If your expecting speed either wait 2 weeks or go find a drive thru.   We will be back. All of the food was awesome and correct and the staff was great."}
{"text":"On our way back to Philly from Michigan, the GF and I had a layover at Charlotte Douglas International in North Carolina. We were also in the mood for burgers so decided to check out Bad Daddy's Burger Bar.  Cookies n Cream Spiked Milkshake [$13.49] Vodka, Kahlua, Baileys, Oreo cookies  We decided to share one of the spiked milkshakes, which was a creamy mix of Oreo cookies and Kahlua and Baileys which always goes well together. You could get a faint whiff of the vodka, but the cookies and cream was definitely at the forefront. Not bad at all.  Fried Pickles [$8.29] Sliced dill pickles, lightly breaded, ranch dressing  And if fried pickles are on the menu, it's probably going to be ordered. These were delicious. Briny - almost to a fault - these were deftly fried and rendered crisp. The ranch dressing offered some respite from the salt at first, but to be honest, brought it over the top. But perhaps I was complaining because I knew what was to come for me.   Chicken Club Burger [$10.99]  The GF went with a ground chicken club burger, which came with the addition of ham, bacon, and cheese. The burger itself was moist and well-seasoned. The ham was a bit much, but who can say no to bacon.  Onion Straws Chipotle ranch dipping sauce  She opted for the onion straws, which were delicious, but added to the heavy nature of this particular meal. It came with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce, which again initially tempered the salt and grease, but really brought it over the top.  Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids [$13.49] Burger, 3 pieces of jalapeno bacon, 3 pieces of applewood smoked bacon, Monterey Jack, Baconnaise, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickle   And what exactly was I 'concerned' about? I had to get the bacon cheeseburger on steroids - replete with 6 slices of jalapeno and applewood smoked bacon. Baconnaise added to this calorie bomb, with the grease of the burger and bacon resulting in a soggy bottom bun. And first few bites were delicious, the burger itself was overpowered and even I couldn't finish this. Needless to say, I was drinking lots of water for the rest of the day.  Tater Tots Bad Daddy's sauce  I went with tater tots and couldn't help but enjoy these childhood favorites - crisp on the outside and creamy within, these were on point.   So if you're looking for a light meal during a layover, do not head to Bad Daddy's. But if you're looking to satiate an urge for mounds of bacon and grease, look no further - they've got you covered, and then some."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER IN TOWN!  If you want a juicy burger with awesome toppings then this is the place! You can build your own burger, any sandwich, or salad. The chili is great. But the best side is the truffle french fries...DELISH!"}
{"text":"I really love anything Carolina! But this place has got me hooked the fried pickles are seasoned to perfection! And the variety never leaves you hungry. Try them out!"}
{"text":"I've always appreciated the food quality and taste of Bad Daddy's but now also must say am very pleased with a recent experience with their customer service. Had a previous miscommunication with them during a period when they were closed. Their GM went above and beyond  in their response to rectify the situation.    As a patron I highly recommend the smokehouse, the southern, and the bacon cheeseburger on steroids. My wife loves their frenchie turkey burger option.  We always opt for the sweet potato fries and the sauce they come with!"}
{"text":"Burger joint. The burger was really good, perfectly cooked but missing onions. Chips were pretty good, but the pimiento cheese dip was the star. My drink was really good but low on liquor. Cool place. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Been a long time. Went here for my son's birthday. He wanted to go to a burger joint and he liked the name.   The burger and fries were both very good. The pickle for the burger was good not great (not important to everyone). The service was just okay, but that was just our waiter (long time to get check). The rest of the staff was working very hard, and they were incredibly busy.   Good atmosphere as well. It's not the best or worst place you can go for lunch. Just a good once-in-a-while solid option if you like burgers."}
{"text":"When I knew that I was going to have 2 hours to kill on a layover, Reddit enthusiastically recommended stopping here.  All I can say is meh.  This is a good place for solo travelers as I was seated at a small table near the kitchen.  I got some alright fried pickles for my appetizer that I washed down with a 24 oz can of PBR (only $8, not bad for airport prices).  I didn't enjoy the lack of booze prices on the menu.  I was able to watch the news on a big screen while eating, which was nice.  The burger was average, the fries were bland and they forgot a few ingredients that I had ordered.  The service definitely lacked attention, even with the service buttons on the table.  I might come back here, but eh, depends on which terminal my layover takes me to."}
{"text":"I am giving this 5 stars because it is a very unique place with fresh food. If you are looking for a cool little casual burger joint, this is the place to go. I had the Big Ass Burger... Quite an experience"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Asked to sit outside and they told us there was no servers for outside that day, which was upsetting but still delish nonetheless."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times. Popped in about a week ago and dined in on a date. For a Thursday night, they were busy but we were seated right away. Started with the asparagus appetizer. That was a great choice. We both enjoyed it. I order their signature burger and it was huge. Deep fried bacon! Um, yes please. It was so big I had to take 2 of the pieces of bacon off the burger just to eat it. They should just served the bacon as an appetizer. The tater tots were good as always. Overall we had a great experience. It was made even better when the newest Charlotte Hornet, Frank \"the tank\" Kaminsky, was seated right next to us. Yes, I recognized him right away but I played it cool and said nothing to him. Had to let the man enjoy his burger too!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a handful of times. Overall it's ok. Stopped in last week and tried the buffalo chicken sandwich w/ a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries are always a winner especially w/ the spicy sauce they serve up. The chicken sandwich, not bad. The chicken was tender and had decent spice for a buffalo chicken sandwich but it was served w/ a blue cheese crumble AND ranch dressing. That's a little strange to me. Shouldn't it be an either/or? I asked for the ranch on the side and it worked out well. Again, by no means a bad experience but when I look at just burgers or in this case a buffalo chicken sandwich, I've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"the best ever veg burger ive eaten in charlotte !! the black bean patty.. topped will delicious heavenly toppings... accompanies with fries.. is a anyday mood lifter!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great hamburger place back in the day but my food which I ordered was not a hamburger and was really bad this visit , we were told by the manager that the grill cook was new, but that is not an excuse that I can take seriously being that a high volume establishment like this one should have a well trained kitchen at all times. I don't want to get into specifics because despite the cooks major errors and bad timing, the floor staff gets 5 stars for excellent customer service and based on their excellent behaviors this moves this original 1 star review to 3 stars, (((the cook))) deserves the 1 not the waitress nor the hostess or even the manager. The lesson? Customer service when effectively executed wins over all bad sichs every-time and these people know how to handle these situations, granted my case was unusual but this was a stellar staff and believe it or not I will be returning to review when they least expect it! My advice? Only order their hamburgers, the non hamburger menu can get messy for an untrained kitchen staff..."}
{"text":"One of my first places I went to in Charlotte! I enjoyed my burger (so happy to find a place that temps burgers ie rear, med, well).  My burger was good, sweet potato fries were warm, not hot, but this tends to happen at a lot  of places. Bartender was really friendly and welcoming. He made suggestions and was helpful! I also treated myself to a spiked milkshake (so if I did have a heart attack, I would already be in heaven) soooo goood! I'm not sure what more I would need to make it a 5, maybe because I was comparing to an upscale burger chain Zin Burger (on the west coast )  Ballantyne location"}
{"text":"I went here with some people from work for the first time a few weeks ago and I haven't been able to stop talking about it. I went again yesterday and had an equally great experience. Consistently amazing food. Not your typical burger joint. I love the turkey burger! Try The Frenchie, its a turkey burger with grilled apples. Bad Daddy's has become an absolute favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"This is only about their chili. Worst chili ever. I was so under whelmed that I couldn't wait to write a review. This review is only for the chili. Looked great but that first bite was just terrible. It was so salty but sweet at the same time. It seems like they just opened a can of ketchup, put some beans and meat into it and called it a day.    I had a short stop and just wanted to grab something quick, should've grabbed a sandwich somewhere else instead. The experience of ordering (take out) wasn't great either. Right outside it smelled really foul, like a dirty bathroom but it's not coming from the bathroom. A flight attendant walked by and was asking her collegue \"Why does it always smell so bad here?\"   There are many more options and they all cost about the same. Next time I'll know to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Outstanding burgers, love the tater w/ special sauce, awesome milk shakes, and great service. Used to only go to the Dilworth location for special occasions, but now that it's in Huntersville, will definitely be frequenting the joint more often!"}
{"text":"God I love these burgers.  No really I have been around and this one of two awesome places that I would recommend to friends. The have a great choices of burgers all are very flavorful, and I would come back here everyday if I could.  So a sticking point for me on a 5 star review for a burger place is that the place MUST cook the burger the way you want it, med rare, med, med well .....  These do exactly that! If I ask for a med burger and it come out well I'm not going to give a good review.  These burgers have creativity in them and they are all worth a try.   Oh yea, they are also pet friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a recent Saturday for lunch and really enjoyed our experience. We've been to the one in Dilworth but this was our first time at this location. I am cool with both places.   My boyfriend ordered some burger that's like bacon on top of bacon with more bacon. I am one of the few people in this world who isn't over the moon about bacon. I mean, I like it but it doesn't blow my mind. Anywaysssss, he loved the burger. He had a side of chips that he really liked. They were a bit over cooked for my liking but good nonetheless.   I had the pittsburgher with pimento cheese instead of American cheese and no ketchup. It was really good. The fries on it aren't really fries but more like potato sticks. They gave a good crunch though so I was digging it. The tater tots were also quite delicious.   Overall, we really enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"I booked a red eye connecting flight , I had been up since 3am, and by the time I landed in Charlotte, it was 9am and my circadian rhythms were telling me it was lunch and I wanted chicken wings.  Minutes prior to connection: 28 minutes- I was starving, went to Big Daddy's and told the waitress about my morning chicken wing fixation, and she told me that she would check with her manager since wings aren't normally on the breakfast menu.  27 minutes- she came back and sweetly told me that the buffalo sauce wasn't prepared, but they would be happy to prepare naked wings with hot sauce on the side. Go for it, and by the way, my flight is boarding in 13 minutes.  23 minutes- naked wings no hot sauce. oops, says waitress, they forgot hot sauce! 22 minutes- hot sauce appears, can I have the check? 21 minutes- check in hand, here's my credit card. Were the wings good? Yes, thanks (medium size, piping hot, well seasoned, crispy) 20 minutes- here's the receipt, thanks for stopping by. No, thank you for accommodating me! Scribble tip and signature and run to my gate, which is boarding. Wow, she even gave some wetnaps for the road! 17 minutes- at gate, boarding, I have 30 seconds to wash my hands and not make my neighbor hungry 15 minutes- I'm the last straggler at the gate, door closes. Nap ensues from food coma.  And that, my friend, is how waitresses earn a 50%+ tip."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken sandwich grilled and tater tots. Wait staff was great. The manager came around to check. The tater tots are crispy and the house sauce is spicy and smokey"}
{"text":"We've been here 4-5 times, and it is just so good. My favorite is the Magic Mushroom burger with house fries. It's probably the best burger I've ever had.   This is also the second time I've had their house margarita, which is also very yummy!!  The waitstaff is always so nice and attentive. We love this place."}
{"text":"Kudos to the employee who ran out in the torrential downpour to lower the outdoor patio covering. Not only did you bathe in the rain as comedic entertainment for the patrons, but you spared my food from getting wet.   Came here to grab a quick bite because we didn't know where else to go. I ordered the standard burger medium well, with the addition of cheddar and grilled onions, and it was cooked just as requested. Great burger, full of flavor, and the 6 oz. portion was plenty especially with the large side it comes with. I got it with tater tots, which were a bit on the salty side, but crispy golden brown and didn't fall apart. Fries were also good."}
{"text":"Meh is about accurate, at least for breakfast. I had about an hour in the airport during an early morning layover and strolled the concourse a bit trying to decide where to have a quick breakfast.  Best I can say is that for $13 for just a meh omelette and some under ripened fruit, next time I'm passing through Charlotte in the AM I will try another place.  I have to eat gluten free, so that left me with an omelette & a side of fruit to choose from.  Keep this in mind if you have to be GF. I do have to offer this location a special thanks for the comedy I was able to enjoy during my quick meal.  The couple next to me was hilarious to listen to.  The husband was so upset by the way his scrambled eggs were cooked that his wife began to literally slide down in her seat in what I can only assume was an attempt to pretend she could no longer be seen with him.  Was truly priceless.  As for what was wrong with his scrambled eggs (I mean, how can scrambled eggs ever really be wrong?) I have no idea. Summation?  If in the Charlotte airport in the AM, walk around a bit and try a different breakfast sport.  Maybe as the name implies, this place is better for burgers."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's is a place my husband and I frequent, at least once or twice a month. One of our  favorite places! Recommend the Build your own- Brie, grilled onions and mushrooms, applewood smoked bacon, chipotle ranch, amazing!! Husband always gets the truffle fries, YUM!"}
{"text":"Feels like they are just going through the motions in the kitchen...  I've been going to Big/Bad Daddy's for years and have really enjoyed every visit until the last few. Went tonight for a basic cheeseburger and my friend got a cheeseburger with bacon. We both asked for medium rare. Literally within three minutes the burgers were out. I'm not sure mine even touched the grill. The consistency on the inside was that of a patty that hadn't seen any heat at all. I sent it back and was told by the waitress that the next one would get special attention and be right up. This time 15 minutes later it finally arrived. Nothing special and when I took a good luck at it I noticed that the patty was not as big as its been in the past. Manager came over and didn't show much concern about how long it took and at the end of the meal didn't come back to check or take anything off the bill.   Another issue I have is that it is almost guaranteed that the sides are warm at best. Fries, onion straws, onion rings... they must be sitting in the kitchen a long time. When I point this out I'm immediately given a fresh hot side. Why not the first time!  With all of the burger places around its not a good thing that the name bad daddy's is starting to reflect the quality of the food and effort."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day Ofcourse ! Had a great time enjoy the fantastic food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great tasty food!!!!!!  Poor service.  Waiter never came.  The only person who cared about me was Elise.  Restaurant always loses stars on poor service."}
{"text":"My coworker and I went yesterday and it was packed.  Unfortunately for them their power went out and the place cleared out.  We were lucky enough to get our food and not have to be turned away.  I ordered the Texan salad and my colleague ordered the Greek salad.  We split each of our salads so we could have both and WOW.  They were delicious.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is just an average burger spot.  Their beef quality for their burgers isn't as good of a quality as other burger places.   I had a create your own burger with Apple wood bacon and pimento cheese.  The pimento cheese was just okay.  It was like they melted the cheese on the burger, as oppose to having a scoop of thick pimento cheese.   The service here is really good but the food is just mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that they took the shrimp burger off of the regular menu but the bad ass burger was ok..the service was poor and the waitress was unattentive.. I will be back when the shrimp burger comes back..."}
{"text":"Good burgers, great sweet potato fries, very good non beef burgers (veggie and turkey)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the portions were great. Everyone there was pleasant and super accommodating. I went there for breakfast, can't wait to return for lunch and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Burger #190: In Good Company  Thank god I was surrounded by health care professionals when I ate that burger. With a 99% chance of a heart attack, they would have had only a few minutes to prep me for an organ donation after my cardiac death. Lucky for me, that burger didn't kill me and I was able to conquer it.   When out with clients, I typically try not to do anything too \"Eli\" like. But when the menu said \"Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids\" and promised six strips of bacon with bacon salt and baconnaise, I couldn't help myself. Since I was already going to hell for ordering that meaty death on a plate, I upped the ante by adding a fried egg to the gluttonous pile.   Behold; http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yWUBX9Pe6pzh1PjVj04UmQ?select=g17yyWNzeNH8tx3llO2xZQ  It was everything I had hoped for; meaty, rich, baconny, juicy, packed with flavor, and overly sinful. The six strips of bacon all melded together into a rich decadent topping that was only enhanced by the runny egg yolk. The mild jack cheese did its part by adding a smooth texture and another fatty element to the mix. The bun was perfect; unobtrusive and sturdy enough to withstand the burger's might. The only thing keeping the burger from perfection was that it came a tad overcooked, other than that it was great.   The coup de gras (pun intended) were the tater tots. They were some of the best I've ever had. Crisp, salty, and delicious. They were just what I needed to help wash down the insanity that was my burger."}
{"text":"The place was almost closing, we were starving! The manager was kind enough to let them seat us. Never have I ever finished such a huge burger! The sweet potato fries and dipping sauce were killer!! I am so excited that my hometown will now have our own Bad daddy's, so fresh, prepared with care. My group and I were silent during our meal just enjoying each bite!"}
{"text":"Get the Sam I Am with bacon. BEST burger I've ever had and I don't use that phrase generously at all"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to Bad Daddy's Burger Bar for some time now.  Every time I have had an opportunity to go it had been too crowded and ended up going somewhere else.  On this day, I timed it just right and was able to beat the lunch crowd.  Atmosphere - Spacious, Noisy, Casual, Concrete, Corrugated Metal, On the verge of being a big chain feel.  Service - Friendly, Attentive, Communicative, Well trained.  Food - I opted for what's in the title of the restaurant and went with a burger...a basic burger, medium well, w/ grilled onions and a side of tater tots (maybe I am a 12 yr old).  The burger arrived after what started to seem like a long wait.  I noticed others where waiting too as the place was slammed.  Luckily, within minutes of noticing the length of my wait, I turned to see our order arriving.  Let me start of by saying that my side of tater tots was more like a meal.  The portion of tots in the stainless steel bowl was huge!  I would almost say it was enough for two people to enjoy.  Unfortunately, while large in portion these tots were a little dry/ overcooked.  While disappointing, this was okay as it helped to prevent me from eating them all.  The burger looked good at first; however, upon reaching down to assemble it I was greeted with a soggy mess of a bun.  Half of the bottom bun was as wet as could be from, I assume, the grilled onions.  This could have been avoided if the onions were slightly tapped dry or the bun had been of a heartier nature.  I did a little bun surgery and was able to assemble the remnants into a form of a burger.  No ketchup or mustard was added as to avoid any additional moisture to an already fairly damp situation.  I guess I could have asked for a new bun...but...I was limited on time.    The burger tasted okay, as it was cooked as requested.  It was juicy without tasting greasy...but I missed my k&m flavors.  Overall - It was a decent experience and I am willing to give BDBB another try...sans the grilled onions of course."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3 times...and after I had the \"magic mushroom\" burger, there wasn't much of chance I will try something different. The \"magic mushroom\" burger is THE BEST BURGER IN THE WORLD and that's a modest way of saying it lol. Atmosphere is a typical grill/bar with plenty of tvs and actually it's very quiet on major sports nights so keep that in mind. I have never waited to be sat even on Saturday nights and service is excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Everybody loved the food and the price wasn't too bad. There was no wait, and the shakes were awesome!"}
{"text":"Great quality MEAT!!! Well cooked burgers and the tator tots are delicious!!!!  ASK FOR the CHIPOLTE RANCH dressing on the Burger! D E L I C I O U S!!!"}
{"text":"Parking was okay. Establishment looked clean from the outside. Walking in, the hostess was NOT friendly at all. No smile, nothing. My husband and I were going in for take out anyway but still. The bartender was friendlier which was a plus. While waiting for our food I did notice a lot of waitresses serving food with their hair half up half down. Some of them had hair so long it was a turn off to think that their hair would be in someone's food has they handled it and I noticed at least 2-3 of them playing with their hair has they went back and forth or were waiting for their orders. Other than that it was an okay experience. We actually dined in at another location which was SUPERB!  I ordered the all American which was okay. However my husband ordered the Lil' frenchie and the turkey burger tasted like foot. Not sure what was up with that. Maybe because they are new they would need some help but again the experience was a lot better at another location."}
{"text":"Top notch fast service. Stopped in for lunch break was greeted, sat, and served with a quickness. Food was off the hook especially the Bad Daddy's sauce. This was my first experience here and was blown away to the point to leave a review before leaving. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had a \"Build your own burger\" and opted for my tried and true combo of grilled onion (sweet), grilled jalapeno (spicy), mayo (salty,fat), and cheese. It was prepared perfect medium and delicious. So, good food is possible at airports! Service from the dude at the bar was super."}
{"text":"I come here about twice per year. I believe the quality used to be better . The beef is definitely a lot more greasy than before ,although the flavor and size of the burger is still flavorful which is the only reason why I still visit this place. The chicken nachos are a must as well. It gets pretty busy for lunch on Saturdays so make sure you come on early to get a table faster"}
{"text":"This, to me, is what a burger joint should be. I've been numerous times but not nearly as often as I'd like. I was blessed to make the fine decision to get the bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. Whoever invented jalapeño bacon deserves a freakin medal of honor. This burger was perfectly cooked, had a ton of toppings including 6 total slices of bacon and was a little like writing a bear! Along side it was a bowl of fried tater tots with homemade bacon mayo. I cannot stress enough how many not-up-to-par burger places are out there acting like they have something going on. They are wrong. I am right. Every visit has been a delight. Yes, sometimes with the crowd it can be a little of a wait, but it's worth every minute. My wife was thrilled with her mushroom burger and my kid loved her regular sized bacon cheese burger.   This place is a lock! Gonna be good, gonna be happy, gonna have something on your shirt.   That's it and that's all.   Eat well, punks!  Vic"}
{"text":"They charge the same price for Bud Light as for premium beer: expensive.  It's worth a stop if your gate is right next to the place, and you're trying to catch the Lions' game (if you're trying to catch any other game then you're a failure).  For anything else, I recommend reading a book in the waiting area."}
{"text":"Bad ass burger and parm-truffle fries rock! Great draft selections as well. Food came quick and hot. Service was good and the outside patio is great on one of those perfect Spring Charlotte nights.  Definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"What a great burger joint. The tater tots, fried pickles and Parmesan truffle fries were off the hook. All the dips that went with them too. If we lived in the Lake Norman area this would be my go to Sports bar. Loved it."}
{"text":"If you love salt then you'll love this place. Food it covered in salt. My daughter likes going there so last time I went I just asked for no added salt and it was better but still very greasy. Good food doesn't need lots of oil. Last time I was there it made my stomach upset, but it wasn't food poisoning, just super greasy food."}
{"text":"Stuck at the airport I was left no choice but to follow the mass of slow moving sheeple into this place. We were herded around a hostess stand and there we stood until we were fortunate enough to be carelessly taken to seats with little acknowledgement at all. The entire time I referred to it as \"The Harley Davidson lookin place\" for the obvious orange and black garage motif with license plates dripping off the walls. I certainly don't want to be here, and I get the idea that the staff doesn't want to be either. Funny thing is they have a To-Go station. I'm a captive at this point but the service isn't doing it for me so I start contemplating getting a beer from the take-out line and scurrying away to drink in relative peace. There's nowhere else to go! Fine, I'll order some tots, drink the discomfort away, and charge my phone. Ugh, never again please."}
{"text":"Again, Meh pretty much explains it. There is next to no room for waiting and we had about a 30 minute wait the last time we tried this location. It was still really cold outside, so at some point we gave up and packed ourselves inside the tiny area. The tables are also close together. I didn't like having to slide in so close to another person to be seated in the booth for our table. Our service was fine but the food was meh. And I just cannot justify a $35 dinner for two when it is meh. A place that specializes in burgers should have GOOD burgers and these are just not that good."}
{"text":"We have eaten at BDBB 3 or 4 times over the past six months.  It's a little bit of a drive for us, but if we lived closer we would go much more often.    We usually start with the deep fried pickles.  If ordering for just 1 or 2 people be careful to not fill up on these before your burgers arrive as the portion deceiving.  A note on these, the pickles are sliced longwise, they are not \"chips\" or spears.  The breading is nice (instead of a batter) so you don't end up with hot pickle juice buying your mouth!  If I am trying to be healthy I will go for the Turkey Burger and Brie (I call it that - I just cant order the \"Frenchie\" :-)   But most times we throw caution to the wind and get the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids.  Bacon, Bacon and more Bacon...  If I had a complaint about Bad Daddy's it would be the same that I have with nearly every burger joint.  It doesn't matter what temp you order your burger, it will usually be medium well to well done.  We never have room for dessert so I can't tell you anything about it.  Avoid \"peak times\" as there isn't a comfortable place to sit or stand if you have to wait.  I guess prices are subjective.  We were fine with paying $11.50 for a good size burger with Bacon and a side."}
{"text":"Awe man!!! We went in. I had a chicken sandwich with mozzarella cheese and special sauce. My husband had a salad that was out of sight. It looked small but once he began to dig in, the veggies were piled high under the fresh greens and not iceberg greens. The only thing that disappoints me is the onion straws which has a batter that is extremely salty to me. That's why I still have them 5 stars. They traded my onion straws for fresh tator tots and I went to town."}
{"text":"A group of us tried Daddy's Burger Bar for lunch and it was a beautiful Charlotte day so we were able to sit outside! The ambiance of the restaurant is quaint but very comfortable and inviting. That alone would make me come by again in the future on a lunch break. The parking is very minimal though, so be prepared to have to park down the street if you don't snag a one of the few lot-spots.   We got home made potato chips with the French onion dip to start. The dip was very delicious but the potato chips were a little thinner cut than I'd like and extremely crispy, which some people may enjoy. Our lunches were the Texican Chicken Salad, the Chicken Club with home made fries (best side imo), and the Emilio's Chicken Sandwich with the house slaw. All of our meals were good, though the house slaw was our least favorite side.   I would definitely recommend trying Daddy's Burger Bar. The service is friendly and fast, the food is good, and the ambiance is quite ideal."}
{"text":"One word- SALAD!  This is one of the few times I've felt compelled to write a review of your average burger place. Every time I've been to Bad Daddy's I've ordered a burger and fries, which are awesome, BUT the salad?? My goodness! Talk about delicious. The Texican Chicken Salad has the perfect combination of ingredients and they toss it just right. I also recommend the crispy chicken and not the grilled chicken. It gives the salad the perfect crunch. I would given the place 5 stars, but sometimes the wait can be difficult with a party of more than 4 people. Also, love the secret sauce!"}
{"text":"This is not a five star restaurant, it's a burger place...in an airport. I eat in airports often and as airport food goes this is one of the better choices, especially in CLT.   This is bar none the best breakfast at the CLT airport, get an omelette, it's what they do well. My favorite is bacon, avocado and jack cheese, have them bring you an extra side of salsa .   For lunch/dinner I have had the bacon cheddar burger, I get mine with no bun and a salad instead of the bun and they are very accommodating every single time I ask. I have also had the Stellas Greek salad and the Texican chicken salad, both were good. I like the burger best though honestly.   I almost always sit at the bar and the service is always prompt and courteous. The prices are high, yes, yes they are, they are high at every airport restaurant, this is no exception."}
{"text":"The small salad is a meal for one! Or can be split by 2 people, and used as a side. The veggie burger is made in house, and can be ordered grilled  or fried -- Ive had it both ways and think its too mushy when its grilled. Its delicious fried, but I feel guilty afterward.  Tots are on point, great beer menu too!"}
{"text":"I was starving, it was 10 minutes before closing and I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with a side garden salad. To my delight my order was ready in less than 10 minutes, chicken was juicy, veggies in the salad and on my sandwich were crisp and fresh. Hurray! It was my first time at any Bad Daddy's and the airport location did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Yet another from the Observers recent burger bracket challenge.  I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday.  The restaurant was very busy, but I was able to grab a seat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and took my order.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger on steroids with the house made potato chips as my side.  I also ordered some onion straws as fried onions are one of my weaknesses.  The onions straws came out pretty quickly.  They had a nice spicy bite to them.  They had a chipotle ranch dipping sauce, but really didn't need it.    My burger came out when i was about half way through the onion straws.  It was enormous and looked delicious.  It was almost too big to get my mouth around, but I managed.  It was very juicy with the standard lettuce, tomato, onion along with the two types of bacon, cheese and baconaise.  The house made chips were OK, but I'd probably opt for a different side next time.  Over all a very good burger and good service.  I'm definitely putting Big Daddy's on my list of places to go back to again."}
{"text":"At $40 bucks for 2 black bean burgers and a shake it was very pricey. We popped in here because out of the nearby options the black bean burger was the yummiest and most filling sounding as vegetarians. Despite various servers running around no one tended to us to seat us. I tried to flag someone down, made eye contact, said \"Hi!\", nope, no one was coming to seat us. We grabbed our own menu and sat ourselves down the only place available; the window bar. The chairs were uncomfortable. Soon after a waitress popped by to take our orders. We built very simple burgers, one with only avocado, and the other mushrooms and avocado. We didn't notice it was an extra 2 bucks for the black bean burger, so it was a bit of an unpleasant surprise later.  As it would have been cheaper to order the only veggie burger option and *remove* items, ridiculously.   Our food took roughly 25 minutes to get. In this time frame we saw two empty tables open up, we tried to move to one. Our waitress would not let us move even though we did not yet have our food after nearly 20 minutes. Telling us that the hostess had to approve but was too busy to be talked to and our food was about to be \"ready in a minute\". The wait was long, which was a bit nerve wracking when you have a connecting flight to catch in an hour.   On to the food! The strawberry shake($7!) was OK but too sweet. The black bean burger although crumbly was very good, the chipotle ranch sauce paired very well with it. It comes with a side so I picked the fries. My partner picked the chips/crisps, which were nicely crunchy and thin but needed more salt and/or vinegar for my taste. Also came with a bbq(?) sauce on the side which we did not order, bbq sauce was not our jam.  Tough the food was good, the service is very slow and it is quite pricey! If ever we have another connecting flight here we may just do a to go option if we were ever to try it out here again. But it's hard justifying $30+ for two veggie burgers.  Alas that's airport food."}
{"text":"Do not get the grilled onions..They were very rubbery. Over priced, but you cant find anything that isn't in an aiport. Great fries. Overall it was a good little burger joint."}
{"text":"Bacon Cheeseburger on steroids, 5 stars. Very good. Daughter gives Western Cheeseburger 4.5 stars. Tatertots were good, better than the standard fries.  Fast service: @30 minutes total and they only had 1-2 tables open.  I will return.  What we had was surprisingly good so I felt obligated to share."}
{"text":"Caitlin the bartender was amazing! I had to keep ordering milkshakes from her Togo and she was absolutely wonderful making them with a smile! Her service was wonderful  and she smiled and helped me the whole time she is an asset to your bar!!!! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had a salad and it was really good. The service was quick and friendly. They are also carrying a seasonal Pumpkin beer from NODA brewery right now that is awesome."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's in the Charlotte airport has a good burger and drink menu for slighly jacked-up airport prices.  If you've got at least an hour to burn at CLT, it's a decent place to spend it.  They've got plenty of TVs playing NASCAR and baseball to keep you entertained between flights.    While it is an airport restaurant, it's definitely on the better side, but it's still an airport restaurant.  It can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush, with business travelers, families, all with suitcases and backpacks everywhere.  Service isn't quick, so if you don't have much time before your next flight, you might wanna hit up a different fast-food joint.  But if you are looking for milkshakes or mixed drinks, this is probably your best choice!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. I loved the idea of created your own salad but not of paying extra for a small ramikin of salad dressing. I also tried the sliders and they were okay. I'll stick to Red Robin if I want a good burger."}
{"text":"BAD DADDIES!!!!! I could literally just keep screaming BAD DADDIES!!! over and over again... why you ask???  Because .... they serve a deep fried bacon burger that is sure to give you an instant heart attack. I tried to stretch the walls of my mouth and stomach finishing this massive burger.   Of course I was successful and of course I devoured the entire burger... Might I add... they have awesome chefs.... I ordered my burger med. and it came out medium... I could not believe it....   So the deep fried bacon... I wondered how they did this.. I wondered how this would look .. but baby.... It was awe inspiring... the bacon was so juicy the perfect blend of salty-ness... the burger held together nicely and the fries are absolutely amazing!!! I am definitely making a return trip.   Pros... Pretty much everything ...    Cons @ Dilworth location.. The parking situation :(..... the extremely long wait for a table... I arrived at 5:30 - 6 and we waited almost a half hr.... ( but we met some awesome people while waiting so if was worth it)"}
{"text":"I have been to Bad Daddy's Burger Bar many times (to this location and the Southend location) and I have never had a disappointing meal. They are very consistent with the food quality and taste- which I appreciate as a frequent customer. I usually order the create your own burger and get a turkey patty with avocado, pepper jack cheese and a whole wheat bun. I know what some of you may be thinking - (turkey burger, really?). But honestly, this is one of the best turkey burgers I have ever had! It's moist, lean and has flavor- much better than what I have made at home. I also get a create your own side salad with this- and the salads are delicious as well (I order the spinach as my greens).  If you would prefer to order fries, the sweet potato fries are also a favorite of mine to order. As for a cocktail, I order the Texas mule as it is basically their version of a Moscow Mule. I highly recommend this place to anyone! I am about to move back to the DC area but will come back whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Very good burger cooked exactly like I ordered, on a good roll with fresh toppings. The house slaw is chunky, has a lot of flavor and a little kick, exactly how slaw should be. There was a little bit of a wait on take out, bit they were slammed. Service was with a smile and \"sorry for the wait\". Overall, much better than the majority of airport restaurants and even hotel restaurants. It is pricey, but they have to pay the outrageous airport rents and royalties..."}
{"text":"My partner and I are creatures of habit. We get the chips with pimento cheese, then I get the bacon cheeseburger on steroids (OMG bacon lover heaven!!!!) and he gets the Pittsburgher. I'd love it if they had more in the way of dark beer, but I get it, Charlotte is an IPA kind of town. (Which is still better than when I was growing up, when it was a Budweiser-from-a-can town.) I would love to comment on the desserts, I really would, but the burger is so enormous that I can barely finish it, much less order more food after that!  Also, get the tots, not the fries. Their tots are PERFECTION."}
{"text":"We all have that girlfriend, boyfriend, friend or family member that has every dietary restriction known to man, right? Right. And I'm guilty of being one! I eat gluten free as much as I can and eat a vegetarian diet! But let me give you all a sigh of relief for that inevitable \"Where do you want to eat?\" , \" I dunno you decide, you're the one with the restrictions\" battle: Bad Daddy's!!   Bad Daddy's has it all! Vegetarian options, healthy build your own salad options with a huge selection to load on top, GF buns, even GF beer options (you can ask for GF friendly menu!), and regular burgers for meat eaters.   They have a great black bean burger--The Cantina burger (grilled)--which is what I always order. It is flavorful and fresh--never tastes frozen-- thank goodness!! Nothing more frustrating than going to pay for a black bean burger that you could have pulled out of your freezer, am I right? This is layered with lots of goodness including cheeses, chiles, chipotle and my wonderful obsession: avocado. Between the side it comes with and the side salad that I always build to go with my meal, I leave stuffed and not feeling a lack of any nutrients.   The staff has always been on top of it every time we have come in. They are friendly, quick to care for you and they keep up with the restaurant no mater how busy it is. Each time we have dined here we have had managers come out to ensure the meal was satisfactory. Each time it has been!   Be warned on weekends you will wait but there are two ways to do it: place yourself on the waitlist ahead of arriving via NoWait (via your Yelp app!) or get there and wait double the time without doing it. You'll get glares from those who didn't place their name ahead of time, but it's cool, you still played fair! So go on and sit down on that awesome patio and enjoy your beer and meal that can please the whole group. ;)"}
{"text":"So I decided to eat on the patio for once I always had great service here but I have only one question why have a patio if you cant smoke on it? so the Manager politely asked us to put our cigarettes out and we were on the outdoor patio but he allowed a gentleman to bring a dog on the patio and sit in the chair right behind us. Am I missing something? Well have to say this may be my last time eating here."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. I could put the Bad Daddy's sauce on anything and everything and I swear it would be delicious. Seriously...such a good burger (everything else is great too)"}
{"text":"This location was not as good as the one in Birkdale. We love the chicken club and the chips. The onion rings are really good.  But there is something off at this location in quality compared to the one in Birkdale. The chips are overdone. Wife got a burger and the bun was really wet with grease. Been to this location twice and is more hit and miss than Birkdale. Service is good at both and he staff is friendly. Just a little disappointed yesterday with the food."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, creative options."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially being able to sit on the patio on a nice day. The food is always really good, and I can get a burger salad when I'm avoiding carbs like the plague. I've seen them understaffed thinking no one would sit on the patio (supposed to be freezing, but turned into a great day). The service was slow, but no one was noticed complaining or stressed out. They were all helping each other and still managed to keep smiles on their faces. It probably helps working in a laid back neighborhood. :)"}
{"text":"I picked up linner (lunch/dinner) this evening for myself and a colleague after 6 PM. The place was packed .. Like 20-30 people waiting outside type of packed. Now, mind you it was a very enjoyable, warm Saturday evening in February (which doesn't come around to often). I called in our orders and ran to pick it up on my break. It was ready when I got there. Thank you for that Bad Daddy's! Bar tender was friendly, had the food ready, payment was easy and she was pretty to boot!  Both of us ordered the Catina Burger (black bean veggie burger) and sweet potato fries, which is $9.45 and $10.23 with tax. Delicious! The platter comes with chipotle ranch with the fries and a honey mustard for the burger. I wasn't a huge fan of the ranch, but loved the honey Dijon and dipped the fries in it. Yummy. Fries are good, but nothing too outlandish. The star of the show was the Catina, hands down! Two thumbs up! My coworker got her burger crispy/fried and I had mine grilled. Very hearty burger, homemade.. Not just a patty! Add the fresh, crispy lettuce, red onions and tomato along with a few slices of avocado, and melted cheese on a toasted bun. DELICIOUS!!!!  I also ordered the Create Your Own milkshake for $5.50. I got fresh strawberries, coconut syrup and Ghiradelli chocolate.. It was definitely interesting, very thick and filling, and I loved eating the strawberries at the bottom!   Only gripe would be that price of varying items is a bit high, which is where the 5th star would be. If any of the food were happy hour items, on special or the burger was just $2 off, this would be more of a regular spot instead of a treat. In saying that though, I can't wait to try the salads!"}
{"text":"I have to up the stars, after our third trip here, maybe fourth trip. Food tastes great and usually fast. Tots are amazing but still really salty. The drinks are alright... I would stick with beer. The management is excellent & every visit a person comes and checks that everything was great. That's customer service right there. It's nice to go during the week when it's not hectic."}
{"text":"Love their burgers and sides...the chili-mac is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"When I was returning from a business trip I was flying through Charlotte airport in the early morning and was looking for some breakfast.  I was not interested in the standard breakfast from the chain restaurants. I happened to come across Big Daddy's Burger Bar and noticed that they had breakfast scrambles. I ordered my meal to go so I did get a chance to experience the atmosphere inside the restaurant. The scramble was very good and I would be interested in checking out some of the other items on their menu next time.   If you are flying though Charlotte International and are looking for a good spot to try, I would recommend Big Daddy's."}
{"text":"Bad Daddy's seems to have no pretensions of being anything other than a place to quickly scarf a burger as you're waiting on a flight. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to review them as their food was actually pretty damn tasty. I got the Southern burger with chili, cole slaw, mustard, and relish. Cooked far beyond the medium-rare that I requested, but it was still much better than I had expected. Couldn't even come close to finishing the seemingly bottomless bowl of tater tots, but those were good as well, particularly with the dipping sauce.  Beyond the food, the service was efficient, which is paramount in airport restaurants. No complaints at all. Too bad I don't pass through Charlotte more often."}
{"text":"Solid option for a little indulgence at CLT. Great burgers and fries. The place is also spacious and the service is friendly. Like everywhere in Charlotte, the beer menu could use some work, but overall I'd say this place is solid for an airport."}
{"text":"They have amazing food! I have been a vegetarian for about 17 years and they have the best black bean burger I have ever had! This is my all time favorite place to eat. We drive about an hour to get here and it's worth It. You can put anything you want on the burgers! You can even substitute any burger with a black bean burger. Oh and get the black bean burger fries instead of grilled! They are good either way by Fried is better. They are super nice and the wait isn't too bad. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"For a Saturday night the wait was not bad. They told us it could be 20 minutes, but was only 10-15. The food was delicious and our waitress was great to recommend items (it was our first time there)."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! You can even get beer battered bacon on a burger. Servings are huge. But this isn't just a huge burger. They're gourmet. Pricey for burgers but worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.   I came here on a double date with some friends of mine. They had tried this place before, and loved it. My boyfriend and I had never been.   The first thing I should mention is that it is really loud in there. You have to practically yell just to hear each other.   So, we're browsing the menu and we see that you can make your own burger or salad and even name it. We got pretty excited, thinking that they would actually announce the names of our food when they got to our table, but instead, they just listed ingredients.   I got a salad with romaine lettuce, black beans, cucumber, avocado, a tuna patty, and mango on the side. I got a small, because the large was really expensive, and I figured for $17 the small had to be something substantial. I thought wrong. When our food came, I was given this really tiny bowl of salad, but no mango on the side. I started picking at it, but quickly noticed that the tuna burger was sweet, and not at all good tasting. I noticed a few weird leaves in my lettuce and figured they probably just got mixed in. I also did not receive the mango on the side.   When the waiter came back, my boyfriend pointed out the mango problem to him, and the waiter apologized and took about 10 minutes to bring me a small Mc Donald's ketchup cup sized container of mango. I continue picking at my salad and hardly eating it, and my friends start asking me what is wrong. I start showing them that there is not a single scrap of romaine in the salad, and the cucumbers are missing. The waiter finally returns after about 20 minutes, and all of my friends are already done eating. I have had maybe two black beans the entire time we were there. My boyfriend points out that it is a completely different salad from what I had ordered, and that this lettuce was spring mix instead of romaine. At this point, the manager comes out to apologize. He comps my meal and makes the correct salad for me this time, but packages it up in a box. We then head for home. At this point, I am a complete wreck. My stomach is growling, I'm tired, and I just want something to eat. I hadn't had anything to eat the entire day before going out to this sorry excuse for a restaurant, and after leaving, I still hadn't eaten.   All in all, I think I'm glad they messed up so badly, because there is no way in hell anyone should ever have to pay $17 for a cup of lettuce, two slices of cucumber cut into quarters, 1/8 of an avocado, a tablespoon of black beans, a sample cup of mango, and a disgustingly sweet tuna patty.   The only reason I am rating this place as two stars is because my burger eating friends seemed to enjoy it. It was still really expensive for what it was though."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Shout out to our bartender Ashlee and server Michael who were amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrific service. Waited 30 minutes for my order. Watched those who came in after me get served and finish before I got my meal. AVOID  !!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this place. First off the beer prices are very good and the drafts are served nice and cold. The fried pickle appetizer was good, however they were swimming in grease.   I ordered the Bad Ass burger. The burger patties really didn't have that much flavor, however the fried buttermilk bacon was yummy. (Yes, they have deep fried bacon!)  The burgers are very expensive. Most burgers range from $11-$14.   I'd go back again to try other items, but nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the neighborhood and great outdoor space during the warm months.  Burgers are good.  Tater tots are ok and the sweet potato fries are pretty good.  The best part is the atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"A good place for a decent burger. Just make sure if you ask for it to be medium rare and its not, send it back. A place that makes Burgers shoudl get that right. The sweet potato fries are really good as well. I think I also had the chips and they were good as well."}
{"text":"The wait staff isn't very personable, beers take forever to be delivered, tater tots are average at best and the place is expensive.  The only thing I really liked about this place was the Big Daddy sauce that came with tater tots as a condiment.  Tasted like BBQ sauce mixed with horseradish mustard.  But at the end of the layover, $48 dollars got me 4 Bud lights, an order of tots and a bad attitude.  Definitely hope to never even return to this god-forsaken airport, let alone this price-gouging restaurant."}
{"text":"After living in Birkdale for over a year, I have frequented Bad Daddy's on multiple occasions. I've tried almost every burger on their menu (that's embarrassing), and while they are all very different, I have enjoyed all of my food there!  1. They have the best tater tots. Period. No questions asked. The Bad Daddy's sauce make them that much more enjoyable.  2. The first burger I ever ate at Bad Daddy's was the Frenchie, and it is one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. I also love the bad-ass burger (though I can never actually fit the whole thing in my mouth...). They have a killer tuna burger, as well. Honestly, whatever you get there, it's going to be good.  3.You can substitute any burger/bun (or lack thereof) with each specialty burger (or BYO!). I usually will substitute a lettuce wrap for a bun, and they do a great job wrapping the burger so you can actually pick it up and eat it!  4. If I am not in the mood for a burger, the BYO salad option is awesome. You can add chicken (or a burger!) on top of your salad. The small size is enough to keep me happy if I get a side of tots with it, but otherwise I usually need a large size to keep me full.   5. Spiked. Milkshakes. That is all.  You won't find a better burger joint north of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Decent place but the Bad Ass Burger was a lil too greasy/fatty for me. Kinda wished at the end of the meal I chose a turkey burger."}
{"text":"Some things are good, some not so much.   I know they are famous for their burgers, but my personal favorite is their \"Create your own Salads\". They are big and filling! I always get Spinach with grilled chicken, avacado, homemade mozarella cheese, mandarin oranges, and Peanut Soy dressing. It's really fresh and very tasty!  I also love thier sweet potato fries. I am a huge fan of sweet potato fries and let me tell you, these are really good! They aren't regular fries, they have the zig zags in them (forgot what that's called) and they are cooked just right!   Please stay away from the Tuna Burger. I usually love tuna burgers, but this one was just not good. I thought it was going to be like an ahi tuna filet, but this one actually seemed like ground tuna? It was weird. Anyways! don't get it!   Sometimes their service is quite slow too. So if you are in a hurry, I suggest you go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I are new to the area. We stopped by Bad Daddy's Burger Bar for lunch since it's got very good reviews. It was packed you might have to wait. We, however, decided to sit at the bar and grab some drinks.It is first come first serve in this case, you don't have to wait.   My fiance ordered had some beer. $6 for a giant glass. Worth it. They have a lot of awesome drink options to start off.   The menu options are very big. I ordered cantina burger. It had crispy black bean burger topped with green chilis, avocado & chipotle ranch, cheddar & monterey jack cheeses. The burger itself tasted very delicious and perfect size. the black bean patty never fell apart (some places yes), which made it taste even better. Nicely seasoned or salted and properly cooked.  When you order burgers, they come with a side. I picked coleslaw and it was good. My fiance had his Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. It is burger seasoned with bacon salt, 3 pieces of jalapeno bacon, 3 pieces of applewood smoked bacon, topped with monterey jack cheese, housemade bacon mayo, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onion & pickles served on a bun. It looked giant. He LOVED it. It tasted yummy and super juicy. They cooked it right like a professional. He had sweet potato fries on the side. They are very good as well.   The service was understanding. The bartender was very helpful and friendly. We told him that this was our first time, he helped us decide.  he was more than accommodating and made great drink suggestions! Other staff members were cheerful and very professional.  This is definitely going in the right direction if your looking for a good quality burger, excellent fries, yummy drinks, beer selections, and shakes!!"}
{"text":"Place is AWESOME! Coolest burger options! Pretty sure one had deep fried bacon and another had buttermilk chicken tenders on top. Holy comfort food! A must try if you love burgers. So many to choose from! They have black bean and turkey burgers too. If you aren't a burger fan try one of their huge salads! Delicious!!! Don't come to Charlotte and not try Big Daddy's!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better burger!! Will be here to try different burgers. Not a long wait time and I even joined the line in the way there! Great feature"}
{"text":"My soup came cold and I had to chase my server down. Waited on my check for 23 mins and once I requested it she left me hanging again.  It was too stressful of an experience to recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered from here via Postmates last night and was very disappointed. I ordered the Truffle Fries which were good. Pretty standard that you can get from most places you order them from. I also ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. Bacon on top of bacon slathered with more bacon, how could you go wrong? I was very specific in my order that I didn't want any lettuce, tomato, or onions and that I would like my pickles on the side and NO SOGGY BUN. I thought it was genius when my Postmates arrived and said the restaurant recommended putting my bun in a separate container so it wouldn't get soggy. Why has no other restaurant thought of this? Why didn't I think of this? I was excited to dig in until I opened the container with my burger and found there to be no bacon. NONE! Not one slice. So I thought well maybe it is under the cheese. NOPE. Not one slice out of the 6 pieces that were supposed to be present. I would've been happier had they forgot the beef and only gave me a bacon sandwich. Seriously! I was super sad and frustrated. All I had was a burger that I could've gotten from any burger place with some cheese on top and a side of mayo with bacon in it. I don't even like mayo that much but it was all I had to get the taste of bacon on my burger. To top it off I'm pretty sure my burger was medium rare rather than medium and the taste was ehhh.   Sadly my side order of fruit was the best thing I got. Very fresh and satisfying. Wish I had more of it to wipe my bacon blues away.   Long story short at a place with burger bar in the title, and even more so from a burger with bacon in the title I expect the burgers to be top notch, made how you order them and with everything that's supposed to come on it unless you specify otherwise."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. I love that you can completely customize your burgers and salads to your liking.  The sweet potato fries were awesome. So good. I had a burger with mozzarella, tomato and a wheat bun while my husband had a chili burger. Super good place for burgers!  Our service was really good too. It was late on a Thursday night, so they weren't busy, but our waiter was friendly and nice. She brought us a few beers to taste and our sweet potato fries out quickly (extra points because we were incredibly hungry).  I'd never heard of this place before, though I think it's a chain? The inside is classic sports bar-ish with fun decor and good music."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan but now I am not.  I think I just had my last visit to Bad Daddy's because the competition is flooding in and they are not holding their own in my opinion.   I've been here a handful of times and used to rave about it but something has changed the last couple visits.  The meat isn't as hearty, the fries aren't as crispy, the shakes aren't as creamy.  I don't know...just overall a couple notches down in terms of quality.  I tried the mamma ricotta burger this weekend and the pesto sauce was good, the mozzarella was good but the burger itself was weak.  Even the tomatoes were weak!  They were supposed to be roma and they were not!  But back to the burger...it was limp, it was super bright pink on the inside and it was about as thick as a McDonald's burger.  What the heck happened?  It was juicy in some regards but it was also more so dripping grease than flavor.  Others at my table tried the turkey burger and just a classic burger and they seemed to enjoy their choices just fine.  The fries are small, stringy and greasy so nothing special there...the sweet potato fries are pretty good but that's to be expected.  We ordered the banana pudding and a peanut butter and chocolate milkshake for the table and they were okay but not amazing.  I personally thoroughly enjoyed the banana pudding but others felt it was too sweet.  The milkshake was just boring and too frozen.  It was like ice cream served in a glass.  I couldn't taste the peanut butter in it.    Overall, it just was not that impressive.  The servers were friendly and the atmosphere is fun as always but I just think the quality was suffering for this visit.  I could be persuaded otherwise but giving them a break for now."}
{"text":"I've been here several times but have failed to write about it!!  I graced BD's with my presence yet again this past Friday and I was certainly NOT disappointed!!  They are pretty consistent with everything so it is hard to go wrong.  They pretty much have something for everyone and obviously their burgers are fresh, flavorful and unique!  I have even tried the black bean burger and that was fantastic!  It had a crispy surfaces so you don't feel like you are eating a mush burger which can tend to be the case in other places.  I love the make-your-own burger option.  I also love the make-your-own salad option.  They have fresh ingredients and plenty of options to make your salad satisfying!  The fried pickles are pretty good but I would rather if they were cut into round pieces but beggers can't be choosers!  The ranch dressing they serve alongside the pickles is heavenly.  I LOOOOVE the sweet potatoe fries.  They are always crispy and the perfect cut.  Yummy!  The milkshakes are good, thick, tasty, cold...you know...what they SHOULD be.  The snickers milkshake is sorta like a chocolate milkshake with a few small peanuts floating around.  They either need to add more snickers or carmel or something to make it more distinct in my opinion.    The atmosphere is what it should be...loud, packed, large screen TV's, a hustle in the air and I have never been there without having to wait for at least a few minutes.  This is a good, reliable, neighborhood bar/restaurant.   ***Considering the type of restaurant I shouldn't expect a stellar wine list but they have a VERY limited wine selection and they are too expensive for the brands they are serving."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for an airport restaurant. I grabbed the bacon burger on steroids and fries. This burger was huge! And came with different types of bacon along with baconaise! A bacon lover's dream.   The bacon was plentiful and very flavorful! A little saltier than some bacon, but considering that's how you make bacon, I don't consider it a bad thing.  I could barely bite into the thing it was so big! It had just the right amount of grease to it. Let's be real, a burger cooked with good meat (meant the right ratio of fat) is going to have some grease without being soppy and nasty. This was excellent!  Pros - cooked great! Asked for medium and got medium. It seems simple, but so many places can't get this right, especially in burgers  - ooh the bacon!!! - huge portion! - not a bad price considering the size and that it's in an airport - quick service! Great for when you don't have much layover time.  - bacon!!!!! (Picture that little baby trying bacon for the first time... got it now?) - tasty fries! Disposed some in the baconaise too for a little kick.   Cons - lettuce was brown, wilted shreds. Major turn off, so I picked most off - tomato was so-so. And since I couldn't bite into it well, it came off to fit better. I generally like some produce on my burgers, but was better without most of it (pickles were good)  Do you like bacon? Eat this burger!! Not sure if you like bacon? Eat this burger! Don't like bacon? Well then, we just can't be friends! (I kid, I kid!)"}
{"text":"Seated immediately at almost 6pm on a Friday...our lucky day! The hostess is always bubbly and welcoming. Our waitress was quiet and I hated to keep asking her to repeat herself but she was friendly at least.  Hubby, sons and I shared fried pickles. A tad salty for our liking, but they were ok.   \"Sam I Am\" was my burger of choice. A generous ground beef patty cooked to perfection, an egg fried hard (per my request), a ridiculous portion of ham, American cheese and pesto made for a meal that left me stuffed. I could not finish my tater tots although they were very tasty.   Hubby had the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. Need I say more? 3 pieces of jalapeño bacon and 3 pieces of applewood smoked bacon! He thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Is across from my Dr office and finally had a chance to take my family over there. Very good burgers and chicken. Chris our server was fantastic. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"You know you're a 90s kid when you had tater tots for lunch.....Bad Daddy's let's you order it whenever   Hands down, one of the best places to eat in Charlotte. Have co-workers who drive from parts of SC to eat here. I live 2 minutes away from here (I can see from my balcony whether there is a big line)  Great food and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"If you want a hefty unique delcious burger def go here! I have tried the Sam I Am, The Burger on Steroids and even the veggie burger! All yummy! The sweet potato fries are delicous and crispy. We went for a PB&J milkshake, which is a little heavy but taste EXACTLY like a PB&J!! The staff was friendly but be prepared to wait anywhere from 10-30 mins! However we keep returning!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger! Great flavor and generous portion. Definitely will stop in here again when at the airport!"}
{"text":"Great selection & great food! I am not a huge red meat eater, but when I crave a burger, Bad Daddy's is one of my top picks! The best burgers and can I say the homemade dipping sauce that comes w/ the tater tots is awesome! I look forward to that extra treat every time I come. Be prepared for a wait, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I loooooooove coming here during football season! They have amazing burgers and the fried pickles are out of this world."}
{"text":"AHHH this place is so bad.   All the times I have to be in this miserable airport I've seen this place, usually packed. I was able to sit down and try them out for breakfast last flight I took to Boston.  Breakfast was awful.  Their ingredients are not fresh. I was pained while trying to finish my food.  Bloody Mary horribly made.  The decorations don't make up for food quality. Don't kid yourselves. On another note... it is airport food. I shouldn't have expected any better."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Typical chain restaurant with bubble-headed waitresses. (At least our was). We felt rushed. The food was mediocre. Probably won't be going  here again."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the food is delicious, the atmosphere in here is fantastic.  Every server I've ever had seems happy to be there and they're always on top of things!  I even said to a girl one time, \"This place must be amazing to work for because you guys always seems so happy!\"  She said it was pretty great to work there.  That says a lot."}
{"text":"4 star eat overall, 5 stars among airport food. This place puts out a genuinely good burger. My only complaint was that I would have liked a little more of the toppings-lettuce, pickles, etc. Those were a little skimpy. Other than that, no complaints. Sides were good as well. I see a lot of reviews critiquing the wait time, but I don't know what you'd expect. If you want a quick meal at an airport, get a prepackaged sandwich or something. This is a made-to-order burger, it's gonna take a minute."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The nachos were amazing and the burgers were simply delicious. A very highly recommended place. You won't leave dis-satisfied. The service was great too. Gets crowded so come prepared to wait or find a seat at the bar. Bartender Ellie, is awesome. Definitely will be back again :)"}
{"text":"To me this is the best burger place is Charlotte. I went with friends on a double date. We order nachos which they give you a lot, it was enough for four people. I order a burger which it was exactly how I like it. greasy, toasted bread, with sweet potato fries. I order take out when I don't feel like cooking. Even the take-out be on point."}
{"text":"45 minutes to next flight was not enough time to eat here. Super busy and super slow. Slow kitchen and slow service. Only plus is that the burgers are ok."}
{"text":"I have never been so grossed out at a restaurant in my entire life. I sat next to the window in the booth and they have a SERIOUS FLY problem. They were swarming - 6-10 flies at a time - on the inside of the window. I mentioned it to the waiter and it was almost like he ignored it. My co-worker and I began killing them with what we could find and then we gave one of the note pads with a dead fly on it to the waiter and they looked disgusted - HELLO this shouldn't ever be something a customer should worry about!?! After we would kill a few they just kept coming back. The table top was also very dirty and sticky. It then took 30+ min to get food and at that point I was so grossed out I couldn't eat my meal. Would not eat there until they cleaned the place up and fixed the bug problem."}
{"text":"A few months ago I would have given then 4 stars but now you can order the shrimp burger any day of the week!  They have consistently good burgers that are messy and have flavor. Sweet potato fries are a great side and they have an excellent selection of local draft beer, though I wish they had better beer specials.  The shrimp burger is amazing and you should try one. They also have a burger special that can sometimes be good.  The reason I rate them so highly is that they also have an awesome breakfast.  Grits and biscuits here are dang good!"}
{"text":"Was en route to a meeting and had a layover here, place looked jazzy so I stopped in despite the reviews.   I had a great experience. They do have expensive food, but I had a great waiter, great beer, and a awesome burger. Their sides are gigantic, much like their burgers, and delicious. Big enough to share honesty.   It was noisy, and crowded but had a nice \"dive\" feel to it.   I will be back next time I am running through."}
{"text":"Still a really great burger. Way better than anything you'd get from a certain \"king\" or a red headed lady. Made to order, great toppings and good sides. I loved my tots with a bit of ketchup and some Sriracha from my www.sriracha2go.com. Mmm... filling.  If you sit by the window, you get a great view of the ramp with the Charlotte skyline in the background.  One complaint. $8.99 for a domestic draft?"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger cheeseburger coronary coronary. I chose the Nick's Patty Melt which was a fab slab of meat on rye toast with grilled onions and a side of great shoestring fries. Not the healthiest choice (people come here for salads??) but it was massively delicious and filling.  Decent beer specials and a few local choices on their menu.  Parking at lunch time is a major challenge. All I can say is \"Good luck.\""}
{"text":"In addition to \"Thai lunch Monday,\" \"Chicken Wing Tuesday\", my friends and I also celebrate \"Cheeseburger Friday.\" Simple and self-explanatory but just in case it is not clear... on Friday, we have cheeseburgers.  This week, we chose the Ballantyne location of Bad Daddy's. Not that there's anything wrong with the Dilworth location except for the parking situation.  We were seated inside after we arrived just after opening. A nice sunny day with a good breeze, it was perfect. Great service from a friendly waitress who kept my friend's water glass filled. I had a beer - Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale. It was excellent.  I took the waitress' recommendation for my burger and got the Pittsburger. It was awesome. Fully dressed with American cheese and topped with shoestring fries, it was a mouthful of cardiac arrest deliciousness. I ate the whole thing. And the excellent onion rings on the side.  Not terribly expensive - maybe a bit much for lunch - but a very tasty and very filling meal. I wouldn't recommend it on a work day as I had to head home for a nap. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"My favorite weekend place. Very lively place. They have make your own burgers. My special order would be veggies burger with teeter tots with strawberry shake. Absolutely love it. I can go to this place every day just to have strawberry shake- very yummy."}
{"text":"Bad daddy's grilled cantina burger is my favorite veggie burger in Charlotte. And the tater tots are not to be missed. Service here is always good, prices are reasonable enough."}
{"text":"What to say that hasn't been said...  Come for the burgers, stay for the milkshakes.  I like mine on white, with mozzarella, swiss, applewood smoked bacon, fried egg, chipotle ranch and garlic mayo.  Tater tots on the side.  With a chocolate milkshake.  Damn son."}
{"text":"So many burgers, so little time. It has almost every combination of burger, toppings and buns you can think of. The shakes are thick. The fried pickles are probably the best in town. And the service was great, especially considering how busy they were.   Only downside is the tight seating but the food more than makes up for that."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I am (was) a huge fan of the one in Dillworth, and even enjoyed going to the one in Ballentyne until my last experience, which was Friday April 23rd for lunch.   I like to describe some of the low-lights from my visit; first I was disappointed to see a new menu meant a change to their nachos (and not a change for the better). Second, there were four of us and three orders came out wrong (batting .250 might be good enough to make the Royals but it is a disappointment at lunch). Third, all of the burgers were ordered medium and all four came out closer to rare, which was surprising based on how long it took to bring the food out.   As much as I enjoyed my previous trips to Big Daddy's, I am afraid this was probably my last."}
{"text":"Went here on a low carb diet and was so happy with the lettuce wrap. Most places it ends up messy and you end up eating with a fork and knife, but not here. There was so much lettuce surrounding the burger I was able to eat it like any other burger!  I subbed my fries for salad (+$2) and you get to add 7 toppings like bacon and avocado...or in my case DOUBLE AVOCADO!  They definitely can cater to anyone so if you haven't been, go!  #keto #paleo"}
{"text":"Well I finally made it into this spot and my search for the perfect burger here in Charlotte is OVER!  Have found a spot that will actually cook my burger the way I like it at last.  Medium rare.  And they delivered it spot on.  Yum.  And who knew tater tots could be so good!  Crispy and crunchy and fresh.  Yum again.    I did a \"build your own\" burger but they have some pre-configured house specialties that sounded great too.  Bottom line is whatever you like on your burger, you can have it.  Have I said YUM?  Service is good.  Atmosphere busy and lively. (and a little loud)  I went on Saturday and walked right in at 5:30 but when i left there was a wait with people standing in line.  To me that's a sign of a good restaurant.  Only down side is they are a bit pricey, and the Birkdale shopping area where they are located is a zoo.  There is valet parking available in front of the restaurant if you're lazy and impatient like me."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night and it was amazing. I had the mushroom burger and was definitely not disappointed. The beer selection was good it was a great place to just sit back and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"We've been back three more times since first eating here three months ago, and I have to say that each experience has been as good as the first. The burgers continue to be nothing short of tastetacular and the service has been consistently great and friendly. I've been sticking with the Western Burger but the miss' has tried out some of the others like the Frenchie and the Mama Ricotta's, both of which were pretty tasty. To try and keep it slightly healthier I've been ordering the fruit cup as a side and the fruit is fresh and tasty. It really makes a good ending to the meal and helps cleanse the palate of all the heavy burger goodness. They may serve up pricier burgers but they are some pretty high-quality patties."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  We came here a couple of times since i moved to Charlotte. They have great burgers, friendly service and a laid back atmosphere. The first time we came here we both ordered the cantina burger with fries (I substituted a fried black bean patty in).  The patty had good consistency but lacked seasoning. Luckily, the second time around the patty was crispy and seasoned. The burgers come with fresh toppings and a side. I would go with the tater tots, the fries I got the first time around weren't very special.   I also signed up for the email subscription ( I got a free app out of it) and forgot to use it till the last minute. I had also forgotten to print it out for redemption but the manager oked it luckily. We grabbed the backyard bbq nachos since it was large and unique. They had really good toppings minus the \"queso\", it felt more like processed cheese than actual queso. Trust me, I eat a lot of cheese.   We will be back to try out some more burgers."}
{"text":"Kids review: go straight to the build your own burger section of the menu. Otherwise too fancy. Burger, bacon, pepper jack, period.  Parents review: get the Bad Ass Burger. Lives up to its name. Parmesan truffle fries? Yes, please. Buffalo tater tots? Hell to the yeah. Great draft selection, upgrade from 16 to 20 oz for $1 - not a hard sell."}
{"text":"Oh bad daddy's how I love thee!   Our burgers are  and I could probably make 2 meals out of a serving, but man oh man that banana pudding was something dreams are made of. The whipped cream is mixed in to the banana pudding and it's really something special.   Helps that the service is great and there is always a manager coming by to ensure good service."}
{"text":"Tried this burger joint for the first time last night, and it was just ok. Smaller than I thought it would be, the waitress told us this location was the first and the smallest!  I told the waitress that this was myself and my boyfriend's first time eating here, so I thought we would get better service, but I was wrong! The burgers were rather tasty, but my fresh cut fries were so cold, and inedible; very disappointing! I wanted to order a Vodka on the rocks, but they only had Absolut Vodka left out of several choices at 8:00pm on a Saturday night! I guess what do you expect from a burger joint. Also, they allow dogs on the patio, I love dogs, but I don't want to be around them when I am eating my food. I could of just went inside, but I didn't realize dogs were allowed until, I was already into my meal, and until I noticed the dog bowls on the patio! I will probably go back here, but only for lunch or carry out! I was kind of expecting burgers and cocktails, and just got Five Guys, but at least Five Guys have hot fries!!"}
{"text":"I live the build your own burger option! And they have tater tots! What can go wrong with tater tots!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday evening for dinner. It was not packed as I was expecting because of all the great reviews it had online. I ordered the Frenchies burger and the boyfriend ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger on Steroids. The Frenchies burger was phenomenal because it was different. They added two slices of apples which was not something I would expect in a burger. My boyfriend loves bacon, so to find 6 slices of different types of bacon in his burger made him extremely pleased. I will definitely visit this place again next time I am in Charlotte to try their fried pickles which seems excellent."}
{"text":"Always a good experience at this place. There's almost never a wait, it's loud enough to make up for my noisy kids, the kids menu is great, insanely nice wait staff...and the edemame cashew burger is to die for!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was sweet, the atmosphere and decor fun but the food was alright. My burger looked like a 10 but tasted like meh maybe a 5. It just tasted so plain. Like nothing on it stood out. I had the burger on steroids."}
{"text":"The tater tots are the best here! Whatever burger you get, get a side of tots! Most of the burgers I've tried are really good. The only problem I've had here was service can be a little slow! It's definitely not every server, but there's a few times where we waited for a long time for our server to come back! If you have a good server, then you will most likely have a great time at Bad Daddy's!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and really good fattening appetizers.  Would have to minimize my visits but was a nice try.  Burgers were amazing."}
{"text":"Great burger selection and quality. Allows you to customize your own burgers as well."}
{"text":"A bit overrated to me.  Good burger and excellent banana pudding, but there is no excuse for those skinny little slinky fries."}
{"text":"We've been to Bad Daddy's before and always loved it, but last night was not the best experience.  We expected it to be busy and have to wait for a table since it was Saturday night and we're told it was at least a 30 minute wait.  No problem...we'll sit at the bar and have a drink.  No sooner than we ordered our drinks, we were paged that our table was ready.  We thought it was strange since there were people standing around waiting who had arrived before us.  We were led to what had to be the worst table in the house...right next to the door that led to the patio.  Every single person who passed through that door brushed against me.  The table was sticky, and extremely wobbly, which is completely annoying.  To give credit where it is due, our waitress was awesome.  Very friendly and attentive.  Our food arrived quickly, and was delivered to our table by a woman with the worst attitude I've ever seen in a restaurant.  She was carrying dishes to our table and the one next to us.  No eye contact, she never said a word...she slammed a plate in front of my husband who told here it was not ours.  Without a word she grabbed it and slammed it to the table next to us.  She gave my food to my husband, and I got his.  She left without saying a single word.  The customers at the next table just looked at us in the same disbelief.  My husband asked for ketchup since our bottle was empty, a bottle was dumped on our table without a word.  It was definitely some of the worst customer service we have ever experienced.  The food was great, with the exception of the bacon, which had a weird cinnamon taste.  Maybe it was just an off night, but that was definitely not the experience we expected."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUMMY-Mc-YUMM YUMM  Always delicious, great service, and there's OMB Copper on draft!  Best Tip About this place: Get the Tots!!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after a long night out (it was like 2 pm). We waited for about half an hour and the food was pretty good. Not the best burgers in Charlotte, but still good."}
{"text":"I had the tuna burger on lettuce with a side of fruit and a 24 oz pabst. Everything was delicious. There was no wait and the service was ON POINT!!!! I'm going again today I might try a burger burger but we shall see!!   Highly recommended my mom's and brothers burgers were on point too. My mom got the black bean burger on wheat and my brother got the bacon burger.   The cocktails are on the weak and small side so I wouldn't come here for anything more than the beer specials."}
{"text":"I had the park city pastrami burger and i had the frenchie. Both were pretty good but not flavorful. Certainly not $13 worth.  Beer was cheap. Service was good."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on Saturday and it was quite busy. Service was good but slightly delayed (I guess because they were busy ha!) I agree that their fries are over salted but the burgers are pretty good. Fried pickles are even better.  We had a reservation since I figured it may be helpful to get in faster, it helped. So if you have a family of 4 or 5 and up call and make sure the have room specially if you are going here for lunch or dinner on a weekend.  I should have taken picture of my food...maybe next time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had!!! I just had a plain cheeseburger because I'm picky but damn, it's good!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers! Love the tots! Bad Daddy's is one of the best places in Charlotte for a burger and the bar is pretty incredible. Parking is great, the line to get in sometimes isn't. MIght have been able to do a better job with the outside seating area, but it is all about the burgers."}
{"text":"I always have a nice, quick meal at Bad Daddy's. The food is good the people are nice, I can usually get a booth if we go at the right time and the only thing that is a little tough about it is the noise level. Everything seems to bounce off the walls and echo for the entire time you're there.  The burgers are great! and it gives me a chance to have my burger and a make your own side salad in order to feel like i did something healthy rather than finishing off the meal with the TOTS that are out of this world."}
{"text":"Great food. Atmosphere is family friendly. Wait staff is courteous.  While the burgers are not the best in town, they are tasty and I've never had a bad meal here.  I like that they offer many options such as a vegan burger (which is delicious - order it fried), tuna burger, buffalo burger, turkey burger and grilled chicken breast.  I've had them all except for the buffalo burger and all have been good.  My usual is the chicken breast on lettuce wrap for buns.  The tater tots are great, the home fried chips are excellent, and the onion strings are so tasty.  Fried pickles are my favorite appetizer.  There is a salad menu that sounds promising but I have yet to try their salads.  What more can I say, I eat here often and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Good service, but mediocre food gives this place 2 stars. If you want a few drinks then this is your spot, but the burgers and appetizer (Homemade Chips) we ordered was subpar. Structural issues with burgers oddly irritates me. I expect to be able to eat a burger with my hands, and not have to eat it with a knife and fork, which was the case here. I would only go back here to enjoy a beer."}
{"text":"This place is a GREAT burger place! Their meat is super good, and the combos and toppings, top it off! (Pun intended)   Outside seating is great for people watching :)"}
{"text":"My family's favorite restaurant. Kids love the buffalo wings or strips. My favorite is the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place, oh the burgers were awesome!! The food, flavor, atmosphere was very pleasing, presentation of the food was Excellent. Offering something for the whole family. My husband and I enjoyed our meal. The shop was both clean and tidy, having plenty seating. The hostess/ waitress was attentive at all times. Staff members there greeted us in/ out when we left. The food was more than filling, loved all the dishes thus far. We will certainly be returning soon and would recommend this facility. Im sure everything is a must try! Great meal..."}
{"text":"We stopped in to Bad Daddy's for dinner the other night while driving through Charlotte to get a quick bite to eat. There was a wait for tables so we sat at the bar. The bar tender, Brett was really friendly and helpful. He gave us an explanation of the menu and shared what some of his favorites are. The menu can definitely be intimidating since there are so many options, but boy, what fun!    You can select one of their 'pre-defined' burgers, or  build any burger that you want.  You have the choice of beef, chicken, turkey,buffalo,  black bean or even ahi tuna for your burger, and many topping, condiment and cheese selections.The salads work the same way, you choose your lettuce and then choose the vegetables, cheese, proteins, toppings and dressing that you would like. The DH and I decided to split a salad and a burger. We added the jalapeno bacon at Brett's recommendation to our burger and boy was that bacon good! It added a nice spice and flavor without being too hot. The burger was cooked perfectly, it was pink, juicy and delicious!  We got the tots for a side and they were served with a nice tasy dipping sauce. I was commenting to my DH that the balsamic vinaigrette was too sweet and Brett heard me and immediately turned around and asked if I'd like some straight balsamic vinegar to tone it done. That was just what it needed and I was really impressed with that level of service.   Even though this is a chain, they seem to work hard to make you feel like it's your neighborhood burger joint. I'm very excited that we have one in Raleigh now and can't wait to try it out!"}
{"text":"For a burger place, it's also a decent spot for breakfast.  Their biscuits are legit. If you order them you'll get two that are the size of a child's head. Light and fluffy on the inside like they should be. There are plenty of choices from make your own omelets to French Toast.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I did reach out to him Amy.  I received an email that stayed to send him my number and he would contact me.  That was 2 weeks ago.  Never received a call or any contact.  Apparently no one at Bad Daddy's cares in the least!"}
{"text":"Custom built burgers and dirty shakes are the best!"}
{"text":"So Big Daddy's isn't really as disappointing as I initally made it sound. It was never bad in the first place, it just didn't live up to my overly meticulous expectations. The caveat about this place though is you have to find something that works for you; hence the endless amount of customization they offer....but at a premium of course. I'm still going to disagree with their credo; not everything on the menu is very very tasty. Not all items are worth a second chance.   The Buffalo Chicken sandwich. It was chicken, I'll give them that. As far as the hot buffalo sauce though, it was either just sprinkled or just plain non-existent. All you could taste was the overwhelming blue cheese.  The sides are still just sides. I can't say they're better than other chips, fries, tots, onion straws or mac N cheese I've had anywhere else. Tasty nonetheless.  And now the star of the show. My favorite burger, the Sam I Am. Oh how I do love thee. I didn't think I'd like ham on my burger, but dang it fits the formula perfectly. Now the pesto I can do without. I was never a big fan of pesto in the first place, but I wanted to give it an audition with the burger. Now that I have, I'm still not a big fan of pesto.  Management makes it a point to ensure customers are satisfied and I still appreciate that. I like the uniqueness they bring to the table, and the inventive burgers - although I might not like them all. You can't deny the fact that they strive to please and strive for perfection. With what seems like infinite ingredient combinations, I'm sure we can all find our pièce de résistance eventually."}
{"text":"Service was great. Get the truffle fries, you will thank me later. I got the Frenchie turkey burger and it was fantastic. Portions are plentiful, they have some of the best sweet potato fries I have ever had. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Fyi the ladies room is next to the walk in cooler, wear your coat, it's freezing in there"}
{"text":"Ok, awesome , totally awesome. No complaints at all which is amazing considering. They've only been open a few weeks. I had magic mushroom burger and sweet potato fries and all were great. Service was fantastic.  Great new addition to the area."}
{"text":"Not really what I expected . I went to diner with a group of 8 people for a Birthday. Out of the group, it was everyone's first visit to Bad Daddy's. Anyways, the apps were the best part of my meal. Thai chili wings, great. Truffle fries, not great at all, more like burnt. Chicken applie nachos, something different, not bad. Fried pickles, my favorite dish of the night. I had the Western Burger, the hamburger meat was not for me. it wasn't beef and I did not enjoy my meal. My neice ordered The Mama Ricotta burger. she didn't receive her pepperoni. Table service was decent."}
{"text":"Awesome!  First time going but it definitely won't be my last. I had the Frenchie with a beef burger and onion rings and omg..what a combination! My friend got the shrimp burger and tots and loved it as well!"}
{"text":"Only a 3 star from me.  Heard lots about it but somehow didn't live up to the billing (supposed top 25 burgers in US).  Burger was good, but ordered medium rare and pink was missing and was slightly on the small side.  Huge collection of quality toppings available.  Music was too darned loud.  Will try them again but had a better burger at Cowfish."}
{"text":"Wow the chefs are a huge fan of salt. After messing up our order twice I went ahead and tried to eat the overbooked burger. Overloaded with salt and the flavors simply weren't developed on the rueben burger. Wife had custom burger with pimento and the fried bacon. Pimento has no zing and the bacon was very sweet. The manager tried to salvage situation with a free dessert. Nice gesture but the dessert wasn't great, either. Disappointing for how popular this place looked."}
{"text":"Silly me, of course I would get a grilled chicken sandwich at one of the best burger joints in Charlotte. I will have to go back and get my filling of beef goodness.  My sandwich was suburb drizzled in buffalo sauce and crumbled blue cheese. Chandler and I ordered sweet potato fries and fried pickles... I don't think we could eat the tasty fried apps fast enough.  In true fashion Chandler ordered the Carolina burger and it was dripping in with chili. With a wide variety of burgers, one could order a black bean burger or a stacked buffalo burger topped with bacon. Our waiter was friendly and speedy since we told him we had short lunch break.  While Big Daddy's is a pricier than your average burger place, it is well worth it.  Next time I'm craving a juicy burger come find me at Big Daddy's."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers! Our server Daniel was on top of his game, he knew the menu inside and out and made excellent recommendations. Try the jalapeño beer and big daddy Amber..delicious! If we are ever in the area again, will def stop by."}
{"text":"I bit pricey, but worth every bit of it when you are in the mood for a great burger or salad. Lots of options on a great menu. Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I decided to try them out for lunch because they got a lot of recommendations for their salad. However, looking at their menu, I could not resist a burger. Being that I am on a very low carb diet, I decided to go with a lettuce wrapped Bacon Cheeseburger with a Small Salad on the side. It was hard though, because I REALLY wanted Texas Toast! It looks yummy in other pictures. Walking in to pick up my order, being my 1st time, I didn't know where to go. But standing there at the podium, waitresses would look at me and keep doing whatever they were doing. It wasn't a lot of people in the place at the time & so this annoyed me. I just decided to go to the bar since that's where most restaurants serve pickup orders. They were indeed able to help me there.  I'd never done a lettuce wrapped burger before so I was really nervous on how this would turn out. However, I did not regret my decision! It was delicious! I was most nervous about the lettuce being soggy resulting in a messy burger, but they give you fresh crispy lettuce. It held together fine, even when I added my sauces. Those burger pattys have so much flavor. Normally, I don't eat a lot of bacon on my food. Actually I don't eat a lot of bacon period. When I do I'd rather have it alone with grits and eggs. But that was seriously the best bacon i'd ever tasted. It was sliced to the best thickness and fried perfectly. It had a hint of sweetness and you could taste the apple smokiness in it. I took it off my burger and ate it separately after I finished. Saved the best for last. Don't judge me. I mean what are ya'll doing to that bacon? Can I order a supply? I could eat that bacon all.... ok I went on a bit of a bacon rant. Let me snap out of it. So out of curiosity I tried the Garlic Mayo, BBQ Sauce & the Bad Daddys Sauces. Then they were all so good I couldn't decide which to put on my burger. So I stared at my burger for 5 minutes evaluating my taste buds. I ended up going with the Garlic Mayo & BBQ. But I took the Bad Daddys Sauce home to eat with my chicken breast I cooked for dinner. Can't let good sauce go to waste.   On to the salad which was also delicious. I've definitely found my new salad spot. You can choose up to 7 toppings free and after staring at the list for 5 minutes, I finally used all 7. I felt like if I didn't, I was wasting food. I mean some people want 8 toppings and here I am struggling to choose 7. The nerve of me! I would not let my people down. I loved the Broccoli in it. It's like they blanched it with a little flavor because it wasn't completely raw and was tasty! That little salad gave me everything I needed! It was so fresh & that balsamic was one of the best i've ever tasted! Bad Daddy's definitely has a new regular customer!"}
{"text":"I dined here last night and was presently surprised. Very good service,  but best of all was the awesome All American Burger. Very good, plentiful beef patty cooked just as I ordered it. Fresh, ripe, red tomatoes, shredded lettuce, red onions, dill pickles. This is not your average garden variety burger.   I recommend Bad Daddy's to any one looking for more than just a ho hum burger."}
{"text":"Holy mother of cow that was a good burger.  I had the mama ricotta burger with sweet potato fries.  Great made to order burger and had the texas mule cocktail that was also fantastic.  I would eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Anytime you say \"burger,\" I am down... napkin tucked into my shirt and fork and knife ready.  Still have a special place in my heart for the original location, but this location in Ballantyne is just as good and I'm sure the people in South Charlotte like not having to go too far to get some delicious burgers.  Local craft beers are on tap here and there's even a Bad Daddy's Amber, which is quite good.  Nothing beats a burger and a beer after a long day.  Our last visit here, we had a rather large group and a baby, but the hostess gave us a booth and added a table.  It was worth the wait and it's nice to know they are really there to help you have a great experience every time.  Our server was very good, even though we were such a big group... we always had refills and our orders were cooked to perfection.  My personal favorite is the Sam I am... but all the burgers are quite good.  You can even build your own... or swap our turkey or a bean burger instead of beef in any of the prefixed burgers on the menu.  I am also partial to tater tots... but any of the sides here are great.  Overall a great place to get a burger if you find yourself in the South Charlotte area.  Probably my one complaint is the parking lot in the shopping center (shared by other businesses and the Harris Teeter).  Once you get parked though... clear sailing to burger heaven."}
{"text":"Had a DELICIOUS \"Sam I am\" burger here over the weekend.  Bad Daddy's never fails to amaze me every time.  I always leave pretty satisfied and so full that I usually have trouble getting back into my car without having to unbutton my pants... but that's probably TMI right now - back to the review.  The Bad Daddy's is located in Birkdale Village and makes a nice contribution to all the shops and movie theater nearby.  Fairly large dining room and nice outdoor eating area where you can easily people watch on a nice day.  On our particular visit Saturday, it was a bit overcast and cold, but there was a 20min wait for a table inside and we decided to brave the elements.  The server brought us out to a table that had no chairs.  Not by any fault of her, but there was a large table of 12-14 year-olds sitting at the table next to this sad empty one.  The server was pretty quick on her feet and started bringing chairs from other tables while these 12-year-olds tried to apologize - more so, \"fake\" apologize to the hostess.  I spent a large amount of time trying to figure out where these kid's parents were and why they were allowed to hang out at a restaurant like that.  Not that they were being unruly, but you could tell they had been there a LONG time and our server was having a hard time dealing with them and their giggling.  We were starving so we ordered some Irish Nachos which were pretty darn good.  That Guiness Beer Cheese makes a huge difference!  But you can already tell our server was already a little peeved at our next door table.  I think that accounts for a slow service, but to give her credit, she did pretty well for the circumstances.  Our food took so long that we ended up ordering another Irish Nachos that should have come to the table with our food, but went to the table next to us (by mistake) but we didn't have time to say anything since we were fully stuffing our faces with our lunch orders.  We ended up getting the Nachos to-go and the manager apologized and comped us for the order with the mix-up.  Aside from some age demographics here, this location ranks up there with the original over on East.  Can't go wrong with a decent beer selection and really really good burgers."}
{"text":"I thought I had already written a review for this location.  In the past year or so. I've had numerous visits to this location.  Not only does the food stand out but so does the service.    The wait staff almost always asks you if you have any questions about the menu, explains the specials and is helpful in giving a recommendation.  They are attentive in filling drinks and the management checks on you to make sure everything is good.  The food....Oh man.  In my opinion (as well as other people) they have the best burgers in town and by far the best salads.   I love Stella's Greek Salad.  And I usually go for the Frenchie turkey burger or the Banh Mi pork purger but occasionally I stray and order beef.  There are a few servers that go well beyond the average server there.  On a recent visit, my check arrived promptly. One of the managers noticed my sweet potato fries looked funny and brought out a fresh batch. And the server brought a tea to go without even asking.    It's things like this that make a difference and influence my tip and a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"My wife & I ordered 2 burgers on a Friday evening during a layover.  On the register, it was posted that it would take 10 to 15 minutes for orders to come out, but our order came out a little more than 10.  We were very impressed with our burgers, but were not too thrilled about the price.  Once you factor in airport prices, you then add the cost of the toppings you add."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place 3 times. Never been disappointed with the food. Tater tops are good and the hamburgers are huge. Also very tasty is the build your own salad. Place can be a little loud but it's ok. Not really too kid friendly. But all in all I give 4 stars. They would have received 5 stars if their waitstaff showed more customer service skills. All  3 times I have visited the hostess didn't greet us as we walked in or out of restaurant. The waitstaff didn't bother to check on us much. On this last visit my glass of water sat empty for most of my meal. Not only do we pay for our food we also pay our servers to give us good customer service. My boyfriend and I always leave a good tip even for bad service. Everyone has their bad days."}
{"text":"Gluten-free menu, good food (specifically burgers and salads), good service...  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kick off to vacation - I wanted a burger and a beer. Definitely not bad for an airport locale!  They had a good fucking burger, paired with a couple cans of a local brewery on hand (NoDa Brewing).   Not the best fries in the world, but they were that perfect temp when it was chilly outside the airport.  Order the western burger - has a great kick!"}
{"text":"Conveniently halfway along the C concourse, well lit, lots of TVs with good sight lines to each. Pleasant, helpful an enthusiastic staff. \"Bacon burger on steroids\" was excellent despite the dubious name, with a rich smokey sauce and fries that held their shape and texture well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch with a friend and her daughter. They're child friendly midday, gave us a booster seat and crayons. The basics but some places don't provide them so I figured I'd mention it.  Lots of burger choices, I settled on an All American. Burger was huge, fell apart on the first bite, next thing I knew my bun has disappeared. I wouldn't order another burger here for that simple reason. I asked for added caramelized onions and apparently they turned my burger into a slip and slide. The fries are awesome, I'd definitely recommend getting them as a side. My friend went for the make your own salad, which came in a tiny bowl, not exactly ideal for mixing, she just tossed the whole thing into her fry basket. In one word our meal was messy."}
{"text":"I saw a couple reviews complaining about the prices, especially on the adult beverages. While we didn't order any booze on our visit, I do want to point out that this is in an airport so I wouldn't be expecting any happy hour specials. Like with a lot of airport restaurants this place was very busy on a weekend but we had no wait getting a table. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. Both the buffalo chicken sandwich and turkey burger were really good. I mean they were regular restaurant really good, not just an airport restaurant really good. While I enjoyed our meal, the main reason for the 5-star rating is the service. Our waitress Aubrey was one of the nicest people I have ever met. I even made a comment to the lady that I wish every day that I was as happy as Aubrey was. She had a great personality, checked on us just the right amount, and was extremely polite. I could see how someone who works in a busy restaurant in a busy airport could get frustrated and crabby, but it apparently doesn't have an effect on her. Thank you for a great dining experience in the middle of a long travel day."}
{"text":"Had a layover at Charlotte's airport so my husband and I decided to stop here for a beer and a burger for dinner.  The beers were nice and cold and LARGE!   That was nice...it all went downhill when I ordered the \"Frenchie\" which is the turkey burger with brie, bacon, grilled apples and mayo.  What arrived was a burger with brie and bacon. The waiter forgot to tell me they were out of apples.  No big deal...until I take a bite.  When I say this turkey burger tasted like Alpo dog food, I am not exaggerating.  It was downright awful and I couldn't eat any more.  I noshed on some sweet potato fries and drank my beer.   Will try this place again but will definitely NOT order the Frenchie."}
{"text":"I love this place. The burgers are on spot. The chili is good. And they have these awesome alcoholic milk shakes that make a great dessert!"}
{"text":"Killer food, cool atmosphere, but the best part of the visit was our server Kerri. True customer service skills, super friendly and pleasant, and great menu knowledge. To top it off, my wife left her sunglasses on the table when we left, and here comes Kerri running into the street to stop us and return them as we're driving away. Lit."}
{"text":"I was in town last week overnight and was really looking forward to one of their burgers and I was not let down. I got the bacon, bacon jalepegno, bacon salt and bacon mayo all on top of a 1/2 pound burger!! Sooo good and it was take out. Fresh, crunchy, juicy, cooked the way it want. No complaints. I will be back the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I am giving two stars when I would give one but the manager did the right thing.  First, my wife got a nut (the other end of a metal bolt) in her nachos.  Yep, you got that right, a metal bolt in her nachos.  The manager said it came off the fryer.  The manager comped our meal, which was the right thing to do, but whoa.  On the other end, I had the basic burger with cheddar, bland and boring.  I love a good burger and this just wasn't it.  Yes, a basic burger I did not expect to be wowed, but I was hopeful for a good.  It was boring, had little taste, and with all the burger places around, I need to be wowed.  Five Guys this is not.  The nachos, aside from the added metallic objects included, were bland as well.  Nachos are to have flavor and it just wasn't there.  Skip this one, there are other places to go."}
{"text":"The Buffalo Burger is soooo good! The Fries are awesome, but when you pair them with the Bad Daddy's Sauce they are out of this world! The Bacon burger on Steroids is a really good one too, I've also tried the banana pudding, and it was also great! All around great place!"}
{"text":"A really long wait considering I was ordering from the \"to go\" counter. My understanding is they prepare your food just like you were sitting down at a table so it took 20 minutes. Not great To go at an airport. That being said the salads were reasonably priced and huge so we were super full. Great if you want to be healthy in the terminal! Didn't try the burgers"}
{"text":"It's airport food, what can you say? Firstly, they have no place to stowe your bags. You're forced to keep your bags with you next to your table...not smart.  Me & Jame split an order of wings...they were small in size...the taste was less than average.  There are much better options."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Definitely the best burger in Charlotte.  The beef is savory and flavorful and their sandwich combinations are creative and tasty.  Onion rings and sweet potato fries are also wonderful.  I also like the atmosphere... small and friendly.   If it's crowded you can always get take out!  Each time I've gone I've been too full by the end of the meal to enjoy the adult milkshakes, so if you want one then save some room!"}
{"text":"Simply put..... Their Bad Ass Burger is something every burger expert should experience before they die! If not for just the buttermilk fried bacon alone, then for the $3 beer specials. I was tempted to go back but I only had sooooo much time to spend in Charlotte. Definitely worth a visit if youre ever in town."}
{"text":"This review focuses on their breakfast which is served on Saturday and Sunday only. Yum....!  Ok. I suppose I could stop there but worry if I did it may impact my chances of getting any \"Useful\" clicks. Between our table I was able to try scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, fruit, Eggs Benedict and the Greek Popeye scramble that had spinach, mushrooms, tomato and feta in it. Everything was excellent, just like the burgers at lunch/dinner. And yes, they do have a \"breakfast burger\".  One thing to know about the Benedict is that it comes with Queso on it and the Hollandaise on the side so it's a bit different but still delish. Overall, it wasn't too busy so I'm hopeful that word will spread that they serve breakfast so they get busy enough to keep serving it!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent  place for Burger and sweet potato fries, the western Buffalo Burger was also really good.  Jasmine gave excellent service and we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I don't give five stars often, but for burger bars, this place is the beginning and the end.  From the atmosphere to the food, this place was incredible.  I was in Charlotte a few weeks back to visit friends, this was our first stop.  And, we went back.   The burgers were great and I had two.  The Mama Ricotta's and the Frenchie.  Both were incredible.  The Frenchie was a turkey burger and was mouth wateringly delicious.  The apples, turkey and brie, bacon and delicious house mayo was incredible.   This was not for the health conscious, despite being turkey, but for the taste conscious, it was fantastic.  The sides were as good as the main course.  From the tator tots to the sweet potato fries, it was all wonderful.  The pimmento mac and cheese...i could go on for hours!  Beyond the food, the drinks and desserts were wonderful.  I have to advocate LOUDLY for the Peanut Butter milk shake.  Peanut butter, being one of my favorites, was an incredible treat.  This super thick shake was delicious. One of my companions ordered an adult shake, spiked with various liquors which she claims out did mine; a matter of perception I suppose.  Either way...there was nothing bad about this place.  There is indoor and outdoor seating, the wait staff was fantastic...this place is the real deal.    I would not return to Charlotte without taking a lovely drive through Dilworth to Big Daddy's!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, great food,clean restrooms. You can tell they use fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Okay, I am obviously well over 21. Carding me is a waste of everyone's time, especially mine.  I place a high value on my privacy and my time. My only objective is to sit at the bar, get a drink, pay and leave in the least amount of time as possible -- and without opening myself up to any sort of privacy violation."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday night for the first time. Very crowded, but we were seated right away. The way for a patio table was over an hour, so we passed.  Ordered a Badass Burger, Bacon burger on steroids and the parmesan fries.  The fries were extremely salty, I had a few bites and only because I was starving from not eating all day. I don't know if it's usually like that or just a fluke, but I will never order those again.  I ate the bacon cheeseburger, it was very good even with the overdose of bacon. When I read the descriptions I had to try it. My date had the Badass burger and she was in heaven. This fact means that I will have to come back. The burger is huge, but not something that most people won't be able to finish.   Personally, it wouldn't be on my list of places to return to, but if my date wants to come back I will. It has a popular reputation around town, and I'm glad to have tried it at least once."}
{"text":"I love that this location isn't as swamped as the one in Dilworth. My date and I didn't have to wait at all. We opted for patio seating since it was a warm Sunday afternoon. Knowing that we were about to devour very huge burgers, we skipped the appetizers and went straight in for the kill. She had the Bad Ass Burger, 10 oz with buttermilk fried bacon, and I opted for the Pittsburgher which is a mere 7 oz with shoestring fries. Sides were French fries, and chips with onion dip respectively. The burgers were big, delicious, made to order. We almost made it to the end of our burgers, we didn't want to force it since Ben & Jerrys up the block was calling out to us. Service was great, burgers even better."}
