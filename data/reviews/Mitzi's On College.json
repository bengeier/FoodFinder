{"text":"I have to say, after reading such positive reviews about Mitzi's I was a little underwhelmed. I didn't mind the half hour wait as it's expected at prime brunch hour at all popular brunch spots... nor did I have a problem with the service. I just wasn't very satisfied with the poached eggs on the fish cake I had ordered. The fish cake had a funny taste to it, which I didn't particularly enjoy. In addition, my poached eggs were on the overcooked side. The runny egg yolk is the best part of poached eggs...  That being said, we also ordered their famous pancake, which came topped with Bailey's irish cream cheesecake. It was more like a dessert and was oh-so-delicious! Like many others have mentioned, this isn't your typical light fluffy pancake. It's really thick and dense, but so tasty! My boyfriend and I definitely had a sugar coma after eating that bad boy.  Like I said,  my experience was a hit and a miss..given the great reviews, I'd give it another shot - and i'd definitely order the pancake again!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. It's quirky with mismatched chairs and table settings. They give you water with a cranberry in it. Mugs are used, possibly gathered from some office building. The message is that they're a peoples restaurant on the corner and can't afford really nice stuff. The menu follows suit being odd combinations of things.  But then you start to realize this is all surface level. The restaurant is really trying to pull of this quirky thing but doesn't pay attention to what matters. The staff doesn't care and are noticeably rude, the prices are ridiculous ($100 for breakfast!?!), and the food although sounding interesting is bland.   Mitzi's fooled me for a second but now its apparent this restaurant is just another cookie cutter chain, hiring staff that don't care, that's trying to fool us into thinking unique and local. I can see this remaining popular with a certain crowd that enjoys the surface level of things - but I need more real substance.  2 stars for almost pulling this one off on me."}
{"text":"Ventured here on a weekend and expected a long wait. Surprisingly we were seated within 5 minutes and waited on immediately. However, if you do have a wait a bit for your table, fear not, the coffee bar in the back has a cup of joe (latte or tea, etc)  ready  for you to enjoy in the waiting area complete with booth seats and magazines. Now here comes the catch about this place, it's way OVERPRICED! $13 for french toast or eggs and toast is absolute ludicrous if you ask me. Yes the aforementioned dishes we tasty but the price couldn't help but leave a bitter taste in your mouth.  I recommend this place is you aren't footing the bill or are really trying to impress someone the morning after."}
{"text":"I'd never even thought to try Mitzi's for weekend brunch as it always seemed packed, but this Saturday past it was actually empty at noon. We had a nice seat in the shade on the side patio. There were only about 5 choices on the menu - I assume they change according to what's fresh. I was concerned that they wouldn't be able to accommodate my extremely limited dietary choices, but the waitress was happy to make changes. My partner started with the Raspberry Lemonade (\"Delicious!\" he declared) and ordered the chicken club with side salad. I opted for the omelet with Ontario vegetable confit and mozzarella cheese. Normally the eggs are paired with homefries, toast and fruit, which unfortunately I can eat none of. So I asked if I could have the plain yogurt instead, and the waitress even offered a side salad. Perfect! The food was prepared quite promptly (but again, there were only 2 other tables there) and everything was delicious. There were still fruit slices on my plate, but I assume the kitchen did that out of habit for plating. My partner was happy to take care of them for me. Depending on my overall feeling about a place, that kind of lack of attention to detail may be the dealbreaker, but in this instance I was more than willing to overlook it as they were so willing to accommodate my substitutions request. I did not try the chicken club, although it looked tasty enough. The mixed greens salad is lightly coated with the perfect summer mustard vinaigrette. I enjoyed the confit - eggplant, tomatoes, etc - although mozzarella was a bit lackluster and rubbery for this particular dish. A more flavorful gruyere or feta would be quite nice.  A strict vegan would have a difficult time with the limited menu, but as a grain-free, sugar/fruit-free, vegetarian, I left very satisfied."}
{"text":"They make this Buttermilk Oatmeal pancake that I dream about at night....and who am I kidding, all day, too!  I like Mitzi's a lot.  I have come for brunch on weekdays, and it's nice to have a leisurely brunch with many coffee refills.  On a weekday I usually have the eggs, and I appreciate the potatoes.  But what I'm really dreaming about (as discussed) is that pancake....  You just have to try it to believe it!  I think it might be deep-fried?!  I have no idea how that thing is made.  This sort of weekend brunch will cost about $11-15 plus coffee, but if you're feeling decadent, it really is worth it.  A friend of mine once ordered the French toast, and that was also hefty and delightful.  I will definitely try coming here for dinner some time!"}
{"text":"Oh dear god, that PANCAKE. It was so, so delicious. I don't even want to think about how fat I am going to get now that I know it exists.  I really liked the place; cozy, nice servers, good coffee. I really liked their breakfast potatoes, too. I always have a really hard time when I go out for breakfast because no matter what, I crave potatoes; so I was very pleasantly surprised to see a tiny mound of taters on the plate next to my heavenly pancake. Perfect.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Let me be clear.  Mitzi's for brunch is great, and worthy of many stars. This rating is for dinner, which expensive, greasy, and tasteless.  Stick to brunch!"}
{"text":"With confidence, I can state that this place serves up the best french toast platter I have ever had. Hands down.  Hand it to the fact that it comes with a dollop of freshly whipped cream on the side, or maybe it was that delicious lemon-infused other creamy thing perched atop my slices of peach (which were, bizarrely, meant to be Ontario raspberries according to their menu, but all is forgiven).   Perhaps what won me over was the fact that the french toast already comes glazed with just the right amount of maple syrup, or that the the folks at Mitzi's kitchen had happily married both Egg and Bread together - harmoniously and balanced. What certainly helped was that I got a nice serving of their signature potatoes on the side, thereby preventing sweetness overdoses.  I don't know what it was, but does it matter, folks? It was, in short, unforgettable.  Other observations:  - Cranberries in the water. Umm... unique? - A little on the pricey side, $13 for french toast? I'll have to save this for special brunch occasions. - Light and airy decor, kind of like a sparse children's room. - Have heard wondrous things about their pancakes, will be giving them a try the next time I am in the mood for a non-savoury brunch."}
{"text":"Service was bit slow, consider the place was not full....we waited 20-30min for our food to arrive. But my poached eggs was delicious...I must say one of the yummiest brunch in Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a SUPER dinner here this week.   The prices were reasonable and the selection looks to be aimed at adult child (chicken tenders, burgers, and nachos, amongst others).  They were great. Nachos were perfectly covered in heaps of homemade guac, beans, salsa, cheese and sour cream.   I had a chicken/chorizo burger with salad for $13, and my DC had a giant veggie burger which was scrumptious and moist. Both came on a big milk bun (which may have been a little much, but tasted great).  The place was near empty, so we had prompt service getting our $6 tall cans of Creemore to the table and after we paid the bill....the chef came out with just out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. WARM COOKIES.  I'll be eating here more often!"}
{"text":"It is so close to me, in physical proximity---AND YET---feels so far away from my daily thoughts, yearnings, and gastric rumblings.   The food is serviceable---they have many items (too many)---the place is not offensive to you, or me in terms of its minimalist but cutesy warmth. Unless inoffensiveness itself causeth offense.   The problem is a distinct lack of love. (You know what a \"lack of love\" is at breakfast? It's the same useless portion of unsightly fruit that \"brightens\" the corner of a plate--more out of sheepish obligation then intent---that you have eaten at every brunch restaurant missing a sense of purpose and commitment.)  The food's not bad---it's just not committed. A & U (e.g.) has commitment in their food and this review is for people who understand this without my having to explain what a good restaurant should make by hand, how often the specials need to change, how many menu items is too many, what good ingredients look like etc...  EXCEPT: THE PANCAKE is regularly excellent! (how could I forget the pancake? Maybe because it is drowning amongst its mediocre brethren? If they know how to make such a nice pancake---they should know to chop the menu in half, and make everything taste as good as this pancake! N.B. I tacked a third star up there just for that cake, if you don't order the cake, you are eating at a ** restaurant in my opinion.)"}
{"text":"YUMM!  they have a special breakfast menu that changes weekly.  have amazing buttermilk pancakes, french toast.. eggs..  arrive early on weekend as the place fills up and they may run out of a few special menu items   went with a group of 8 so had to wait for a while. but if you go with 2-4 ppl it should not be that long.   food is very fresh, n delicious."}
{"text":"The food is always wonderful.   The service is always top notch.   The only bad thing is the prices are high, but I hear they pay their staff more than other restaurants."}
{"text":"Mitzi's has a good rep but the wait for a table can be quite long and the service is hit or miss. I was once frowned upon for ordering a flavoured latte - like I need some waitress' scorn prior to my morning coffee...? Don't judge my vanilla loving ways!  Anyway the menu is always rotating, which means that that pork loin and creamy tarragon sauced omelet I once loved has never appeared on the menu again... still I appreciate a seasonal menu and there is always something that sounds good."}
{"text":"I felt I should like mitizi's. I like brunch, and my fab friend said he likes it there. He, being way more cool and stylish and in the know than me. But... I didn't love it.  It was fine. Me and two gentlemen friends went out for brunch on a Saturday morning. Arrived around 10:45 and had many indoor seats to choose from (the patio was full, but seeing many wasps bothering the patio people out the window, I was ok with our seats)  I ordered the scrambled eggs with brie and apples. It was alright. I tasted the cheese in the first mouthful, but not so much after. It was served on half a croissant, but scrambled eggs in this instance was a wet sort of dish, it was soggy. Didn't add to the meal. The fruit was nice, and the potatoes were fine. I wished I had some meat though (this is a frequent wish. In fact, I wish I had some meat right now!)  I'd try Mitzi's again. (Especially if I'm picked up in a fancy car like last weekend). But I don't know if I'd be the one to choose it.  $21 for breakfast and a tea with tax and tip"}
{"text":"I can see what all the fuss is about!  Great spot for brunch.  Service is amazing, cute and cozy interior, and a great location.  I love restaurants on a corner - all that extra light!  I had their infamous pancake.  I was expecting a standard pancake.  Oh, was I trumped and pleased by the flapjack of goodness that arrived before me.  This puppy was dense, moist, flavourful and very filling.  With the maple still glistening and the lavender on top making sweet love to my nose, I dove in.  Bless you Mitzi's for opening my mind up to a more oatmealy textured pancake.  It was fantastic!  As a person with a huge sweet tooth, I also absolutely loved their maple latte.  No Aunt Jemima knock off syrup in this stuff!  I think I should check for a maple tree out back!  It was too sweet for my buddy Chad B, but it was perfect pour moi.    I will be back to try all the menu.  I may even stop by and have just the latte....it was that good!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great.  Upon entering, I was told that there was going to be about a 40-minute wait. This was to be expected. Toronto has this voraciousness for brunch that I will never understand. I usually spend my Sunday mornings with my face firmly implanted into my pillow, but to each their own.  When we got seated, we got fresh OJ (very good and worth the $3) and I was told that the French Toast was dairy free when I mentioned I was allergic to dairy. When it came, it had a big dollop of whipped cream on the side, which I brushed off the plate. By this time I was super hungry and couldn't  wait for a new plate. The french toast was pretty good, but nothing special. It wasn't any better than what I could make at home. My friend had the poached eggs with polenta and a side of bacon. She didn't seem all too impressed, either. In fact, at one point she mentioned the place we SHOULD have gone to instead, and that definitely had the breakfast sausages she was craving.  All in all, the food wasn't bad, but it was overpriced. The service was pretty good, but something was lost between informing the server about the dairy allergy and getting my food. In my opinion, this place wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great gourmet brunch with homestyle flair. The hipster feeling is interesting also.   I wouldn't say that their pancakes are as good as Insomnia's but they are very similar.  Will be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Best French Toast I've had in quite awhile. It's a bit pricey ($12.50) and a total diet buster, but worth every penny and every minute you'll spend on a treadmill in penitence."}
{"text":"Almost a year later and I'm back, baby!   So, what was on today's platter? WELL, thanks for asking! Between three people, it consisted of the...  - Omelette Special:  with butter chicken, mango chutney and paneer. $13.95  - French Toast: topped with a butter tart and toasted pecans. Served with pure maple syrup & fresh whipped cream. $13.75 - Pesto Club: triple Decker with bacon, chicken, lettuce, tomato, garlic mayo and homemade pesto. Choice of sourdough or rye bread. $10.75  Best was the Pesto Club - that was a real beauty, accompanied appropriately with a side of home fries and a fresh salad. Nom. The French toast and omelette special were tied: French toast was plentiful (three thick and sweet slabs) though I'm not sure if I liked the experience of being able to chew the granular sugar... On the other hand, the omelette was interesting - fluffy but a bit tasteless.   I wish Mitzi's would be more generous with their fruit. Three thin slices, :( C'mon. However, their mains do have generous portions so, I suppose that balances out. I shared these dishes with my two companions and, truthfully, I don't think I'm going to be needing dinner. (I waddled back home.)  I'm in agreement with the general tone with Mitzi's - their prices aren't great but man, the convenience, the pretty good food, the lovely interior is what brought me back.   ...I'm coming back for their Buttermilk Oatmeal Pancake!! (Shameless.)"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and should probably hit up this place a couple more times before reviewing, but here we go...  So I've heard of Mitzi's a lot from friends as a good place for brunch. I'm usually in the area so decided to check it out and wasn't very impressed. The actual restaurant is sort of bland-looking. It doesn't really have the character I like in a brunch spot. I like a cozy atmosphere but Mitzi's seems bare and had some very uninteresting portraits on the wall.  The food... I ordered an omelette which came with spicy potatoes, some questionable fruit slices and two pieces of toast. This cost 14 dollars! And the omelette wasn't anything special: it lacked cheese and flavour. I did end up getting a banana/orange juice which was actually quite good -- nice and thick with a great taste.  Our waitress was nice though. Service was fast but we never got asked for a coffee refill, which I am picky about. Usually I am hungover and groggy if I am eating brunch and I need lots of coffee. Anyway, the place seems nice and I will check it out again sometime, but the ho-hum food and somewhat high price makes me skeptical."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriends one Sunday afternoon. This place will take a long time to serve your food - as it took them almost an hour to give us our food. So make sure you give yourself lots of time! It is definitely a lazy brunch place!  Definitely recommend the pancakes! Beware of the portion sizes - they are huge!"}
{"text":"I've been here four times in the first week.  Pricey for brunch, but you can't argue with guaranteed quality.   Place has been packed on the weekends, but with ample table space and a good sized patio, it's no worries.  Service is top notch.   It's rare that three minutes goes by without them topping off your coffee.   The overcaffination makes life better.  Based on the looks of things so far, the place seems to be somewhat of a local celebrity hotspot.   Lots of beautiful people eating delicious breakfast.    Rumour is that they're going to open for dinner pretty soon."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the famous Mitzi's location on Sorauren Ave., dreading the line-up, but craving a delicious brunch, when we drove by a sign just past Ossington that read: Mitzi's On College.  I don't think I have ever pulled over so quickly.    We had heard rumours of this additional location, but we weren't sure when it was opening.  It turned out that it was only their second day in operation.  The interior was not as homey as the original Mitzi's, with their collection of vintage kitchen tables, but the same prints by a local artist hung on the walls.  The entire layout was more hip, more minimalist, more \"College St.\", with a definite touched-by-an-interior designer feel.  The menu was brought to us printed out on white paper.  We were used to peering up at the blackboard at Mitzi's for the day's menu, as it changes all the time.  I'm not yet sure if this new Mitzi's will follow the same system, but I can't imagine they wouldn't.  Half the fun is anticipating what amazing combinations and flavours will be available for brunch next weekend.  I ordered the oatmeal buttermilk pancake, with fresh cream, blueberries, pernod custard, and the usual spiced potatoes and garnish fruit.  I would never order pancakes normally, but I decided to be adventurous.  I don't generally enjoy pancakes, and I find them heavy and bland, but the aforementioned description of the dish sounded too good to pass up.  I am so glad I didn't.  I have never enjoyed a meal at Mitzi's more than I did that day.  I always ordered French Toast, or Poached Eggs, or something with lentils and Indian spices, and while they were rave-worthy dishes in the past, they were now put to shame by the oatmeal pancake.  It was so moist, light, and delicious, it barely needed the cream or custard.  That being said, the Pernod custard complimented the fresh blueberries so unbelievably well.  Every bite was perfect!  The wait-staff was incredibly polite and friendly, and we still received our coffee in eclectic mismatched mugs.  I loved all the flower boxes surrounding the patio. I know it won't be long 'til we're waiting in line-ups at this location as well.  It's just fantastic having a Mitzi's so much closer to home."}
{"text":"i consider myself something of a brunch connoisseur, & this place served up maybe the best omelette (okay, i consider myself an omelette connoisseur, too) i've had in ages. maybe i'm a little biased because it contained every single ingredient i would include in my top 5 list (at the time it was peach compote, roasted chicken & cheddar), but hey! red-skin potatoes! & sourdough toast as a default bread? you're killin' me here. the young irish couple serving my wife & i even bought us a round of mimosas to congratulate us on our still fresh nuptials! can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is hipster-central. To borrow a joke from Christian Lander: you cannot swing a canvas bag at a Mitzi's on College without hitting a hipster. But that's cool because hipsters are excellent fellow diners because they don't make too much noise. I love the way this resto looks inside, I always feel gleeful when i walk through the door. I've come here with large groups and they are always accommodating. Not like the eye-roll you'd get at other hipster establishments. Mitzi's servers are ready to deal with allergies, 20 questions about a menu item, and finnicky kids in the most pleasant way possible.  I've only ever been for their no-bullshit brunch. I love how they have rotating takes on a set of dishes. I still haven't decided if I'm a savoury or sweet breakfast person and Mitzi's makes a convincing case for both sides. The pancake is always phe-nom-en-al. It's usually smothered in some sort of fruit compote and a maple syrup infusion type thing. If the ingredients in the daily omelette or scramble pique your interest though, order it. You will not be disappointed. Most dishes come with  of fresh fruit slices, toast and home fries. This place gets extra points for putting hot sauce on the table with the ketchup."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop in at the new Mitzi's on a whim one afternoon, but when we got there, were informed that they were just closing (it was about 4pm). We said we'd have to come by another time and left - but a few steps out the door, the waitress caught up to us and said they could still take us. It was only their second day open, and the cook didn't mind staying a bit longer.  It was simply fantastic. The waitress and cook were both friendly, and came over frequently to check on us. We felt bad for making them stay late, but they seemed perfectly happy to accommodate us.  We stopped feeling so apologetic when we got our breakfast sandwiches. Oh my, were they glorious. Eating one, you can't help feeling anything but elation. Toasted multigrain sourdough with a light garlic spread, fried eggs, bacon and kimchi. The marriage of tangy orange cabbage and eggs is a revelation. We had sauce dripping down our wrists in no time.  It is a bit pricey - the sandwiches were around 10$ each, but the quality of the food and the staff more than makes up for it (as does the lovely patio). I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Soup great, food was super, healthy and down right freaking delicous! Staff was helpful with choices, vegan and home cooked feel.  Atmosphere was cosy, lots of local art. Which is great, wonderful showcase of some fantastic artist. Second location also does bands... Brillant..."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot, a welcome addition to the neighbourhood.  The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant is spacious, with cheerful modern decor and the tables are well spaced apart so that you aren't on top of each other.  Menu is on the pricey side.  $13 and change is a bit expensive for french toast or a pancake, but as noted by other reviewers the quality is there.  I got the bacon and eggs... Bacon and eggs ($7.25) were standard, the toast was EXCELLENT (multi-grain or sourdough) and the potatoes were very nice as well.  Service was pleasant and capable, though I didn't get the same experience as Daniel B regarding the coffee... had to ask a couple of times to get my coffee refilled during the meal.  But then asked a couple of times after that if I wanted my coffee refilled... so I guess they redeemed themselves.  Appreciated the fact that we weren't pushed to leave as it was raining outside and we did linger a fairly long time after settling the bill."}
{"text":"Living at Duffrin and Bloor, I'm hard pressed to find a great all day breakfast within a 10 min bike ride of my house. Enter Mitzi's on College last summer. This place has become my defacto, hangover cure/impress the suburban friends/study+eat spot.  The secret with Mitzi's is to order the basic breakfast, it's under 8 bucks, and you will be stuffed by the flavorful home fries, smoked bacon, mountain of fresh fruit, eggs and hearty home made sourdough or multi-grain toast. And the coffee isn't half bad either. The trick is, on the weekends it's not on the menu, so if you're a week away from payday, and still want to eat a nice meal early in the day without the hassle of doing dishes, head to Mitzi's on College order a coffee and ask for 'the breakfast' - you won't be disappointed.  The other standout for dishes that this place has welded to my heart, is their oatmeal pancake... wow. I'm not a sweets-in-the-morning type of person, but one of my friends ordered this a few months ago, and I've since ordered it probably a half dozen times. Hearty but not nauseatingly sweet and batter-y, served with loads of fruit. Delicious.  Besides the open, bright atmosphere, patio in the summer, and location, they have art on display from local artists, and the staff that work here are all friendly and conscientious, and recognized me after only a few visits.  If you live in the Bloor-court Village, follow your hunch don't waste your time with the rest, Mitzi's is brunch."}
{"text":"Man, oh man, was I excited that Mitzi's opened up within bicycling distance. When I went to Mitzi's on Soraren it was one of the most epic brunches I've had in the city and I was expecting the same experience, minus the TTC fare thrown in.  My friend and I showed up on a Tuesday afternoon and it was packed! We had to wait, and wait we did, maybe 20 minutes. We were served drinks while we waited, which was nice, but when we were seated, they forget to give us menus and drinks. Not impressed.  After getting menus, my friend went with some meat and horseradish sandwich and I opted for the Mexican poached eggs and added fruit and toast to it. Disappointing on my end, but my friend had a field day with her sandwich.  First off, I got a bowl of black bean soup - which I like - with two poached eggs in it. This was not what I was expecting. And considering I added toast and fruit for an additional five bucks or so, I got two slices of melon and a petite cut of pineapple. The potatoes were good, I guess, as was the toast, but what I could have really gone for was a salad. This was carbs to the extreme and not worth the price.  Sure, the place is cute, and yeah, it's around Ossington, the new hot spot, and the menu reads well, but I don't really have any intention of going back. A shame, because I am a serious bruncher."}
{"text":"This little place is cozy, comfy and VERY reasonably priced.   Our waitress was the only one working on a Saturday evening, and she was wicked good. She was on top of everything and extremely calm. I don't know her name, but she's irish and has long dark hair and if you get her you're a lucky lady or lad.   I had the chicken tenders with the house salad, they were delicious but I was jealous of my buddy Jennica (that's halfway between Jennifer and Jessica) and her burger. I've heard great things about their burgers and next time I'll be smarter and get one."}
