{"text":"This place is a great little joint for lunch. The patio is sweet in the summer. The daily specials are usually awesome (but watch out for crazy high prices on some of them). The pizza is very tasty traditional-like, and the fish and chips are always a good size. The sandwiches always taste fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to The Liberty several times. Tucked in the heart of Liberty Village, this cool resto has a great lofty feel to it and the food/rinks are decent too. They also offer live jazzy music nights.  My now-husband and I held our engagement party here 2 years ago and the management really went out of its way to accommodate our needs. It was a great experince. I used to go here now and then for brunch and dinner but it seems that they've changed their chefs a couple of times and it's not quite the same. Some of my favourite food items, like a breakfast potato hash with the poached eggs - are no longer offered on the menu. ;( It's still a nice place to go for a drink on the patio in the summer and a little appetizer or to celebrate a b-day dinner.  The Liberty is quite elegant so it's always a little odd when those 'crazed' TFC fans pop in for some beer and grub before and after the soccer matches. Guess it helps keep the place afloat."}
{"text":"I have lived in Liberty for about 5 months now and every time I walk by this place, I try to mentally gauge whats it all about? Coffee Shop with food, restaurant, bar? what is it?  Finally, the questioning was overtaking me, It was a usual Saturday morning, I was feeling super lazy and had no will for any effort. So I decided to hunt for some grub, Intrigued by their Brunch sign I decided to give it a go.  Food: Had a nice little breakfast to myself, great eggs, bacon and sausage.  Home Fries were delicious - half sweet potato - half regular - mixed in with some red pepper. It was awesome! All of this with a fresh cappuccino.  I'm sold!  Ambiance: Like I said, from the outside, you are never really sure what it is. but inside it all seems to make sense. Its really laid back and casual with a slight Italian flare. very slight.  Sauce Factor: I don't think I can describe it any better - but Heinz and Egg Yolk from my Over Easy eggs. Bomb!  Would love to come back and try the lunch or dinner menus."}
{"text":"This place is unexpected. Doesn't look that appealing from the outside. From the inside, is cozy, well decorated and the staff is very friendly!   I had a delicious meal and a couple of great Caesars. Can't recommend enough.   They have jazz nights and I'm eagerly waiting for their patio season."}
{"text":"Three friends and I went for supper there tonight before a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Building.  There were two other tables besides ours.  I ordered Spaghetti w/Italian Sausage (roasted red peppers in a tomato sauce).  It was so-so. The sausage was warm and the pasta was hot.   My husband ordered a burger and fries which was good.  The servers were a bit snotty."}
