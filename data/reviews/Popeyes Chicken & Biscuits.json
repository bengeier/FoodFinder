{"text":"We ordered 12 piece dinner and got 3/4 of it in wings and legs the size of cornish game hens legs and wings. It was pretty sad. Very disappointed from usual standards. Must be under new management"}
{"text":"Extremely good chicken. I enjoy the food here and try to come here anytime I'm near the base. I will say that that the line moves super slow on weekdays and sometimes get really long. However, this is usually balanced with excellent service and quick food delivery upon ordering."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this location on Thursday, March 31st for lunch. We were on the base at the AirForce BX, so we stopped at the food court to eat lunch. We have been to this Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits many times in the past. We always enjoy friendly, fast service at this location. The chicken is always fresh and hot and the sides are good as well. 
This Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits  is located in the food court outside of the AirForce BX. It is very busy, as a lot of people like Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits and identify with its brand and what it represents: Louisiana Cajun style fried chicken. You can have your chicken mildly or spicy seasoned. Right now they have a big box for $5.00. (You can add a drink for $1.50) Included are two pieces of chicken, a biscuit, and two sides. I think this is a good value for what you get.
We will be return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"This Popeye's on the property of Luke Air Force Base.  I came here with my brother, who is a retired Air Force Vet.

The service is friendly and the staff works to get the orders out in good time.  They seem to keep a steady stream of hungry customers.

The chicken is pretty good, comparable to others in the chain!  We get both original and spicy chicken.  The spicy one is not very spicy, it just adds a little zing.  The chicken is crispy on the outside and tender inside.  We've gotten the mashed potatoes and red beans & rice... both of which are good accompaniments! 

There is plenty of seating in the area.  The seating is for all the food restaurants in this Food Court.  But, since we take it home, we haven't sat there yet.  I'm not sure who is in charge of cleanup, but it is kept clean.

If you have access to entering the AFB, consider some food from Popeye's!"}
