{"text":"This is my first Yelp review..

The hotel is under construction so a little shabby - however, the 5 stars is 100% attributed to the staff and mainly ROCCO at the white horse tavern bar (attached to the hotel). 

Rocco is AMAZING - he is the reason i stay here week over week! He is friendly, personable and a damn fine bartender. 

To Management - give this guy a raise! I'm a platinum SPG member and have been for years... he is the main reason i ever stay at this hotel!"}
{"text":"Omg this Hotel lets child sport tournaments stay there and let the children run amok do not at any point attempt to keep the children calm while the parents are drunk in the bar.  The linens were dirty with makeup and hair, the bathtub was not cleaned and the whirlpool tub did not work. The toilet did not flush and there was  trash on the floor.  Our original reservation was for a club floor suite with a king and a whirlpool tub not the room they stuck us in. The bathroom was extremely small you had to shut the door to even get into the bathtub.  Not what we expected from the Sheraton will never stay at this hotel travelers beware . The staff was really nice and polite but unless they stop letting tournaments stay there I would suggest not staying at this hotel or calling ahead to see if there's a tournament staying there. if there is stay at your own peril.  My advice to the hotel is to keep all of the guests with kids that are attending the tournaments on the first floor or stiffen up the rules for the tournaments and enforce the rules. I expect more for how expensive it is per night"}
{"text":"Meeting & ball room are horrible for holding meeting of large groups. Sound quality is very bad, they had cold air on in middle of November. Staff loud right outside of the meeting room making the sound issue worse. Food was so so."}
{"text":"The room was beautiful and clean but loud. The smoke alarm was chirping when we arrived and we had to wait to have it repaired. 

The walls were very thin and we heard every word said outside our room. 

There was a party in the club when we arrived and lots of activity going on in the hall and lobby in the morning. 

The elevator was near our room and we had to listen to the mechanical sounds ALL NIGHT long."}
{"text":"I stayed here because I was doing business at QVC which is in West Chester. i gave the hotel 5 stars because my entire stay from the time I walked into the hotel to the time I left was perfect. They had a free shuttle to QVC and I believe anywhere else in town within a 5 mile radius. My room was fantastic! I stayed in 204. Lovely suite. The bed was very comfortable.  I can tell it had been remodeled since many previous reviews mentioned how outdated the rooms were. I believe the entire hotel (mostly) has been renovated. The main restaurant was closed for renovations and the elevators still looked old so they aren't quite done. The workout room was fully complete with weights and cardio equipment. They had 3 treadmills (Life Fitness brand) and two stationery bikes (one is a recumbent) as well as a couple of ellipticals. There was a separate area for stretching. They have a pool but i didn't use it.

For breakfast, the hotel restaurant actually had steel cut oats! Typically hotels only offer regular oatmeal. It was made perfectly! I didn't eat there for dinner. I went next door to Outback :) 

Thanks to the staff because they were very friendly, even at 3:30 am when I had to check out."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed my stays at this Sheraton.  The staff here were very friendly and helpful.  While the decor seems a little dated, the building and grounds are very clean and well kept.  

If you go to the bar for a drink, try to score a small basket of their very yummy homemade potato chips ... they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Hotel is nice and clean but they do not accommodate requests like Microwave in the room even if you are a regular visitor. I stay here almost every week for work related reasons and yet I have to go down to the lobby to use Microwave."}
{"text":"I'm a loyal starwood member and travel quite a bit for work.  I've stayed here twice and its about the best option in the area.  The hotel does need a face lift, but the best thing about this hotel is the bartender Jimmy.  Super nice guy, makes great drinks, knows most everyone by name even if they don't visit often.  Definitely stop by to see him if you are staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"I got bed bugs here late last year, which was confirmed by a doctor I saw. 3-4 calls/messages I put in with hotel management went unanswered, only to find out later when I called SPG that they had closed the case without ever contacting me.

The gym at this hotel needs a serious makeover - not just modernized but fixed. All 3 elliptical  machines and 2 of the 3 treadmills have non-responsive screens - both of which have remained that way for over 4 months when I first made the staff aware.

It's a shame this property isn't in better shape, it's in an ideal location but I know several people who choose instead to stay 15 minutes further away at the next closest SPG."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff that works here. The rooms are super nice with amazing pillows. I wish the wireless wasn't so expensive, there was more snack foods available, but the place has an accessible bar atleast."}
{"text":"Stayed on the 5th floor club level over the weekend and everything was clean. Nice room with a clean bath. Appreciated that it was quiet, and the staff was friendly. Daughter played in a field hockey tournament at nearby sports facility - easy 15 minute drive. Good breakfast - staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"So much potential but this pretty property on top of a hill falls short of wowing me, after 2 multiple-day visits. It's just OK. As someone reviewing this Sheraton has noted, everything starts off as a 3 and gets adjusted up or down from there. I'm leaving it a 3 but no better, because it had some good elements (nice chill patio, bar/restaurant from circa 1715), but some bad as well: shuttered restaurant, completely mediocre/typical breakfast buffet and poorly trained foodservice employees wearing shabby and really dirty clothing while they served us breakfast. The place is in need of long-term employees.

Rooms were meh all the way (bathrooms are just too small, everything throughout seemed worn, loose, and dated). I tried this place twice but it did not live up to a 4 star experience, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Place was pretty dumpy. The decor is outdated. The air conditioning in the lobby and bar was not working when it was almost 100 degrees outside. I was given a handicap room even though I am not handicapped. Pool was not open 5 out of the 6 days I was there. Fitness room was moved into a conference room due to construction. Very disappointing. They have really let this property go."}
{"text":"It's not really my style to write bad reviews, because I've spent enough time working in the service industry to know how hard it is to get things perfect every time.  However, when my experience is terrible, I feel compelled to steer others away so they don't waste their time and money.
The list of issues below is indeed 'nit-picky'; once things started going poorly, it was hard to not notice everything that wrong with this hotel.  I assure you, we didn't start our trip looking for these problems.  Generally speaking, this hotel is dingy and poorly maintained.
Our experience:
We called to confirm our room was ready for a 3pm check-in (their standard time) and told that, indeed, check in was 3pm.  Apparently, the person we spoke with didn't actually check to see if our room was ready, because when we arrived at 4pm, our room was not available.  They provided us with vouchers for breakfast for the inconvenience.  Unfortunately, they didn't even get this right, because the vouchers were apparently for 2 nights free stay (which we didn't expect), but their inability to even get this right added to our concern.
The hotel was apparently booked for a high school sports event.  Clearly, hotel management must have been aware of this.  Unfortunately, they didn't do anything to address mess and noise issues related to having dozens of high schoolers running around.  We ended up calling the front desk twice because we were woken up.  There was no apology from anyone and it didn't appear they did anything.
The list of other issues; again, not meant to be obsessive, but to illustrate management's lack of attention and failure to maintain their hotel.
* shower head loose
* ice machine leaking with towels on floor to soak up water
* no sheers on windows (blackout curtain only)
* all lamps mismatched
* make-up mirror loose
* spray paint all over ceiling tiles in bathroom
* scrapes on doors
* 15W hall light insufficient
* jacuzzi tub wasn't working (given how dirty things were, we realized we probably didn't want to use it anyway)
* AC only had on/off functionality, so it was either blasting cold air or off.  Given the noise issues we had, some background noise would have been nice to have.
* rust on tiles in bathroom"}
{"text":"Literally a roach motel. LITERALLY!! Roaches on the heating unit (which the maintenance people will explain as \"seasonal bugs\"). And noisy as heck. Stay here if you want to hear the road noise from the interstate, all activity in the room next to you, the hallway noise, and the crappiest most expensive breakfast available (with nasty servers)."}
{"text":"I came to this hotel for a wedding, so it was really picked for me in a block of rooms.  The location is great if you are heading to the outlets or QVC, which I hear some people go to for shopping (LOL). The staff at the front desk were very friendly. The rooms were nice, clean and bed very comfy...The bar area was nice, jam packed but we enjoyed ourselves. I didnt see a lot of hotels in the area but if you need one in this area I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Upon checking in on August 1, 2016, front office staff was courteous and friendly and we were given our keys within 3 minutes. 

At the business club lounge, despite a 930am end of the free breakfast, and it was already 10am, a special callout to Shakira, who allowed us to help ourselves to the eggs and bacon. 

She even got us plates and cutlery and even had a friendly chat. She was working hard to keep the kitchenette there clean. A great staffer and deserving of the Sheraton standard. 

Free parking and there's a side entrance, so you can enter the stairwell to your room -- without having to go through the lobby."}
{"text":"Having been Starwood Platinum for the last few years, I can say that this Sheraton is above average.  My accommodations were recently renovated, comfortable, clean and quiet.  The club lounge was fine - I honestly didn't think it was remarkable one or another as compared to other reviews - the mere fact that there was a clubs level was very nice.

Great value adds in the lobby were the huge bowls of Hershey kisses and miniatures as well as the spa water.  The hotel was excellent for both business and pleasure.  I would stay again and would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Platinum member, so we've been to a lot of Sheratons it was a fine hotel with better than average service.

#1 for hospitality - every single staff member we came in contact with was friendly and service oriented.  Tuesday nights they have guest appreciation meet and greet with free food and free drinks.  We met some nice folks and had our fill.  The Club staff was very friendly too and this club serves free alcohol.  

Accommodations:  Newly renovated, clean, we had a giant spa tub in our room.  Only complaint is their keys kept not working on various doors.  Three times in one day once.  But the staff was so helpful and apologetic, it was easy to be forgiving.

For a smaller Sheraton in the suburbs it was about what we expected which was average.  What put this hotel over the top was the people.

BTW:  We also stayed at Sheraton Valley Forge which is a bigger, fancier hotel in a nice area close by.  BUT this Club rocked compared.  The food was far better, staff friendlier, and there was no free wine at the other one."}
{"text":"First off, the welcome to the hotel was tepid, at best. There was a guy at the counter who was more impressed with the attractive blonde who had ALREADY checked in, but kept coming back for things for the guy to get her, while everyone else waited. Other front desk people were busy doing... something. Never figured out what. Finally a young woman came over to check me in. She had an interesting accent, which I couldn't place, and was at times hard to understand, but overall, she was good at her job. The room... hmmmm... sketchy is a good word. Dated decor, thin walls (I was watching food network and someone pounded on the wall to get me to turn it down. It was already at low volume, and it was food network... not a reconstruction of the Sharon Tate Murder case... Back to the review... the fascia on the tub was peeling back from the tub; the shower curtain did not reach all the way across the tub; there were sketchy hairs on the counter and in the tub. Bring lysol if you decide to stay here. I also had to call for towels. I was there for only one night, so I could deal. What I could NOT deal with was the lack of internet connectivity. They tell you upon check-in that there is free internet in the lobby/bar/restaurant. What they FAIL to tell you is it is restricted. You can only access Sheraton pages free of charge. Browsing at leisure carries a $12.95 surcharge for 24 hours. FAIL. I can get free internet in a 1-star hotel! I will be back in the area, but will stay across the parking lot at a competing hotel chain. I will say the service at the bar was excellent. I ordered an appetizer, which was very bad, but being hungry I ate it anyway. There were two wedding parties at this hotel the weekend I was there. I feel VERY sorry for the wedding party and guests. The lobby had overflowing trashcans, and something wet on the floor. The lobby restroom was a huge mess: paper towels everywhere, water on the floor, toilet didn't flush... Unless this is the only choice you have, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Where do I begin to describe the experience of Hotel Hell? We used this hotel as accomodations for out of town guests for my son and daughter in law's wedding. There were a multitude of problems with the reservation system. They didn't have rooms (when a groomsman booked on a travel website he was able to find a room). They didn't allow rooms booked past a given date when, in fact, my DinL had it in writing that guests could book up until the date of the wedding. When the bride and her bridesmaids went to check in on Friday night, they had no rooms, as apparently a Kardashian entourage was given an entire floor including the bridal suite promised to my son and DinL. To make matters worse, father of the bride waited over an hour for lunch that the server FORGOT to put the order in for, making him late for the wedding rehearsal and they were not even comped! It gets worse....the happy couple's credit card was TRIPLE charged for their room, which was not even the one promised. The bride stormed down to the desk in tears with her hair done/veil on to complain. They then had no money to start their honeymoon. NOT how one's wedding day is supposed to be. There were multiple wedding parties in this hotel this weekend, I saw at least 4 brides and I can only hope they were not treated as shabbily as we were."}
{"text":"Great hotel in the West Chester area!  Friendly staff, nice rooms and convenient location.  The Club Room is very nice and offers a continental breakfast and an evening spread too.  I used to stay at this hotel frequently when I was coming to PA for work quite a bit.  This will continue to be my go to hotel when visiting this area."}
{"text":"Traveling to the Exton area for work is becoming common for myself. We usually stay at the Hilton  Garden Inn but this time we stayed here. Sadly it didn't live up to expectations. 

Upon check-in, there was only 1 computer working and 1 flustered employee. After waiting a bit, I was given my key and confirmed I would be staying 5 nights. Nope-only 4. I'm not sure what the mix up was on that. Anyway, off to the room. 

Located on the 5th floor, I was told about the manager's happy hour and complimentary breakfast and the benefits that come with that. Fast forward to 530 and I enter the area where the happy hour is located. The employee is sitting in a corner playing with her phone. She didn't stand up to greet me or ask if I needed anything-just pecking away on her phone. This wasn't a really great first impression, but none the less, they did have free wine and some munchies. 

Once in the room, I connected to wi-fi but it was way too slow and wouldn't connect, so I had to switch to cellular....another negative. 

The room is ok-no mini fridge and the bathroom is tiny but it will do. 

One of the phones didn't  work, and I found a dead stink bug in the AC vent. I did call front desk and they sent maintenance up to fix it (but the phone still didn't work, but it wasn't that big of a deal).  

While resting for a second, my door opens up. The house keeping supervisor didn't realize the room was already occupied. It's a good thing I wasn't changing or in the shower, but it did remind me that I needed to put the extra deadbolt on the door for the rest of the stay. 

Later on in the day, I went to order room service but there was no menu so I called room service to have a menu sent to me. I was told to call the front desk, which I did but was told to call back to room service. Quite annoying and honestly someone should have taken ownership and brought me a menu. Or at least they should have transferred me instead of having me hang up and call back. I never ended up ordering room service due to this dilemma. 

Later in the evening, I went to flush the toilet only to find that it was clogged and overflowing!  When does this end? 

The next morning I helped myself to the complimentary breakfast that consisted of warm yogurt, Danish and powdery eggs. The saving grace was the cappuccino/espresso machine. Unfortunately the machine wasn't working (the display said ADD WATER).  The employee who was working said that we would have to wait until the evening to get it fixed. Hmmm....my co-worker had to show her how to add water.  

On Wednesday evening, they had the Happy Hour in the hotel lobby and it was much better. The young lady who they have hired to help bring in brides/grooms to the hotel was extremely friendly and seemed to really care about the feedback we were giving. 

Two of the nights we were there, our trainer had set up a room for us to have a study session. Both nights, we were told to go to the incorrect room. Not a huge deal, but showed the lack of communication and an area of opportunity for this hotel to work on. 

I will say that Tony, the shuttle driver, was extremely friendly and was very accommodating. Even to the point he has a little step stool to help you get in and out of the shuttle. This was a nice touch to my stay. 

Would I stay here again?  Probably not. The staff needs to be trained on customer service, the bones of the building need to be upgraded and the food needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"There's not much positive to say, except that the lobby/restaurant area has been redone and is beautiful. I very rarely write reviews, but have stayed here a few times over the past year, each time having an issue but hoping it was a fluke. Well, third times the charm and I will not be returning. The young restaurant manager(s?) do little to nothing at all except loop the hotel in suits and complain loudly to any employee within earshot about their jobs, their bosses, the employees, whatever. I've seen both bark orders at restaurant/bar staff with absolutely no couth, obviously in front of customers such as myself. One older man who I believe claimed to have worked in the sales department came down to the bar one night loudly professing his political views to the entirety of the lobby area, possibly whilst drunk, and complete with multiple, colorful curse words, etc. Phone didn't work in the room once, refrigerator smelled once, billing error twice. Aside from the aesthetics of this place, it is a nightmare and a complete shame."}
{"text":"Very clean and updated.  Bed was comfortable.  The pictures in the room were awkward (just 4 random pictures in a square in the room) but maybe that's a new style thing.  Nice sized pool
Elevators were slow..so i took the stairs all the time.  Not sure if that's a con for my health though.  Chair in the room was ungodly uncomfortable but you are in a hotel....if your destination is this hotel...you might want to rethink your hobby list.
Major complaint....for the price....no free breakfast.   Not even a bagel or a croissant or Fruit Loops.  Free coffee in the room though."}
{"text":"I'm a platinum starwood member and thought the hotel was up to par.  Nothing amazing, but was exactly as expected.  Clean, upgraded room on the club floor and an updated and larger gym.  Great location, just off the highway and near a few good restaurants.  Great for work travel, very close to my office."}
{"text":"The staff really went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible. My group was both large and unique in some its needs. Every single member of the staff really shined on one or more separate occasions in taking care of my group. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This is one of a few hotels near QVC & it is the BEST choice if you're traveling to the area for business. Overall it's pretty average, but it does the basics well: 

Cleanliness=4 stars. My room has always been clean. One time it was missing a few towels, which was kind of odd. 
Friendliness of staff=5 stars.  The staff are so friendly. I had a ten minute conversation with one of the staff during breakfast and when you're traveling for work and overtired that makes such a difference in your mood. 
Food/Room Service=The food is pretty good overall. The breakfast buffet has quite the selection w/ a chef making custom omelet station. Room service has always been prompt, with a decent selection. 
Bar=bartender went above and beyond one night by sticking around and serving a few of us night owls.

They have an indoor poor that looks really nice, but alas I've always been working so I haven't had a chance to check it out."}
{"text":"I love that I'm the second person to write a review about the Sheraton/wedding disaster situation from this weekend (AND I'm from a different bridal party).  There were at least 4 wedding parties staying there and I heard a bunch of complaints.

We were told the bride had the \"Bridal Suite\"; we went to check in and the room was a regular suite, frankly very small size for a bridal party to get ready in but fine.  More importantly, the curtains over the windows were caked in dust.  

I had huge issues checking in the day of the wedding, they refused to call me when a room was available and insisted I keep checking back even though I was in the hotel already and trying to get hair and makeup done before the wedding.  I stayed at two other hotels earlier in the week and neither had any problem letting me try to check in early.  

We ordered breakfast from room service, the eggs tasted like plastic and they didn't bring butter or jam or anything for the toast.  $60 breakfast for two people and it was awful.  

Along with another wedding, we headed to the bar for an after party.  The bartenders were AWFUL.  I get that it was busy but we've all been to busy bars before and there is no need to be plain rude.  

We had a great wedding but I would never go back to this hotel."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE! SHEKRA! Omg she is EVERYTHING SHE gave me the best service! took care of me during happy hour. I have worked customer service and SHE takes the cake!!!! You can tell she loves what she does. She made me feel like home while treating me with the utmost respect! I was here on business and exhausted she made me laugh! 
Jeff at the front desk was such a professional, sweet gentlemen. I love this place! Honestly recommend if you are looking for a low key sweet place to relax! AND THEY HAVE HAPPPY HR until 7:30pm! WILL BE BACK!! SWEET AMAZING PLACE!"}
{"text":"If you need to come to this area, you are pretty limited in terms of hotels. You have this and the Hampton inn right across the way. I've stayed at many Sheratons and this is unlike any, but not in a good way. It's pretty dated and could use an overhaul. The staff is always very nice though and it's conveniently located by an Outback. There is also a restaurant in the hotel, but the hotel doesn't have 24 hour room service. During my last stay, the first room that I was given didn't have a working toilet, but the staff quickly moved my room to one that was fully functional. I'll stay here again if I need to come to the area, but I'm crossing my fingers hoping for some updates on the hotel before I return."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars for a number of reasons.  The second time I checked in here this year, there was a young gentleman who was New and in training.  His attention to detail was the best I've seen.  He was conscientious.  Better yet, he was genuine.  Nothing rubs me wrong like a phony maitre d', hostess, clerk or server.  This fellow was phenomenal.

The rooms were clean.  The housecleaning staff is severely understaffed, especially on the weekends.  But, when they finally come around they do a thorough cleaning.  I have my ways of testing to measure this.  

I was most appreciative of the staff they had working the Club Lounge.  I don't know why, but invariably all the executive lounges for Hilton, Sheraton and the like, are manned by a fascist disagreeable woman who hovers over you and comes behind you and generally makes you feel as if you don't belong.  Having had worked in the service industry throughout high school and my undergrad years, I know how to give proper service.  I'm also overly empathetic and spend more time cleaning up after myself than I should.  But truth be told, I should not be made to feel aware of the help.  I shouldn't be made hyper aware of myself either.  Suffice it to say that I was able to come here and relax and leave happy.

Finally, there is the deck.  There's some other areas outside the indoor pool that I was making a mental note of to come and have a cigar at after dinner.  But, I ended up on the deck.  It's sheltered, yet outdoors.  There's plenty of seating, fire pits and even music and lighting.  This was the spot in the evening."}
{"text":"My friend and I stayed at the hotel over Easter and we couldn't have been happier with our stay. I called down to the front desk to see where the vending machine was and was told they didn't have one. Minutes later the front desk manager Jasmine was at my door with a room full of sodas and a key card to breakfast bar on the fifth floor. That really made a difference. Would definitely go back there and stay."}
{"text":"In came into town for a work function and stayed at the Sheraton for two nights. This time, I stayed on the club level, thanks to my work. This review is from a newbie to the upper level of hotels, from an outsider type standpoint, as this was my first time on club level. 

Check in was fast and easy. Gentleman who was greeting guests was more than accommodating and friendly. 

We visited the lounge area after we checked in and got settled. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She wanted to make sure my group was comfortable and she was super polite. Breakfast was a similar experience. 

The room left a lot to be desired, considering it was a club level room. I had imagined it a bit more luscious, although for me, the room was fine. I do suggest to the staff to fix the peeling wall paper, make sure times on the clocks are correct, take care of any mold issues, make sure the toilet flushes, touch up any peeling paint, and if a lamp shade is damaged or dirty, just change it. I understand some of these things in a lower tier hotel, but club level at the Sheraton? 

I always enjoy my stay here regardless of what floor I'm on. The rooms are comfortable. People are friendly. Rooms are generally clean. Those are the things that matter."}
{"text":"FTR, huh?  well I can't say I am surprised.  As hotels go, this place is really nothing special.  I stay here when I am in town on business solely to rack up the points.  The rooms are average, the bar is average.  the restaurant looks too out-dated to even consider.  and the closest attraction to the place is the Outback and Home Depot, both across the parking lot/street.

yeah, pretty whatev, if you ask me.

So I write this review only because I have seen so many hotels freak out when something goes awry - and this place didn't.

philly got a nutty storm Tuesday night, knocking down trees, power lines, and ultimately killing the power to this hotel (but stangely, thankfully not to the Outback).  And by losing power, I mean - gone, nothing but flood lights, and from 9pm until roughly 10 the next morning.

But when other hotels would have freaked - these guys were calm, collected, and took care of their guests.  They opened the bar for free.  They gave out tons of water.  And for your romantic evening alone in your dark room - a glow stick right out of a Rave.  Next morning, they brought in breakfast for everyone as well.

OK, it sucked not having an iron, or an alarm clock, or a TV - but I survived - and no one seemed to get upset.  And really, they could have just thrown up their arms and said 'sorry, not our fault' - but they didn't - and for that they get 3.5 stars.

And they get another half a star for the old guy sitting at the bar, in the dark who tried to pick up my friend by telling her that Tuesday nights tend to have swingers frequent the hotel bar with their 'bosoms all hanging out' then asking if she came there often.

{"text":"I stayed here this past January for a weekend, and there was a power outage at 4am on Saturday morning. It woke me up because it was 20 degrees in my room. I walked down the stairs at 4am, and went to the front desk. I asked what the plan was; I could not sleep in a room that is 20 degrees. They said they had no plan. Whaaat?!? They didn't offer me an extra blanket- nothing. They advised me to go back upstairs and 'try to get some sleep'; my body will not sleep when it's arctic temperatures. I will never stay here again."}
{"text":"Took Mom here for Mother's Day. Big mistake. The food, although plentiful was dreadful. The bacon was super salty, the scrambled eggs watery, I asked for a steak knife to use on the eggs Benedict, the Hollandaise sauce tasted off, the beef was over cooked and tough. On the plus side, the Mimosa was perfect and the service was swift. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a couple days when in town for work. It was a fine stay, nothing extraordinary but definitely sufficient. Check-in was a breeze due to mobile check-in, service was fine, unfortunately I needed some hair products (usual stuff they carry) but they were out of it all :(
The rooms are on the smaller side compared to where I normally stay and the bathrooms really small - it was hard to move in there without constantly bumping the toilet or door. Also room service menu options were limited and their restaurant/bar was more like a bar in an open area, and the menu was not much better. 
For $200/night during the week, I would expect more but like I said, it was sufficient."}
{"text":"This place has been amazing.  After a terrible attempt to save some money on a cheap Motel - remember you get what you pay for, but refunds are sometimes required, the hotel staff got us into a room quickly and efficiently.  They were l amazing from the first phone call to walking through the door to trying to upgrade us to a suite because my roommate needed a safe in the room.  Although pricier than I would have liked to pay - it came with deals and amenities that I would expect and then some.  Well worth the extra money for the comfort and safety.  The staff is on top of their game and always smiling.  The pool/ jacuzzi area are wonderful - AND CLEAN!  The gym was also very nice - although you probably won't find me hanging out in there.  Beds-super comfy.  Rooms very clean.        I would most definitely recommend staying here."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am pleased that I did not read the reviews here prior to booking the hotel. We love this Sheraton. Every staff member has been highly efficient and exceedingly friendly. The club level is one of the best that I have ever stayed in. They welcomed my little, blind dog with open arms. We loved it so much, we booked it for another night!"}
{"text":"The hotel and staff are great with the exception of Michelle in the bar area. She might have been the most unfriendly person that I have ever met. Maybe she was just having a bad day. As far as the rest of the hotel I would have given them a 5."}
{"text":"Great remodeled hotel.  And the white horse restaurant is a must for dinner.  The menu is so much better than standard hotel selections. And weekend piano entertainment in the bar."}
{"text":"This was the worst run hotel I have ever been to. Sure it looks nice and the rooms are clean but the sheer incompetence of the staff was outrageous. They completely screwed up the reservations for the bride and bridal party the night before the wedding because the Kardashians came into town to sell some crap on QVC and needed the WHOLE floor for 2 people where the wedding block was supposed to be. They messed with a WEDDING for the Kardashians. Then once they \"found\" accommodations for a bride who had a signed CONTRACT with them, they proceeded to charge my brother and his soon to be wife 3 times for the suite that was supposed to be COMPED for the inconvenience completely draining their bank account directly before leaving for their honeymoon! The account couldn't be refunded immediately so they left for their honeymoon with only the cash from the cards they received. It would be nice if that was where it ended. The service in the hotel restaurant was pathetic. The father of the bride and family attempted to have lunch before the rehearsal and waited over an hour for food the server forgot to put in. The groom at a separate time had to remind a server 2 times to receive a beverage and waited over a half hour for food. ALL The tables in the restaurant were left dirty and un-bussed the entire length of brunch and The hotel bar was completely overwhelmed and understaffed on a weekend they had at least FOUR weddings booked. It was a complete and utter disaster and satisfactory compensation has yet to be made. It wasn't until the bride had to threaten the hotel management with the fact that she consulted with the lawyers she works for that they even started to make any attempt to rectify the situation in anyway."}
{"text":"This place seems to be one of the few choices in the area. It is the location that QVC and Zoetis house their employees coming from out of town. They advertise this weekly comp cocktail hour like if happens everyday, but don't be fooled it's only on Tuesdays. Starwood properties have Starbucks coffee in room which is a plus. Their restaurant is NOT good. Go across the driveway to potentially the worst outback in America, it's better than the restaurant here. The rooms need a remodel as there are some minor touches that are dated. Walls are thin so I always come here equipped with ear plugs and sleeping mask. To be honest, have not stayed up the street at holiday or hampton inn...but if you have a choice they might be worth a shot because nothing special is going on here. Three stars for the on sight bar which I would guess holiday inn and hampton don't have."}
{"text":"I have been to some damn nice hotels so it gets hard to compare after a while.  Everyone starts with a 3 and if you kick ass to another level in all regards (W Barcelona, St Regis Mumbai) then and only then do you get a 5.  But Sheraton Great Valley gets a super high fist bump for their excellent service.  Rocco is chill AF to go sit and talk to at the bar (basically any night of the week). Tom will give you a warm welcome and be super polite while doing it.  After a few months at this hotel I really enjoyed shooting the shit with him.  Carrie is the absolute best.  She is the manager and once went as far as helping me do my laundry when the machine was broken.  This is definitely going above and beyond. 

Food at the bar is ... okay at best.  Wings are solid. 

Suite upgrades come with a hot tub.  Unfortunately I was usually working too much to take full advantage of it. The beds are pretty comfy (pillows could be better).  The loyunge has a pretty decent breakfast and free drinks during the evening hors d'ouvres hour, yayyyy!!!! As a heads up, I have had wifi issues here.  That is something that could definitely be improved. 

I know some people in the area stay at the Marriott in Malvern.  After one week there, the Sheraton was clearly the better option."}
{"text":"I was a bit apprehensive after reading some of the reviews.  Arrived and was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful staff. When we got to our room there was a problem with the air conditioning. Within five minutes Scott from maintenance was in our room and notified the front desk that the unit was broken.  He spoke with Samantha who was kind enough to change our room and upgrade us to a suite! We dined in the Whitehorse Tavern where we encountered another outstanding employee.  Alicia was not only friendly she was knowledgeable when it came to the menu and made excellent recommendations. It's obvious that management took prior comments seriously and have turned things around. I would definitely stay here again when in the area."}
{"text":"The Sheraton, home away from home.I have been staying here for 20 years. Everyone is fantastic here and go the extra yard for their guest.   The bar is fantastic and they accomadate your drink or food need!  I would highly recommend the Sheraton."}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service alone! 

The staff was so great and helpful with everything and even as we were walking through the lobby, just asking us if we needed anything, making sure everything was ok with the stay etc. Very attentive!

The room was very well decorated and the bed very comfy, I did not want to leave! Also, the noon check out was nice...we weren't in a rush to get up and out, so it was nice taking our time and my husband was able to fit in a swim before we checked out."}
