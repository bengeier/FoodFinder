{"text":"Line up: none. Ample parking. Car preferable, TTC stop nearby. Choose your meal, dessert and beverage at the counter and food is brought to your table. Located in North York's more commercial area, south east of Sheppard Ave and Hwy 404. 5 stars.

Food: I ordered lamb pita and soup. A cappuccino and a scoop of hazelnut gelato. Pita was excellent with the two dips that accompany it, but the soup was not impressive. My gelato didn't taste like hazelnut, however my cappuccino was excellent. 4 stars.

Ambiance: trendy, modern, airy and spacious. Attention to cleanliness is evident throughout the restaurant including their restrooms. Cafeteria style but don't be fooled, this place is classy and customer service is top notch. The servers were ever so polite, helpful and attentive. 5 stars

Value: good value for money ~ $20-25 for dinner for one. If I wanted to order a wine or beer this place does have a liqueur license. 4 stars. 

Overall: 90%"}
{"text":"The area was in need of a restaurant like this.  A place to gather for lunches and after work meet ups.  Atmosphere is nice, modern and clean.  My friends and I got to try the mango gelato, shrimp sandwich, lamb sandwich and their super yummy dark chocolate dessert.  One of the best gelatos I have ever had.

It's nice to find a modern design restaurant in North York where you can go and chill with friends after work and avoid the traffic going up north or south.  There's plenty of parking in front so it's very convenient."}
{"text":"Interesting place with relax simple lunch cafe and nice dining area. Food are fresh and good portion. Friendly service!! Recommend"}
{"text":"The taste of food is average, but the venue is very presentable for the price. Servers are helpful and professional."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They made us wait and served other people first. 
Prices are expensive for the location. 
Great venue."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with coworkers and so thoroughly enjoyed their pastries, sandwiches and gelato that I have returned with my family, and have even brought my daughter's friends here for post playdate snacks.   The atmosphere is very pleasant, the decor is modern and the bathrooms are beautiful!!!  They haven't quite gotten the hang of things yet in terms of delivering the food to your table with the appropriate utensils - i.e. Whenever there's soup on your order, they never seem to include a spoon, but that's just me being fussy! All in all a good experience, and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I love Beiruti Grand Café.  The neighbourhood was in dire need of a good gathering place.  You can meet your friends for coffee and deserts or have a bite to eat.  Everything is delicious and beautifully presented.  I haven't had a bad meal or desert yet.  It's become my \"go to\" stop for lunch for a delicious and healthy meal - and I never leave there feeling guilty about what I ate - it's all good for you and prepared with quality ingredients.  I used to grab my lunch at Pusateri's in Bayview Village and now I drive the extra 5 mins and get a much better quality lunch!  

It's open for dinner too so I find myself picking up dinner a couple of times a week when I am looking for something light and healthy and I will often meet up with friends for coffee and deserts on weekends or evenings. 

My favourites; the double smoked trout salad, the lamb sandwich, the steak sandwich, the Beiruti chicken....pretty much everything I have tried has been delicious - you can't go wrong!  And the coffee is amazing!  Favourite breakfast item:  egg white omelet and multigrain croissant, although the manaeesh (thyme flat bread) is really good too. 

For anyone who eats lunch out, the prices are in line with (if not better than) what you would find at other cafe's or stores (like Pusaterie's or McEwan's) and I find the salads and sandwiches much, much better at Beiruti.  

Can't wait for more menu items to be added.

If you encounter any growing pains, just ask to speak to the owner - they are very supportive and welcome feedback."}
{"text":"Had the traditional sausage omelette, has olives and onion. Very tasty, it also came with a salad. Looking forward to going again to try other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. The space is very open and modern. The food is great, and always presented very nicely!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sultan Ibrahim and it was good. Also tasted the fish and chips someone else ordered. Both were very good. Also enjoyed the salted caramel gelato. Very nice restaurant. I would recommend you to visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered the nicoise tuna salad. The dressing tasted terrible. The tuna looked discolored and offputting. I think it had gone bad. I ate 40% of the salad staying clear of the tainted tuna and just couldn't stomach eating anymore. When I pointed out the tuna to the waiter he agreed that it looked bad. He went off to talk to the manager. He disappeared never to be seen again. I would think they would be more concerned about serving bad raw fish. I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"The first time here, it has become one of my favourite  the staff are friendly the food is amazing."}
{"text":"My daughter brought me here and I was puzzled how many times I passed and didn't notice it. The food is great. Very delicious kefta and tawook. Salad is awesome. I truly recommend this place for Mediterranean food lovers."}
{"text":"Amazing food , great ambience with live music especially on Saturday night. We were the for a friend's 30th birthday party and the venue, service and especially the food were all top notch - this place is just great can't say enough good things about it - just go there and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Was invited by my brother who found Beiruti just driving by. Happy he found it! Good food and good people helping you equals a good experience. Check it out! I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"So i have been here about 5 times since they opened. unfortunately this is the only restaurant in the area. The service and food keeps getting worse each time.   Firstly they are sooo unorganized, they never EVER get orders correct. Please check google for more accurate reviews.    They barely have a menu, so good luck if you are not familiar with the food. Im not sure if the \"servers\" are just so lazy, or miserable to be there, there so rude and always have an attitude. They never bring you napkins or cutlery, so then you go back and wait in line for that.   we waited 45 min. got one dish which we didn't even order, and the server tells us \" oh i punched in wrong orders\" so then we waited another half hour for the rest of our food.    Also they are verrry skimpy on sides and pita fillings now such as fries and hummus.       The picture i posted was when they first opened, the board no longer looks like that."}
{"text":"I called in to place my order on the phone about half hour before pick up (food for about 6 people at the office). The lady on the phone was very pleasant. I arrived a few minutes before I said I would. The whole process from start to finish was completely seamless. I had made a small change on my salad from goat cheese to feta cheese and feared that when I got back it might have not been done. It was!

When I got back to the office - i was so happy to see little labels on everything and they didnt miss a single thing. From start to finish I had a really good experience.  I work on yorkland blvd and we cater alot in our office. I loved how easy they made everything and everyone was so happy with how the food tasted.

I would go again and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night based on a friend's recommendation. The cafe is nestled in a office area so it could be a little hard to find. Upon entering the place, I was immediately impressed by the upscale decor. The main portion of the cafe is an open cafeteria style setup where you first pay for your order and return to your table with a numbered sign. The other side is a dining room with an even fancier setup (probably for events).

Food 3.5/5
My party of four ordered the Ahi Tuna Nicoise salad, chicken shawarma plate, chicken shawarma wrap, sea bream and a iced vanilla latte. Starting from the best, the sea bream was well worth the half an hour wait. Although it may seem pricey at first for $22, you actually get a whole fish with a side with fries or rice. The fish was perfectly cooked, flaked off easily with a fork and retained the naturally juices. It was perfectly seasoned and didn't need any lemon or seasoning. The rice was a standout as well, nice and buttery but not greasy in any way. The chicken shawarma plate and wrap are essentially the same thing but I really liked that the wrap had been heated with a sandwich press. It kept the wrap from being soggy and the grill marks left a nice crunch when you bit into it. The salad was alright in terms of taste but the presentation was very appetizing due to the various colours on the plate. Dressing however seemed bland and didn't compliment the salad whatsoever. To finish the meal we ordered ice cream but my favourite flavour was ashta. The server explained that it was all made in house and was a Lebanese specialty. It had a thicker, stickier consistency than regular ice cream which was great because it didn't melt as quickly. It wasn't overly sweet and tasted like marshmallows with almond shavings.

Service 3.5/5
As previously mentioned the cafe doesn't have a regular dining room setup, so interactions with staff is fairly limited. The cashier however was still friendly and very patient even though we took longer to order.

Overall it was a good experience. The sea bream is a must-try and it was a nice change from what I normally eat."}
{"text":"I think I am in love! 

Such a well thought out place and pretty luxurious feeling. Lets start with food. I had the fleur de cao and tiramisu they were both rich and creamy. Made in house and fresh (yes, I had both by myself). Paired with the cappuccino it was superb. Came to about $16. Everything was aesthetically appealing. I would like to try the savory food and gelato next. 

Lets talk about the feel of the place. The place is clean, the waiters and waitresses are so friendly. The owner makes an effort to come around ask how everything is and talks about the food. You can tell he's proud of this establishment. When I walked in, I was a lone wolf the thing that I dislike the most when going to a cafe alone is needing to go to the washroom because who is going to watch my stuff? The owner kindly offered to watch it made me feel like the service here is on a different level. 

The decor is gorgeous. They have cafeteria style long tables and small ones that seat four. They have these bar style tables that are high, equipped with a hanger for your bag and outlets for electronics, free public wifi. 

The washrooms definitely warrant a mention, they are very clean and the taps are the dyson ones with hand dryers on the side. The details make this place a new favourite of mine and for the service, quality of food and ambiance you're getting it is worth it."}
{"text":"Decor - This cafe is great. It's very big and tastefully decorated, so it has a very upmarket feel to it. The furniture is modern.

Location - It is located on the consumer's road, near Sheppard/Consumer's Road intersection. There is a very big parking lot out front.

Tea - We tried their celebration tea and Persian tea, both were great.

Sandwich and Soup - We tried grilled vegetable sandwich which was pretty nice too and it came with butternut squash soup which had a good consistency, healthy and tasty at the same time. It was served hot.

Pastry - We tried Ashta and it was mind-blowing. Soft, delicate and tasted like pistacchio, berries and kiwi. Very well done.

Flatbread - We tried Labneh which was awesome too.

We couldn't find fault with anything. It was almost too perfect. This is going to be our new favourite spot (as it's 2-3 km from where we live)."}
{"text":"Pro:
-Ambiance is amazing!  Brand new, place is very trendy but yet cozy.  Cool light fixtures, raw wood tables, mis matched chairs, very inviting.
-I had the Croque Monsieur which was yummy and it comes with a side salad.  The sandwiches seem to be pre-assembled then pressed/heated
-Gelato is quite delicious.  I was lucky to have the opportunity to try about 6 flavors and they were all tempting...even the sorbet!  Try the mango sorbet.  But I had the 70% chocolate and I dont even like dark chocolate, but it was a good choice.  Also, it is made on premises +++
-the staff!  Very warm and friendly.  Huge shout out to Mia!  She helped me book our reservation and was helpful right until we left.

Con:
-nothing to complain about...I think perhaps the selection of food could be greater, however, since it is a new establishment, I foresee them expanding their menu.

Will definately be back"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place with the intention of grabbing some coffee. But was surprised to see that this isn't just a cafe; it's a restaurant and pastry shop all in one! After all, they do call themselves French Mediterranean fusion, can't expect anything less! 

Decided to try the shrimp and lobster pita, and boy was it good! The salads also looked amazing, and were pleasantly unusual for a cafe. They have seat trout salad, tuna Niçoise salad, among others. All of them looked amazing and I can't wait to try them.

A gem in the area! 5 stars. Great food, good service, and oh..... Did I mention the washrooms are super clean and classy?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has two sections, one take-out/fast food oriented section and the other dine-in. We arrived for lunch and decided to try the dine-in section. 

The atmosphere is great, although it is a little on the dim side but nonetheless, beautiful and very spacious. The staff is super attentive, friendly and helpful with placing orders. Our server (sorry, I forgot his name) was a very nice gentleman that took his time to explain things from their menu and gave us wonderful suggestions as well.

We ordered the cold mezza sampler (individual servings of hummus, baba ghanouj and fatoush), the soujouk rolls (Armenian spiced beef sausage rolled in pita) and the meshawi (two skewers of your choice of tawouk or kefta. Served with grilled onions & tomato, toum and fries). Everything was delicious especially the tawouk skewer, we were expecting it to be tough and dry but quite the opposite! The fatoush wasn't a huge hit at our table though but overall, the food was delicious.

I would definitely come back to try their sandwiches from the other section and would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I loved this cafe! It is specious and clean. I ordered a plate of salad which was delicious and filling. My husband had a sandwich with a very tasty, thin flat bread. The staff is very friendly. I will definitely go back for lunch again to try their other specialty foods and also to try their desserts and ice cream."}
{"text":"Location/Service
It's on Consumers Road, a little south of Sheppard within a small plaza.
The restuarant blends so well with the other business buildings in the area - so you might miss it. But there's a lot of parking available within the plaza and across the street.
Inside is very modern, with higher quality of tables/chairs, giving off a relaxing cafe vibe. There's also a lot of seating arrangements, but small/big groups or people who wants to study/do work.

Food
I came here for a quick lunch with colleagues. Ordered the Salmon Arugula Flatbread (priced around $15). The bread itself was very thin and crispy. The salmon was a little dry, but adding in the cheese and arugula covers it up pretty nicely.

It's a nice place to have lunch - I see small families coming in as well. I'd be interested to try their other dishes and coffee."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, and a great place to meet up with friends but also get some work done. Plenty of room and service was fantastic. Food was also delicious.

I had the chicken shawarma wrap and everything on the plate was delicious. I also tried the salted caramel latte which was great (especially for someone who doesn't like salted caramel much)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was truly a five star experience. The decor has a contemporary modern feel. The waitress was nice and helpful, the food was delicious and the chef even greeted us after our meal. There's a bakery right next to it which had delicious desserts. The pistachio mousse cake was the single greatest slice of cake I have ever had."}
{"text":"It is definitely a great place for brunch and afternoon tea. The interior decoration is simple and clean, but the sandwiches and desserts are both good in tasting and looking. I have been to Beiruti for several times, usually on weekends. Every time I went there I got nice service. Its dessert menu sometimes will be refreshed seasonally, which is great for someone who cares about freshness. But there is not much seats or dining space inside. Although we could sit on the patio, I would not say it has a romantic dining environment with good view. Overall, I like this place, and will be back often."}
{"text":"Everything is done pretty well here. The food is delicious, the staff is actually very friendly, helpful and give suggestions. 

It's basically a high end cafeteria, with high priced wraps. However, for the price, the food is actually very tasty and filling. My wrap meal came to $14 with $4 dessert! 

I had the crab and shrimp wrap with tomato and cream soup which was lovely. Water, you serve yourself. For dessert, a strawberry tart and it tasted a little jelly-like. Overall the dessert was okay. 

If you buy your meal with a dessert, the dessert becomes $4 instead of $6!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were delighted to try Beiruti since there aren't a lot of good restaurants around our workplace. I've been to Beiruti a few times and overall, I really like it. You have to line up to order, pay and you're given a number to place on your table and the food is brought to your table. There's a fair selection of wraps, sandwiches and salads. I've had the mushroom sandwich and it was delicious, the steak sandwich was ok and the trout salad was pretty good. The sandwiches come with your choice of a small side salad or soup. The desserts are DELICIOUS and if you get it for take out it comes in a pretty cute container.  However, I would like to see more mediterranean desserts and food other than manaeesh (the manaeesh is pretty good though!) The venue is nice, clean and spacious, and has a lot of free parking.  The staff are friendly and welcoming. However, I do find it overpriced."}
{"text":"Cute place for dessert, customer service was good. I got a crepe and a cake, both were excellent. Server was so nice to explain how everything works and what he would recommend. The price was a bit high but that's okay cause everything was nice. The inside was super modern and chic. The only thing was I was wondering if this place was Halal cause it's Lebanese and the server was saying all the meat except pork is Halal which was weird so I just didn't eat any meat. Dessert was great though!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. It's spacious, the service is great and the foood taste great! I love their food selection and their dessert, especially the gelato is wonderful! I come here often and I always recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"Good food but prices have gotten out of hand, especially for the area (random small office complex in north York). 

$14 for sandwiches is not practical for lunch. When they opened, pricing was around $8-10 per item, a reasonable premium for the quality."}
{"text":"This place is clean and looks upscale. There is a wide variety of middle-eastern foods. The main entrees are set out beautifully on artsy/hipster manners. 

However, I echo Jennifer K's review about the furniture. The chairs and tables are uncomfortable. The chairs are either too high/low for the table. All of my friends complained about this and it negatively impacted our dining experience.

One other thing, the service is really spotty. The food is served slowly and the servers (I can tell they make an effort) seem really disorganized. 

This place has potential, but just needs to improve first."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal in the restaurant. The presentation of the food and the taste was excellent and very impressive. The service was medium, but overall a wonderful experience. Everything we tried was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Environment is quite fancy. BUT BAD SERVICE! BAD FOOD!!! Came here for brunch on Saturday. I ordered a beef burger and my boyfriend had a beef plate. We needed to wait more than half and hour when there were not many people. When I finally had my food, but only found the beef was over cooked - it was so dry and the bottom was black! Totally disappointed. Won't come next time."}
{"text":"Beiruti 
The food is decent, BUT the management of the place and the service is beyond miserable!
We gave this place three tries to be fare. 
Never again, unless we are willing to put up with unready table, slower than turtles staff, food that takes for ever to come and a set menu that is missing few items because they ran out of food!
It's really really frustrating.

Yes the food is pretty good, but the frustration of dealing with the service is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Found out this place is close by so I dropped by with a friend to try it out. The location of the restaurant is integrated into all the commercial buildings, so it will be harder to find at first. Drive down Consumers Road and once you passed Yorkland Blvd, turn right into the entrance on the right. 

At first when I walked into the restaurant. It was like a lunch place with a counter with lots of dessert, pastries and sandwiches. Then I saw the maitre d' table and waited there, and not long after I was lead to a table. The decor of the restaurant carries a modern feel. 

So I was looking through the menu and then I referenced back to the pictures on Yelp just to see what I am in for. (I don't often eat Mediterranean cuisine). Made the decision to order hummus and pita, calamari, lamb shanks and beef burger (yes I played it safe here). Food did take a bit longer to come out. As I feel the restaurant (not the cafe side) is still getting their processes in place. So the order duration may take a bit longer. After some time, our food came out. The pita and hummus tasted amazing, I asked for refills on the pita as I was gulping down that hummus with the pita. The rice pilaf with the lamb shank was wow! The rice had grains, pomegranate, and peas. This addition added extra flavour to rice. And the lamb shank was tender and tasty. The calamari is tasted just alright, can't really go wrong with calamari. This also applies to the beef burger, can't go wrong with it. 

I feel the process/wait time will improve, and that's my only comment. Food was great and ambience was just right (not too loud and not too bright). Will I come back? Yes I will."}
{"text":"The open space concept of this place helped us to spend a lot of time with my friends to talk and enjoy our meal, which I really like about it... I tried the crab sandwich...it tastes good not great...its bread tastes so good but the sauce beside it was a little greasy and the lettuce inside the sandwich was not fresh...the pastries was great, it tastes nice and smooth...but I have a big problem with this place and it's about the pictures they advertised in their yelp! I couldn't find them in their menu which is awkward! Other than that it's not a bad place to spend your Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I've had almost everything on their menu, all delicious without exception. My standout favorite is their mushroom sandwich.
For desert, I have two words, Ashta Gilato.
The atmosphere is awesome! Great place for a date, or dinner with friends.
A rare gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"LOVE this cafe! I've been here numerous times in the summer for lunch. I am normally very picky when it comes to Middle Eastern food, however I really enjoyed this place.
Very aesthetic cafe with prompt service.
Also, prices are pretty fair for what you order.
I've tried the fattoush salad, roasted chicken pita with brie, and the shawarma wrap with fries. Highly recommend any of theses they taste fabulous!
Also, they have delicious desserts such as gelato, macarons, cakes, pastries, crepes, etc."}
{"text":"Came to Beiruti Grand Cafe for lunch after seeing the raving reviews and was completely underwhelmed with the food and minuscule portions and almost had a heart attack when finding out the price of this subpar fast food. 

We came in around 12:30 and were considering going to the restaurant side, but couldn't find a single employee to seat us. So we had no choice but to go to the cafe side where you order your food at the counter, pay first, and go sit at cafeteria-style tables with cheap plastic chairs. For two of us, we got two sandwiches, a hummus, a baba ghanouj, one tea, and one cake and it came out to $57! And we were still hungry after as the portions are very small. 

The hummus and baba ghanouj was good, but pricey at $5 each for the amount they give you. Also, the pita bread that came with it was thin and limp. Nothing like the freshly baked moist and plump pitas that you get at Paramount.

All the sandwiches are premade, so they just warm it up, which further hardens the already dried out meat. We got the lamb pita and duck tuscanu sandwich, both ridiculously expensive at $14 each. And to add insult to injury, they charge an extra $2 to upgrade from the basic garden salad to the premium salad! I was interested in trying the heart of palm salad, so I got the upgrade. The salad was ok but nothing special, and the tiny bowl they give you is a joke. The taste of the sandwiches are decent, but for the price they are charging, the very least they can do is make the sandwich fresh on order. 

All the desserts lined up in the counter looks delicious, but the hazelnut cake we got for $6 was one of the worst I've ever had. I might as well have been eating a stick of butter, as that's all you taste. There is no taste of hazelnut and its just one texture, that of eating cold butter. Compared to similarly priced desserts from Ruelo or Duo patisserie, there you get a much more rich flavor profile, different layers with varying textures and crunch. The one from here was so bad, we almost didn't finish it. 

Overall, this place is horribly expensive for the low-quality food they serve. Paramount is probably the closest comparison to this place where you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Paramount is not only cheaper, but the food portion and taste is far superior. For desserts, I'm basing my conclusion on just the one horrible cake we had. Perhaps the other desserts are better, but I wouldn't dare come back to try another. I'm seriously puzzled as to how this place has so many 5-star reviews. All the staff were friendly and helpful, but not enough by any means to offset the ridiculously high price and low-quality food. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Must try gelato: pistachio green tea & chocolate.
Nice bakeries and gourmet sandwiches."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick lunch in the spacious and modern restaurant. Sandwiches were fresh and tasty. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is tasty but pretty over-priced if you ask me. The service is good but I'm not the biggest fan of the open-concept design, it lacks character if you ask me. I actually go here a lot but 90% of the time I get a coffee to go!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened up by my work! I've been here three times now and so far my experiences have been stellar. The cafe is quite big so there's never an issue finding seating. I always come with a large group (8-12 people) of coworkers (we are all fans) right at noon and we never have to wait for seating. The style of ordering is like a cafeteria where you order at the counter first and then take your seat. They give you a table number and a server brings you the food when it's prepared. 

The food comes out quickly since it's already prepared. They just have to heat it up if you get a sandwich or soup. Salads are usually pre-made. So far I have tried the crab sandwich (twice!!) and the ahi tuna salad. The crab sandwich is on a toasted pretzel bun. The bread is chewy and the crab to bread ratio is perfect. The ahi tuna salad comes with half a hard boiled egg and a few pieces of tuna with a lemon pepper dressing. My only complaint about the salad is that I wish the tuna slices were a bit thicker. My coworkers have gotten nearly everything from the menu and we've yet to have someone dislike their food! 

They give you the option of either getting the soup of the day or a garden salad with your entree, I always go with the soup. I've had a red lentil soup and a cream of mushroom soup. Both soups had a bit of a kick to it that was a really unexpected (but delicious) touch!

If you want some dessert after your meal they've got an assortment of gelato, crepes, and pastries to choose from.

Parking is easily found on the lot right outside. Their washrooms are also really nice! Very sleek design with the fancy new dyson faucets that have the blowers attached. I was very amused when I saw them for the first time haha"}
{"text":"Food was really good but they lacked in service. We got there on a rainy Sunday morning for brunch.  We walked up to the cash register line to order for food and since it was our first time we just looked around and ordered whatever interested us. Apparently some things were unavailable because it was on their lunch menu which wasn't available yet at the time we got there. ..but no where on the menus said that. Speaking of menus, they only had drinks menu clearly visible, food menus were on a few tables,but that's pointless when we're suppose to order up front first at the cash so we many of us in line didn't realize til after we ordered from what we saw on display through some struggles.. anyways after we told a lady what we wanted as we approached the cash register two customers in front of us were complaining as well about the service that it was slow and unorganized. When it was our turn the cash lady couldn't find our order that was done ..poor communication between the staff themselves. 

I'd still give this place 3 stars despite the unpleasant service because their food was good, you can tell their ingredients were fresh and presentation was nice."}
{"text":"We stopped by on the way home to try this place out and decided to go to the dining hall ... spent over 80$ for a few cold and hot mezzas. As a previous reviewer said if you are Lebanese don't come here at all, and if you do come in don't go to the dining hall ?"}
{"text":"Awesome café, amazing desserts, very high quality. My friend ordered the Fleur de Cao, and I had the Irish cream gelato with a cappuccino. Everything was beyond expectation. Very modern and sleek interior, and large patio for warmer seasons.Highly recommended and worth the drive out of the city."}
{"text":"Time for a review update. This is review for the \"Cafe\" and not the Beiruti restaurant, they really should advertise it separately.

I have been to the cafe multiple times now and I have tried plenty of their offerings. It seems like they have addressed most of the concerns.

1) Their desserts are now labeled for the most part (except for ice cream flavours)
2) Service is much better and faster now.

Their Chicken Shawarma is mind blowing!! one of the few places who carry traditional shawarmas (fries in the shawarma and little to no veggies). The meat inside is grilled to perfection!

So this is lowkey a shawarma joint, however the shawarmas are a little expensive for the price ($9). My SO has also bought sandwiches from here for her meeting and everybody liked it.

The only downside, the price is just a tad higher than I'd like it to be(Maybe justified with the increase in minimum wage). Other than that, best place to grab lunch in the area imo."}
{"text":"I visited from 3-7pm on a Saturday with a friend to catch up over food and there was a steady flow of ~10 customers in the cafe during those hours. My friend and I had the chai latte, eech, ham and cheese pretzel sandwich, braised lamb shank, apricot cake, and chocolate cake. They were all great, and my personal favourite was the braised lamb! It took about 5-10 minutes after ordering for the food to be served and we ordered dessert after, which came immediately. 

I loved that all their items are on display so you see exactly what's in it and the bar tables had hooks underneath to hang jackets/bags, which I always find useful. The interior has a black and white theme and wooden accents - very clean. Not to mention, their washroom has a 'wow' effect  (can't speak on the male washroom though). I would definitely bring my parents to try the restaurant side of Beiruti. 

Tip: There's a Groupon available for both the cafe and restaurant!"}
{"text":"It feels like a very upscale cafeteria, different concept indeed! The decor is gorgeously modern with lots of white, which contrasts with the dark elements of the decor and is complimented by the shiny silver pendant lights. Lots of spacious seating: open, airy and bright with plenty of beautiful backdrops for selfies.

One thing that I love about the food displays is that they're very enticing; I like food that's visually appealing as well as tasty. Most of the food is labeled and includes the ingredient list. You start at the far right of the counter and choose your main (flat breads with various toppings on top shelf, sandwiches in the middle and salads on the bottom); the flat breads and sandwiches come with a small side salad or soup of the day. You move to your left and peruse the artful dessert section. When you reach the cashier, tell them which desserts, drinks and/or gelato you want to add then pay and take your number to a table of your choice (self serve water at the end of the long counter past the first gelato case). Take your number to your table and they will deliver the food to you. High top tables here are made for tall people; when my friend and I (5'2\") sat at one, the table was at our chest level.

My girlfriend and I ordered:

- Grilled Veggie sandwich (roasted eggplant, arugula, zucchini, confit tomato, red pepper and basil pesto) with the side salad. I'm a hardcore carnivore but I did enjoy the flavors of this sandwich and the delicious crusty bread that they used.
-Coppa flat bread(coppa meat, artichoke, mushrooms, fig & feta cheese) with the sweet potato soup side. The flat bread was tasty and the toppings were savory and delicious. The soup was nice and thick with a natural sweetness to it.
- Latte with hazelnut syrup served with a cute, little flower cookie. Pretty decent, no need to add sugar.
- Cake that had pistachios, ashta (clotted cream with rose water and orange blossom water) covered in a raspberry glaze with white chocolate around the base. This dessert looked beautiful, was aromatic and had a nice balance between the sweet and tart flavors.

Service is quick and friendly but if you are a noob and start asking a lot of questions, like me, they're not as warm. Service stops when they drop off your food but when you're done, just leave your dishes on the table and they'll take care of it. 

Thanks to Dennie I for the awesome tip about coming during peak hours to ensure you get food that's freshly made and not sitting around all day. I would also recommend coming when they first open as well.

My friend and I had an amazing girly lunch here. I will surely bring my other girlfriends to come and enjoy their flavorful,  beautifully crafted Lebanese/French/Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place, while the quality of the food is not bad, the food portions are pathetically small, paying 11 dollars for a chicken tawouk wrap, you would expect something slightly more than a tiny thin little sandwich, it looked embarassingly small and bare on the huge plate they served it on. Also, the place was fairly empty and the service was not very fast, the lighting is also quite dark in places, not really the type of quality you expect when you first walk in. Make your portions atleast double the size for the same price and you might get 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"We work around the corner and discovered this gem when if first opened. Delicious gormet sandwiches, great portion, comes with a side. The chicken sandwiches are not your average, definitely must try. The ingredients and flavours are the reason why we keep coming back, you can tell they're made fresh and with care. On the occasion, we opt for the mananeesh and little pies, made fresh in a separate oven. The sweets are such treats, their hazelnut cake is one of my favourites! Average spend is usually $10-15 depending if you order coffee and dessert, definitely worth it. I always enjoy my lunch, never disappointed  service is a bit slow but they do heat up your food, all sandwiches are made first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"It's in a bit of an odd location given it's more upscale style.  It's kinda like a fancy version of the Ikea cafeteria- meaning you see the food behind the glass and order at the cash.

The slight difference is that they give you a number to take to your seats and the server brings you your food.

The food seems to be towards the healthier side - wraps, sandwiches, salads, middle eastern style pizza.  There is also a bakery section with delicious looking cakes, tarts, macarons, and croissants.  A tea/coffee menu that serves Sloane tea is my kinda joint!

Sleek white table and chairs, funky lighting make this a great place for brunch!

Today I tried the salmon sandwich on this rustic yummy bread that had sesame seeds and I think pumpkin seeds on it.  Highly recommend it!  With my tea, croissant and broccoli salad it came out to about $17 with tax.  Not bad at all.

You can also buy the flat bread (baked in store!) They have zataar, half cheese/half zataar, half tomato/cheese and one with beef.  It's about $10 for the pack (you get quite a lot of bread)

I will definitely be back since this place isn't too far from - I think I found my neighborhood brunch spot!"}
{"text":"A large cafeteria/showroom type space with a little bit of everything - Mediterranean/Lebanese mains; French pastries & dessert; Italian Gelato; Coffee; Sandwiches & Salads.

I had the cappuccino and almond croissant. I liked the espresso flavor with perfect balance of slightly sweet milk, little foam. Almondtine had good almond filling, asked for warmed up but wasn't very warm.

The leek quiche + salad for $9 is a good deal compared to the sandwiches which are $12+. I liked the salad dressing and quiche was good too but could be warmer. 

The Beiruiti coffee is the size of an espresso shot, similar to Turkish coffee. 

Lemon gelato is super sour!

Service can be improved a bit if the servers smile more. A hidden gem - I would return for a coffee; good place for afternoon snack & chat with friend."}
{"text":"Food selection was good.  I was actually surprised they had items like fish & chips, lamb burger, crepes, shawarma, and alcoholic drinks.  I ordered the lamb burger with fries.  Yumz.  Everything was decently priced.  Decor was nice especially the bathrooms.  They have high tech dryer and hand washing technology.  Friendly staff.  I would return.  Definitely worth a try.  This is a order at the front then they bring u your food type restaurant, you don't order at your table.  Pretty good experience overall."}
{"text":"This place can be easy to miss if you're just driving by, so look carefully! Decor is minimal but nice. You order at the front, and they take it to your table.

Forgot how they actually called it, but what I ordered was a Chicken Shawarma Wrap Plate. It came with your choice of rice or fries (I chose fries obviously), coleslaw, some dippables and hummus. I also got an Iced Latte.

The Chicken Shawarma was pretty good. I liked the way they plated it. The whole wrap was grilled, so it was nice and warm. The flavours were good. And the sides were great with the hummus. Was quite a lot of food, but I did my best and ate it all. Iced Latte came out as a blended iced coffee actually and it was okay.

They also have a lot of dessert options so I definitely want to come back to try when I'm less stuffed."}
{"text":"I have never been this disappointed for breakfast. We walked in on a Saturday morning the place was empty but it looked clean so I had high expectations. The Cafe had delectable looking desserts, gelato. We ordered chicken Shawarma but apparently it's not available until an hour after so we settled for the Soujouk omelet and a Beiruti omelet, an Americano one Beiruti coffee and 2 mini Pies. After 10 minutes of waiting, server informed us that the sijouk is not available, and suggested ham instead. The Pies were good, thin crackers with seeds on top. Omelet arrived 40 minutes later, soaking in oil, with 1.5 pieces of tiny rye toast, no butter on the side and fruits that looked like it has been soaking in liquid syrup for days. First bite turned me off right away, the omelet lacked salt and flavour and every spoonful comes with tons of oil. For $12 it was a huge disappointment. The fruits were as I expected, soggy and overripe. The only saving grace was the good coffee. I highly doubt there'll be a next time for me."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! One might suspect it's an expensive restaurant, given that how the food is plated and the restaurant's decor, but it's not. This place is surprisingly reasonably priced! $14 for a duck confit sandwich and a side salad is a steal! Not to mention that the sandwich is loaded with high quality ingredients -- have you seen that big chunk of brie cheese?"}
{"text":"Listed as one of the top 5 new dessert places on BlogTO and living in close proximity to the Grand Café, I invited my beautiful man friend David and his GF to join us for Sunday lunch. I've driven past the café many times without knowing of its existence, its nestled just south of Victoria Park and Sheppard with a huge parking lot, more than half of which are reserved for Beiruti customers. The Café itself is enormous, half of which is unused space that would be great for dancing on. Glass display cases show off a variety of sandwiches, pitas, and entrees on one side and their homemade gelato on the other separated by their POS. There's also a 2nd separate counter for desserts and pastries in front of their kitchen. There is plenty of seating with a mix of bar counters, tables, long-ass communal tables and comfy couches with coffee tables. 

Similar to Panera, you order your food at the counter and then you're given a number to place at your table where the wait staff will deliver your food. The sandwiches and pitas, even before they're heated look amazing, you can tell they put a lot of effort in to presentation which in no way compromises the taste. I ordered the Croque Monsieur ($6) and my GF had the Beiruti Chicken Pita ($10) which comes with a side of salad or soup. Being the fatty that I am, I decided to try a couple meat pies ($1.25 each), about a third the size of a frozen mini pizza. We also ordered a hazelnut latte ($4.50) and a Persian Tea. The sandwich was incredible although very heavy, I only ate half of it and took the rest to go. The pita was also very good, you can tell the dough was baked fresh and the filling was flavourful. They offered 3 different meat pies but I only had the one with a dollop of cheese and one with straight meat which did not match the level of the sandwiches, the meat pie had a cinnamon flavor which threw me off while the cheese one was a little too herbaceous for my tastes. The latte was beautifully crafted but lacked the hazelnut flavor, also a little pricey for a small. Near the end of our meal as they were clearing our table, the café owner/manager came to our table to ask about our experience, a simple interaction that boosted our impression of the place.

As much as I wanted to try the pastries and macarons at the dessert counter, our eyes were on the gelato from when we first walked in. They had an offering of 16 flavours and like most gelato places, let you sample them. We decided on a scoop each of Irish cream, pistachio and raspberry sorbet ($6), topped with caramel or fruit drizzle and a pirouette on the side. Very well made and tasty but the scoops were on the small side compared to G for Gelato downtown.

PROS:
-Nice ambience, lots of natural light in the daytime, classy décor, huge space
-Great value on the sandwiches which come with soup or salad
-Most items including desserts are made in house
-Friendly and attentive staff and owner
-Plenty of parking and seating

CONS:
-Nothing negative to say, if I'm going to be really picky, the small meat pies were not spectacular and they use cinnamon in many of their dishes which I don't care for but that's a personal preference

I could see myself becoming a regular here for gelato and lunches, especially in the summer as it's within walking distance for me. I look forward to trying the other desserts and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Warning: Food at the restaurant is $$$$!! Not $$ Go dine at the cafe if needed.

Pictures looked amazing, so was pretty surprised to find only 3 tables including us on a Thursday evening. The staff there was nice, but wanted to mention that we were asked to get up from our seats and relocate the table towards the front of the restaurant. Why's there a restriction on where to sit even though there were very little people? There just wasn't any excuse. 

[Ok] COLD MEZZA SAMPLER $16 - It came with hummus (too sour), baba ghanouj and fatoush (just salad with dressing and crunchy stuff) as well as some cold flatbread (should have been warmed like Paramount does it). Only the baba ghanoui was really good, the rest was something I could have purchased cheaper from Paramount from across the street.

[Bleh!] FALAFEL $12 - For 6 pieces, it tasted pretty freaking awful. Fried rock solid, cold, and super salty. The tarator sauce helped soften it but, could only stomach 2.5 pieces before letting the rest go to spoil.

[Not bad] MESHAWI $22 - Two skewers of your choice of tawouk (chicken) or kefta (beef). Seasonal grilled vegetables, toum, fries; ordered 1 chicken and 1 beef. Chicken tasted a bit better, while the beef was pretty dry. However, the garlic paste on the side made the whole dish taste much better. 

Decor was very nice, but food was lacking. Hated paying lots of money for mediocre food. Next time, I may just go to the cafe section and pay less--food at the restaurant portion was waaaayyy too expensive. Might as well go to the Paramount which tasted pretty good for better prices. Anyway, I blame my curiosity and made a bad decision again."}
{"text":"This is such a lovely place for lunch. 
It's quiet, very spacious and the modern decoration is gorgeous. 

I ordered the chicken pita with 8 desserts because they all look so yummy, I couldn't choose! It is all now nicely labeled and you know what is what. 

The downside is that most of the food is already prepared, all they do is heat it up. So you never know how long it's been sitting there. 

But I will go back again!"}
{"text":"Nice environment!Nice food!I had the vanilla cake and grilled chicken flatbread!And they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch.
Ordered:
- 6 pastries @$6 each.
- Ashta crepe $9.
-Sharazad cocktail (gélato) $10.
- large coffee $2.50
- gourmet pita $10.

The ambiance made the food worth it.
All their sandwiches/pizza look \"gourmet\" and not ordinarily seen in coffee shop like Starbucks, Ikea cafétéria or Panera Bread.
Priced from $8 - $14.

The washrooms are very WHITE clean and similar to public washrooms that can be found in hotels (Le Château Frontenac without the key entry/ Skydome Hotel...etc).

It is a better place to have a cup of coffee and dessert .....over Starbucks ANYTIME!"}
{"text":"Overall I think the food, design, and service of the restaurant is pretty good. However I have one major issue that ensures I will not order from the glass display during non-peak hours.

Maybe I am the only one who noticed this, but they take the food directly from the glass display and heat it again. Not so bad if its freshly made during lunch hour, but imagine coming here during non-peak times. The salad/sandwich could have been sitting there for hours then served to you....unappetizing."}
{"text":"This Lebanese cafe is a hidden gem on Consumers Rd. It's slightly hidden among the business buildings that surround it. Parking is plentiful and I'd say this is a lovely spot for a date, lunch, or dessert. The interior is gorgeous and rather modern, and the selection of food, desserts and drinks are plentiful. I personally love the the Ashta crepe which I find divine paired with a cup of hazelnut latte or sahlab  The cafe however has been deemed by a several of my friends as too pricey and since a lot of their salads/ sandwiches and flatbread aren't made fresh to order but are instead displayed and simply heated up, I'd have to agree that I find the prices not that fitting for some of the mains."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is best described as welcoming and relaxing. From the spacious placement of the tables to their exceptional customer service to the spectacular assortment of displayed desserts, this is a restaurant definitely somewhere I'd be returning. 

I ordered the lamb burger plate. I thought it was a little bit pricey for the portion size, relative to other middle eastern restaurants, though I'd have to say that the burger was very juicy and flavourful - which makes up for it."}
{"text":"Beiruti serve pastries, sandwiches, burgers, pita, salad, hot dishes, and even dessert like macaroons, cakes, and gelato. It is surrounded by many larger business buildings like Rogers, Amex, SunLife Financial have their offices here within walking distance. Design of the cafe is simplistic modern style, the plastic furnitures, and spacious area is probably designed to accommodate the lifestyle of white collar business professionals that work around the area. 

Iced latte is ($3) with salted caramel (extra $1) is not so sweet, which is great to my preference. I do wish the hint of 'salt' is a bit stronger. It is cold but with minimal amount of ice, which is good because the glass is small. The sweetness of hot hazelnut latte is just right. I did ask for no sugar but it is still pretty sweet (probably due to the sweet steam milk/cream they added to the coffee). If you want sugar free, then you may want to ensure to ask them not to put sweet cream in it.

The Ocao Chocolate cake ($6) is very rich in chocolate. Fine cocoa powder on the outside, very rich, creamy, and smooth chocolate fudgy centre. Perfected with bits of hazelnuts and slightly crunchy base to make tasting not so boring. The size is perfect for sharing for two people. In my opinion, if you are getting the cake, the not so sweet latte is perfect companion."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service.
Had the lamb sandwich with the soup of the day, lentil and pasta soup. Deeeelicious flavours! The lamb was tasty with very fresh vegetables and a spicy sauce on the side for dipping-a nice touch. The soup was excellent, first time having soup with mint in it and it was a really good surprise. The service was excellent; very friendly and handed out samples of crepes and other items. Atmosphere is modern and clean. An upscale cafeteria format. Lots of food options and some really beautiful desserts! Tried the pistachio cherry cake, nice and light, and the chocolate almond raspberry tart, chocolatey and rich. Neither were too sweet. Looking forward to returning and trying the flat bread and gelato!"}
{"text":"Spacious area with great coffee! A great quiet place to spend the afternoon alone or with friends. Great decor and selection of desserts and food!"}
{"text":"The place is very spacious, the washrooms are super clean and have this great technology :-))
The food quality was good both times I went there but nothing comparable to the photos. When I checked them on yelp, those photos created great expectations for me. Unfortunately, at night the place is somehow empty, but the food was still good. The Turkish desert \"kunafe\" was one of the bests I had. Overall, it's OK but I think maybe the neighbour hood is more busy during the day. It's a good place to host your private parties. There is also a more formal dining area with live music for dinner, but both times I stayed in the cafe style area as I preferred a more low key place. The ambiance and decor is good too. Can sometimes be dead but I hope it picks up as it has good potential. I suggest trying the place at least once. But try multiple small dishes for sure, instead of one big one. The humus was good too, the tabuli was so so."}
{"text":"Spacious and bright cafe with great food selection. Ordered their flat bread and turkey breast salad . Pretty good but I was hoping  there was more figs in the salad :P
The coffee was very mini. If u like coffee u might wanna order two."}
{"text":"Love the food here, so tasty and fresh. My only complaint is no one ever picks up the phone! I can never order takeout because the phone is never answered, morning, afternoon, evening never!"}
{"text":"After bringing out one plate waited 20 min to get the second dish. My food got totally cold while waiting for my coworkers dish. 
It's not even busy - there's only 5 other tables with 6+ staff here. Not good at all... 
Had enough time to write this review and We are still waiting."}
{"text":"This is a late review as I've been here on May 1 (that is 2 months ago).  My hubby always want to try this restaurant, so finally we went there on sunday and had a late lunch.  First of all I love the setting, very relaxing and clean.  Wi-fi is very fast, so u can spend hours here.  Both of us ordered a sandwich and salad.  Mine was egg salad with croissant and steak sandwich for hubby, both sandwich comes with salad.  I love both sandwiches esp the bread itself were so good!  As for the salad, the potato salad was good but the other one was even better (but I don't remember what salad is it, just remember with corns and beets).  As for dessert, we had lemon tart and pistachio cake, and hubby ordered a set with a scoop of hazelnut gelato and a cup of espresso. We really enjoyed our meals alot and definitely will go again very soon!


Last saturday after having dinner with my friend, we want some dessert after, so I brought my friend to Beiruti again.  This time we had 3 cakes- Cheesecake (red), pistachio and dark chocolate with pistachio mousse.  Also we ordered pineapple and coconut gelato.  Everything is so good and my friend immediately fell in love with this place.  We stayed for 3 hours and had a great chit chat time!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. They have any Lebanese authentic food you can think of and it's all sooooo good. They had foul mddamas the way my uncle from Beirut makes it with tahini. We went there for breakfast and literally ordered two of everything. My fav was the foul and the knefe. It was sooooo good I wish I lived there to go every day :("}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting Beiruti and I've wanted to go since it opened! Let me start by saying the ambiance is amazing. I love a place with beautiful fixtures, it adds a lot to the experience and I am passionate about interior design so it makes a difference to me personally. Food wise; Their trout salad was good. I found their selection of food limited as mentioned by others, but hopefully they will expand as they grow as a business. This place has a lot of potential in my eyes. In terms of dessert, their gelato flavours are interesting: I like the mix of Middle Eastern influence with traditional gelato flavours. For example, their rose water pomegranate flavour (which complemented nicely with mango by the way.) Or their ashta flavour! Their macaroons are also great. Good consistency and good flavours. I tried the Coconut Mango (my fave!), Cherry Vanilla, and Lemon Raspberry. Though a bit pricey (If you went often it would run your bank account pretty dry), I loved the fusion of \"French-Lebanese\" with \"Modernized Café\"."}
{"text":"Great coffee, lots of space and tables. Just a nice way to spend with friends. The other side if the restaurant but the bakery itself is massive. Def have to try the desserts next time !"}
{"text":"Thought I would check this place out based on all the hype in the reviews..

Service: very helpful and friendly staff
Atmosphere: clean, upscale trendy cafeteria like atmosphere with modern decor

Food (Mains): I ordered the Tuscan flatbread which came with a small soup or salad. $14-$16? The flatbread was delicious and a good portion (think small size pizza with premium toppings). The Lentil soup was good as well, however, I was expecting more of a kick from it. 

I also ordered something that looked like a lamb quesadilla. The flavours were delicious and it also came with a soup or side salad for $14-$16? It was extremely flavourful, but I felt like I couldn't justify the price point for the portion of this item on the menu.. 

(Dessert): Their cakes are delicious as well. Only $4 each when you purchase with a main. I had a few items from their case and to be honest, I don't think you can go wrong with their desserts.. The espresso cake and this ganache chocolate cake with pistachios were my favourite.

Coffee: I ordered a caramel latte based on their recommendation - unfortunately I was a little disappointed with it as it was on the super sweet side and overpowered the coffee. I know, probably my fault.. If I didn't want sweet, I should order regular coffee. Just a point, I do order mixed coffee based drinks once every so often and even had someone else who drinks those fancy drinks try it, and we both agreed it was too sweet.. Maybe I will try it half sweet or 1/4 sweet next time. 


All in all, a trendy cafe with good food and great service. Great for business lunch or a casual first date.. just remember, this is not an average priced establishment.. prices tend to by higher here."}
{"text":"If you are not Lebanese don't go to this restaurant but if you happen to end up there NEVER sit in the \"dining room\". You will be unpleasantly surprised how much you have to pay for food you did not like. 
No wonder all the customers were in the take-out section. At least there you see what they serve you and can ask to change your order and it is 1/3 of the price you will pay on the dining area.
Otherwise it is very clean place.
We will never go back."}
{"text":"Lovely place for breakfast and lunch. The food is delicious and the place is quite. I ordered egg omelet with ham and cheese, it turns out with white bread, butter, jam, and sweet fruit. Staffs are also nice and friendly. It's a good place to rest and enjoy with friends."}
{"text":"Good ambiance . Fast service . Got the hummus and fatoosh tawouk. The meal only came with 4 small bites of chicken and the rest was all salad and  was also heavy on vinaigrette . Would come back to try other things on the menu. The bathroom and kitchen look relatively clean . The service could be friendlier !!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food was fresh and tasty, not your ordinary Lebanese shawarma shop. 

There are two aspects to this spot. There's a cafe with sandwhiches and desserts and then a full blown restaurant.  The place is new, and beautifully decorated on the restaurant side.  The staff were warm, friendly and hospitable. The meat is halal.

We had the sojouk ground beef rolls and cheese rolls for appetizers and they were very tasty. I recommend them both. Check out my photos. I had this yogurt meatball soup. A strange combination but an acquired taste that you will end up enjoying. The food was filling. 

They stated on the weekends they have musical performances. 

I recommend this place.

BEWARE: some of the items in those fancy photos are included at the cafe and not the restaurant, or are only available with catering and not available at the cafe or restaurant."}
{"text":"The meals were pre-made, so they were just heated up and brought to our tables. I ordered this cheese bread thing... the cashier told me it's \"spicy cheese on bread\". Yup, it wasn't spicy at all (but still a nice snack) LOL

I also tried the gelato. It tasted great but it wasn't special enough to make up for the $4 I paid for ONE scoop.

My favourite part of this cafe is its ambience. It's a great place to chat with a few friends or to study. Also, the salads look amazing (something I hardly ever say) so I think I'll order one of those if I come back."}
{"text":"I wish we took pictures! We can here for one of our friend's birthday for Brunch. We were a larger group so I guess they set us at one of their event rooms. There was a lot of miscommunication which kind of ruined the experience a bit but other than that the food here was amazing. 

We thought we were going to get a la carte stuff from the cafe but that was not the case. Our friend accidentally ordered everyone the 55 per person fixed menu. She thought she was just ordering for her family but the food came like a family style way. Food would be placed in the center of the table and we would help ourselves. 

The miscommunication between the server and us was quite frustrating because when we were ready to order, he said that the order was in so we really wasn't sure what was going on. The huge bill at the end was a super surprise. It was just one of those things where we wished we were informed first and confirmation would have went a long way too. It was 11am and with that amount of food coming, we could have been full the whole day. 

Don't get me wrong, the food was amazing. I just wished the server communicated more to us because the whole party was not down or prepared for that kind of feast so early in the day. There was times where he was unsure but when the food came it was already too late to cancel the expensive fixed menu.

The private dining area was beautiful, the lighting pieces and gallery was admirable. 

Washrooms are super clean and fancy.

Cafe portion of the restaurant-will definitely try another day. Their sandwiches and desserts look so scrumptious! I had a chai latte that the server \"let me order\" aside from the fixed menu. Was delicious too, best chai latte hands down. 

For the fixed menu, they also had kid friendly plates consisting of fries and chicken fingers/nuggets, also comes with juice for them just in case anyone was wondering if this place was kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. The Americano is essential whenever I go (basically an espresso coffee no cream or sugar) it's a little out of the way from where I live but definitely worth the drive. A great place to meet up with friends, hold a small business meeting, or grab a quick brunch. 

Recently celebrated a birthday in the dining area which is the other side of the cafe, we had 8 adults and 5 kids there and had a feast! 

*Warning* had no clue what type of cuisine the food was later found out it was Armenian

We ordered off a set menu there was a $35 $45 or $55 menu. And the word \"meeza\" showed up a lot I recommend not getting the $55 menu unless you have 20 people going. The food was great, but it was different. Different as in I thought these little sausages were gonna be salty but they were sour. Different."}
{"text":"I wanted to give zero star but no such option!

Was there on Saturday around 10am. There was no sign saying the opening time outside, nor any open sign.

I only found out it is opened by the website or yelp here and I could open the door.

It was almost empty with only one customer and the other looks like a staff taking break.

The dessert selection was alright, but I could not see anything almost from the fogged display.  The staff (who was keeping her poker face from start to end), did not even offer me a napkin to clean off the condensation from the display case.

The desserts almost tasted all the same (bought 4 different ones to try) and they were expensive at this quality.


Did I mention the staff was keeping poker face the whole time?? So customer service is nada as well.


There is no reason for me to go back or to recommend any of my friends to come here."}
{"text":"We had a poor experience here because of the cashier. We ORDERED two Beiruti coffee, one ham and cheese crepe, one Parisienne crepe, and one Beiruti crepe. We were CHARGED for FIVE Beiruti coffee, TWO Parisienne crepes, and one Beiruti crepe. We RECEIVED ONE Beiruti coffee, two Parisienne crepes, and one NUIT DU LIBAN . It took fifty minutes to even get our last crepe and we were the second party to arrive after opening. A large party that arrived after us received their food in a very timely manner.

When we did receive our Beiruti coffee, we were not shown HOW to properly serve and drink it, until our waitress saw the mistake.

For what it's worth, the food and coffee tasted great. Our waitress was extremely helpful, helping us get our food and coffee, and fixing our bill. Also, their Wi-Fi was great for allowing us to type this review!"}
{"text":"Beiruti Grand Cafe does have a lot of potential. 

The interior is just so spacious but it just feels like something is missing. The decoration is like work in progress and they had been open for months?!

The dessert looks wonderful but just lack labeling. For new customers like myself, I don't really know the name and ingredients of those beautiful pastries/cakes in the display case. That chocolate thing looks good? That is like a mango mousse because it is yellow? The green most be pistachio?!

We ordered Marraskesh Mint Tea ($2.50), Macchiato ($2.75) and Pistachio Mousse ($6) which were delivered to our table after we paid at the cash.

The Pistachio Something was really delicious! Nutty and has a layer of cherry jello filling and topped with some cherries.

The tables and chairs here are really \"plasticky\" and IKEAish which I won't associate that with a \"Grand\" Cafe. Maybe the nicer ones are still on back orders?! They did spend quite a bit on the faucets in the washrooms as they are Dyson Airblade Tap with a price tag of close to $2000 each!!  http://www.dyson.com/hand-dryers/airblade-tap.aspx

Beiruti Grand Cafe is worth coming back again for their dessert and some quiet time with friends. I probably will be back."}
{"text":"Ordering off their menu (not the pre-made sandwiches) was a good call. I can't compare to their pre-made stuff, but the food was very, very good. However, it was SO incredibly busy at lunchtime and it literally took us close to 1hr to get our food. But the food was so good, it redeemed itself; I would come back, just in off hours."}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is great and even those you need to go up to the counter to order, service is still wonderful. You can take a look at what's prepared in the display windows as not all menu items are always available but if you look even slightly confused, the girls behind the counter will guide you through the ordering process. Once you have paid for your order, you get a sign with your order number and food will be delivered to your table. There are lots of good healthy options here and the desserts are fantastic. I haven't had a chance to try their gelatos yet but will be coming back to try when the weather is warmer."}
{"text":"The food and service was very good. You can tell the restaurant is still a little new because many staff was still in training. They were all very kind and provided good customer service. We visited this place due to positive reviews from others, it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was like a upscale cafeteria which was nice and relaxing. It did not feel too formal. The sandwiches and salads were presented nicely. We were a bit confused about how the menu worked. The price for the lunch sandwich is approx 10-12$ which is still a little expensive but the quality was good. 

Get the cakes!! My friend had the espresso cake that looked like a square and it was amazing! I had the fleur de cao and it was really good as well if you like pistachio and rich dark chocolate. 

We will return at least for the cake!!"}
{"text":"Completely disorganized. Waited over 45 minutes for 3 dishes. The restaurant was half full. After asking about the status of our food, they refused to apologize for the delay and simply said the food would be coming.

No communication from staff, and terrible service. 
Would never return here again."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch. I had chai Latte and it taste soooo good. I loved their Provençal Salad, the grilled eggplant but not enough goat cheese w/c is my favourite.  lots of parking."}
