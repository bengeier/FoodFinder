{"text":"Love the mushroom risotto and a1 burger. This is a great to go to place in the area. Great mussels, better price during happy hour."}
{"text":"After car shopping all day, my boyfriend and I wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner. I got the rueben sandwich and it was the best rueben I ever had. My boyfriend thought his shrimp pasta was subpar. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, we never had an empty drink. However, we were the only ones in the restaurant without a bottle of wine at the table so when I saw the manager touch every table besides ours I was baffled! Even when she dropped our food off it was awkward and we seemed unwelcome. We will not return and will not be telling our friends about it because they probably wouldnt be welcomed either. We are a younger couple so maybe we looked like we didn't belong but I work in the restaurant business and we both know how to appropriately tip! I feel bad for the waitress because a lot of guests would lower their tip because of this. But she was awesome and got over a 20% tip. Kudos to her for being appropriately trained!"}
{"text":"Love the pasta! Salads are great, too! Other than that, the menu items are just \"ok\", hence 4/5 stars. Cool environment- love the fireplace!"}
{"text":"Went there recently for a Christmas party; it was the first time any of us had been there and we were pleasantly surprised. The food was very good. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with fries. Other people ordered burgers or steak sandwiches, and they raved about their selections. Best fries I've had from a restaurant in a long time. Some of the entrees are a little pricey but seems like the food is worth it. The drinks I ordered (smashed cherry & apple cider sangria) were amazing.   Our server was friendly but I wish she had been around more, especially at the end of the night. Also, she was done with her shift before we were done with dinner & drinks. I asked the bartender if she was still around or if we should order drinks directly from the bar. The bartender sent over another server to help us out. Not really a big deal but it would have been nice if our orginial server told us she was leaving and so-and-so was taking over.   Overall, it was a good experience - great food, average service."}
{"text":"Good Steak house burger. Wife enjoyed crab cakes. Located in same plaza as Dive Bar. If I had to choose between the two I'd go with Bonnie and Clyde's. Both places are good though."}
{"text":"Good place to grab lunch.  The menu had a nice selection and the atmosphere was nice. Good portion sizes for the price.  Public enemy #1 burger was great. Service was good. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Our meal was okay. I had the Scottish salmon, my daughter had the steak sandwich and my husband had the fish sandwich. My salmon lacked flavor. I had to salt and pepper it. My daughter enjoyed her sandwich. My husband's fish was cold. There are so many restaurants in the Cranberry/Wexford area to choose from. That being said my experience here was mediocre. Glad I tried it out but won't be back."}
{"text":"Different place, nice to see this in the area. Went here for lunch, wasn't crowded (almost empty).  Food was good and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Third trip here; we love this place! They have the absolutely best wedding soup I've ever had. The meatball and salad appetizer is a nicely balanced offering: a perfect jumbo meatball in a tasty tomato sauce topped with freshly shaved parmesan cheese. The salad is a true complement, and the bonus is a portion of tangy homemade ricotta cheese.  Today I decided to try the Pittsburgher burger, which is topped with blue cheese, grilled onions, coleslaw, and pierogis. It sounded like fun, and the burger was tasty and cooked perfectly medium rare, but the dish was a purely conceived mess. A \"Pittsburgh\" dish should have had Primanti's-style coleslaw, and it was impossible to eat the different items together, even with knife and fork."}
{"text":"Went there for the Happy Hour with hubby.  We were seated at the b&c area, the atmosphere was pleasant and d√©cor elegant and attractive.  I had a Strawberry Mojito and it was nicely done.  Fried zucchini was delicious, wings with garlic parmesan were amazing.  Mussels were not meaty, which was a disappointment and the only reason I wasn't giving five stars.  But for $5 an appetizer and half-priced drinks, my husband and I had a wonderful date night without breaking our bank.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Was finally able to stop in to B&C's for lunch a few days ago.  The service was less than impressive, and there were not many customers.  Maybe 10 tables with 2-4 people in what is now a good size establishment.   My friend and I were seated in the back of the room with the fireplace, right beside a bunch of empty tables and a large hole in the wall with cold air blowing through.  It was chilly outside at the time, too, so it wasn't pleasant.  Why they gave us that particular table, I'll never know.  It took 15 minutes for someone to take a drink order, and it wasn't even the server.  It was a manager.  Our waitress eventually did come around and had zero personality.  I ordered the strawberry salad and my friend got the steak salad.  These dishes, at lunch time, took way too long to come out.  We ended up being in a restaurant that was nearly empty at lunch time for over 90 minutes.  Food-wise, the salads were excellent.  The strawberry salad was the best I've ever had.  The candied almonds and dressing were a delicious combination.  My rating is based on how delicious the food was, but the customer service and timing of the food really has to step it up.  Blue Water Tavern, the restaurant that was in the space before, had horrible customer service and timing issues.  It was a little too reminiscent of this previously horrible restaurant, so B&C should be working their tails off trying to change patron's minds about frequenting this area.   I will take my husband back to B&C's, but if the food takes forever to come out when he is there, I can guarantee he won't want to go back."}
{"text":"We went to Bonnie and Clyde's for the first time on Wednesday, August 7.  We were a party of 4, we ordered drinks (I think 2 of them came from the bar), 2 appetizers, and 4 dinners.  Jason was our server.  We arrived around 7:00 pm and left around 8:30 pm.  The decor is pretty cool, a lot of gangster stuff, but NOT presented in a cheesy, junky, TGIF's kind of way, very stream-lined and modern and classy.  The food was wonderful.  It was presented beautifully and tasted great.  All 4 of us were very happy.    Our server Jason is the best server I've EVER encountered in a restaurant in the Pittsburgh area; and I was a server myself for a few years, so I'm a very picky and demanding customer when it comes to how I rate the quality of service I receive.  He was friendly, professional, quick-witted, and positive-spirited.  He made recommendations, he \"bantered\" with us, none of our drink glasses were ever empty and none of our dirty plates lingered on the table for more than 1-2 minutes.   I was especially thrilled that the food runner did not \"auction off\" our food as so many food runners in so many other establishments do.  I had had a really bad day, so I entered Bonnie and Clyde's with watery eyes from crying for a couple hours and left Bonnie and Clyde's with a spring in my step.  The only comment I have to write that isn't a positive comment is that they turned the music off and put the Pirates game on so that the whole area we were in could hear it.  Uhhh... Despite how it seems, not everyone in Pittsburgh cares about sports.  Luckily the volume wasn't overwhelmingly loud, so it wasn't too distracting and we were almost finished with our meals anyway, but next time I'll be sure to request that we be seated somewhere without TVs."}
{"text":"We went to Bonnie & Clyde's for our first time this evening and it did NOT disappoint!  The atmosphere was cool, the staff was awesome, and the food and beverages were delicious.  I would definitely recommend this place and plan to return myself!"}
{"text":"Bonnie & Clyde's is a cool little place in Wexford with a nice selection of brews on tap in addition to a full bar and a decent wine selection.  The food is pretty good, especially for the lower prices, and features a pretty nice mix of salads, burgers and sandwiches, and the like.  The overall atmosphere and decor are cool and they really play up the Hollywood movie \"gangster\" vibe across the menu, artwork, etc...  Finally, the service was extremely good.  Our waitress was extremely nice, checked in on us at the right times but not too often, and was just generally very pleasant.  Definitely would go back again and would recommend as a good place to grab a beer and quick meal..."}
{"text":"Very good food and a nice menu. I'm glad we have something new to try. The pasta was excellent, I love the bruschetta, all the food at our table looked great."}
{"text":"Stopped in a drink to check out this cute little hot spot! This place sure  has personality!!  Since we all ready ate dinner at another place we didn't order any food but everything we saw looked good .. steak and appetizers etc.  The service was good and the restrooms were clean. I will defiantly go back to try the food .."}
{"text":"I'm sad to hear the restaurant is closing after today. We always enjoy our meals here. My dinner was cooked perfectly. The only disappointment was my daughter's kids steak. Huge potato but a tiny little steak. It was a little over cooked as well. Everyone else enjoyed their meal. They were a little short of some amenities but considering they are closing I guess that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Filling the space once occupied by at least 3 restaurants in the last 10 - 12 years, Bonnie & Clyde's has completely remodeled the space.  The menu has a little bit of everything, though I was disappointed at the prices (seemed just a tad higher than the 'competition').  The staff is friendly and helpful.  If you're like me and want to get the best bang for your buck, go during happy hour when the appetizers and drinks are 1/2 off.  I had a burger the first time I was here -- ordered it medium and it came out more medium-well and the second time I had the ahi tuna app.  Both were good, but nothing extraordinary.  I plan on heading back in a couple of weeks to try on of the entrees.  I just hope that the overhead and the remodeling costs don't overburden them.  They can hopefully take advantage of the summer 'car cruise' crowd, but I have a feeling they will be selling more burgers and fries than crab cakes and filet."}
{"text":"The review I posted was cross listed for another bar.  The server at b&c was awesome.  Never waited for a drink."}
{"text":"This place has a nice relaxing atmosphere it. I find their food is very consistent. I've had many different things off the menu and I have found them all to be well prepared. The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a reservation at another restaurant fell through. Nice place to have some drinks and watch a game. They have several big screen tv's. We tried the big kahuna pork chop and strawberry salad. Both were excellent. The pork chop was HUGE and was cooked perfectly. Service was attentive and excellent. Overall, a pretty good choice with great food, very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Have been many times and the food is great.  Severs and staff always attentive and helpful,  went today for Mother's Day and buffet was awesome!  We had the best server ever, Melanie!  She went above and beyond!  If you go, ask for her you will get the best service!"}
{"text":"Wife and I wanted to try some place new and ended up here.  A pleasant surprise.  This was a good place to eat.  We started off with the fired zuchinni.  Lightly battered, lightly fried.  Topped off with a mild marinara sauce that complimented the zuchinni well.  Then we tried soups.  My Italian Wedding Soup was packed with meatballs and chicken, and was very flavorful.  I wouldn't say it was the best I've had, but very good.  The wife had French Onion Soup and reported that it was very beefy and oniony (which means she likes it!!).  Then came our entrees.  I had the 10 oz Strip.  Cooked just like I like it, and a great texture.  Not a GREAT steak, but again, very good.  And I liked the Wild Mushroom Risotto very much.  Once again, not the best I've had, but very good.  And the wife's Filet was gone in no time.  Overall, a very good place to eat, and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Bonnie and Clyde's is a fantastic restaurant not only is the food amazing but it's the most kid friendly restaurant.  We recently moved to the north hills from Houston tx and we have a son who is autism spectrum Bonnie and Clyde's is always super friendly and never minds when our son runs in and picks his own table.  The restaurant staff is accommodating and so wonderful.  Not to mention the food is delicious, fresh, and always perfect.  We love this place."}
{"text":"Husband and I were there for dinner last night. For appetizers we split a half-dozen oysters. They were probably the best freshest blue point oysters that we've ever had anywhere.  There were the standard cocktail sauce and some kind of peppery vinaigrette sauce with it that was fairly interesting. My husband had a crabcake for dinner which she finished with relish and I had The seared scallops which were done perfectly. The scallops had some kind of Really delicious marinated grape tomatoes on the same plate. They were totally yummy. My husband's wild mushroom risotto was pretty good.  Service was good.  Jason had extensive knowledge of the menu and was very friendly.  Food was excellent although I thought somewhat overpriced.  We would go back if in the area.    Minor suggestion, cocktails should be served with a cocktail napkin at the table."}
{"text":"Cool ambience. Great cocktails. No vegetarian entrees??? Boo for that. I won't be back until you can feed me something other than zucchini planks."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. Food came out barely Luke warm. Really not much to write about. Overall it is a 5 maybe 6 out of 10"}
{"text":"My fiance took me here for my birthday last month.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the servers are all dressed in black shirts with red ties and the ambiance of the restaurant is darker and has a flavor of the 1930s Bonnie and Clyde gangsters.  I'd recommend going here for that alone.  The food was very delicious.  I rarely order steaks, but ordered one here topped with crumbled blue cheese and a side of wedding soup.  The steak was cooked perfectly and seemed to melt in my mouth.  Soup was decent as well.  My fiance ordered a salad and thoroughly enjoyed her meal as well.  She ended up purchasing me a bourbon and honey based cocktail.  It really hit the spot being a hard liquor drink but having a sweet side to it.  Overall really enjoyed my experience here.  It's a little pricier than what I typically try to spend on a meal but the food and the atmosphere make it worth it.  Definitely a place to consider when wanting to go out somewhere nice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A friend and former colleague of mine invited me to dinner at Bonnie & Clyde's with her husband and daughter. This was my first time here and their second. Conveniently located in busy Wexford, Bonnie & Clyde's boasts a decent sized menu with something for nearly every type of appetite.   We dined on a Thursday night around 7p. The restaurant was not completely full, but busy with other diners coming and going - we did not have or need a reservation. We were seated in a booth in there main dining area. My biggest gripe with this room and it was immediately noticeable, was the fact that it is not insulated. The temperature in the room was not consistent. At times, there was a hot (and I mean hot) draft coming from the heating system. When the thermostat kicked off, it got noticeable cooler very quickly.  Two of us ordered their house chardonnay which was quite pleasant and appropriately priced at $6 for a glass. One of the other guests enjoyed a beer, although I'm not sure the cost.  For an appetizer, a couple of us shared a plate of their calamari. It was lightly breaded, not greasy, and served with slivered banana pepper rings and a sweet dipping sauce.   For our entrees, three of us ordered a salad. Two steak salads (although we swapped chicken for steak) and I think the other guest ordered a salmon salad (but served with chicken breast). I enjoyed my steak salad, but I definitely added a bit too much ranch dressing which overpowered what could have been a relatively healthy meal. Instead of fries on top of the salad, they placed onion bits. The size of the salad (something I always question when ordering) was decent. There really wasn't anything unique about the salad to make me think \"Wow, this is amazing!\"  We finished our meal with a couple coffees, no dessert.  Service - 4 Atmosphere - 2.5 Food - 3"}
{"text":"We had dinner here here a few months ago and the food was very good. Service was also pleasant. I have not visited in the evening yet to see the \"nightclub\" atmosphere but we did enjoy our dinner. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place.  Service is exceptional, place is very clean, food is quite good (best bruschetta ever) and terrific live music.  The owners know how to run a restaurant.  The outdoor porch and fireplace are cozy.  If you are looking for a Mortons Steak or Ruth's Chris, you wont get it.  BUT, what you will get is well worth the price and much better than what you get at other comparable restaurants.  Creative menu - the meatball appetizer is our favorite."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 6 and we were seated right away. Wasn't feeling to adventurous so we both got Burgers. Very good burger that didn't fall apart and the fries were cooked just right. The zucchini was good but could've been cooked a little longer. My only gripe was the beer glasses were dirty and smelt a little funny."}
{"text":"Love this place - been there 4 times - 2 for lunch and 2 for dinner. The appetizers are great and very filling, good salads and burgers, friendly servers with a festive atmosphere especially in the evening. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Bonnie & Clyde's on Saturday night.  The place was packed at 7:30 and the wait for a table was over 1 hour.  We decided to come back on another night.  Sunday turned out to be not as busy.    B & C's has almost gone over board on the \"gangsta\" theme.  Be sure to note the car and it's driver out front.  The menus have the appetizers listed as \"Petty Crimes\", salads are called \"The Big House\", pastas are \"Wise Guy\", seafood is \"Swimming with the Fishes\" and the shtick goes on.  As for the interior, some walls are red, some are a brushed metallic color.  Under the bar glows in green light.  We got a cozy booth complete with a plaque highlighting the career of \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd.  Servers are dressed in all black with deep red neck ties.  They are billing da joint was part restaurant/ part nightclub.  They have a huge bar and flat screen TV's scattered about and a DJ booth sits overlooking the dining room.    For our meals, BJ got the \"Clyde Barrow\" bleu cheese sirloin.  The prime sirloin was smothered with melted bleu cheese and served with a baked potato and vegetable.  He really enjoyed his steak and so did I!  I opted for a single crab cake dinner.  It was served with poblano corn salsa and \"Bugsy\" secret sauce.  For my sides, I got the risotto and green beans.  For $2 extra, I got a salad and BJ got wedding soup.  We both thought our meals were very good.  His steak was perfectly cooked and had a lot of flavor.  His only complaint was temperature of a couple items.  His soup was luke warm and his potato wasn't very hot.  I thought my crab cake wasn't very fat, but still loved it, the seasoning, the sauce.  I am adding it to the list of my favorite crab cakes.  Not the best ever, but great in a different sort of way.  Plus, my meal was almost more than I could eat.    BJ did make mention of his issues with his meal and our server sent a manager out right away.  Our server was really great.  We really like this new joint and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner. Blue cheese sirloin was fantastic. Zucchini appetizer was great too!!"}
{"text":"No idea why we've never been here before.  We came here for my husband's bday and the reservation was easy to make.  We sat on one of the counter height tables at the bar area.  There are 2 other more private dining areas also.  Our server was very nice, funny, and knowledgeable.  I get the whole bonnie & clyde theme and the cool wall decor with dean martin and al pacino.    We shared the deep fried zucchini and spicy mussels for appetizers.  They were both ok.  Zucchini was light.  The mussels were really tiny, but the spicy diavolo sauce was good.  May sound strange but the salad dressing was delicious.  I had italian, my father in law had balsamic and my aunt had the strawberry one and all of us agreed that it was one of the best salads we've ever had.  It comes with red onions, parm cheese, and grape tomatoes (in case anyone is curious).    For my entree, I had the cajun pork chop with andouille sausage, shrimp and brussel sprouts.  I got the pork chop med well, but regret it while cutting the meat bc it was tough.  My husband had the big kahuna pork chop with the horseradish in medium, and he said I should've had mine cooked medium.  The flavors were really good for both.  The big kahuna was not spicy.  The cajun was just the perfect spice, and I wanted more of the sauce.  I highly recommend the pork chop.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals, which were: chicken milanese, chicken parm, rib eye, and salmon.  For my husband's bday, they gave him a free slice of chocolate cake with chocolate icing.  It was a huge slice!  Delicious!  The other option was a cannoli I think.  My aunt and uncle got the scoop of blackberry cabernet sorbet, and that was equally delicious but lighter.  Also refreshing!  Btw, I also like their lime margarita on the rocks.  I would definitely come back.  Need to try the martini and meatball wednesdays.  check out the website for all their events."}
