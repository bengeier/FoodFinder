{"text":"Keep away from this place. We came during the jazz festival. After drinks and bread were served, we waited for an hour then the waitress just found out our order was forgotten by the kitchen. Finally we missed the show and got the food including the rotten salad and dried meat."}
{"text":"We were walking around the place, with tons of pricey food trucks and decided we'd rather come inside for a meal...

It's bistro food, more like a tourist trap place. The service is friendly and the food is average. 

We ordered the fried calamari, which is always a safe choice, and it was good. You know when you see I ordered fried calamari in my reviews, it's because there is nothing else special on the menu ;) and you can rarely go wrong with fried calamari.

For the main, I ordered the duck confit, which was dry and came with some berry sauce, it was sweet and weird. I did not like it too much. We did split a bottle of wine 3ways for about 40$ which is a good deal."}
{"text":"Tourist trap! 

Superb location and nice settings. Food is barely OK, and service is very amateur. The tartare had been \"proceed\" to finely, a long time ago. There are now good alternative around there. OK for a drink outdoors and the fried calamari is decent. Walk a block around for your meal."}
{"text":"Joli petit bistro situé au métro place des arts, en face de l'endroit ou jadis se trouvait le spectrum. 

Le décor est moderne et accueillant, un peu lounge. L'accueil est chaleureux. La vue sur le quartier des spectacles est superbe !
Nous ne savons pas trop que prendre, alors nous demandons conseil au serveur, qui ne semble pas trop passionné par quelque chose en particulier. Soit qu'il n'a pas goûté ou bien il n'aime pas. 
Nous optons pour les calmars frits en entrée, servis avec une mayonnaise maison, qui sont LES MEILLEURS que j'ai eu la chance de manger. Il s'agit de VRAIS morceaux de calmar enrobés d'une légère panure de style tempura. Aucun goût caoutchouteux, j'aime ça !

Pour le repas principal, je choisis la bavette. Elle est assez ordinaire, sans saveur et la  pièce n'est pas tellement tendre. 

Le prix dudit repas est assez dispendieux pour un steak moyen et des calmars. Je ne sais pas si j'y retournerais bien franchement. Probablement pour un 5 a 7, mais pas pour le repas. Ils ont de bons spéciaux après 22h, mais c'est un peu tard pour moi."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here, wife and l on vacation for the F1 race, so the city was abuzz with activity and closed down streets for the many festivals nearby.
So because of that, service was a bit slow understandably, our server apologized for that, so no knock there. Prices weren't too overly expensive, as we ordered up a bottle of Moet & Chandon Imperial to go with our fantastic French Onion soup and a cheese plate, salad and a veggie platter. Salad was good as well. Great atmosphere, (we dined al fresco) friendly staff, l recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great dinner and service last night. This is a non for profit restaurant that funds things like the Jazz festival. Our drinks, steak, veg burger, fruit cup and cream brule were great before some Just for Laughs weekend shows."}
{"text":"Arrived late into the city and a group of us decided to eat here. Burgers, salad, chicken, and steak were delicious.  We were seated at a family style wood table with dripping wax candelabras and lights were low so an intimate ambiance. A few of my friends I was with were here before and said the food was still just as delicious as last time. Would go again, maybe for lunch to sit on outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews for this restaurant.  I have to admit that I live and work in the area, so I tend to stay away from it during prime tourist/jazz festival season since I can enjoy the restaurant at any time of the year.  While I can't comment on their food or service when they're running at full tilt, I would say it's not to be missed in the fall, winter, or even spring.  My experience has always been excellent and although the menu isn't inexpensive, I don't find that it's overly expensive for the quality of food and service that you receive.  Add the fact that it's a non profit and all the proceeds go to funding our amazing Jazz Festival every year, and it's a no brainer choice for a lovely meal in the Quartier des Spectacles."}
