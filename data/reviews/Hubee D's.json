{"text":"Totally turned off by the blue cheese mayo dip with not one sighting of blue cheese.  All of the sauces were, to put it mildly -- extremely disappointing.  They really need to work on the sauces.  Every single sauce was gooey and flavorless.  The wings deserve a more authentic pairing.  What's with wings and no real hot sauce option?  The salads were pretty good - chopped and goats cheese.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp.  The banana pudding pop was stellar.  I'm not a fan of desserts, but the manager offered it as a concession (very thoughtful, btw) for waiting a little long for my order.  I ordered two more and shared with my husband.  Will definitely return again for the banana pudding pop:-)"}
{"text":"best wings in town!  their signature Hubee sauce is addictive.  don't forget to try the homemade fried banana pudding."}
{"text":"I went with some colleagues today for lunch after hearing good things about Hubee Ds. I ordered boiled peanuts with my meal and they were brought out first which I thought was pretty cool! My colleagues enjoyed the boiled peanuts and I did too but I wouldn't have minded if they were a little saltier or had some kick to them.  There are no servers here, no tip on the receipt, no tip jar, and I didn't see any tips being left so I assumed that tips are not expected here. Someone please let me know if this is not correct.  When I was ordering the cashier told me that the boneless wings were just the tenders tossed in one of their sauces so I ordered a tenders basket which came with fries and cole slaw.   I believe that the fries are cut in store and were not bad, not great but I ate them all. I would say that the fries were my least favorite part of the meal. That is probably because I enjoyed the cole slaw. It was light-medium on the mayo which I liked. There was something green in the slaw as we'll but I couldn't tell if it was a jalape√±o, olive or some other pickle but it sure was good.  The chicken tenders were awesome, I probably could have eaten 10 of them as they were not heavily breaded and not greasy at all.  My colleagues ordered salads and seemed to like them although one was not super excited about the dressing that came with the Goat Island Salad.  I was happy to see that they had little containers with lids so that you could take some of their five or six sauces to go with you. The sauces were good although I was not thrilled with the buffalo sauce as I like mine spicy. I did enjoy the Hubees sauce and the jerk sauce. Honey BBQ was good and I forgot what the other was.  Overall it was an awesome experience and I was able to catch some of the ACC tournament on one of the TVs while catching se NFL free agency news on another. I will definitely be back to try the wings and eat more tenders!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for fast food. $9 bucks for chicken tenders, fries, drink. Food is good though."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the Rivergate Community! Love it! They even have craft beer! Love the country music too....."}
{"text":"Saw this place last week on another lunch visit and figured I would try it out today. Chicken tenders were dry and the fries were very, very soggy. The young lady at the register was pretty awesome though! I told her about the food and she replaced it with new food that was pretty much the same but hotter. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Needing a quick snack, we decided to try out Hubee D's. We shared a tenders basket and found the chicken to be fresh with a crunchy but not overly done crust. I tried each of the sauces and would have been content with any of them. The best part? THE FRIES ARE PERFECT!! Thin so they each have a good crunch - I could eat a bag of 'em! This place has the service and the food - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love their wings. I'm not a huge wing lover ( meaning I only eat them when I have a craving) but these my friends, I can eat everyday. They aren't super greasy, they are seasoned to perfection, and best of all they are reasonably priced. I just got the dry rub wings and tried each of their sauces on the side. IM ALL ABOUT THE BUFFALO! So so good. But in all honesty these wings are so good and tender you could eat them plain. That's how you know you found a good wing spot."}
{"text":"Nice people working here. Very good tea. But how sad... A fast- food look and the food? I tried the chopped salad with tenders. Good crunch to chicken, but very salty and it had that mass-produced processed taste. I converted to Ashley Farms long ago, and buy other  \"natural\" chicken. It's just hard to go back.   Plus, styrofoam cups, plastic to-go boxes... It's hard to feel ok about all this in 2013.   Then there's Boston Chicken, Rite Aid, and the departure of independent businesses.  Myers Park is a special neighborhood.  So many pretty homes... So close to uptown... So many civic leaders. This commercial area along Providence needs less chicken tenders and more tough love."}
{"text":"I could say 3.5 stars .  The food was surprisingly good, they serve beer and wine which is unusual for a fast food type place (with decent dining room seating) which caters to kids.  But it all works nicely here.  Large selection of sauces, and mostly chicken and salad food choices.  i had the Goat Salad with chicken, it was very good  but the french fries and the chicken on the child's plate for my granddaughter was even better... both were outstanding and a nice mustard sauce for the mini chicken fingers. They obviously went in business because they know how to cook chicken.  It works.  Parking is good, children got a token to exchange for their choice of free dessert -- a nice way to do it, if they eat their food, they can go back and get a treat.  Ice Cream Sandwich or banana pudding, or ?   the icecream sandwich was good, I tasted it.  Will return ---  hope they expand, it appears to be a chain.  A special plus was well designed restrooms, with working faucets, and towel dispensors and soap dispensors.  something I can't say for all such places."}
{"text":"Likes : The best chicken fingers I think that I've ever had! The wings, salads and wraps are pretty good but after having their chicken fingers I don't know how I could ever order anything else here! They have a great variety of dipping sauces but in my opinion the chicken fingers are best on their own!    Gripes: This place gets very busy on the weekends with limited seating inside and a long wait to order at the counter. I recommend calling ahead your order and getting it to go."}
{"text":"Needs more parking and wings could be saucier, but totally solid."}
{"text":"This is one of the better wings places that I've ever been to. They have a limited flavor selection but the flavors that they do have are quite good. They keep it simple which helps when trying to make menu decisions. The atmosphere is fairly relaxed and family friendly, but I also like to go there to watch NFL games. Overall I highly recommend this over BWW's"}
{"text":"Delicious ceasar wrap, tenders were scrumptious, fries were on point, and they have Mr. Pibb! Very friendly staff! Very clean!!! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner last night at Hubee D's and really enjoyed it! Ordered the grilled boneless wing basket...Cornbread was great, as well as the wings, coleslaw and fries. Luckily we left room for desert....Frozen Banana Pudding Pop did not disappoint, it is necessary for every meal. Do not skip it!  Customer service was top notch last night by all staff members. Will definitely return very soon!!"}
{"text":"I tried Hubee D's for the first time last week. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I had the buffalo chicken salad, it was very tasty. They served it with a piece of cornbread that was also tasty. The cornbread is so sweet it almost tasted like cake. My Hubby ordered the wings, he was satisfied. My son had the tender kids meal, he enjoyed it. The tenders were so fresh and juicy, and the fries were good and hot. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would like to know where this restaurant got started and do these people have tastes buds where they are from or are they people like The Hills Have Eyes movie and got nuked and now they can't taste a thing and eat whatever they can find.  Don't bother ordering the grease, they are generous enough to give you ample thin soggy cold fries to soak it up so it won't run all over your plate. At least make it thick cut fries, so it at least you can taste some potato flavor not just oil that you fried your chicken in as well. $6!?!? JUST for a chicken sandwich, you better put some lettuce, tomato, cheese or bacon on it or something, but nope, you get pickles and two strips of dried up chicken slathered in this grotesque pinkish mayo sauce. I know some of you people like no thrills eating, you'll eat bread and cardboard and be happy, but it's just chicken and bread and pickles! You mean you can't slap that together for less than 6 dollars? Oh man, the sauce!!! What were they thinking?! You came up with 7 different types of sauce, you can at least make one that tastes half way decent! I think one is vomit with hot sauce the other is vomit with bbq sauce and the other is vomit with mayo and another one is vomit with vomit, also theres another tangy jerk vomit.  There is one bright side to this restaurant are their wings, unfortunately, I must have gotten some deformed handicap chicken cause couple of wings were dried up and one was very tiny. Get them dried rubbed, don't get them tossed in vomit.  No sir,...I don't like it."}
{"text":"O.k so we decided to try this place since we love wings . well it was a big disappointment . we had the tenders and regular wings . the tenders taste like the use Cinnamon for one of there ingredients .gross . and as far as the wings I like them crispier personally . the French fries are good the the highlight of the meal ...oh and at a dollar a wing which is the highest I've probably ever seen they should at least be good there not there gross you can get better wings anywhere seriously and the number 1 combo has 6 wings really who eats just 6 wings and no other options for more In a combo ....don't waste your time or money ...."}
{"text":"This place is getting it right.  It's a big step above fast food and its obvious everything is made from scratch.  We got a big togo order with an assortment of a lot of different menu items.  Fresh cut fries were really good with a generous portion but like most fries, they didn't travel that well.   The tenders have just the right amount of breading to make them crispy but not to take away from the buttermilk marinaded seasoned chicken.  The wings were a big hit.  Slightly smokey with the dry rub, plump tender and juicy.  Had the hot sauce and the BBQ sauce and both were very good.  We will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Wow!  Still so impressed with Hubee D's. The staff are so, so friendly and efficient. I love the buffalo wrap and the fries are my fav anywhere. I've even changed my mind about the Hubee sauce - yum!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the chicken tenders and sauces. Lower for everything else as the fries are too skinny and no other outstanding sides."}
{"text":"Excellent for what they do: chicken \"tenders\" and wings. I highly recommend the kid's meal even if you're not a kid. $4.99 includes 2 chicken tenders, plenty of skinny fries, a small drink and a scrumptious dessert. Try the banana pudding pop, a cross between pudding and ice cream with a chocolaty tip."}
{"text":"Fall off the bone wings, awesome cornbread and semi decent fries. I really like their blue cheese sauce! Have only tried their sweet tea once, maybe it was an off day, but the tea was bitter. I wound up switching out for another beverage. Good place for the whole family or to grab your wings when football season is in swing!"}
{"text":"Service was very good.  Chicken was tender but a little rubbery.  I did like that the breading was a little lighter than most restaurants, not so caked on and dried out.  Pretty much all of the sauces were letdowns.  There was just something a little funky about the taste.    Boiled peanuts were good, as was the tea.  Fried banana pudding sounded interesting but it was nothing special."}
{"text":"We passed by Hubee D's one day, said \"What's that?!\", and then visited the next day to give it a shot when we were looking for a quick, cheap early dinner.    The menu is fairly simple -- all chicken-related -- but there's a little something for everyone: wings, tenders, boneless wings, sandwiches, salads, sides, and desserts.   You order at the counter, get a number, and then the food is brought out to your table, so at least you know it's cooked to order.    I tried the crispy tenders meal which included fries.  For a dollar more, you can get the platter which also includes coleslaw and cornbread.  I opted for the 4-piece tenders for $1 more than the 3-piece.  Unfortunately, what I got was about 3 1/3 tenders.  Like the chicken wings, I figured you could also get hot sauce on your tenders, so I requested that the tenders be tossed in their \"seriously hot.\"  Seriously, it's not that hot.  And I was charged an extra 50 cents. And they have five kinds of sauce (including buffalo hot sauce, which tasted the same) on the tables.  I basically paid 50 cents for the labor of someone putting sauce on my chicken that I could have done myself at the table.  And then another 20 cents for blue cheese.  All of which should automatically be included with ANY kind of chicken.    The tenders (all 3 1/3 of them) were very tasty and the buffalo sauce (that I could have just put on myself) was flavorful, too, although not very spicy.  The big handful of shoestring fries (with skins on) were very good, too.    I'm not a fan of chicken wings, but looking at the menu, they seemed a bit pricey (about a dollar a piece).  And their fried banana pudding sounded interesting...but not for $5 a pop.  Seriously?    Would I go back?  I might.  The food was good and fresh.  I'd know just to put the free sauce on myself, though, and next time I'd probably say something if I just got 3 1/3 tenders for the 4 that I paid for.  That should be part of their quality control, though, not mine.    I'm probably being generous with four stars, but three stars seemed too low.  It's probably more like 3 1/3."}
{"text":"So as a person w/o kids who generally focuses on healthy flavorful eating, this is not really the place for me.  The offer wings, chicken tenders (fried or grilled) and nuggets. They said that their crispy tenders are their most popular item so I gave them a try along with the Goat Island Delight salad they said was their best - a salad with craisins, almonds and champagne vinegarette. They seem to do a big business from the hospitals at lunch and their food comes out ultra quickly which is good if you're on the go. They seem to do a good job with training their employees.   I just wasn't crazy about the breading/seasoning on the chicken- it tasted a little bland/sour and when you say crispy, I guess I expected more crispy batter ala KFC on the outside and the batter was quite thin. The accompanying sauces named after various South Carolina places were boring (buffalo, jerk, bourbon, honey mustard, etc.) The best was the Old Edisto sweet honey BBQ sauce.    The salad was bland without the dressing but the dressing itself didn't complement the salad at all. The saving grace of the meal was the delicious cornbread which was sweet and moist, and the  frozen banana pudding pop in a dixie cup with caramel and chocolate, which incidentally is not a good thing to eat while driving. Consider yourself warned. It is, of course, absolutely delicious but despite being small (in a Dixie cup) it is quite dense and filling and I couldn't finish one.  Is this a great place for families with kids? Absolutely.  Will I be back? Probably not until I have a 4 year old I have to feed or I have a hankering for the cornbread or banana pudding pop."}
{"text":"First time here.  Fast.  Tasty.  Friendly. Cozy. Clean. Love love love this place.  New fave.  Goat island delight salad and grilled tenders w fries.   Perfect in all ways.  Xxx"}
{"text":"Had great expectations for this place. My wife loves tenders and she was not impressed. $24 for lunch and although the cole slaw was fresh it was vinegar based which taste sour. The fries were tasty but we hate shoestring fries, reminds us of Shake & Steak. Service was great though. Wanted to try fried banana pudding but $5! Played loud country music also, which we not fond of. Hubee D's please try harder"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with a dear friend (who's been there 3 days in a row) and the place is simply great. Large portions of tender grilled chicken with several different sides and pricing was more than reasonable. I intend to go back with my wife and several other friends. It was very clean and well-maintained and the manager made time to stop by our table and chat. A good expereince."}
{"text":"This is a good but not great chicken place with well polished design and delivery.  Dry rub wings were tasty, especially with the many sauces. Chicken tenders and nuggets had a lot of breading and were just OK.  Services was absolutely perfect, as we were checked up on at least 5 times during our 25 minute stay.  Kids meal was great. Lots of new HDTV. Hated the country music, but wife and kid liked it.  Parking lot was so tight I had to move my car even though both cars were inside the lines.  Would go back but not as a regular."}
{"text":"This place was great! Awesome chicken wings, amazing wrap and great service. I got  six tossed chicken wings in a mild sauce. They were perfectly dry rubbed with awesome flavor and are smoked before being fried. The mild sauce was delicious and topped them off perfectly. I also got a blue cheese chicken wrap that was as good as the wings. They put their delicious chicken tenders inside which is what truly makes the wrap delicious. Even their fries were delicious! The decor of the restaurant as well as the friendly service put this place into a five. Honestly I was gonna give them a four but thought they were being short changed by the overall three and a half they got on Yelp at the time of my visit. So I want to help them get to their well deserved four. Give this place a try"}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you get.   The food was good.   I loved the chicken strips and frozen banana pudding pop.   The restaurant is noisy.   Perfect for kids."}
{"text":"Great new place. A must try if you are ever in the area. Ambiance is very casual and laid back. The service is first class, cashier took the time to explain each of the seven sauces in great detail. Very engaging and energetic wait staff. Food was brought after a few minutes as everything is cooked to order. Food was fresh and flavorful sauce is not needed. Will return soon to try the many styles of dry rub wings."}
{"text":"Excellent service,staff was friendly and attentive.   Banana Pudding pop is cute and delicious !!!  We had the ck tenders basket and dry rub wings basket.  The corn bread is sweet and scrumptious. Cole slaw is fresh and lightly dressed but nothing special about it.  The chicken is really moist, not dry at all unlike other wing places. The breading is light. The dry rub wings is okay the meat is moist but the size is smaller compare to B dubs. Fries are crispy and well seasoned.   They have sauce bottles and a big roll of paper napkins on every table.  However for spicy lover like myself I was disappointed that non of their sauces are spicy.  Personally I like the bourbon sauce the best, the hubee sauces resembles chipotle ranch. Island jerk has a hint of smoky flavor.  Overall it's not bad, I will def come back for their tenders and that yummy banana pudding pop !!!"}
{"text":"Just your normal wing and sandwich place. Atmosphere was nice, staff friendly.  They do have lots of sauces, our favorites were the Island Jerk and Honey BBQ.  The Fried Banana Pudding was not what I expected: just battered bananas fried and placed on a plate with a small portion of normal banana pudding.  I would preferred just the normal pudding."}
{"text":"Food was amazing they checked back up on us and there is a paper towel roll. This place is great for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to trying this joint. I love a good fried chicken place & I thought this was going to be the bomb. The design & store layout was on point. I was so let down by the quality of food. The price was way too high for quality I would say is lower than Zaxbys."}
{"text":"I got wings to go. They were beautiful and I would have posted a photo had I not savagely inhaled them the second I got the box open. Most wing places undercooked the wings leaving them rubbery, these were golden crispy and gorgeous. I taste tested the buffalo, BBQ, and their Jerk sauces. I couldn't name a winner, they were all stellar. This was my first time here but it won't be the last.  Next time, I will also pick up a fried banana pudding. The cashier told me they batter and fry a banana and serve it atop a big scoop of banana pudding then drizzle chocolate and caramel sauces with a dusting of powdered sugar!!! Oh, Mamma!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to try what I heard was some pretty decent chicken. Hubee's did not disappoint. Went on a Saturday after and ordered some chargrilled tenders. Grilled chicken tenders are something I can't find anywhere but I wish were on everyone's menu.  The vibe was almost like a cross between fast food and a normal \"waited\" restaurant. I ordered at the counter but then was told to have a seat and they brought my food out to me on a tray with metal silverware. My food came up quick and was surprisingly tasty. The flavor reminiscent of coming off an outdoor grill. While the chicken was good, the sauces were actually the stars - all of them great. My favorites were the island jerk and the bourbon sauces. Both unique and worked well with grilled chicken.  I couldn't place my finger on the spices in the Hubee sauce but it's a strong sauce. The honey BBQ was more tangy than sweet but also pretty good. The hot sauce was hot sauce lol.  Overall I would definitely return. Might even go again tomorrow :).  Because grilled tenders"}
{"text":"Wanted to eat some good wings for dinner so I decided to check out a new place.  Hubee D's doesn't fry their wings, they smoke em.  Compared to other fast casual, counter service places I thought the wing prices were high.   I tried three different sauces and wasn't impressed with any of the them.  They weren't bad, but the dry rub blended with the sauce just didn't do it.  The wings were a bit tough, but with no crispiness.  If I'm not going to get the crispiness of the fryer, then the meat should be more tender.  Add on that they forgot to give me the blue cheese and we'll call it quits on this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for a quick lunch when I'm in the area. I typically order the fried chicken tenders and fries.  The tenders and fries have always been tasty and fresh.  Service is friendly and quick. The restaurant typically feels clean and well cared for.  My son is bigger now, but I remember being surprised they didn't have a baby changing area in the restroom, especially with the size of the restroom."}
{"text":"Chicken tenders were good but the sauces were not. The buffalo sauce has way too much vinegar in it. The fries were soggy. The coleslaw wasn't crunchy. And the cornbread was as sweet as candy. So, chicken tenders were the only good part, and they were really good. If the tenders weren't good I would have given a single star.  Service was kind of grumpy.  The place was clean."}
{"text":"Great, simple, food fast. Awesome fries, friendly service. Kid friendly, a bit more expensive than a Chick-fil-A but worth it."}
{"text":"I wanted something quick and inexpensive after a long day and decided to give this place a try. I got the chix tenders and fries meal and it was alright. The employees here are nice and helpful with any questions regarding the menu. The sauces are okay. The only issue was with the squeeze bottles containing the sauces. Some of them have buildup at the tip which can leave you with an unexpected mess if not careful."}
{"text":"This was the first time trying this place. I've seen it on the website for months. The manager and the cashier were extremely helpful in helping us with the menu! This place is great! I had a Cobb Salad with Crispy Chicken and my husband had the Seriously Hot dry rub wings!!! Topped it off with a Fried Banana Desert! This place is worth a shot! Guaranteed you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Love this place...hard to decide what to eat...probably my favorite is the honey bbq wings w/fries but salads are great too! Staff is always great."}
{"text":"Came back to update.  My family and I ate here again yesterday for lunch, and the fries were perfectly cooked, so maybe I just caught them on an off day before.  . My son got the banana pudding pop for dessert and loved it!  Chicken is so spot-on.  Thankful to find a place that doesn't cook the chicken into oblivion!  Lol"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service!  We have driven by many times on our way Uptown and wanted to try their wings.  So glad that we finally did. Their wings, tenders, and fries were fantastic.  The service at the counter and the tables was even better.  They stopped by our table multiple times to see how everything was and if we needed anything to the point where even my kids were impressed.  Its clear they do things right here.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We were in the area completing paperwork for our first home purchase. After hours of signing a stack of paper the size of my old math textbooks, it was too late to celebrate elsewhere. We decided on Hubee D's as we have been in the past and enjoyed it.   My go-to is the chicken tenders with fries; better than most I've had. Half way through our meal, the owner comes out with a plate of their fried banana pudding and congratulates us on our new home. A genuinely nice guy and very personable; which also proves true for most of the staff.   I enjoy the simple menu and the local brews they have on-tap (a small variety of wine is also available). I would love to see them improve their sauces by possibly adding seasonal or regional varieties."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken place. Definitely a step above the chain competitors.  Plenty of food both for adults and the kids meals.  Grilled chicken was very moist and flavorful. The chicken tenders were excellent. Nicely breaded and plenty of flavor.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant and will be visiting again."}
{"text":"It is a new chicken place in Rivergate.  Clean smaller restaurant. The food is good but on my trip I ordered Wings and well, I like my wings deep fried not smoked. I think the wings would have been better if they had a sauce that I liked. I prefer my Buffalo Sauce to be red pepper based.  I am certain I'll eat here again as I want to try their fried Banana Pudding and their pudding pop which my granddaughter enjoyed!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this place after hearing good reviews from my co-workers. It's a place that could easily be overlooked because it's a fairly new restaurant in CLT. After eating here once, I will definitely be back again! The service was fast and the food was hot. Great cole-slaw and cornbread! Being a southern girl I can't eat just anyone's slaw or cornbread but that wasn't the case here! It was great and I loved how they have their dipping sauce variety already at your table for dine-in. Eat here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hubee D's falls somewhere between fast food and fast casual. Everything is prepared fresh on-site and never frozen. They have wings, tenders, nuggets, wraps, & salads. Sides include fries, cole slaw, bananas, and corn bread. Desserts are frozen fried banana pudding and ice cream sandwiches. There are several sauces available at every table - jerk sauce, bourbon sauce, buffalo hot sauce, honey bbq, and Hubee D sauce (which tastes like a gourmet, smoked version of ChicFilA sauce). Overall, the food was good, though very little on the menu isn't fried. I would go back over ChicFilA or Zaxby' s, but the menu is limited enough that I'd really need to be in the mood for chicken or wings."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me I ask you smoke your wings?  They told me yes so I ask what type of wood do you used?After asking a few people took a wild guess and said Hickory."}
{"text":"Parking was interesting but I loved the fact their chicken tenders wasn't greasy like those fast food places. Their fries are yummy. Staff was nice as well. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Great food!  Finally a good casual place in Myers Park. Just chicken - tenders, wings, nuggets, salads and wraps.  The BEST fries anywhere!   We will be back. It will be a tailgating staple."}
{"text":"It cost over a dollar per wing. The hottest sauce was mild at best. There was a meager amount of blue cheese for what I paid, and it wasn't even chunky. Can't see myself ever returning."}
{"text":"This place has good wings, chicken tenders, fries and the fried banana pudding is a must try. They also have a good variety of sauces to. Nice place."}
{"text":"After a quick shift at work and I can't leave because of a meeting..I decided to try a place I saw a co worker was eating. I swear, I thought she was eating a burger and I had 'burger' on the mind.  Nope..they don't do burgers, but since I'm here, why not try something. I ordered the chicken tenders, something called Banana Pudding..something and cole slaw. Chicken tenders were that..chicken tenders. Spiced not too bold and not too weak, enjoyable. The only thing with me was.. I 'breathed' them in. They were done..gone..before the after taste set in. Note to self: Order a LARGER PORTION next time. Cole slaw. Though it was moist, it was as moist as I would have liked it to be but it did have a nice taste to it. The Banana 'whatever'. I had a taste for banana pudding which was my first mistake. I saw on the menu 'banana', and 'pudding'..so I put them together. Not what I was expecting but a VERY pleasant surprised. Nice on the outside and warm on the inside. Me thinketh this would do fine with ice cream..(2nd note to self.)  The place is large..though I didn't take a walk around. Do they have flat screen tv's? This would be the place to be during Panthers Home games..but it might get a little nosey after a touchdown.  I have to come again to this place..first time wasn't enough for me..needs further inspection."}
{"text":"We decided to give Hubee D's a try last night and my experience was surprisingly pleasant. If you are a fan of condiments than this is a good place for you. I got a basket of dry-rub wings and shoestring fries. Wings were a decent size and didn't taste like it's been sitting out on a heat lamp for too long. The fries reminded me of Steak & Shake but better. I didn't get any bread but those in my party that did said they really liked it. The customer service was great. Girl behind the counter knew we were new and gave us the run down. We also had several people check up on us. I rather have that than no service at all considering this is a fast food chain that's pretty impressive. So basically if you are in the mood for some good fast food in a Southern feel environment go for Hubee D's."}
{"text":"The staff here are so friendly! Stayed a little after closing time and they didn't rush us out the door instead they catered to our table. We got the wings dry rub and might I say it was good with the variety of different sauces they had to choose from for dipping. Loved their skinny cut fries and ranch sauce. I saw they even had craft beer but didn't have a chance to try some. Definitely bringing my family back here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had dinner here. I ordered the 12 PC wings and she ordered the 3 PC chicken strip basket. It was ok!! I've had better. It's an ok place to take kids but their chicken wasn't really all that. They need to step it if they want to make it there with Buffalo Wild Wings just down the block. I do have to say that their wings were a descent size thou."}
{"text":"We ordered 12 wings, a buffalo wrap, and kids chicken basket. I don't know where to start. First off, I didn't like the Country music blaring. The order took a while. The price was pretty steep... $1 a wing? With all the other places nearby you could get wings (Wing King, Buffalo Wild Wings, Wild Wing Cafe, Fuel Pizza, Friday's, Milanos, KFC, FATz, TIlted Kilt, Papa Johns...) why would you choose Hubee D's? The staff was nice, but circled our table like vultures. 4 people came by in literally 5 mins to ask how it was. The Wings were decent size and the hot buffalo sauce was really good, but the wings we not crispy and the greasy skin was not appetizing. Soggy wings = F-. The chicken tenders in my childs meal were cold and hard, but she is 2years old and ate them. The fries were greasy, cold. The wrap wasn't very good. Lettuce seemed old and not crisp. The cucumbers tasted as fresh as a subway. The highlight was the Hot Buffalo sauce.   The bottom line - Doesn't live up to the hype, overpriced, good Buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"I liked it, my daughter didn't. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich, she went with the fried chicken sandwich. Chicken tenders (grilled or fried) on a bun with a splot of Hubee D's sauce and pickle slices. Everything is made to order so it does take a few minutes if it's busy.  Fries? Excellent and fresh, the right salt. Cole slaw? Good and creamy. Cornbread muffin? Firm and tasty, very good. As for the sandwich, it was quite tasty and I'd absolutely have it again. The chicken was moist and there was enough of it. Several table sauces to choose from if you want to add. The Buffalo was too hot for me but the Hubee D's was perfect.  Service was good, though maybe too much. Each time one of the several folks passed by, they were asking if we needed anything. At least five times in fifteen minutes. They could use a \"do not disturb\" sign on the table.  Hubee D's has a big challenge competing in Rivergate with the Chick-Fil-A and McDonald's right nearby. For fast casual, there's also a pizza place, a sub place and Salsarita's. And more upscale includes Friday's and Buffalo Wild Wings. Good luck, folks."}
{"text":"Omg where do I start?! First of all there was plenty of parking. That's always a plus for me! It was not crowded at all when I went so my son and I sat in a nice big booth. I ordered the chicken tender basket and I ordered my son the kids version. The tenders were great! They came with fries, slaw and a biscuit. The biscuit was moist and the slaw was pretty flavorful. I'm actually not that big on fries even though most meals at places come with fries. They were perfectly fine. I really liked the Hubee sauce! It reminded me of a honey mustard but with a kick. My absolute favorite tho was he fried banana pudding! Yes that's right Fried Banana Pudding! I've never had that before nor did I know that it existed. They recommend to try it about 15 minuets after you get your meal so that it will be nice and warm when you eat it but I opted to get it with the rest of my meal because I was feening and I wanted to take a picture of the whole meal together! It's what foodies do okay! Yes I'm that annoying person that takes a pic of the food before she eats it. The service was great! The food was great and I left happy and full. I even made a little foodie Vlog about it on YouTube! ( Shameless Plug alert) Anyway great place and can't wait to go back https://youtu.be/2oySTtHyFe4"}
{"text":"Upon walking into Hubee D's, I was impressed with the atmosphere. It carries a southern charm and locally grown theme that is complemented by a modern menu display. Ingredients in plain view, a nice dining room, and other touches make this place much classier than its price point.   I ordered a large chicken tender basket. The breading on the chicken was fried to the perfect crisp, and the tenders themselves were country thick. Paired with their signature (BBQ-Ranchish?) sauce, this chicken is worth building a restaurant empire around. Fries, cornbread, and coleslaw also come with the basket. Fries were hand-cut and pretty tasty, but i prefer mine a little crispier. Cornbread tasted homemade and fresh. The slaw was awesome - a very conservative amount of ranch-vinaigrette-like dressing makes it seem like a cole slaw salad as opposed to the frequent overly mayonnaised slaws. Overall, the basket greatly exceeded my expectations. Next time i'll be trying the fried banana pudding."}
{"text":"Hubee D's caught my eye as I was looking for a quick lunch. I am not a fan of typical fast food but in full disclosure I just had my eyebrows done and looked a little weird (i.e bright red skin around my eyes) so I was trying to avoid spending any time in an eating establishment.   There wasn't much of a line at noon on a Thursday, so I ordered the three piece fingers and fries to-go. At just under $7 it wasn't any more expensive than your typical fast-food spot in my opinion. I concur with other reviewers that everyone I encountered was very friendly.   I asked if they had any sauces and they directed me to try one of their many varieties (6 or 7) , I started pouring one in a to-go cup and the sauce must have dried up on the top of the squeeze bottle because it came out like a rocket...all over my face, hair, clothing...it was safe to say I was covered. Many staff members mentioned this happens all the time which had me thinking \"why hasn't management changed the bottle???\" I know they felt bad because they offered me a beverage and even a free dessert pop.. It was definitely nice that they cared, but it won't cover the cost of my stained dress.  Luckily I worked from home that day because a shower was very necessary, I could not have returned to work in that condition. I abandoned my sauce collecting efforts after that.   The food was definitely better than your typical fast-food.  It was very well seasoned, if a tad salty but I liked it. The fries were really good, probably my favorite thing. They were thin and crispy. I didn't find the food any more greasy than what's usual for fast-food. I'm still more of a Zaxby's  fan when it comes to fingers but I would return to Hubee D's if I didn't feel like venturing too far from home."}
{"text":"For what it is and the price , out of the Low Country Charleston we have a wing place with low country inspired sauces.  Everything has been delicious and well put together !! Love it"}
{"text":"We finished the meal...so it wasn't bad. It just wasn't good. The sauces are very \"preservative\" like. The portions aren't very big. We left hungry. But we spent $30 on 2 adults and a child.  I'd honestly say just go somewhere else if you're looking for wings. This is a cute place but we left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for a fast food restaurant. The food is ALWAYS fresh and the management is very supportive of our community. I personally recommend the the chicken nugget basket. The cornbread is awesome, too."}
{"text":"Visited Hubee D's for the first time yesterday.  I got the tenders basket.  The tenders were really good, had taste and weren't over cooked.    The fries are shoestring fries and to my taste were over cooked.  Cornbread had a sweet taste to it, kind of a desert in itself.    Definitely a return trip."}
{"text":"Love, love, love it!!!!!! I absolutely love Hubbee D's. I go there every chance I get. I always get their chicken tenders and put even single sauce. But my favorite one is hubbee sauce!! It's so perfectly spiced l, I crave it. They're fries are soo good. Even though they are not crispy they are perfectly spiced. I love it. There's never any left overs!"}
{"text":"Their fries are amazing and the other food is great as well! Their salads only come with one dressing and you have to pay for extra is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Extremely good food! I got a goat island salad and it was huge!! The price was great. The salad was delicious, this was my first time here and I was very happy. I came for lunch and got served right away with no wait. Very friendly service! Will go back."}
{"text":"We had the Hubee D's food truck at our work today. I ordered the chicken tenders and they were hands down the best chicken tenders I have ever had! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were just looking for a quick bite to eat when we passed by Hubee Ds. We tried the chicken tenders and the dry rubbed wings. Both of us liked our meals very much. It is a great restaurant for chicken on a budget and fast food. I liked the tenders better than Zaxby's for sure. They also have crushed ice and fix your own fountain drink.   I recommed this fast food restaurant to anyone looking for a chicken meal. The staff was very nice and helpful, and the place was clean and quiet."}
{"text":"The dry rub wings are great. They taste just like a well seasoned rotisserie chicken. We also tried the tenders dipped in hot wing sauce & they were great.   The atmosphere was very friendly. There is a covered patio area as well as an outdoor seating area.   The kids love the banana pudding pops that come free with their meal. And my wife & I enjoyed the fried banana pudding. Wow. That's a new one but it was really good  The wait staff didn't miss a beat. They were very attentive & punctual. 5 Stars for the service."}
{"text":"Fries are awesome. Chicken has great flavor, just wish it had some crisp to. Tenders were a little soggy. Crushed ice for drinks though!"}
{"text":"You can't get smoked wings just anywhere. The rub was great. Less is more when it comes to how these are prepared. The price is a bit steep, but worth it."}
{"text":"This is a good place for tenders. Also, Their salads are pretty great too. Very friendly staff. Reasonably priced. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"There are few places that I wake up in the morning thinking about but this is one of them. My staff introduced me to this place and I can honestly say that I had it three times in a six days. The food is always hot and fresh. The sauces complement the chicken not over power it. The portions are good. Just make sure that you get some to take home for snacking."}
{"text":"Chicken tenders attract teenagers! This spot was filled with them tonight.   The first battle you'll have to fight is finding a parking space. We initially tried the front of the restaurant but had no luck. FYI there are a few tight parking spots behind the restaurant. Spots can be tricky for larger SUVs.  The menu is pretty basic: tenders, wings, salads and wraps. You can have your items tossed in a sauce...but that will cost you. Ask for ranch? That will cost you, too! Your best bet is to use the community complimentary sauces near the drinks. Not a fan of community condiments, I took a chance on the bourbon dipping sauce. It was rather tasty with a nice kick.   I selected the three tender basket. Sides are cornbread, fries and coleslaw. Food arrived quickly but our waitress had her iPhone tattooed to her ear and didn't bring the ranch dressing that we had indeed paid extra for at the register. The three tender basket is more like a kid's meal. The tenders are tiny, although seasoned well and arrived hot. I can't say the same for the fries. Mine were lukewarm, at best. The coleslaw was rather bland and I stopped after one forkful. But, the cornbread morsel was rather tasty. That could have been much larger.   Cleanliness was a factor. I wanted to sweep the floor and rid it of fries. My husband noticed that the booth behind me didn't get wiped between patrons.  One and done..."}
{"text":"What a great surprise! I have had Hubee D's on my \"to try\" list for months, but am not a huge fast food/fried food eater so kept avoiding. So needless to say I was so wrong in what I thought I was getting myself into. The food was fresh, didn't give me a fast food feeling and had amazing service! Upon arriving I explained to the guy at the counter I had never been, but wasn't a fried fan. He recommended the grilled chicken sandwich. So, I chose the grilled chicken sandwich basket, which included fries, slaw, and a piece of cornbread. I received a number and found a table, which was rough b/c the place was packed. After only a few minutes I was delivered my meal. The sandwich was served on a kaiser roll with the Hubee sauce and pickles, which was fresh and hot, but I think needs some lettuce or something. The fries, OMG! Thin, crispy and served with the perfect amount of salt. I also enjoyed the slaw, but did find the cornbread to be a little sweet and dry for my tasting.  Overall, I loved Hubee D's and look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"On the better side of \"good\" for what they are. Very friendly staff and food was fine. At the end of the day, this is a fast food place with some flare. Small, simple and cheap, with a small, simple menu based around chicken wings, tenders and some related salads and wraps. Apparently the desserts are special. As I saw several folks come in and get just that. Sauces are fine. Fries were good. All in all, for a quick, comfortable lunch on the run, this is your place - if you're in the area - not worth driving across town for."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The chicken is always yummy, and I love the fries and atmosphere of the Providence Rd. Location.  Today I tried the catering for a tv crew.  It was a very easy process with  friendly staff to deal with.  Delivery was right on time and reasonably priced.  I got grilled tenders and crispy nuggets with salad and cornbread.  The crew loved it!  There were no leftovers!   Thanks so much HubeeD's!"}
{"text":"This is pretty tasty chicken!  They have a nice selection of wings, tenders and chicken sandwiches.  The tenders are moist, much better than a fast food tender, and definitely does not taste frozen!  The wings are pretty good - not nearly as good as DD Peckers, or the grilled wings at CharBar - but far better than a Buffalo Wild Wings!  Their sauces are decent - nothing that is worth murdering someone to get the recipe for, but they add a good kick and plenty of flavor.    The French fries are the little shoestring fries, crisp, but still moist.  Easy to dip a bunch at once and stuff your face with!    It's a good place to stop and grab a box of tenders and fries to go for lunch/dinner on the run.  My wife and I do this when we drive to/from uptown and don't have time to stop and sit down for dinner - but don't want fast food!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm addicted. Dry rub wings are so good and the service is excellent every time I've come in here for lunch."}
{"text":"I somehow always crave chicken on Sunday's, so Hubee D's was a destination of choice.  I was slightly surprised to find out that it wasn't a traditional sit down restaurant, (i.e. You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you at a table.) but no big deal. I ordered the grilled chicken tenders, cole slaw, and some cornbread.    The items I ordered were all good, but one thing I loved is the amount of dipping sauces provided at the table.  Their signature sauce is really good (sweet, creamy, spicy) and the other sauces were fun to try, too.    Surprisingly, for a restaurant that isn't a traditional sit down place, the service was exceptional....the person who took our order, also delivered our food, cleared plates/dishes as needed, checked on us, and even refilled our drinks for us (filled them so high he had to walk a tightrope back to our table from across the restaurant. Well done!)...all while still running shop at the front of the house, too.  (He was tipped well.)  This is a nice 'tweener' restaurant.  Almost like a chicken-centric version of Panera."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Chop Salad with Crispy Chicken on top.  I used bbq sauce and blue cheese as dressing.  YUMMY!  Cornbread on the side was very good as well. $8.00  Staff very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I had the Cobb crispy chicken wrap. It was my first time here. The cashier was prompt and the overall service was pleasant. The wrap and fries were good. I tried the Hubee D's sauce. I am unfortunately not a fan of the house sauce, but the Sweet Bbq sauce was good. Will return with my husband to try some salads."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars here as my experiences here have been all good.  The staff are really nice and they make sure your food (made to order) is hot and fresh.  I usually get the tenders here, but their wings look mighty good.  The combo meal comes with fries, slaw, and cornbread.  All of them are pretty on point... cornbread being on the sweet side, but definitely not lacking in buttery goodness.  Small parking lot up front, but there are spaces in the back.  Heaven forbid people follow the \"one way\" direction when exiting out onto Providence (probably my biggest gripe about the Manor/Panera parking lot.  There is street parking on Middleton Drive as well, but if you can't find a space, that's probably a good indication that this place is packed.  I've not experienced the rush here, but I can imagine it can get quite hectic.  Sauces... lots of sauces to choose from on the table.  Personally I don't have a \"go-to\" sauce here but all of them are decent depending on what you are eating that day.  I wouldn't call this place fast food, but more along the fast casual side of restaurants.  There are TVs in the dining room so you can come to watch a couple games and enjoy some beverages with the food as well.  Bus your own table here, but there is often a staffer that will clear your trash/empty dishes from the table."}
