{"text":"I have been a customer here since 1998, when I started grad studies at McGill. Simply, this is one of the greatest Chinese restaurants I have tried anywhere in the world (including Beijing). It's a family run business; the food is prepared and served delicately. No MSG. No taste of rotten veggies or reheated chicken to be expected here. Yet it is so cheap (11-14$). My favourite dishes are Shanghai noodles, ginger beef, general tau chicken, and sesame beef. But tasting from friends orders has never disappointed me either. We used to hold many post-defence parties here. Yes they do serve alcohol. Glad to come back to Montreal after a long globe trotting and finding them up and kicking."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the weekend stayed at the Downtown area. It was cold as @&$$ so some hot food was just what I needed. The dumplings and egg rolls were delicious, we were told they're homemade.  Spinach chicken was a wonderful dish with crispy spinach and the Szechuan beef was a perfect balance of spice.  Fried rice was very fragrant and not oily."}
{"text":"We came here on our last night in Montreal because it was near our hotel. Instead of traveling to Chinatown, we decided to stay local and give this place a try. 6:00 on a Saturday: nobody in the restaurant except for one person ordering takeout. And it stayed like this throughout the night, which was unfortunate since the restaurant looks quite appealing. While it was dimly lit, the restaurant was nice and cozy. The menu is not too expensive. They do a more Americanized Chinese food menu, so don't expect to find some of the Chinatown specialties here. We started off with their dim sum, which was pretty good. The shrimp inside was nicely cooked and the skin wasn't too thick. I got their Shanghai noodles, which were a bit greasy. The noodles were thick and perfectly cooked. Their duck was fantastic, though. They have a couple of duck dishes, but we got one that was fatty and so amazing. While the food was great, there was nobody in the restaurant to enjoy it as well, so make sure to stop by if in the area."}
{"text":"Good variety, however, it is not a typical Chinese restaurant in my opinion. The wonton soup was okay, and for my main course, I had a very good platter of chicken maple mustard with veggies.  The ambiance was very nice and a bit romantic. Everything in the menu wasn't really expensive, making it good value for money.  Not a must, but definitely a good restaurant. I'll go back without any doubt. ______________________________________________  Bonne variété, cependant, ce n'est pas un restaurant chinois typique selon mon opinion. La soupe wonton était bien et pour mon plat principal, j'ai eu un très bon plat de poulet à la moutarde d'érable ainsi qu'avec des légumes. L'ambiance était très agréable et même un peu romantique. Tout dans le menu n'était pas vraiment cher, ce qui en fait un bon rapport qualité prix.  Pas un incontournable, mais c'est certainement un bon restaurant. J'y retournerai sans aucun doute."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese takeout food, but a bit over priced"}
{"text":"The food quality in this place has gone downhill really fast..I just wasted 80 dollars in dinner for two and all I ate was flour, three shrimps and a Hsing Tao beer. We ordered Beef Szechuan which happened to be just big globs of fried dough drenched in sweet n sour sauce, no beef at all, just fried batter... a shrimp dish with six shrimps and a heap of fried noodles (more flour), plus some noodles with vegetables, and obviously more noodles than vegetables...so at the end I must have eaten a pound of flour for which I must have paid around 30 dollars....I love Chinese food, but I always feel ripped off when I go to a Chinese restaurant because what I pay for is not what I get (with very few exceptions)...next time Ill cook my own stuff, I can buy real beef, real chicken, frozen veggies and the spices already prepared at the supermarket (which is what they use at restaurants...I am talking about the spices) ... and it will take the same amount of time it took for my and my dinner companion to get the food on the table, but at least Ill know I am eating real food and not allowing anybody rip me off."}
