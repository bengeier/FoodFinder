{"text":"The food and cocktails are pretty amazing! The Aperol Spritz is the best that I ever had. The place is welcoming and pet friendly."}
{"text":"Probably the worst steak I ever had....way too overpriced, tough, with no flavor.  Service was moderate, although our waitress was very knowledgeable and sociable.  Ambiance was waaaaaaay too loud.  Couldn't hear each other at the table.  A bit dissapointing."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch to celebrate my wife's birthday. Atmosphere is great, service was attentive, beware of the food! Over seasoned and over greased. My mother got the pastrami sandwich, not much meat on it but enough grease to make all other pittsburgh sandwiches look healthy. I had the typical breakfast, eggs drowning in grease, homefries so over fried they were rocks. Wife had the mushroom gravey biscuits, which she liked while eating but Wife and I are still feeling the grease brick left in our stomachs after 24 hours. Expected better than a greasy spoon, got the greasiest spoon. As others have commented not many veggie/healthy options."}
{"text":"Went here the other evening.  Beautiful restaurant and very hip atmosphere.  I ordered a ribeye-which was perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  One of the best steaks I've had in a long while.  Don't skip out of the dessert!  Fantastic.  Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner at the Whitfield.  The whole place has an \"off the beaten path but cool and stylish\" vibe which set a great tone for the evening.  The menu hits the right balance between being inventive and accessible, and everything we ordered was fantastic.   The crowning star, though, was the staff.  They, too, have mastered that fine balance between being helpful and giving you space, being professional but also personable. Among our favorites were the appetizer butcher's plate, smoked Laurel Hill trout, walleye, dessert truffles, really, it was all wonderful!\""}
{"text":"This is one of those places that everyone just has to go to because of the myth created by skillful PR people.  And we stupidly fell for the hype.  Loud and crowded atmosphere, uncomfortable seating, bad service -- and those are the positive attributes.  Cocktails - watered down - tasted like they were made with Squirt or some other bargain soda from the 70s.  We shouldn't have been surprised when we had to order cocktails because they didn't have any recognized top shelf liquor or aperitifs.  Our waiter raved about the locally sourced steaks. Wow - $65 for my husband and I to share 32 ounces of gristle and fat that was falsely touted as ribeye steak.  Maybe Sasquatch ribeye.  But wait - and wait we did - for two hours after ordering our entree.  We must have had 5 different rather flustered wait staff stop by our table at various times during the two hour waiting period to apologize for the back up in the kitchen and to prolong the anticipation by telling us our dinner would be right out.  It wasn't.  It must take an awful long time to brown gristle and fat.  Too bad it didn't improve the taste.  Those ugly and hard wooden chairs salvaged from Olde Country Buffet didn't get any more comfortable after two hours either.  And the noise level bouncing off the dirty marble floors didn't help -- our throats were sore after screaming across the table to hear each other talk above the din and ambient throbbing sounds of 1995.  Chalk one up for the advertising industry -- there went 4 hours and $145 we will never get back."}
{"text":"We only had bar snacks and drinks here. I am rating the drinks only, I don't think I had a good sample size of food to rate. Drinks were amazing. My wife had the French 120, gin lemon grapefruit-tarragon and sparkling wine, I had the East Liberty and Gimlet. Bon Appetit rated the pastrami sandwich #2 in America."}
{"text":"Really freaking good.  Meat plate was awesome, as was the duck.  Lamb carpaccio could have used a little bigger portion, same with the braised rabbit entree.  However, flavors were awesome in all dishes. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pleasant, service was adequate, food was good. I had a steak which was good but the   potatoes were nothing special (they looked and tasted like they came out of a bag). Maybe a small portion of good bread would have been a nice touch. The cappuccino hazelnut chocolate cake was good. Not sure that I will return for dinner, but maybe to have a drink."}
{"text":"Went for dinner - good food and ambiance! I would recommend sitting in back if you are looking for conversation as, the front gets pretty loud at nighttime. Bar area looked pretty cool but we didn't stay."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner and found the food to be really delicious! Had a great glass of wine as well. The service was really great as well. Would recommend you give this a try!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience -- we celebrated a birthday brunch and were thoroughly pleased. The atmosphere was appealing and the food was delicious. However, the staff made this review 5-star -- thank you Dillon -- best service in town!"}
{"text":"It's appropriate that a beautiful chocolate cake is the lead photo for this restaurant. It is what brought me here, and I wasn't disappointed. My variation was a mint chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and Fernet Branca--whatever that is. A woman at a neighboring table noticed that I got mine at the same time as she did. She turned around to ask what I thought. I said it was amazing. She said she wanted to scream. Oh, I also had dinner. On a German kick of late, I had the duck breast with cabbage and sp√§tzle. It was also great. I would have preferred the duck be more fully cooked and/or I be given a sharper knife, but the flavor was good so he persisted."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night.  Three observations:

1.  Every dish we had was, without exception, perfectly executed.  From the opening cocktail through salads, steak, sides, and dessert, each item was a great example of good ingredients cooked well and served promptly.  I especially enjoyed grilled ramps (nice touch in early spring), but everything was great.

2.  On the surface, it wasn't my kind of place:  I wouldn't have designed the restaurant area the way that it was designed (open, with lots of hard surfaces reflecting noise); I wouldn't have chosen to hang out with the crowd that this place attracts (kudos to the guy in the skin tight tux and the woman's hairdo, and to the woman in ironically-worn 1950s-style dress with combat boots, but I find that making kind of effort to be exhausting); and I wouldn't normally pay what they charged me (almost $200 for an admittedly boozy dinner for two).  For all these reasons, I may not go back soon or ever.  But the design and the food reflect a great deal of time and attention to detail; and the crowd and the prices reflect that.  I respect the effort and appreciate it.

3.  Crazy to think that I used to walk through here at night 15 years ago and felt like I was risking my life to do it.  East Liberty has changed a ton, and while part of me misses the old Pittsburgh that I grew up in, the change is for the better."}
{"text":"I've had lunch at the restaurant, and drinks a few times in the bar, and I have had overall good experiences. A few times the bar has been crowded, but that's not their fault. A few times the (younger) servers have seemed a bit taken with themselves and their surroundings, but not quite pretentious. But, the draft list is considered, short, and 100% local, so that get's my vote. You can order a boulevardier, and no one blinks. Drinks are reasonably priced, and usually in pleasantly chunky, weighty glasses. So, comforting.

I was not able to be home for Christmas this year, and I ended up at the bar for what turned out to be a really warm, welcoming Orphan's Christmas. There was a drag queen lounge singer, and a small band. It took a while to get a drink, but eh- it was busy. These things happen. The point? Everyone was in a great mood and that comes from the staff. If they were upset, grouchy, short with customers, it would rub off. Nope. Instead, super gracious, warm, welcoming, and seemed genuinely happy to be a part of what was happening. 

I've worked in hotels. They are open every day of the year. Sometimes, you have to work instead of being with your family. Cheers to the management for creating an atmosphere where it was very clear that the employees were happy to be there, and create that welcoming space. The rest is just details.

(Oy gevalt, those bar stools are uncomfortable, though.)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, but gets busy after 10:00 a.m.  Very attractive interior and interesting building."}
{"text":"I've had several meals here since they opened, both brunch and dinner. Recently had brunch here and it was really good. First, I have to admit that I love the space. Retro-ish, cool and trendy without being obnoxious about it.Very comfortable. And I love that they kept so much of the interior in tact. The huge windows are wonderful. Service is usually good, but can be a bit unenthusiastic depending on the server. Food is very well prepared and creative without being pretentious. Cocktails are also a highlight and they always have something interesting to try. Always enjoy going here ad looking forward to going back. An excellent addition the the East End."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for any meal of the day! Also a great place for drinks. My favorite is the open gym in the back where you can enjoy a nice cocktail and play games (there is a basketball hoop, ping pong tables). There is also a photo booth! The best part - it's dog friendly!! 

In terms of food, I really enjoy the breakfast / brunch. I highly recommend the mushroom gravy and biscuits!! It's a refreshing twist on biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"In a word: meh. The best part of this place is the interior. Lots of the original architecture (woodwork and floors, for example) is beautifully preserved. The staff was nice and attentive, though they don't come off as very experienced. 
I was there with a fairly large group for brunch on a weekday. The restaurant wasn't terribly full, but it took a ridiculously long time for our food to arrive. I got the Whitfield breakfast. One egg was poached properly (soft, runny yolk) the other yolk was completely set. The chimichurri was stingy, the hollandaise tasted like vinegar, and the hash brown was dry. A few people got the buttermilk fried chicken salad, which looked like an overdressed mess that you'd get at any Pittsburgh diner (complete with french fries, natch). 
I really want to like this place, so I'll give it another shot (probably for dinner this time) but things aren't looking too good."}
{"text":"I had been anxiously waiting to go to Whitfield since we decided to move to Pittsburgh from DC in February. We went last night and had the most mediocre experience. Our server could not have been nicer and attentive, but that was literally the only positive part. 

We were seated at a four-top right in front of the main doors and on a Saturday night, you would've thought we went to eat in a beer hall it was so loud you could not hear the person immediately next to you. Acoustics need to be improved to actually institute an enjoyable experience.

The food: Ordered the focaccia and lard - bread was fine but so oversalted and lost the taste of the bread. Cesar was watery, and the entrees were the worst part. I ordered The Steak cooked medium, and it came out well done looking like an airlines portion of steak cooked in a microwave. Not a lick of flavor or juices came out of it and being pre-cut, made it look even worse. Presentation was horrible as it was just stuffed on a plate with fries and no garnishes. 

The other people I dined with ordered the braised rabbit and trout. Braised rabbit with gnocchi came out in a long serving platter that was meant to hold a tenderloin and drowned in sauce. It tasted more like a chicken noodle soup than at $20+ rabbit with gnocchi. Additionally, presentation again was the issue here and made the food look unappetizing. Lastly, the trout was probably the only part of the meal that was good, as it had flavor and was a decent size, but nothing you couldn't pick up at Whole Foods and cook yourself, with a scoop of lima beans on the side.

To top off the night of extremely disappointing food and atmosphere, we were told at the end that their entire internet/credit card system was down and would have to write our payment information on a piece of paper for them to charge us at a later date and email to ask how much we'd like to tip. Not only was this unprofessionally handled, but when asked to speak with the manager, they did not have any appropriate response to ensure your information would be secure and the issue would be resolved. 


Disappointing to say the least, especially when going in with high hopes. Good thing Millies Homemade Ice Cream is down the street and turned the night around. Best part of Shadyside!

ps. get some new plates! They make or break the food presentation and would help not make the food look so blah and bare."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast today and just had an average experience. I had the three egg omelet with the 7-grain toast. It was just okay but the veggies and cheese on the inside kept sliding off as I was trying  to eat it. The mixed greens with it and the toast were pretty mediocre and nothing special. The service was rather slow and intermittent. I really loved the atmosphere though and the vibes are very trendy. The overall aesthetic was fantastic and I would be willing to try it again maybe for another meal or to try something else on the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Review is only for the bar and overall Ace Hotel lobby/Whitfield ambiance.  Cocktails were excellent and beer selection was top-notch.  Bartender was knowledgeable and personable.  Music consisted of a DJ who spun decent mixes.  Crowd was a bit too cool to actually have any fun, until they had enough alcohol in them to be social.  But that's what you get with a 'hipster' scene.  The cheap-looking white trellis separating the dining area from the rest of the bar/lobby has to be one of the most out of place design elements I've ever seen in a higher end establishment -- just plain ugly and weird."}
{"text":"Wife, daughter, son-in-law, and I went this past Saturday the 19th. I really like the building, it has serious charm. $200 later I thought about this review and wanted to be fair.

That said, this is a large building and I am sure it was quite an investment by whomever! There is still space inside where they have the gameroom in the back. I don't think its being utilized well as the area could be. I know the place is new, but I would recommend moving away from the games and do something classier. Frankly, the people who go someplace like that for games are probably not going to be the same people who order the $65 ribeye for two.

Finally, the ribeye was decently flavoful, but there was just not enough on the plate to rate high marks. I know it was organic and grass fed, but $65, I don't think so!

{"text":"Service was exceptionally pleasant and quick. And the food was bordering obscene. The bruleed grapefruit was amazing, carrot bread was delicious and not too sweet, the roast beef sandwich was the size of a human head. I would come back for brunch every weekend if we still lived in Pittsburgh. Just visiting. Kudos my friends!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there recently to celebrate a friends birthday. I ordered the fried chicken salad which was terrific, and much more than I could finish. Had the fried apple pie for desert. Incredible!"}
{"text":"When I walked into this place I loved the atmosphere and environment but when we sat down we didn't have much time to choose from the menu because they were closing the kitchen in ten mins. The menu was interesting but the options were limited. We were rushed so I decided to go with the mac-n-cheese and my boyfriend got a salad, but when I ordered they put bacon on it the Mac-n-cheese when I asked twice for it to be without, and when I tried it...I'm sorry but it tasted as if It were a Kraft macaroni and cheese bought from the grocery store. Personally I've made much better homemade Mac-n-cheese myself. Then my boyfriend's salad was almost comparable to a side salad at Wendy's, not much in it and very small and unappealing. For the price of it, it was not worth it. When I ordered a glass of wine that was 14 dollars I figured it would be an actual \"glass of wine\" not a sample at a wine tasting place. The glass was literally not even half full. I would love this place of they changed the prices and some of the menu options around for something more appealing to customers. Very expensive and very small servings. I would go back if the service was better along with price changes and a menu change."}
{"text":"The ambience was pleasant with just the right level of music to counteract the people talking. The price was ok (by California standards, not sure about Pitt prices) if you didn't go overboard with order. The food itself was both very good and ok. 

First the good: the three egg omelette with smoked pepper was the 'best omelette ever' according to my mother with nicely flavored filling and perfectly cooked eggs. The soy latte, while small was very good. The blueberry pancake (without the creme  fraiche due to dietary restriction) was excellent with maple syrup, very fluffy and with fresh blueberries. 

Now the bad; the pastrami sandwich (without cheese for dietary reasons) was not up to par with the other items. First it was served with French fries, this coupled with the well buttered and thick toast overpowered the flavor of both the pastrami and the Cole slaw. The Cole slaw wasn't acidic enough to shine through the other flavors and the pastrami was overly fatty (even for pastrami) and was not able to overcome the flavor of the bread and fries. The potato chips where good but unnecessary/too much with the fries."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting venue. My wife and I went for dinner on our anniversary, and had a great meal, and a great time. They had a vegetarian tasting menu option which worked out wonderfully for her, and I had a fantastic steak.

Cocktails were amazing, service was tremendous, and it was a very interesting vibe, to say the least. My only knock on the setup is that it's pretty loud, and it's a little dark in the evening. They also accept reservations through OpenTable, which is a big plus in my book.

All things considered, I'd still highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Amazing. Absolutely amazing. After reading a lot of raving reviews we stopped in for breakfast, and I'm so glad we did. We were greeted by Janae, who is the sweetest. When asking if we were ready to put in our order I explained I couldn't decide. She really took the time to help me hash it out. I ended up ordering the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancake, it was utterly amazing and so filling. There was no way I could eat the whole thing, ever. 

The blueberries were so fresh. The sweet lemon creme is bonkers. I loved that it was cooked in a cast iron skillet, the texture made it even better. When we go back I will be ordering it again, because it was that amazing. 

Definitely recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"I wanted to be writing about the food or the service or anything about the place but alas I don't know.  I'm writing to let folks know that if you're thinking about going here for Sunday brunch you will need a reservation apparently -- even when most tables in the place are empty.  We were just there and the very unhelpful hostess told us that despite all the empty tables and the somewhat early hour for brunch (10am) she couldn't seat us.  Oh well, plenty of great brunch places nearby!"}
{"text":"Passed Pittsburgh on a road trip and stayed at the Ace hotel. Was almost going to skip out on dining at the Whitfield but I'm so glad I didn't. This place is da bomb. They serve brunch everyday (not just on the weekends) and I loved everything we ordered. Whitfield breakfast (fantastic eggs Benedict with beet hash brown), duck confit (paired with a cinnamon fruit tea per recommendation), br√ªl√©e grapefruit, and carrot bread. Every item was done extremely well (simple sounding names but tastes awesome), better than anything I had in Manhattan. Service was on point, our waiter Daniel was so accommodating and explained every item to us, making the perfect recommendations. If you're staying at the Ace or are just nearby, definitely stop by :)"}
{"text":"I've been on a brunch binge recently, and this place has been on my list for a while. I finally made it over today to check it out. Briefly, it's situated in the lobby of the Ace Hotel, which is in an old YMCA building. I thought the decor was pleasing, and enjoyed the artwork on the wall, though personally I felt like it was missing something, but I can't put my finger on it. I'm not sure the mcm design aesthetic meshed with the original flooring. But that's a minor point. 

We ordered two items off the specials menu: donuts with a cherry jam and lemon(?) cream, and a plate that had pancakes, pork belly, and eggs; and one item off of the regular menu: the Whitfield, which is essentially an eggs benedict. 

The donuts were AMAZING. We ate them so fast I didn't get a photo. My only complaint is that there were only 3! They were light and airy and fresh and warm and melted in your mouth. Omnomnom. 

My partner got the special with the pork belly and pancakes, and I tasted some of it. The pork belly was good, but it's hard to go wrong with pork belly. The pancakes, though, were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I don't even like pancakes much, because there are too many dry boring pancakes in the world. This was fluffy and ever so slightly chewy and tasted a bit like lemons and powdered sugar. I'm not sure what they did, but it was magic. I can't praise the pancakes enough. 

The Whitfield was okay. The eggs benedict portion was not bad but not great. It did come with a beet and potato little croquet/latke that I enjoyed a lot. It tasted a lot like it latke, instead of, say, hashbrowns. It  was kind of sticky like a latke. I couldn't overtly taste the beets, but perhaps it added something that enhanced the flavor. 

Oh. And I thought  the coffee was quite good too. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place early this morning for breakfast before heading out to Ohiopyle after reading about it on Thrillist best new brunch spots.  The food was awesome! And the staff even better.  Greeting us with a welcoming good morning, we were promptly seated and tended to.  The breakfast menu is a bit lighter than the brunch but was perfect in preparation for our hike.  I got the three egg omelette, cooked to perfection with beautifully cooked peppers, onions and melted cheese.  My friend ordered the toad in a hole and commented on the distinct taste of the pepper jelly.  Overall great experience, would love to come back here at night for dinner fare!"}
{"text":"I just ate here for the third time, and I can't even express how psyched I am that the Whitfield serves breakfast everyday. The first two meals were dinners, both excellent. The third was a delicious caramelized onion and pepper omelette and a latte, made by a well-trained professional barista. 

I understand the sentiment behind the bumper sticker, \"Keep Pittsburgh Shitty\" -- I'm not wild about the googlization of the 'burgh (despite the fact that here I sit yelping on my macbook). However, I can't get behind all the truly shitty breakfast places in the city anymore. It's time for some better breakfast options, especially to keep pace with all the fantastic dinner restaurants we have now (like Whitfield!).

Not only is the food and coffee fantastic at Whitfield, but the restaurant and Ace Hotel lobby bar area are also excellent spaces for working (the general manager told me they encourage it!). There's free wifi, and there's a public parking lot right behind the library next to the Ace Hotel.  

Whitfield! XOXO"}
{"text":"The Whitfield has a simplistic elegance! I appreciate the exquisite customer service and clean and delicious food! Michael, the Restaurant manager from the first time I stood at the front entrance had me feel welcome like an old friend! I will continue to return and refer folks to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we did not have a meal this evening at the Whitfield that we felt represented the money we spent. We decided to go here for our 20th wedding anniversary. I started with the Fourth River Mule, which was refreshing and quite good. My husband really enjoyed his pear flavored cider. For appetizers, I had the shrimp cocktail and my husband had the French onion soup. My shrimp was fresh and had a nice size and good flavor. My husband said his soup was okay, but unremarkable. For entrees, we ordered the 38 oz Porterhouse for two, but we found it both fatty and, more unfortunately, gristly. I wish it had been more successfully butchered. We ordered it medium rare, and they did a very good job in that respect. The flavor was good, but I came specifically to this restaurant because they make a point of the fact they use grass fed and \"grass finished\" beef. The flavor did not shine through in this area. I have tasted grass-fed beef that was wonderful and some which was not particularly remarkable. This beef was of the latter distinction. The tallow poached fingerlings were just that, poached, and not soft or fluffy on the inside. When I asked if they could be cooked more, I received them back after a dip in the deep fryer, which did not improve the situation.  The mac and cheese with bacon bread crumbles was not particularly flavorful. I find Dive Bar's mac and cheese much more flavorful. The desserts were where I believe the Whitfield excelled. I ordered an affogato, which is Vanilla ice cream with Stumptown Espresso and the lemon mousse with shortbread and toasted meringue. We ordered pumpkin truffles for home and my husband ordered the olive oil mint chocolate cake with cashew butter, beer caramel and buttermilk cream. The chocolate cake was delightfully light and not heavy. We enjoyed the desserts, but felt the steak wasn't worth $80. For my tastes, Wagyu Flat Iron at Meat and Potatoes is much more worth the money. The Whitfield did have a hip vibe, good mixed drinks and friendly staff. It does have a few steps to get inside, for those who have difficulty walking, as I do. It seems like a great place to go for a drink, have dessert or to meet friends. Unfortunately, the food was a letdown. It was worth a try, but probably won't be on our list for another visit."}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! I went here for brunch with some friends on a Saturday. It has a ton of old world charm. It almost felt like I was sitting in the scene of the Titanic where Rose and Cal have breakfast and Cal flips the table (prior to the tabling flipping of course). The decor and architecture highlights the building's age while the brightness, use of plants, and creative food keeps it feeling fresh. Our service was polite with just the right amount of attention.

I oder the bruleed grapefruit and zucchini bread. The friends ordered an omelette, pancakes, and some spiced donut holes. The presentation on everything is so pretty! The donut holes even had an edible flower on the plate. The omelette looked very fluffy - but the pancakes turned out to be one super fluffy plate size pancake. We had never seen anything like it. She let me taste a bite; it was delicious and now I want to learn to make one like that at home. The best item was the zucchini bread. Like something your mom would make but you can never really replicate."}
{"text":"As a brunch fanatic, this place has a spot in my top 5 brunch spots in Pittsburgh.

Warning: make a reservation to be seated in the cafe area during the weekends because it gets super busy and you'd only be able to be seated near the bar section (if that area isn't packed already). Also, try to come on a sunny day as there are lots of big windows for natural lighting to shine through that really brings this cafe alive.

Sunday Brunch:

-Two Eggs Any Style-
I ordered two eggs over medium, toast, bacon, and home fries. It's a simple dish but oh so delicious! Dishes like these can come out too salty because of the bacon and home fries, but Whitfield brings out a perfectly balanced breakfast that was satisfying to my palate. 

-Whitfield Breakfast-
Must get. It's beautifully plated with a pop of color from the chimichurri spread on top of the poached eggs. Another balanced dish on the menu.

-Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich-
A classic but fried to perfection. Wasn't too greasy and the sauce inside really hit the spot. 

Came for a second visit after seeing the popular -Olive Oil Chocolate Cake- on Instagram. I've got a sweet tooth for things like chocolate cake so my friend and I came for a spontaneous visit for this dessert. First off, it is so aesthetically pleasing. The dark color of the chocolate cake paired with the pop of pink, orange, and blood orange colors = . This cake is light and spongey, not too thick. It's topped off with a crispy cookie that brings a surprise in texture. The sour straws and blood oranges give a bit of tanginess, creating a good balance to the sweet chocolate cake.

Overall, this cake is bomb. And I've had it twice already"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this hidden gem in East Liberty at The Ace Hotel. My friend invited me to brunch here, and I'm excited to return. We originally had a reservation for noon but found two available seats at the bar. As a person who stands at 5'1\", the bar stools were uncomfortable as I had to decide if I was going to sit fully on the chair and be far away from my food or sit on the edge to be closer. I could've been just super hungry and felt the need to hover over my food. 

Our waiter/bartender was awesome! He had such a fun, humorous personality. He was quick about requests and answered questions with the perfect amount of information.

I ordered scrambled eggs with whole wheat toast. I don't know what flavor the jam was but it was so fresh and delicious. The mimosa was fantastic and very crisp. 

What I loved most about this place was the atmosphere. There are multiple types of seating---bar, dining table, work table, and couches! Seated at each of those places were peoples of multiple ages. I love places where a variety of people feel comfortable."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how this restaurant gets such high reviews.  I've now eaten there three disappointing times.  Last Sunday, my son made reservations for brunch.  I had scrambled eggs with potatoes, bacon and wheat toast plus a side of grilled escarole.  The fingerling potatoes were so overly seasoned with a seasoned salt that they were barely edible.  One of two slices of bacon was burned.  The wheat toast was barely buttered and no butter or preserves were offered.  My son's over easy eggs were barely over easy with watery whites.  He too ordered grilled escarole and our portions were tiny, dry, unseasoned; uninspired, uninteresting.  Just a small group of leaves that were charred at the leaf tips.  My husband had the Whitfield and thoroughly enjoyed the poached eggs on English muffin with hollandaise.  But, it was accompanied by a black disk that was the beet and potato rosti."}
{"text":"This place was a little weird. The building itself is nice, but the tables and chairs looked cheap. It also felt like you were dining in a hallway with a dirty floor. The server was extremely nice, but the food took forever and it wasn't even busy! Overall, the food was good."}
{"text":"I had been hearing a lot recently about the Ace Hotel and Whitfield Restaurant and so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. In considering the entire experience, we must begin with parking. The Ace Hotel and Whitfield Restaurant are in East Liberty in an area with challenging-to-find street parking. The Ace Hotel offers valet parking and I would guess they would valet park for the Whitfield as well, but I dislike paying for valet parking, so we went with street parking. When we went inside the lobby and over to the entrance to the restaurant, we encountered an unenthused, lackluster hostess who got the experience off to a rather dreadful start. Our waiter was friendly enough but was incredibly inattentive and we could see him chatting with co-workers at the entrance to the kitchen when we were trying to get our check (and failing to catch his attention). As for the food itself, it was average at best. I had an omelet that was rather flavorless and my boyfriend had buttermilk pancakes that were a nice consistency but also quite flavorless. I wouldn't recommend the food and when we factor in the rather inflated prices given what we had ordered, I would certainly not recommend this place or the food (and forget about the service). I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch at Whitfield. Great flavors and some unique creations. Work a little trip out to the East Liberty area of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"With all of the buzz around the Ace Hotel opening, we couldn't wait to get in to try the Whitfield. The main lobby is separated with the Bar to the right and the restaurant to the left with only a flower cage dividing the two. It's a very open and welcome atmosphere. The service at the bar was great while we waited for our table. There was a nice craft cocktail selection and the prices were on par with other restaurants in Pittsburgh. 

As someone who previously worked in the industry, I know how important a knowledgeable and friendly wait staff is for a restaurant. Unfortunately, our server was so unfriendly, it really had a negative impact on our experience. He was uninterested in navigating the menu with us and when asked simple questions regarding dishes he was extremely annoyed. At one point, we asked his opinion on ordering the lamb or beef tartare as a starter and he informed us we had already ordered enough food and wouldn't suggest either option. Quite honestly, we were shocked a server wouldn't immediately jump at the chance to upsell a check. But, he dismissed us after we placed our order and didn't check back on us at all. 

Aside from the service we received, our meals were quite good. The strip steak and the duck breast were both delicious. The steak was prepared perfectly and very flavorful. The duck had a perfect sear on the outside and tender on the inside. As a side to our steak we chose the french fries and mushrooms and onions. I would certainly go for the brussel sprouts or another option next time as the fries were average, almost like frozen french fries and there were only onions served in our side with minimal mushrooms. The olive oil cake we enjoyed for desert was a highlight of the meal. 

I'm more than aware there are always kinks to work out when a restaurant is fairly new, but with the much anticipated opening of Ace and Whitfield, I expected a bit more. I certainly will try again in a few months and hope we have a better experience. It's been wonderful to experience the improvement of the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and while this is a solid addition to that, I do hope they improve their service."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here last night around 8:30.  Unfortunately it did not meet even an average rating for service or food quality.  Our server had a bit of an attitude, it took 45 mins to get a beer we ordered, and the water glasses went empty for most of dinner. We ordered the duck, chicken, steak and braised rabbit as entrees. The duck was good, the steak and chicken were okay.  The braised rabbit could no have had more than two ounces of meat on the dish and it was extremely salty, steak was salty as well.  We also had three salads and lamb carpaccio, salads were good, but lamb carpaccio was on toast with I believe a hummus like spread.  Hummus was tasty but over powered the lamb.  It was a very cool atmosphere but don't expect great food."}
{"text":"I went here during opening week and was disappointed with the service and had cold steak... Service seemed slow and unorganized but I was chalking it up ironing out the opening week issues. I have a friend in town and we decided to go back. The atmosphere was very loud and again poor service. The food was fine. My table ordered 2 burgers and the roasted chicken. One of the burgers was cold and part of my chicken dish was cold as well. I get the concept of the restaurant but the execution leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"We arrived on time for our reservation and found no one to greet us. After a short time I asked the bartender what the deal was and he said the host/hostess was seating another party. Within 5 minutes of arrival we were seated in the middle of an open dining room. I had heard wonderful things about the cheeseburger and ordered it medium rare. After a slightly longer time than I had anticipated the burger arrived well done. The wait person was apologetic and got another one started asap; she offered me some coconut/pumpkin/curry soup that was delicious and the replacement burger arrived mid-bowl. It was correctly cooked and delicious, though somewhat bland compared to the grass-fed beef I buy at home. It was topped with fried onion rings similar to those in a greenbean cassarole, fries (mediocre) and lettuce and tomato on the side. While I was in the restroom, the check arrived, and, unexpectedly my friend paid it. They had comped the burger so I didn't feel too badly. I would definitely return because the food and desserts passing by looked wonderful."}
{"text":"My preference at Whit is to sit in the lounge when possible. Eggs benedict & bloody mary's are always worth it. Any pork dish (on a transitioning menu) ive had has been to die for!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and really enjoyed it. Food was very good, menu was interesting and diverse, and service was good. The server was also very helpful and patient with my \"non-foodie\" guest. Price point was fair. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Me and 20 other people dined here for our work Christmas party. The service and food was great! The wait staff was super friendly and accommodating for our large group. Everyone agreed that the dinner was phenomenal. We were given an array of desserts and the dessert chef came by our table to chat with us and see how we liked everything. So nice!! Everything was great. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"A solid nightlife spot in East Liberty, easily accessible from the surrounding neighborhoods. Quality cocktails at reasonable prices. Appetizers and entrees are shareable and adequate portion sizes. The atmosphere was the best part of the experience. Situated in a former YMCA building, the bones of building and architecture from a bye gone era give the Whitfield an edge over similar establishments in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for brunch and both times the drinks and food were top notch. Seriously one of the best bloodies I've ever had. The menu is fun and thankfully not overwhelming. The bar area is cute if you are dining solo...their coffee is delicious too. I love that the Ace Hotel which is where the Whitfield is located is dog-friendly too. My only knock for not receiving five stars is that some of the people that work there could stand to smile a bit and be a bit idk...friendlier. You work in hospitality so that should be expected. But hey everyone has their off days I suppose."}
{"text":"I like the cooking here! Not super crowded the night we were there which was also nice, no wait for our table. Nice staff. It's a bit of a cold, minimalist ambiance but I do love the building, didn't get a chance to see the rooms, the hotel is a beautiful old restored YMCA. The restaurant is in the lobby and feels a little stark and awkward as far as it's integration into the lobby. Only a weird white cage/shelf thingy to separate the restaurant and lobby, but the food was great. We shared a few salads - the caesar was particularly good. The beef tartare was excellent! Our mains were all good, I had the trout and tried the chicken. The trout was cooked perfectly, the chicken a little dry. The chef does a carrot gratin deal that is delicious. Sauteed radicchio amazing. Overall an excellent meal and I will certainly go back, hopefully when the weather warms up, so maybe it will warm up the environment a bit."}
{"text":"Walking into the Ace Hotel, you get the feeling that you are in a place with a lot of history, being that it's the old YMCA.  It's got a cool feel to it.  It's a very open space where the restaurant and the bar are on opposite sides of the lobby and the check in desk is right in the middle.  I really wanted to be impressed with the food but unfortunately it was a bit disappointing.

The ladies ordered French Onion Soup.  They said it was good but very salty.  This is what happens when the soup sits and the water dissolves from it.  It was likely made the day prior.  

We had the rabbit and gnocci dish.  That was very good.  Light, not gamey at all, and the beans gave it a nice texture.  

We also had the beet salad and that was good.

For our main course, we had the Pork Shank.  It looked great when it came out but it didn't taste as good as it looked.  The meat on a shank should fall off the bone.  This had been cooked at too high a temp because it was dry and chewy.  It also only had a little splash of sauce on it and wasn't seasoned so it was bland.  It needed more sauce.  This was the most disappointing thing about the meal.  

The couple we went with got the steak and it was very good.  

For sides we got mac and cheese (fabulous), cheesy carrots (very good), Crispy brussels (liked them), and the sauteed kale (good).  

We had a few of their cocktails as well.  The Bourbon drink is good but small and gone quickly.  My wife had the lime almond drink but it was very limey and drowned out any other flavor.  

Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could but for the prices they charge, I expected a little more out of the main dish and thought the drinks could have been a little bigger.  I'd go back again and am sure that I will but the next time I will most likely get a steak as it seems to be more their specialty."}
{"text":"Consistently one of the most disappointing high-end restaurants in town. I have eaten here three times - twice for dinner and once for brunch - spread out fairly evenly over the time period that it has been open. I was truly horrified by the entrees my friend and I received for dinner on my first visit. They were the color and consistency of dog food, and woefully underseasoned. However, our butcher's plate was a bit above average, and dessert (the chocolate olive oil cake with orange creamsicle) was outstanding (and wisely still on the menu), so I revisited several months later for brunch. None of the brunch entrees excited me, so I went for the Cesar salad. The dressing was basically raw garlic sauce, totally overwhelming, and the uninspired additions (some crouton and a very small amount of anchovy) did nothing to save the dish. Shortly after this time, my parents visited the bar during happy hour. They are cheerful, urbanite barflies who enjoy visiting new, vibrant spots. The hostess proceeded to age-shame them into sitting at a table in the restaurant instead of going to bar, despite their repeated assurances that they were not worried that \"the bar will get crowded soon\" and that the \"tables are more comfortable.\" I revisited for the third (and I hope final) time this weekend for a birthday dinner at my friend's request. We were a party of three, and made a reservation a week in advance. We were awkwardly seated at a round 6-top, in a strange crescent-moon shape that made it very hard to have a conversation. I noticed a nearby long table, made of three 2-tops pushed together and set for a party of 5 (also awkwardly, at least for the lonely person at the end) and asked the hostess if she could put the 5-top at our round table and let us sit at two of the 2-tops. I was told that this was impossible. As someone who has hosted and bartended at popular, crowded restaurants for years, I do understand the minutia that goes into turning tables, so I let it go even though it seemed silly and frankly like a waste of space. We ordered some apps, sides and entrees. With the exception of the Brussels sprouts, which were fine, everything again was either underseasoned or unbalanced. The French onion dip was the consistency of watery hummus. The carrot gratin was underbaked and tasteless, with a really thin sauce that made the heavy carrot slabs slide around unappealingly. The mac and cheese was pale and uncheesy, and somehow overcooked despite looking like it didn't get any time in the oven. My rabbit rillettes were tasteless but covered in a jarringly bitter, acidic sauce, I believe of juniper berries. My friend's smoked chicken tasted strongly of artificial smoke flavor and was very one-note. The service was very attentive at first, but dropped off dramatically after we got our appetizers, despite the restaurant getting less and less crowded.  We spent verrrrrrry long periods of time with our cold dishes in front of us after all three of our courses, long after we'd stopped picking at the food. 
In short, don't waste time or money (soooo much money!) at Whitfield. There are too many restaurants in Pgh that are really nailing the food thing right now, without being thoughtless and haughty in the process. They know how to use salt and pepper, too."}
{"text":"So in Jan 2016 I wrote the review below ( scroll down).   So happy to say that we had dinner there earlier this week (early May) and it was fabulous. The menu had a lot of delicious spring vegetables. We had morels, ramps, and escarole. Each was delicious. I had a lamb carpaccio with a fava bean hummus-like spread. It was light, which is what I was hoping for.  Hubby was happy with the steak frites.

Super fun: they're carrying Zweigelt on the menu, which is rarely seen in Pittsburgh. I had the red (light and minimally frizzante), but there's a rose too. 

Waiter was great: informed, laid-back, friendly and unobtrusive.

We each had dessert, they were delicious. A beautiful panna cotta with a basil gel on top. Super pretty.

Super psyched to make Whitfield a regular stop.


Earlier review from Jan:
Sitting at Ace as I type. Ugh! Want this place to be south better. Both times I've been here they've been out of the wine I've ordered. In their defense, they apologized and gave me a glass for free. Which is lovely. I ordered a medium rare burger. It was delivered 25 minutes later (it's quiet here, it's 3pm on a Monday!) well done.  Such a bummer.

The staff was gracious at every turn."}
{"text":"I'm visiting my family and they wanted to come here as they'd read that the steaks had been written up and the pastry chef had won a James Beard Award. I'm so out of the loop that I didn't even know that the old YMCA had been converted into a hotel that is a little bit precious but also very cool (and secretly what I'd like my house to look like). The ambiance is beautiful in the restaurant--sort of your grandma's house meets Restoration Hardware, with lots of soft pastel greens and unfinished wood. Unlike some other reviewers, I'm fine with mismatched plates--given that this place is billing itself as an elevated version of standard Pittsburgh home food, it adds to the authenticity as I've never eaten off matching plates in my own home in my life.

I had a Fourth River Mule, which was a fairly standard mule, but it had plenty of lime which I appreciate! We started with the pierogies and the deviled/pickled eggs. The pierogies were AMAZING--Mrs. T's they ain't! They were light, not greasy, and the caramelized onions and creme fraiche were a wonderful touch. I only tried the deviled egg, which I'm not always a fan of, but these were spicy from horseradish and mustard and were sooo addictive. I could have had a whole plate of those.

I had the smoked chicken for my entree and...omg! Brussels sprout slaw, chicken, roasted cauliflower, and parmesan risotto (and a \"tomato butter\" which tasted more like a vinegar-based BBQ sauce) wouldn't naturally seem like they go together, but they were INCREDIBLE. I especially loved the Brussels sprout slaw, which had a sharp cheese mixed in and was so fresh. The chicken was nicely cooked and tender. My parents had the ribeye steak, which is meant for two and comes with two sides (they actually got three--crispy Brussels sprouts, carrots gratin, and fries). They really enjoyed it--I had a bite of the steak and found it delicious! They serve only grass-fed beef which is chewier and more flavorful than grain-fed beef. So it's \"tougher\" to chew, but way more delicious. The sleeper hit was the carrot gratin--sounds a little odd but it was SOOOOO good; cheesy with the sweetness of the carrot providing a different kind of feel from standard potatoes au gratin (and maybe healthier...or maybe not...). 

Dessert was the passionfruit bombe with brown butter cake, brittle, and candied hibiscus. You can really tell that James Beard award was deserved. The passionfruit mousse was light and nicely flavored, not too sweet, and was a perfect contrast to the buttery cake (the brittle was in the middle of the cake and was sugary and a nice addition). 

Service was friendly and attentive even when it got busy later on the evening. Just a perfect meal from beginning to end. I wish we had this in Seattle! As a Pittsburgh girl who grew up eating a lot of what's on the menu at home, I'd normally bristle at paying $10 for pierogies or deviled eggs, but they're so good I didn't really care. Not an everyday restaurant, but a wonderful place to elevate your palate just a little bit. Will definitely be coming back on future visits!"}
{"text":"The Whitfield is the restaurant in the Ace Hotel. The hotel and restaurant are both very hipster and cool, but overall feels comfortable. The lounge/bar area is a nice place to hang out. They typically have a good beer selection and also serve delicious Stumptown coffee.

My biggest gripe with the Whitfield? The lack of vegetarian/pescatarian options. They have two breakfast options, but last time I went, they had zero dinner options. They did have a few sides and apps, but I wasn't that impressed with the onion dip or the other non-memorable side dish. I feel like they might eventually have more vegetation friendly options, but for now it's a place I avoid for dinner. 

It can also be confusing when sitting in the bar area when trying to either more food/drinks, or get your check. Eventually someone will probably serve you, but I'm always a little preoccupied with worrying about going to the bar or waiting a little longer for a server to stop by.."}
{"text":"Only came in for a quick bite as I wasn't hungry, but because of fellow Yelpers wanted to give this place a try and I just happened to be close by.

This may be one of the most hipster of all hipster designed places I've ever been, and would easily be an attraction in any other large city with a hipster population.

Since I wasn't hungry, I just ordered a toad in the hole, and I've got to say I was so disappointed to see a single slice of toast when it arrived (even though I knew what I was ordering)... BUT it may have been the best single slice of Toast I've ever had.  The soft egg was able to hit the money shot, and the pepper jam maybe my favourite jam ever.

All my buddies enjoyed their food too, but they thought it was their dishes were slightly over seasoned, and the initial coffee given was luke warm, but were given a fresh cup once we pointed it out.

I only wished I was hungrier so I could have tried more... but I may need to come back to try the brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing place! amazing food! amazing time!  Really enjoyed everything about the Whitfield.  The vibe is great - not stuffy at all.  

Wasn't sure what to expect with the food - but it was simply delicious.  I spotted a few items I'd like to come back to try.  Service was awesome (ask for Jack-he's so friendly and had great recommendations).  Great variety on the drink selections as well as the menu.  

Really had a lovely time here and can't wait to come back.  I made reservations through open table - very easy to make the reservation and many available times."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about those blood orange glazed donut holes!!

Whitfield is in the Ace Hotel, right next to their lobby. I went for brunch on a Sunday and there was a 20 minute wait. They have the system where they text you after your seat is ready, so my friend and I window shopped in the surrounding area as we waited for our table. It was a surprisingly clear day, and the bright natural lighting coming through the windows made the space really aesthetically pleasing (insta-worthy, as a millenial like I would say). Lots of potted plants, nice chairs, the art on the walls... all befitting of a restaurant in a trendy hotel.

To start I ordered the Fairweather and my friend got a glass of orange juice. I would recommend the Fairweather if you love fruity tequila cocktails. 

Anyways, the donut holes!! I'm not really a donut-lover, which made me even more skeptical of spending $5 them (and once the dish came out I found out it was only 3 donut holes). But once I bit into one, I was amazed. Best donut holes with the best glaze. So warm and fluffy with a tangy blood orange glaze that really tasted like blood orange. The glaze made it it not too sweet which I really appreciated. I do wish they gave us at least 4 though. It was so hard splitting that third donut hole in half when I felt like I could just keep eating these forever.

For my food, I ordered the Whitfield Breakfast which is Eggs Benedict (my favorite!) with a beet and potato rosti. The eggs benedict was a classic rendition of the dish. My only gripe was that it was just a little salty for me, but it was still a top tier eggs benedict in my book. The ham they used was of substantial thickness and tasted great! The rosti on the side was very crunchy on the outside and a little soft on the inside, giving a fun textural experience. 

My friend got the roast beef sandwich which used really thick, crunchy/fluffy toast, and the portion of the the fried chicken salad I saw people getting looked humongous. I definitely need to come back to try more of their dishes (and to have more donut holes)!  This place can be a little on the pricier side, but it would be a nice treat to go again."}
{"text":"Lunch at the Whitfield -- food was great--Nicoise Trout Salad was exceptional.
Service was good not great.  Then the bill came -- $22.00 for a salad and hot
tea.  We asked for bread and were charged $2.00 for 2 slices of ordinary loaf bread!
Outrageous!"}
{"text":"Surprising find in east Liberty- excellent brunch!

Vegetarian perspective-
Lots of great salads and starters that are veggie friendly, however I just ordered the mushroom gravy with biscuits which was excellent and satisfied my southern food craving. It came with a savory shredded Brussel sprout salad and yummy green onions. Generous serving size.

My partner got the Whitfield breakfast which is like an eggs Benedict topped with chimichurri sauce which he loved. I also got to try some of the beet hash which he had on the side which was perfectly seasoned and a nice change from potatoes.

Seems like they have a nice prix fixe option for brunch which can include 2 dishes and a mimosa or Bloody Mary for $26.

Ambiance is great, lots of space with lots of light and service was great.

We had a 10:45 reservation but since they had plenty of seating they seated us early.

Looking forward to our next trip here! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and excellent service. Better than any steak house in Pittsburgh. Our server Sean took a great interest in making sure our experiences was excellent"}
{"text":"While the food was pretty good, our waiter and therefore service, was absolutely terrible. Don't go here expecting a smoothly run operation or top notch service. Pretty sure our waiter came over once, and screwed up 2 out of the 3 meals. Rude, too!"}
{"text":"We came hear with some out-of-town visitors for a Sunday brunch and we will be making sure we will be coming back! There is this nice vibe about this place that makes you want to stay there the whole day. The service was very friendly and efficient and the menu item selection very good. We all got different items and everything was great! Also one thing we have been struggling with lately is finding places where we can bring our 5 month old baby and this is a place that even though for some might appear to be loud we thought it was great and our little one enjoyed her stay there (with a nice nap)."}
{"text":"I went here for a lavish dinner with a big group this past weekend.  The Ace Hotel lobby is cool and a nice place to meet and have a pre-dinner drink but there is no separation between the lobby and the Whitfield so you feel like you are sitting in a hotel restaurant (which is different from the Ace Hotels I have been to in New York and LA where the restaurants are entirely separate spaces from the rest of the hotel).  In terms of the food, the oysters were good but a little small (makes me wonder how good their food sourcing is since larger oysters tend to be more prevalent during the colder months) but the beef tartar was spot on.  For the main course me and my friend split the 32 oz ribeye.  I ordered it rare/medium (as one should do at a fine steakhouse) but unfortunately we both wound up with sour stomachs.  That tends to be a sign that the meat is not particularly fresh (a steak that is top notch can be eaten almost entirely raw and not give you any stomach problem) and was probably frozen before being cooked and served.  For $65 I expect a top notch cut.  Service was also a little spotty."}
{"text":"I had a lovely brunch here with an acquaintance this past weekend and was quite impressed by the charming atmosphere, friendly service, and quality of the food. We made a reservation for Sunday at noon, but there were a few open tables when we arrived. I was happy at the prospect of not being too crowded.

Whitfield is in the lobby of the Ace Hotel, and a white metal divider covered in plants closed off the dining room from the rest of the hotel without making the space feel cramped. I appreciated the use of plants and artwork throughout the restaurant area. It was like hanging out in the apartment of someone with excellent taste in decor. 

There were a wide array of food options to choose from for brunch...one of the better menus I've seen in the city actually. I had a mimosa and a br√ªl√©ed grapefruit with some bacon on the side. The grapefruit was gorgeous-looking, topped with raspberries, pomegranate seeds, and a thin layer of caramelized sugar. It tasted even better than it looked, and I can't wait to have another one! The person I was with had the steak and eggs. It looked delicious and he seemed quite pleased, although his steak was somewhat overcooked. That was the only minor issue in an otherwise wonderful experience, so Whitfield gets a solid 5 stars from me. I will most certainly be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a former YMCA. It is now a hipster spot serving American fare with a twist. The primary twist is the high price. The secondary twist is that each menu item has one ingredient that does not compliment the rest. 

We tried a cheese ball appetizer that tasted like hot crumbly (not soft or smooth) orange cheese coated in spicy cornflakes. The cheese wasn't flavorful, just an assault of heat to the tastebuds. There were also 8 oily tortilla chips that were too delicate to scoop the cheese rock with. I stopped after two tries, but my friend ended up with a stomach ache after trying to eat 1/4 of the mass. 

The pirogies were thick and yummy. They were greasy and topped with onions and sour cream. But for $8 for 4 pirogies, I couldn't stop thinking about how many boxes of Mrs. T's I could have bought (3-4 boxes of 12 pirogies). 

The lemon ice cream was okay tasting. There was a tiny scoop that looked cute in the dish, but my mind was wandering, thinking of all the delicious food within a block and I was eating a ping pong ball of lemon ice cream like Leona's wasn't down the street in Zeke's coffee. 

Also, this overpriced \"American\" food is served on these mismatched dish ware that looks like it was stolen from your grandma's house. Give Granny her dishes back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one Friday. The atmosphere was great, the bar area was crowded because of some party, but the dining area was calm and spacious. We didn't have to wait for a table when we arrived around 12:30, but I'm sure that will change as more people discover it!

A full range of beverages was available, but our party stuck to lattes, drip coffee and espresso, all of which were great. The menu had brunch and lunch choices, around $15-20 each. I had the duck confit, which was very tasty but smaller than I hoped. In contrast, the burger was massive. My only critique would be to make the entrees more consistent in size or split the menu into larger plates and smaller plates. It's always awkward when you get such different sizes meals and some folks are still hungry!

We ended up sampling a bunch of desserts since some of us still had room in our stomachs. Easily the best part of the meal! I'm partial to the lemon mousse as it reminded me a lot of the lemon tart at la gourmandine. 

Overall great atmosphere, excellent service, and good variety on the menu. Will certainly return for a nice dinner at some point."}
{"text":"The Ace Hotel is finally open in Pittsburgh and they've brought along the aptly/geographically named Whitfield Restaurant for the ride!  I made my way here on a Monday evening just after their grand opening.  The hotel is adorable, the designers stayed true to the original architecture and charm of the original YMCA that was housed here, and the Whitfield sits just inside the main doors to your left.  

Our waitress, Angel, was a real angel and a total delight to engage with throughout the entire dining experience.  Lee and I ordered the semolina gnocchi as our appetizer: made with soft gnocchi, rabbit, beans, and braised olives.

For our entrees, Lee ordered The Steak, which is the chef's choice of cut for that day and on this particular day it was a sirloin.  The Steak is served with fries and a bearnaise sauce and was excellent all around.  I would highly recommend the bearnaise when choosing any of their beef options on the menu that have been carefully selected by the chef.

I ordered the smoked chicken and was not disappointed in the least. The portion sizes for all of our dishes were excellent, and my dish was no exception.  A large, smoked chicken breast with perfectly crispy skin, served over gravy and dumplings... so good! It's an upscale take on a good old fashioned, stick to your ribs chicken and dumplings that you'd get at your mom's house.   We also opted to share the bacon mac and cheese and holy Lordy was it good.  I think I might just order that as my meal next time!  The cheese sauce was the perfect consistency, and the panko and bacon topping was just crunchy enough.  We finished off our meal with a slice of the olive oil chocolate cake.

All around it was a wonderful experience. I'm so excited to have the Ace Hotel here in Pittsburgh and will absolutely be back to the Whitfield many times.  It's obvious that the staff, from the front of the house to the back, knows exactly what they're doing and I look forward to them keeping up this amazing, delicious work!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to dining at Whitfield and after my experience last night, I wish I had not waited so long.

First impression...this place is cool. It is the former East Liberty YMCA which has now been converted into the Ace Hotel. Ace is known for it's eclectic hotel renovations and this place lives up to it's billing. The restaurant and bar is located in the lobby of the hotel and the renovations retain virtually all of the features of the building's prior use. They even left the gym alone, other than removing the basketball hoops.

The bar and restaurant were packed with people. One thing you should be aware of if you are going to dine here is that this place is LOUD. There are virtually no soft surfaces anywhere on the floors or walls and the sound bounces around the place. I personally like that vibe, so it didn't bother me at all. If you're looking for a quiet romantic place for dinner, however, you may want to go somewhere else.

We had a 730pm reservation and arrived a bit early so we could have a drink before dinner. The bar area has a variety of seating options and the bartenders are excellent. 

We were seated within 10 minutes of our reservation time and our server was prompt and courteous. We were with another couple and the 4 of us ordered 2 38oz Porterhouse steaks to share. We also ordered salads and a few side dishes to accompany our entrees.

The wedge salad I ordered was perfect and the steaks (cooked perfectly medium rare) and side dishes were also excellent.

Here's why I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars:

When we were ordering our steaks, our server told us that there were only 3 left and suggested that he run back to the kitchen to get our order in before they ran out. This resulted in a couple of things I think smart diners should consider in that situation. First, I was curious as to how they were almost out of a most popular entr√©e at 730pm on a Saturday evening. You would think that they would try to have enough on hand to allow most diners to order them throughout the evening.

More importantly, when the steaks came out to our table, they were extremely fatty. The filet mignon side of the steak was almost all fat with very little meat. I guess that as the chef gets orders for this item during a dinner service the best steaks get selected first and by the time there are only 2 or 3 left they are probably of lesser quality.

The lesson I learned here is that if you are told that there are only 2 or 3 steaks left, and they cost $80 each, you should ask the server to show you the steaks before they cook them. I'm guessing that I would have selected another entr√©e had I been given that opportunity.

I want to be clear that the steaks were cooked perfectly and were among the best tasting steaks I have ever eaten. I just think that for $80, the steak should be wholly edible and ours were not.

Other than the issue described above, I truly enjoyed my evening at Whitfield. This is a great restaurant and I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a weekday and didn't seem that busy at that time. We started with the focaccia and also ordered the vegetarian tasting and the duck breast. The focaccia was pretty good but some bites were extremely salty. Our entrees were mediocre and we ended up not finishing our meal. I don't think the experience was worth the upscale price. 

Also, there is a bar that shares the same open space which starts blasting music towards the end of dinner. It was hard to hear what each of us was saying and it kind of killed the mood. Furthermore, the service was slow. There were only about three tables at the time but still getting the food and even the check was a struggle. 

But it seems that all the other reviewers had a stellar time, so this is probably an outlier experience."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast/brunch! Service was great-made reservation, but did not really need it since we came early on a Sunday. Had coffee special and Whitfield breakfast. Eggs were perfect, but beet side was a little overdone. Husband had Pastrami hash that he enjoyed, but was a little salty. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh stepped up it's Hotel game drastically in 2015, so I was very excited to visit our latest newcomer: the Portland based Ace Hotel. As of today, the hotel and its in-house restaurant - the Whitfield - have been in business for a month, and have already completely captured their Pittsburgh audience.

The vibe is a perfect fit for this city. Housed in the old East Liberty YMCA location, the exterior is unassuming and low key. You barely recognize it as a hotel, except for the Porter who welcomes you to the hotel. However, once inside, you begin to understand what the fuss is about. The marble floored entrance hall is sleek and simple, with the Concierge station set up to right of the entrance, the neatly styled bar to the far right, the entrance to the Whitfield to the left. The restaurant is separated by on oversized flowers cage, plants an all, which allows it to maintain an open space environment. 

The hostess was vibrant and lovely, seating me promptly for my 10:30 am reservation. I liked that they called earlier that morning to confirm headcount and reservation, I was mad at my own party for downsizing my reservation so drastically, but c'est la vie. My party of 5 sat against the back wall, so we had a lovely view of the entire space.

Our waiter, Andre, was cheerful, prompt and polite, immediately helping us for our water choice and coffee preference, and was steadily around for refills and any questions. For all the to-do, my party was lame and pretty much all ordered the same thing: The Whitfield Breakfast. For being featured prominently [brunch and prix fixe menu], it turned out to be a simple Eggs Benedict dish with a splash of chimichurri sauce. Honestly, that's an annoying and pretentious move which completely clashes with the unassuming vibe I was loving so much. If you're going to do that, make sure it's amazing, which in my case just didn't happen. Andrew asked us if we required any spices for our dishes before I took a bite, but it wouldn't have helped; one of my eggs was soft poached, the other hard poached, the hollandaise needed a kick, the hashbrown was somewhat cold and the chimichurri was just meh. I should have added a pinch of salt. [Sorry guys, this is my favorite dish and therefore I'm hard on it] 

Now to the uplifting part of the visit.

If you ask the front desk, you can schedule somebody to give you a tour of the Hotel, which is cool. Here a guide will show you one of the premier suites, the ballroom and show you a peek into the gym area, which is currently still being restored [set to open 2016]. The architect put great detail into capturing the spirit of the old YMCA, updating it to a modern 'sleekness', yet supporting the unassuming vibe of old East Liberty.

The suite was simple yet 'functional'; the wood theme running around the room is stained dark/black with functional knobs every foot or so. This is neat now you can hang accessories such as a guitar, thrift store knick knacks, or a fold up table on the wall. The bathroom is surprisingly large and fully tiled in red and black [floor] and yellow and black [walls], and it holds a clawfoot bathtub with simple black faucets. [these are on the sink as well]. An escape plan for each room hangs on a knob, hand-stitched into a piece of cloth. Snacks and beverages from local businesses are sleekly hidden away in draws and cupboards.

If you don't take the elevator, you can take the marble and elegant wooden staircase to the second floor ballroom, where the Hotel holds many an event, such as an art viewing or a NYE's party. The floor continues the red and black tile theme from the suite, and lots of natural light shines in from oversized windows. The white trim in the beams and over the exits is intricate and revives the feel of the old YMCA, and the full length sliding white doors which separate the room into two is my favorite detail. 

While the Gym area is still under construction, you can peek into the upper balcony. Plans include to highlight and lock in the old YMCA boxer mural painting, paying forward the inspiration of decades of memories. Until then, these memories remain captured in original photographs which hang on the wall to the first floor and to the basement. 

Conclusion, definitely take this tour.

I will need to come back for a second chance at the drinks and the dinner menu, for which I have heard very good reviews, but this dish for brunch I would skip."}
{"text":"If I could give a 6 star, I would.  All the right touches.  Lots of buzz/ hype but exceeds expectations.  Busy but accessible.  A wonderful oasis of great food in a city packed with wanna- be innovators.  Waiter was kind and knowledgeable.  Super hip, cozy.  Don't know what else to say.... great job Ace Hotel and the tremendous staff of the Whitfield.  Try the eggs benedict... it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The staff is hand picked to match the hipster decor. Got some pretty pretentious vibes here. The food was 3/10. They also charge 2$ for a side of ranch... why? Menu had no vegetarian options which is ironic because it's supposed to be hipster."}
{"text":"Solid 4  the atmosphere here was excellent: intimate, unique, inviting. The service was great, friendly an accommodating... they made my wife and I feel like we'd been there a thousand times even though it was our first. My favorite part of the whole experience is the vibe of the whole building, shared with the Ace Hotel; the bar across the way is lively and sexy, the gym down the hall is fun and casual. Very much a 30s-revival decor. The food was quite good, but I can't say it was the most memorable part of the experience. I'll admit that for the price you get what you'd expect but nothing more. All in all I would love to go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant really blew my expectations out of the water. Having staff open the door for you and take care of you throughout your meal really makes you feel special. You also see a lot more people than just your waiter which was really nice that everyone cares!
The food may have been sparse but was definitely enjoyable. There was a myriad of flavors to be had with each dish and you just have to take the time and savor those flavors. The Parsnip Bread was wonderfully baked to a nice soft center but a slightly crispy outside. Paired with the honey and the jam results in a not too sweet but extremely delicious. My mouth waters thinking about it again. 
The Gravy and Biscuits was interesting because it looked like sliders at first coming to the table. The scallions had a wonderful savoriness while contrasting with a refreshing pungent taste of the sprout salad. Both these are nice to contrast with the biscuits which are coated around and inside with the gravy. Eating them quite literally takes up the space in your mouth.
As for the fried apples I was pleasantly surprised because they weren't too covered in cinnamon or sugars, not to heavy in frying and the sauces were just right. The apples were soft and light, and definitely a nice end to the meal in fruity dessert-ness. 
All in all the portions are relatively small, but it is made up for by the flavor and deliciousness of the dish as well as the great staff who are constantly helping to make the experience great. There was no way that we could have asked for anything else from our waiter. Looking forward to trying the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place only got 3.5 stars. I love the vibe, food and service. Got Ni√ßoise salad, parsnip bread and duck confit which were all good."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for Monday brunch, so luckily, there weren't too many people! The ambience and vibe of this place is super modern, but casual. 

I ordered the Mushroom Gravy & Biscuits, which was amazingly flavorful and filling. The biscuits were fluffy and the gravy complemented it perfectly! I'm usually not a fan of vegetarian dishes, but I'd order this one again in a heartbeat. 

For dessert, my friend and I ordered the Daily Fancy Scoop (salted caramel ice cream) and the Passion Fruit Bombe. The ice cream wasn't too sweet since it was salted, and there were many chunks of caramel in it. I was just meh about the Passion Fruit Bombe though - I wouldn't get it again. Nothing special or great about it for the price."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for a birthday dinner and it did not disappoint! We had a lot of fun picking snacks from the bar menu and a couple of appetizers to try before going in on dinner. From the bar menu, we tried the pickled & deviled eggs, and the duck fat kettle corn. 

The eggs came as 3 servings of each type of egg (6 egg \"halves\") and were a great starter! The deviled eggs were pretty mustard-y, so the taste is a bit sharper than what I am used to, but still good!

The duck fat kettle corn was SUPER tasty! It still had the sweetness & crunch of kettle corn, but there was a hint of that rich duck flavor. A good snack that comes out quickly (served in a mug) and can be munched on throughout the meal!

For appetizers, we got the French onion soup and a lamb plate. The French onion was decent - it didn't have the cheese over top like we were hoping, but there was a giant crouton to compensate. Boyfriend has a low tolerance for Parmesan cheese, so I ended up eating most of the soup. The lamb small plate was very tasty - toasted bread, olives, onions, thin slices of lamb, and what seemed to be a light butter spread.

For entrees, I got the smoked cod and he got the duck (he's a big fan!). The smoked cod was very good - potatoes, greens, fish - very well balanced! There was a very sharp lemon salsa on top that tasted like lemon peel; on its own was intense, but tasty with the fish! Overall a lot of very strong flavors on the plate (citrus, smoked fish, butter greens, and a sharp, smoky sauce). The duck was a lot more mellow. It came with beets which gave everything a very pretty color as well! The duck was cooked well and not too oily, so that was great!

For dessert, we shared the lemon sundae with coffee. The dessert was really tasty, although I will admit that when we saw \"sundae\", we expected more ice cream than a small scoop. The bowl it was in had a great almond flavor and the dulce de Leche was tasty. Coffee was a great pairing :)

I had made the reservation with a note about celebrating a birthday, but neglected to mention it to the server when we sat down, so I can't report on what kind of birthday things they may do. However, it was pretty busy that night, and the server was great and attentive! A very nice place that we'll be adding to our list for special occasions!"}
{"text":"The newly-arrived Whitfield is already one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. The space is beautiful--the rehabbed old YMCA in East Liberty, with a spacious dining room, coffee bar, and bar/lounge area. The decor is spare, which creates a feeling of roominess and allows the architecture and building features to stand out.

The menu is incredibly solid, for both brunch and dinner. Some dinner standouts include the duck with honeyed beets, which is perfectly cooked (all fat rendered, crispy skin, rare-to-medium rare), the butcher's steak (a rotating daily steak special, which has been perfectly cooked each time I've ordered it, with crispy fries and bearnaise sauce on the side). The brunch menu is uber. Almost too many hits to list, but worth mentioning the bruleed grapefruit, with its sour, tender grapefruit sections under a crackable sugar crust, the parsnip bread served with honey and jam (dark, earthy, sweet), the out-of-this-world blueberry pancake with lemon creme fraiche (a single plate-sized, pillowy, thing), and whatever their donut special is. I also love their sandwiches--especially the beef with peppers and the pastrami sandwich.

Be aware that there are two different cocktail menus and I have a strong preference for the cocktail menu at the bar, where I have yet to experience a bad drink. The cocktails on the restaurant menu are a little more hit-or-miss, and a little bland. There are also a few special items on the bar menu that deserve mention, including the pierogies and the delightful affogato dessert (espresso poured over vanilla ice cream).

Dessert menus in Pittsburgh are sometimes a little weird. Here, the Whitfield truly excels. Desserts are flavorful, well-balanced, and I've yet to try one I didn't like. The shortbread and lemon mousse is particularly bright tasting, with the acid from the lemon balancing the sweet.

The service has been pretty standout. Wait staff is well-informed about the menu, pleasant, cheerful, and attentive without the weird hovering feeling you get. The place is always hopping, yet service is expedient without seeming rushed. A few weeks ago, we had a couple of weird visits where there seemed to constantly be food mix-ups in the kitchen. Wrong plates delivered to us and tables around us, items misread from the order, etc. However, we've noticed that these issues seem to have been very quickly resolved. A table numbering system in the bar area is helping with this a lot.

Really hoping to see the quality at the Whitfield continue at this level. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Whitfield and the food and service always exceed expectations. The menu is exciting and diverse with a nice selection of vegetarian and vegetable dishes. I especially love their brunch and always order the mushroom gravy and biscuits - flavorful and filling without being heavy and unique because I've never seen a vegetarian version before. Their coffee is good and fresh, and the Bloody Marys are perfectly spicy. The staff is great about answering questions and providing guidance on what to order. Shoutout to Dillion, who was super friendly, knowledgable, and on top of things!"}
{"text":"Good food but one thing that made the great food only good, almost everything our group ordered (besides the mac and cheese) was lukewarm.

First let's start out that this restaurant is located in a really cool place. It's the ACE hotel which was a former YMCA and yes, they still have the gym!

It was a beautiful night so we chose to eat outside.This place was very hipster and as you would expect they had craft beer, yum, lucky me.

I started off with some fried green tomatoes which were really good, I wish I would have know that it was going to be so small though otherwise I would have ordered more since I shared with people.

For the main I had rabbit, it was quite good just not at all warm enough. I tried someone else's duck and really liked it, however, not warm enough.

I am not a beef person but there were some people at the table that ordered the family style steaks and man were they ever big. Apparently this place orders whole cows in and cuts their own steaks.

Desert was good, I had the lemon cream or mouse or I forget exactly but it was quite nice. Had an espresso to go with it and... it too was not warm enough, now I know espresso should not be hot like some place make it, but seriously, this was not at all warm enough, at least it went with the lukewarm theme that the rest of the meal had.

One thing to note that if you sit outside after dark, there is no lighting and it is hard to see, we had to use our flashlights on our phones to read the desert menu! I did not have an issue but some people in my group did not like that.

Would I go back? Yes, but only if I could be gaurenteed a hot meal."}
{"text":"I went here recently in a weeknight with a  group of 7. The atmosphere is absolutely so cool. Right away our service was slow, getting waters, drinks and pretty slow throughout the dinner. I ordered a bourbon cocktail and it really wasn't that strong. Huge flaw when you can minimally taste the liquor. Our waiter overall was pleasant, just got an attitude once when someone tried to ask him something. I ordered  the duck dish and it was by far one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Everything was perfect. Several people got the short rib dish and were very disappointed - lots of fat they said. One person ordered the steak that the waiter raved about and he said it was definitely a good meal but not as hyped as made out to be. For me though, I will for sure return."}
{"text":"A very unique dining experience inside of the new Ace Hotel Pittsburgh. My husband and I enjoyed our Valentine's Day dinner at Whitfield. The atmosphere is intimate, trendy, and upscale casual. The service was prompt, friendly, and energetic. Our server actually made me really excited to be there for dinner!

The drinks list was unique and extensive, with some interesting cocktails and wines. We opted for some red blend and pinot noir from CA (forgive me, I can't remember the names!) and I was pleasantly surprised by both - interesting notes.

They are known for their farm-fresh beef from cows right over in Bedford, PA.The cuts are large and shareable, which made for a very cool experience. My husband and I shared the 48oz bone-in ribeye and it was flawless. It had phenominal marbling and we actually ended up cutting every morsel of meat of the bone.

What was even better than the steak were the sides. The brussel sprouts were so good that I almost ordered another helping. They are charred, crunchy, and delicious. We also shared the sauteed kale and red peppers. Everything was polished off and our plates were clean. 

The price is also right for the quality you receive. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the roast beef sandwich on the brunch menu and it was delicious! Came out piping hot. I think next time I would get the horse radish on the side so it doesn't soak into the bread but otherwise I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Had two drinks here in the late afternoon,no food, so a very short visit. There was some type of event going on so there were a lot of people strictly having drinks. The selection of beers is good, I found somethings that I had not seen in other local bars which is awesome. As for the bar itself, I have no idea what happened when they were designing it, the stools are drilled to the floor so that was uncomfortable as I had some very inconsiderate people sitting (and standing) next to me who kept on bumping into me. The bar just feels too short, and I don't feel that the table seating makes up for lack of seating at the bar. As a person that will go to a bar lone wolf from time to time I'm not going to go and sit at a table by myself (I guess that might just be me) but the bar here just seems to be annoying. Otherwise the bartender was excellent, drank the beers and left. Price for drinks is above average, but I can be forgiving because it is in the lobby of a hotel."}
{"text":"Disappointing, completely disappointing!! Popped in this restaurant for dessert only, and I ordered dessert, or I thought I did, but what I received was the essence of dessert, see pic for understanding.  This should have been listed as a \"taste of a dessert\"; I'm fairly sure that a scoop of ice cream would've been more substantial and is half the price. The dessert taste is listed on the menu as passion fruit brown butter cake with hibiscus; I could be missing a word, but unless you're restricted to 6 sugar carbs, then don't bother ordering this."}
{"text":"The Whitfield is out of this world. Everything is top-notch- the food, the atmosphere, the service. The food is excellent! Get the steak. It's unbelievable, juicy, and super flavorful. Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had. The bearnaise sauce accompanied it perfectly! The sides were amazing, too. I had the carrots au gratin and the shishito peppers. They were awesome!! 

The server was friendly and the food came out really fast!

I recommend Whitfield to anyone who wants an unforgettable dining experience in Pittsburgh. It's wonderful!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Whitfield and usually have their breakfast.  It's generally o.k.  - the massive pancake they serve is really tasty but just too big for a reasonable person to consume.  It screams American in every way.  I actually feel bad eating it knowing hunger issues abound, and that usually never happens to me, but it's definitely triggered by this ostentatious thing - I'd  feel much better if they made a much smaller version, and out of principle restricted service of the thing to 2 or more diners.

Service is hipster and grungy but the hotel is trying really, really hard to make sure you're aware of all that, so try to appreciate the extra effort they're making, even if it is contrived.

I've honestly had better, but some of the better spots are jam packed for weekend breakfast, and while this fills up, no one is going to wait outside in the snow for 30 minutes to eat there...

Consider the 3-star rating very weak"}
{"text":"Celebrated an early valentine's here for dinner. Excellent decision!

It was a Sunday night, and even though we were early for our reservation, we got seated right away. Not too crowded, but we were not the only ones there.

My partner and I are somewhat difficult: I'm vegetarian, and he has Celiac's disease. Luckily, Whitfield has a vegetarian tasting menu and several options. The waiter was super helpful about finding gluten free options for my partner as well.

I went with the veggie tasting menu, which consisted of beet tartar, risotto cakes on black-eyed peas, and a vegan chocolate mousse with coconut and kaffir lime.

Loved the beet tartar. It was briny and flavorful. If you're not a pickle fan, then I don't recommend it.  The risotto cakes were good, and the black-eyed-peas had a smokey taste that is hard to achieve without meat. Very impressive. The chocolate mousse was very thick and rich. I could have handled less coconut, but that's just me.

I had a gimlet from their cocktail menu, and it was a nice cucumber-y twist on the classic. I also tried one of their fancy french ciders, and it drank like champagne (shocking, I know).

Because it wasn't crowded, service was prompt. The atmosphere is nice, with great (read: flattering) lighting. Very happy with the experience. I hope they do the veggie tasting menu seasonally, so I can come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!

Pros:

- cool, bright, energizing atmosphere
- big menu
- good food 
- reasonably priced
- no issues customizing order
- prompt service 

Cons:

- side of fruit, while delicious, was a bit small"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. The vibe is very cool and relaxed. The interior has such an authentic throwback feel. It really works. Two quite good cocktails and one miss between my wife and I. Dinner was four of us. Server was nice, but in way too much of a rush to take our order. Really felt like we were being pushed (disrupting the relaxed vibe), which, given the number of people in the lobby/bar area as we were leaving, we probably were. Food overall was good. Everybody enjoyed their meal. Wanted a bit more smoke flavor in my smoked chicken and the dish needed something to lighten it a bit. I like homestyle cooking, but this was a bit too much so for the price point. My wife's fish dish was excellent. Olive oil chocolate cake was excellent. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Pretty hipster place in the Ace hotel. The restaurant is right as you come into the lobby and the very awesomely rustic/chill bar is on the other side of the lobby. Despite being right in the thick of things it totally works. It's a very community vibe to it. 
We had a group of 6. I recommend reservations. It was pretty consistently busy. 
Service was attentive enough and casual but friendly. All of our needs were met. We started with two orders of donut holes with the apple Carmel sauce. Yeah-get those. Everyone liked what they got. The folks that got the eggs benedict thing loved it. My friend loved her biscuit and gravy- totally loved. And I had the basic breakfast with eggs, homemade sausage, home fries and bread. I recommend getting their homemade English muffin...cause homemade English muffin. The home fires were a bit spicy and just ok. Not cause they were spicy just because they were nothing special. The scrambled eggs were the best eggs I've ever had.  Don't know why but they were amazing!!!  The only meh at the table was the pancake. It's a skillet pancake and probably a good one if that's your thing. But nothing about was really that great...even though we tried it with the lemon stuff that came with it (which was stupendous). 
The menu items on the lunchier side looked amazing. It was had to not go that route.  I plan to go back because the vibe was awesome a super conducive to a brunch with friends and the food was very good. Also loved the bar and want to check that out."}
{"text":"Most disengaging bartender ever! Food and drinks were great but the bearded bartender needs some personality! Many other great choices in the area!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh.  The vegetarian tasting menu is great which I have tried couple times and liked it a lot. Cocktails are in my opinion one of the best in Pittsburgh and even tho there are few beer options, there is always some great options.  Service is friendly and attentive. I even once got 10% discount in my bill because the food came somewhat late without me even complaining about it or anything. the atmosphere is also pleasant.  One of my usual to-go places to have a nice dinner or a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Just really incredible. I had brunch here recently and cannot wait for an occasion to come back for dinner!! This is one of the few fancy/upscale restaurants in Pittsburgh that's actually worth the price.

The cocktails were interesting and delicious. The duck leg confit was beyond any that I have had before. Seriously. I know that in theory it's like, \"what's not to like about duck leg confit??\" Well, let me tell you, this duck leg confit is crispier, juicier and more tender than whatever you are thinking about.

Dessert was delicious as well. I highly recommend the passionfruit bombe. Oh man. Just go and try it."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place, we finally ventured to Whitfield one Saturday afternoon (around 2pm). Surprisingly, they couldn't seat us, even though there were many empty tables. That wasn't a deal breaker for us because we weren't all that hungry, and so we took the hostess' suggestion about hanging out at the lounge until a table becomes ready. It was a nice lounge -- comfortable chairs, airy ambiance, old school board games for passing the time, good bars too. Eventually, the hostess led us to our table; she was very apologetic. Despite the long wait, I was positively dispositioned toward the restaurant.

Sadly, the actual wait staff was pretty incompetent.  Even though he took our cocktail orders, nothing materialized for 15 minutes. When asked, he replied that he was \"busy\" and hadn't had the chance to go to the bar yet... except that I could see him hanging out chit-chatting with another server the entire time (it's not a big restaurant). Much of the meal service ran like this. He was a bit surly in attitude too, not just toward our table but to nearby tables as well (such as when they asked him for a hotter cup of coffee). My patience and interest took a huge dive while we waited for our food.

Luckily for them, the kitchen redeemed itself. Most of our orders were from very good to excellent. I enjoyed every bite of my duck leg (\"comfit\", the waiter corrected me -- even though the menu only printed \"duck leg\" without specifying whether it's comfit or not); the potato soup was decent; and the sandwiches my companions got were good too. We had revived enough interest to think about ordering dessert. However, after the waiter left the dessert menu with us and didn't check back for another 15 minutes, we finally gave up.

I would love to try this place again, hopefully after the server quality has gone up."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for a belated Valentine's day dinner, to try something different from one of our go-to special occasion restaurants, and it was a fantastic experience.  It's very \"different,\" but in the best way possible.  The atmosphere is a mix of classic dining with hipster flair, the kind of restaurant where you feel like you want to wear your Sunday best while your tatted-up waiter wears jeans and a rolled up t-shirt (which, in retrospect, is kind of redundant with the whole hipster description, but I digress).  It is pricey, but the food is well worth it.  I will say that they had a very busy weekend, so when we went, they had sold out of steak, which I hear is something they're known for.  We aren't big steak people, so it didn't effect us, but if that was your primary reason in going, I could see how that might have been a bit disappointing.  We had the Sunday supper pasta and the pork shank.  The pork was amazing... a sweet-sour kind of thing going on, with all of the comfort of a slow braise.  Total winner.  For dessert we shared the olive oil chocolate cake, which you can probably find referenced in 95% of the reviews of this restaurant, because it is *$%*$^* amazing, and more than shareable.  The cocktails, also, were fantastic (I highly recommend the rye and shine...the combination of rye, orange, and cold brew is one I've started to see on a lot of menus lately, and the Whitfield does it exceptionally well).  Friendly service, comfortable atmosphere, great food.  I'm stingy with 5-star reviews, but this gets it for me.  Can't wait to go back to try the brunch.  Oh, and I second the reviews that say get reservations.  It isn't a huge restaurant, and it gets pretty busy."}
{"text":"I finally ate here after a year of it being on my places to try in Pittsburgh. I was not disappointed at all. As a whole, the waiter was pleasant and professional, my cocktails were some of the best I have had, and a totally unpretentious ambiance you can actually relax in. I had the duck breast for my entr√©e. It was a trip out of this world! The skin was perfectly crisped from one corner to the other, the spaetzle was a brilliant ingredient to the dish as it was fried and added texture, the beets and cabbage provided the perfect sweet and sour to the dish. I highly recommend this place for a date night or for a great place to unwind if you are looking for amazing cocktails."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my experience at Whitfield! We made a reservation two days in advance and came here on a Sunday for brunch at noon. The restaurant is located within the Ace Hotel. We found limited metered street parking right in front of the hotel (free on Sundays). Upon speaking to the host, we were almost immediately seated in the well-lit and comfortable restaurant. Our server was very friendly and attentive, which we are very grateful for. We ordered one order of blood orange donut holes and my boyfriend and I finished the three and decided to put in another order. We also ordered an eggs benedict for him and the three egg omelette for me. His came with a side of potato-beet hash, which we were hesitant but pleasantly surprised by it... it was delicious! For the eggs benedict itself, the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise was very delicious (and I'm not usually a fan of hollandaise). For my omelette, I substituted my side salad for fruit and there was a $1 upcharge. I like hot sauce, especially on my eggs, and they had this delicious homemade hot sauce that has ghost pepper, ginger, peaches among the ingredients. They also had cholula and sriracha, which I very much appreciated. We had a fabulous experience and highly recommend Whitfield! They also offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner, in addition to the wonderful brunch."}
{"text":"The ACE hotel is trendy and the restaurant follows suit.  For those that do not know, the ACE hotel is in an old YMCA.   The decor is super hip/trendy.  We arrived without reservations (which I would not recommend).  While waiting, we had a drink at the bar.  The bar was cool and the drinks were good.  They made a  great Moscow Mule!

When we were finally seated, I noted the seats to be comfortable.  The server took our drink orders and returned with libations promptly.  He was helped a few in our party make a selection.

I had the oysters to start.  The were well prepared and chilled appropriately.  The accompanying sauce went well with them.  I also had the Brussels Sprouts.  They were crispy as the menu indicates.  Nothing special about these.  Seem to be the way that everyone is doing Brussels Sprouts now.  

Friends said the steak was good, but I did not try myself.

For desert, we shared the creme brulee as well as the olive oil chocolate cake. The both hit the spot.  I have had better of each, but the group liked both.

The food is above average.  It is a little on the pricey side for what you get, but I liked it.  If you dont want a meal, come for drinks and dessert just to see the place.  It is pretty cool how the renovated the old YMCA.  Go ACE!"}
{"text":"I have done an occasional brunch here and their biscuits and gravy are one of my favorite things ever!! The completely vegetarian mushroom gravy blows my mind. They have a great bar that I usually seat myself at. Friendly bartenders and waitstaff. Usually pretty packed for brunch! This place is on the fancier side but the prices are really not bad at all, and you leave feeling full. I'd recommend bringing somebody here that you'd like to impress :).

Ps. If they are serving the Rosemary tea latte, get it. Perfectly sweet. Perfect amount of rosemary flavor. And warm milk."}
{"text":"This is in a oh so hipster hotel. I met a friend for lunch; it was our first time there. I ordered the chicken salad, which I hated. So unfortunately, I don't have anything positive to say."}
{"text":"The Ace Hotel is such a cool spot for a night out, and Whitfield is a great place to start your night. 

As a Historic Preservation Consultant by trade, it's impossible for me to not start by commenting on the beautiful and tasteful reuse of the space. The lobby bar and restaurant fit well within the historic space, and the Ace Hotel's continued use of the old gymnasium for events is so fun!

Whitfield provides a really great ambiance to enjoy a semi-casual, well prepared meal with great service. They only have a few vegetarian options, but the star of the show here is their Butcher's menu - though there's nothing they do poorly, and the vegetarian entrees are delicious as well. 
Come with a group and try some of everything!

The lack of a fifth star may just be me being picky, but I don't think it's *one of the best* meals I've had lately. However, it was really enjoyable, and next time I'm heading out to dinner and don't have somewhere new in mind, I'll give Whitfield a second shot. (I've also heard they do a great brunch, so I'm going to try to come back for that!)"}
{"text":"While I could see the atmosphere being challenging for some, though I found it charming, everything about our meal from service to taste was exceptional. 

We started off with the Butchers Plate app, which challenged our comfort zone but turned out to be delicious. From rabbit to duck to bacon jam, variety of flavors excited the pallet. 

Who ever heard of family style steak? We had the 32 oz ribeye cooked perfectly. It was like butter. You could choose from a variety of sauces but I don't know why you would do anything more to that steak than just put it in your mouth. For sides we tried the crispy Brussels sprouts and potato fingerlings. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I was there for breakfast. Ambiance is nice trendy. 
Food was very very good! I recommend all baked goods as they make them themselves as well as the meats for the sandwiches!! I will go back any day."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today to check the place out, after hearing some really good things. I had the biscuits and mushroom gravy. Quite good, but I must say that the saut√©ed ramps stole the show! I couldn't quite place the seasoning...simple, yet so unique...lemony peppery amazingness? Regardless, I'll be back for more. The br√ªl√©ed grapefruit has my name all over it."}
{"text":"Went to Whitfield for lunch as I was waiting for a nearby shop to open.

Yes, Whitfield is comparatively pricey but that's the price you pay for hipster/boutique aesthetic being inside the Ace Hotel in an converted YMCA building.  And ya, I have to admit -- the place is pretty cool.  Be sure to check out the gym and grab a photobooth pic for $5.

But the food was pretty solid - I grabbed the cheeseburger ($15) and the lady got mushroom gravy and biscuits ($11).  The burger was high-grade and cooked to order on a brioche bun with fried onions and some waffle chips (the potato is its highest form).  The burger was excellent.  Had a bite of her dish and it was good too.

Yes, trendy places like this are polarizing - but service was good and the food was reasonably priced.  I can't fade it."}
{"text":"Came here recently with some girl friends for dinner on a rather busy weekday night. It was my first time to the ACE hotel, and first time at the Whitfield. I had high expectations because my friend always raved about the ACE hotel, but my experience was quite underwhelming.

Value: 3/5
We ordered some appetizers to share, an entree each, two desserts to share, and one bottle of wine to share. The appetizers were around $10-12 each, but were so tiny that I thought the beet salad looked more like a side than a full-on appetizer. We split everything equally, and at the end of the night my bill came to be $58 (before tip). For the experience I had, I've had better for that pricepoint elsewhere.

Taste: 3.5/5
Overall: everything was as expected of a restaurant at the price point and ambiance of the Whitfield. Nothing special. I could get a better meal elsewhere in Pittsburgh for the prices, though.
Appetizers: Oysters of the day - they were okay; normal tasting; beet salad - it was alright, the cheese was good on it
Entrees: Rainbow trout - pretty good, except a little too salty; pork chop - good texture, and the charred bits are good
Desserts: Chocolate-covered cheesecake - the texture of the cheesecake was very nice, presentation was good, and taste was good; rhubarb pie deconstruction - it seemed like the restaurant tried to copy 'oops i dropped the lemon tart,' but the composition and the balance of flavors was not there

Experience: 3.5/5
Our overall dining experience lasted for two and a half hours - mind you, it was not fine dining so we did NOT expect to stay at the restaurant for that long. Most of the time, we were waiting for our entree to arrive. Between the time our appetizers were finished and the entree's arrival was around an hour. By then the crowds of people had trickled down to a minimum, and our table was one of the last tables still having dinner at the Whitfield.  The server was courteous throughout the dinner, but the whole experience of waiting really killed my mood."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very good. The vibe is fun and they had a DJ with very good music a few nights ago. 

We had small bites only but they were all very good. 

My friend had Mac and cheese, I had grilled shishito peppers as well as the lamb carpaccio. 

I have to say the main menu items were quite expensive, especially the steaks. For Pittsburgh the prices were a bit intense. However, the small plates were priced appropriately. 

My friend said the Mac and cheese was good. 

The bowl of shishito peppers was excellent, and there were a lot! More than enough to share. 

The lamb carpaccio had red beet salad in the middle but it did overpower the lamb quite a bit. 

However overall it was good and I would like to go back to try their entrees as well!"}
{"text":"Everything was pretty much perfect. Service impeccable, atmosphere cool if a bit too loud for us olds, and the ribeye was legitimately outstanding. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday evening for dinner with my wife and another couple.  We had made reservations a couple of weeks ahead of time for 6:30 PM and whenever we arrived at 6:25 PM our table was ready.  The inside of the Whitmore is quite a weird space as it is almost in the lobby for the hotel with only a latticed trellis type item as a separator.  That means that the considerable noise from the bar and lobby made it hard to hear people at our table talk.  Other than that there wasn't much to speak of in terms of decor as it seemed a rather plain place with high ceilings and some weird music.  At one point I swear that it sounded like there were playing the music of a drum circle but couldn't exactly be sure with all the noise.

For dinner I decided to have the duck breast entree with sides of crispy brussels sprouts and bacon Mac and cheese while my wife went with \"the steak\".  Upon ordering it she was given the choice of a sirloin or a flat iron and she chose the flat iron.  A couple of minutes later our server came back and let her know that it was actually a choice between a flank steak and a sirloin and so my wife went with the flank steak.  After a little bit of a wait our meals were delivered to us.  My entree consisted of a duck breast over top of a bed of spatzle intermixed with pepitas, beets, sweet and sour cabbage and duck confit.  Overall I thought that my entree was very good as the duck was cooked nicely and I loved the german sides underneath.  I especially loved the fact that they doubled up on the duck with both the breast and the confit.  The crispy brussel sprouts were also very good as they were nice and crunchy while being well seasoned.  Last but not least was the Mac and cheese which was easily the most disappointing part of my meal.  It's not that it was bad as it clearly wasn't but it could have used something more.  Maybe a cheesier sauce or perhaps some bigger chunks of bacon instead of the bacon bit like pieces that were in it.

The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't come here again in the future.  It's not because of the food which I thought was excellent and on its own deserved a 4.5 star rating.  I just really didn't care for the atmosphere, hipster vibe and loud noise which made conversation difficult."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene! In fact, Whitfield was such a lovely experience all around that I was inclined to sign up for yelp to let everyone else know that they must give this gem a try! And the fact that brunch is served everyday .. need I say more?!

My mimosa to start was delectable. It was followed by the Bruleed Grapefruit which was a refreshing little slice of heaven. The crispy, sugary coating with the blueberries and pomegranate seeds on top was not only beautiful to look at but a light and tasty appetizer. For my main dish, I tried the Whitfield Breakfast: Poached Eggs, Housemade English Muffin, Roasted Pork, Hollandaise, Chimichurri, & Hash Browns. I did not leave one bite behind -- it was incredible! The housemade english muffin added a nice element to the dish and the meat was tender and full of great flavor. I wish I had room for dessert because I wanted to try every single option on the menu! 

I will definitely be back very soon and will continue to spread the word about this new hot spot. The staff was delightful and service was really top-knotch."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to hate everything about this hipster spot, I just can't. It is easily one of the top 5 meals I have ever eaten. I NEVER order anything chicken or pasta while out, however based on the chicken dish including everything that I love I had to give it a try. One word.....UNREAL! Halfway through I needed to take a break because I literally felt like I was tripping balls, that is how good this meal was. I seriously thought I was having an out of body experience, from a damn chicken dish!!! I will without question be back. I wish the chefs the best of luck in their pursuit of eventually winning a James Beard award. One important thing to note, the service was the same as the food...next level. It may have helped that my brother in law had some connections there that were giving us the royal treatment but I don't care, I took it all with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, terrific food and the worlds MOST amazing coffee bar. Do yourself a favor and stop by, relax and enjoy the vibe."}
{"text":"If anyone deserves a super duper delicious rating it's this place. Cozy and in a cool atmosphere - an old YMCA building, turned into the Aces Hotel - you will find ample drinks and creative, solid locally sourced food. The Sunday supper is a great deal, including bread, salad and the special of the night. I had beef ragu over tagliatelle. The lemon butter with the bread was a fresh surprise. The salad was a tad boring but had crunchy fresh greens. The other courses knocked it out of the park. My husbands butchers cut steak (the chefs chosen cut, lives on the pub menu and comes with fries and b√©arnaise) was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Every bite at this place was fresh and decadent. Dessert was the banana fudgescicle and it was all I could do not to lick the plate. I highly recommend. Go with time to spare for the gym area with ping pong and cornhole!"}
{"text":"Been for brunch and dinner - never disappointed. My partner and I live a couple blocks away, so it's an easy walk from home. We love popping in for Sunday brunch - sitting at the bar and having a couple bites and cocktails. Theres such a lively atmosphere and the food continues to be outstanding !! Great quality, consistently prepared, and visually great to look at."}
{"text":"It's a downtown experience that's in my neighborhood. Darrion was our server & the drinks, food & atmosphere were amazing! Will be back! The carrots au gratin are with it, along side a manhattan."}
{"text":"When I made reservations, I asked for a quiet table.  I was told I would be accommodated. Upon arriving at the restaurant we found out that there was no such thing as a quiet table.

We asked for bread.  Apparently, bread does not come with your meal.  Ok, we want bread, so we are ok paying for it.  We asked for butter.  It arrived with lard, not butter. 

Trying to find someone to get us the butter, but can't tell who works there, staff dressed very casually.  Found our waiter and got the butter.

Orders placed.  Order not written.  Meal arrives, without the fingerling potatoes that we asked for.  \"OH, I'll put them in for you\".  

Meal is mediocre.  Potatoes arrive, didn't like them.  

I would not recommend this place.  Ruined our evening."}
{"text":"This hotel could really be something.   However, I encountered the following issues, which in the end amounted to no more than 2 stars:  1. Upon entering room (in the summer), freezing temperatures due to excessive A/C.  Ever heard of global warming?  2. Upon entering room, radio constantly and endlessly running.  (I think I might be able to decide for myself if I want to listen to the radio, plus again: waste of energy).  3. They have a great breakfast of biscuits with mushroom sauce.  The first time, it was delicious, the second time the sauce was room temperature at best and the entire thing tasted really unpleasant.  Hard to believe they are ruining their own food, because they cannot be bothered to serve it at the right temperature.  4. Valet parking:  Took about 15 minutes for them to get the car.  This is unacceptable.  They should simply give customers the option to get the car themselves rather than force them to wait 15 minutes.  5. Noise level in dining area rather high."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the burgh right now.  The menu and cuisine are so thoughtfully curated.  The flavors and dishes are innovative and clearly very considered.  From the appetizers to the entrees to the dessert, this place is legit.  This is so clearly more than just a restaurant in a hotel or a hotel restaurant.  The food is world class, especially for the prices they are charging which are entirely reasonable for Pittsburgh or even cheaper than I would expect.  Don't pass up this restaurant or it's food.  You will be surprised and delighted from start to finish.  They've done a fantastic job and this should be on a \"must eat\" list for the city.  I will be coming back as it's now my favorite cuisine in the city."}
{"text":"Great selection of desserts, however I wasn't as excited about their entrees. 

It taste about the same as any other contemporary American restaurant with a hefty price tag.   The atmosphere is about the same as any other modern restaurant, appealing to the bourgeois sensibilities."}
{"text":"I love a lot of things about Pittsburgh, but one of my favorite things is how when you throw French fries on any kind of dish, it becomes 'Pittsburgh style.' So now my favorite kind of salad is a Pittsburgh style salad such as the one at Whitfield, in the Ace Hotel. First of all, it's a fried chicken salad with ranch dressing, and then they throw fries on it, so it's really not even a salad, but it's as tasty as you would imagine. 

There are lots of other indulgent options on the menu including biscuits and gravy, a burger, or steak and eggs, as well as some healthier sounding options like a Nicoise salad, but I'd venture to guess maybe this isn't the spot for you if you're not in the mood to splurge a bit!"}
{"text":"Hip joint with really great, fun food and cocktails. Matcha donut balls, blueberry pancake and Whitfield Cheeseburger."}
{"text":"The menu looked great, but service was slow, and food was OK. I had 'the steak' which was quite tough, but was paired with a nice bernaise, and fries. I had higher expectations, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"Set in the Ace Hotel, the former YMCA, the Whitfield is a very trendy restaurant with eccentric staff and good food. Our group ordered numerous appetizers which were all good. Since they did not have a vegan option, I allowed the chef to surprise me with a dish. I love surprises so this was not a big deal for me. What was delivered was very good although I probably wouldn't have grilled escarole again as it is difficult to cut. Imagine the sight of someone stuffing a big bunch of greens in their mouth as chunks of black char litter the plate. I wouldn't order this if it is your first date. Outside of that, it was good. For dessert, I had a peanut butter banana vegan thing that was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Dinner on Saturday April 30. Whitfield is a hip spot. It is the restaurant venue in the Ace Hotel PGH which was crafted out of an Old YMCA. Much of the buildings original decor and fixtures remain giving the trendy location an organic and historic feel. Whitfield serves breakfast,lunch and dinner. Last night the vibe was energetic and decidedly local.  A huge selection of craft beers and creative cocktails awaits. The two we tried were both excellent sadly I don't recall the names. One was a crisp gingery mule that was really great. We passed on the first course offerings although several sounded excellent instead selecting two sides to start. Grilled Ramps had a smoky carmelized flavor and tasted great. Ramos have a very short season so this was a timely opportunity not to be missed. The Shisedo peppers were as well done as in any tapas restaurant we've enjoyed. Entrees were a a flavor flaky pan seared trout and my smoked chicken and dumplings. Both were A+. The wine list is limited but offers excellent selections both glass, 250 ml pours and bottle. Our server Josh was the best. Informed and friendly. But only at the table when we needed for him to be. Also recommend the olive oil chocolate cake and the rhubarb vanilla ice cream dessert. 

All and all one of the best experiences since moving to PGH. Bravo Whitfield!!"}
{"text":"OVERALL: classy environment with a variety of fairly-priced and delicious brunch options. Fantastic service. Would definitely come again. 

I went to Whitfield for Sunday brunch and was first pleasantly surprised at how elegant the restaurant was. The menus also matched the general ambience, which was comforting and quite aesthetic. 

My friends and I decided to start off with donut holes, which were covered in matcha sugar. It came relatively fast, given how many people were in the restaurant. The donut holes were deliciously crispy and sugary, just what you'd want in a sugary appetizer. It also had raspberry glaze on the plate, which, in combination with the donut holes, made it an enchantingly sweet experience. I definitely recommend the matcha donut holes.

I decided on two eggs (scrambled), home fries, sausages, and toast for my meal. I don't often say this, but I felt like the toast was the highlight of my dish. Also, our waitress was lovely - she always came to check up on us and even gave me strawberry jam.  The toast itself was crispy and buttery, and the jam was great to go with it. The sausages were also good, and the home fries had an interesting cajun flavor. The eggs were a bit lackluster compared to the meal - I felt like it could've used more flavor, and were not fluffy enough. However, overall it was a solid meal. I give the dish a 4/5, and the donut holes a 5/5.

I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who likes brunch in a nice, classy ambience."}
{"text":"A very satisfying feast for the stomach and the eyes! I loved the food as well as the presentation, it was very aesthetically pleasing. As a foodie and an avid instagrammer, I praise this restaurant. My friend and I went for Sunday brunch. Although the hostess had accidentally given our table to someone else, she was able to reseat us promptly. Unfortunately it was under some direct sunlight that couldn't be reached with the drapes, but as time passed, so did the problem.

We decided to order the Whitfield breakfast, blueberry buttermilk pancake, and bacon Mac and cheese. We could not finish it. The portions were of a decent to large size and for two small girls, ordering three dishes, regardless of how delicious and decadent, was a financial mistake! It's okay though, it was worth getting to taste all the foods. The pancake was more like a cake than a pancake, served singularly. The Whitfield breakfast was gorgeously colored, rainbow almost. The Mac and cheese was creamy and had a great crust. I almost wished I had only gotten that! 

To top this, the hotel the Whitfield was in also had a Christmas dog centered event. We got to see lots of dogs and Christmas themed activities, as well as use their real film photo booth.

It was a great meal and experience as well. I would go back!"}
{"text":"An interesting menu in a hipster setting. A little pricey for breakfast, but if you're looking for something different it's a nice spot to check out.  We tried the dulce leche donut holes on top of a peach compote and it was very good - downside is you only get four donut holes for $5.  They offer cold brew coffee and a full cocktail list for a pleasant brunch experience.  Server was polite and attentive."}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times. The service and food is consistently excellent. Last night's Valentines Day dinner was truly exceptional; oysters and pickle plate to start, a perfectly cooked steak and wonderful desserts. I love the vibe on the occasions where we've hung out and ordered food from the lobby lounge and bar area. Dog friendly and great coffee bar too. Cannot say enough good things about this place and the Ace in general."}
{"text":"WHY AM I WRITING ABOUT CHARRED LETTUCE??? WHYYYYY? BECAUSE THE GRILLED ESCAROLE IS SO //FREAKING// AMAZING! (I just had to figure out a way to increase emphasis while already yelling in all caps.) Seriously though, I go back there for brunch all the time JUST to have that on the side of my dish.

The little donuts you get for brunch are ::kissing your fingers italian face emoji:: (thats a thing right???). Getting perfectly made lattes with your brunch? Magnifico! (going to continue this italian chef stereotype things I've got going here) Pancakes are ACTUALLY panCAKES - i.e. big an fluffy and not flimsy little waifs of pastry. Duck Leg for Brunch??? SI SI Please! Pastrami Hash - just fill me up (as long as I can have some escarole on the side... well, the side of everything.)

Also, it's like stepping into a real life instagram post. I like that vibe, I'm not gonna lie. I'm a super basic b!tch and I own it. But DAMN DANIEL that food is good to go along with it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend for Easter brunch today. The first thing I ordered couldn't be made free of my allergy so I had to pick another item. I ordered the Whitfield cheeseburger instead. When it first came out the burger had items I requested it didn't have (which wasn't a big deal) but it was completely raw on the inside. They took back to cook it and it was completely the same, raw. 
On top of that there was a 1.5 inch solid piece of something in it (cartilage maybe?) that was so hard my fork could go through it. I notified the waitress and she explained it was probably a piece of meat that didn't go through the grinder as the grind everything in house - whatever this was, was NOT edible meat. 
Even after all of the screw ups the only offered $3.75 off my bill. I have never received such horrible service from a restaurant, and will never eat there again."}
{"text":"ate here last saturday. ambiance wasn't my scene. very noisy ...tables close together...such that servers bonked my husband on more than one occasion.  took forver to get us drinks (and our reservation was on the early side...before 6!!!) drinks were good and apps were fine.. we had beef tartare and beet salad with fried goat cheese - which had wayyyyyyy too much dressing ...mains were disappointing - i had the steak special which wasn't very special....steak was fine but no green veg and the fries were unevenly cooked. some crisp some soggy. my husband had the pork shank which he didn't finish because it was flavorless and not as tender as it should have been...the meat was dry. needless to say we skipped dessert. I feel like they worked hard on the space...and on making u feel like you'd just walked into brooklyn...which is great I guess? I live in pittsburgh. just very underwhelming. zagats hype brought us in...but the experience will not be bringing us back."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and found a cool restaurant inside the converted YMCA now known as the Ace Hotel. The staff were super friendly and we were seated quickly. We started with the donut holes which were good but not great and for our entrees we ordered the blueberry buttermilk pancake and the Whitfield breakfast (Eggs Benedict) The pancake was very fluffy and thick and had fresh blueberries inside the batter with a hint of lemon. The Whitfield breakfast was by far the favorite! Also we ordered a vanilla iced latte which was delicious!"}
{"text":"I should start with saying how much I like what Ace Hotel does. The Whitfield breakfast was simply delicious and as good as everything else was everyone wished they had ordered it as their course. I've never seen a pancake like theirs and have no idea how they get it that thick and still the texture of a pancake-just awesome. Oh, and the specialty coffees are a must."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago for coffee....and the coffee area....across from the restaurant is worth a trip just for the coffee and desserts.  We stopped for a late lunch and it was fabulous.  Service was great....nice to know the dessert chef took a risk to come to Pittsburgh!  The squash soup was fabulous with a hint of cayenne. The parsnip bread was a great companion to the soup - suggested by our waiter.  The restaurant has not been opened that long, so some of the negative comments can be expected.  I will be back.  By the way, a suggestion:  I did have a bite of the burger ordered and it was really yummy.  I would order it if there was a smaller version....it was the best burger I have ever tasted...and I am not a burger girl...lol."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Whitfield. I hate that it's in the Ace.

The hotel itself was clearly rushed to the finish with the construction trailers and dumpsters outside up until, and after, opening night.  With this, Whitfield is not separate space from Ace.  It's literally dumped right in the lobby with a shoddy trellis separating the bar/lounge from the dining seating. They do weird hotel stuff like make you wait until your reservation time to seat you at a table that has been empty since you arrived (actually happened; I almost lost my damn mind) and have almost obnoxiously friendly service. Luckily, the food is beyond all this surface annoyance.

Like.. The smoked chicken. I swear they dug into my dreams of dumplings and gravy and huge hunks of chicken to create this plate of new style comfort food. The +1 usually gets a burger but is most impressed with the french onion soup. Haven't tried it personally, but he's a pretty good indicator of what is popular.
Luckily for me, they have a French 75 on the cocktail menu as well as a few ciders on the list I had never even heard of.  The cocktail menu was mostly a whiskey in a rocks glass heavy selection but still impressive. 

With the worst thing about Whitfield being how crowded the lobby/bar is, I'd say it's pretty great. Make sure you have time to hang out; this is not quick service (not even in a negative way, enjoy yourself!).  The Ace brings a loud, out of town, older crowd making it an odd spot in Pittsburgh, but the dumplings are enough to ignore the over the top attempt to be hip with an odd placement."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this spot and it did not disappoint! Located in east liberty in the trendy Ace Hotel.  The restaurant is right off the lobby and has a vintage feel. The menu is creative and everything looked delicious, so it was hard to decide. My friend and I started with the holiday cosmo which was made with tart cranberry. We also shared the lamb tartare which was accomplished by mint and pea shoots. I decided on the rabbit paired with a glass of red. The rabbit was slow cooked to perfection with light gnocchi and sauce with olives and capers. My friend got the grass fed burger and we shared the Brussels sprouts. Everyone has fried Brussels, but these were some of the best I've had!  We ended with an olive oil chocolate cake which was light but delicious Our service was amazing and the food felt so fresh and such high quality. I cannot wait to go back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best meal and most positive experience I've had in a restaurant in Pittsburgh. From walking in the door without a reservation on my birthday and being greeted by lovely hosts, to Josh, my amiable server, and the coterie of great additional servers and bussers whose names I missed, the service was fantastic. Amiable and skilled, informative but not gratuitous. And smiling! 

The food was seriously on point. I ordered a number of small plates, sides and cocktails, not an entree. Each was tasty and well seasoned, served at the right temperature, and overall complemented each other. The overall menu was well thought out for texture and flavor balance as well. The cocktails were old favorites with a unique take, and I'll be dreaming about that mezcal one for a while (Last Stand?). 

Finally, as it was my birthday, they served my passion fruit dessert with a single candle. They didn't sing, but other patrons saw the candle and burst into song themselves. It was a truly lovely way to end my meal.

Again, the food was excellent and the servers really welcoming and lovely. I wish I could eat here all the time."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for a birthday dinner last Friday, and we were thoroughly impressed! The service was stellar - we were seated promptly (we had reservations, would recommend doing so for busy nights), and our waiter was super friendly, knowledgable, and attentive (without being overbearing!). Since it was our first time, he explained some menu items and answered all of our questions about the different ingredients and components of each dish. We also split a number of items, and he always had extra plates out to us without having to remind someone to bring them. 

The food was great too. We had beef tartare for an appetizer, and they also brought out a small plate of crostini topped with a bite of pork, apple, and celery leaf that the chef had made for us to try, just for fun! For entrees, we ordered a steak to split, as well as the duck dish. Both meats were prepared very well. We also really liked how the beef is all grass fed and locally sourced. Last was dessert, and WOW - this was the best part. I got a creme br√ªl√©e which was extra creamy and buttery. My mom had a strawberry basil panna cotta, which had the perfect balance because of the sweetness of the strawberry cream and the herby basil gel on top. My sister and dad split an AMAZING piece of chocolate cake topped by coffee frosting with crushed up hazelnuts. We all agreed that the cake was one of the best cakes we had ever tasted!

Overall, the atmosphere and food was awesome. While the meal was on the pricier side, we went there expecting it to be so and I think the food was worth it. The desserts were probably too expensive, but they were definitely large enough to split (especially the cake - all four of us could have split the cake). The actual venue was really cool too - the restaurant is located in the old YMCA building, now the Ace Hotel, and the combination of mid-century modern decor with the classical building architecture made for an intriguing but relaxing atmosphere. Our only complaint was that by the end of the evening, the space got a little dark and loud (the bar area is located on the other side of the room!).

A final comment - that night, the Ace Hotel was having Open Gym in the old gymnasium of the building. They had corn hole, ping pong, and board games set up in the gym, and it was open to the public for anyone to come hang out, eat/drink, etc. After our dinner, we went into the gym and played games. It was a really enjoyable way to end the night, enabled by the unique location. We all left feeling like we had a super fun evening!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch.  It was absolutely delicious!  The atmosphere is really cool since they are in the YMCA building and have kept all of the old charm.  The cocktails were great as well with a lot of variety, just ask for the other cocktail menus.  Finally, our service was excellent.  We had a really great experience and will go back to check out the bar."}
{"text":"Whitfield is inside the Ace Hotel, which opened less than a month before my visit. It's located in the rapidly gentrifying East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The food is very good and the service decent (a couple of improvements could be made), but I find the restaurant's greatest asset to be its space. If you like non-traditional, well-done, eclectic open multi-use spaces (as I do), you'll love Whitfield. The hotel is located in a beautiful old building that was originally a YMCA. The first floor is a quaint, yet mildly expansive giant room with high ceilings that is hotel lobby, restaurant and lounge all in one. The restaurant is partially separated by a grid-like wall that keeps things very \"open\" but rest of the space is a bar, cocktail lounge, sitting area and reception desk all neatly woven together with a myriad of seating options from bar stool to communal table to rocking chair to couch. I'd strongly recommend planning to enjoy a cocktail here before or after your meal. Between the volume of the soundtrack and the buzz of the young or otherwise not-so-young-but-still-hip crowd, the atmosphere is very lively and a most positive vibe, even if it's a bit loud.

The restaurant makes no apologies for being meat-centric,though there is a trout, chicken and vegetarian dish, the later two of which I sampled and I found them both excellent. There's also a lot of non-meat starters that have interesting combinations of ingredients. The French Onion Soup and the beet dish were definitely winners. Save room for dessert if you can, as the two that we sampled, including the Wigle Whiskey bread pudding were outstanding. While I'm not one to expect bread and butter with every meal, bread service would be a welcome addition given the menu of hearty comfort food. A nice artisan//rustic bread with a spread would be a perfect compliment, even if it were a menu item with a fee. The wine selection has a number of interesting options as does the choices of beer, which are local (all drafts are brewed within 10 miles of the hotel). I didn't explore the cocktails on this first visit, but suspect that they are imaginative and tasty.

Our server was knowledgeable, had a professional demeanor and was able to make some smart and thoughtful suggestions.I was a bit surprised at the rapid fire succession of the delivery of the entrees after finishing our starters. They could stand to slow things down a bit. Another disappointment was the complete lack of silverware replenishing. In a restaurant where the opening line is \"Sparking or still water tonight?\" the last thing that I find acceptable is to be having an employee say \"Do you want to keep your fork?\" as the entree is being delivered concurrently with the first course plates being cleared. Also, we were never asked if we were doing okay on drinks or if we needed anything else,"}
{"text":"Maybe dinner service just isn't the right way to do it at the Whitfield. Armed with 11 friends and a haphazard reservation, I stumbled in on a Sunday morning with hopes to cure my hangover and vanquish my previous judgment.

Brunch is dope at Whitfield.

The coffee was great, the service was spectacular, and the food was just as good as the decor. Our table got a little bit of everything, from donut holes to full breakfasts to salads to burgers, and each dish was just as unique as the one next to it. Everything is a little pricey, but I would love to come back with another large group and do it all over again."}
{"text":"Everyone enjoyed their food for the most part, however the service was less than acceptable. Our waiter's responses were rude, such as asking for lettuce on a chicken sandwich I got \"that doesn't come on that sandwich\" in a snobbish tone and I never actually got that lettuce I asked for."}
{"text":"$9 dollar mimosas made with cheap sparkling wine - $9 would be justified if the product was mid range. 

$21 dollars for bad steak and frozen fries 

When you think steak and eggs you don't picture a meal that seems like it was made from leftover dinner from the night before 

The server was great, staff was great, place was clean and a cool concept. This place is a little over rated, Highly priced. $95dollar brunch tab for two and $110 after tip. This is a one and done trip for us."}
{"text":"Such a fun spot for brunch with a large group. Restaurant is very simple but the wait staff is very attentive and provides top dining experience. Dishes are served on adorable, vintage inspired serveware. The cocktails are unique and so refreshing. Their coffee and espresso drinks are not to be overlooked. Very limited vegan options for brunch, but I was able to make a satisfying meal out of side orders including grilled escarole, fruit which was a caramelized grapefruit served with berries, and home fries. Everyone in my party loved their food, portions were large and service was fast. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great addition to the exploding east liberty food and beverage scene.we had brunch there twice in one week and both experiences were exceptional. Steak and eggs was perfectly done with steak at the right temp, the niciose trout salad was perfect.  Hipster servers and matching decor."}
{"text":"Great menu, mixed my order from bar and restaurant menus and am still craving more of the house made sausages (big and delicious) and that olive oil chocolate cake will haunt me.  Great service too, fun and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok--so I've gone back MULTIPLE times and they've totally redeemed themselves over the past year. 
Food- phenomenal 
Atmosphere- still trendy albeit a tad loud
Service- still a tad slow but as Clark Griswold says, \"It's all part of the experience, honey\""}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and I can not wait to go back! My husband had been here multiple times, but this was my first experience. I was excited to try the Mushroom Gravy and Biscuits, and it did not disappoint. The lightly dressed pea shoots paired well and elevated the mushroom flavor perfectly. The biscuits on their own were really delicious, and the texture was divine with the gravy.

As usual, we split and switched our meals about halfway through. The other item we ordered was the Chicken Sandwich which was yet another winner. Excellent breading, and perfectly seasoned. While I am not a fan of salt and vinegar chips these were actually enjoyable to eat. The vinegar flavor was much more mild and complimented the meal rather than detracting.

A surprisingly cute find in our city! Definitely worth seeking out."}
{"text":"I ordered the duck breast entree and olive oil chocolate cake for dessert, and both were excellent! The staff was very friendly and service was also excellent. However I thought the portion sizes on the appetizers (shrimp and oysters) were a tad small. I was also disappointed that side items were not included with the entrees. Everything was A' la carte and you had to pay extra."}
{"text":"I've been to Whitfield for both dinner and brunch and my impression was the same both times--just meh. The food was good, but not great. The service was fine, but not stellar. I think the restaurant is too pricey for what they're offering and wish they would be more willing to accommodate special requests (e.g. egg whites instead of eggs in an omelette). 

The location is the Ace Hotel is super cool and unique, but the restaurant seating is tight, so you're right up next to the table next you in many cases. It is also extremely loud. 

None of the food items I had on either occasion stood out to me as stellar, but the blueberry-lemon pancake was definitely good and unique (a sort of cross between a pancake and a donut). 

I would go back to Whitfield if someone else wanted to, but when it is my turn to pick a place, it definitely won't jump to the front of my mental queue."}
{"text":"The Whitfield is the perfect balance of elegance and personality. The menu is rock solid and the staff could not be more knowledgeable. 

If you're used to a Capitol Grille experience, this is the perfect change of pace. Meet causal fine dining where the staff members are the hippest-looking crew you've ever seen and everything from brunch to dinner to drinks to wine selection are all excellent. The pastry chef was nominated for a James Beard award so leave room for dessert! 

P.S it's less expensive to valet than it is to park in the garage."}
{"text":"A friend of the friend I was visiting wanted to brunch with us at this place, and I, like a good guest who did absolutely no research prior to visiting, moseyed on along with. Only learning as we approached that it was located in a hotel in a gentrifying neighborhood, I went in with little expectation of either goodness or terrible-osity.

This place serves way, way fancier food than I expected. The whole neighborhood has a middle upper class vibe about it, which explains both the interior of this place and the menu options. Now, this doesn't mean the place is snobbish--it's very beautiful and has a casual, Sunday-morning-brunch vibe about it. When the sun's out it's charmingly bright inside with all of the clean, white space and vibrant green. Really, I'd like my apartment to be redone in this style...if only I lived in a newer building! Alas, I will only have my memories of Whitfield.

So anyway, the friend of a friend recommended the Whitfield Breakfast. I, being on either day three or day four of the vacation, had mostly lost the ability to make decisions or care enough to have an opinion on what I'm eating, so I happily went along with her suggestion. (I am the laziest lazy when visiting people on vacation!) 

The Whitfield Breakfast was just what I wanted, anyway: poached eggs, English muffin, smoked pork, hollandaise, chimichurri, and a beet  & potato rosti. The flavors all went well together and yes, even the much-maligned-by-me beets tasted fantastic. It was a smaller portion than you'd find at a diner or less-fancy joint, but it was just enough to satisfy and was of such high quality I can't even complain a little bit.

Service was on point and very knowledgeable. My usual brunch mimosa was delicious, if a little smaller than I'm used to getting. The decor really made it for me, a bit retro but very clean and orderly. It appealed to my minimalist heart.

Truly a gem of a place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We have done two staycations at The Ace now and had a great time both times. 

As a vegan, there aren't a TONNE of options BUT the staff is friendly and will point them out for you. 

To add, you can do breakfast at the bar and they are very accommodating if you want to make up your own items like: avocado toast which isn't on the menu. 

Pancakes are good but contain egg - boo....it's like a lemon loaf in a pancake shape. 

Good coffee, good cocktails. Aren't those the spices of life? 

Great staff, pet friendly lounge, upbeat, modern & bustling."}
{"text":"Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday to me, haaapppy birthday to meeee, happy birthday to me. Ok, so in case you did not realize it I came here for my birthday. I left the choice of restaurant up to my partner and he did not disappoint. I would have never even thought to come here for dinner, much less go there because I didn't realize a restaurant was in the Ace Hotel. Crazy right?!?! I really went all out for this birthday night and I dressed up and was looking good so dinner here was a perfect end to the night. It was my first time in the Ace Hotel and I loved it. I loved the feel of it and how when you walked in it was such an open space that made you be able to breathe. It was not loud even though it was crowded and it was full of spirit and energy. I would come back here again, just for that, but the food was great so....

We were greeted warmly and seated right away. We went out on a Saturday so we made reservations and it was packed, so I am happy we did. Our server was great. I wish that I would have written down his name because he was amazing. He answered all of our questions, he suggested great drinks based upon things that I liked, and was just available if we needed anything without being overbearing. And he even went above and beyond for a little birthday treat, but I'll get to that later. 

Drink:
Meletti Collins: gin, meletti, lemon, grapefruit, tarragon, soda. This was a suggestion from the waiter and it was a good one. I like a good gin and tonic and he suggested that I spice it up and do something a little bit more. This was a really nice drink. Served in a slim tall glass. I sipped it throughout the night and it lasted through dinner. I wanted to save my money for the amazing food and that one drink was enough for me. I liked the taste and that it was fresh tasting. 

Appetizers:

Beet salad: mixed greens, preserved lemon, red onion, English cucumber, blue cheese croutons, honey vinaigrette. This was good but not large enough to warrant the $10 price tag. I thought as an appetizer it would have been big enough to share and I was mistaken. I ate it myself and I guess I could have shared, but it was just a bit larger than a house salad so I kept it to myself. The beets were not pickled, this is something that I was not expecting when I was eating it. I thought that it would be a pickled beet salad and was slightly disappointed to find only regular beets on the salad. I also could not tell the difference in regular croutons and if they would have had blue cheese in them. The salad was good, but I might just pick something different and less pricey for the next time. 

Butcher's Plate: A Chef 's selection of charcuterie, potted meats, pickles, mustard. Dang this was good. I mean it was $18 but still it was a hefty plate of meat. I would say that maybe next time not so much meat  before I ate my meat dish. The pickles weren't just pickles but green beans and some carrots. I liked them a lot. But I am a fan of pickles. The mustard was grain mustard and really tangy. Yum! I also would say that maybe a few more pieces of bread to go with the meat plate would have been nice. By the end we just had to eat straight slices of meat and that wasn't really cool. The tray did have a blend of a lot of the butcher's menu on it. I liked the hot shot the best (pickled cherry bomb peppers,aged provolone, capicola, EVOO) but there was only one and we just had to cut it down the middle. The potted meats were something that I have never tried before and...maybe will skip the next time around. While good, it was a little too much for me to eat. I will say that the duck liver mousse was my favorite. Weird, but still good. This was a lot of meat on a plate, so either come with more than two people or come with an appetite!

Dinner:
10 oz Tenderloin comes with two sides of your choosing Mac & Cheese with bacon bread crumbs & Braised Collard Greens. First, the steak was really, great. It was tender and cut almost without effort. It was flavored to perfection and also came with a side of a sauce, my partner picked the chimichurri. It was all over a great tasting meal, from the bites I took. The mac and cheese was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary or even that stellar, and the greens were ok too. But since it was not my meal I thought that with some changes to the sides this choice of tenderloin would have been great.  

Duck Breast: Duck Confit, Spaetzle, Honey Beets, pepitas, Sweet & Sour Cabbage. Ok, real talk. I kinda picked this because I was getting nervous about my choices and was just trying to make a choice. I probably would have really liked to do the vegetarian platter since the meat plate was a lot, but since it was my birthday I wanted something fun. I liked this dish a lot. I thought that the duck was done really well and was not tough or even greasy like duck has a tendency to be. The beets were sweet and the spaetzle really good. I would get it again, or just get the veggie dish."}
{"text":"Stopped in the bar area for to relax and grab a sandwich from the bar menu with a group.  It was crowded so we decided to head to the gym and grab a table there.  When we arrived at the bar there were 2 others waiting to order.  The bar staff ignored all of us for awhile.  Finally in a condescending tone the first person got to order.  Then the next person.  We had two people ordering separately, so we could split the bill and make it easier.  The bar staff took our order and said to come pick up our orders in 15 minutes.  Then as I was walking away they said, we will deliver your order and gave me a flag so the waitstaff would know who to deliver, nice touch.  When my order came it was missing one sandwich so we inquired with the waitress.  She said she would check.  Well, 10 minutes later we checked at the bar and that sandwich had never been ordered and the waitress did not let us know.  So we ordered and that person watched us eat and then we watched him eat.  Not sure how the order was missed or the follow up was not completed.  
It was fun on the gym area with families and people playing ping pong and corn hole.  
As to the food, it was very well prepared and very good.  From the burgers to the walleye fish to the chicken salad, everyone enjoyed their meal.  
When it was time to settle up at the bar they could not find our order even though they had taken the order and run my credit card on the order.  Finally one of the bar staff found the order but it is a little disconcerting to have them run you credit card thru the system and then not be able to find it in the system."}
{"text":"I went to the Whitfield with my husband based on the publicity in Zagat's Top Food Cities of 2015. Having been to many restaurants like this, I was underwhelmed. They have some service issues to work out (I'll cut them a break - they have been open less than a month) and that just comes with opening any restaurant. I get the sense they have a lot of staff working there because it's a hip new place in Pittsburgh, but they have little to no experience in the service industry. I had a hostess provide the following excuse to me as to why she did not take my drink order while my husband and I waited in the bar area: \"Sorry - I'm just really backed up - lighting candles, etc.\" What?! Not good. In regard to the food - mediocre. The most impressive thing we ate were the vegetable accompaniments - braised greens and kale and beet salad - which is pretty disappointing considering one of the chefs is a butcher by trade and we ordered the pork shank and Steak and fries. I will not be recommending the Whitfield to others."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to dine no matter which meal it is. High quality delicious food! My only complaint is I ordered the blueberry pancake. It was like a giant cake about 2 inches thick and as big as the plate. It was good but not what I expected."}
{"text":"What a pleasant and eclectic joy of a very hip and delicious restaurant! I had the Toad in a Hole with homemade bacon and grilled Escarole. My husband had the most amazing Blueberry pancake.  Can't wait for breakfast tomorrow! Staff is very chill and friendly. Atmosphere is on point as it is a reconditioned old YMCA."}
{"text":"I follow the James Beard award and I usually scout out the winners and nominations to find great places to eat.  When I was heading to PGH and saw that the Whitfield pastry chef, Casey Renee, was nominated... I knew I had to check out the menu.  When I saw they had a full vegetarian 3 course tasting menu, I was sold.

The Ace hotel was described as hipster and yeaaaah, it really is.  It's not pretentious hipster but still has that relaxed 'effortless cool and counter culture' vibe.  The restaurant is just off the lobby of the Ace Hotel.  Whitfield is quite open with lots of big windows letting in a lot of light.  It kept much of the dated retro vibe of the original YMCA.  Lots of old wood moldings and details you never see in renovated or new buildings today.  

Service here was polite, subtle, and thoughtful.  We had a few questions about the menu and every answer was genuinely helpful.  I ended up ordering the 3 course vegetarian tasting menu but I could have easily order my own 3 part dinner composed mostly of vegetables.  I loved how they offered a lot of vegetable choices without resorting to the typical pasta or brick tofu vegetarian dish.  We also got the pickled vegetables, smoked chicken with risotto, and an extra vegetable side of crispy brussels.

Before dinner started, we were given a delightful vegetarian amuse bouche and it was a baby radish with a nice smear of cream, sea salt, and light sprinkling of green onion.  Nice touch and start to the meal.

Pickled vegetables - a fairly large plate filled with 6 types of pickled vegetables.  A nice variety and flavour for each.  You have you gherkins, pickle slices, and beets but you also have carrots, beans, and also enoki mushrooms.  I liked the carrots and enoki the most.  4/5

Tomato salad - what a gorgeous plating... to simply call it tomato salad is to underestimate how it looks like spring on a plate.  Tomatos, cucumbers, crunchy bread crumbs, sprouts, and flowers... so simple to say but just stunning and delicious on the plate.  5/5

Smoked Chicken with Risotto - This dish is deceivingly light looking but its super rich because of the risotto.  Its incredibly smooth and creamy.  The chicken is nicely cooked with chantrelle mushrooms and roasted onions.  Overall, a very well executed and delicious dish.  4/5

Tempura squash blossom with polenta - The main entree to the vegetarian tasting was a nice dish of textural contrast.  Crispy edges of the tempura with the creamy chevre goat cheese tucked inside, creamy polenta just being cradling the roasted and tender squash, beans, and zucchini. The tomato butter adding a nice red colour from an otherwise yellow on yellow palette.  I really loved all the vegetables and ate them all.  The polenta was a lovely texture but I could have loved some more flavour to it whether it be some white pepper or another spice.  4/5

Crispy Brussel Sprouts - A super generous side of hot crispy sprouts.  They were like healthier versions of a deep fried side... crispy and indulgent for a green vegetable.  4/5

Banana Fudgesicle - So this was the sole reason for my first peak at Whitfield... chef Casey's dessert.  This is a vegan desert and it was quite a lovely dessert.  You had the nice crackly caramelized sugar on top of banana ice cream (which I can only imagine is really just frozen puree'd bananas), and a creamy thick ganache like chocolate.  You can really taste all the different components.  The chocolate puffed rice reminded me of a very adult and wonderful version of chocolate covered rice crispy treats.  A great end to the meal 5/5

It was one of the more expensive meals we had in PGH but the service and quality of food really put it as one of the betters meals too.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place or return once again if I find myself in PGH."}
{"text":"First time here but the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The food and drinks are amazing. I definitely plan to come back."}
{"text":"The decor and ambience of this restaurant allow for an enjoyable experience, with high ceilings, lots of greenery, and plenty of natural light. Tables are far apart from each other that groups may have their privacy, without feeling isolated. In addition, our server was friendly and attentive, rattling off all the specials while providing her two cents about personal menu favorites.

In regards to food, my main qualm with the Whitfield is that the menu is not very vegetarian or vegan friendly. For brunch, the three egg omelet is the only savory vegetarian entree option. This was was I ended up getting and didn't realize that there would be a bed of peppers and onions with a plain egg omelet on top, instead of the peppers/onions being mixed inside during preparation. However, this was made up for the donut holes we had at the beginning, served warm, and the mint chocolate cake we tried at the end, which also satisfied my sweet tooth."}
{"text":"As far as Pittsburgh restaurants go I'd recommend Whitfield for brunch.

I had the Whitfield breakfast and my boyfriend had the roast beef sandwich.

I really liked my breakfast. It comes with a hash brown that is made of beets which has a really nice flavour. The only thing I'd change would be to have a bit more food.
My boyfriend said the crust on the bread of the sandwich was quite hard so it made it difficult to eat. Also said taste was just ok.

Our server was great. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. 

We have also been to the bar in the evening. It has a good atmosphere, one of the better in the Shadyside area. There are a number of chairs and couches throughout. The only had one (or maybe two) servers for the entire area. That, coupled with the fact that there were only two or three bartenders made service quite slow. I'd return for sure, but I'd try to order from the bar instead of a server."}
{"text":"One of my fav brunch places in Pittsburgh. Amazing food, fair prices, and great, friendly staff. Love the environment- it's honestly a hipster haven and I am hands down all about that. 10/10 will be going again and again."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for dinner on 7/8/17 and we both agreed that it was the best meal we'd had since we moved to Pittsburgh around 2 years ago. Everything we had from the apps to entrees to dessert was prepared perfectly. Each dish had a great mix of flavors and textures. Truly the meal was a work of art. Special mention for chocolate cake we had for dessert. Hands down the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten. 

The service was also excellent. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu, including the wine. Everything was brought and taken in a timely fashion. Really from start to finish, everyone involved, this was one of the better dining experiences I've ever had. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Monday. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing with foliage surrounding the restaurant. It is located in the Ace Hotel. It was not busy as we did come for a late lunch. I had the Whitfield breakfast and my friend had the field Salad. Our food came out very quickly. The Whitfield Breakfast was two poached eggs, ham, english muffin, and hollandaise with some pesto and a side of beet and potato rosti. The english muffin was very dense, so the meal was quite filling. My friend enjoyed her field salad that came with chickpeas, tabouleh, and a tahini dressing. Overall, a cute place to grab lunch. Will definitely come back to try their desserts!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to have a special lunch date today so we decided to go here. I had made a reservation online and we were seated immediately.

They were still offering brunch which you could get 3 items at a prix fix of $26.00 or you could order off the brunch menu. We choose the latter. My husband ordered a Caesar salad and then you can add your choice of either shrimp, chicken, or beef for an up charge. I decided to go with their Whitfield burger which is a cheeseburger made with grass filled beef. It had a pepper sauce they put in it but I requested to leave it out because it would be too spicy for me.

In addition I ordered a cup of French onion soup. The sandwiches normally come with chips so if you want a side of French fries or coleslaw then you would pay extra for that.

I got my soup and was amazed to see the mozzarella cheese on a small piece of French baguette! The soup was a bit spicy but delicious! While we were waiting for our meal we were able to utilize the free Wi Fi that is in the lobby of the Ace Hotel.

We got our main courses and they were to die for! That burger was so thick and rich I couldn't finish my chips. I ordered my burger btw well done so there was just a hint of pink in it but that did not deter from the quality of the sandwich. I sampled some of my husband's chicken he ordered for his salad it is was melt in your mouth good!

We had prompt, professional, and friendly service which enhanced our visit.  The Whitfield restaurant is located just inside the newly opened Ace Hotel in East Liberty. Pay street or lot parking is available but when we parked the car we got an added bonus of free holiday parking!

This place is pricey but dress code is casual so you don't need to get dressed up. I would advise make reservations since the restaurant is small and will fill up quickly. This place is a welcome addition to our city and am looking forward to visiting it again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I truly love the vibe of this place. It is a little bit on the pricier side for Pittsburgh but their drinks (especially at happy hour) and brunch are on point! I highly suggest the Whitfield breakfast of homemade biscuits, ham, and poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. Absolutely delicious. The downside to this place is that service can be a bit on the slow side, as the servers are VERY busy."}
{"text":"My parents and I came to the Whitfield on a whim for brunch this past Sunday, and it was a very positive experience. We didn't have a reservation, but when we arrived we were told that we could sit anywhere we wanted in the Ace Hotel lobby and that a server would accommodate us. We sat down at a long wooden table in the lobby near the bar, and we were able to order as if we were sitting in the restaurant. I appreciated how accommodating the staff was for those of us who did not make reservations!

The whole vibe of the Ace Hotel is very cool, and I recommend visiting if you haven't yet. The owners have taken a historic building and updated it to make it very hip and modern. The Whitfield is separated from the Ace lobby just by some free-standing metal cage walls with plants cascading over them. The whole feel of the Whitfield and the Ace lobby is very airy and trendy. I could see coming here in the evening and hanging out at the bar for a drink, even if you're not staying in the hotel.

We decided on the Grand Prix for lunch, which included a starter, a main brunch entr√©e, and a choice of either a bloody mary or a mimosa. The mimosas, in all honesty, were sub-par. They were very small and tasted like they barely had any orange juice in them at all. The starters, on the other hand, were extremely impressive. There were 3 different starters to choose from, so we each chose a different one to share. We had the bruleed grapefruit pomegranate, the potato soup, and the house-made donuts. I honestly could not choose a favorite! The potato soup was extremely smooth and unlike any potato soup I have ever had before. It had some smoked kale on the top that added the perfect crunchy accent. The donuts were crispy and sugary on the outside, and soft on the inside. They tasted faintly of almonds and had some kind of sauce on the inside that was to die for. The bruleed grapefruit pomegranate was the real surprise for me, as I never would have ordered this usually but ended up being absolutely obsessed with it. The bruleed top of the grapefruit made it so sweet and delicious. It was also topped with fresh blueberries and pomegranate seeds. Very tasty and very impressive overall!

We all chose the same entr√©e - The Whitfield Breakfast. This includes English muffins layered with poached eggs, roasted pork, and a hollandaise sauce. The flavors were intense and the dish was quite tasty, but I have to say that I could have done with about half of the hollandaise sauce. The entr√©e was absolutely drenched in the sauce, and I was only able to finish half of it because it was just too heavy. Honestly, the sauce was delicious but unfortunately completely overpowered all the other flavors since there was just so much of it. If I ever ordered this dish again, I would ask for the hollandaise sauce on the side. A bit of a disappointment on that front. On the side was a potato hash brown that looked very scary and spider-like but was surprisingly extremely delicious. It was salty, but not overpowering. I believe it was infused with beets which added quite a depth of flavor.

Overall, I think we all enjoyed the starters more than the entr√©e itself, but I would love to come back and try another dish. The chef is obviously very talented and has innovative ideas. Looking forward to another brunch visit soon!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Whitfield was on a Monday night--late--so we figured it would be slow we had been meaning to go so . . . We walked in to the Ace Hotel Lobby and were delighted to discover a really amazing lobby and bar full of young people and a DJ performing at a tolerable volume--enough to keep it interesting but not stifle conversation.   

Went to the Whitfield area and were seated for dinner.  Server came up immediately and ran through the menu with us.  We split an appetizer and ordered two main courses.  I got the duck, which was excellent.  My wife ordered the Trout--home run.  

I found the food to be well-seasoned and prepared to perfection.  My duck was perfectly done and had a nice, smooth taste to it.  Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch a few weeks ago. We had made a reservation but I think we would have been fine without. The restaurant is located right in the lobby, and feels very spacious and cheery. I had the Whitfield breakfast, which was eggs Benedict with a tasty beet and potato hash brown. My eggs were cooked perfectly and I really liked the chimichurri sauce they put on top! I do think their menu is a bit limited and overpriced ($12 for a standard eggs, toast, and bacon breakfast). Still, I would return for brunch or to try out their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"We've been here three times and always for brunch. I swear we keep saying we need to get back for lunch or dinner but never make it. With that said, the brunch is really nice. I'm a huge fan of the wedge salad and pastrami hash. In fact my boyfriend and I split them before sharing a plate of eggs (usually scrambled) with sausage and toast. The plate also comes with homefries. I think the sausage is homemade. Once we had bacon instead of sausage, also good."}
{"text":"The ambience here is lovely: it's in the lobby area so it's very open and well-lit. This is not the place for a cozy intimate candlelit affair, but it's perfect for brunch! I came here for brunch with a group of 6 people, and we had no trouble making a reservation a few days in advance. 

We started with the matcha donut holes, which were delicious! Then, I had the biscuit + mushroom gravy as my entree. The biscuits and gravy were both quite good, but I found the meal not particularly satisfying. Biscuits just didn't feel like a complete meal to me, and next time I would order something else

One friend ordered the fried chicken salad, which was really quite the salad, complete with French fries! It was a pleasantly unusual dish, but not the best option if you're looking for something healthy. Another friend ordered the trout salad, which came with a mysteriously pink egg! Very cool

Overall good food, good ambience, and very pleasant staff. I would definitely go back and try some other dishes"}
{"text":"The Ace Hotel and accompanying Whitfield are a welcome addition to 'SLiberty, even if you aren't a hipster. You pay for retro yet elegant/minimalist ambiance, fresh ingredients and careful attention to detail. The blueberry buttermilk pancake + sweet lemon cr√®me fra√Æche is thick and delicious, though its sheer thickness makes it vulnerable to being served underdone. For the savory taste buds, go with the seldom seen pastrami hash or classic three egg omelet, but if you're hungry consider adding a side as the portion sizes are somewhat lacking IMHO. Service this time around was meh...I can't remember the last time a server made my party of three feel guilty for drinking a normal amount of coffee. Put Whitfield on your list and take it for your own test drive. If you don't want to grub, then check the Ace Hotel's event calendar for a refreshing list of happenings throughout the year."}
{"text":"J and I came here for breakfast this morning. We've been meaning to try this place out for a while, and were pretty happy that our morning plans were cancelled allowing us to come. We got there about 10am and were seated immediately. The atmosphere is so warm and inviting. The decor is very simple, yet had an upscale feeling to it. We reminisced about how the site used to be the old Y, and how some of the same touches were still there. All of the staff were very friendly. J ordered coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast. I had mint tea, the 3 egg omelet with cheddar, mushrooms, and tomatoes ( I substituted out the onions and peppers) which came with a side salad, and an English muffin. Everything was so delicious and filling! A few gripes: way too much cheddar cheese in my omelet, however I spread it on my English muffin so that worked out, and the coffee cup handle was a bit small and only allowed for one finger. However those are insignificant, as the pros more than made up for it. Definitely recommending this place for breakfast, as we will most likely be returning!"}
{"text":"What a cool atmosphere this place has. The ace hotel is super trendy with a hipster, laid back vibe. The Whitfield dining area is small but cool with different miss matched tables and chairs and decor. The menu wasn't huge but it was enough to choose from. Everything we ordered in our group was quite tasty, but I'd say it is a little expensive. 

The one thing I did not appreciate was that we made a reservation for 2:45pm, and brunch ends at 3pm. So when we were seated, the first thing our waitress came over and said was that their kitchen closes promptly at 3pm and no more food will be made after that so we need to rush to get our order in in time. Why would you allow 2:45pm reservations if your kitchen closes so promptly and people will feel rushed from the start? 

Other than that, our service was fine and everything was brought in a timely manner. I look forward to going back and hanging out in the bar area for a drink. It looks like an inviting atmosphere for grabbing a stump town coffee or a cocktail either day or night."}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch this weekend.   Interesting fare, though wish there were a few more \"breakfast\"  options.   The atmosphere is great and the interior doesn't feel like a typical hotel restaurant.   Will be going back for dinner sometime to see if it holds up and how the environment is with the open bar/lobby."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend for her Birthday dinner on January 9th. It was raining and we were excited for dinner in a new warm space. There had been a private event earlier and our reservation was at 8:30. We were seated immediately and ordered a cocktail. This is when things went wrong. It took about 25 minutes for our drinks to arrive and our waiter came by twice for our dinner order before we had a sip. The waiter knew the special was rabbit but did not know what cut. We had to ask him after he came back again, and he must have guessed because he told us leg, but came back and said tenderloin. I ordered the rainbow trout and my girlfriend ordered the filet. My fish was white? And we sent her filet back twice to get it cooked medium. A disappointing meal, and we will not be adding this restaurant to our list of recommendations."}
