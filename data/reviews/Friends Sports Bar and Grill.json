{"text":"Greasy bar food.  Stale bitter air -- even when first opening.  Ridiculously over-worked waitstaff.  The Sports were broadcast over the PA, but only half of the TVs were showing that channel, and they almost all were obscured by some damage to the screen.  Avoid it if at all possible."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but nothing really to get excited about. Bar menu is great though. We actually really like going for bingo on Thursday nights, but it is WAY too crowded. Last week we ended up leaving because there were no tables and no where for my dad (who just had ankle surgery) to sit. Kinda disappointed, but made our way down the road to Johnny B's."}
{"text":"First, you need to ignore any review before 2010 because the restuarant wasn't open before then...those reviews were for a prior owner and prior name of the place (bentley's...now friends).  Those of you from Belmont know this places changes hands and names almost yearly.  I suspect that trend will change.  The new owners tore out all the carpeting and actually got rid of the bar smell.  It smell clean.  The food was great for bar food...which is what the joint is.  Sports on tv and bar food with a few bar games.  We bring our family there during the day and the kids like it.  HIghly recommend the fried pickles....much better then Sammys....scarry, I know."}
{"text":"Since the change of new owners, this place is GREAT again! The atmosphere is better...and it looks cleaner. The food is amazing...especially the spinach artichoke dip. I have to get it each time I go! Try the Friendly Fries with your meal. They're yummy too!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are a Football Lover!!  They have every game on Sundays, and it's not over crowded."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and drinks... the atmosphere was \"cozy.\" I had the Buffalo burger with friendly fries (pub chips), burger wasn't the best, but the pub chips were some of the best that I've had. For a Tuesday night, there were quite a few people there. Our waitress was pleasant, but slow. I would come here again for the drinks."}
{"text":"This was a good place at one time not sure what happen manager change or what. The waitress was the worst I ever seen was very short when spoke to and rude.The drink ordered was wrong and not mixed well... even the food was mediocre... sure hope this was just a bad day and not the norm"}
{"text":"Pretty good food! Pretty good prices. You just have to put up with really loud (bad) music, obnoxiously drunk rednecks, teenagers hogging the pool table, hit-or-miss wait service, and packs of cops doing walk-throughs. Also, not a whole lot of seating, if you don't count the bar - which I don't - so get there early. Parking is pretty bad because of all the bars and restaurants in such a small area...BUT at least Friends has a back entrance so you don't have to walk around."}
{"text":"Great place!!  Very friendly owners and staff. Patio is a great place to hang during good weather. Food is great and the chicken nachos rock **Please note**. Any reviews before Aug 2010 refer to the place having a different name and different owners."}
{"text":"Formerly Stars Comedy Club, Bentley's Bar & Grill is not to be confused with Bentley's on 27 in downtown Charlotte.  Bentley's Bar & Grill is a sports bar in downtown Belmont NC with a flair for running out of burgers or just about anything else at 9pm on Saturdays.  Yes the manager comp'ed our meal.  But our waitress was completely indifferent and service overall was terrible.  It still took half an hour to get a few beers and cokes to our table.  She refilled water once every two hours and everyone in our group was eating dinner.    But I don't blame our waitress.  All of the problems that night were indicative of the management's inability to pay attention to the basic details of running a restaurant.  Don't make me beg for food and drink.  You're the ones that put the sign on the door that says \"Open for business\"."}
{"text":"We Go here often, one of the better bars around, had a steak the other night and WOW... I could not believe how good it was, other than my own haha it was the best steak I have had.patio is nice if you can find a seat"}
{"text":"Walking by and noticed their specials board on the sidewalk. Went in for the $2 bottled beer and chicken club with onion rings. Nicely prepared, nice presentation and great flavors. Giant TVs for your favorite sporting event , definitely a \"will return\" kind of place!"}
{"text":"SCIENCE!  Trivia is on Tuesdays at 8pm.  Guess the only times I've been to Friends?  Tuesdays at 8pm.  George from Team Trivia hosts a well attended, difficult trivia night that awards prizes to Friends for the top 3 teams.    There is a decent selection of beer & your typical bar food plus the awesome potato smiles.  Their daily specials on beer are sweet."}
{"text":"First time there and service was slow, even at 6 pm.  Not many were there.  We left and came back a little later and one of the people we were with was cut off because he was \"stumbling\" but our friend was fine. Maybe if your floors were a little even, he wouldn't have stumbled.  He's not a regular, therefore doesn't know your issues.  I'm not even a regular and tripped on your floors, twice! We let the issue with your \"security\" guard, Chris, go.  Our friend went to the bar to get me a beer and was denied.  Again, he was fine.  I actually saw many folks for real stumbling and were actually drunk but yet they were freely getting beer from the bar.  Not to mention, before we left, the same guy followed my husband in the bathroom and watched him!  He said something to him and the \"security\" guy walked out.  Ridiculous! Our group was extremely upset and immediately cashed out.  Took almost 15 minutes to even leave because it took that long!  Then my husband was chest bumped, purposely, by someone who knew the \"security\" guard as we left.  Words were exchanged, Needless to say, it didn't get far..... We won't be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is not the worst place I have ever been but its pretty close.  My mother and I went there for lunch and she order The  shrimp  basket  the shrimp was not peeled and yes it was fried wirh the peeling attached. Very sickening. I ordered pattie melt with fries, if i would have threw that burger pattie it would of broken to a million pieces.  It was burnt to a crisp, my soda was flat. The kitchen staff looked as if they had scabies. I bet their  sweat was all over the food they was preparing.  I wish I would have seen them befor I ordered my food. The bathroom was  disgusting. I would not  recommend this place to anyone but the health dept!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I tried this restaurant before for lunch but was not happy with the food but I was looking for a place to rent for two events I have coming up and heard about the function room upstairs that they have so I went to look at it and while there we had lunch.  Everyone was happy with the food the owner was very friendly and the waitress was efficient and friendly.  I rented the space upstairs its a great space with much to offer."}
{"text":"It was quite a chore for me to convince my wife to come back to this location despite my insisting that it was a new joint. The last time we were in there, it was a smokey, dingy feeling place called Bentleys. This trip was much better. The inside felt cleaner and more inviting. We opted to sit out back where there was corn hole being played and a television on the wall. It appears the sun would be on the patio earlier in the day rather than later.   It was 50 cent wing day, so i got 10 hot wings with a side of the extra hot one (insane or inferno?). They were good wings, the hot was an enjoyable hot giving just a slight runny nose.   The winner of the night and the sure reason we'll be back were the Friendly Fries. They were perfect little french fry circles that were actually kind of addicting. On the way home, i was already craving them, maybe just because i didn't get an order of my own.    We had great service and will be back, might even bring some friends with us."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. I'm very impressed! I decided to get a Reuben and Fries, and Fried Pickles for an appetizer. For the price point, the food is extremely worth it. Most of the food averages around 8$."}
{"text":"I still give this place 3 stars, but after eating lunch here & hanging out on the patio, it's more of a high 3 than a low 3. The food is actually really good, don't judge by the look and/or smell of the place when you walk in. I had a burger my 1st lunch visit, & was skeptical about paying around $8 for a burger from a bar. But wow, add me into the completely surprised category, this burger was huge & not a frozen patty. Pretty sure they make their own burgers & it shows. My 2nd lunch visit I had a Buffalo Chicken wrap & it too shocked me with how good it was. It didn't reach the burger's level, but still intrigued me to eat here more often. Finally, the best side item I've had are the fried green beans; why have I never had these before? They blew me away as well.  So other than for some reason everyone staring at my friends & I when we enter, the food will shock you & you can have a pretty good time out in their patio area (even though no one seems to hang out there).  The bar area still has a distinct smell (get rid of the carpet) & the atmosphere is still a little lacking, but Bentley's is starting to grow on me for a lunch or dinner visit."}
{"text":"Jessica is the best waitress! She's always happy and friendly. The best prompt service and refills all done with the warmest of attitudes. We are always a pleased with her. Bartenders aren't consistent as far as we can tell with drink orders. I believe Brenda is my favorite (I think that's her name). Tonight we were there and a dj was there for part of our stay. Loved the dj. 90's to current mix of everything."}
{"text":"Probably the dirtiest restaurant that is really a bar I have ever seen. It would be like opening up a restaurant in the men's bathroom of Charlotte Motor Speed way during race week. The whole place is dirty (even your feet stick to the floor) in no way would I ever eat here."}
{"text":"this is the best dive bar in belmont in my opinion, there's a good beer selection and pretty good bar food too"}
{"text":"Tired of Interstate Driving,  stop here for a burger and milkshake.   Good burgers that a priced reasonably.  Make sure to check out, what type of special burgers they are making that day.  I didn't see the chalkboard and missed out on trying some neat combos.      Also get a milkshake, they make them good here."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and usually the food is great.  I would recommend the nachos, burgers or the club sandwich. I did try the philly cheese steak and it wasnt very good.  They ways have different drink specials and the staff is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Been going here since it was Bentley's. Couple of months ago was my last time going to friends. The bouncers there break the law on the regular. They have family that frequents the place on the weekends and if you look at them wrong you will be thrown out, choked out, or beaten. It's a trashy bar with trashy people. The owner needs to hurry up and sell the place so a new owner can clean house and get rid of the riff raff"}
