{"text":"The place has new owners as of Nov 2016 and the food has gone down the toilet. Used to be super good, now its awful. Avoid this place now.  Sorry to see such good food become uneatable!"}
{"text":"Food was God awful. Picked up beef with tomato and beef brisket. They were both disgusting I threw them out after one bite of each dish. I can't believe they sell food here, they really shouldn't."}
{"text":"We used to order from Fai's all the time and then something changed, not sure if they have new owners or what but the last 3 times we have ordered delivery it has been tasteless, not accurate and overall disappointing. So many better places out there. This place isnt worth returning to. 
PS. The person answering the phone should understand basic English. Frustrating!!"}
{"text":"I have never in my life returned food to a takeout restaurant, until tonight. Food was delivered and completely inedible. If I have ordered Chinese food 500+ times in my life, this is the one time and one place that I have ever asked for my money back. I drove the food back and suddenly felt like I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. Just awful."}
