{"text":"Funny I thought I wrote a review, but i guess i forgot. Long story short, this place has some of the best tables in the area by far. If your serious about pool, this place is a must visit. The prices are perfect for anyone to come down and enjoy a few games. Did not try the food, only drinks. But again, the tables are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is the shit, good food, good beer, plenty of pool tables. Music is good. I world go anywhere else for pool"}
{"text":"Great place to shoot pool,  the place including the bathrooms is clean. Food is good for the price. I've had the wings,  burger and fries,  chicken parm sandwich with side salad and everything was good for a reasonable price. Brian the manager is in touch and aware of what's going on, the staff is very nice. Only thing  negative is that they have a large turnover with their servers that will hopefully stabilize. definitely recommend this place to anyone. ..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kolbys for the past 25 years... Still the same great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"There are not many places you can feel comfortable with a teenager. Kolbys is the exception. Great place to hang out with family and enjoy a cold one (nice selection) and  grab a bite.  friendly service, clean and tables are in great condition .  Good selection of house cues and a great variety of tunes all for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great place for pool and off track betting.  Lots a fun"}
{"text":"This place is really affordable and the epitome of \"chill\". They have plenty of pool tables, a few arcade games, lots of TVs (showing pool right now, prob sports events when one is on?). $2.25 all day on bud and bud light drafts. Some awesome lounge couches and guest WiFi. Perfect place to pregame before heading to a D'Backs/Suns game. Lightrail stop is close by so no need to drink & drive."}
{"text":"I like this place its great for families cost $10 per hour up to 4 people can play. The kids can stay until 10pm"}
{"text":"Awesome place to kick back and shoot some pool!  Big mugs of beer are $5 and the food's not bad.  The bathrooms actually have paper towels as opposed to the annoying electric hand dryers.  I'm a fan"}
{"text":"Very cool place, a real pool hall.  Many of the patrons there are excellent players who really care about the game. Good food, reasonable prices, nice equipment.  You can't lose, really."}
{"text":"Cool spot to chill and play pool at. They allow kids until 10pm. It's only $9 an hour for a table for four people. It's a calm and relaxing environment. We didn't try their food but I will make sure i do next time. We will be coming back soon. Lot's of tables and good music playing."}
{"text":"Top notch is Right!!! We have searched everywhere.. Phoenix, cottonwood, Sedona, flagstaff, Prescott, and in between just for a well kept & serviced pool table and NEVER thought all we'd find were coin arcade tables and ancient tables that had not been touched in years or decades. It's not hard to call a serviceman to upkeep pool tables that make you so much money. THIS place understands that. Excellent tables, TONS of them, great friendly staff, yummy food until late, great coffee, great music, excellent fun atmosphere. It does NOT feel like a bar because it's so much more. THANK YOU for creating this place!!!!!! Pro pool players will love this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out, relax and have a few beers. Customer service is awesome. Always a good time at Kolby's! :)"}
{"text":"Great poolroom. Good staff and some of the best food you will find in a poolroom. If you are looking for fun with friends or cheap action gambling with someone then this is your place. You can ask the counter person if you are interested in playing a good player and they will find someone for you to spar with. Gets really packed on Friday and Saturday nights, beer is fairly priced. Juke box for music, TVs throughout, free dart boards. They have hourly tables and quarter tables too. I have been going there for around 8 years, never trouble there, a great place to bring your date or family."}
{"text":"\"What can I say about Kolby's that isn't amazing?\"  I ask myself this everytime I think about driving 20 minutes to play pool here. Alas, it still remains unanswered... This place is awesome. Simply put.  You don't have to enjoy pool to have a good time thats FOR SURE.  They sell brewski's and eats. No liquor (I just found out), but their amazing food will make up for that dinger.  I swear, any food I eat here is fantastic.    Fireball Burger is indeed VERY fiery... like the waitresses! Loaded Fries are soooo comfortably loaded like many of the patrons Supreme Nachos come with everything including a side of siracha (sp?) and sour cream. Don't. Underestimate them... Tacos are flour tortillas, but deep fried like corn ones... They are extremely tasty and you get three of them.  Believe me, they are thicker than your grandma. Seriously. :|  Sun and Mon have $1.00 pints. THAT'S RIGHT! ONE DOLLAR! Tues have $2.00 Coronas  The staff is B-A, Bad Ass! Everyone is super cool and they make you wish you were them. Honestly! I want to work there!  Anyway, if you are in the mood for some chillaxing, stop here. Noon to 7 only costs you $7.00! Can you believe it?!?!?! That's unheard of!"}
{"text":"This is an old place yes, but it`s so good it could stay that long in business! Owner is a great guy, Staff is very friendly, good service good food for the price. We hang out at least twice a week there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"local businesses like this are the scourge of Tempe. No concept of anything resembling service. Dirty. Inedible cardboard food. On it's way out."}
{"text":"I waited a while for a table and gave up. It really wasn't the right scene for those of us not into the hip hop music and over the age of 20.  I walked in and the waitress girl was having a rough night and didn't even acknowledge me.   It's probably cool for a young college kid?  Onward I shall travel...."}
{"text":"I love this place! The day shift cook is amazing! His food is delicious! I play darts on Wednesday nights in a league that Kolbys is sponsering. They always have some type of leagues coming in to play whether it be foor pool or darts. They also have pool tournaments that you can win cash from. I think their pricing for drinks are very reasonable being that its located near ASU."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the side of a strip mall, next door to a karaoke joint, is Kolby's. It is of good size and has nice tables. The establishment itself isn't too bad. The service is a completely different story. After having a have full beer removed with empty glasses, we figured it wouldn't be an issue to get it replaced. Wrong. The waitress \"swore to god\" the drink was empty. Being completely sober myself and seeing the beer just before it was taken away, I tried to assure her we weren't scamming her. No dice. This was a matter of principal and not dollars and the resolution was simple and painless. Instead we left, as a group, talking smack amongst ourselves about the whole incident. All over a $3 beer. Silly."}
{"text":"There's a lot to love about Kolby's. I've been here three or four times. All late at night. I have a problem with sleeping early so when I can't really nod off to sleep at a normal time, I grab a friend and I come play pool here.   I don't fancy myself a great pool player, but that doesn't detract from the place at all. I'll usually be here with a friend, kicking back a beer or two playing pool late at night. It's a comfortable place and not loud like some places are.   The food here is middle-of-the-road. I've had the Supreme Fries, not my favorite but I will spend hours munching down some of their waffle fries. Their beer selection is not large but it's a fairly decent selection. I usually get the Landshark, but they seem to always have a special on PBR so my buddy ends up getting that.   For two people, it costs about $8 to play for the hour, which I don't personally think is a steep price to pay when nothing else is open at 3 am. I'm at a loss for what to say next. All I can say is I like Kolby's and I'm definitely coming back, if not on a weekly basis then more often.  I should also note: after 10pm you need ID to show you're over 18."}
{"text":"This is a great pool hall to catch up with friends with a pitcher of beer. They have a lot of tables and it isn't very crowded or loud so it's very comfortable and relaxing. It's nice to get away from the craziness of Cue Club and just chill when I feel like shooting some pool. Came here on a random weekday (stopped in after seeing it on Yelp) to play some pool with my people and ended up staying a lot longer than anticipated. We were just having fun playing pool, drinking beer and working the jukebox. The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonably cheap in my opinion. After reading some of the reviews about the food I am definitely going to come back and try it!"}
{"text":"I pay to play in a tournament and then when I win the raffle (a free month of pool) I don't get the option to do with it what I please. I can't sell it and I live far away and the gas I would spend doesn't cover the greens fee I would have paid. So no one gets a free month of pool.....So dumb. Who puts stipulations on a raffle. Absolutely rediculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Great floor manager, good service. House of Scott Frost the pro pool player. Awesome quality pool tables. FAST 9' tables. So many one pocket players..."}
{"text":"While on a mini \"vaca\" I discovered that I rather enjoyed the focus and concentration of pool, having never tried before (there was a table in the lobby of our hotel) afterwards I was determined to find some place where I could hone my new interest and searched some places and found Kirby's!! It was another yelp review that mentioned that kids were allowed until 10pm (as my 13 year old became a fan as well) and we gave Kirby's a try. Our first time in a pool hall and the staff were very accommodating and attentive. We had a fabulous experience learning and even had dinner there, the wings and fries were great! We have set a goal to become regulars"}
