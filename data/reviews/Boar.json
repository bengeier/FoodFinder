{"text":"I had one of the best veal sandwiches I've had in the city. The size is very generous and they have solid topping selections."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, grilled chicken or steak with pesto/mushrooms/cheese is my favorite. Much better than Black Camel. The service is great too."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches. I got the sausage with arugula pesto (which was mayo-based with walnut and arugula). It was well done and the bread was homemade, not store bought bread. Definitely a good sandwiches shop to stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"Finally! These guys know how to take a simply product and create awesome sandwiches. Been twice now both times the food was great, service was friendly. Try anything they offer because its all cooked with a lot of care. I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"A great place to stop by and get a good and quick bite. The veal sandwich was impressive and generous in size for its price. You can get creative with toppings for your sandwich too!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place by looking for a lunch place while in the area and based on its previous reviews. I'm typically not a sandwich guy and usually not a fan of veal sandwiches. Usually they are soggy mess... But wow! The veal sandwich I had here with a lemon aioli  sauce with aragula was excellent. Very fresh bread, nice and crispy and with the sauce and aragula made it very fresh! If you're like me, I don't think this would disappoint."}
{"text":"Owners of Black Camel should have stuck to what they know best- slow roasted sandwiches.  Boar serves up just ok italian sandwiches.  I had the veal sandwich. The sauce is too tangy and not balanced."}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem. I was passing by and decided to stop in to see their menu. I love how you can customize your sandwich. You pick your protein, the sauce and your toppings. I got the veal with the tomato sauce with arugula and hot pepper. It was very tasty- the veal was amazing. I'm pretty sure it was made to order because it didn't taste like the veal was fried and was sitting out. They placed the whole hot pepper in the sandwich. I would have preferred if they had chopped it up. My boyfriend was hesitant with the mayo pesto sauce and the lady was kind enough to give us a taste. The service was excellent and the restaurant itself gives you a minimalist feel. I will definitely be going back to try other combinations."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches with real meat inside! Quite a heavy meal for lunch... but once in a while I indulge :)"}
{"text":"I would go back. Get all arugula.....maybe cause I like arugula but it doesn't matter just get all arugula"}
{"text":"OMG! Soooo good.  Got the grilled chicken sandwich with arugula pesto and peppers.  My daughter got the veal sandwich that I had a bite of and it was divine! The roast potatoes are awesome. I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse that I can walk there in less than 5 minutes lol"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop. Simple selection, but all incredibly good. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty damn excellent, and if you're feeling piggy the remarkable Falasca pizza is right there just around the corner as well... oink oink, yes I have done the combo.  Boar has Italian-style sandwiches and having tried many, they seem all good. The charcoal-y grilled marinated chicken thigh stands out for its tenderness. It's almost verging on under-done in its juicy succulence (not really though, merely proper technique) so note this if you prefer a more 'done' meat.  Very good at what it does, Boar still leaves me partial to Black Camel's more deli-style approach that uses roasted meats. I just don't eat \"breaded this / sausage that / portobello the other\" all the time, and I like my protein simple. But good on them for offering some new choice with cutlets, the excellent grilling, and toppings that include arugula, fresh housemade sauces and good cheese options.  Friendly staff and not much seating. But you were just going to chow that Italian Sammie on the walk along Yonge, right... maybe getting a little pizza-by-weight for dessert on the way past Falasca?"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sandwich places I've been to. The place is small, and the menu is rather simplistic, but it doesn't matter to me. You pretty much just choose your meat, the sauce, condiments, and that's it. In terms of pricing, it;'s $10 for a steak sandwich with one topping, which is reasonable in my opinion. It's one of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever had. The staff is really friendly, and if they didn't charge $1 for each topping, I would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The chicken with arugula pesto, sweet red peppers, mushrooms and arugula is amazing!!! The only reason I did not give it the full 5 is that some of the chicken was burnt or had charcoal and that created a bitter taste which did not work with the other flavours. Overall though it was awesome! The pesto makes it!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the city. The customer service is amazing they are the nicest people ever. Always super consistent as well. Make sure you try the veal sandwhich!"}
{"text":"UberEats: Very good veal sandwiches. Bun might be a little big and some of the toppings (caramelized onions, extra mustard/tomato sauce etc.) shouldn't be extras, but otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich place, good value for the money. Simple menu, but they have it perfected.  Not a big fan of the way they do the chicken, I would recommend sticking to the beef. The meatball sandwich is really delicious and very filling."}
{"text":"Recently came back and tried the veal. It's was awful. California sandwiches this wasn't. The cut was fatty and very difficult to chew. Considering their track record, I'll be back again and will update. It may have been just a poor cut of veal."}
{"text":"Used to treck down to Black Camel at lunch when I was craving a delicious sandwich and had time to spare - with Boar opening a block away from my office its amazing sandwiches any time I want!  I hope you find someone else to start making the Noce du Leche again!"}
{"text":"This place has some good sandwiches but a bit too pricey for me.   I had the veal sandwich and it was great but I wish it would come with just one topping like my favourite sandwich place, California Sandwiches. On the board it says extra toppings...but how could it be extra if you haven't received the original topping???  Do try it."}
{"text":"Simple but excellent sandwich menu with ability to customize exactly what you want. Perhaps the best veal sandwich I've ever had. I can't wait to try more combos."}
{"text":"Just as awesome as The Black Camel.  Had the sausage sandwich with caramelized onions and the aioli sauce, sooooo yummy. I had just finished an 8 km run so I was still hungry and I then ordered the Veal Sandwich with tomato sauce and mozzarella, Delicious!  I love this place.  Go Now."}
{"text":"The boar was divine, the seasoning was outstanding....burger on chibetta bun was a great use of an under used bread...(in my opinion)  The atmosphere is light and friendly and the wait staff literally run to give you your food if you are waiting for any length of time.   When you have 4 cheese choices (additional cost) you can't lose #winning"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty sandwiches up in here!  Disappointingly, they were solid out of a couple of the main sandwiches we wanted to try by around 7pm when we made our order, but we still got to try: Sausage Sandwich Meatball Sandwich Roasted Potatoes   The sausage was the clear winner of the sandwiches. Thick chunks of sausage stacked up in between the bun was quite pleasing. The meatball was kind of generic but non-offensive.  The roasted potatoes were actually really good though. I was impressed how they were slightly crispy and well seasoned, and despite the travel time held their own as much as the sandwiches.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich place. Limited but delicious menu. The steak sandwich was perfect. The staff is great and very friendly."}
{"text":"It must be nice to rival yourself for best sandwich in Toronto :)  Boar is not Black Camel two but if you asked me to choose between the two I'd definitely have to think about it.   If I had to differentiate, I'd say Boar focuses on grilled BBQ, and Black Camel on southern bbq or slow cooked, smoked BBQ.   Both delicious and both with amazing sauce & topping selections.   I had the grilled chicken sandwich, a boneless, skinless chicken thigh, grilled to perfection, complete with smokey grill mark flavour. The mushrooms and and mayo were both delicious as well.   I will be returning to try the rest of the menu for sure."}
{"text":"Had the meatball sandwich with added peppers, onions, and provolone cheese.  It was absolutely delicious and the price was on point.  Would highly recommend this sandwich joint to everyone if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place probably doesn't get the love it should because its on a side street. The vibe is casual and friendly. The menu is simple and to the point.  The sandwiches are great, the prices are reasonable, and the portion size is huge!   I really liked the roasted potatoes (not too salty, not too greasy, both crispy and potatoe-y). I got the meatball w/tomato sauce (mild) ($7) w/ arugula (+$0.90), caramelized onions (+$0.90) and buffalo mozzarella (+ $2.50). My partner had the sausage ($7) w/ tomato sauce (hot) plus provolone (+$0.90), Caramelized Onions (+$0.90) and roasted red peppers (+$0.90) and he loved it.The bun absorbed the sauce but was still firm on the outside. The meat was juicy. The perfect amount of sauce. A little messy but delicious! The order was made fresh and in a timely manner.   We took our food to go, but enjoyed the rustic charm and no fuss atmosphere of the place. I liked that they had a lot of seating for a small place. The staff made helpful suggestions and were very caring and patient. The staff worked together as a team to deliver our food.   I would go back and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Most incredible veal sandwich! I have been coming here for 3 years and always have a big, hearty lunch. It's a small little tucked away sandwich shop, but I find the business level is always steady due to their really good reputation in the area. The kitchen staff are very friendly too!  For those who go with the veal sandwich, the best toppings to go with it are mayonnaise and their caramelized onions! Soooo delicious!"}
{"text":"This is Boar, hear me roar Just sandwiches, juicy delicious Tasty grilled meats, feelin the heat Sausages and meatballs, firm buns, nom nom nom Small hidden concrete place, folks were totally great But they masters of the upsell Bloody hell Flavourful condiments like tomato sauce, BBQ and lemon garlic aioli, oh makes your mouth sing But you want cheese or chili peppers on that? Of course you do! Ding ding ding It was pricey to begin with before wallet screamed hurry hard Minimal ingredients, guess it's back to Sully's on Gerrard  {TTC: closest would be Davisville subway station, with a short walk north on Yonge until you hit Glebe, where it's tucked away beside the Lil Baci place I wrote about a while back.}"}
{"text":"Food was tasty but portion size too small for the price. $25 for 2 burger sized sandwiches."}
{"text":"Found out this is the same owner as the black camel. Not exactly the same but has the same excellent friendly service with their staff members and same environment small but quaint. I ordered the steak with mushroom,argula, lemon aioli and cheese. I found it tasty but not extremely difficult to eat due to the chewiness of the steak and all the juices and sauce from the rest of the toppings but I still enjoyed it. Will go back to try their chicken next. The price is a little higher than what I would like but with the fresh ingredients I can see why they charge what they do."}
{"text":"Simple.  Delicious. Easy.   Great place for a quick lunch and delicious simple ingredients.  Lotsa room to sit down and enjoy some great sandwiches.    Had the veal with tomato and buffalo mozzarella and it was out of this world.  We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.    Majorly impressed!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today...It's a small little sandwich shop tucked away near Yonge and Davisville.  It is very unpretentious and has a simple menu.  They have 5 main sandwiches: - Veal - Meatball - Chicken - Sausage - Portobello Mushroom  In addition you can specify additional sauces, and toppings but they come at an additional price.  I ended up getting the portobello sandwich which came with arugula, garlic aioli and roasted tomatoes and it was absolutely delicious.  The bread that they use is sweet and fluffy without being overly soft.  I like my bread to have a bit of \"fight\" in them.  My colleagues had the other types of sandwiches and they all had good things to say about the taste and quality.  I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the sandwich was pretty good. Standard stuff. The bread was fluffy and soft and tasty.   But a sandwich (veal, pesto, tomato sauce, hot peppers and cheese) and a pop cost me over $15. Which, in complete truth, is overpriced--especially compared to the other options in the area."}
{"text":"We tried this place on move-in day, so we were starving. Husband mentioned that it's the same owners as Black Camel. Quick question: why wouldn't you name this Black Camel now that you've built a great brand?   Anyway, it was pretty good, but I can't remember what I had (that's how hungry and tired we were). We live up the road, so we'll definitely go back and add another review."}
{"text":"I last visited Boar shortly after they opened and found myself underwhelmed by their veal sandwich. Don't get me wrong; it was a solid 'wich. I just wasn't blown away by it.  Now that I live in the area, I figured the time was right to give Boar another shot. (It helps that I was intensely craving a meatball sandwich after seeing one being prepared on a Food Network show.)  I showed up around 11:30 and the joint was empty, so I quickly ordered and took a seat. A few minutes later, my hefty-looking sandwich was presented to me and I got started on that bad boy.  It's phenomenal. The hearty bread is pretty much perfect (although I have to admit that the bottom basically evaporated into nothing as I ate). The meatballs are substantial and flavorful, while the spicy tomato sauce is a perfect accompaniment. I also had the sandwich topped with caramelized onions and roasted hot banana peppers, with the former giving the 'wich a nice tang and the latter... Well, honestly, I couldn't really detect the latter. I did, however, notice that there was a thin layer of prosciutto contained within the sandwich. It was a delicious surprise.  I'll be honest and say I really can't remember when I've eaten a tastier meatball sandwich, so it's clear that Boar has completely ironed out whatever issues it was having at the beginning."}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwiches.  Usually get the chicken, and the salads are tasty too.  Only thing keeping this from a 5-star review is the price which is on the high side for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Service was fast and the sandwiches were very very hearty. I sort of wish there was a grilled and a breaded option for the chicken, as I like a good ole chicken parmesan sandwich dripping with tomato sauce. But the grilled chicken was super moist so I let it slide. I'll definitely go back to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have had the veal and chicken with the recommended sauces and they are good next will try the meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"Boar is a hidden gem in the neighbourhood. I was first tipped off about this place because I'm a patron of Black Camel, it's sister shop by Rosedale station. The sandwiches are excellent, and differ qualitatively in the way they are cooked (Boar tends to grill meat while Black Camel is pulled) while the selection of condiments is very similar (Dijon, BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, etc.) My only gripe is the price, hence three stars, but it's definitely worth the price if you're looking for one the city's best sandwiches."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how delicious these sandwiches are! Ive been here at least 5 times over the past couple weeks. Simple menu with your base sandwich (chicken or veal are insane), sauce (arugula pesto), then toppings. On the side, their roast potatoes are so solid. Seasoning is perfect, just enough crispy edges.   I generally have a large appetite and the portion size was just fine for me (generally a concern for me at lots of Toronto restaurants). Absolutely recommended!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich. My order was wrong but that's fine, we got more than what we asked. I really liked the veal and chicken. Arugala sauce was very good!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are good, but there a bit greasy and heavy. Recently I have noticed that the sandwiches have gotten a bit smaller compared to when they first opened.   The garlic Aoli gives this place a unique edge over similar sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Not easy to spot because it is just off Yonge and the name \"Boar\" is not written anywhere -- just a picture of a boar's head and the word \"Sandwiches\". I had the steak sandwich with arugula pesto sauce, Crimini mushrooms and sweet peppers. DELICIOUS blend of flavours! Someone else coming out told me that the Portobello sandwich with lemon aioli is the best sandwich in Toronto. I'll be back soon to try is out :P HIGHLY RECOMMENDED :)"}
{"text":"Deeelicious Sandwich. I cant remember what it was called but it had meatballs in it and cheese. Really yummy.   The girl behind the counter is a joker.  Funny and Nice!"}
{"text":"This tiny little sandwich shop is divine. It's tucked in off of Yonge street. They have an amazing veal sandwich, an amazing steak sandwich, and some nice little sides. They have a few tables for sitting but I've always done take out."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to California Sandwiches.  THE FOOD: their version of hot peppers is sriracha sauce, steak was dry and veal was \"OK\", bun was a let down and \"buffalo mozzarella\" was a sliver of cheese hidden somewhere in the sandwich.  THE SERVICE: placed an order over the phone for 5 sandwiches (3 veal, 1 chicken, 1 meatball) and 2 sides of potatoes.  When I arrived to pick up order I was told they were sold out of chicken, meatballs and the potatoes.  Why they let me place an order and not tell me they did not have the food I wanted until I arrived is beyond me?  I ended up leaving with 4 veal and 1 steak sandwich and no sides.  Maybe I caught this place on an off night?"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled and think that Boar only offers pork options!  They have chicken, beef, pork and veggie options.  Pick your meat (or veggies) and your toppings to make your own sandwich, done.    The decor is a bit lacking, concrete everything.  Kind of makes you feel like you're in an unfinished basement, or jail cell.  But the smells of barbeque made everything all better.  I chose chicken topped with tomato sauce and arugula.  The hubby got steak (I don't see steak as an option on their website, but I'm pretty sure he didn't order the veal) topped with arugula aioli and mushrooms.  We had to wait around 10 minutes for the sandwiches to be prepared, a sign the meat is only cooked after you order.  The bun was like a ciabatta bun, so it was crispy on the outside, and slightly chewy on the inside, which I loved.  The meats were grilled really well, had good char, and juicy on the inside.  I liked the beef over the chicken, just by a slight margin.  We also got a side order of the roasted potatoes.  They were AMAZING!  Super crispy on the outside and super soft and fluffy on the inside.  The only downside was that the portion size was a bit small for the price we paid."}
{"text":"A solid Italian sandwich option in Davisville. The interior is cave-like but I usually take out or eat on the small patio out front. Get the veal, it's significantly better than the other options (second place chicken)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I ordered a veal sandwich and a sausage sandwich to share. It's hard to pick which one was my favourite. The sausage had a subtle smokey taste to it which led me to crave another bite. The veal was moist and delicious!  They make everything in house from what I gathered from the delightful man working behind the counter, so you can just imagine how good the tomato sauce was!  We talked to him a bit while he was taking our order and helping us choose what toppings to put on our sandwiches, so it came up that it was our first time there. When he was packing up our order he gave us a free salad because he said that we needed to try it. It consisted of arugula, baby tomatoes, and a homemade honey and dijon dressing. Very simple but full of flavour. I would highly recommend Boar to any sandwich loving human! Delicious food and fantastic service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Black Camel and decided to try Boar today. Boar is located just a little off Yonge St. between Eglinton and Davisville stations. it can be easy to miss but they have a huge sandwich banner in front as well as tables if the weather is good.  The sandwiches are filling and delicious as you would expect. I had the chicken sandwich with arugula pesto and roasted sweet red peppers. Great combination of flavours. Chicken was moist and juicy and the arugula pesto sauce complemented the chicken really well. The bun was not too soft and the perfect size. Overall, loved the food; would come back for more if I'm around Eglinton and Davisville."}
