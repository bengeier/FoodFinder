{"text":"First time trying this resto and it was exactly what you would hope for.  Nothing fancy. Not trendy.  Just old style salty rich goodness.   Ordered pepperoni pie - got happiness in a box. Warm salty rich beat the winter cold happiness.  From the bottom up - Crust : thick rich dough that was crispy and cooked through without being chewy ... but not too thick. Sauce : clean tasting tomato sauce that had warm fennel finish in the tongue. Not acidic in the least. Cheese : plenty on it without being greasy.  Pepperoni : thin shreds that generously papered the top. The button : pleasant surprise that the nob which keeps the lid from sticking to the pie was as fresh and light as the crust (some places seem to use the dough that would be tossed)   All in all this is old school pizza at its best. Cash only. even the box was refreshingly simple.  No marketing on it. Just a white box.   Fries were not as good but then fries don't always survive a delivery. They were not horrible either.   Solid value in a world of trendy pizzas and the latest greatest thing.   Will be calling back again soon. Maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"Pendellis is childhood in a box!! Old school pizza, gooey cheese, perfect pizza crust and a dough in the middle! Their other takeout food is perfect comfort food!!"}
{"text":"Greek run pizzeria. You call and pretend John Belushi is on the other end when he says 'Pendelisss' with a heavy Greek accent. Warning, the pepperoni is extremely salty and will possibly make you blind before you reach to drink that two litres of whatever liquid you should have bought before hand. Tough luck if you didn't buy anything to drink because plain old water won't do the trick. Oh and sign your Will before eating as it's probably the fattiest pizza in town. BOOYAH!"}
{"text":"We actually drive across the Mercier Bridge for this pizza. The place isn't pretty and it isn't even trendy but the pizza makes you forget all that as soon as you take your first bite. Thick and full of fresh toppings, hot out of the pizza oven. Yes, you might have to wait a while occasionally but all time fades as you sit there with the scent of heavenly pizza wafting from the oven."}
{"text":"Pendelis is still run by the ever-entertaining Theo who serves up some serious pizza in this town. Everything is hand-made (the pizza and poutine sauces, the dough and the tzaziki all are made on site) and all the ingredients are top-notch quality. And you have to admit, they're pretty heavy-handed with toppings.  (Woe to the poor soul foolhardy enough to ask for 'extra cheese'... It's like a 1/4\" thick in that scenario). The only downside is the vegetarian pizza-- easily remedied by asking for an all-dressed (without pepperoni) and olives, instead."}
{"text":"If you want a pepperoni pizza in NDG, this is the place. They use thick STRIPS of pepperoni, not the paper-thin slices of almost-bologna that now permeate the Montreal pizza landscape.   I've also had the Pendeli's Special, which is terrific as well.   FYI, Van Horne Pizza in Outremont also uses the same type of pepperoni, and is almost as good. The sauce and crust at Pendeli's is better though."}
{"text":"This is serious pizza. Super thick and tasty crust, loaded with big, quality toppings. It's a damn satisfying experience. And the pepperoni is truly awesome.    Easily one of the best (if not best) delivery pizza places in the city."}
{"text":"I had the 'all dressed' or whatever its called, the standard one. It was average, base was too doughy and the tomatoe sauce they use is a bit on the tangy side. My girlfriend had the vegetarian and it was not great, canned asparagus should never take a lead role on a pizza.  Not great value either, the buy one get one half price displayed on the window only covers medium and larger so for a couple of medium pizzas you are looking at almost $25 including taxes.   I would have given them three starts but the service was joyless and I generally have pretty low standards when it comes to service.   I can see why people like this place if they compare it to the dominos just down the road, but Pinolis Pizza on Monkland dominates this place, its cheaper (genuine two for one on the regular menu for eat in) and better and the service is slightly more friendly."}
{"text":"I love their souvlakis.  Pizza is also good. Service is great!  Always have take-outs there."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pizza and decided to try something new and I'm pretty happy that I did. After googling pizza delivery NDG I was directed to quite a few Yelp reviews re Pendeli's.  I dialed the number and a big, gruff, deep voice answered the phone, don't know why but it took me by surprise!  I ordered a pepperoni pizza and it arrived about 30 minutes later, bubbling hot and smelling rather tasty:)  The reviews I read were very accurate. Delicious pepperoni, salty and abundant, nothing like the paper thin bologna type that most places use. The bread is on the heavy side but was good with a little butter,  the sauce was also tasty and there was plenty of cheese so no need to order extra.  All in all, very good, I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"A Montreal institution and a great example of Montreal style pizza... Or at least what was Montreal style pizza in 1982."}
{"text":"I used to go to this hole-in-the-wall with my Dad back when I was in high school. And HE used to go there when he was in College. If you like peperoni Pizza this is the best place in town. They lay on the peperoni thick, slicing it in a signature lengthwise style... If you're looking for tasty, greasy and filling old school Montreal pizza, this is the place."}
{"text":"A classic. Pepperoni and mushroom is my go to pie from here, always consistent and never a let down."}
{"text":"Great pizza that's done in that old-school \"Greek style\". I usually go for pepperoni because I feel that simple is best. Their sauce has a hint of fennel seed, which really adds to the handmade quality of it.  They do pretty well on other items, I also regularly order chicken souvlaki pita, Greek salad, or a club sandwich. However, if I was going to order one item I'd pick the pizza - that's what they're known for and that's what they're best at."}
{"text":"This isn't facny pants 900 degree Neapolitan pizza (which I love), this is junk food pizza Montreal style and it's damn good, I wish they would use better mozzarella though.   I still long for Miss Decarie from the 90s but Pendellis will do, get your grease on. For those complaining about the service, get over it what do you expect from a bunch of old timer Greeks working all day in that heat. LOL"}
{"text":"Bad food ! 2 hours to deliver ! The only reason we ever go there or order is for the hot chicken sandwich and the last time they screwed that up ! Subs and pizza are not what they were years ago . They must have sold it or stop caring . Very sad ."}
{"text":"Going to Pendeli's for the first time was a total fluke...my boyfriend and I were hungry, the fridge was empty and we were not in the mood to go to the grocery store and cook something ourselves so we set out to find a restaurant. Without even knowing what we felt like eating, we drove around NDG. My Yelp app told me about this pizzeria, and suddenly, pizza was the only thing on our minds. We quickly drove there and once we stepped in, we knew...this was going to be epic. You can generally tell the quality of a pizzeria based on their pizza cooking technique (conveyor belt oven vs actual pizza oven) My boyfriend was happy to see an authentic pizza oven! Then we watched their assembly of the pizzas...HOLY PEPPERONI BATMAN!!! Instead of slicing down to form circles, the pepperoni is cut lengthways to create long strips of awesomeness! And the bacon! OMG the BACON...actual strips of bacon instead of rolled up pieces of chewy nastiness that occurs on most of the pizzas around... The ingredients are super fresh...we always get the Pendeli's special without anchovies or olives/vegetarian without olives. The only way they could make their pizza better is by making chicken a topping choice...(we would add it to the veggie) We tried the fries and the sub one time...both don't live up to their pizza. PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA... So good... You must eat here."}
{"text":"This is the pizza that I grew up with as my parents live in the area. Its more than 50yo so you know its got a loyal fan base. It has a medium thick crust with lots of cheese on top of the toppings except for the pepperoni which they put last. Imho this was the type of pizza that I loved until I moved out of the city and started trying out NY style pizza and pizzas made by Italians (which there are still many in TO) and then my standards changed.  But it's still a great pizza when I am in the mood for Montreal style pizza."}
{"text":"Pendeli's Pizzeria on Cote Saint Luc Road without a doubt serves one of the best pizza pies I have sampled in Montreal. I grew up in Montreal and more specifically N.D.G. during an era where mom and pop style pizzerias were commonplace. Such places as Golden Moon, Bonora, Kent, Pompeii's and Vesuvio's among others, dotted the landscape. All have long since closed and Pendeli's Pizzeria remains, in business since 1958. I have been coming here for years.  I was in the area recently and stopped in to order a small pepperoni, well done, to go. The wait was not very long, approximately 15 minutes. During the waiting period I listened to the owner and delivery men talk about how the price of food was skyrocketing and began to wonder if this would be reflected in the price of my pizza (it was not). I paid $10.25 plus tax for my pizza. Cheap compared to some other competitors places (B&M comes to mind, way overpriced).  The pizza was excellent. Pendeli's serves their pizzas with long triangular slices of pepperoni, piled on thick and placed on top with the cheese underneath. I like this style. The dough is excellent thick crust, crisp and fresh. Carrying the box out of the Pizzeria I noticed the weight of the pizza as compared to other pizza joints. It is quite heavy! All in all, I would rate Pendeli's as one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. It doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Well,  the pizza was ok.   The sauce is really missing that extra seasoning,  very bland taste. The dough was good ( get it well done ),  the cheese was cheap and straight out of the plastic bag already grated.The pepperoni was good,  they cut it length wise. To be honest,  its a step above the fast food pizza joints,  thats about it.  The guy on the phone seems to be in a terrible mood when you call all the time. reminds me of the guy from \"Do the right thing\".   On the MoeFactor scale,  61/2 on 10"}
{"text":"Greasy, gross, and amazing. It's true Montreal pizza and essentially my go-to for delivery. Cheep for a group. They're super rude on the phone but I don't care if the pizza's good. They tend to overload the pepperoni, which can be good or bad depending on your opinion. Ordering on friday night will always give you varying results as they're busy. At the end of the day, good pizza."}
{"text":"It s a very dirty restaurant,the owner leaves his shoes under the eating tables,  I don t know about their pizza, but the souvlaki tastes like raw chicken disgusting  I won t eat there anymore unless it is inspected by government"}
{"text":"My man's mom used to hang out here in high school and this is the pizza he grew up on, which I think in part explains his awesomeness. If I had grown up on this pizza I'd be cooler. The pepperoni is fat strips of cured beef on top of the cheese like yo, this is how we do it and your insides can just weep and deal with it. We had friends over and ordered this pizza and it sent them home to bed with their heads spinning. Not for the faint of heart, but truly excellent for what it is."}
{"text":"30-40 mins for delivery during lunch hour. My coworkers order their pizza rather often. I grabbed a burger ($3.75) and a small poutine ($5) to satisfy my fast food craving. Burger was good, nothing special but considering the price and it being on delivery I was happy with it. Poutine was on the smaller end but had the right amount of cheese and gravy. Overall; hits all the check marks but doesn't leaving me asking \"why hadn't I ordered from here sooner!\" They get a thumbs up for being a place that delivers above $8 when everyone else is only above $15"}
{"text":"Cool Pizza! Very fast delivery. Prices are not the best, some menu items a little more expensive then the usual pizza 2 for one pizza places."}
{"text":"This is an NDG institution. It has been serving great pizza for longer than I have been around and will hopefully continue to do so long after I am gone!   The best way I can describe Pendeli's is the perfect mix between fancy expensive pizza and cheap crappy 2 for 1 pizza places. It is the king of reasonably priced delivery pizza.   The menu isn't complicated at all, there are the classics and that is it. No truffle oil or fancy cheeses here, just classic pizzas done perfectly.   What really makes Pendeli's stand out in my opinion is their sauce and bread. A great pizza needs both and Pendeli's doesn't disappoint.   Order the Pendeli's special if you love meat, it is amazing !  They also make a great Pineapple Pizza! YES I LOVE PINAPPLE PIZZA!"}
{"text":"I cant complain too much about the pizza. It's pretty good if you like greasy pies and i definitely do. But i can, and will, definitely complain about the service. Every time I've eaten there I've been disgusted by the attitude of the personnel and how slowly i was served. So much so that I decided to order in even though i was only 1km away.   After an hour and a half i called them back to ask what the status was. The guy who answered was extremely rude so while i was trying to be polite i got fed up and started to say that if it was more than another 15 minutes we'd send the driver back, but as soon as i said, if it's more than, he cut me off and said \"your loss\" and hung up on me.   Trying to be as fair as possible I'd rate the pizza as 3.5 on 5. Price 3 on 5 cause it's fairly pricey for what it is and service 0 on 5.   Ps it wasn't winter or raining out."}
{"text":"Wanted to order pizza in NDG today, and my favorite Al Dente was closed, so looked on help and after seeing the good reviews, ordered an all dressed large.  It was really good and rich. Heavy pizza. Tons of cheese and meats and everything, it's also thick pizza. Usually I don't like thick pizza, but this one was really good. It's definitely heavy hangover food though, not light oven cooked pizzas like Al Dente.  Food also came pretty fast. Like 30min."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pizza the other day, and Risa D.'s review was the clincher.  I've got to say, this was the best pepperoni pizza I've ever had. The pepperoni they use is nothing like the pepperoni I've seen on other pepperoni pizzas. Yes, I am trying to say the word pepperoni as many times as possible in the one review.  I also tried their mushroom pizza, and I was pretty good - keeping in mind that I absolutely LOVE mushroom pizzas, and have a very high bar when it comes to a pile of fungus on a pizza.  There's no fancy thin-crust pizza here, but it's not some crappy/floury crust either. I would say it was pretty much the perfect thick-crust pizza - thick but still tasty, and not a chore to eat.  The only thing I wasn't in love with was the tomato sauce they used - It tasted great, there just wasn't enough of it! That being said, I'm putting it down to a one-off thing and will definitively go back there again to eat."}
{"text":"This is true Montreal style pizza. Nice thick layer of cheese and lots of toppings ! reasonable prices and quick delivery. One suggestion though ask for the pizza well done !"}
{"text":"Pendelli's is with out a doubt the best true pizzeria pizza!! I lived close to this pizzeria   growing up and every weekend was a Pendelli weekend! 10 star pizza!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizza in Montreal.  Old School pizza with the pepperoni sliced lenghtwise and placed on top.  As the pizza cooks, it causes the pepperoni to crisp and release its flavors....  This place is an institution for pizza, never fails to satisfy even the most discerning critics....   Look forward to my next visit...."}
