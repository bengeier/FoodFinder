{"text":"I'm glad others had positive experiences here because, as a vegan, I want to see veg-based businesses succeed, but I will not be returning here again and will tell my friends and family to do the same.  I discovered this place from a veg facebook group and looked up their website.  I dined here about a week ago at 2:35pm, which according to their website was \"tea time\" (2:30pm-5pm) and was priced at $9.88 (down from their regular lunch price of $12.88).  We were greeted by the owner at the door and told that tea time was not a buffet, but rather a \"set meal\" predetermined by the chefs.  This was a few days after they opened and their website made no such mention of this (the website now reflects this change).  Disappointed, but wanting to support a veg restaurant, we stayed.  I asked the owner if it was a set meal, did that mean they could not accommodate vegans?  She said she would talk to the chef to have them accommodate me.  A waitress then seated us.    Feeling a bit uncomfortable about the set menu as we were quite hungry, I walked up to the buffet to see if there were many items left (the buffet ended at 2:30pm).  It was definitely after 2:30pm but I saw a woman go up to the buffet for seconds (I assume she had started eating before 2:30pm).  About 50% of the items were still available so I asked the waitress if we could pay the regular lunch price and just eat whatever was leftover from the buffet.  In essence, we would pay more to eat less.  The waitress said no and cited the reason that \"the staff needed to eat and would be eating the leftovers.  the chefs to not cook new food for themselves and there are 8 staff members to feed.\"  I was taken aback and could not believe this answer!  I tried politely asking a few more times, even saying I was willing to pay more to eat only half the buffet items, but was again denied.  The tea time \"set menu\" was brought to us (see photo) and of course we were sorely disappointed.  The waitress told us that the set menu changes every day due to what's available to the chefs.  In my honest opinion, I believe it's just what's leftover from the buffet as I saw every one of those items in the buffet line!    The owner came by to check on us and my dining partner asked her why we could not eat from the buffet.  Her answer (surprisingly!) was different.  Her reason was \"health codes due to the timing of the food being left out.  And it was a strict rule that they had to cut off at 2:30pm.\"  This was obviously untrue since she did not stop the woman from taking seconds at the buffet a few minutes earlier.  Shortly after receiving our pitiful \"set meal\", the 8 staff members march out and proceed to demolish what is left of the buffet.  Even taking up tables around us and eating their overfilled plates.  Very unprofessional, in my opinion.  This whole experience upset me for several reasons: 1)  no apology for the incorrect website information, just simply a \"oh yeah, we have to fix that\" from the owner. 2)  the obvious lie from the owner about health codes when there are still people taking food from the buffet after 2:30pm 3)  prioritizing \"staff meals\" over paying customers!  This point is what really leaves me irate.  I was only a party of two and obviously would not eat so much as to leave the staff \"hungry\".  if this is truly the reason we could not partake in the buffet, I will not support a business that has these practices. 4)  the utterly dreadful and dismal vegan tea time \"set menu\" that cost us TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS 5)  nothing noted in menus that there is a 12% gratuity charge automatically added AFTER TAXES which only added insult to injury  I don't know if the owner is veg herself, but after the interaction, service, and experience of this restaurant, I am very inclined to believe that this place isn't rooted in a lot of the principles of vegetarianism/veganism such as empathy and compassion for all living beings, but rather only a commercial endeavour that can conveniently bill itself as \"the first vegetarian buffet in Toronto\".  As upset as I was and still am about the experience and basically throwing $25 away, in all fairness, the few morsels of food in the set menu were good which makes me feel better about giving 1 star."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars  Not bad for the price, $12.99 for lunch, seniors get 15% off.  Pay at the front before eating.   There are hot food, salads, noodle bar, dessert, fruits, fried varieties and soup.  Seating in the middle section is a bit too tight, but the booths on the side look more spacious.  I think the lunch noodle bar would have more variety such as different types of greens, vermicelli noodles, frozen tofu, etc.  The tomato and laksa broth were both pretty good."}
{"text":"This new Vegetarian Restaurant opened not too long ago.  We love the selection but be careful some dishes have eggs.  Even without those dishes there are plenty of selection and the food is good quality and tasty.  I definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"I had a great experience, seated quickly and food was great. Not sure why the other reviewers had such a terrible experience because I really enjoyed mine! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"We came here to check this place out after reading about it on Facebook. I was so glad that I did so.  I came in for lunch. Place was packed, the cooks were busy, and fresh batches kept coming out. Food includes dumplings, sushi, sweet & sour chicken and pork (mock of course), hotpot, curry, soups... and so much more. Most items are vegan and are labeled so. It has been a while since the last time I piled up my plate at a buffet! There is also a Build-A-Noodle station which is an interesting concept and surely worth checking out. Everything was delicious especially the hotpot and the curry.  Place is spacious. Buffet is on the first floor. 2nd floor is fancier. There are private dinning rooms at the basement. Service is amazing. Owner is extremely friendly and accommodating. Tap water is self serve.  $12.88 is a bargain! Few are complaining about the whole paying upfront situation. Not me! Yes it's different than what most restaurants do, but honestly I find it super convenient as I was free to leave whenever I was done rather than having to wait for a waiter to bring the bill then later the credit card machine... you know the drill. More restaurants should start charging upfront! Less headache for both customers and waiters.  Overall one of my favorite dinning experiences.I'm surely coming back.  P.S. Cherrie and I planned an Unofficial Yelp Event at Blossom Vegetarian on Thursday July 12th, 2018 at 7pm. Everyone is invited!

{"text":"This place was great!! As a vegetarian it's such a treat to be able to go to a buffet and not have to worry about what you can and can't eat.   We visited as a group of 4 on a Friday evening and the place was quite busy but we were seated right away. The manager was very friendly, informed us about the 12% service charge before paying and also asked if anyone in our group was vegan as not all dishes may be vegan friendly.   The food was great, with a large variety of mock meats and a make your own noodle bar with choice of either miso or curry soup base.   We found that the service was great. Immediately after being seated we were asked about drinks. The water is self serve however they had a server coming around to refill our glasses. They were also very quick about clearing plates from the table. The manager also came by during our meal to check in on us, which was nice.   The only suggestion for improvement we had was in terms of dessert selection. We found it to be a little lacking. There was a mango pur√©e, a strawberry chia ?pudding, and some fruits but more selection would be great.   Overall a positive experience and I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This new vegetarian restuarant opened in the Richlane mall replacing the dim sum restaurant. I came here on Tuesday at 12:00 pm and it was semi packed. We came in a party of 2 and were greeted by friendly staff. We had to pay before entering and afterwards they tape the recipt on your table indicating that you paid. Lunch is from 11:30-2:30 for $12.88 per person. They include the a 12% service charge after taxes. So for two I believe it was a total of $32 something with everything included.   When seated we were offered either cold water or hot water. Any other beverages include an extra charge.   In terms of food, they had a bit of everything from dim sum, to french fries, to stir fry, sushi and soup. I tried the bbq pork bun, lotus wrapped glutinous rice, and fried red bean dumpling from their dim sum portion. The dim sum sat there for a while so it wasnt hot and the bun and rice was a little dry. The taste is mediocore, definitely doesnt compare to wu tai vegetarian where the dim sum comes out steaming hot. However the people beside me got the food afterwards fresh and they said it was good!   They had two soups, spicy and sour and an asian soup. Both were ok. The stir fry noodles with fake ham were bomb! Loved that one. Even the fake beef rice noodle was also very good, it honestly tasted just like the real thing. They had an abundance of vegetables as well. They also had curry chicken and beef brisket with turnip. The turnip can be softer. The curry chicken was yummy! Their sushi was suprisingly good. The rice was good and the fake salmon was good as well.  They have a noodle section near the entrance which I didnt try. Their dessert portion consisted of some fruits and jello. They do have hot chinese soup desserts.  They will bring out new things so keep an eye out and get it while it is still hot and fresh.  Staff were super friendly and very attentitive. Some foods were better than other but its a cool place to try if youre vegetarian."}
{"text":"The food was great. The only complaints I have are the following:  1. nobody gave us a chance to order anything from the drink menu, or even explained how it works. If you pay up front, do you also have to order drinks at that time? Or do you pay as you go for drinks? None of the servers said anything about the drink menu. We ended up just getting the filtered tap water, the restaurant lost some sales there for sure.  2. one of the guys watching the buffet also seems to be watching the customers. He told my wife her plate was too full and that she should use another plate. But I saw plenty of other people with plates piled way higher than her and nobody said anything to them.  My wife was offended at him. We don't like it when workers at a buffet make comments like that.  3. the sushi boat was not replenished in a timely manner. The sushi was great, but it was gone fast, and it took at least an hour for them to replenish it, by that time, it was too late.  Otherwise the food was great, I'd recommend it. They just need to improve their customer service a bit."}
{"text":"I came here to get some all you can eat vegan food for lunch. The pricy is really good of 12.99 per person . Taxes and 12% tips are included and you should pay upfront which is nice as you can leave right after your done and donor have to weight for the server. Water is self serve which is also nice as you can drink as much as you want without feeling shy to ask for more water. The food is good with lots of variety. They specify if the food is vegan or not. They have a soup stop which I did not like as much I liked the main food. The desert was not a fan of as much . But overall for the pricy you pay the place is amazing. Will definitely come back to check this place."}
{"text":"The Toronto food scene is an ever evolving and growing being. I remember when I was a wee lad that \"Chinese buffets\" (ex Mandarin) were all the rage. These days, there are Italian, Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, Brunch, Korean and of course Japanese buffets. And even amongst these ethnic groups there are countless variations.  Under the Chinese category, now comes the \"first vegetarian\" buffet. I must preface this review by saying that I am not vegan, nor vegetarian so I may hold a bit of bias.   This restaurant seems to have opened up with the exact same decor and set up as its previous life as a dim sum venue (Richlane Chinese Cuisine). In fact, even on the bill it still says Richlane Chinese Cuisine then Blossom Vegetarian underneath.  When you first enter you are expected to pay up front before being seated.   NOTE: 12% TIP IS ALREADY PART OF THE BILL  After paying, you basically grab a seat where ever and there is someone that very loosely will sort of point you in a general direction where to sit.  Water is self serve, at a \"filtered water station\" right by the cashier in the front.   No one bothered to ask whether we wanted anything to drink at any point in time, even though there was a drink menu on the table. It also took them forever to get us any cultery.  The food itself was quite decent. I have been to a few Chinese vegitarian places and this place felt like most of their dishes would do well in a sit down restaurant style.  What this place does lose out on though is the service and set up.  As mentioned this place took over a previous dim sum venue. And it looks like this current incarnation did zero renovations. The food stations are all temporary. For example, they used hot plates to keep some food in pots warm, as well as table top trays to house their food. They also seemed to have very little staff keeping things in order.   So unfortunately by the end of the lunch hour things quickly degenerated into chaos. Food stations were missing utensils. Some stations had utensils from a different station causing cross contamination in food. Food came out quite sparsely and inconsistently. There was a few dishes I tried that I liked and wanted to get seconds, but when I came back it was a totally different dish!  It definitely felt a lot more like a \"pot luck\" style lunch, rather then a restaurant.  I didnt feel at any point in time that anyone was keeping things in order. The Mandarin buffet they absolutely have someone patrolling making sure every food has its own serving spoon. This place there were some people that picked up the spoon and walked off with it.   So given the chaotic set up, this is what tainted our over all experience the most.  Dont get me wrong, the food over all was decent. But the experience and service was extremely lacking.  I would like to give this place another try some day, but I dont see that happening anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Great variety and the food isn't too greasy like typical Asian vegetarian food.  I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"My brother-in-law is vegetarian. When I first found out about Blossom Vegetarian (aka Toronto's 1st Vegetarian Buffet), I knew I had to take him here for his birthday the past weekend :) To my surprise, I have never seen him ate SO MUCH ever in my life, and so care-freely. He didn't have to worry if he can eat this or if there is meat in that. It was a great experience for him! The owner also owns all the Kwan Dim Sum Restaurants, so the quality is definitely there.  \"Vegetarianism does not equate to restrictions.\" Blossom Vegetarian clearly shows that there are plenty of creative ways to make vegetarian food look and taste good! The food is light and not oily/greasy. The restaurant offers dim sum, sushi, a DIY noodle bar, hot food stations, dessert, and much more.  I have to agree with Rodney C. that it felt like a \"pot luck\" style lunch. I wanted to go back for seconds for the food I enjoyed, but it would be replaced by something completely different. That being said, I'm okay with the change, considered that there are limited chafing dishes available. Gotta send someone at your table, from time to time, to check on \"What's New\" lolll  Server was friendly and very on top of things. The gentleman working at the buffet area kept replacing the food with new and freshly made items. The lady at the DIY noodle bar was fast and courteous - noodles were done in no time, and all smiles :) Overall, a great experience.  Definitely a must-go for vegetarians! Vegetarian buffet might not be for everyone, especially for our meat lovers. One important thing to remember, mock meat dishes will never taste like our normal meat dishes. It is mock for a reason lol. Please do come with an opened mind :)  P.S. Ayad F. and I set up a UYE here on Monday July 9, 2018. To RSVP, check out the link below. Hope to see you there!  https://www.yelp.ca/events/richmond-hill-uye-meatless-monday-blossom-vegetarian-richmond-hill"}
{"text":"When you walk in from the outside door (not the door from inside the mall), you'll see a sign that says you have to pay first before the meal. This is different from all other restaurant experiences I've had before so it felt a bit weird. Gratuity charge of 12% was added automatically to the bill after taxes. I did not like the fact that it was added after taxes but whatever, I can deal with it. I had to pay in cash because of the senior (65+) discount of 15%.  We were seated at a table near the windows. I usually don't complain about bugs at restaurants because I know it is impossible to keep them from coming inside. However, flies kept bothering me through my meal and I couldn't help but feel like it ruined the experience. I felt like the flies were attracted to something near the windows but I couldn't be sure.  The variety of food wasn't that great but it is a relatively small restaurant so I thought it was acceptable. The dishes are mainly Chinese cuisine but they serve pseudo sushi, pitas, sandwiches and salads.  I've only had negative experiences with buffets in my lifetime so I had very low expectations for this place in terms of food quality. I was taken aback when I took a bite out of the freshly made steamed dumpling because it was actually quite delicious.   I thoroughly enjoyed the dim sum dishes. The fried rice was a favourite by the other patrons, but in my opinion, it could be much better. It was the only dish not refilled for some inexplicable reason. I also tried the make-your-own noodle soup. You get to choose your own ingredients and type of noodle and a chef will cook it for you. There were 2 choices of broth, tomato and curry laksa. I have next to no spice tolerance so I opted for the tomato one. It was really bland and the chef gave me very little soup to go with my noodles.  For dessert they had taro coconut dessert soup which wasn't very good because it was too watery. There was a variety of different fruit flavoured puddings which I did not try. The watermelon was sweet and the oranges...didn't look too appetizing.   Service was lacking because it was only, I presume, the two owners acting as servers. Plates were not emptied off tables in a timely manner. I felt like they were really trying to save money by not hiring any other wait staff.  I gave Blossom Vegetarian Cuisine 3 stars because I had quite a few criticisms but the food was decent for buffet quality and I was satisfied with my meal so I would come back."}
