{"text":"Love El Nopal Grill at the Stratosphere inside the needle tower! So u have to take the escalator to the top to get here! Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen these days. But find in one with great quality of food, friendly staffs, cleanliness, awesome condiments and affordability on the strip is rare. El Nopal Grill also serve American breakfast as well!"}
{"text":"Location wise. This place is great! It's located on the retail floor of the stratosphere so if you have a craving, you can easily access it. However, it its authentic Mexican food you arrive craving than this place is not it.

The tacos were flimsy, the burrito was filled with too many beans and the quesadilla  (probably the safest Mexican food anyone can buy) tasted like processed cheese and I don't even know where the meat was).

Bottom line: there are better places you can go for Mexican food (including the little stand on the corner across from Walgreens)"}
{"text":"It's more like a fast food restaurant. You order and pay for your food at the cashier counter and pick up your own food at the pick up counter. I ordered the Chicken Sizzling Fajita, it was very tasty. There's a salsa station which I like the best that you can pick whatever salsa you like.  Also, we came for breakfast, it's cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"First off, I like the Strat and I like little hole-in-the wall kind of places that surprise me with good food.  If you prefer higher end accomodations or dining, you may well disagree with me.  

We found El Nopal while wandering the upper mall level on a trip to Vegas in August 2011.   I love Mexican food and had to try it.   We split the nachos and I had a burrito.  The burrito was good, the meat was tender and everything was fresh and made to order.  The nachos were freakin' incredible!!!  There was so much on the platter it was hard to find a place to start.  What made everything better was the salsa bar.  Again, the little things impress me, and while the selection was a bit limited, the tomatillo salso and the pico de gallo were fabulous.  A couple days later, we went back for more nachos after a night of drinking.  They were perfect again.  We had lunch one more time before leaving.  I stuck with the burrito, this time shredded chicken, and it didn't disappoint.  The last time, there was a bit of a wait, but worth it and the staff brought our order to the table when it was ready.  We went back again in October with friends and again the nachos were a hit.  Clearly the best thing they serve, in my opinion.  We went for the breakfast one morning and it was just ok.  

If you want some awesome nachos, and good salsa, check this place out.  It is quick, cheap, with generous portions and I found the staff to be super friendly every time.  There are probably better Mexican restaurants and it is important to note that they advertise as Mexican-American food.  All I know is that my next trip to Vegas is already planned and I know I'll be going back."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic and delicious. I highly recommend this place. Had chorizo and eggs, side of rice and beans\"it was super delicious\". The staff is super friendly and made me feel welcome. It's also very clean, which I love. I will definitely be back and refer my friends and family."}
{"text":"I tried the carnitas burrito and was just freaky awesome! The best Mexican flavor I've tried in the US."}
{"text":"Menu sucks, food blah! I'd rather eat at taco bell, and I don't even like taco bell. Crappy overpriced food and terrible service."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés 2 fois, la nourriture est bonne, le service chaleureux, les prix raisonnables, par contre; les portions sont petites. Quelques ajustements à faire, mais à essayer. Très bonnes sauces maison."}
{"text":"Off the Hook... This place is all around great. It seems like every time we stay @ the Stratosphere Hotel, we always end up here. This place has a variety of items on the menu that taste great and they are affordable. We love the little salsa bar that has a wide range of salsa's from hot to mild, red and green. My wife and daughter love the Carnitas nachos, and I like all items with the shredded beef! Tacos, Burritos or Quesadilla. I have tried numerous items on the menu and I have not been disappointed yet.
I came on a Monday morning with a little hangover! craving Menudo, I decided to give it a try. I waited patiently, and was getting a little frustrated because it was taking a while. Then, the young man brought my Bowl, OMG... it looked and smelled great. This bowl had plenty of meat, just how I like it. I was starting to panic! no crushed red pepper, and what about all the other trimmings. Then, as I looked towards the salsa bar, Hello. All the trimmings! fresh onion, cilantro, limes and fresh red Chile salsa that was Bombay. This was honestly one of the Best Menudo's that i have had, it was on point. If you are looking for something good and affordable, give El Nopal a try. One of the best all around eating spots while @ the Stratosphere."}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped in here for dinner and had two very good chicken burritos, one grilled chicken, one shredded chicken.  Those were very good.  My garden salad was as fresh as could be.  I thought the beans were kind of thin and lame, or I'd have given them 5 stars.  Nice selection of salsas, and the people behind the counter were very nice.  Not fancy food, but as good as not-fancy (and not expensive) food can be.  Oh, and they do serve beers as well."}
{"text":"I work at the Stratosphere occasionally and I am a complete cheapskate.  So unsurprisingly, this place came on my radar when I realized I could use my employee badge to get an employee discount!  Cheap tacos - what a joy!!

Anyways, the tacos are great and the other menu items I've seen when I've had a friend with generally look pretty appetizing too, so there's no room to complain.  Beware that is is pretty much fast food (order done within 3 minutes generally), so it's not designed to be a 5-star joint.  But quality, I've always been very happy with.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Very decent Mexican food. I was pleasantly surprised to find this in the Stratosphere."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad.  I actually ate here twice during a one week stay at the Stratosphere.  My biggest gripe was that the signs located around the retail shops at the tower advertised the Chile Relleno.  Both times though, they did not have the Chile's.  Also, the salsa bar only offered 4 types of salsa.  I'd loved to have seen a real variety here.  The food was edible though, and it's nice to be able to stay at the Stratosphere and  not have to be stuck eating the same things over and over again."}
{"text":"For Vegas pricing this is a good deal. I ordered fajitas and they gave me plenty. The food is authentic Mexican not Tex mex.  the service was good. The sign on the prices is not professional looking. But besides that everything was great."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is their salsa/salad bar. Everything was clean and fresh. They even had little to go containers for the salsa if you got your food to go. We ordered fajitas and ate it there. The fajitas was better than I was expecting since the photos didn't look that good. They served us and 3 other groups after mid night even though they close at 12, which was nice. I liked this place and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If for some god awful reason you get stuck staying or visiting the Stratosphere, this is definitely a good choice for food. I love Mexican food. I AM Mexican. So the fact that I was inside the stratosphere, and saw Mexican food. I figured it had to be better than McDonald's.

Turns out their quesadillas are pretty decent as were their nachos.

But what bumped this review to 4-stars are their breakfast burritos! After a long night of drinking, the breakfast burrito was THE perfect way to soak everything up. I substituted bacon/ham with grilled chicken.

Dear god. It was amazing. Not only do they mix the hash browns with cheese and put a layer of it all around the inside of the tortilla/burrito, but the addition of the grilled chicken, then topping it with tapatio really made it fantastic.

I was so happy. I couldn't believe I found a good, hangover burrito in the Stratosphere. 

4-stars, most definitely."}
{"text":"This place sucks balls. It really does. We only stopped in because we needed something quick to eat. I go the shredded beef taco bowl or whatever the hell it was. My fiance go the bean burritos or whatever the hell it was. When I say, \"Whatever the hell it was\", I mean that it SUCKED and it was not the most generic mexican food I have ever ever eaten. This place should be shut down because they are lying. They should just replace them with a TACO BELL."}
{"text":"Walking up to this restaurant, it looks pretty neat and authentic. That all ended when we were about to order. The menus were not very professional and alot of the items/prices were written in pen. On top of this, the pictures for their listed menu items did not look appetizing at all and clearly should have steered us away from here.

But stay we did because were hoped it would be the \"hidden gem\" other yelp reviews described. I got the carne asada nachos and frankly they were the worst nachos Ive had in a long time. The chips were stale and straight from the bag with the rest of the toppings not being fresh and definitely tasting that way. The steak was serviceable, but just barely. 

The only plus about the meal was they do provide a large portion, but in the end I would rather have a slightly smaller size with better ingredients. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Got to give it to el nopal, I was really surprised how good the food was. I had the menudo and my wife a chile relleno plate both tasted really good. It had that homemade flavor. Micheladas where on point! 
Service could get better but overall it's not that bad. Definitely going back when I hit Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place is bad they have like one cook or something taking forever and messing up plates! 
Don't charge extra for things you aren't going to out in the plate!"}
{"text":"El Nopal

The first time we visited this Mexican eatery, we were under the influence of Jose Cuervo while visiting the observation deck at the Stratosphere hotel and casino. Often when you are under the influence, everything, and almost anything tastes delicious. 

This time around, the Mrs. copied me
and had chicken enchiladas and she remarked that they were very good. The steak quesadillas are very good and I gobbled them right up. They are so cheesy and the steak is chopped very small which helps it go down easy. 

You can eat as this place on a budget. Everything is priced at $8.99 or less, so you're not going to break the bank to have an enjoyable meal. They have a wide variety of salsa and dipping sauces to satisfy any pallet. 

The next time I have a trip to Vegas, I am going to sample this place again. The layout is nice and the tables are a good size that helps with elbow room."}
{"text":"Mexican Cokes oh God yes just what I needed. Breakfast was cheap and good. Its west coast style Mexican food. Its a cute set up not fancy but delish. As far as not being professional menus and the other dumb things I saw in reviews if you want high end go somewhere else this is home food."}
{"text":"Eh, delicious. This restaurant is as delicious as a restaurant on a Wednesday afternoon in the Stratosphere in Las Vegas. Point is, it's delicious. The end."}
{"text":"I like the concept of them cooking basic food for you (tacos, quessidailas, burritors, etc.), and then you dressing it up with all the salsa that you want.  This makes it easy for ANYONE to enjoy their food. I also like that they had a breakfast selection here. The food was good, and fresh tasting...I kind of wish they packed out the tacos more for the price of what they were."}
{"text":"I did not feel like eating Mc D's with the Family so I stopped here to get my fix of Mexican. It did that. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. 

I had the carne asada burrito. I loved the salsa bar, I was able to try 4 different  kinds.

As food courts go, its run of the mill."}
{"text":"Another huge disappointment. This place was recommended by a Mexican employee in the VIP office. I wouldn't be surprised to find out this meat is leftover from the Carver station upstairs which I think is leftover from The Top Of The World. Was definitely not the Mexican food I'm used to in San Diego and even in mexico itself. The wait to get just a burrito was ridiculous long. I counted 25 minutes before my eyes started boiling. Not impressed by the handful of chips to make the $12 burrito look like a good deal. I'd be embarrassed if I were Mexican to recommend this place. I told the girl I was disappointed and she took it as a racial insult. Not the kind of 'sorry it was bad' I was expecting. Jandy is not qualified to recommend anything and I'm wondering how she has a job there."}
{"text":"As a Stratosphere employee I eat here all the time. Taco Tuesday is the best for employees and I love my tacos. Carne asada or chorizo etc. they are awesome cheap tacos that are miles ahead of del taco or Taco Bell. Granted I haven't explored more of the menu here. The employees are always friendly to me and for how busy this place gets good service. If your looking for cheap eats at the Stratosphere instead of burgers, definitely try this place out for tacos!"}
{"text":"Don't eat the breakfast...utter shit. Wish I had eaten the less healthy McDonald's a few hundred feet away at half the price.

The wife and I only at the breakfast here where I'm assuming is not where they excel based on the other reviews.  Either that or nobody in the area knows what Mexican food is supposed to taste like.

Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"To put this short and sweet, the coronas are cold, the carnitas burrito is the best, I give the carne asada burrito four star, and they have plenty in the \"extras\" bar for anyone. I loved their salsa."}
{"text":"My bartender recommended this restaurant to me and my friends. We ate here multiple days during our vacation. Everything taste authentic, fresh, and delicious. We tried various meals from their menu because it was so AMAZING. They are a tad on the expensive side, as everything is ala carte. My only complaint is that they sell fresh fruit, so fruit flies linger."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, but lightning fast...and considering the other options in the stratosphere tower...probably the place to go.

They have a fairly simple menu, enchiladas, burritos, tacos and salad.  You can see the grill where they sizzle up your meat o' choice, shredded chicken or beef, ground beef, etc... Everything has standard rice and beans on the side.  The purist in me feels they should at least have nopales (ummm it is your restaurant name) but no luck.   This is über basic tex-mex.  

Anytime I'm there, it's usually pretty empty. Maybe one group eating...but never a line.  

It'll do."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the taco salad! Enchiladas delicious. Variety items on menu and affordable."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not try their nachos they taste like you are munching on a plastic toy. It hurt my stomach after. They use pre packaged everything. Their eggs are so watery. Hashbrowns are suppose to be crunchy from the top but they were just so mushy and watery. The only thing I liked was salsa. Rest was all trash. It was so bad that I saw a couple try their chicken fingers and they their plate full just like that and got up and left. Bad food. Go else where."}
{"text":"I was expecting to be crushingly disappointed when I walked into El Nopal. For any lover of Mexican cuisine, *all* the red flags are there--location at the Stratosphere across from Perfumania; sign advertising \"Mexican and American food\" in requisite national colors; kitschy, Aztec-derived decor; Carribean salsa masquerading as Mexican music. Nonetheless, I decided to enter and made a shocking discovery. 

This place makes an amazing, authentic carnitas burrito!!! I've been on the quest for carnitas for over 20 years, and it's rarely prepared correctly. You know what I mean--that grey, pulpy crap with globules of fat that often passes as pork. Ideally, it should be lightly crispy, chopped in small pieces and well-seasoned with salt and cilantro. When it's done right, a thin stream of grease should collect at the bottom of the tortilla. And that's exactly what I got here!

Take in mind, I don't believe in ordering a burrito with tomatoes or lettuce. When you're eating fried pork, there's no reason to dampen the flavor with off-season greens. So here, I ordered the burrito with meat, refried beans and rice inside the tortilla. A bit of tomatillo salsa verde on the side (provided free at their salsa bar) and that's it. 

With the substitutions, the burrito came out to $10, with a few XX Ambers for $3.75. Not the cheapest bite in town, but filling and tasty. Take in mind, I'm not going to vouch for any of the other items on the menu. I also have a difficult time believing what I experienced, and plan on returning soon to see if it's a fluke. But until then, El Nopal has my heartfelt recommendation--the first I've given on the Strip."}
{"text":"$8 for a horrible veggie burrito.  No beans and rice but it was full of frozen veggies.  Weird. And then to make it even stranger they slathered it with cheese and some funky sauce making it more like an enchilada.  

I left wondering if anyone working here even knew what a nopal is?"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place, it's relatively cheap compared to just about anywhere on the strip (well it's not exactly on it, it's inside the Excalibur hotel on the upper level where the shops are). The food had good taste and it felt good to eat something that wasn't fast food. My wife and I had two coffees, breakfast and a side of beans we shared it because they gived you a lot and everything was about 13 dollars and we still could not finish everything. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I thought this was just going to be standard take out mexican, but it turned out to be pretty darn good. Went there for breakfast (served till 2pm on weekends, which was awesome), it was just what I needed. Had a huevos rancheros type special. It had a jalapeno sauce instead of ranchero sauce. It came with rice and beans. The portion was perfect and man was it tasty. Even the rice and beans were great. My mom had the acapulco omlette, which was also super good and a great sized portion. The staff was so friendly and the chef came out to talk to diners. The salsa bar had a great selection of fresh salsas. I really liked the flavorful avocado salsa. I was impressed! Everything was great, inexpensive, and great portions. I also really appreciated their use of real silverwhere, cups, and plates. No styrofoam unless you get it to go. That little extra really made me like this place even more. Great place to go if you find yourself in the stratosphere after a late night of partying!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my time here. I always get take out because the atmosphere isn't my cup of tea but the staff is always very friendly. The prices are great, the food has always been enjoyable & the salsa bar is amazing. I'd check this place out if you're in the mood for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very slow weekday morning. Still took over 20 minutes to make a simple breakfast burrito.  
The burrito was small, tasted o.k.  for $8 i expect more.  $3 for a o.j.....so $12 breakfast and left hungry....had to stop at mcdonalds after."}
{"text":"Great place for a snack. Priced well, good choices, and they come check on you! Great service!"}
{"text":"Love this spot the  food is great and the restaurant couldn't be more clean. The salsa bar us small and the options are a bit limited but that being said anything on there is a good choice from mild to hot the flavor is on point. As for the prices you can't really ask for better than $8.00 for three street style tacos rice beans and a bottle of coke. This is one of those spots where you know the food is going to be great no matter what you order service will be friendly and your pocket book isn't going to take much of a hit cause for authentic Spanish fare you can really pay the price here in Vegas. I would recommend this as a deff stop in and enjoy spot for a lunch with the guys or even if you are taking a date out on the town to hold you over until dinner I reccomened the Asada tacos but again anything on the menu is gonna be a great choice."}
{"text":"WOW! My daughter and I went there for breakfast only b/c we had a coupon and were in the Stratosphere. What a surprise! The heuvos rancheros and the Acapulco omelet were delicious! The salsa was outstanding. The decor was nice. Compliments to the Chef!"}
{"text":"Coming from P-Town (Placentia 714) I am accustomed to decent Mexican food at average prices.

The girls and I were staying at the Stratosphere and after a hard morning of drinking we wandered down to the restaurant level on our way up to the Observation Deck.  After grimacing at over priced McDonald's and cringing at the scent of hot dogs and pastrami we found El Nopal tucked in the corner. 

 I was pleased to find that the food was decently priced as this was a total budget weekend for me.  The three of us opted to split shredded chicken nachos which we devoured.  I've never encountered nachos where you have more \"stuff\" than chips and these were them.  We also ordered a side of rice in hopes of soaking up some of the booze in our bellies and it was actually really tasty.  I think the three of us were satisfied for about $8.  Woo!  

The next morning we rolled, bleary eyed, out of bed and all we could mumble was \"eggs, bacon, breakfast burritos...\"  My two eggs and bacon and a Nerga Modelo was under $10.  The eggs were cooked well and the bacon was gloriously greasy.  Throw in some toast and hash browns and I was almost human again.  Vanessa R. said the tacos were sub par and other non-Yelper friend said the burrito was ca-ca, but I wasn't grading too hard I suppose. 

I will gripe about how long it takes just to place your order.  Both visits in a 36 hour period began with us watching the lone cook work the griddle while we waited for someone else to appear to take our order. We got no \"be right with you\" or \"just a sec' which goes a long way with me.  It also a shame there is so little seating.  Whenever we walked by the place looked packed and before I had put my napkin in my plate a woman was breathing down my neck like a vulture.  Also too bad they close pretty early.

Next time I stay at the Strat I'll stop by and see if this was the booze talking or just the prices..."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for great Mexican food , I look for authenticity, I was really surprised that at the stratosphere in Vegas in the second floor they had a Mexican restaurant, at first I didn't think it would be good but when I saw the menu it look really good , I order the ranchera plate for about 12$ with tortillas and a salsa bar , it was Delicious, totally worth it. I went to eat there 2 days in a row."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with pretty good food. This is cafeteria style grilled food made to order. I enjoyed the quesadillas and rice. Really good meal but slightly pricey."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the food court of the Stratosphere. Desiring Mexican food and not wanting to venture out of our hotel, my family and I decided to give El Nopal a try.

The horchata here is delicious. I ordered a carne asada wet burrito. My sister got enchiladas and my dad got a taco salad. The menu selection is wide and so there are a lot of decisions to be made. You can help narrow your choices by choosing the form of food (e.g. tacos, burritos, and enchiladas). My sister's shredded chicken enchilada was better than my burrito and my burrito was better than her shredded beef enchilada. The shredded chicken was nice and moist.

My family and I decided to come back the next day for breakfast/lunch. I got the shredded chicken enchilada and again it was good chicken. I was also able to consume the refried beans with the rice quite happily. Finally, I had a taste of my mom's eggs. I liked the taste. The eggs were prepared with cheese and green bell peppers."}
{"text":"Stayed at the strat from Friday thru Monday and as delicious as the other gourmet and high-end places we visited here this place wound up being my favorite.

You can have a completely diff experience tho, if you don't order the right things. Like ordering the veggie platter at a steakhouse... It's never gonna be that good 

If you come here get the Huevos rancheros (farmer eggs) meal it's amazingly delicious. Fresh protein and it's 5.99!!!! Best deal ever and best breakfast ever. It does take a while to get prepared tho but it's worth it. Other than that my gf got the chicken enchiladas and  she ordered that every single time we went so I think it's safe to say she liked it (even when I offered to take her to fancier places she ended up picking this place!!) 

Get the horchata and be greedy at the salsa bar!! Load up on the pico de gallo!!! And the salsa it's gonna make your plate more healthy and filling without increasing the cost and it taste way better. Skip the coffee tho"}
{"text":"The place looks bland but they have decent food. I would go back if I was staying at the Stratisphere"}
{"text":"Habitant dans le quartier, je suis passé devant ce restaurant un samedi matin par hasard un peu en lendemain de veille... Ils venaient d'ouvrir et n'avaient pas encore toute la carte de disponible mais avaient bien des Burritos!!! Ils m'ont fait gouter leur excellent guac fait maison, leur nachos avec des sauces faites maison aussi... Délicieux! Ils sont hyper sympa, accueillants et agréables. Après avoir payé un prix raisonnable, je suis rentré chez moi avec un burrito poulet pour ma blonde et un buf pour moi... Un régal! Bonne qualité, généreux en sauce et petite salade d'accompagnement. Parfait!"}
{"text":"Waited for an hour while others got their food, finally said something and they took another 15 minutes to make our food. Comes out and they couldn't even get the order right. Food was subpar and definitely not worth the long  wait. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Great food for a quick bite while running around.  In town for the night while traveling and was a nice place to eat while trying to see as uch as possible in one night.  Carne asada fries were great!"}
{"text":"Per usual I am not a fan of Mexican.. Never the less the wife dragged me here. And per usual I didn't leave disappointed. Kinda lower end feeling place but fantastic food. I got a quesadilla and shredded beef and it was very flavorful. The wife got a fajita salad which she said was good. We also got some nachos with shredded cheese on top and a couple drinks.. Paying $26 for a meal in Vegas which isn't bad. If you want a little cheaper McDonald's is right there but I can't suggest that."}
{"text":"a hidden gem................the food is FRESH and tasty.......the chicken burrito was amazing.......the beans and rice were like being back in Los Angeles..the salsa bar is diverse and fantastic.............I cannot recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"Cashier was super nice and patient. My husband ordered an omelet which he loved. I ordered red chilaquiles with asada. The meat was delicious but the sauce was a bit plain. The place is clean and so are its bathroom.  The food cane out quick."}
{"text":"Food is great, I had the crispy shredded chicken tacos and my other half had the soft grilled chicken tacos.  They were amazing!!! I love the salsa table, pick what you want for mild to oh ya that's hot!!!  Down fall, person at the counter seems like she was put out taking our order, Then the person that calls out your number called the wrong number and then all of her tacos were put on one plate instead of two separate orders. If the leak issue wasn't really that big of a deal until the young man went back to get a second plate and cook argued with him. I was standing right there at the salsa counter listening.  Why argue over an extra plate????  Anyway the food is worth it."}
{"text":"El Nopal was my first meal in Vegas.  It is located in the Stratosphere.  There is very limited seating in the dining room.

I ordered the carne asada nachos.  When they came out they LOOKED good...but the steak wasn't hot or even warm.  The steak was very chewy.  There was barely any cheese on the nachos.  I was expecting awesome liquidy queso cheese...instead...a few strings of shredded cheese here and there.  

El Nopal was not worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 - #32/100

The family and I planned on having dinner at the diner inside Stratosphere but found out they were temporarily closed. We didn't want to drive out so we walked around trying to figure out what we wanted that would also fit our budget. 

Came across this restaurant in the retail shopping area of the hotel. It looked like a slow night as they only had 2 tables occupied with 2 diners each and judging from their facial expressions they weren't having any fun. My brother said that they had the supreme nachos here before and it was good so we decided to dine in. Mom wanted the Nachos supreme with carne asada. My big boy ordered the carne asada quesadilla and my bro planned to split the carne asada wet burrito with his wife. I ordered the carne asada taco salad. They were all very good. The carne asada had a really good flavor to it and it was grilled just right. Although the wet burrito was a little disappointing due to more lettuce inside than carne asada I'm not going to dock a star for that. We'll just order all meat burrito next time. You get free refills on fountain drinks, too. For our sweet tooth we ordered the caramel and cream-filled churros. Both were good but I loved the caramel the best. We also got a slice of tiramisu cake, it was ok. 

All in all we were quite impressed and happy with our dinner selection. I'm definitely coming back for more next time."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant mexicain. La nourriture est très bonne et les prix sont raisonnables. Puisque le restaurant viens juste d'ouvrir l'on remarque une certaine hésitation dans le service mais rien qui peut causer problème. De plus, la propriétaire est venue nous voir à la fin du repas pour recueillir nos opinions et nous remercier d'être venu. C'est un endroit que je recommande d'essayer et ce plus d'une fois."}
