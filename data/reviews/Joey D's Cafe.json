{"text":"This place was very good with large portions and friendly staff.  Going to become a regular stop for me when I work in the area.  If you want downhome cooking make your way to this cafe and enjoy."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast food. The place was remodeled and looks very nice inside. The service is always quick. This is a nice place.

The downside is that it all of a sudden is closed. Then several months later they said they are reopened. I mentioned it on Facebook and the owner said he closed on his own to get I to new endeavors. I do not buy that because if you would see what they did with the place compared to the previous tenants.

Anyhow another joint is here called Christine's Country Cooking."}
{"text":"I wish there were star ratings for individual categories. The taste of food is very good- I would give it 5 stars for sure. Speed of service, I would give 1 star. I know a new business just starting out is going to have some kinks to work out, and since this is a new place, I am not trying to be too judgemental. Clearly they need a little time to get on their feet and figure things out. We visited on a Sunday morning, about 10 am. The parking lot was crowded, but there was still plenty of seating available. The decor inside is very cute, they definitely did a good job remodelling. It took a while after ordering for any food to come out, I'd say about 20 minutes. Once the food was on our table, we didn't see our server again until we were finished eating. My friend ordered pancakes and they brought out a tiny shot glass sized cup of syrup, which the pancakes soaked up instantly. He wanted to ask for more, but our server was no where to be seen. By the time she came back around, his pancakes were cold and he didn't even want to finish them. Suggestion-maybe leave a syrup bottle at the table instead like IHOP or Waffle House does?
I feel like they need to hire someone else both in the kitchen and on the floor to speed up service for sure. I will give the place another chance in a few months. The prices are good, and the menu is a bit small, but what they make, they make good. 
They are not open for dinner, just breakfast and lunch. The menu basically consists of breakfast items, lunch sandwiches and wraps."}
