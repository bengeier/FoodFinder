{"text":"First time to OPA and i would have to say it was a very pleasant experience.  The staff were really helpful with suggesting food items and they even educated my on the difference between the meals.  The food was fantastic and the pita bread was soft and delicious.  I would definitely come back and eat here again.  The Lamb was tender and full of flavours with seasoned fries to top it off.  The restaurant is clean and well kept and the employees seemed to have some regulars that come back.    Good job and i'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Opa, but was a disappointed with this location in Country Hills. It's located in the same complex as Starbucks as well as many other businesses and eateries in Country Hills village    While the service was excellent by the two ladies who were working. The food wasn't up to the standard I've come to expect from Opa - which is usually fresh and tasty. I ordered Greek salad with chicken kabob to go. I waited for my order being made. Nothing out of the ordinary. It wasn't overly busy only one other couple was in this location while I was there. Everything looked normal and I left with my order.   When I tasted it I was very disappointed. The chicken was hard as a rock and tasteless. The pita bread was so salty that after a bit it, I threw it out. The Greek salad was so soggy (tomatoes, peppers and onion) and there was way too many green peppers. More of that then anything and very watery. You expect that one thing might be off but the whole meal was off and not something I wanted to consume and expect from an Opa. I was tempted to come back since I was only two minutes away from the location but decided to throw it out and went elsewhere to pick up lunch. Very disappointing and won't be back."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 they always make everything fresh not like other Opa's where the ceased salad has been pre made and sitting out all soggy.   Parking 5/5 lots of parking in a big strip mall.  Service 5/5 the staff here are always so friendly and welcoming   I love coming here especially when I don't have time and need something quick and healthy. Foods fresh and taste great!"}
