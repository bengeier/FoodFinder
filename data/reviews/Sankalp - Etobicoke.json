{"text":"Very clean atmosphere.  Waitresses with thick accent. Great, clean vegetarian dishes. Tasted fresh & clean. No time spent on the crapper!! That says a lot!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and poor service. Several dishes are some preparation of their own, not like any authentic south Indian food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst resteraunt I've ever been to. Their servings don't fill you up and it's like eating cardboard. Their service is beyond terrible. Save your $$ and don't go!!!! Seriously ! Absolutely disgusting! They don't even have clean plates and glasses... And shit on the bathroom stalls... Ew


They don't even deserve a star, but it won't let me review it without one"}
