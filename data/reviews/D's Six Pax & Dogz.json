{"text":"D's is always worth the trip, whether you're stopping by for some food or heading straight to the beer cave to build your own six pack. Maybe it attracts a certain kind of younger crowd, but it is truly a no-frills kind of place and the people working there could not be more friendly and accommodating. The first time I came here our server was super chill and chatty with us as well as patient while we took our time figuring out how many add-ons to pile on top of our food despite the busy atmosphere of the place.

The food is cheap and hits the spot, for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. I will say their seitan wings were particularly crunchy/dry and not altogether satisfying shared between people, but the flavors were great.

But let's be real, you're probably coming here for the dogs. It's cool, I do too. And you will probably want to add avocado to whatever it is you're getting, because avocado is for winners, just like the ocean.

One night, during some seriously biblical amounts of rain and lightning, the power went out temporarily and workers and patrons alike kept on going like it was -no big deal-, demonstrating that the strength of D's can weather any storm."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the food, love the atmosphere. They have the crunchiest and most perfectly fried french fries I have ever had. The hot dogs are filled with so much flavor without overbearing toppings and the poppy seeds give it that extra oomph."}
{"text":"Driving back from here right now. Great first experience. I'm not really a huge hot dog guy either. I eat them twice a year: Memorial and Labor Day. However, the hot dogs were really good. I got the chicago beef dog. Wasn't a huge fan of the relish (don't really like sweet with savory) but I gave it shot. Friend got a custom turkey dog. He said the colesaw was great, as was the entire hot dog. We also split small chili cheese fries. They were fantastic. Fries were crispy. Service was fast.

Great selection of beer. I got the Seamus red ale. The beer cave is awesome. 

Beware of the yellow mustard though. After several washings, my hands are still dyed yellow."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only do they have a wonderful beer selection, they have great veggie dogs!  Make sure you visit the \"beer cave\". My beer-enthusiast friends from the DC area visit D's with every visit to the Burgh.

If they are busy, make sure your name gets put on the list after speaking with the front counter or you may be sitting there for some time."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended when I moved to Pittsburgh two years ago. They have an amazing beer selection, good dogs and they must have expanded the place in the last year because they have a pull up garage wall that I never noticed before. Fries are good too. 

Something about it is gimmicky to me but I'll let it go. Might as well stop here first before going to see a movie across the street..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Food is tasty, but nothing to write home about. Getting a seat can be a problem during lunch or dinner time particularly on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm subleasing an apt across the street and have been in a few times now.  Hot dogs are good and cheap but the burger options, although still good, are close to $10 each.  Nice draft selection but also pricy.  Their happy hour is $1 off drafts 4p-6p everyday, so that's still $4-5 for a beer.  I'll be back though."}
{"text":"I have been to Pittsburgh several times in the last year and this place is one of my favorites.  Not just because the hot dogs are good and variety or them is pretty good too.  I come just for the beer cave!  Plenty of choice in there and the ability to pick your own is awesome!  It gets pretty packed in there on weekends.  Service is no nonsense.  Best is the beer selection in the cave.  This is the reason for the 4stars."}
{"text":"Sick tap selection.  Better than anything in D.C. where I currently live.  I was shocked.  So many Stone beers as well as other breweries that I rarely see.  Went here twice while visiting Pittsburgh.  I liked the scene here.  It was low-key and people were polite.  The hotdogs were great.  I had the Chicago dog.  I loved the peppers they put on the dog; not sure what they were.  I definitely recommend this place if you like craft beer."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times over the last ten years and we generally enjoy the food. Unfortunately, between the two of us we have had food poisoning at least six times as a result of eating at this restaurant. It happened again last night.  What the heck is going on in the kitchen?  This has happened to many friends as well.  I think that we are done giving this place second, third 

Beware!"}
{"text":"Superb beer selection. Great hot dogs. Super fast and friendly service! They ask work as a team. I had everything and was done in less than half an hour, without being rushed. That's great service."}
{"text":"D's is a great place with local charm. The food is some of the best American/bar food you'll find. The hot dogs are always a good option and when I go it's a must to get cheese fries. The pizzas are also top notch as are the wings."}
{"text":"Best beer selection and bar food I've ever had- anywhere. The Vienna Beef hot dogs are delicious and the Buffalo wings the best in the 'burgh. The kielbasa and fish sandwiches are solid, as is their pizza (I was skeptical- I thought, why not stick w/ just the hot dogs since they're perfect? but they're also very good.). Skip the chips- they taste burned. The fries are sooo good- get them with chili and cheese or pub style (cheese and bacon with homemade ranch to dip in)...  Yes if you eat this every day it will kill you, but if you're looking for the best bar food- this is it. If you're looking for the best beer selection- you can't find anything better. Good selection on tap and amazing variety in the beer cave (they say it's ~1000 different beers). Some say Sharp Edge has better on tap...but their food is terrible."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of Russian language students who go to the University of Pittsburgh, figuring locals and Russian speakers would know the best bars.  I was not wrong.

This place is absolutely awesome, with an impressive beer selection and great prices.  The staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  At happy hour, I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.  

For the upscale beer they serve, the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them. 

The music is good, and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.

To Rob, ogromnoye spaceba!"}
{"text":"D's used to be great, but it has fallen behind some of the other offerings in pittsburgh.  A decent beer selection with modest pricing. However, check the price of a beer before you buy it. Some of their selections are not well marked, and I accidentally drank a $15 12oz beer and didn't learn of it till I got my bill (it was mixed in with some $5 beers from the same brewery). 

The  Chicago style hot dog I got was good. But not $6 for 1 standard size dog good. 

So I walked out of there paying $28 (tip included) for 1 beer, 1 hot dog and a handful of fries. Not a good value in my book. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly service and good food. We were here on a Tuesday and it was busy. This place is also kid friendly during early evenings. Great beer selection and they have this beer cave you can walk in and pick a beer."}
{"text":"While living in Regent Square I went to this place way too often! It has a great selection of beer and the food is pretty decent - they probably serve the best fries I've ever had. It feels more like a restaurant in the sense that you wouldn't sit here drinking all night, but if you go for a drink and a dog you're going to have a good time."}
{"text":"This place is no longer the cool hole-in-the-wall place to get a hot dog and beer (from a good selection).  They've expanded and that is both good and bad in my mind.  I liked the small, personal feel to the old place, but it definitely limited how many people who could be in the shop at a time.  So, now they have a much more extended seating area with a bar area and a back room devoted to brews.  I brought my friends here who like beer, and they were ecstatic to find a fave beer that they haven't been able to find anywhere in the DC area.  (Go Pittsburgh!).  The selection is nice and its good to see that I can find those out of the way beers so that I don't have to get just the norm from a beer distributor.  

The hot dogs?  None of us were gushing about them afterward.  But they're ok.  4 stars for the beer selection."}
{"text":"This place was great! I was a little bit let down by the Chicago hot dog as it had too much mustard. That said, however, I was really excited by the beer selection and the neon green relish. If you're looking for a chill meal, this is a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"The best (or worst) part about the two negative reviews below (see Kaete R. and Ryan A.) is that before said dining experience, the diners loved D's enough to bring (or join) friends there. Yet suddenly, D's serves \"garbage covered in cheese\" and yada yada yada, blah blah blah. Grow up, idiots. Why would you expect a restaurant to split your large check when on the menu it clearly states that parties of six or more will not be split? D's probably won't miss you, and neither will us regulars."}
{"text":"During my visit to Pittsburgh, I wanted to experience the best that the city has to offer when it comes to local dives. And this place did not disappoint simply because of their awesome selection of imported beers and microbrews in the \"cave\". Just be prepared to shell out the cash for it. Any place that serves Delirium Tremens on tap deserves high praise! 

As a Chicago native, I've had my fair share of meat encased goodness. And while these signature dogs are very good, its hard to crown them the best I've ever had. On the other hand, the fries were perfectly crispy and delicious. therefore a must.  The waiting staff was super friendly and its plugged in a great neighborhood. Overall, I'd give the place 4 1/2 stars instead of the 4 if I could. 

What I had:
Big Ben hot dog (typical Pittsburgh toppings)
Chili cheese fries (the small was enough for two)
Cold glass of DT (duh!)

When did I go:
Saturday @ noon - plenty of space without the wait

Will I come back? 
Even though it was my first time, I would definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I frequent here for happy hour. Amazing food. Amazing service. Always!! I highly recommend if you're in search for great beer, food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Can't give this place good enough praise.  This is a beer lovers dream- and I know people say that but this is coming from a true beer lover.  They have hundreds of bottles for sale from all over.  The food is great and selection is also good for bar food like pizza and burgers and hot dogs really shine."}
{"text":"The food is really good.

The beer selection is AWESOME. Sadly though, you pay a high price for the big selection of beer. Even at happy hour there are absolutely no good specials at this place.

For a meal and 2-3 beers look to pay anywhere from 25-35 dollars even at happy hour."}
{"text":"The beer selection to make your own sixer is incredible. So many beers from all other the U.S. And international. The crafty hot dogs were incredible especially the angry tiki dog. I'll def be coming back here."}
{"text":"D's is a legend in beer in Pittsburgh. The selection can't be beat and the food is unique and a style all its own. Thanks's for the years of beers, D's"}
{"text":"D's is my place! They have enough types of beer to tickle my fancy and the fancy of 25 others at the same time. And then we can all eat Big Ben dogs and die happy together. 

Go to D's."}
{"text":"D's has so many great things about it, it's hard to pick which one's the best. The whole atmosphere of the place is great, very laid back and everyone there is always enjoying themselves.

Obviously, the beer selection is great. I don't know how many different brews they typically have on hand, but it's a lot.  And you're encouraged to go pick out your own beer from the walk-in cooler, even if you're sitting at the bar.  The staff there is always friendly and you can sample some of the beers on tap if you're unsure of what you want.

The food is pretty good too.  The dogs can be simple or loaded with all kinds of toppings, and are a staple of D's.  They also have a good selection on the rest of their menu too.  Chili cheese fries - great.

If you haven't been there yet, stop by in the afternoon on a Saturday or Sunday for a great local vibe."}
{"text":"went here with a couple friends who live in Pittsburg for a quick drink.  Really cool atmosphere.  I got the run down as we sat about how it's a beer store and bar/grill all-in-one.  weird liquor laws i suppose.

they had about 20-24 brews on tap.  went with the Terrapin Hopsecutioner, which I've had before and really enjoy it.  They had a lot of local seasonals on tap, but I had to drive and I was tired, so I stuck to only one.

Food was decent.  Typical bar/grill menu.  We ordered up some Pub Fries and Wings.  Decent, nothing special, but I wasn't expecting the world.  My friend got a Chicago dog that looked amazing."}
{"text":"D's is the 'it' place for Pittsburgh... especially for those that like beer. There are several Belgian pubs around Pittsburgh, but D's is a whole different experience. 

Yes, the cave is like a candy shop. The cave is located in the back of the left side. The first time I went (after reading Yelp reviews) I was a little intimidated to head straight past the bar. It's not like BevMo so don't expect to save a lot on a six pack but if you're interested in sampling and trying out different craft or imported beer it's the place. Plus, who can resist a cheap, filling hot dog?

Hm.. hungry. I'm going there now."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs. LOVE their DOM (Dog Of the Month) Its always something crazy. For September 2015 is the Greek dog. They have great burgers too. Somewhat crowded, but still so worth it."}
{"text":"Everyone else has talked up the humongous beer selection, so I won't belabor the point.  You can always find the old favorites, as well as literally hundreds of things you've never tried or even heard of before.  Plus, they have a wide and rotating draft selection.  (By the way, unless you're one of those people who needs to see the label turn blue, most of the beers in the non-cold room are plenty cold enough to drink as it is.  It's the beer *cave*, not the beer *greenhouse*, after all.)

The menu has expanded recently, but the hot dogs are still the best part.  (A close second is the sausage sandwiches...)  The chili cheese fries will clog the hell out of your arteries, but you *will* like it.

The mural opposite the bar (see one of the profile pictures) sometimes reads like a term paper on the history and varieties of beers, but it still makes this place the most educational bar (on any subject other than anatomy, anyway) in Pittsburgh.  The mural in the other room, depicting a wide variety of local and global celebrities, is pretty entertaining, too.

Not really good for groups---while they'll be happy to have you, finding seating for all of you is likely to be complicated.  Plenty of food to please the age-inappropriate among you, and they've even got a quite good root beer on draft.  If they've got liquor under the bar somewhere, I've never seen it, but they've usually got a couple bottles of house wine open.  (But what did you expect?  It's a beer bar.)"}
{"text":"Beer selection- awesome.  Food- ok.  The wings need to be ordered extra crispy in my opinion.  The D's house sauce was not good.  The swissvale gold was really good.  Ok service."}
{"text":"Frosty drafts, the best veggie dog I've ever tasted, and delicious whole wheat-crust pizza.  Thankfully, since their beer selection is vast and ranges from relatively cheap to ridiculous, the food is generally well-priced.  Toning it down on the drinks can easily bring your bill down to a manageable twenty bucks for two people.  They get a little extra bump from me because they so graciously hosted the Pittsburgh Beer Society for a long time, AND gave PBS members 10% off their beers.  The downside?  Service can be spastic, and I've never seen each person at a table get each of their meals at the same time.  One person can scarf down two (delicious) Chicago dogs long before their partner receives their (equally delicious) calzone.  

But Omar, hipsters and yuppies?  Aside from the occasional pair of skinny jeans and a trucker cap or two, I've seen mostly families taking advantage of D's great prices and groups of friends chatting and sharing drinks.  It's definitely not a place to go to see and be seen, which suits me just fine."}
{"text":"I agree with others that the beer cave is wonderful.  I could stay in there for hours!  The pizza ain't bad either!"}
{"text":"Best ranch dressing in Pittsburgh!  Good beer selection, good food, good place to meet with friends."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my evening experience here last night. The bar was really busy but service was still fast. They only serve beer and wine downstairs. If you want a mixed drink you have to go upstairs. We ordered a large supreme pizza, and it was really good! The wait staff was super nice!! Would definitely grab food and drinks here again"}
{"text":"Had the Big Ben turkey dog and my husband had the Chicago veggie dog.  Both were amazing! We also had wings with D's House sauce- great flavor.  I had been wanting to go for a long time and finally made the trip across town- would definitely go back.  Great eats in a low key , inexpensive place ."}
{"text":"The hot dogs (I prefer the Angry Tiki) are the best I've ever had, but surprisingly, this establishment has become my go-to pizza shop in Regent Square. 

Prices for pizza are incredibly reasonable, and the Texas BBQ never fails to disappoint. I don't drink, but the beer cave is no doubt very impressive for beer fans.

My only negative would be how packed the place gets when the bar crowd rolls in, but if we're ordering dinner, we just take it to go. I'm assuming the crowd would be a positive for some people, so I'm not going to bother taking a star off for it.

Good hot dogs, good pizza, good wings, good sweet potato fries. D's is what's up."}
{"text":"It's pretty good bar food, but usually you end up hating yourself for eating it.  Fries smothered in cheese and bacon are good but not super healthy.  The dogs are good, but the pizza, burgers, and wings are where it's at.  Also beer cave."}
{"text":"This is clearly not a place to come for a healthful salad.  As long as you can accept that and are in the mood for junk food concoctions taken to a new level (aka fried fries (yes they're double fried and extra crispy) topped with \"pub cheese\" and bacon and dipped in ranch) or one of their many \"unique\" dog toppings (such as the special Carolina Dog that was topped with pulled pork and coleslaw.)

This is also one of the few places where any beer snob will feel happy and non-beer snobs can also enjoy a nice bottle of Lindeman's or the likes.  

The place is especially bumpin' during sporting events, so either come early or be prepared to wait for a table if the big game is going on."}
{"text":"Excellant, love this place, great burgers and wings, fries and atmosphere great for friendly conversation! !!"}
{"text":"My wife and I lived in Pittsburgh for 2 yrs and we ate at D's all the time... It was our go-to place to eat.

Never had a bad meal there and we tried a lot off the menu. The beer cave has a great selection. We live back in NC now and I crave a couple hotdogs and some cold beers from D's quite often."}
{"text":"good beer selection- both on tap and in the beer cave. located in a nice neighborhood.  the chili cheese dog is fantastic and so are the fries!!"}
{"text":"great beer selection and good dogz."}
{"text":"I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.

The first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order, a kitchen guy ran it out, and then no one ever came back for 45 mins.  I went to the counter for my check and thought that I wouldn't give it another go.  Well, you can't say I didn't try.

 I had the barbeque chicken pizza the first time and it wasn't bad, but its not a place I'd make my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"A coworker and myself are in town for business and went looking for something local and good. We saw this little place and went in and were greeted by the nicest people around. The atmosphere was inviting and really had a welcoming warmth that will leave me missing the place until I return. The hot dogs are off the charts!!! Everything we had was superb and fresh. Basically cooked right in front of You! Highly recommend this little gem to anybody passing through. If your a local and haven't been here... what are you doing!?!?"}
{"text":"went for a late lunch with friends. I'm a new single mom with a 7 month old and my friends had a 2 year old along as well. our server was extremely attentive and incredible about the kiddos being along. he brought crayons for the toddler and was one step ahead of our needs which was amazing and unique... it's not always easy to go out with a kid in tow where you can get great patient service AND good food and beer. I had the Cuban dog (pretty terrific) and sweet potato fries. one small order could probably feed 2-3 people...good to know for next time. the beer selection was super. I've been looking for barleywine style ales in this area and most places I've tried haven't even known what I was asking for. these guys were able to help me put together a cool sampler of a few different kinds to take home and try. this was a great visit and D's will definitely be on my beer and food radar in the future. also loved the open air bistro feel for summer. the price seemed a little high for hot dogs but the dogs were really tasty and after it was all said and done, I feel like the value of the hospitality, the good food, and the atmosphere were well worth it."}
{"text":"D'z dogs is the best. All the employees seem to want to be here. Nothing is better then when your food provider is excited about what he/she is doing. Come try a scorpion dog.!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My fiance and I moved to the Regent Square area in May and we've been to D's multiple times in the three or so months since. The food is good--fairly typical bar fare--but it's the beer that keeps bringing us back. Their selection is huge (see: beer cave) and I've had some amazing beers that I didn't know even existed. The employees really know their stuff and will help you pick a beer if you don't know what you want. My fiancee is not a huge beer fan but the bartenders/waitstaff have been successful in finding him something he likes. They also have at least three gluten-free beers for those with gluten sensitivities. The atmosphere is not too loud or crazy and is a nice place to go if you want to be able to hear your companions.

The sad part is that D's closes fairly early--the bar closes at 11 on Sunday-Wednesday and midnight on Thursday-Saturday. The kitchen closes an hour before the bar."}
{"text":"Always a good time. Being newer to the area I love this neighborhood. This place is so well run and always has a great vibe. The beer cave is a must see also the relish for the hot dogs is to die for."}
{"text":"I don't come here to eat much, I usually come for the beer cave. Best build-your-own six pack joint in the city!"}
{"text":"I've been there many times, and they consistently have proven to have great food and service. Oh, and they have Vegetarian friendly options too!"}
{"text":"The only place outside of Chicago that does a proper Chicago dog.  I love their crispy fries.  No matter how you order them, you won't be disappointed.  Pub fries are our family favorite. 

Save yourself a few bucks and grab your own bottled beers from the beer cave. You aren't going to find a better selection of beers in the city.  Sure some places might have a larger selection of beers on tap, but D's is the only place you will find 6 varieties of actual authentic French Saisons in season.  Pizza is excellent and rivals any pizza only place in Pittsburgh. 

Super kid friendly is the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I am not huge on hot dogs or beer. However, I am huge on add-ons. This is where D's comes in. I totally recommend the chihuahua hot dog. It has avocado!!! The wings are delish too. This place is a must go for beer lovers. I am still the light and sweet kinda beer person, so I tried something with raspberry notes in it, and LOVED it! Oh and the fries are awe-frickin-some!! My second fave in the city after Point Brugge."}
{"text":"I'm not from PA, I'm from VA.  In VA I worked at a wine and beer bar, where we served and I tasted some of the best beers in the world.  And in VA we don't have absurd old beer and wine control laws, meaning our access to reasonably priced, intelligently stocked beer is much higher than pittsburgh.  That said, the best selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's.  You will find a number of american craft brews, trappist ales, etc.  The only problem is the price...  which is solvable.  D's has a great system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off the bottle.  This dollar off doesn't matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off are not much higher than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  The only problem is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.  

Also, I've never eaten here, because hot dogs are generally not good.  Furthermore, I'm not sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good service.  So ignore anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer. Finally, parking sucks there's a lot of very busy restaurants and businesses on the same street, so expect to walk a little."}
{"text":"D's has long been a stand-by for a good veggie hotdog and a nice beer selection for me. It has reasonable bar food and a reasonably priced wide selection of beer. My meat-eating friends seem to really like the wings and various meat hotdogs and burgers.

It is always very crowded during peak dinner times, even early in the week in my experience. Extpect a long wait on weekends for sure! 

D's is a comfortable place to go for me and attracts a young-ish crowd but not to young. The atmosphere is lively and casual.

Service can be slow but the servers are always friendly. Overall this is a good casual food place. The walk-in beer cooler and additional beer selection are a draw as well. 

They do have some vegetarian options as well, which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"What a place. What a selection.  I love it.  

This place allows you to view hundreds of beers from around the world.  You can buy mixed six packs as well. 

The food is great and service is just fine."}
{"text":"The beer selection is incredible. If you're ever looking for something stop by here - they most likely have it.

The dogs (which are the only thing I've ever gotten) are excellent. You just can't beat a good beer and a good hot dog, and this place does both extremely well.

I try to hit this place at least once a year."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go have a drink.  There are really 2 areas, each of which are well-worth the trip alone.  The first area is the \"beer cave\".  Think high-end bottle shop, organized by country of origin.  There are some really rare finds that rotate through, plus all the favorites as well.  Anything in the beer cave (I thik there are over 1000 brands!) can be taken over to the eating area, and there is a rapid chiller to cool down your unrefrigerated bottles.  There is also a large walk in fridge to grab beers as well.

The eat-in area serves a variety of quite good bar food, although I've only had the hot dogs once or twice.  The fries are great, and the draft selection in this area is awesome as well.  

Overall, go here if you want a great beer selection and good bar food.  It's always pretty busy and the service is good!"}
{"text":"Though you may hear this comment about many places in Pittsburgh, D's Sixpax & Dogz is a bit of an institution. 
This place used to be a tiny closet-like neighbour bar. It has expanded in the past couple years, moved the beer around and now they keep most bottles in a walk in beer cooler. They also have a rotating selection of draft beers. They still have a beer cave in the back. 

The beer selection is quite good. The service can be both good and bad, depending on the server you get. The place is very relaxed. The food isn't particularly memorable. I enjoy the fish sandwih. Fries are good. It's great for groups. It can get quite busy."}
{"text":"D's is a fantastic place with food! Reasonably priced and a nice atmosphere! Can get crowded but that's because it's soooo good! I love the selection of beer, it always me to try out a new beer without having to buy a whole case!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I recommend the Cin-Ds pizza sub red sauce! Fast and friendly service! I would come back here again. Fries are good too. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff is always friendly and hustling, the food is great and the beer selection is excellent. Easy choice when you are in Regent Square."}
{"text":"Legit! Everything you want out of a hot dog spot. The fries were killer. Endless beers to choose from. Every style dog you can think of. Laid back music. Friendly environment. Cool spot."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype for D's, although I guess their beer selection *does* rule.  If selection drives your decision-making, definitely head on over.  However, if you'd like to receive anything other than slow, resentful service from your waitstaff, or food that is anything above sub-par, head on by without stopping.  I've lived just down Forbes from D's for 3 yrs, and walk down there with friends a lot during the summer and early fall.  I'm also a former bartender and waitress, so I can say with experience and certainty that I've received just downright terrible service there about 80% of the times I've been.  Once, a friend and I stopped in for lunch with her kids and ended up waiting for the check 18 minutes after we'd asked to receive it.  We were both fuming, and the waitress just looked annoyed and kept ignoring us to chat with her buddy.  Another time, my husband and I came in 15 minutes before the ordering deadline, and watched as the waitress did not approach our table until exactly the cut-off time.  She proudly announced that we could no longer order food (we just wanted pretzels, for god's sake).  Food is pretty lackluster, although it's a nice touch that they have veggie dogs.  Upstairs, expect about the same level of service, with a douchy element of annoyed resentment from the bartender, along with even douchy-ier clientele. 

I know D's is a favorite neighborhood place, but I'm tired of the abuse from waitstaff who look annoyed that I'm even there.  If this was just a once-in-a-while occurrence, I'd be forgiving, but 3 years is long enough to judge."}
{"text":"Awful service; took us 2 and a half hours to get our food and the waiter forgot several items (then added a few beers we didn't order on to our tab; I'm assuming because he thought we were too drunk to notice.) Then we find out that after we had nicely split the tab for them (even adding in an extra $10 on top of the grat because we were too lazy to re-do the math) that they wouldn't split the check? In the time we argued about it, you could have run the 3 credit cards we had and been done with it.

Had to argue with the manager (who was completely unhelpful, with one of the waiters standing behind her and being rude to me for backup) for 10 minutes and they didn't give us an inch. I would have stiffed the waiter for the awful service if I could have; but we got gratted so I didn't even have that option.

If you want to come here with more than 3 people, avoid D's. Their beer is severely overpriced ($10 for a beer I can get at Sharp Edge for $6? no thanks!) and the food is the same fried garbage covered in cheese you can get at any other bar in Pittsburgh.

In other words, don't come here. I used to like this place, but tonight was such a bad experience I'll just go to one of the other places in Pittsburgh that serves hot dogs, french fries and beer. There are plenty of them, I won't miss D's at all."}
{"text":"First off, even though McBrooms is the place to get beer... D's is a great second option when I want to get something nicer, or when McBrooms is closed. Anything from a case to a single bottle whenever you need it, already chilled, no strings attached. Prices are fair for the service too, and a walk-in beer cooler is definitely a plus. 

Also, the hot dog selection is great for both carnivores and vegetarians. My two favorites being the Chihuahua dog and the red alert dog. Spicy, spicy."}
{"text":"Place was awesome.

Delirium on tap.

Hot dogs with mac n cheese on them."}
{"text":"Draft Belgian beer and a Mason Dixon dog."}
{"text":"I absolutely love D's with all of my heart. If you're looking for a plain dog and fries (boring) they have what you want. If you're looking for a Mac n cheese dog or one with bacon and pineapple with sriracha and a side of chili cheese fries, they've got you covered too. Add in an enormous draft selection, a beer cave 1000 beers deep, and just the right game always on, and you've got my choice for a Saturday evening. 

Not to mention pizza for days, innovative burgers that'll blow your socks off, and CORNDOGS. Just go here be happy."}
{"text":"Best fries around and a really good beer selection.  A little bit of a drive for us, but we always find a reason to go.  The staff is beyond friendly"}
{"text":"Best hot dog in town with a variety of different toppings and styles.  Amazing selection of beers in the back.  Great place to go with friends on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I went to d's for a yelp event and it was awesome!   It was the first time I'd ever been there and I'll be going back.   We had wings, hot dogs,  and awesome homemade chipotle hummus.  They even had veggie dogs for my cousin! Everyone there was so nice.   If you drink good beer the beer cave will awe you. ..hell I drink Miller lite and I was in awe.   So many beers!"}
{"text":"Home style food was a nice change. Didn't have to wait for a table on a Sunday afternoon. I'm not sure if I enjoyed their appetizers as much as the entree. Everything was really oily. The pizza small is a good size for one."}
{"text":"I can't say anything about service as I ordered delivery from postmates but the food was on point. Ordered 2 turkey dogs with different toppings. It was split down the middle and grilled to perfection. I was shocked at the size of the turkey dog. It looked and tasted like a normal hot dog. The sweet potato waffle fries were good but my husbands pub fries were better. I'm a sucker for battered fries though. Worth the money and my hub's small fry was enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Great place for bar food. Good draft list and my veggie hot dog was pretty tasty. The fries were excellent. The place is very casual and pretty crowded on the weekends."}
{"text":"UPDATE: July 2013

Went back for a visit to the alma mater and decided to stop in at D's before heading out. I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.

GF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the \"deglutenized\" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well. 
They also have at least three varieties of New Planet, and at least two of Greens. Dogfish Head T'weasonale. Possibly New Grist and Tread Lightly? I was in a haze of deliciously non-gluteny beer at this point. 

Nachos: Maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I think when I've had these in the past they are made with real cheese - you know, shredded and melted. This time they were served with that nasty-ass liquid cheese goop, like you get at a ballpark. Blegh. 

Still four stars overall! Avoid the nachos though.

---

The only food I've ever had here is nachos, so I can't speak to that. I WILL speak to the beer selection, though! I've managed to collect quite an assortment of beer snob friends, who love spending hours (literally) in the Cave o' Beer. I have to eat gluten free, so most ordinary beers are off-limits for me, BUT, they have an enormous selection of hard cider! Many many different kinds, including my favorite cider in the whole world, JK Scrumpy. Totally reasonable prices, too.

Now the bad:
1. They close at midnight! After the downstairs closes you can take your drink upstairs to a little bar, but it's super loud, has no seating, and you don't have access to the magical treasure trove of beer. Boooo.
2. This is totally a niche thing, but I wish they had a better selection of gluten-free beers. There are lots of tasty ones out there, but they often only have Bards and Redbridge."}
{"text":"It was gooooooood chilly cheese fries and hot dogs what else can u ask for ? They have Tons of beer for the ones that want beer. I was here at noon so we did not have beer. It was reasonably priced the staff is good. Hands on. Music was great ! We will come back"}
{"text":"As if this place needs another glowing review!

When I first moved to Pittsburgh, a local clued me in to the wonders of D's. She leaned forward and whispered, \"....yeah 'suchandsuchbar' is alright, but if you want the BEST beer selection in Pittsburgh with the friendliest staff, go to D's Six Pax and Dogz.\" 

She proceeded to give me directions. Mind you, this was a total stranger. But I liked the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.) 

Walking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes, I'll definitely have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't get any better, you're clearly not following along close enough-you get $1.00 off every bottle you take to go. 

Bobby and I brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend was in awe. The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes to D's is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not, I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing over crafting the perfect six pack. Of course, this isn't D's fault. I'm naturally indecisive. 

I love this place so good."}
{"text":"Usually get the bacon cheddar dog which is awesome but tried the pizza tonight.  It was great!   Good quick service, great food and a superb beer selection."}
{"text":"It's getting three stars for the beer selection.  The hot dogs are nothing special, nor is one enough if you're hungry. I can buy a package of hot dogs at Giant Eagle and get the same effect times 10.
Last time I was there someone said the pizzas looked good. Next time."}
{"text":"I've been trying to find new and different restaurants recently, and this is one I found:

About the place:
- It's small
- It's packed and crowded.
- Due it's size, they seats near the walls are all awkward and can't be comfortable.
- I wouldn't recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time.
- There is free parking outside, but you are going to have trouble finding a space

The food:
- NOTHING COMES WITH THE HOT DOGS AND MEALS COME WITH CHIPS. The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place.
- I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries.
- The chili cheese fries are very very good and are some of the best I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people.
- You get one hot dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs with toppings at the local Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for $6.50, so it's not the cheapest.
- The hot dog buns are good and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot dogs are just typical size and aren't super fat or foot longs.

The staff:
- They are overworked but they are nice.
- One of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover, so I could easily see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.

Suggestions for D's:
- Please sell curly fries or pretzels!
- Stop being cheap. Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG.
- Try to get a bigger place
- Lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.

Would I go back? Definitely."}
{"text":"This has always been my go to bar on the far East End. Always a great draft selection, you can't beat the bottle selection, and the food is passing for typical bar/pub fare. Location is good, street parking is never a problem, and ambience is slightly better than average. Beer is fresh and kegs are rotated regularly. Highly recommended! Can be crowded at dinner/lunch times."}
{"text":"This is a beer lover's dream and one of my favorite spots in Regent Square.  Great place to go to watch a game.  It is also kid friendly as almost every time I am visiting this place there are families with young children enjoying themselves.  The biggest decision is to pick a beer off the draft list which always has a great selection or pick one from in the beer cave. I usually try a draft and then head into the chilled beer cave. There is also a larger section of single beers for purchase in the back that are not cold. If you want to drink them while at the restaurant they have a chiller-so cool!!  My past visit I was impressed by the large selection of pumpkin beers. I tried a bottle called Baked by Lancaster Brewing-tastes just like pumpkin pie!!  To go with it I ventured from my usual Chicago dog and ordered the Angry Tikki-pineapple, bacon and special cheesy, sweet and spicy combo mixture of sauce. I was not disappointed and a great choice. The poppy seed buns they serve the dogs on are the best!"}
{"text":"Lunch, dinner, drinks, whatever. D's doesn't disappoint. They have yummy food, with a good selection of vegetarian options. Seitan wings for wing special Monday... Yes please! The draft list is lengthy and diverse  (most of the time).  Also, the beer cave. What can NOT be found there. I must say, I wish they had more selections in their cold case considering the vast amount of diversity available in the beer cave. But, let's not get too choosy here, right? Come hang at D's. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...

This place? 

Without a doubt go here.

Every and any beer you could ever want.
Nice staff.
French fries from heaven.
Hotdog creations similar to Van Gogh.
A speedy beer chiller.
TVs at all the right angles.
A bar and a dining area.
Did I say beer cave?

Go, just go."}
{"text":"My son and I got a chance to eat at our favorite restaurant, D's in Regent Square.  The food is simple, great tasting, and affordable! The service is always friendly and on time...I believe they value my time.   We both got our favorite dogs and the best French fries in Pittsburgh.  The server also signed me on for no wait app which made our checking out and paying sooo easy."}
{"text":"This place is an old favorite. I used to live close by and would swing by for good brew and some yummy dogs. At times when I was vegetarian, there was always something just as appetizing. I also love their pizzas, especially with the whole wheat crust, which is hard to come by elsewhere. These days, my husband and I make it a date to spend an afternoon in Regent Square and finish off with a good late lunch at D's. The beer selection is amazing."}
{"text":"The food is always sort of room temperature, but it's delicious! 
There's a cave. Of beer. 
There's always a longish wait to get a seat, but I can say, they do their best to accommodate. My first time here, we had a large group and failed to call ahead, yet they found somewhere to put us and took good care. 
This area of town is adorable, and I'm looking forward to heading out in the spring time and enjoying some hot dogs in the warm air!"}
{"text":"This place has a Beer Cave!  Seriously, that's what they call it.  We got to go in and select the beer of our choice from shelves and shelves of single bottles, everything from Bud to Hoegaarden to Chimay and back again.  So many beers I've never even heard of.

Anyway, they have hot dogs too...soooo many choices.  I came with a group and we all easily satisfied our hot dog cravings.  I had the veggie dog with cheese, tomatoes and dill pickles, and it was so so yummy.  Everyone else was thrilled with their dogs as well.  We also got cheese fries with ranch dipping sauce, fried zucchini, and onion rings...and heart attacks...just kidding, but damn what a greasy meal of awesomeness!"}
{"text":"For my 200th review, I'm going to write a review for D's Six Pax & Dogs, which couples a review I just wrote for The Loft- a bar just upstairs from here owned by the same people. I've been to D's a couple of times with groups of friends, and this is quite a fun and neighborhoody venue with good food (amazing veggie dogs!) and great beer. The owners pride themselves in being a little more family friendly, and it seems that this is true from the crowds I have always seen here. But fear not fellow 20 single somethings: this place can be for you too! There is ample room at the bar to chill with good beers to watch the game, and also bring a group of friends to one of the adjoining tables. If I lived over in the Regent Square/Wilkinsburg area, I would stop in here more often. However, it has become a cool bar that I frequent before/after a movie at the Regent Square Theater. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awesome. That is D's.

Burgers, dogs, and fries are so done, right? Wrong. Excellent toppings, excellent food, excellent beer selection. The fries and vegetarian selections are well done, so no one feels left out.

I didn't know about this place until I started getting into trying odd micro-brews and I was looking for some different beers I had while living abroad. The beer cave is an experience and you will not be letdown. I have yet to meet someone who feels that D's is anything less than stellar.

Sidenote: I highly recommend D's Sixpax for someone's 21st birthday to pick out a six-pack from their epic selection of brews. (Also, buy them a hot dog, cheapskate!)"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's very own \"Cheers\"

I've lived in Pittsburgh for about 5 years now. I've been coming to D's for about 3...D's is one of the many gems of Regent Square.  It really is the place (if you go often enough) that everyone really does know your name....as well as what you like. Or in my case...the only beer I actually like enough to drink more than once.  The bartenders are all amazing people and really make you feel comfortable. The service is great and they are always ready with a recommendation for any newbies. All it takes is a few questions and they have a few suggestions. I have a friend who loves Magic Hat, and when finding out that D's didn't have it on tap that night, was totally bummed. When she told the bartender that she usually drinks MH, he made a recommendation. I was not at all surprised (she was) when she loved what he'd suggested. 

Your trip to D's wouldn't be complete without trying something from their extensive menu. Their hot dogs are great (and for those of you who are vegetarian, they have awesome veggie dogs), the pizza is delicious, and if you're craving wings, there's no better place to go (try the Jamaican jerk...they're my favorite!).

Okay, so you're thinking good beer, good food, good service, what more could they possibly offer?  DON'T LEAVE YET! Before you head home, hit the beer cave and take some to go. If you can't find something to drink here, you may just be too picky (or a non drinker, which is totally okay, but I would suggest the root beer they have on tap before you give up.) 

My sister and I stopped in over the weekend for some pizza. We had the pleasure of meeting Dino, the owner. He's incredibly friendly and just a nice guy ( he bought us both a drink!). We chatted for a bit, and he moved on to greet some other patrons. I think it says a lot about  any place when owners and employees alike can be found there on a day off. 

If you're visiting Pittsburgh and anywhere close (heck...even if you aren't close) head to D's and grab a taste of a great local bar"}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection on tap as well as bottled. You can get beer to go warm or cold and do mix and match six packs. Also, they have tons of vegetarian options. Great for Veg bar food."}
{"text":"extensive beer selection!

yum hot dogs! (and veggie dogs)

====================
hot dogs + beer = best thing ever
====================

It's pretty cheap, and now after their renovation there is a big non-smoking section. I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Something different here.

Food, schmood, go there and drink the beers from the beer cave.  I don't think you have to wait for the server to open your beer, they'll notice and charge your accordingly.  It's all walk in and self service beer, why don't more places do that?!

Mike"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. Entrees come out before apps. Burger patties are about the size of a fast food chain - thin, frozen cardboard. Dogz aren't bad."}
{"text":"Their dogs are off the hook, try the Chicago dog or the Bug Ben!  Incredible beer selection too."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Pittsburgh, great hot dogs, pizza, veggie burger. Pub fries are actually worth the 100,000 calories. Great place to watch sports. Super friendly, knowledgeable service. Part of why Regent Square is so great."}
{"text":"My husband and I live walking distance to D's and we do love D's... but the place is always so crowded and noisy, that I can't give it more than 3 stars.  

I can't add much in the way of reviews here as to the food here, I think everyone has pretty much hit the nail on the head. The dogs are good, and I am happy they have veggie dogs. Beer selection is amazing.

It's very family friendly, so if that's what you are looking for this is the place for you. Personally, I work with children all day  & love them to death, don't get me wrong... but I find parents here tend to let their children act out a lot, and I find it really distracting and not relaxing. Since I am with children all day, I like my meals to not involve yelling and running children. So to solve that problem, we just order take out and eat our dogs at home!"}
{"text":"This was another place that came highly recommended while we were in town and this place also didn't not disappoint! 

The food was good.  The dogs were tasty and they had some interesting recipes but let's cut to the chase....

the beer selection is massive! 

Being from Michigan, we are spoiled with craft beers from our fine state, but with that comes the desire to try other state's craft beer selection and D's had a solid selection of PA brews.  

For one, the beer cooler had a good sized selection, but it's all about the hundreds of warm beers they have in the back of the restaurant.  They have pretty much anything you want back there and it doesn't' matter that it's warm because they have a beer chiller where you can put your beers in there until optimal temperature.   It only takes about 7 minutes and they are good to go as well.  

Needless to say, this is another recommendation that I will pass on to all friends heading to Pittsburgh.  I'll spare the beer reviews as there's another app for that."}
{"text":"The beer cave is amazing, and you get $1 off each bottle if you take out... Which means that some of them end up being cheaper than if you bought a case! WOW. 

The food is really good. I have been here several times, and each time, I told the server to bring me something vegetarian. I have never been disappointed!! From hotdogs, to seitan, to nachos everything here tastes great and there are tons of options. 

The last time I was there we were having fun upstairs playing darts and racking up a tab. The bartender was nice enough to actually stop us and point out that it had started to snow, and we should probably leave before the roads got bad... I thought that was super sweet and nice of him!!"}
{"text":"Good: Food was good, came out extremely fast and was priced well.  My chicken salad was huge and everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food.  Staff was very nice and our server was fairly attentive to the table.  After our meal we ventured into the beer cave.  I pieced together a 6pack of various craft brews (all which were $1 if you are packing them to go) to take home.  Plenty of great offerings in the beer cave..almost everyone of my favorites were available.

Bad:  The place was pretty busy and didn't seem well organized.  If you're waiting for a table there's not really any place to stand while you wait.  Our server was often distracted and stopped in the middle of our order to talk with another server.  The layout isn't the greatest and staff often walked by and knocked into my chair as I ate.  When I rang out (I don't think they take your bill up...ours was presented and our server never came back?) the girl at the front started to ring up another couple behind me before I grabbed my 6 pack off the counter.

Verdict:  Again, everyone was super nice...maybe I just caught them on an off night and everyone was frazzled.  Either way..the food was good, the prices were good, and the people were cool.  I'll gladly go back if given the chance."}
{"text":"this is probably the best place to go get a six-pack of craft beer. the beer cave has thousands of bottles, and the walk-in cooler has a smaller but still VERY extensive collection. If you want your warmer beers from the cave chilled, there is a chilling station. All six-packs get a dollar-off per beer take-out as well. The ambience isn't as nice as, say, the sharp-edge, but the prices MORE than make up for it. ($4ish for a skulls splitter vs. $9.50 or $10 for example). 

Only complaint is that the bar gets noisy and the heat from the grille (behind the bar) can be a little intense in the summer. Couldn't be happier to live down the street from this gem! 

Oh yeah... the staff is great too."}
{"text":"D's is a Regent Square staple. While I live only 2 blocks away I actually don't come that often. I have to be in the mood for greasy fried food. They have a great beer cave and a good selection on draft. When I do come I typically order the chihuahua burger (veggie form). Its the perfect amount of spice kick. Love the cheese fries too! 
They do have a kids menu with a decent selection. Ordered my daughter the grilled chicken and applesauce. I was pleasantly surprised by it. 
On warmer days they open up the garage door and you get a nice breeze. The place just makes me yearn for summer."}
{"text":"This place is known for hotdogs and beers. I had the special of the day pulled pork dog. It's basically hotdog topped with pickle, cole slaw, and pulled pork. You can add additional toppings free of charge and as many as you like! I had avocado and mushrooms added to my hotdog. They have a lot of toppings to choose from. The price is very reasonable at about $5 and they have the veggie dog option, which is a plus. All these add on made the hotdog very good and their fries were good too."}
{"text":"D's does the chicago style hot dog very well, they even use sport peppers which I can never find in the grocery store. The bun is steamed and features the quintessential poppy seed exterior.

D's beer selection is also great but I'm not much of a beer drinker so it's not something I've ever focused on. The general consensus I've heard is that there is better selection elsewhere and the prices are a little high but you can't beat both their hot dogs and their beer selection at the same time, making them a great bar.

Their fries are so crispy that I suspect they're double fried. They're tasty and the toppings available can turn them into a bastard concoction of delicious, artery clogging glory. There's been nothing on D's menu that I've been disappointed with.

The service can be a little hit or miss due mostly to the sheer amount of business they do on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place is a must try. I would say it's a bar you can bring your kids to if you have any. The service is great the food is better. Me and my girlfriend got pub fires with cheese and bacon to share. I got the Angry tiki and Chili dog she got the Pot roast and Big Ben  all on beef franks. The food came out in no time and with a bill of only 35$ including a beer it was a great price. They also have a massive beer cave in the back. Next time I stop in here I have to bring a group of friends so we can all try one another's food."}
{"text":"Even if sometimes it can take a while to have a seat, the atmosphere you encounter is always rewarding. Staff is super-friendly, great selection of beers and their bites are among the best I've tried in Pittsburgh. Go for the Chihuahua or Bacon Cheddar dogs, jamaican jerk wings and French fries."}
{"text":"We LOVE D's!!!  We have been coming here for years and they are always consistent and fast.  Fantastic staff and owned by a wonderful family!"}
{"text":"Over-hyped food, rude service, don't care about their customers.  What happens when the owner values money over \"being there\" to oversee the business.  I'm a local and have been going to D's since they opened...but that doesn't matter any more....with the exception of Eli, the bartenders are generally rude.  Food is sub-par...seems the busier they are,  the worse the food is.  What a shame.  It used to be my \"go to\" place in the 'Square, where I would take out-of -towners or go after a mountain bike ride in Frick.  Despite the numbers of great beers, I can't justify giving my money to a place that doesn't care about their customers."}
{"text":"Everybody in my party had a good time! We love D's, had my going away party here. Thanks for the food and drinks and attention!

Dino was awesome! I hope there's people as nice as him in Louisville!"}
{"text":"Local rootbeer is always a win, and the hotdogs and pizza were no disappointment.

The jerk chicken wings, on the other hand...inedible.  Stick to the dogs and the za, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I go here a lot.  I think most folks who live in Regent Square/Swissvale/Edgewood area do too.  And it's probably not because the food is so utterly delicious.  It's because it's a groovy little place with young hipster (and some not so hipster) bartenders and waitresses that serves up an endless array of beers in a funky loud space.  I love Regent Square and always saw the potential for the grand old days of Hippy Free Love lying dormant in her quaint shops and family eateries ... until D's sprang to life in a former dry cleaner/gun shop space.  Oh yes, how the times have changed and we are all so thankful for it.  Big KUDOS to the D's Empire in Regent Square -- the Beer Distributor, D's Six Packs and Dogs, and the newest entrant Cibo!  Well done!  Stop on in for a nice hot pizza (I loved the Frickin Parker with meat balls and hot peppers but alas, it has been banished to the basement beer dungeon for-evah!) or a mediocre hotdog and languish in the beer heaven known simply as D's. They also have a smoky dark strange but intriguing (if you've had enough beer downstairs) bar upstairs now that serves alcohol."}
{"text":"Even though they were out of the first beers we asked for (the Dogfish Punkin) this place hit the spot for a junk food craving. Vegetarians: the veggie dog is awesome, not rubbery or pale but nearly mistakable for an actual hot dog. I ordered one with kraut and mustard, and my boyfriend braved the three-cheese dog, which was hard to pick up but looked tasty. Their fries were good, and were generously portioned (definitely shareable) for a $1.50 small. Next time, we'll delve more into their beer selection."}
{"text":"This place is great... 

The Food:
 They're known for their dogs and their beers and neither disappoint.  Their dogs are excellent and their fries are the perfect kind seasoning. 
They also offer vegan dogs! 

They have a beer cave with thousands (my guess) of beers. Organized by region and type etc. Very reasonably priced per bottle price as well as a chiller to cool your options. They also have a huge selection of drafts!
Great choice for a fancy 6-pack. 

The Staff:
The staff is a great mix of no-nonsense service and get what you ask for. Last I was there was for St. Patty's Day so it was super packed, but the service was still excellent. 
I was struggling with a bottle of almost-empty ketchup and my waiter literally came over and switched it out with a full bottle mid-squeeze. What a guy!
There was a wait but I we were sat very quickly, using a neat app they have!

The Ambience 
Has a dive bar feel with a cleaner up-keep. TVs already around for the sports aficionado.  
Definitely loud, with a \"bar\" side and a seating side. Still good for families, tho. 

Suggestions: Go on Thursdays - Great dogs and fries special."}
{"text":"Holy Balls and everything that is great in the world. These dogs are the real deal in Pittsburgh. I'm more of a natural casing kind of guy a little crunchy outside with a delicious juicy pork filled gem on the inside. So although these dogs didn't have the crisp I'm used to they were phenomenal. There were some crazy toppings that all looked ridiculously good. I got the mason dixon with chili and slaw, but the angry tiki was out of this world with bacon pineapple and a spicy hoisin sauce. Oh and by the way they have 1000 beers in their walkin cooler to pick from. This is a fine fine establishment."}
{"text":"The place is kind of small and disjointed a bit but they make up for it with their beer selection and great staff. The food is mostly bar food with a twist, offering cool toppings for regular sandwiches and burgers. The pizza was pretty good, and the bar area had plenty of tv's but lacked seating."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and friendly service. I enjoyed my kielbasa and the dining partners enjoyed their meal. There are options for vegetarians. It is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese dog is incredible.  This place is small and gets packed so be prepared for a long wait and no personal space."}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs (my favorite is the Chicago dog with the spicy polish dog on a wheat bun)!!! 

They also have a beer cave with over 1000 beers!"}
{"text":"While everyone goes here for the dogs, the pizza is not be ignored. Hand tossed crusts with a nice selection of specialty pizzas. 

Appetizers are good as well. Hummus is a solid choice. Not a fan of their wings. 

Beer selection is on point and if you can't find what you want on tap, head into the beer cave. I like that you can find a crazy variety and try new beers. Always busy, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Ds is awesome. There isn't anything here that I don't like. Service is wonderful. Decor is interesting and comfortable. Food is always perfect and has ton of vegetarian options to choose from. I'm so thankful I can have a delicious (veggie) Chicago dog again. 

They have a massive beer selection in which you can pick a bottle from their beer cave or cooler. They also have a full bar and great draft beer options on draft. 

So again, Ds is great and should be visited if you like beer and/hotdogs."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because it's so close to my house, but they just keep disappointing me.

First of all, the veggie dogs are greasy and don't taste any better than the frozen Morningstar ones you buy at Giant Eagle. Fries are nothing special. And my order has been wrong (either missing a topping or with extra toppings I did not want) every time I've been here. And it's expensive for what it is. Ridiculous to pay $40+ for four hot dogs and soft drinks (no alcohol included).

It's also so loud in the restaurant that it is pointless to even try to talk to your dining companions.

The worst part, though, is the service.  You practically have to beg the waitresses to pay any attention to you. And I don't even mean refilling your drink. I mean to put your order in in the first place, and to pay your bill. 

Go to Franktuary. It's a million times better in every way."}
{"text":"This place is great! As a vegan and not a huge fan of beer, I wasn't expecting much for me there from D's name...but the service, food, and atmosphere was all so, so good!

I was excited to try their cauliflower wings, but it turned out that they have now switched over to seitan. Even so, the two different orders my friends and I shared were both very tasty, although very fried and crunchy, compared to the meatier seitan wings served up elsewhere in Pittsburgh.

Their vegan dog on a poppy seed bun comes with unlimited toppings, for just 4.99! They somehow managed to get avocado, grilled onions, tomato, pickle spears, brown mustard, and banana peppers stacked into mine, and it was delicious and filling. I'd love to see a homemade vegan dog instead of using Yve's, but the toppings deal makes it worth it!

Definitely will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"D's is a true hidden gem in Pittsburgh offering amazing hot dogs and a room of over 1000 different beers. Who could possibly ask for more? The Hot dog list is giant and offers pretty much any hot dog with unlimited toppings for $5.60 and i'm not talking just ketchup and mustard. D's dogs offer everything from Mac and Cheese, chili, avocado, peppers, sriracha slaw etc etc. They also offer an extensive menu of Pizza,Subs,Wings, Burgers and Salads.

Apart from their many beers on tap D's also has a large backroom filled to the brim with over 1000 different types of beer. The beer is separated into different regions of the country/world. This is one of the only places that I have found random imports that are not commonly found at your local distributor. The Beer is a tad pricey but you do get 20% off a take out order when not drinking in.

Overall D's is a great place for friends and families to have a nice bite to eat and a delicious beer while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Our favorite dive bar in Pittsburgh.
Set on the quaint Neighborhood of regent square you can usually find a table pretty easily and at most have 30 minute wait during peak times.

Fast friendly service with the best hot dogs and beers on tap in town. Their beer cave is so much fun (over 1000 beers) and if you buy to go you get $1 off each beer. I've come shopping in the cave for presents for beer lovers.

Lastly this is a vegetarian haven. they have veggie dogs and burgers with the most creative and delicious toppings. My go to is the veggie dog with the angry tiki (hoison sauce with pineapple, I skip the bacon) on a poppy seed bun.

Fries are also epic- usually a handful of fries is enough for two to share. We love them so much we have gotten takeout of just fries before!

Staff are always friendly despite the busy and controlled chaos."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Excellent beer selection.   The best fries in town, and dogs that will blow your mind.  If I'm leaving my neighborhood, it's likely to go to D's!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Delicious hot dogs (I am loyal to the mac & cheese topped hot dog - judge me, I don't care) & the most incredible fries around. I live in Regent Square & I'm thrilled to have a local go-to place for a quick dinner & a beer for very reasonable prices. They often have a $5 dog & fries lunch special that I gratefully take advantage of. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm over it. 

Too many instances of bad service. Though that one woman who I have seen working there for a long time is solid. But going back to what I started with; seems like the inmates are running the prison these days. 

The beer to-go costs more here than it does in New York City or Brooklyn. Think about that people.

(The Monroeville location is better, imo.)"}
{"text":"D's has been hovering among my Pittsburgh bookmarks for a couple of years now, so I was happy to finally stop by for a visit and late lunch recently. After squeezing into a parallel parking spot out front, I had two things on my mind when walking in here: hotdogs and beer, both of which they have down pat.

Since it was mid-afternoon, few tables were filled, but the front patio was open to allow in some fresh air during the nice day. I first looked around at their extensive beer selections; \"six pax\" in the rear \"Beer Cave\" and individual bottles in the middle cooler. I found something to my liking and grabbed a high table and menu.

A \"Big Ben\" dog sounded appetizing (and mildly appropriate), but I ended up going with the \"Mason Dixon\" topped with chili and coleslaw. Knowing that one dog would not be enough, I also went with a small order of their \"Pub Fries\" covered in cheese and bacon. (Forgive me Father, for I have no restraint.)

Holy Moley! Both the dog and fries were excellent and down right tasty. Thank God because my satisfied stomach was smacking down the guilty part of my brain that was subconsciously calculating the summation of calories shared between the meal and two bottles of liquid refreshment.

Oh well. I definitely heart D's, even if my heart now hates me in return. 4.5 Stars."}
{"text":"D's is a typical bar food type of place.  It's size makes it cozy and in general it has a nice, happy ambience.  The food is nothing spectacular but not bad as well - even though the hot dogs are pretty good.  It has a large selection of drafts and there is also a back \"room\" where you can buy pretty much any beer that exists either for taking it to your home or for having it with your dinner.  The service was fast and helpful.  I am sure I will be visiting this place again in the future but just do not expect something spectacular."}
{"text":"Their chicken BBQ pizza is among the greaseiest I've ever consumed, but their beer selection is good, atmosphere is pleasant, and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs.  Great beers on tap.  I always fill up on way too much beer and way too much food when I'm here because it's all so good.  I would recommend anything on the menu.

And who wouldn't love the Beer Cave?  They have an amazing selection of beers to go.  It can sometimes be overwhelming.  But I like having so many choices.  

The wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites because it's so convenient, and there's an awful lot to like. My favorite dishes are the Big Ben Hot Dog or the Balboa Chicken Sandwich, and the beer selection is fantastic. We've also started to get our pizzas here, and they're quite good."}
{"text":"My three stars are for the decor, wow so much to see! There was a giant mural on the wall to the left of our table with just about every iconic figure from Kermit the Frog, to Einstein really it was a sight to see. My little sister, little bro and I had a blast playing where's Waldo, while we waited for our order's to be taken. The  decor and wall murals were about the most interesting thing about our dining experience.

For a meal for 3 people I spent $50 ouch that's a little high for a hotdog shop and something I wasn't expecting such a high bill.

The kiddies did enjoy their meals, we got cheese and chili fries, a mason Dixon dog, a red alert dog,  two beef dogs with mustard and ketchup, two drafts of pumpkin ale(for me) and a Philly cheese steak. 

The dogs are  bigger than average, but the chili tasted like your standard chili from a can, I was hoping that with the price tag of $5.00 a dog the chili would have more character. 

My little bro proclaimed at the end of his meal, \"I'm full, I've never  been full off of two hotdogs!\"

I'll do anything to put a smile on kids face, even though the food fell flat, the restaurant was fun and we smiled laughed and jokes through a rather mediocre meal."}
{"text":"A neighborhood staple. You can't go wrong with any of their hot dogs. My personal favorite is the Angry Tiki. I also think their wings are top notch. After eating dinner, The Loft (bar located upstairs) is a great spot for an after dinner drink or to watch a sports game."}
{"text":"D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy, fun, casual place to get some good eats and a nice beer. As a vegetarian who still likes to pretend to eat meat, I so appreciate their multiple veggie options. Nearly any item on the menu can be made in a vegetarian version. Their special dogs (dog of the month) are usually a lot of fun. My favorite was the Thanksgiving dog back in November, with corn, mashed potatoes, cranberry, and stuffing. It was amazing! I came twice to have one in November. 

Their beer list has to be the best I've seen in the city. Lots of great stuff on tap and a huge bottle room. 

Since we like to bring our toddler to dine with us, I'm always so happy that they are so friendly and accommodating with kids. He loves their mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, though I think he likes their crayons more.

For a fun family dinner, a good beer, watching a game, getting together with friends, or just experimenting with a new Belgian brew, I strongly recommend D's."}
{"text":"Everyone is so nice, tons of different beers to choose from, including a mix your own 6 pack deal and, just 3 words, Mason Dixon Dog!"}
{"text":"I love D's! My roommate and I are happy regulars at both the restaurant and the attached beer cave, and we like to drag our out-of-town friends here as well. This place is honestly one of the best things about living in Regent Square. The staff are friendly and efficient and the food is always hot and fresh. The beer is of course outstanding. What more could you want in a neighborhood bar?"}
{"text":"The most amazing food ever! Had the blue cheese burger and sweet potato fries and it was best I ever had!! Even the ranch was out of this world ! Service was amazing! Courteous and so friendly !!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"good selection of beers*, but the food is appalling. sysco-truk curly fries and run-of-the-mill hotdogs that don't even have natural casings. puh-leez. if you're gonna put \"dogz\" in the name of your restaurant at least try to serve something better than what you can get on sale at giant eagle. 

no joke: I prefer the O. their fries are made out of potatoes and their dogs have real casings. 

* and by \"good\" I mean \"good for PA\" where liquor laws are an absurd kafkaesque mess and a lindeman's geuze is about as interesting as it gets (for like $15, natch)"}
{"text":"It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  The idea that they would just sell you hot dogs and six-packs is so just and pure it almost makes me want to weep.  

I went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish, kraut, and brown mustard.  Both were excellent dogs, and their beer list is incredible.  

Again, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes off as real?  If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off as a gimmick.  Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood place with a twist.  A coronary twist.  So good....."}
{"text":"D's is just one of those places I love going to. I can't get enough of picking out my own 6 pack of wonderfulness. All amazing beer. The food has never let me down. The service has always been good. This place is just awesome."}
{"text":"Like hot dogs? Like beers?.. then you'll like D's 6-pack and dogs you'll get a big variety of things here... from great dogs, great wings, great food in general ,wide variety of beers on tap or on shelf or in cooler... (warm&cold) 6-packs to-go... and great waiting staff...  for being a small but great shop in Swissvale... always busy but that only means their doin things right.... great food and beverage"}
{"text":"While I'm not much of a beer fan, I appreciate that this place would appeal to both the beer snob and the casual drinker. Enormous selection of beers in the Cave as well as on tap. They have Arsenal Cider, which makes me very happy (although I wish they carried the Bone-Dry). 

The hot dogs and fries are amazing. I had an Angry Tiki. It sounded like an odd combination - pineapple, hoisin sauce, and bacon on a hot dog - but it was delicious. The only thing I might change next time is asking for a side of Sriracha (would have put this hot dog over the top). 

It's cheap, it's a good set-up for going with a group, and I will definitely take any of my beer-loving friends here."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way home after a mild morning hike at Frick Park. We had our pup in the car so we put in a to-go order. The staff was really friendly and quite accommodating. We were invited to check out the Beer Cave while we waited and their selection does not disappoint. Having just moved to PGH from San Diego, we appreciated the craft staples from Stone, Ballast Point and Mission that they had on hand. I wish they could get a couple of Lost Coast, Mother Earth and Shiner varieties in there since they are some of my favorites. 

As for the dogs, we had the Chicago and the Angry Tiki. The Chicago was delicious and something I would definitely order again. My husband had the Angry Tiki and said that it seemed to have too much going on, but he ate all of it and thought it was still quite tasty. We also ordered a side of D's Chips and were offered a choice of sauce to dip them in. I declined but am thinking now it would have been better to take a sauce. The chips were good, don't get me wrong... But if you're offered sauce, go for the sauce! You don't have to use it, right?

We will definitely be back. Hopefully on a Saturday again so that we can go for a Bloody Mary and buy a 6-pack to go."}
{"text":"D's is a neighborhood classic. They're known for the hot dogs, pizza, and bottle beer selection. I'd say they are like Primanti's. They're typically good, but not a place to take foodies (Franktuary would be the foodie hot dog joint).

The hot dogs are pretty good. If you look at the pictures, it's primarily hot dogs. The french frie servings are huge (but not Oakland O huge). Pizza is good. I'd recommends staying aware from the other options. I haven't been impressed with the hoagies and wings.

As a note, be careful with some of the bottles. I've had some old ones on occasion when I've picked some of the odder selections. That being said, this would be my pick for a bottle bar. They don't have the massive Belgian selection that is Sharp Edge, but the service is 10x better."}
{"text":"There's no wrong way to eat a hot dog.  Especially if it's topped with cheese, fries and coleslaw.

Imagine if you will me sitting there and a myriad of punctuation marks pop up over my head as if I were in a cartoon.  My puzzlement showing because I have no sure shot way of how to accomplish eating this masterfully prepared awesomeness just sat down in front of me.  Or maybe it was because I wasn't sure I wanted to attack my Big Ben first or the pub fries I decided to order on the side.  My mind was buzzing...or maybe that could  have been the raspberry ale I chosen from the beer cave prior to me sitting down.  

To say this hot dog is good is an insult to D's.  You better be prepared to say this hot dog is delicious, out of this world, life altering.......and maybe even orgasmic :O  The mixture of the poppy seed bun, coleslaw, fries, cheese, and beefy goodness....heaven.  Pub fries, pub fries, oi, Oi, OI!  Some of the best fried up taters I've ever had.  And to put some cheesy goodness on there was amazing.  But the best part was the cooked oh so right bacon that kind of melted in your mouth.  Sounds salty, no?  That's what the ranch is for.

I have no idea why I waited so long to try this place out, I should be shunned for this.  If you are to shun me, shun me back to the beer cave, there are still several other beers I would love to try.

The wait staff kind of remind you of worker bees.  Always in motion, always doing something, and very attentive.

In all honesty, I really wish I could give this place more than five stars."}
{"text":"This is a Regent Square establishment and a fun place to watch a game, have a drink and most importantly have a hot dog.  Very friendly bartenders and wait staff.  The menu sports a variety of simple to gourmet hot dogs along with other items.  They have several TV's mounted for viewing of games at the bar and they have loyal locals who frequent the bar.  Outdoor seats are nice for a sunny day.  Be sure to ask about hot dog specials!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! they serve a selection of creatively topped dogs and some of the best greasy fries I have had in awhile. enough said!  Time to go drink some beer and devour this dog!"}
{"text":"Service here is spotty at best, but the food keeps bringing me back! About 25 unique beers on tap.  I like the Chicago Burger, with a side of ever so crispy fries.  If you are in the mood for great dogs, a burger and a few beers, this is the place to go.  If they could only get the service down."}
{"text":"Crowded bar atmosphere, spectacular beer selection, good bar food.  Great hot dogs."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Pittsburgh for our 4 year anniversary. After eating out for two days we were about to head home but decided to stop here on the way. So glad we did! After having sub par service for the past 2 days the guy waiting on us was great! He checked on us often and the food was so good. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Also found some great beers in the beer cave (some that I've been trying to find for awhile now). Will definitely go back here if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously average food with above average prices. The waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves. I'm wondering if a prerequisite to work here is to feel that you're better than others because you know all the Belgium beers."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. A robust selection of beers on tap, and literally a thousand different beers in bottles - this place is half bar/restaurant, half beer warehouse. But the drink selection might not even be the best part, as the food here was awesome. I went with the Chicago Dog for a modest four bucks, and it was as good as any I'd ever had - perfectly grilled dog, all the right high-quality toppings and a fresh-tasting bun. The pub fries sealed the deal though - a huge pile of fries with generous helpings of perfectly-melted cheese and just-soft-enough-just-crispy-enough bacon. My friend and I could have shared the large order of Pub Fries and been just fine. I saw someone's sandwich across the bar, and it was truly enormous - I could come here with a friend and for ten bucks, get my fill of sandwich, fries and beer for the rest of the day. Great value, great experience!!"}
{"text":"Love D's! I've tried about four of their hot dogs, some wings, their fries and pizza.  Everything is great! Despite it always being packed, I've managed to grab a table there without waiting (at least so far!) Service has always been quick and their beer selection can't be beat.  

Are there cheaper places to get a beer in the Burgh? Absolutely. But if you are coming here lookin' for $2 cans of PBR, this isn't the place for you. Unfortunately it's just a bit out of the way for me to come in here just for a mixed six pack unless there's something really special that I'm looking for."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed D's yet?? I moved away from Pittsburgh over 5 years ago and EVERY time I come to town, I go to D's. I can't stay away from the awesomeness that is the large walk in fridge of specialty bottled beers or the take away section in the back where you can grab all kinds of good beers you want. Oh and they have a little quick chiller for the warm beers you grab in the back so you can drink them right away :-)

The food! Ok, I love the veggie dogs on the bun just plain, but I've been rockin' some of the specialty ones lately. I highly recommend the Chihuahua with jalapenos and avocado, or the Mac n' cheese, with...well, mac and cheese. The housemade root beer is also divine. It's perfectly sweet and refreshing. 

This isn't diet food people! There are far too many (oh so lovely) temptations at D's. Splurge and get the cheese fries to share. A small is good for 2 or 3 people and perfect with hotdogs.

Once you get a table, sit back, relax and enjoy the goods.You won't regret it.  D's is definitely not a rush-in, rush-out sort of place."}
{"text":"Everyone knows about D's right? It's the place in Regent Square where you can buy 1000 different kinds of beers for all over the place by the bottle. Such a nice selection to choose from and you can even make your own six pack to take home with you. The also of course have hotdogs and many different kinds (or you can create your own). You can pick the kind of dog as well as what toppings it has (and there are a lot).

There are three sections to this place, the bar, the restaurant, and the beer cave. I've bene to all three and they are all worth a visit, especially the beer cave!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the run-down exterior- this is a genuine beer hall that would make do nicely in any town in Europe. The decor is nothing to write home about, but the food is great. The dogs come in all varieties (bratwurst, all beef, turkey dog, veggie dog) and you can mix and match any topping your heart desires. Prices are SO reasonable, especially at a time when it's tough to find great food for a reasonable price in this city. The best feature of D's is their beer cave to the rear of the restaurant. While your dinner companions peruse the menu, make sure you stop and take a good walk through their beer selection. You can pick from hundreds of domestic and imported beers from around the world, including some rare gems you'd have to special order anywhere else. Chill your beer there in minutes, or get a discount walking in and bringing home a single or six pack. They always have interesting offerings on tap as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect final stop of our Pgh tour, but could throw you into decision fatigue. The beer cave is fantastic, and has something for everyone--but so many decisions! The dogs are good, and they let you go completely crazy on the toppings if you want to--but again, all the decisions!  

I threw myself head-first into the beer-cave-and-topping fracas and have no regrets, but I also respect my cousin's strategy, sticking to their tap list and pre-made topping suggestions. Whatever your approach, get the sweet potato waffle fries, which are nothing short of amazing.  

They have a number of gluten free beers and ciders, and will wrap your dog in a corn tortilla instead of a bun, but the grill and oil are all shared, so cross contamination is possible. Also, the fries are beer battered, so stick to the sweet potato fries if you're GF."}
{"text":"Great local place with simple concept well executed. Want a beer. Want a hotdog stand. Want social. Want a neighborhood joint feel. Yes, even if Regent Square isn't your neighborhood. D's is all that. Service, food, beer all adequate. None of them individually a reason to go. Or collectively, come to think of it. I go when I want simple and easy. Have had a few meetings there."}
{"text":"Went there and checked in with Yelp and waited awhile (not too bad actually, stood at the bar and caught the tail end of happy hour -- half price drafts!), was then told there were 14 parties ahead of us on the app, went back to check with the hostess who seated us immediately -- she said she wasn't checking the app? Weird. Anyway, the service was pretty mediocre. I think the food at D's is pretty good but I think the hot dogs are overpriced, I mean $5.60 a hot dog is kind of ridiculous especially when you consider most people are ordering multiple hot dogs and apps/sides. I do recommend the \"Angry Tiki\" dog, it's the best! It'd be nice if they had some multi-dog deals? Definitely a great beer selection though, the cave is impressive."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at D's. The beer cave was amazing! I'm not a fan of beer but can appreciate a vast selection. I went straight for the cider. The lively energy of this place was incontestable. No frills, down-to-earth place where you can kick it back with a beer (or in my case a cider) and enjoy company with friends. It was a perfect ending to our movie night at the Regent Square Theater. With smiles planted on our faces after watching a dark comedy, going to D's only extended our happy mood. Before leaving I went back to the beer cave for more cider. Good stuff, good stuff!"}
{"text":"I don't know many girls that don't like Ds and Six Pax and Dogz. Some will only admit to liking Dogz, whereas others admit to liking Siz Pax and Dogz but not Ds. However the truth is, most girls like all three. But here's a secret. Most boys do too. Especially this boy. (tosses hair). Hi stud.

What to get: Chicago Dog
Why: Because it's really overpriced and who doesn't like giving money away
What?: Nah but really though it's a good dog for sure.

So when I'm being charged $6 for what Chicago locals will charge you $3 for (and make better, usually), I'm all ready to give a 3 star review. The wait time was about 10 minutes for my dog (but they said it'd be 20), the place was packed wall to wall with families and drinkers and diners and socialites (if Pitt has socialites) and barflys and kids and did I mention kids, but there was a surprising lack of hot Pittsburgh girls (Pitt has spectacular women!), maybe because hot dogs aren't really a hot girl thing? I have no idea. The crowd was definitely a sausage fest, though. Both literally and figuratively.

Service was okay, I did appreciate that they managed to find me in the mess of people to give it to me. My hot dog, I mean. What did you think I meant. And the decor in here is pretty awesome, from their massive \"beer room\" to their \"grimy bar that isn't really grimy\" look. I think it's a well done place that will appeal to people with sausages (or who love sausages - the kind you bite into without anyone screaming, except vegans perhaps), and I like it.

I do not like the prices at all, but the Chicago dog was so surprisingly enjoyable and well done and good (though not the most \"authentic\" but who needs authentic when it tastes fantastic, really), that although I would rather pay 3-4 than 6 for this thing, I still have to give it a 5 stars because it's too good of a hot dog to give it less.

Be careful getting in and out of the place. The cars on the street outside drive way too fast for such a public and busy area, and between all the drunk people and narrow lanes and parked cars and high speeds with complete idiots who have probably been drinking and are driving through a sea of bar-goers and families trying to get into Ds and other places, accidents could easily happen out here, especially crossing the street.

Speaking of crossing the street, if any boys are reading this and wanna check out my Chicago dog, hmu."}
{"text":"Made my first trip to D's today.  By far one of the best bars I have been to.  Great atmosphere, good food for a bar, and how can I not mention the BEER CAVE.  They have an impeccable selection of brew.  Great place to go for a night out or just to have a good time.  I would imagine a Stiller game would be pretty fun to watch.  The prices are just right including drinks, but if only we could do something about the county drink tax.  

I will visit this place frequently."}
{"text":"Love this Regent Square gem.   It's always bustling and although the seating is a little tight, it seems right for the style of the place.  The food is always delicious.   My favorite is the Chihuahua dog which has cheddar cheese, jalapenos, and avocado cream sauce.  I usually order a side of sweet potato fries or mac and cheese so that I am not tempted to order a second dog (how exactly that works out in my mind...don't ask me).   The house wine is what you'd expect from a beer joint, but it's drinkable and not ridiculously price.   The service has a diner feel to it, but they usually get it right."}
{"text":"What a fun place! We saw this place featured on Man Vs Food, and decided to drive up to Pittsburgh on a rainy Sunday to feast. We saw at the bar and had some awesome beers and tried the Mason Dixon, The Mac and Cheese and The Tiki, we loved them all. The Mason Dixon was my personal fave and my guy's fave was The Tiki. We got our food fast, and the bartenders were all super friendly and attentive. We loved getting our carb on here!"}
{"text":"This really is a great place. It's hard to find fault with anything here! Great owner, superb bar food, and oh, the huge selection of craft beer. And I'm not talking about the massive collection in the beer cave!! The commitment to have 5 or 6 local brews (Helltown included) on tap in a rotating  \"local\" draft corner is music to my ears. Had Helltown's Reaper Harvest Ale last night and it was fabulous. I've had quite a few local brews here as well as a selection of other crafts. I love having exciting draft beer choices!

The food is really good too! Wings, dogs, veggie dogs...these aren't just your typical ballpark quality dogs. Nah, these are amazing. The buns, the all beef dog with that welcome \"snap\" when you bite it...yum. Plus the selection of options will keep you coming back to try more and more. The daily specials are worth watching - the 10 wings for $5 on Monday is a bargain!!

Since they don't serve cheapo food or beer, the price reflects that. 2 draft beers and 2 hotdogs  is close to $25. But hey, enjoy it. The crowd is cool, the atmosphere is terrific, and the beer selection is among the best in the city. I'll keep coming back. For sure!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve \"bar food\", but there's a nice variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. My favorite items on the menu are the veggie dogs, pizza, and soft pretzels. 

You can't beat their beer selection. Make sure to visit the beer cave while you are there and their section of take-out beer for an even larger selection."}
{"text":"Any bar and/or restaurant that has \"D's Nutz\" on their menu is great-grand-wonderful in my opinion. 

Let's start with the beer. Say hello to barley-pop heaven here folks. Over 1,000 different types of brews? Holy--I thought I blacked out for a second. You take a stroll into either a walk-in cooler or a backroom lined with every beer under the sun, pick what you want and toss it into the complimentary cooler. This nifty little guy chills your bottle to whatever your desired temp is, fast! We're talking like 3-5 minutes. If it were just for the insanely intricate brew selection, D's would be a 5'er star, period.

Now, let's move on to some serious dog biz-nas. This place was recommended to me from a frank-lovin' Pittsburgh-ite as the best place in town to grab one. Welp, I ordered my very first Chicago-style hotdog and was not disappointed. In fact, holy-fantastic-hot-peppers! The toppings were all so delish and blended perfectly with the dog. It was cooked just right on the outside, inside and served up with a freshly steamed bun. Yum. We also skipped the fries and enjoyed a baked, soft pretzel instead. This thing was fluffy, chewy and delectable. 

The only thing I would ask for more of is maybe a heftier frank. Don't get me wrong--everything was beyond delicious. I just noticed there wasn't much meatiness involved, and with all those topping options you want the hot dog to stand out too. 

Besides that, the atmosphere, help and general vibe of this little joint was spot-on. If you're in the 'Burgh, you must stop by D's. Seriously."}
{"text":"When I go to heaven, they will have a Sephora with D's Six Pax's Beer Cave in the back.  And I will be happy.

I LOVE this place!  I'd love to take my beer loving father here but i'm afraid his heart would give out with excitement.  If its a good brew, it lives here!  I FREAKING LOVE this place.  Can you tell I'm enthusiastic about it?  I recommend you dine here.

The food is good, I like the black and blue burger, but they have just about any kind of hotdog combination you can dream up.  I really love that you can walk back into the beer cave and pick out your beer, and they offer cool chillers for it.

Here's the best hike in Pittsburgh:  Hike in Frick Park.  take the Falls Ravine trail until you come out near the bridge.  Walk across the bridge.  At Ryan's Pub, turn right and walk straight ofr awhile.  You'll come to D's Six Pack and Dogs.  You will be READY for a beer, bc its a hike.  But that is the point of hiking.  Eat delicious food and drink beer.  Call a friend to come pick you up and take you home.  The End.

In fact, its a damn shame they dont offer a gift registry.  Because I would register for beer.  I would.  No judgement."}
{"text":"Great! Had a great time and good drinks! Awesome service!! Yummy food too! I recommend anyone in the area goes!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try D's Six Pax and Dogs. But from the moment my friend and I walked in on a Friday at lunch time, we were kind of bummed.  We sat down at the bar, and the bartender refused to even acknowledge us, let alone serve us.  So we switched to the other side of the space.

The service on the other side was better but a tad slow.  I started with the macaroni and cheese ($3.00).  It was just doctored Kraft mac and cheese, with a bit too much salt, but for the price is was reasonable and good.  I ordered a Chicago dog ($5.50), and the hot dog was an all star for the most part.  It was an authentic Chicago style dog, and the toppings were fantastic.  My friend ordered a Big Ben hot dog, and it was pretty gross.  The cheese picked up the vinegar-y taste from the coleslaw, and it made the cheese taste sour.  Not appetizing at all.  

D's grills their hot dogs, which is normally fine.  However, both my friend and my dogs came out very burnt.  One of hers was literally inedible, and these hot dogs are pricey.  The server did not say anything about the practically untouched hot dog and just took it off of the table.

They do have some daily or lunch specials for cheaper hot dogs so check that out.

The verdict?  I would come back here for a Chicago dog and ask them to boil it to prevent the risk of a singed dog, and I would return for the beer cave."}
{"text":"I thought D's was beer mecca of Western PA until i recently discovered House Of A Thousand Beers. The latter is a bit of a drive, but you won't see anything like it in the area. That being said, I stopped in Ds today and i must say the cave is slowly but surely going down hill. They use to have countless hard to find beers, Ottos, etc. Hardly saw any of that today. And what specialty beers they do have costs an arm and a leg, and can be found for cheaper elsewhere. For example, $14 for a 12 oz bottle of Wulver and $25 for a bottle of Angel Share! Whoever is actually subjecting themselves to those outrageous prices are literally getting robbed. You can find a $25 four pack of Wulver and a $10 single of Angel Share at Giant Eagle.. In fact, you can find most of the beers in the cave at Giant Eagle at a much lower price... Shop smart and mix and match a sixer at Giant Eagle for half the price."}
{"text":"I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D's, but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers, and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really, really good. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off, but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts, but to each his own. He had a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it. 
The beer cave is awesome. 
I'd love to give D's five stars, but like a couple of people mentioned, the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly, but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay, and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills, too. The dining area and the bar are separated, and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though."}
{"text":"OK,  this is a place to get beer and the food is secondary.However service still  matters and the service on my visit today leaves a lot to be desired. First the food. Great Chicago dogs with all the fixings but so so Cuban dog with underwhelming toppings.Perhaps it was because their fryer was out but the toppings on the Cuban dog seemed to be out of a plastic pack from Giant  Eagle.The beer was fine a Belgian ale, probably the best part of my experience. The first server I had did get me a second glass of beer but although I asked for a menu never got back to me to see what I wanted to order.Eventually another server did and I ordered.So if you want a beer definitely come on over and for some of the hot dogs you'll be fine but if you want consistent service forget it
This is the ultimate in bro style  service best suited to half loaded  college students or anyone with low expectations of service at a bar and grill."}
{"text":"I got some cheesy bacon fries and a corn dog, and although my meal was quite scrumptious and satisfying, I kind of feel that this place is overpriced when compared to a lot of other similar places that I have been to (Happy Dog in Cleveland, Dirty Franks in Columbus, Packs and Dogs in Mt Washington, etc).  I loved my Arsenal Cider House Fighting Elleck that they had (which I have to say had us venture over to Larryville and go get a few growlers for home).  The service is great, love the laid back vibe.  Only reason no 5 stars, is the overall cost when compared to similar places."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the food is always super tasty. Their specialty hot dogs are amazing, and they make great fries. I've liked everything I've had there. I also appreciate their extensive draft and bottle beer selection. They even have a fun chiller if you pick one off the shelf. Be sure to check out their daily specials, as you can get some great deals!"}
{"text":"Favourite local spot. Amazing fries. Specials are worth it. The beer cave is unique and fun to explore. And the decor is interesting; you notice something different each time you go."}
{"text":"My friend and I come here often on Sunday nights and sit at the bar. Great draft beer selection and consistently good food. My favorite things to get are: the Cuban dog, fries with cheese on the side, and plain wings with sauce on the side (so much better this way IMO). The guys who work here are all super nice and very attentive."}
{"text":"Tourist perspective:
The beers were flowing here. Dozens of microbrews that I need to get to know better as well as Guinness, black and tans, and Unibroue Terriblé...a 10.5% ABV, 12 oz challice of dark strong flavorful brew.  Pints are $5-8 depening on how obscure a beer you are ordering.  But there is crazy selection.  Try something different. 

Did you know, in this town....and I guess in this state, you don't buy your beer in the grocery store?  You gotta go to spots like this for a sixer.  If you need a beer, pint or to-go, this is an effin' cool spot. mix and match a sixer.

We tried a bunch of dogs, wings and beers.  

The crew here managed to keep our glasses full even though it was packed on st. patrick's day.

We tried a few dogs: the mac and cheese brat (with bacon)....really! bacon, mac n cheese on an effin' hotdog, a bacon cheddar brat and something called the mason-dixon, which was french fries & coleslaw on a dog.  All the dogs were good eats.  You can get your order vienna, veggie, turkey, cheese brat, or on a spicy dog.  The dogs arrive well grilled with a little bit of crisp blackening going on.  There are a shit load of additional toppings you can request (avacado, bacon, various mustards, saurkraut, etc.) and they seemed to be free...at least we didn't get charged anything additional .....Everything was included in the dog prices.

Wings were ok.  We did dry wings: jerk, spicy ranch, and parmesean.  They were all decently meaty.  The parmeseans with a side of the spicy mayo were good stuff, distinct flavor and good for dipping.  The other flavors of dry wings were ok. Mostly just salty, but ok."}
{"text":"D's the the best!  The food is great, the beer is plentiful, and the staff are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Any place that has a walk-in fridge full of beer gets my vote.  Go visit the beer cave!

D's is one of those places I need to go to every time I'm back in town visiting family.  I usually go for a burger or wings (seriously I need to find good wings in LA...) and beer.  The food is always tasty and the service is excellent.  

Regent Square is a really cute little area that has a ton of great bars and restaurants.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. I live down the street and find myself going here often. The burgers are awesome and cheap - you can add all sorts of toppings (avocado, bacon) for no charge. I also recently tried a turkey hot dog which was much better than expected (I'm not a big hot dog person). It was topped with coleslaw and chili, and super flavorful. In addition, my sister is a vegetarian and loves the vegetarian burgers, hot dogs and wings. Overall a good choice for casual bar food."}
{"text":"Ive been wanting to try Ds forever & I'm so thankful that we randomly decided to. I mean beer & hot dogs? how genius. 

our server was super friendly. he was also very knowledgeable on beers when my bf asked for suggestions. After hearing it was our first time and we were a little confused on how/where to get beer, he offered to help us pick some out that he and other patrons enjoy. 

Somehow bobby and i both ordered a chili cheese dog as well as a bacon cheddar. We shared a *small* cheese fry which was huge. Bobby took the servers suggestion of blue point's toasted lager. I tried it and it wasnt bad (im not a dark beer person) Our dogs were huge as well. We each ended up taking one home.

After our meal we headed to both the cooler and beer cave area. The variety was endless! I wasn't familar with too many of the breweries, but i was excited to just get some and try them out. I ended up only choosing 2 of Hofbrahaus' Hefe Weizen (my fav!!!!) Bobby picked out 4 others that i will try. They had soooo many different options. I was excited to find beers from Hofbrahaus & Fat Heads. how cool."}
{"text":"This place is really cute, and great to go for their Beer Room, where you can make your own six-pack. I did not enjoy the bar's chicken wings very much, but definitely a great place to try some unique beers and yell at your friends over the general hubbub."}
{"text":"D's has the best Chicago style hot dog in Pittsburgh. Whenever I come here, I usually get 2 of their Chicago dogs and a couple orders of chili fries when I'm with a bunch of people. The best part of D's is their beer cave. It is packed with beers all over the world. This was the only place I could find Perkuno's Hammer before it got retired. You can find bottles of literally anything here. The best part is that you can grab a 6-pack and just fit any 6 beers in it to go or have them for the table."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and I couldn't be more pleased with my experience. We sat downstairs in the dining area, on the same side where they keep all their beers. We were seated immediately and our server was quick to greet us. My boyfriend and I each ordered a draft beer. He had an IPA by Sierra Nevada and I had the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter. Both were awesome and their draft list is decent. About 15-20 craft beers on tap. 

We each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical bar food, definitely more interesting items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalapeños. It was amazing! Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan of) but I was able to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing, they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting to me. Overall the price isn't bad either which was awesome. After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome selection.. Over 1,000 beers in their beer room (all beers are warm) but they do also have a cooler which has less beers but still not a bad selection. 

I honestly couldn't be happier with my experience."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you're in the 'burgh. This small joint expanded in the last year. great dogs and a huge selection of beer, imported and otherwise. Service has always been decent and better. Sports agames are often on the TV so get ready for that. Atmosphere is pretty neat- there's a weird mural in the larger seating area that's worth a peek and a air duct in top of the room that's cleverly painted like a wooden beam- can't get over that. I am a fan. Go here- then go catch a movie at Regent Square theater up the street."}
{"text":"CM and I visited D's yesterday (Sat.) at around 7pm for dinner.  Given that CM lives right around the corner, and that I had a City Dining Card, D's had been on our list for awhile, and we were eager to check it out. We happened to arrive right when the Kentucky Derby was in full swing, and there wasn't a table to be had, so we gave our name to the hostess to be texted when a table became available (Note: D's uses NoWait).  Fortunately, we arrived right at the end of the derby, so several tables soon cleared out, and we received the text within 10 min., despite an estimated wait of 15 min.

Once we were seated at one of the high tops next to the mural, we perused the menu to decide what to order.  Because I don't eat beef, I decided to go with the turkey dog ($5.50), style of the month for May (topped with pierogies, onions, and sour cream), as well as a veggie dog ($5.50), Angry Tiki style (topped with bacon, pineapple, hoisin sauce, and spicy cheese sauce).  CM decided to go with the bratwurst dog ($6.50), Mason Dixon style (topped with chili and coleslaw) on a wheat bun (+$.50) and a turkey dog, Big Ben style (topped with fries, cheese wiz, and cole slaw).  In addition to the dogs, we ordered a large order of fries, pub style ($8).

The fries were brought out first, per our request, so that we could munch on them.  I'm pretty sure they were the largest order of fries I've ever received--they would have solved the Irish potato famine in a jiffy!  They came drenched in cheese wiz and generously sprinkled with real bacon bits (not Bac-Os!), with a sizeable cup of ranch dressing on the side, which we promptly poured on, as well (yeah!).  Despite all the dressings, the fries were pleasantly crispy, due to being of the battered variety.  However, over the course of our meal, they became progressively more soggy, due to the dressings soaking into them.  Between the two of us, we finished about 2/3 of them--not too shabby, esp. for people of our size!

As for the dogs, to my surprise, I was more of a fan of the Angry Tiki than the pierogi dog of the month.  When it comes to the dogs themselves, I preferred the turkey dog to the veggie dog, which I found bland.  However, the toppings of the Angry Tiki dog were so flavorful that they masked the blandness of the veggie dog, which was only detectable when I bit into it alone.  Although I thought the turkey dog itself was more flavorful, I wasn't impressed as much by the toppings, which consisted of what were no doubt Mrs. T's pierogies and too many grilled onions for my taste (I removed many of them).  CM preferred the turkey dog to the bratwurst dog, and the Big Ben to the Mason Dixon style slightly, but enjoyed both styles.

The service at D's was friendly and efficient--our orders were placed and fulfilled promptly and with a smile.  During the short time that we waited for our food, CM and I enjoyed examining the mural, which contains many real life and fictitious characters, and the monk decorations on the other wall.  Although we didn't order any beer, we checked out the beer cave before leaving, and were quite impressed with the selection--now CM has a neighborhood go-to spot the next time he needs to bring a six pack to a party!  With the City Dining Card, our total came to $23, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food received. In sum, we were very pleased with our experience at D's, and would definitely return, esp. in light of the proximity to CM's residence and the extensive beer selection."}
{"text":"What a cool place.  The beercave was very unique.  If I hadn't just had my wisdom teeth out, I would have totally sampled some of the fine brews they had stocked away.  What I did enjoy was the friend zucchini.  It was hot from the fryer when it got to our table, and it absolutely hit the spot.  I'd never had it before, and zucchini is one of my favorite vegetables.  My friend said that the service can be slow, but we didn't have any problems."}
{"text":"Just made my yearly pilgrimage to D's after my eye exam across the street.  Great Taps (local offerings and belgian style) with Chicago style hotdogs, what more do you need to know!...Waiter made some excellent beer suggestions and I rarely stray from the \"off the rack\" Chicago dog but his suggestion to add the bacon was spot on.  No trip is complete without visiting the beer cave.  Some hard to get gems can be had.  Many of the choices can be found at Giant Eagle now for less.  Their selection of Mikkeller offerings was an unexpected bonus.  Walked out of their with some great hard to find titles...see you guys next year!...."}
{"text":"D's is a family friendly bar with a great selection of beers, pizza, sandwiches and dogs. I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I'm in love.  I came from a place where there were hot dog stands all over the place and found that, in general, Pittsburgh is lacking in that area.  Craving a hot dog, I found D's on Yelp and figured I would give it a try.  

I was intrigued by the specials menu so I started with an order of wings and Buffalo wing hummus.  This Buffalo girl was pleased.  The wings were tasty and done perfectly.  And the hummus was so good I wanted to ask for the recipe.  

The flavor combinations of the hot dogs were crazy.  Who would ever think of putting pineapples and bacon on a hot dog?  Well, I'm glad they did.  It was an interesting mix of flavors and was very satisfying.  If I hadn't also tried the wings and hummus, I would have tried at least two other hot dog creations.  Aside from the creations on the menu, you are also able to customize your own creation.

There is also a \"beer cave\" that I can't review since I didn't try any, but it looks impressive.

I eagerly await my next trip to D's!"}
{"text":"My dining partner assured me they had every beer I could think of.  I asked for a personal favorite, Pliny the Elder.  The waiter was gracious and consulted the inventory expert.  Nope.  He suggested another IPA which was on par, so I was content with that.

The food is acceptable.  Nachos were with the round yellow bag chips, plus some cheese sauce, and a spattering of jalapenos.  The Chicken Supreme Sandwich was kind of boring, but filling.  You don't go here for the sandwiches; I recounted this story to someone and they were unaware that sandwiches are even sold.  I am told their namesake dogz are excellent, but I can't verify.

We took a visit to the beer cave before we left and I saw a great assortment of top beers with many of my favorites.  I'm not a beer snob, but I know what I like.  La Fin du Monde, Trois Pistoles, Arrogant Bastard, Boont, Lagunitas IPA, all present and accounted for.

The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here after a run in nearby Frick Park, which I felt gave me license to have a (delicious) hot dog washed down with a few great beers. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the extent of the selection of beer here. Also -- I'm visiting from Seattle and they have Elysian on tap! 

Elysian Night Owl is the best pumpkin variety I have ever had in my life. 

Came here with my aunt Joanne and she really couldn't believe that as a beer enthusiast I had never been here. 

Try the Elysian!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise!

My friend and I came here after a failed attempt at the Braddock Food truck event at the Braddock Gentleman's Brewery (or whatever it's called).  

The menu has so many options!  There was a 30 minute wait when we showed up at 8:30.  That was discouraging at first but with all the options thirty minutes was no big deal.

I got the Hawaiian Hot Dog (it's not called that, it's just the one with the pineapple and bacon).  It was a pretty solid choice.  I also got the macaroni and cheese.  I was very happy that it was $3 but I guess you get what you pay for.  It did taste like it was a box of Kraft Mac and cheese.  So not really original or special but definitely classic.

I also ordered a hard cider. It was on draft and $8.50.   I thought that was pretty pricey for a draft beer, however it's probably one of the smoothest ciders that I've had, so it may have been worth it to some degree.

All and all, it was a nice choice on the fly."}
{"text":"Showed up on a crowded and sunny Sunday afternoon and found some stools in the corner. Even though the place was super busy we were quickly found and served. Dogs were delicious, Cole slaw was amazing, fries and beer were perfect. Go eat, drink beer, walk in the park."}
{"text":"This place is like my second home. Not just because of the beer. Not just because of the great food - like hot dogs, pizza, burgers, salads.  But, because I just love the atmosphere there. The staff is awesome. The people who eat/drink there are always there to just have a good time while enjoying having a few great beers.
I recommend this place for anyone that just wants a beer, anyone who loves hot dogs, etc.  Their pizza is actually REALLY good.

Oh, and they have gluten free beers, which is good since I don't eat/drink anything with gluten in it!"}
{"text":"NOT gourmet food, but incredible (better than gourmet) fries and hot dogs! Quick. Delicious.

 Ohhhh, forgot to mention the beer. We truly learned about beer at D's. Maybe $20.00 for food and $100.00 of remarkable beer to take home. Yeah, we had a couple to go with the dogs and fries... and the rest went home for tasting (that's a fancy word for drinking).

Seriously, I do not know of any place that has more beers on tap or in a bottle anywhere!

Although we have been visiting the Monroeville location lately since we live in Murrysville, D's Regent Square is where we learned about beer. (and fries!)

Like a kid in a candy store, you will love the Beer Cave."}
{"text":"This restaurant is like heaven on earth. You can't beat having a few cold beers while throwing back a plate of nachos and gourmet hot dogs. Located in Regent Square it has the perfect neighborhood vibe in combination with a fantastic sports bar. The menu consists of bar food that has been elevated to a new level. The fries are double fried so they have that extra crunch that everybody loves. The hot dogs come in all different styles, ranging from chili and cheese to an avocado and jalapeño topped dog. I had the Big Ben which came topped with cheese, fries and Cole slaw. The bun was big enough to contain all of the toppings, which is critical when you eat hot dogs like this. The casing had that bite I love in a hot dog, each bite sounding wth a snap. It had the taste that brought me back to my childhood. What differentiates this hot dog from the others were the toppings. The slaw and fries tasted so good and balanced out the hot dog flavor. 

My only critique is that the whole bite was one dimensional. The fries were a bit soggy after being covered in the slaw, I wish they were put on top to give that desired crunch. to each bite. Even the addition of bacon or tortilla strips would provide the crunch."}
{"text":"I would never have expected so many vegetarian options from a beer and hot dog place. The menu items are also very creative. There are no boring hot dogs here! Decently priced for the amount of food you get. 

I got the veggie fries, big ben veggie dog and the chihuahua veggie dog. The fries had avocado, cheese and ranch on top. They were really crispy and deepfried but the dressings softened them up. The big ben had fries, cheese and slaw. The slaw was a bit too creamy for me but it was a good idea. The chihuahua had avocado, cheese, salsa ans jalapeños. I put the salsa and jalapeños on the side so I could control the level of spice, and I'm glad I did! This was probably my favorite of the three things I ordered. 

I have to say my one complaint is just how incredibly messy everything ends up being. I got ranch all over my car keys and made a huge mess of my silverware and the table. Sooooo many sauces. But if you are a bit prepared, or utilize the roll of paper towels they provide at your table, you should be just fine. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"we love to go to this place when we are in visiting the in-laws. it's a great place to meet up with old friends, order greasy food, drink craft beer, and catch up in a relaxed setting. The place can get kind of loud at night so make sure your group of friends aren't hard of hearing. The craft beer selection is excellent. You can make your own six pack to go or drink any one of the unique beers in-house. They also have beers on tap for a cheap price. Food wise, their wings are decent and the pizza is greasy and cheesy. The place is pretty bare bones 'burgh style. Not trying to be something it's not, but still offering unique, quality beer from around the world. For that I give it my fandome and return business."}
{"text":"Although this area of town seems to be full of yuppie/student assholes who should probably have their asses kicked on principle, D's is actually quite good. Besides the unbelievable selection of beer (which is nice, but I'm the kind of guy who likes the more exotic beers but is perfectly happy with a Miller Lite or a Bud), the hot dogs are pretty awesome. I had the Chicago dog and the Red Alert dog, both were excellent. Service was good too, despite the fact the place was packed when I went. You can also carry your beers outside to smoke or just chat in warm weather even if the few outdoor bar tables aren't available. Non-pretentious atmosphere, despite the yuppies and hipsters infesting the area, which is a plus for me. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A crowded, yet cozy place to get a great dog. The beer cave is impressive, and the rotating drafts have something for everyone. I had the pulled pork dog which had just the right amount of hot dog, pulled pork, and sauerkraut. The fries were well fried and not oily or overly crispy. The bar area was well kept and clean, and I enjoyed the first dog so much I had to get another. If you can find a spot to sit, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Pittsburgh-great food, wonderful service, amazing beer list and fantastic happy hour! Love the Pittsburgh salad, the pizza and of course the dogs."}
{"text":"Amazing. One of the best ever for bad to the bone great bar food."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and everything, but man, sometimes all you want is a hot dog.  And you can get this at D's.  Every hot dog or hamburger on their menu can be ordered vegetarian, which is both awesome and rare.  I ordered the Chihuahua (with avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa, and jalapenos) and my table split an order of fries.  SO GOOD.  Almost too good.

And you have to take a stroll around the beer cave.  It's not quite as impressive as I was hoping, but definitely worth the splurge to make your own 6-pack.  Last time I was in, I was able to purchase a 6-pack of porters - Anchor, Road Dog, Saranac caramel, Duck-Rabbit, Old Leghumper, and something else I can't remember - for a friend.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was in town for a recent sporting event and read good things about Ds. A bit off the beaten path, but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown, so should be easy ride from there, too).

Ds did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.

Next time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).

P.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers, so I assume those are decent, too."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese dog I had was just ok, but the Mason Dixon with its slaw and chili was killer. The fries and barbeque wings were just as good. I also liked the atmosphere, the mural, and the employees who were really nice and honest and helpful. It's in a cool neighborhood too. Go!"}
{"text":"Great food, GREAT drink selection.  

I have never had their hot dogs, because I'm generally not a fan of hot dogs, but my husband says they are fantastic.  

They have great wings - normally I'm not a fan of the dry rub variety but their ranch dry rub is great.  Dip it in some blue cheese and it's just perfect.  

I'm a huge fan of hard cider, and their selection of 15+ varieties makes me a very happy customer :-)  I love how you can just go pick it out yourself!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, excellent beer selection. But what is stuck in my head is that amazing cheesy brat on a pretzel bun. Freaking delicious. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Every trip to Pittsburgh (about twice a year) I stop in for a great dog and a choice of many  beers.  I suggest everyone stop by and enjoy a wonderful dog and beer!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, draft and bottles. You can get beer to go. 

Hot dogs and more bar food type stuff. The fries are double-fried (Belgian style) and plentiful. High points of the sandwich menu: The giant fish, the Big Ben cheesesteak (toppings include fries & coleslaw), and the half-pound keilbasa with horseradish, brown mustard, and sauerkraut. 

Good pizzas too. The Swissvale Shroom is awesome mushroomy goodness, and I love the Popeye's on a whole wheat crust.

One big warning: Service is wonky, especially if you order both pizza and sandwiches. The pizza kitchen is on a different schedule from the sandwich/dogs kitchen, and they make _no_ attempt to coordinate. Pizzas take 30 minutes and dogs take 10-15, so if you order a sandwich and your buddy orders a pizza, you'll be finished eating before his food gets there. 

Down sides: 
- The burgers are not very good. They come out large and dry. 
- Service is quirky (as mentioned above). 
- Gets crowded, especially on weekends. They frequently have a seating list in the dining room side, but I think the bar side is still \"grab a table\" - that's confusing. 

Beer only, though they've opened the \"loft\" upstairs that seems to have a full bar - I haven't been there."}
{"text":"Now that we do not live in Pittsburgh; D's is a must go to when we are back in town.  Their main specialty is beer and that is what I always have so I can not speak to any liquor or wine options.  The beer selection is awesome.  They have over 1000 different kinds of beer.  You just have to make your selection and they will open it for you at your table.  You can also create your own mix and match 6 pack to carry out.  
Now on to the food.  If you get french fries - I am warning you, the portion is very large.  The ones with bacon and cheese are a great.  We tried both the wet and dry wings and were happy with both.  Now the reason we came here; the hot dogs.  And oh are they amazing.   They have hot dogs combinations on the menu, but you can also create any combination that you want.  I am a HUGE fan of the Chicago Dog - they do it right!!!  
On a side note - if you like Root Beer, they have a great root beer on draft.  They do offer a children's menu as well and it is completely fine for children in the middle of the day.  You see tons of families.  
The staff has always been very friendly and helpful.  They know their beer and food very well!
If you have never been here; I recommend it."}
{"text":"I come here for the veggies dogs. My husband comes here for the beer cave. The beer is a bit expensive (compared to buying it in stores in NY). But if you're craving your favorite difficult to find because of the crazy PA licquor laws, this is your place. 

This place is family and group friendly, so sometimes you might have a wait."}
{"text":"A day after the St. Patty's day libations the only thing I'm craving is some greasy junk food. Regent square hits the spot with some chili cheese fries straight from D's. Normally I enjoy fishing around the plentiful selection of booze. A hair of the dog was not gonna happen that hangover Sunday. I stuck to shoveling high calorie food into my gullet instead.

The last time I was here I selected from the hot dog menu, and they weren't that great. How can you mess up a frank you may be wondering?  I can only guess that it's the dogs themselves or the way they are prepared. They're kinda chewy. Dormont dogs rallies but the best Dog I've had was at Dirty Franks in Cbus OH. The chili cheese fries are good though. So today I made sure to get my fries fix in and try a burger. This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.

The burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat? If I am shopping for picnic eats I do go for Smith hot dogs WITH the casing or the large sized Hebrew Nationals. Now those are the mouthwatering crowd pleasers I'm talkin' about!"}
{"text":"D's is a classic pittsburgh joint.  Their main fare is hot dogs with a wide variety of toppings, but their menu also includes other standard bar foods like Pizza, calzones, hoagies, etc.  

But let's be honest, while the food is good, when D's comes up in conversation it is unlikely because you are raving about the \"chicago dog\" you had there last night: D's is widely recognize as the location of the \"beer cave\", a massive collection of beers from around the country and even around the world.  Everything from little-known microbrews to fairly exotic imports like Delirium Tremens (the variety comes from the fact that they are owned by the same people as the nearby McBrooms beer distributor, I have been told).    

A group of us grad students goes there every thursday night, so say hello if you're there.  An added bonus is that the \"new\" side of the restaurant is already smoke free."}
{"text":"I'm selective when it comes to my five stars, it has to be somewhere I frequent regularly that gives solid service every time. That being said, D's is no exception. I live right around the block and they're SOLID. 

The food is amazing, I personally don't eat the 'meat' hot dogs, but my friends and family do and they've said that the beef dogs are some of the best they've tasted. I order a veggie dog every time and it's never mushy or overcooked. The wings are slammin'. Also, do yourself a favor and wear your stretchy pants because you're probably going to order the largest order of fries and eat until you can't breathe. (On another note, the small order of fries will feed 2-3 people easily.)

You'd be hard pressed to find such a vast selection of beers, the make your own 6 pack is one of the greatest things and they always have a killer array to pick from as well as seasonal beers that you're not going to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Overpriced hot dogs.  Undercooked wings.  And the most disgusting cheesesteak hoagie....no lettuce..no tomato...no nothing...with hardly any cheese and a stale bun.  Music so loud my beer bottle was literally dancing across the bar from the vibration.  Had to scream for the person next to me to pass ketchup to me.  We asked for our money back, and the manager gave us attitude.  I will go back when the place sells toast on a stick, otherwise, I won't abuse my stomach...or my ears."}
{"text":"Though Dee's doesn't look like much from the outside, it is a hidden gem. They have one of the largest beer selections I have ever seen! The staff is helpful and friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"D's is a great dive bar in Regent Square.  I had a Chicago-style dog with bacon, and fries to go, for around $6.  The dog looked like a chef put some real love into it - it was picture perfect, lightly dusted with celery salt, relish tucked in like it was ready for a commercial.  The taste was perfect!  The fries were awesome - batter-dipped, super hot, crispy and just salty enough to not need extra.  I'll definitely be back.  Not a lot of joints know how to do a good Chicago dog.  Good cheap eats."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to D's in years so when my friend and I took a hike through Frick Park and decided to stop by D's to grab some grub I was anxious to see if my memory of my past experience was on point years later.

Well it was - great atmosphere, staff and food.  I had the Chicago Hot Dog with a handful of fries.  Perfect amount of food and I couldn't even finish the fries...and they were some goooood fries!  

I got my first pumpkin beer of the season from their beer cave and while I can't remember the brewery it was exactly what I wanted on a cool and crisp day after a hike.  

This is a great spot for some craft beers and bar type food."}
{"text":"not bad! good dogs, super beer selection, and lots of hype. I enjoyed it. I wouldn't scream in ecstasy over it, but i would visit again if I were in the area. Thumbs up for the veggie options and the reasonable pricing for good food."}
{"text":"D's was always an OK stop in the neighborhood - a good in-between from the bars that are a little too divey for the the GF to the sit-down restaurants that are either BYOB or too formal for us. Sometimes you just want fries and a beer! D's fries are great, some of the best I've had. And having the beer cave is a great add-on, no worrying about what's on draft. You can find whatever that suits you and try new things! Burgers are also a good value and leave you stuffed.

The rest of the food menu is pretty bland. Dogs are OK but on the overpriced, as are the sandwiches/hoagies. Staff is usually attentive, and if I can't find my server, I can always flag someone else down with no hassle. The drafts are over-priced and can be hit or miss. 

What really takes D's down is this:
http://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2017/11/06/D-s-Six-Pax-Dogz-blackface-halloween/stories/201711060112

In a neighborhood where residents found a noose in front of their house, a business who's owner who thinks it's OK to use shoe polish as part of a Halloween costume and then a 'sorry I offended anyone post' isn't one I want to patronize. I suggest you consider the same."}
{"text":"I have so many fond memories at D's with family, friends, and my partner. My dad, an avid beer enthusiast, first started going to D's back when it was half its current size. Since my dad passed away, D's has become an extra-special place where I can remember him by drinking his favorite beer (Unibroue Maudite).

I'm happy to see how successfully D's has grown its space, beer selection, and menu. All the dogs and wings are delicious. I never order pizzas or sandwiches, because I'd rather stick with the classics.

D's will always be a five-star establishment to me. Rating it any less would feel like a deep betrayal to my family! :-)"}
{"text":"I have to echo the sentiments of others on the service here...it is always friendly and quick (but not suspiciously so). Plenty of beers to choose from on tap, in the cooler and back room with some awesome wine selections to boot. The hot valentine, mac n cheese and chihuahua dogs are my favorites and I could bathe in the avocado spread that tops those immaculate veggie pub style fries."}
{"text":"I love this place! Vegetarian options are good and the atmosphere is great. I also love the beer selection. It's really a great place to go for lunch, but can get pretty dang busy on weekend nights!!"}
{"text":"Love this local hot spot, also crowded and lively.  Greasy comfort food, great beer and root beer.  amazing election of bottled beer.  Staff is nice and this place is super kid friendly.  Order the veggie Chicago dog. Yum and messy too so watch your feet."}
{"text":"Wow. 

What is this?

What are these buns? 

How do they make coleslaw and a hot dog not be a weird thing? 

Wow. 

So Josh decided that this was the place to be randomly on a Wednesday at 9:30. He made the right choice. 

He ordered the Angry Tiki, and the Big Ben. Their special on Wednesday nights is any dog and fries for $6. (In all honesty, josh can't get away anywhere without two meals.) I was lucky enough for him to let me try both. They were great. The tiki was weird, at first, but everything came together in the end. The Big Ben was perfectly strange. Whom ever came up with putting cole slaw on everything in Pittsburgh is a genius. He also had a side of sweet potato fries. They were okay, the one that I had was kind of underdone, but they were still good. 

I played it safe with the bacon cheese dog. It was great! Two slice of bacon; and a big blob of cheesy goodness. My fries were crispy, and their ranch tasted as close to eat n parks as you could get! I want more already. 

Go. Drink. Be merry. Eat the dogs and enjoy. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"As a former Regent Square resident and a current Point Breezer I can tell you that D's is a diamond in the rough.  Want an excellent hotdog?  How about a thousand beers to choose from?  Want to mix and match some beer and take it home to enjoy later?  Well, you've found the money ball.  

Your biggest challenge here is getting a good parking spot.  But don't give in, you'll get a spot and you'll be happy you did. Don't like hotdogs you say?  Well, they have delicious pizza too so whatever floats your boat you'll find it here."}
{"text":"I love D's! Every Tuesday, a group of us from Pitt come for the large one-topping $10 pizza night! The waiters and waitresses are always so friendly, I have never had a bad experience here. The beer cave  is a must! They have such a variety of beers, that there is something for everyone! Once you make your choice,  put it in one of their beer coolers to make it nice and cold. You are crazy if you don't like D's!"}
{"text":"I am really impressed with both food and service at D's. They have a great selection of beer on tap and in bottles,  as per their name. I ordered a custom dog with Philly Cheesesteak toppings. The ticket time on our food was a tiny bit long but it was a busy day and they checked on us several times to offer refills in our beers. The food came out hot and fresh which is a nod to the fact that they actually were busy and made it when they could...not as if it had been sitting under a hear lamp somewhere. 
If you're a hotdog enthusiast, you probably have the same benchmarks for a good dog as I do.  I'm pleased to say that the bun was soft and fresh and the dog had  a ton of flavor and that perfect snap as you bite in to it.  The toppings didn't take away from or mask the flavors of the all beef dog,  but added to the flavor party going on on that poppy seed bun. Their fries are also a must. Never have I had such a crispy fry. 
Dining at D's was a great experience and I recommend it to anyone wanting a casual meal with great menu choices."}
{"text":"D's Six Pax & Dogz is a legend in the east end. I have eaten here once or twice and gotten takeout from here once. It's tasty, and the beer selection is impressive, but the experience hadn't quite knocked my socks off until last night. 

My husband ordered some to-go food to eat while we were at the nearby The Loft bar. He ordered the Mac'N Cheese hot dog with Fries. The hot dog was incredible! The mac and cheese was so delicious that I asked one of The Loft's bartenders for a fork to finish off the 1/2 cup of mac and cheese that had fallen off the bun and was laying sadly in the styrofoam box. I wasn't wasting a bite of that deliciousness. The fries were really tasty, too -- super crispy and perfectly seasoned.

Based on my overall experience at D's, I still rate this place 3 stars. However, if I have a few more of the Mac'N Cheese hot dog and Fries combinations, I may be quickly updating my review!"}
{"text":"I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.

Their beer selection changes often, and I've never been disappointed.  If I don't know what the beer is, they'll often bring over a sample to try to make sure I like it.

The veggie dogs are great, the cheese fries are great, and I've never had a problem with the service.   It can get crowded when a game is on, but just grab a beer and wait for a table.

Pros: Fun menu, great draft beer selection, beer cave!
Cons: Sometimes crowded and loud"}
{"text":"Obviously the great rep of this place is their beer selection.  A lot of bottles.  Decent tap selection, though you are guaranteed to have a rather lopsided selection among the taps.

Food is fair; I've yet to go there with others and have our whole meal come out at once.  Salad will come first, then a couple of dogs, then fries.  If you are polite and civil and believe in not eating until everyone is served, well, let's just say that no one ever taught the manager, cooks or servers here that lesson.

Now, their service:  Really lackluster.  \"Entitled\" is the word I would use.  It pains me to give them 15%, because honestly, they don't earn it, even when I was a regular and knew some of them by name. Meh."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are so wrong! I see the billboards stating that they are the new cigarettes. But, hey, I smoke too, so I'm not that amazing of a listener! I do try and make sure I eat healthier than my disgusting smoking habit but we stopped into D's on our way back into town and I was still in vacation mode! I ordered a chili dog because I am not insane and their spicy cheese dog! Both were delicious! The spicy cheese dog had pepper cheese and pickled relish on it and I love anything pickled! The chili dog was also really hearty but I did wish there were jalapenos on it. i suppose I could have gotten them and am just lazy. Either way, great food! The only reason why I am not giving it a perfect rating is because the bill was pretty high for hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a long day on the road

It's a beer and bar place.

They have a variety of beer, they have a room all the way in the back with lots of different beer and a separate room displaying other kinds of beer.  They also have outdoor seating.  It's like 2 shops next to each other separated by a hall way.  I didn't even know there was a spot next door until I went to the restroom.

The fries are good.
They offer pizza and other goodies too.
They have many types of different types of dogs.  I had the veggie red alert which is spicy.  They have 3 kinds of hot dogs so it caters even to the vegetarian.  Regular dog, beef dog and veggie dog.  You have unlimited toppings - mushrooms, onions, creamy avocado etc.  The dog came in this little boat sized paper tray.  I find it very hard to eat because all of the toppings would fall off to the table, but they do have paper towels for you to put underneath if you want to do this so you can eat whatever falls off.  The veggie dog tasted like the real thing.  They also have dogs of the day.  
Quite an interesting place but worth the visit in a little town."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you probably enjoy watching people eat hot dogs and will want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. 

What? I can't be the only one. Seriously? Fine. Then excuuuUUUuuuse me. I'll rephrase for the supposed masses.

If you enjoy eating hot dogs, you'll want to make D's a destination when hanging in the 'burgh. It's a great place to go and get some tubed meat in a variety of different mix and match combinations and also a great place to meet new people... perhaps you'll even meet someone who shares your love of you eating hot dogs and you can shower them with many moments of which they can watch you eat your beloved wieners and y'all can live happily ever after. 

No? Ugh, fine. Then just eat the damn hot dog all by your lonesome. See if I care.

I came in with a group of friends for a semi-liquid lunch and though it was the beer cave that brought us in, I was secretly more excited about watching my friends eat hot dogs. You see, I'd been feeling super sick for the entire duration on my Pittsburgh road trip. I think it was a bad Cholera strain. Anyway, my party of six allowed me to sleep in extra late while they wandered around some graveyard by our hotel with scones until I was all puked out and ready see what the light of day looks like. I was feeling bummed that I had to hibernate through my original morning plan of going to the zoo, but the thought getting to see my pals suck down chili dogs all Jack & Diane style really helped lift my spirits.

We walked in, sat down and I was immediately excited to be sitting across from their epic celebrity mural. It's like a pop-culture/history 'Where's Waldo', only there's no Waldo, and instead Gandalf, Wolverine, John Candy, and more. I spent the entire time between ordering and the food coming out staring at the wall and finding new peeps. My only gripe on the artwork is that the mural was seriously lacking in Bill Murray biz-nasty, so for that I have to subtract a star. Okay, no. I'm only (half) joking about the star thing. I'm actually deducting the star because their veggie dog was pretty damn terrible. I mean, the toppings (I got the chihuahua with cheese and jalapenos) were fine, but I think I've microwaved dogs that tasted better than theirs. It was so freaking rubbery and tough and chewy... like bad calamari or trying to chew a whole pack of rock hard Bazooka Joe at once. My jaw was tired from trying to force my tearing teeth into that little soy sausage but the worst part is that I had to devote so much extra time to eating my stupid wiener that I missed being able to watch my friends eat their hot dogs. Boo-urns. Next time, I'll skip the veggie dog and go with a wrap or pizza or burger or something that'll allow for more wiener-peeping.

On the other hand, the veggie pub fries were damn good and something I resented having to offer to share them with my friends... but I did offer because I felt like it would detract from them getting 'weirded out' at my wanting to gawk at them like I bought a ticket to watch them eat hot dogs... even though that wishful thought didn't pan out anyway thanks to the lackluster veg-dog I ended up with. 

Their beer selection was stellar and their beer cave in back was a fun shopping experience and great place to find a few rarities. They actually had the Rogue Voodoo Doughnut bombers that you can hardly ever find. Unfortunately, my sickness impaired me from imbibing and I actually spent the latter half of the time there barfing in the bathroom (not to the fault of D's) while my friends shopped for a bevy of beer in the cave. Also worth mentioning is how friendly everyone here was. Lots of helpful staff members and even the other ladies in the bathroom who were concerned with my hurling to the point where they wouldn't leave me alone and I had to lie and say that it was no big deal, I was in my first trimester and the morning sickness was getting the best of me. Very nice people those Pittsburgh folk are."}
{"text":"When owners name a restaurant like this take the hint!  They didn't name this place Six Pax & Hummus!  Come here for beer and dogs.  There are other things on the menu but the stars of the show are in the name.

So let's talk dogs first.  Each one is going to cost you $4-$5 and they are large, delicious and messy.  You definitely want to be among friends when you eat one of these bad boys and have plenty of napkins.  If you are only eating dogs, many folks order two.  Every topping imaginable is available.  Another popular choice is one dog and excellent fries.  Add a craft beer or two and you have one heck of a fine casual meal.

Speaking of craft beers, the selection here is excellent.  I appreciate that the names are up on an easy to read board that includes the ABV%.  If you are new to craft beers, many of them are very strong.  Let's say you normally drink three or four Coors Lights and now you are discovering the pleasure of Delirium Noel.  It's a 10% beer and if you drink three or four you are in for a big surprise!  In the interest of safe driving for everyone, be aware of the ABV%.

So the food is great and the beer is excellent and I've found the service to also be right on.  These folks are extremely popular so at peak times it's mobbed.  Do yourself a favor and show up off peak and you'll eat and drink much more quickly."}
{"text":"Sometimes the service here is hit or miss...they can get pretty busy. It can also get pretty crowded. But the food is good and the atmosphere is fun and laid back. And can you beat a room filled with beer? Can you beat mix and match six packs? Nope. 35 cent wing night, yum. Crazy deep fried, bacon covered hot dogs, yum.

I will say though that I could not go here while I was pregnant...you can smell the delicious beer in the air and the Beer Cave taunted me mercilessly with that which I could not indulge...sigh. That was a tough nine months.

Things I don't like so much...tables too close together and too small. The macaroni and cheese is bland, although you can't ask much for two bucks. There is nothing on their website right now other than the menu. Servers can be a bit brusque or forgetful and not refill your drinks without asking, but it kind of goes with the atmosphere I suppose.

All in all as a Regent Square resident this is our go-to place to hang out and bring friends and visitors."}
{"text":"Hot dogs were delicious and fun to mix and match toppings. They do fried dogs too and it's great. Beer selection is obviously fantastic. Check our their beer cave!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the reasons we decided to move to Regent Square. I am not really a huge hot dog fan, but the BEER CAVE and FRIES keep me coming back (not to mention that it is walking distance from our house). We lived in San Francisco for several years, and this place also reminds us a bit of some of our old haunts in the Mission. :)

In the summer, they open up the garage style windows, so this is a perfect spot to sit, sip beer (skip the wine though-- its not great) and work on your laptop or newspaper. If you are not into sports and just wanna chill, D's has two sides, so you don't have to feel outnumbered by screaming Steelers fans.  D's always has a nice mix of people as well- from young couples with kids, students, hipsters, to elderly folks. The staff is really nice and friendly and the large mural of local Pittsburgh celebs is pretty neat as well!

Yeah, this place is one of the best, laid back spots here.  I am in love with the FRIES! I know I said this once, but they seriously do something very special to them that I cannot figure out."}
{"text":"D's quite possibly has the best beer selection in Pittsburgh. There are always 20 micro brews on tap and they rotate seasonally. Last time I went they had a variety of pumpkin beers and I pretty much tried them all to figure out which I liked best. If you aren't feeling any of the beers on tap then take a stroll to the walk in cooler in the back and take your pick of hundreds of bottles. Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass. 

The bartenders are really chill, and though the service isn't overly attentive, it is perfect for the vibe of D's. And speaking of the vibe, D's has this old pub style feel with the walls meeting at strange angles making cool little nooks and crannies where you can sit and sip your beer with friends or maybe just read a book.

D's is also known for their hot dogs, and while good and inventive, in my opinion are a little overpriced. For some reason I have trouble spending $5 for a hot dog. I've tried their wings and fries too, both good standard bar food, but again a tad overpriced. My friend and I drank beers (a good amount) and ordered food and our tab was $100.

D's still remains the gem of Regent Square and is worth the pilgrimage to Beer Mecca if you have never been."}
{"text":"A great place for hot dogs and brat, and great on tap selections of microbrews."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  Love the atmosphere.  Went here on Sunday 4/23 evening.  No wait.  Great service   Chili cheese fries and Big Ben Dog.  Everything was great.  Crispy fries were nice to have with the chili.  The Dog was crispy and very hot when served and a nice snap.   


Keep it up."}
{"text":"I am SO glad that we live within walking distance to D's! The beer cave is to die for (though I find it hard to believe there are 1,000 beers in there) and stocks some pretty hard to find brews. I love that you can make your own six pack-- a great way to try a variety of beers without having to take the risk of hardcore commitment. There is a smaller refrigerated section at the front of the cave too, which is nice. What I really appreciate is that D's serves veggie dogs (a pretty uncommon find) that are pretty tasty! I quickly became smitten with their veggie Chihuaha dogs. I've also tried their nachos which were good (wiz, not shredded cheese). Great for takeout and dining in alike."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are supreme as are the fries. Went with my SO, we each got a dog and split the \"veg\" fries (ranch, avocado, cheese). Grabbed a make your own six pack as well. Will def be back - gotta try the burger!"}
{"text":"As the name suggests, they serve primarily hot dogs and beer. But wait - it's not just any hot dog! They have quirky names on different dogs with even more eclectic toppings. I also got their fries and don't regret a thing. They have the best fries in Regent Square, hands down. 

I'm tempted not to say which dog to get because I feel that the decision would weigh too heavily on whether or not I have a palette for dogs. Nonetheless, you can't go wrong (I got the Big Ben). 

Also a great bonus - you can grab your own beer from the beer cave in the back and chill out."}

Terriffic neighborhood place for a small group to grab some terribly unhealthy food and try some new beers."}
{"text":"Go to the Beer Cave! For me to give a five star review, I have to walk out of the place saying, \"That place is really cool.\" I had a bottled microbrew, a chili coleslaw hot dog, and a side of fries for under $10. It was really good."}
{"text":"Everybody told me about this place when I said I was moving to Pittsburgh and, sure enough, it is awesome.  All the Belgian beer a girl could want.  And the wings.  And oh, the Mason Dixon dog."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here a few years ago on one of our many trips to Pittsburgh and had to come back.

The first time I was there I had a Chicago Dog which was delicious. I can't remember what my wife had but it was so good she insisted we make it back on out most recent trip.

We stopped by around dinner time on Saturday and the place was hopping. We sat on the bar side which was even louder than the restaurant but fine for us to have dinner. The staff was all very nice and gave our option of eating outside, at a table by the bar or waiting for one in the actual restaurant.

Since my last trip I became a vegetarian and stick to a pretty strict low sodium diet so I didn't try the vegan hot dog (though I may next time I visit). I was happy to see the other vegetarian options which were on the healthier side. I ended up getting the grilled veggie salad which was so large I had it for dinner another night.

My wife (who is NOT a vegetarian) had Bacon Cheddar dag and a handful or fries pub style and said both were delicious.

We both had the draft root beer which is absolutely delicious.

Maybe it's because I'm not from the area but I don't think the prices are THAT high, for what you are getting the seem reasonable to me but I can see how to compared to some other places it may feel like you are paying a lot for what you are getting. To me it's worth every dime.

I actually love hot dogs which was the reason we came here in the first place but we love the food so much there that I am more than happy to get a salad or another one of the healthier options."}
{"text":"D's is just a great place to hang out. We biked here that single nice day in April and had lunch. The atmosphere is very chill, and the servers just wait on whoever needs help, which is cool. I am not a beer drinker but the beer cave is so impressive! I'm sure I could have found something special but wasn't in a browsing mood. Another thing, when I heard \"dogs\" I thought great - not veg friendly! But mistaken! They had tons of veg options! Not only veggie dogs are offered, but they have a great hummus platter, salads and more! I LOVED the hummus... so tasty! All in all, a great experience! I would love to come back and watch a daytime game here and grab a tasty bite!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I discovered this when I was looking for a place to buy beer to go by the bottle that had a good variety, then I discovered this place was a full bar/restaurant.  Besides getting bottles to go, you can also drink from any of their many drafts on tap or their individual bottles.  Many are already in a chilled section, but they also have a beer chiller machine that can chill a room temp bottle in like 5 minutes! And they have a huge selection of beers, both imported and local microbrews.  They also have a nice menu with a variety of things, including hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, etc.  Hot dogs are one of their specialties and I'm not a huge hot dog fan but the bratwurst I had with bacon and mac-n-cheese on top was amazing! I also had the fried zucchini appetizer which was cooked perfectly and the sauces were very tasty (marinara and a spicy ranch-like sauce).  I went on a Wednesday evening post-happy hour and was surprised how super crowded it was, so it may be hard to get a table on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Great place for kids, believe it or not. They have a lot of kid friendly food options and is loud enough nobody even notices if they're a little loud. Will definitely be back with our family."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good hotdog?  Add some ketchup, mustard, relish, onion, peppers, chili, coleslaw...? Mac n cheese...?  Whoa - wait these aren't your ordinary hotdogs!  Well, that's how D's does dogs...

Just your local neighborhood beer cave with an incredible all-beef hotdog... nbd.  But they are a big deal in flavor.  A mural of Pittsburgh heroes graces the wall and a hefty beer list awaits.  Can't find one you like on tap?  Check the cave, but make sure your waiter pops the top for you. Still can't find one you like?  Well then we can no longer be friends...

The menu has everything from hummus to homemade pizza and it's all delicious.  Today I ordered a chili and cheese dog and another topped with Mac n Cheese.  Both incredibly delicious and filling.  They have their specialty dogs like the Mason Dixon  (dog with chili and coleslaw) or the Chihuahua  (salsa, jalapeños, and other deliciousness), or you can top it your own special way.  You can't go wrong with these puppies... or doggies... you get the idea.

Next trip I'll be adding Mac n cheese to my chili dog.  Why not combine the two toppings, right?  My mouth will be so very happy."}
{"text":"D's is a great place to drink to your heart's content with any darn beer you please! They have just about any beer your little mug could possibly conjure up. The service is quick, not overly friendly but they get the job done- what you expect from a pub type atmosphere.  A great after-work unwind."}
{"text":"What is there to say about D's that has not been said?

It's a fixture.  The food is remarkably good for pub food and the beer cave is a fun \"thing\". The waitstaff are usually very good and parking in regent square isn't hard to find.  

I also have found the bathrooms pretty damn clean for a bar whenever I need to pee.


I hope D's is with us for decades to come."}
{"text":"Very very VERY good beer selection. I liked going into the \"beer cave\" and finding a wide selection of Belgian beers including ones that I hadn't seen since studying abroad in Paris. Hot dogs were excellent, and not as messy as I had anticipated; the fries were fantastic. Service was a bit slower than I would've expected for a lazy Monday afternoon. I don't think it takes very long to prepare a hot dog, so that's the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars."}
{"text":"best. beer. selection. hands. down. We waited almost an hour for a table but the bartender was super attentive the whole time and was on point with suggestions. It was def worth the wait too! We ordered a pizza and a few apps which were so good. No complaints here - we will totally be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to scout out Regent Square as I'm fairly new to the area and it was recomended by someone who lives there and really talked it up.  So, I parked and started walking, looking for a lunch spot.  

I spied D's Sixpax & Dogz I think because of it's open air concept.  the tables weren't outside but inside next to the window and I noticed there was no glass on said window.  Yay!  Let's head inside to nosh and get a nice breeze.

It has a nice atmosphere -- a nice bar pub and enough people dining to get the feeling it's a happening place.  

I have the feeling dogs are the popular item based on the name of the place but I'm really not a hotdog fan except at sporting events so I opted for the Black 'n Blue Burger smothered with bleu cheese and cajun seasoning.  It comes with homestyle chips and I added an order of coleslaw. Wonderful burger -- big, moist and tasty!  Definitely hit the spot (multiple spots, actually).  Very satisfying lunch.

Side bonus for me -- happened to hear music from a local band from Denver (former homestead) while dining.  Made me homesick."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a beer drinker so I'll focus on the food. My girlfriend is vegetarian so I'm always looking for a vegetarian-friendly menu. It's rare that she has almost as many choices as I do, but D's delivers on that front! The veggie dogs are actually very tasty and it's great that there are a variety of vegetarian offerings. The mac n cheese dog is unique and fun, but probably not something I'd get regularly. The vegetarian pub fries were something I hadn't had elsewhere and they were very good. Not light on the calories, but definitely tasty. I've tried a few other dogs and you can't go wrong. If you're a beer drinker, that's just icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"The name itself is pretty self explanatory.  You can pretty much get a hot dawg any way you like it.  Although I've never tried a Chicago Dog in Chicago, D's Chicago Dogs are one of my faves on their menu.  D's also makes a mean chili which is good on your dawgs or pomme frites.  Not to mention the plethora of beer!! They have almost every beer imaginable (unfortunately not on tap). D's is a local favourite and is definitely worth a try when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"D's looks unassuming, but it's really over the top. Sure, they have fries, but why not order fries with bacon and cheese on them, plus ranch dressing on the side (You should, by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). You could order a plain hot dog, but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank, and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado, salsa, cheese and jalapeno? Plus, your dog (even if it's a turkey dog like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me is the peak of hot dog flavor.

I feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door, but with their sense of humor, the label would say \"Warning: the food inside is damn delicious and best consumed with a great beer.\""}
{"text":"First stop on my Midwest Brew Crawl with the BF! 
The BF ate here once last year and loved it so much that we decided that we needed to make it our first stop on our road trip to Minnesota. We planned our departure time so that we could get here at lunch (it was a mere 7 hour drive!) 
We both ordered the Bacon Cheese all beef dog (hot dog with bacon and melted cheddar on top) plus a corn dog, dusted wings and two root beers. We didn't try any of the beers on tap since we still had a lot of driving ahead of us. The Bacon Cheese was ridiculously good and I wished that I could have finished it. Unfortunately I hogged pretty much all of the corn dog since it was AMAZING!!!  The wings were also really good, maybe even among the top three chicken wings that we had the whole trip.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the Pittsburgh area or anyone who is crazy enough to drive 7 hours for a hot dog."}
{"text":"Vegetarian hot dogs!!!  This place has awesome toppings- they have great combinations on the menu or you can make your own.  Pair it with a beer from the long draft list and you'll be happy.  Great for everyone."}
{"text":"very good pittsburgh food! get the big ben dog or the big ben burger and add a side of chili cheese fries to share with the table. Do not go while on any type of healthy eating plan. 
There's a big menu and everything is unhealthy and delicious. Not overly greasy or salty though. 
I have never personally checked out there beer selection but it is certainly plentiful. Service is usually quick and friendly. 
Very nice when the weather is good and the garage door in front is open. Otherwise it is a bit dark and dingy."}
{"text":"Awesome! Hands down the best Mac and cheese hot dog!! Chicago dog was very good also. D's wings were spicy but very. Definitely a must go back to place."}
{"text":"The best hot dog I've had. Ever. I also have to say trying to decide which hot dog I wanted was by far one of the hardest decisions I have had to make (food-wise). Eventually, I got the chihuahua dog because it was out of the box and I wanted try something new. It comes with avocado spread, salsa, cheddar cheese, and jalapenos. The dog itself was perfectly crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside and really just the best I have had. The toppings were great and I was happy I gave it a try. My friend got the bacon and cheese dog. I was expecting bacon bit type bacon, but they were full strips of bacon that were perfectly crisp and the melted cheese was right on. I am certainly going to come back and try a new hot dog. I am very exciting to finally have a hot dog place that I know produces fantastic tasting hot dogs. 

I would definitely recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a beer or two before the Pens game. Bartenders were very friendly, especially considering how busy they were. Food is perfect drinking food."}
{"text":"D'z is hands down my favorite go to spot for good eats. I love their wings and their hot dogs. 
Everytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer, they have this ice cold dunk tank to put your bottle in that gets it nice and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:

I love their wings and hot dogs and my masterful veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice and crispy and hot and smothered in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've tried almost all their dogs expect 2 and my favorite is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys a classic Chicago dog. The have delicious sauerkraut that i enjoy as well so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. Now when it comes to the veggie burger i love the way it taste. I do it up real nice by getting that black n blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best burger i've ordered in a loooong time. 

If your looking for a fun hangout spot for you and your buddies or even a tasty treat for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. 

Due to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me at D'z. We truly regret not waiting to go here but time was of the essence. D'z you truly are my favorite spot to be any day at any time and you will always be the place i wish i would have been proposed to at!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was really awesome, and I wish there were more places like it.

Boyfriend and I and a group of friends were in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and I found D's on yelp.  The hot dogs looked delicious, and my friends are real beer fans, so we thought it'd be perfect.  It was better than expected.  

First, obviously, the beer selection is amazing. You can either order off their menu, choose a beer from their walk-in fridge, or venture back into the Beer Cave (where they've got every beer ever) and throw a bottle or too in the chiller.  Five minutes later, the beer's cold and delicious. We all took advantage of this, and picked up six packs on the way out.  

Second, the hot dogs were really good. I definitely recommend the Angry Tiki dog.  Sweet, spicy and really delicious. 

The only thing is they don't handle groups well. There's plenty of room, but once we'd already split up our check amongst everyone's credit card, we were told they don't usually do that for more than 6 people.  The guy did it for us anyway, but it took awhile, and I'm still not really sure who got charged for what.

If you're in the area, or even almost in the area, make a trip to D's. It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Over 200 reviews and over 100 photos. What more can I say other than I've been coming here for over 15 years and have never had a bad experience. True beer lovers love D's.  Oh, and the dogs ain't bad either."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place.  I love the dogs, of course.  I love the beers, of course.  I love the Beer Cave the most.  I'm not sure if it's the largest collection of bottles, but it's pretty impressive nonetheless.  I just wish that the beers I wanted had the prices labeled.  I swear, every one I grabbed for had price tags on the beers surrounding it but not on the one I wanted.

Anyway, the dogs are tender and juicy.  Even the veggie dogs are pretty convincingly \"dog-like.\"  The fries are plentiful and pretty damn good.  Greasy and salty (but not too much of either) and a perfect accompaniment to beers and hot dogs.  The servers are friendly and helpful with the menu.

Pros: great beer selection, wonderful food, friendly staff
Cons: I was here after brunch to catch the hockey game and they had NCAA basketball on instead; not a big deal, but enough to be annoying"}
{"text":"When I lived in Pittsburgh, I lived in Regent Square, and D's was one of my favorite spots. At the time I had a 3 year old daughter (who loved hot dogs), so we would walk in the wagon up to D's and have lunch or dinner. Great beer selection, and the hot dogs (and everything else, really) were great. My daughter also loved the hot dogs, and especially the bucket of Dum Dum lollipops that could keep her occupied while we waited."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a beer on a Saturday night. Great selection of beers and the food looked good. Very busy on a Saturday night, but the staff seemed to handle the customers with ease."}
{"text":"Love this place and the selection of beers. Can't say the good is all that spectacular but love the vibes and atmosphere if you want a cute bar to hang with friends! Awesome late night beer run too when other places aren't open!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food is excellent! They could definitely come down on prices or at least INCLUDE fries or a side with everything at a slightly higher price point. 3 dogs costing me over $16........  Not cool!  The folk are nice though and the food is actually quite good. Not like 'typical bar food'! Still a great place. Do yourself the favor and stop by."}
{"text":"Enter into D's (after figuring out the correct door - I still make this mistake) and you'll be greeted by a long draft bar. For Chrissakes, they have Delirium on tap! The real jewel, though, is in the back. You have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold beers for carry out, or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill them on the spot. D's is still the only place I've ever found the elusive Hopfenweisen by SchneiderWeiss and Brooklyn Brewery, perhaps the best beer I've ever had.

While D's is worth it for the beer alone, the food's not bad either. The pizza is average, but they truly do have the best hot dogs in the city.

Finally, bring a growler or buy one of theirs. Prices are reasonable and the selection is outstanding."}
{"text":"Spotted D's from a brunch spot across the street. Okay... to be honest, I  spotted a sign for Bloody Mary's and Mimosas and that's all it takes to excite me on a sunny Saturday morning. After breakfast, we ventured over and bellied up to the bar. My brother had a few beermosas with an IPA. He compared it to Blue Moon with an orange... but better. I had a few basic Mimosas (although they offered a few different varieties) and tasted a few beers. I also, tried one of their hot dogz with jalapenos and cheese. It was really great! They had a nice selection of craft beers and even offered some options for brunch (besides dogz). So you could totally eat there for breakfast. The 6 pack shop is connected and has tables you can sit at. I was really impressed, the employees were nice and accommodating. Really neat place. I'm excited to come back."}
{"text":"We love D's!! The bartenders and wait staff are always cool and attentive. The hot dogs and all the food is always good and consistent. They always have a good array of beers on tap and hello, Leona's ice cream sandwiches!! We love going here at least once a month."}
{"text":"There are tables but we opted to order our dogs in the bar. The bar was small neighborhood size, busy, very laid back and everyone was enjoying themselves. People in Pittsburgh are always friendly. We stopped here on our way to a Penguins game. They have a great jukebox, lots of great beer & hot dog selections. The only challenge was parking, but D's is located on a great street. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Yum! I think Ive been here three times since moving to PGH, 

Fav dogs: Chihuahua , Brat, and Chicago style dog. Never tried other entrees but their fries are nice and crispy. 

They have plenty of Belgian beers to choose from a bonus in my beer book.

Beers: usually a good variety on tap plus tons of variety if you need to one stop shop and pick some six packs up in the back. 

Warning though if it is a busy summer evening you can wait up to one hour for your dog I think this is because they have tiny kitchen behind the bar. So if you're super hungry go early or later or fill up on their beer first. 

Also this doesn't really bother me i still ate my food but the guy cooking the food didn't wear gloves and did touch the food with his bare hands often. If you're OCD maybe just get a beer or don't sit at the bar where you can see this. Don't worry he didn't pick anything up off the floor and put it back on plates, i checked. :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place after drinking down the street for a few hours with the girlfriend and a new friend.  To say this place was a godsend at the time would be an understatement.  We walked in the door right at 10.  We were greeted and asked if we were eating or drinking.  Having been already pretty beved up, we were just after some food.  The guy (wish I could remember his name) behind the counter told us the kitchen closes at 10 but he'll still hook us up.  My girlfriend got two vegan dogs and said they were delicious and my pub fries were amazing.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"D's is a great place!  Its unique as far as quasi-bars are concerned insofar as I go with a friend and have some dogs/burgers/pizza/wings and a few beers, and have a great time; yet feel equally as comfortable taking the family for a night out.  The food is good, the staff is friendly, the prices are great, and the beer selection is fantastic.  Its a great place for a family meal on a budget!"}
{"text":"Beer and Dogs.  This isn't your ballgame 7 dollar Miller Lite and generic hotdog either.  This is 7 dollar Chimay and a loaded Chicago style dog heaven.  A lengthy review of a place that relies entirely on beer and hot dogs would be redundant, so I'll keep this short.
Great atmosphere, Decent enough staff, Fair prices, BEST beer list anywhere I've ever been!  If they don't have something you want on draft chances are you can find it in their beer cave.  And the hot dogs and fries are always atop the City's Best.
If that isn't enough to get you stop by D's then you're missing the point and probably shouldn't anyhow."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The pizza is great, along with their other food, and there is a good draft list. The service is fast and has free wifi!"}
{"text":"New menu! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I got the rundown of PA drinking laws, its resulting greatness in D's. This probably has the biggest selection of anywhere I've been and the food is great too. Every loaded fries that passed hooked my eyes like I'd been celibate for a year. Take a dollar off for take-out beer too. I love the descriptions in the menus and how every hot dog is the same price."}
{"text":"D's famous, expansive Beer Cave brought us here by necessity being that Kay and I were throwing a housewarming party the next day and required some alcohol for our guests. We didn't walk out with any booze thanks to an honest employee who directed us to a cheaper beer distributor down the street, but dine on some fabulous franks we did. 

Hey, we had enough cooking to do in the morning, and since D's serves food...

Resisting the urge to destroy burgers wherever I see them listed, I opted to take on a duo of dogs as did Kay: A Chicago and a Bacon Cheddar. Kay stayed true to her Southern roots and went for a Mason Dixon (a slaw 'n chili dawg) and a Mac 'n Cheese (yup its on there), neither of which I got to try.

The Chicago is just that; relish, onions, pickles, tomatoes, sport peppers, yellow mustard, and celery salt on my choice of a Vienna All-Beef frank, all of it contained in a mattress of a poppyseed bun. 

If THIS was an \"authentic\" Chi-town style hot dog, then Chicagoans are more blessed than they know. 

What I couldn't fathom was not only how the folks in the kitchen got all of the components inside a bun but also how they did it in such a picturesque manner. It was so aesthetic, I was afraid to munch on it.

From there, I got down 'n dirty with the Bacon and Cheddar and found that the molten orange goo almost usurped the beefy, salty flavors of the grade-A proteins, taking the bread with it down to the bottom of a sea of cheese Primus would avoid. 

Coming back to Chicago from Yuba City (I kid my uncle's hometown), I found that this regional take came off more like a sandwich, transcending its genre so to speak. Fresh tomato cuts stood where ketchup should not. Sport peppers livened up the affair like GG Allin. A literally neon-green freakshow of a relish acted as a feather boa as well as a sugared counterweight to the briny proceedings. Dill pickles added more sass and bite as well as chill, and the yellow mustard/onion tandem had a bit to say about tradition. Archetypal, the majestic franks within each sheath of bread, but particularly the Chicago, were mountains above ballpark or arena fare. The flavors of slain, ground, smoked, grilled bovine were ALL you tasted upon breakage of the natural casings, and no amount of topping could smother or deny them. Note that I said the cheddar on the former dog was ALMOST overwhelmed. Not even Cheeze Whiz can kill wieners (stop...snarking...stop it!) like these. 

A \"handful,\" as D's calls it, of french fries were beer-battered and superlative in every crisped, aurulent way frites can, should, and must be. The BBQ wings had a sauce that was stickysweet like a certain Def Leppard hit and fell apart in our hands and in our mouths. Come, come ye wing fanatics. 

Another valid reason for D's to be is its energetic, far from obnoxious, live-and-let-live atmosphere that few places can match let alone top. People we absolutely did not know came up to us, asking us how we liked the food, if we had been to D's before, how our night was going, and etcetera, glorious etcetera. We dined underneath a whimsical painted mural full of famous people and fictional characters. While awaiting our meal, we spotted Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, Spider-Man, Bill Cardille, Richard Pryor, Bruno Sammartino, Captain America, and we'll leave it at that so as not to spoil your time-killing, conversation-making fun. 

Regent Square is fortunate to have D's. Come on a Friday night, grab a seat, have a frank, sip a cold beverage, and allow your weekday worries to disappear."}
{"text":"Love, love, love me some D's. I've been going pretty consistently for the past 6 months or so and every time I go, it's just as good. I always get different hot dogs, which are always amazing and the wings are awesome too. Fries with cheese on the side are a must, so amazing. You can also customize your hot dogs and put whatever you want on them. Their beer selection is endless and they are always switching up their draft list seasonally as well. Also staff is super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"D's, Oh D's.  What a fun place to hang out, walk thru the beer cave and drool...also select a few beers to go.

While it is not gourmet, U can have a gourmet dog.  The root beer is great, too.  So bring the kids.  

Friendly but gruff service! lol!  

Try the fries with chili or cheese! or the pimped up Pub fries!  Yum!   They have other food but I tend to get a dog, my fav is the Chicago Dog."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get these intense cravings to stuff hot dogs and greasy french fries in my face. As someone who doesn't eat meat, the hot dog part of that is a rare occurrence. Thankful D's gives the option for veggie dogs. This makes me very happy. It also makes my hangovers happy too.

Not to mention they have an absolutely spectacular selection of bottles and drafts. If I'm not here enjoying the little pleasures in life - such as fat, grease, and gluttony- I'm enjoying another sinful pleasure, booze. Every time I come here I'm overwhelmed with choices. 

This place is magical."}
{"text":"D's has the best wings ever! Boyfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight. It was loud and crowded as I'm sure it is a lot of the time. There was a bit of a wait (about 15 minutes) before we were seated at a table. We got the garlic butter wings, pub fries, and chose kielbasa for our hot dogs. We LOVED the garlic butter wings. I don't think I've ever had such great wings before. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and had so much flavor. We also really enjoyed the pub fries. The hot dogs, however, were just mediocre. It took them a long time to get our food to us, but they apologized and gave us two free hot dogs cards for next time. Although I can't honestly say that the hot dogs are that amazing here (even with the kielbasa), I'm sure we'll be back for the delicious wings and the fries.

{"text":"Well, it has good hot dogs and a wide, wide variety of beer, stocking without pretense; Miller and Unibrau.  The hot dogs are good.  The beer is unfortunately not so cheap; six packs aren't much cheaper than just buying four or five beers.  Bad for groups more that four people; great for two or three."}
{"text":"Living 2 blocks from this place is dangerous.  If you're into quality beer and good pub grub, then this is your place.  My favorites are the pizza, chicago style hot dogs and cheese fries!  When it comes to the beer, let's just say that there are more selections than you can imagine (... they claim 1000+!!!)"}
{"text":"One of the few reasons I may miss Pittsburgh when I go to grad school. The hot dogs are piled on high with the best, fattiest stuff I can muster up, and the beer selection is one of the best in Allegheny Co. Great for a night out with friends, followed by indie movies at the Regent Square Theatre across the street."}
{"text":"D's is the coolest. Their beer cave is truly a sight to behold. In this state of ridiculous liquor laws, it's a feat to have so many beer options in singles and make-yer-own six-paks. They have chilled choices (or a super-chiller if you want to cool something quickly)  and non-chilled options. There are over 1000 varieties, and the awesome \"Beer Manager\" has the whole inventory all in his head! And he gives helpful recommendations.

The food is good too. The wings are great, and the fries and chips are delish. I'm not a hot dog person so I can't comment on them, but the husband loves them. They're Chicago-style with Chicago-branded meat and buns. Authentic!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down my favorite place to grab a beer in the east end. They have a great draft selection that changes often in addition to a beer cave of cold bottles. Staff is efficient and friendly and they play great music. I also love their wings...D'sWing Dust (dry rub) is my favorite flavor."}
{"text":"How have I lived in the 'Burgh for so long and have never been to D's?! The travesty! We went for beer and hot dogs but, judging by the looks of everyone else, the rest of the menu and drink options are just as good...

Let's start with the poppyseed bun...just doesn't get better than that. My hubby and I each ordered multiple dogs - so I was able to sample his as well.

The Chicago is *gasp* just as good as if you were in Chicago. The Chihuahua is like if a hot dog and a taco got married - yum! The Mac'N'Cheese dog weighs 20 pounds but is worth it just for the delicious mac. The Cuban is everything you love about Cubans but in hot dog form. The Angry Tiki was my favorite: pineapple, bacon, hoison, and Double Dip sauce - um, yes please! 

I'm not a huge fan of the deep-fried/double-fried french fries but they were at least fresh and piping hot. Also, there are plenty of options for kids to eat. Plus, to keep everyone occupied while you wait, there's coloring sheets and TVs everywhere.

The beer menu at D's is just as satisfying, with every type and pour size you could imagine. I'm pretty picky with my beers but had no problem finding more than a few that I wanted; and, my hubby is an IPA aficionado and was over the moon to find a Triple on the board.

One downside to D's are that it is pretty small on the bar side - and a there's a long wait on the restaurant side. It is also extremely loud and can get warm when it's packed. 

The only other con, which is more of a symptom of our voluntary gluttony, is you will leave feeling uncomfortably full :)

Overall, I LOVED the food at D's - and the bill wasn't that bad either. I highly recommend it for a yummy lunch or dinner and drinks with friends or the whole family!"}
{"text":"Great fries.  Lots of bar food -- burgers, six packs, dogs...etc.  

The restaurant is small and got VERY crowded.  A few tables and wooden chairs and a couple of high top tables by a garage door that I imagine opened when it is not frigid cold out like tonight.  It is like a beer bar without a bar.

Several beers on tap...I imagine that is the reason for the crowd because it certainly isn't the food.  The food is greasy Pittsburgh fare that doesn't seem really all that great.  Granted, I loved the fries.  But would I wait for 30 minutes for a table for really unhealthy, generally unimpressive food?  Nope.  

Fortunately we had just beaten the crowds or I would not be writing this review.   After we were seated, people poured in.  Families with little kids and groups of older adults standing in the crowded doorway waiting for the opportunity to eat mediocre food.  Hmmm....makes me think a new restaurant in Regent Square is in order because there is clearly a deficit."}
{"text":"i really like this place and if i were in squirrel hill more often, i'd definitely visit more. there is only one reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, but i'll get to that in a minute.
the first i had heard of d's was their six pack shop. they have a large selection of room-temp, cold, domestic, craft, import, normal-size, giant bottles that you can make your own 6 pack with. this was the first place i had ever been to with those kind of options, but now i realize (here's why one star is taken off) the prices for 6 packs are not nearly as wonderful as the selection. now, obviously, with mixed bottles, the price will go up, especially if you have expensive kinds in there. but it seems they charge full price per bottle, which is a pretty lousy deal in the end.
but prices for eat/drink-in are totally acceptable! in fact, i don't believe i had ever eaten at d's until a recent yelp event. their hot dogz are FANTASTIC and i only had a beef dog with sauerkraut, not exactly anything fancy. i also got to sample their hummus and dry-rub bbq wings, both of which were also super tasty.
the service is always really friendly here too. there's plenty of room to sit down (bar, table, \"loft\" upstairs with a bar and a few tables). and there's even darts upstairs, too.
d's is definitely worth checking out and if you've never seen the 6-pack \"cave\", at least take a browse, buy one if you're feeling spendy or simply don't have a place like this anywhere near you."}
{"text":"I totally understand a good spot with someone on waitstaff/a cook/ etc having an off day resulting in poor/slow/etc service, but a whole TEAM of people having an off day?

We got to D's around 4:30PM. Ordered waters and all our food at once since we were hungry: a burger with onion rings, a pepperoni pizza,  and some cheese bread. My husband took our toddler outside for a walk, since he was losing his nerve, and right as they stepped out my burger came to the table. Great! Nothing worse than an ornery, hungry, toddler. We all rush back to the table and get ready to eat. A few minutes later the cheese bread comes out, okay, cool. I start in on my burger thinking the pizza for my husband and son is coming ANY minute. 

But it doesn't come. And it doesn't come. And it doesn't come. By the time we started to feel a little perturbed about it, I was on the last bite of my burger and my son had eaten through half the onion rings on my plate. My husband was using our appetizer as his meal and closing in on the last piece of two of cheese bread. He decided to get up and see what the ETA was, since no one was really coming round to give us updates, refill water, etc and was told it was coming out in \"five or ten more minutes.\" This is after we had already been waiting about 20+ mins. 

Whomever was primarily working FOH followed behind my husband back to the table, apologizing for the wait, and when my husband pointed out that I was already done with my entire meal while he and our hungry kid sat at the table still waiting, the employee then copped an attitude and started in how he can't control the pizza cook times. No duh. You certainly CAN, though: refill our water and check in with us about the status of a major part of our meal so we know what's going on. He then went on to excuse the slow service by saying burgers cook faster than pizza. That, too, is okay but if you know a burger cooks faster why not time it so the burger comes out at the same time as the pizza? I'd much rather wait just as long as the rest of my family for my meal so we can eat together. Timing is important. 

The food is consistent. It's good. The service today was AWFUL: staff hanging around chatting while we struggled to get someone's attention for more water, super delayed food, and defensive explanations as to why it was taking so long (he even checked when he put the order in and seemed surprised he had done it 20+ mins ago). I think there will be a bit of a break until our next visit."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love this place! I live in Regent Square and I'm here weekly. I secretly bought my house because it's walking distance to D's. The beer selection is awesome. The food is great. The staff is amazing - they always make my family feel at home. The kid LOVES the mac n cheese. Being vegetarian, the selection is decent. I only wish there were a few more salad options for veggie lovers."}
{"text":"The dogs are good.  The fries are decent.  The salads are good.  The wings are good. The pizza is good.  Even the burgers are decent.  Their draft selection is awesome.  The Monday night 35-cent wings are now the Monday night 50-cent wings.  They could have at least gone to 40-cents first..."}
{"text":"Love the BEER CAVE - would make any beer-neanderthal happy! Sorta like grabbing a cold one out of your friend's fridge, except D's has a giant selection.

The servers were pretty friendly, even when it was last call. I can't say the food was so great, but the beer options and good prices help to make up for it. This seems like an easy-going neighborhood bar, and I bet it's even nicer when the garage door window is open during the warmer months."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Plenty of beer selections, including several gluten free options. I like to watch games here, and this is a good spot for larger parties (5+). The french fries are excellent and very crispy, even better with cheese and bacon."}
{"text":"In my final meal in Pittsburgh, I finally had the closest thing to a Pittsburgh sandwich and that was the Big Ben Hot Dog with cole slaw, fries, and a cheese sauce. It oddly worked and I enjoyed the meal before I had to hit the road. The fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle. Definitely a great cheap eats spot."}
{"text":"best beer selection ever! it was hard to pick just one beer out of the beer cave. The food was really good. Big fan of the fries!"}
{"text":"D's isn't a neighborhood staple. If you've never been and you love beer, you simply must stop.

I love the chihuahua dog and typically whatever their dog of the month is. I also love the Mac and cheese and the swissvale gold wings.

It's honestly hard to go wrong here with such a great selection of beer and food!"}
{"text":"Good place, a lot o beer selection. Simple food. I watched the World Cup here and was very nice with the front open to the street for outdoor seating. Good fries."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is kind of how I felt about this place, which I realize is an opinion that seems to go against the grain. I had heard about D's time and time again. Everyone talked about it like it was the greatest place in existence. I had such high expectations! 

I suppose maybe I was expecting too much, which led to some disappointment. A few friends and I went here on a Friday night and it was (predictably) packed. We were fairly lucky to get a table almost right away. 

I obviously had to acknowledge that the beer selection is impressive. If you can't find it here, you probably can't find it anywhere in Pittsburgh. I had to check out the famous \"Beer Cave\" which seemed to have just about everything. I think I'll make it a point to pick up some brews here next time I'm looking for something unusual or new.

I wish I had more to say, but I just wasn't feeling it. My friends love it so I'm sure I'll be back, and next time I'll make it a point to try the food. Judging by some of the other reviews, that might change my perception of the place."}
{"text":"This is paradise for beer connoisseurs. A range of beer that confuses, bedazzles and quenches you thirst for quality brews. The selection on lager and ales on tap as well as in the 'beer cave' make this place one of a kind. The special hummus, fries, hot dogz, and pizza make it the perfect hangout place any given day in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I love two things: beer, and hot dogs. 

I really love hot dogs.

Gross, I know right? My bf is a vegetarian and he won't come near me with hot dog breath. 

But this place has veggie hot dogs too!!! 

Not to mention- the amazing amazing beer selection. Definitely one of the best I've seen in the Pittsburgh area. Coolers line the back wall and part of the perimeter of the store. If you get take out, it's a dollar off a bottle! Yayyy. 

They also have a cooler that (I think) is constantly reserved for whatever seasonal beers are appropriate at the time. Mmmmmm.

Try the Roethlisberger hot dog, it's got cole slaw and french fries on it."}
{"text":"It was either Mother Theresa or the Baha Men who said \"Who let the dogs out?\" and I must say, I was glad someone let my bacon cheddar dog out of the kitchen and into my stomach.  Dee-licious!

Stopped in here before seeing a movie at the Regent Square Theater for some beers, dogs and chili cheese fries.  I had two IPAs that were good and reasonably priced.  I couldn't finish the fries so I took them with me to the movie theater and the lady didn't mind that I brought them in.  I finished them fairly quickly once the movie started (I was seeing the Swedish version of \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" so this was a while ago.)

Also, since I was just visiting town, I didn't have a car and I rode the bus there all the way by myself!

So the point is, you can eat here and get a great dog and good beer, and you can also take the bus here and then see a movie."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in PGH. Great beer selection - check out the cave. Awesome food. The fries are the best. $1 off take out bottles."}
{"text":"When I still lived in Regent Square it was a regular spot. I still go back now and again. It's nice because there's a mix of people there at any given time. Families with small children, couples on dates, groups of friends. All different ages. French fries and hot dogs are staples. Chicago dog is what I usually get. Nice beer selection. It can get really busy and the staff is always on their game."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab a dog. Fantastic beer selection (check out the beer cave if they don't have what you want on tap!) they'll let you sample the beers on tap if you're unsure. Favorite things here are the hot Valentine dog and the angry tiki! You can add anything you want on their extensive list of toppings. I will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I had a taste for a good hotdogs and haven't been here in about 3 years, but nothings changed! Came and got exactly what I had a taste for and I am beyond satisfied!"}
{"text":"The buns, the buns! They are so good!!!!

That's the first thought when I bit into my hot dog. It's so good! But then my second thought was, this dog is also good... and the toppings! I got the Chihuahua dog which was covered in cheddar cheese, jalapeno's and avocado cream sauce. I wish I hadn't already eaten brunch, which lead into lunch or I would have gotten more. 

They also have a massive selection of beer on tap, as well as the crown jewel, a beer cave! What's a beer cave you ask? Well, it's a large room full of tons of bottle craft brews from all over. They even have a smaller refrigerated section if you need a cold brew asap! 

I was stoked to see Sly Fox Christmas Ale not only on tap, but in the beer cave... although I did snag the last sad can of it in the cave. That's okay, just an excuse to come back. Not to mention more buns (and hot dogs to go with!)."}
{"text":"I think their beer selection is much more impressive than their hot dog selection. although, mac and cheese on a hot dog is a pretty amazing option. but really, come for the beer cave and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. First off, I love Regent Square. It's the cutest place, and this is the perfect place for a night out or even to get beer for a night in. My boyfriend is obsessed with the create your own six pack from the beer cave. We ate here on a friday and the place was packed but we got sat right away and our food came out fast. Amazing specialty hummus of the day ( i think it was chipotle ranch) and great sandwiches. The portions are huge and you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Pretty danggum awesome hotdogs, beer, and anything you could possibly want to order in a bar that would immediately spike your cholesterol 50 points.  Serious nachos?  Check.  Fries drenched in meats and cheese?  Check check.  It's some Blue-Collar goodness, with a little Hipster aftertaste.    

The hotdogs are worth the hype (yay Angry Tiki dog with pinapple and bacon!), and the beer cave is a happy place with one of the best selections in the city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and are here at least twice a week since it's such a close walk. They update their draft list constantly, always have food specials and the service is always on point. I love that you can either order a draft or pick a beer from the beer cave. Some of the drafts They have I've never seen at any other bar. We've had almost everything on the menu from the pizza, burgers, dogs, and it's all great! There is sometimes a wait, but they are usually pretty quick with seating people. It's definitely one of best parts of Regent Square!"}
{"text":"D's is perfect for those not so fancy afternoons. I love sitting outside with my dog and people watching while sipping on one of their unique beers. the staff is always so helpful with suggestions on what to drink. the pizzas are decent, the salads are my favorite, and the best burger on the menu is the Texas burger."}
{"text":"Great place for grabbing quick eats with an excellent beer selection. Their \"Beer Cave\" is awesome if you enjoy creating custom six packs. There also is a nice bottle chiller, so you can enjoy a cold one while the others chill. Higher than average prices. Nice neighborhood (Regent Square)."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a great neighborhood bar, and D's is mine. Of course, those near and far are drawn to its extensive draft list, infamous beer cave, intriguing mural, and the mighty beer chiller. Just an aside...D's has been doin' da damn thang a long ass time...aeons before lots of craft beer under one roof + good food was chic in this town. Respect. Yes, it's standard bar fare, but they do it quite well really...the daily specials are money and Wednesday's O.G. dog 'n fries for a scant $6 is my go-to. Choose from a signature recipe dog or BYOD with toppings galore to choose from. Beware of their beer battered fries -- doesn't matter if you order them or not, you'll still smell like a deep fryer when you leave so you might as well get 'em and I bet you can't eat just one! Dogs not your thing? No prob! There's always pizza, sammies, and wings (oh my!) to fill your tummy. Service has always been friendly 'n fast and it's kid friendly. So be a good neighbor, come to D's...where everybody is your buddy."}
{"text":"I love D's. I live nearby so I might be biased as it's my local neighborhood place, but honestly it's great. Lots of vegan and veg friendly options clearly marked on the menu which rocks and their beer selection is always on point. In addition to the beer cave their drafts are always perfectly appropriate seasonal selections that I'm excited to try. They rotate them constantly so if you're a frequent flyer you won't be stuck drinking the same beers all of the time. They are known for their hotdogs but don't over look other items on the menu, their Pizzas are fabulous and their Pretzel bites are seriously yummy perfectly crispy, salty and pillowy."}
{"text":"Generally, I like D's I. The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  

Some of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  

First of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? 

Also, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  

D's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original \"beer bar\" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? 

So all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!

Overall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.  After all, three stars means \"A-OK.\"  But to me, D's Regent Square doesn't go beyond that."}
{"text":"So many people love this place. And I think I like it as much as I do mainly because I enjoy how much they love it. But regardless if you're looking for a laid back atmosphere and some good hot dogs and beer, then this is your spot. D's is family friendly and I always see people of all ages sitting and eating. Half of the place has low top tables and table service, and the other side is seat yourself with a bar with some high top tables that also have table service. The waitstaff is super laid back and the menu is pretty straight forward American style things. A typical night for our group consists of some hot dogs, chicken tenders, and a few baskets of fries with guacamole and cheese. 

The main draw for me is their huge beer cave. You can feel free to walk back and wander around and pick any beer that you're feeling. They have a refrigerated section and a non refrigerated section. They also have a small chilling stand that you can pop your warm beer in to get it cold enough for you. They also always have a lot of good unique beers on tap."}
{"text":"D's is named perfectly.  They have great hot dogs, loaded with all kinds of fun toppings.  They have a beer cave, filled with beers from all over the world.  They also have delicious pizza and fries.  So if you are in the mood for bar food, this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"Their hot dogs and fries are affordable and good but even though they have like 300 different beers in bottle their beers are over price and will triple your tab. That and yet have a limited draft menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a great casual meal! Their Beer Cave and excellent make your own 6-pack/draft beer selection are well known. As someone who was not able to drink I was equally impressed by their delicious rootbeer also on draft. We had the Vegetarian Pub Fries to start, which was a large helping of french fries smothered in cheese and avocado with a side of ranch. I had the Chihuahua hot dog with a veggie hot dog and added grilled onions and my partner had a specialty Octoberfest hot dog. Both were large and delicious. We did not have to wait long for a Friday night and the service was excellent. The space tends to be crowded so this is not the place to go for a quiet fancy dinner, but the food and drinks were excellent and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Great little find just outside of the city....especially if you are Chicago dog fan"}
{"text":"To me Pittsburg food is anything with coleslaw and fries.  Case in point, different types of hot dogs with coleslaw and fries.  Fries here are amazing and I really enjoyed my hot dog.  They have a good selection of beer and an amazing beer cave where you can pick your own 6 pack from different brands and flavors.  A must."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is solid, the hot dogs are great, and the beer cave...mmmm.  My only complaint is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town!"}
