{"text":"Good food good prices. It's small and old but the food is eat you would expect at a place like this. My family and I enjoyed everything from the burgers to the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Good Food and timely, by-pass the Mac,BK,etc. this is the real deal. I usually order fish or shrimp, but burgers are very good also."}
{"text":"We don't live in the area but try to stop by when we are anywhere near.  Never changes,  always consistently great food,  reasonably priced. The staff is absolutely wonderful,  they seem to enjoy their jobs and it shows.  Wish more places were like this.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE this what a burger in concord!  It's the only one I'll eat at! Derrick  is the only one who knows I like my fries crispy! Everyone is so nice to me there! The new owner is nice! The what a burger in concord is awesome! I'll never eat at another except this one!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is dated and I liked that about it. The hamburgers are just like they were twenty years ago... great!!! It is definitely an experience. If you want \"new\" and sparkling and corporate cookie cut fast food, go to McDonalds. It's faster than Whataburger. The prices are very reasonable. You want a great burger, fries, and onion rings, you will not beat the place."}
{"text":"Lost my business some years ago with a rather dubious towing. Don't ever take your customers for granted to make a quick buck. You'll lose much more in the long run with lost business and bad word of mouth."}
{"text":"It was a pretty good burger.  Not anything near as amazing as I remember as a kid though.  I guess they are made to order as it didn't come out quite as quick as you'd think compared to most fast food joints.  If you ever find yourself at Concord court house its worth a visit.  Side note:  The religious quotes on the place mats seemed kind of strange, but hey, I'm not the manager.  Another side note:  Cash only, but there is an ATM!"}
{"text":"Cash only!!! Usually very busy. We have had FFs, burgers and foot longs. Love the chili and slaw! Ice is pretty good (I'm a part time ice critic). Good value for the items."}
{"text":"The best! Hometown atmosphere. Friendly staff, most of them are family and have been there 20+ years. They wrote the book on Cherry Lemon Sun Drop and when you want a What-a Cheeseburger all the way- it's the only place to indulge!"}
{"text":"No credit or debit cards accepted?! It's 2016!  Sorry, but didn't even get to the counter to order after seeing the sign."}
{"text":"Food is really bland. Portions are small for the price. Customer service was great though. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that when I asked for ice in my own Tervis cup and I was told I would have to buy a $.91 styrofoam cup instead so I passed"}
{"text":"What-A-Burger is great at what it does...fast food burgers, fries, and even breakfast. Everything is MADE-TO-ORDER so expect a short wait. Trust me, it's worth it!  The dining room is plain and a bit retro, with plastic yellow seats and tables, and metal Pepsi-Cola napkin dispensers. The area is very clean and well-maintained.   The menu offers typical diner food. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, French fries, onion rings, tater sticks, grilled cheese, and apple turnovers. Each item is purchased individually; there aren't meals or combos.   Remember, What-A-Burger is CASH ONLY. There is an ATM located inside for patrons to get money, but if you want to avoid the fees bring your own cash. The prices are very affordable for the quality of the items.  If you are looking for a quick, cheap lunch by the Cabarrus County Courthouse, What-A-Burger is just the place!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it isn't pretty.  But it is a classic dive type of place, and we enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"It is cash only.   We rerouted here since the restaurant I really wanted to eat at seems to have gone out of business. My husband has been wanting to check this place out. Seems very popular with locals.  We decided to eat in since this is not remotely close to home for us. Sat at a booth with husband and felt all eyes on us. I can blend in but my husband never could. It does not help when he wears outrageous uncoordinated gym outfits.   Despite the weirdness we felt, we enjoyed our burgers. The locals chatted amongst themselves and it seems like a cool diner type place to hang out at.   Burgers and fries were decent. Nothing spectacular but neither terrible. Affordable. Only issue is our large drink was filled to the rim with ice and there were about 4 sips of soda in the cup.   Overall impressions: Busy place. Nice employees. Decent burgers and fries. Good price-points."}
{"text":"American Southern fast food. Come clog up your arteries and have a good time doing it. Bring cash. Your newfangled plastic money ain't no gud here partner."}
{"text":"I use to eat here alot as a little girl when I use to come down for the summer every year. But I barely remember that so I had to eat here because I am tired of BK and McDonald's I want real burgers. This place is located in Downtown Concord on Church Street. The staff is very friendly. The what-a-burger with cheese is what I had which is just good and the onion rings are the kind I like the big fresh cut ones not the small ones which I hate. I tried this drink they had called the Witch Doctor which is mixture of all of their sodas combined with pickles/pickle juice and lemons. The girl at the front loves this drink but trust me this drink takes an acquired taste it is not for everyone. So I am going to pass on that drink the next I come in and just stick to the burgers and onion rings. The only downfall in this place is the fact they take cash only. But don't worry they have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"What-a-Burger is a childhood favorite for those of us born and raised in Concord, NC. If you go don't be shocked by the decor and be sure to have cash on hand. They do not take checks or debit/credit cards.  I usually get a What-a-Burger with cheese (you can also get a Double What-a-Burger if you ask) with a large onion ring and a classic Witch Doctor (a simple mix of all the drinks on tap and filled with pickle slices on top and bottom).  Good food on the cheap. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Saturday place is pretty steady that's what caught my eye. Place accepts no plastic CASH ONLY but there 8s an ATM right by the counter. Food is homemade no flavor. Place is real outdated soda is flat too. Stink like hot grease and is like a time capsule of old furniture. Grumpy staff you can hear and see. Now I'm sitting in my car with a belly full of beef I guess that's what is and curls and clothes on thus damp day stink like fried grease kitchen. Prices good."}
{"text":"My son got a what a burger and really enjoyed it. We just moved to concord and needed something quick and reasonable."}
{"text":"What-A-Bad-Burger.  I seriously have had better burgers from just about anywhere.  McDonald's included.  The fries are awful.  Just awful.  Think dried out Ore-Ida crinkle cut fries that you have to douse in ketchup and salt to make them palatable.  My cheeseburger was so dry that it practically crumbled while I ate it.  I only finished half of my cheeseburger and a few fries because it was that bad.  I had originally brought ramen noodles to work that day for lunch because I didn't have time to prepare lunch in the morning.  I actually regretted not eating my ramen noodles after I ate What-A-Burger.  That is saying something folks...  The best part of my meal was my unsweet tea.  The pellet ice saved them from 1 star review.  Do not waste your time or money here.  7 bucks for a lackluster burger and fries is nuts."}
{"text":"Upon entering the first thing you'll notice, aside from the overwhelming smell of the fryer is that this place is cash only; so plan accordingly. I ordered the What-a-cheeseburger, small onion ring and small Pepsi. My wife ordered a fish sandwich and small Pepsi. I noticed that the cashier was focused on getting the order correct. No small talk, no pleasantries, but about business. He wasn't rude so I can respect that.   After a few minutes our food arrived. My burger tasted decent. I know you're probably looking for a more descriptive word, but decent is the only thing that comes to mind. It wasn't horrible, but of course I've had much better. The onion rings were pretty tasty. My wife enjoyed her fish sandwich.   Overall, this place was ok. I think most love it for nostalgic purposes and I can did it. If I'm ever in the area I might drop back in but I don't think I'll make a special trip here."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back, they are rude as heck here. Parked there to eat while my boyfriend was in court and they were not welcoming at ALL. Telling people to leave if they're going to court after they eat. We are considered customers after we purchase something. Too bad, ate there a lot."}
{"text":"Not many people know of this drive-in \"chain.\"  There are a few locations left, including this one at downtown Concord, also one in downtown Mooresville (and I think 2 or 3 more around the area).  2 things you need to know: 1. this is not the same What-A-Burger chain out west (thus no point in clicking on the link posted above) and 2. cash only!  They have an ATM machine inside, but then I'm against unnecessary surcharges, and nothing is more painful than looking for your own bank's ATM machine when all you can think of is wolfing down a burger.  FYI, downtown Concord is Wachovia & BB&T friendly, with branches in walking distance, but you (and I) are out of luck with BoA... go figure.  For the longest time I didn't know I was ordering a What-A-Burger, I thought \"wth is a Water-Burger\" but I ate it regardless. Pardon my lack of understanding on local accent.  Then I realized Water-Burger is indeed What-A-Burger, that led me to ask why is it called What-A-Burger.  Then I realized What-A-Burger is a larger version of their burger, hence What A Burger! (think exclaimation), which explained why I felt so darn stuffed everytime I ate there.  Nowadays I mostly order a regular cheeseburger, with chili & slaw & onion (I'm a southern gal when it comes to my burgers).  A quick PSA, their burger patties are thin, so don't expect some sloppy looking thick burger.    They also have other offerings, like hot dog, corn dog, chicken wings, fried seafood, chuckwagon, bbq etc... For drinks they have your typical options, and witch doctor and Sundrop (you know you are in the South).  For sides there are fries (a-ok), onion rings (not bad) and tater sticks (oh yeah!).  Don't worry if you are slightly confused, here's the secret, you can't go wrong with Cherry Lemon Sundrop and Tater Sticks... they go with any entree option you have decided on.  The best part, it doesn't break the bank to eat here.  Oh yes, you can thank me later... and you're welcome :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Easy menu to pick from and overall good, solid eats. This place was recommended to us from a coworker and I think this place is more of a nostalgia thing than it is the best eats.  I just wasn't so impressed that I would rush back. The staff is great and friendly. So absolutely no complaints there but the burger was a bit on the bland side for me. I ended up picking at mine and only eating parts of it. The fries are the business but potato fried in grease can't go wrong. Onion rings are good, they seem to be a frozen variety - but I could be wrong.  Cherry Lemon Soda is the business so that is a must but ours were slightly over carbonated."}
