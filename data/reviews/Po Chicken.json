{"text":"Great chicken wings and juk (Korean style porridge). This is a nice family owned restaurant and the items we tried were delicious. I had abalone and my husband the shrimp & vegetable porridge and we shared the soy garlic wings. We ended up with the premium wings because the server made an error on the order but we really liked the soy garlic wings. The owner even offered us two free sodas because of the mix up. They really care about their customers which is appreciated. Juk (porridge or congee) is the ultimate Asian comfort and restorative food. The juk really hit the spot for me because it was tasty and it was soothing to my taste buds."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear about this place opening! It's hard to find a good Korean fried chicken, and this place nails it!  My friend and I ordered the Type C (half and half) and an order of regular wings. Depending on what you're looking for, the three flavors have you covered. The original is crispy, the soy-garlic is subtle but flavorful, and the sweet/spicy is the perfect combination. The wait is worth it, with all of the chicken served piping hot!  I'm sure I'll be going back now that I've finally found somewhere with a good"}
{"text":"The owners were friendly and food was excellent! I ordered the vegetable and beef porridge. Will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"There was an accident today that they forget my order. However, they had a very nice attitude and apologized to me. So I think their service quality is good. But still, I'm not fully satisfied with their food. I ordered fried pork (donkatsu) and Ganjang chicken wings. The fried part is crunchy, however they may used too much flour. Thus the quality of the meat couldn't be presented well."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this place. The Korean restaurant I used to go to in Michigan had spicy meat based stews. This is more seafood oriented, some spicy, some less so- all we had was wonderful. I wish I could come back to try everything."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible. I went twice. The first time was just OK. Plate is dirty, and I let them change one. My friend ordered abalone special porridge, and they came with a wrong one. I order a sweet red bean porridge, but it tastes salty.  The second time made me angry. My friend and I waited 30mins after we ordered food. We let waiter urge our food, he said he cannot, we should wait or cancel our order. We were hungry, so we choose to wait. Then 5mins later, the waiter came and told us he didn't put our order into system!!! He wasted our 30 mins. We were so hungry but got nothing here. And it seems the waiter didn't feel sorry about his fault. If u want to experience the horrible service, this restaurant must be a good choice."}
{"text":"Oh how my fiancé and I I have missed KFC (Korean fried chicken)!! We decided to go with Combo C half/half- 1 whole chicken roughly 14 jumbo pieces. Breading was perfect, Sweet and Spicy garlic sauce was the right amount of heat/sweetness. And the soy garlic sauce was not too salty! Everything was made fresh and the staff were accommodating and there to answer any of our questions. Will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"We had half and half crispy and Ganjang chicken. They were delicious! Been looking for some KFC(Korean Fried Chicken) and this place is pretty darn good.  Service was a bit slow but it was definitely worth the wait. We also ordered the sweet and spicy wings. They were okay. A little more sweet than spicy but good. It's a small hole in the wall place so don't expect it to be fancy."}
{"text":"This place has the best tteobokki and fried chicken among Korean restaurants here. The food is definitely authentic. I was missing Korean food and the food here hit the spot right on. I recommend 100%."}
{"text":"Best yang nyam chicken in the valley - hands down.   We got the type C which is a split between yang nyam and kan jang flavored fried chicken for 18.99. It took a while to get the order out but it was so worth it once we got it! The portion is fairly big. I was sharing with my friend and still had a quarter left afterward. We also ordered the hangover soup which is consists of bean sprouts and eggs. Simple but good. The only downside is the ban chan side dishes are a bit limited for the soup.  WiFi is available for use and the store is pretty spacious despite being a bit rundown. Plenty of parking spaces out front."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I came in on a Thursday evening and ordered the sweet and spicy wings and the soondubu.   The wings were definitely more sweet than spicy, but still good. However, I think I still prefer the wings at Bon Chon or even Gen. The wings tasted very citrusy. If you prefer your wings sweet, you'll love these.  The soondubu was under $10, so that was pretty nice considering how expensive Korean food can get. It also came with a lot of clams, which pleased my boyfriend a lot. The egg was already in the stew as well, which is different from all the other Korean tofu places we have been to where they give you the egg to crack yourself. The soondubu plate also came with an assortment of ban chan. The coleslaw is REALLY good!  Service was great and everything was super clean, including the bathrooms.  We are definitely going to return! It's honestly really nice to find a Korean place that isn't ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch and I liked it a lot! I know everyone is raving about chicken wings but...... I didn't want wings! (Although they looked delicious) I ordered after a lot of debate with my server the fried rice hot pot with spicy pork! This was super good especially when you add in the sides of kimchi (spelling!@?) and the little carrot spicy mix. I would definitely try this place again!  Something funny here with the menu because there are quite a few funny things and just as many misspellings that made me laugh.   Overall this is a hit for a Saturday lunch in my book."}
{"text":"Very friendly and great chicken.  Loved the pickled radishes and salad dressing.  Go with the wings for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker when it comes to chicken wings but if you love chicken wings then you NEED to try korean chicken wings!!! We got the hangover soup for only 8 bucks and it comes with the soup itself, side dishes, and a small bowl of rice! It's definitely enough to share between two person.  Came here a few times and the consistently definitely lacks just a tiny bit. One day the soup was so good and savory and the other it's a little bland. A little salt will do. But their soy garlic chicken wings are a must have! The regular fried wings is nothing special, but if you like plain then there shouldn't be a problem.   Service was alright. They take your order, brings it out and you pretty much don't see them again unless you ask for something. Restaurant used to be a Pho place so the decoration lacks a little. But as long as the food is good then I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is bangin' . I ordered the type C combo with a steamed egg and it was delicious. The steamed egg had a nice flavorful broth and was seasoned well. It's pretty rare for AZ to have a dedicated place to have Korean Fried Chicken. This place reminds me of Kyochon, or Bonchon. Type C includes: half soy garlic sauce chicken, and a more mild and sweet sauce. It was tender, juicy, and good. The sauce isn't overpowering, some may like it, and some may say it lacks flavor. I think it's just right. I'll definitely come back to this place since I don't live to far. I just hope to not be here to often to gain some extra pounds.  #CERTIFIEDBANGER"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving them less than 3 stars because the little boy who works there is very nice. He seemed like one of those owners' son who has to work because their parents make them do it. The price is really expensive. I don't know why the noodles and octopus cost $24.99! Even if I eat from all you can eat BBQ, it would cost lesser for unlimited food.  The little boy didn't know that if the customer's water is low, he should refill it. There were only 3 tables there. The chicken are expensive too. You can see from the menu. The food didn't taste the great. The banchan were little, as seen from the photos I posted. The only thing I may recommend, although I never tried and don't know how large, is $5.99 topokki. I haven't seen a restaurant that sells topokki except for the old Asiana market. They used to sell it before."}
{"text":"So happy to see a Korean Fried Chicken KFC place open up! We ordered the combo crispy and soy garlic chicken. Wow, delicious! The soy garlic had a nice tang, sweet and garlicky. I preferred this one over the crispy. The crispy was good. Crispy but not greasy and I really liked the little dish of seasoned salt they serve on the side to sprinkle on the chicken. I am guessing a combo of salt and white pepper? Also came with a dish of pickled, diced daikon.  Overall I left satisfied and happy! I will be back! Give it a try you won't regret it. FYI, the fried chicken takes about 20 min., be patient it is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is your newest Korean style chicken.  Come on over and get your cravings filled.  The owners have made their special sauces and also do other popular Korean entrees.   Come and celebrate Korean goodness into your tummy."}
{"text":"Came within the first weeks of grand opening and of course service and food were slow.  As usual, I give them a pass if the food is redeeming.  The Korean fried chicken was very crispy but I'm not sure I was able to taste the signature \"double fried potato starch\" that supposedly distinguishes it from any other fried chicken.  I remember it being very distinct when I had it from the popular place Bon Chon in California.  The garlic flavor was good but too salty.  Definitely need to eat each bite with some pickled radish to offset saltiness.  The spicy sweet one tasted better but still a tad too salty.  Maybe because they are very drenched in sauce.  I am very conflicted about the abalone porridge...the picture on the menu clearly advertises large slices of abalone completely covering the top of the porridge.  What came out was just porridge with no abalone in sight. I should have taken a picture of the menu pic vs reality.  After very close inspection and tasting, I was able to find extremely small sunflower seed-sized or smaller pieces of abalone.  What false advertisement...I almost wanted to complain but knew it wouldn't make a difference.  However, the porridge tasted soooo amazing.  The flavor was ultra savory and thick!  Though I would want to eat it again, I don't know if I can justify paying $13 for a bowl of just rice and water.  Really wish they at least put half as many abalone as their menu shows."}
{"text":"Came in.. see plenty of empty tables and was told they're too busy in the kitchen and was told to leave.. yeah what a great way to start your business..  what a waste of my time.. didn't even get a sorry or anything."}
{"text":"Finally we have Korean fried chicken in AZ. I'm so happy because it is so delicious!  Best KFC in AZ!"}
{"text":"Great example of authentic Korean fried chicken.  Don't let the pho sign fool you, look for the Po Chicken banner and dig in!  Clean family restaurant serving great chicken."}
{"text":"Love their chicken. Yet to try other dishes. We have lived in Korea for 3 years, hence were craving for Korean fried chicken. They need to offer home delivery ASAP!"}
{"text":"My beautiful wife and I came here for lunch on Sunday. Not busy at all. We came for the KFC. Was disappointed they did not have wings but they did have the whole fried chicken.  We had a half and half spicy and half soy glarkic chicken.  Amazing. So delicious.   We also had a  spicy pork hot pot. So good.   Service was 5/5. This place seems to be run by a family. The parents cook the food and the son and daughter were waiting tables. So good to see this type of family business. Food was 5/5."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service of the owner. Super friendly owner. He didn't let us order some of the menu items because the ingredients that he bought wasn't of quality meaning he knew that quality is important to his customers.   I would argue the price is average for the fried chicken considering the size of the chicken wings were gigantic and really crispy. We tried all three flavors, and only two stuck out for us to buy again. We also bought a dokbokki, but because he lacked fish cakes, he didn't charge us which is really nice of him. We wouldn't have minded paying for it because the size of the dokbokki was larger than most places   The only reason why I'm giving the total experience a 4 star overall is because despite it being filling and sensible service, the food was pretty average in terms of taste. There wasn't anything that made us go \"mmmmm\" except how crispy and juicy the chicken was."}
{"text":"Wow...finally a authentic KOREAN fried chicken & porridge  in Phoenix.  Taste will sure to get you back for some more...guarantee!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and was really pleased with the food. I had the crispy chicken and sweet and spicy as well as pork cutlet and all was fantastic. Especially the chicken. You can tell their meat is fresh and cooked to perfection. Super juicy. My friend had the porridge with Tuna. It was his first time and he enjoyed it as well. Definitely check this place out even just for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing. Love it. You'll see reviews talking about how great the chicken is, they're not lying! I'm sure the other choices on the menu are great as well, but the fried chicken is well worth the cost. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Compared to some other places I've been in NYC or LA I'd say the chicken is so so. They fry it made to order so there is a little bit of a wait which isn't so bad. The batter/skin is crispy but a bit on the thick side and not the shattering double fried crunch I look for with KFC. That being said the porridge here is tasty and authentic! We came for the chicken but really the winner here was the other dishes. Will definitely be back to try the steamed egg and spicy tofu soup."}
{"text":"I was hoping finally there'd be a legit KFC place in town. It's my favorite food and I go to ktown in LA just for it. Sadly, it's not legit KFC. They use wheat flour."}
{"text":"Very tasty bowls and the fried Chicken is excellent. My favorite is the spicy and the sesame chicken. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I debated between 3 and 4 stars for a while but ultimately decided on 3 because I highly doubt I'll return. The food was decent and if I didn't live so far away I might come more... But it wasn't SO good that I'd crave it and make a special trip out, or choose it over the other amazing restaurants in the area.   We got the Type C, with Yang Nyeom and Ganjang chicken. The Yang Nyeom was really good. Kind of like a sweeter general tso's chicken and more spicy. The Ganjang was meh.. didn't really taste the garlic flavor and it just tasted like regular fried chicken, but saltier.  One thing I really like about the chicken is that they have some kind of magic in the breading that keeps the chicken extra crispy. I got this for takeout and my house is like 30 min away and by the time I was ready to eat the chicken still had a good crunch.   We got the hot pot rice with spicy pork too, which was reeeeally good, although the portion was teeny. Pork belly was really soft and it was sautéed in a lot of gochujang. Went great with rice and would have loved to have more.   Some reviewers complained about the pricing, which I agree is outrageous for some of their dishes, but for the chicken I think it's actually okay. For a single order you get a whole bird. If you think about getting fried chicken from any other restaurant it's minimum $13-15 and only comes with two or three pieces. They give you enough to feed 3-4 people for $19-20.   Agree that I'd like to have bigger portions or more variety of banchan. The whole order came with like three pieces of kimchi.   I think it's definitely worth trying but kind of a one-hit wonder."}
{"text":"loved it. went expecting wings and im pretty sure i got an entire fried chicken. never had it in this format but it was damn good! you just have to be careful with the bones, if you arent very familiar with the anatomy of a chicken there are some different parts here. all delicious though!! we got the combo sweet & spicy wings with just standard fried chicken. both are great! sweet & spicy wasnt too spicy at all, but we caked on some hot sauce and it made it more to our taste. overall 10/10"}
{"text":"This place is relatively new. They turned off the lights so we weren't sure if they were able to sit up to eight people. But they did turn on the lights in another room which is pretty big and great for a bigger parties. We ordered several Congee selections. They were all pretty good. Then we ordered the special chicken dish which was a little bit spicier than expected. But it was still very good flavored. We did order a half and half of Korean Fried Chicken. We did get some rice balls. And two orders of steamed egg. All the food was pretty good tasting. But the service was a little bit still lacking. The selection for drinks is very limited. Hopefully they work out the Kinks in their service and offer more drinks."}
{"text":"Recently found out about the restaurant thru some friends snap chat. As a foodie, had to find out first and try it out. We ordered to go the regular 7 pc wings. Takes about 20-25 minutes since Korean style double fries their chickens for that extra crunchiness.   The owner was very sweet and made sure we had everything in our to go food. Food seems to run out as it's a very popular place right now but call in and check out if they have their items available! Definitely will be going back here for Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"Best place to get korean fried chicken period.  The chicken here is on a whole new level than any typical American fried chicken, it's a life chain gin experience that will make you thin KFC stands for Korean Fried Chicken.  Wings and whole fried chicken are always on point. Their porridge is traditional Korean style and fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for dinner on a weekday (around 7:30pm). Was planning on ordering a half and half chicken but they were out of chicken besides wings (seems to be an issue in other Yelp reviews also). That was kind of a bummer but decided to try out the wings anyways since I've been craving Korean fried chicken (KFC) and there isn't another place like this in the area! I ordered an order of the crispy wings and an order of the yangnyum wings.   The wings took about 25 minutes and service was polite when I got there to pick them up. I like how they have other items on the menu like traditional Korean dishes (jjigae, bibimbap, etc.) and porridges that also aren't common for the area (vegetable, beef, seafood, abalone!). The chicken itself was really good! It was a bit oily compared to other Korean fried chicken I've had in my lifetime, but it got the job done and satisfied my craving. The side of radish also reminded me of my days eating KFC in Korea :')   I'll probably go back in the future once my stomach can handle that amount of oil again, so hopefully they have more than just wings next time! Happy to have a restaurant that specializes in Korean fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Had picked up a whole sweet and spicy korean fried chicken.  First of, i wanna give them credit on not over breading the chicken. And it was still crispy after being in the car for over 25 mins!  Its a bit on the sweeter side but, it sure was good!  I've missed kfc! (Korean fried chicken)"}
{"text":"Outstanding chicken.  Made from scratch on order...you can really taste the fresh difference.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not a fan, poor service, slow food delivery, and bare environment. We tried 3 different chicken dishes and they all were ok but nothing to go back to have again."}
{"text":"Po Chicken by Edgar Chimaek Poe  Once upon an evening dreary, while I pondered, hungry and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of menus galore,  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a buzzing,  As of some one suddenly texting, texting to my phone on the drawer.  \"'Po Chicken?\" it said,  \"Time for Korean fried chicken and even more!\"  *********************  So, we tried to go here a month ago but sadly, did not realize they were not open on Mondays. We truly had a case of the Mondays that day as we realized there would be no crispy crunchy battered fried chicken for us. Hey, first world problems amirite?  Luckily, when we arrived again on a Tuesday evening we had no problem getting a table, although the restaurant filled up pretty quick as more customers came in.  We ordered all three types of chicken (Yang nyeom, crispy fried, ganjang). Each had that lovely crispy crunchy crust that I love about good Korean fried chicken. The yang nyam was my favorite for its blend of garlicy sweet sticky sauce with a slight amount of heat. Each platter of chicken was a hefty size too with a good portion of chicken 2-3 people could easily share per plate.   Banchan was very simple and consisted of some sort of coleslaw and pickled sweet radish.   They were understaffed the evening when we went so service was lacking, but the ladies working here were very friendly and did the best they could to accommodate every table.  I took some of the chicken home and it still tasted great the next day. It held that super crispy crunchy texture to it and was tasty even eaten cold.   **********************  So, this Korean fried chicken beguiled my sad hunger into smiling,  By the delicious aroma and crispy outer coating it wore.  \"Though thy meat be first cleaved and raw, thou,\" I said, \"art sure be finger lickin',  Freshly fried and crispy chicken brought from the kitchen's store -  I asked, \"Tell me how many items we should request on the night's menu galore!\"  Quoth Po Chicken server, \"Always more!\""}
{"text":"With the opening of so many good new asian restaurants lately, it was clear that there was a lack of good Korean fried chicken places. Needless to say, this restaurant not only fills that gap, but also does it very well. Now, I don't need to drive back to socal everytime I want some amazing Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"Was extremely surprised and happy to find a Korean fried chicken place in Arizona. Very tasty and worth every penny. The chicken was hot,fresh and the sweet and spicy sauce covering it is delicious and very addictive. I have not tried the rice porridge but it looks really good and I'll probably give it a try the next time I come around. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come and other nice Asian restaurants and stores start replacing all the pawn stores and auto loan places that riddle mesa. It's nice to see a positive change being made in mesa."}
{"text":"Chicken was very good, very moist, and not oily or greasy. Sweet and spicy sauce was great not overly sweet and the heat was just right."}
{"text":"Comfort food all around! This was hidden gem when you want perfectly fried chicken and Korean porridge. It's also a clean place. There were so many options of seafood porridge- you can't go wrong! I will definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"None of the tables dishes were cleaned up, which should have clued us in that simething was up... we didnt get water until i went up and asked them again after 20 mins of no service. Food took close to 45minutes to arrive, and didn't get everything served for another 15 mins.  Around the 30 minute mark a couple who had arrived after us got up and left angrily, it was too late for us to go anywhere else   Food is alright, but on the pricy side."}
{"text":"A really cold and windy night just perfect to have hot porridges and Korean Freid Chicken (KFC). There has been an explosion of Korean restaurants lately in the valley from all-you-can-eat to various California Korean franchises. PO Chicken stands out due to the variety of porridge selections and freshly made fried chickens. There aren't many Korean places yet specialize in porridges and KFC in the valley so far. I'm sure they will be coming soon. The difference between Korean porridge and Chinese porridges are the style of rice, ingredients, but will still warm your heart just as if your Asian parent cook it when you're sick, or anytime.    As for the resturant, they have two sections. We walked inside through the main door and saw it was completely full. They do have more tables right next door jointed to the main area. I don't think the owner was prepared for the crowd. For being on Yelp's Hot and New list, the overall service was attentive. If you order KFC, there will be at least a 20 mins wait depending on if they are busy or not.   Our group ordered:  Seaweeds and oyster and beef vegetable porridges - The seaweeds and oyster looks interesting comes out green but one of my favorites. It really warmed my soul. After having the seaweeds porridge, I skipped the beef & veg. It was still good but the seaweed porridge flavor just overpowers the rest.    Steamed egg - It's not the typical Korean steamed egg. It was fluffy and so savory. The staff came out telling us they had to make another one since it wasn't hot enough. I think it was still pretty hot. They thrive on quality here!  Jjimdak (Soy Sauce Based braised Chicken) - It looks very similar to the Chinese-style chicken dish with a much more spicy kick in the dish. Beware it is spicy if you can't handle the kick even already at a mile level of spice!    Type B KFC: Half & Half - Crispy + Ganjang  (sweet & spicy) KFC - I would go with the sweet & spicy if you order alone. The original crispy chicken didn't have much flavor. The sweet & spicy sauce does make a difference.   Mekomnakjitukbegibap - misspelled (Hot pot rice with spicy octopus)  - A decent portion of octopus, definitely satisfying, and celestial!   See you soon, Po Chicken!"}
{"text":"Po chicken was spot on! The chicken was tasty and the portion was generous. My 2 friends and I shared 1 order of half n half and we were so full by the time we finished. My friends and I liked the combo we ordered, especially the soy sauce marinate. The chicken was so crunchy and without the heavy amount of salt from typical fried chicken. I would definitely come back to try the sweet n spicy flavor plus the congee looked very appetizing!!!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here. We are very pleased with the food and service. Every order were good portions and flavorful. We definitely could just live off with the KFC aka Korean fried chicken and a big bowl of white rice. Like Flossy Carter would say \" It's a GO!\" Support this place because they're hot and new!"}
{"text":"Bf and I went here for lunch on thursday afternoon. This place is somewhat new so we wanted to check it out and see if it's any good. It's a korean style friend chicken. They had other stuff as well like porridge.. We had the half and half, which was half soy and half crispy fried chicken. Both were danky! As in delicious, bomb, off the hook, etc. They also gave us sides which is salad. They're salad is pretty good too. I their love fried chicken so this place definitely is on my A list to go for chicken anytime I crave some. It was nice, crispy, juicy, and tastey! They have a good sized portion also. My bf and I didn't even finish the chicken we orderd and we shared. We took it to go. The service was also great. People here are very friendly. If we are nearby we will definitely stop by. If you Re in the mood for chicken, come try this place!"}
{"text":"Went to the only Korean Chicken place in Arizona. And if they had competition, would blow them out. The chicken was cooked perfect and fried to perfection. Nice flaky out side, and even with the sauce it didn't turn soggy. Definitely coming back soon. It may be a little pricy but worth it"}
{"text":"Overall: Definitely recommended Food:Great Food! Service: Great customer service Price: Decent  UPDATE: 3/21/18 I decided to order to go and they package \"To go\" order very very neat and with the most care. That's how you know that they think about their customers. I also posted pictures of the details.   Food: I ordered the crispy chicken wings, the spicy rice cakes, and beef and vegetable porridge. The fried chicken comes out fresh and hot. They were super juicy and it is flavored with a light Jordan spiced to it. The rice cakes were decent. I wish they were spicier. But that's just my preference. And the porridge was really good too. Nothing to complain about.   Service: the owner and son were very nice. They are kind and respectful. I can see they're doing their best running everything together. When my friend and I got there, the son told us that there were 18 people ahead of us and that they had a small kitchen. That was nice that the son gave us a heads up first. We waited which it didn't seem long at all even with 18 people ahead of us! Amazing job. But yes, I did hear that the chicken may run out sometimes. But I'm pretty sure this is just temporary until they get things rolling.   Price: the price for the food was decent. The menu isn't too huge with a variety of options. I believe my friend and I ordered a total of 4 items (crispy chicken wings, beef+vegetable porridge, rice cakes, and my friend ordered bean sprout soup) all was under $35 which was a great deal with a lot of food!   I definitely recommend trying this place. I would love to go back again."}
{"text":"If you love fried chicken, you HAVE to come here. It is hands-down the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. It's always super hot, super crunchy, and super moist. There's no such thing as dry chicken here. The wings are something I didn't know I was missing in my life. The porridge is good too! My 3 year old, who hates most food (especially meat) devours the crispy fried chicken. The service is awesome and the staff are friendly - seems to be a sweet family who own/run the place. Soon they will be serving beer! What better to go with friend chicken than an ice cold beer?!   Wishing this place great success, as I know if more people tried it, they'd be coming back every weekend like my family does! I'd be totally okay with waiting to eat here but hasn't been the case thus far."}
{"text":"I'm very excited to have a Korean chicken and porridge place in Arizona. They have places like this Los Angeles and now in AZ. Hooray for that!  There was a choice of half and half order for chicken so we opted for the soy/garlic and crispy chicken. It comes out fresh out of the fryer. Almost burned my mouth on it, lol! It was crunchy without being greasy. The glaze was really yummy, slightly sweet and savory. The wings and leg pieces were my favorite.  The abalone porridge was really good. Came out piping hot as well. At first glance it looked a bit small for the price, but their porridge is very thick than most. Since it's not watered down, it's very filling. The flavoring was spot on.   Their old style tonkatsu comes with savory sauce, really tasty with the rice. All the dishes tasted even better with the refreshing pickled radish and their cabbage salad.  I can't wait to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Chimaek!  Gimme that Korean fried chaaacken!  We got the Type A: Half & Half chicken with Crispy + Yang Nyum (sweet & spicy chicken), Mekomjeyuktukbegibap (hot pot rice with spicy pork), and two Abalone Porridges. We wanted to make sure we get one of each for their namesake --- Po(rridge) Chicken!   The chicken dish was amazing and was easily shared between four adults with leftovers even. The crispy chicken came with some seasoned salt on the side but was pretty bland overall. I liked the Yang Nyum chicken more as the sauce was sticky and sweet with a little heat. Both chicken styles had huge pieces of chicken so it was exciting despite the wait time. The porridges weren't ground breaking and they didn't offer much variety of banchan for the porridge either. As for the hot pot rice with pork, it was decent. The pork was delicious but I wish the rice ended up crisping up at the bottom.  The service was so-so. It was pretty busy so our drinks were never refilled and when one of the waitresses turned too sharply with the cart of dirty dishes, the bowls went flying all over and made a mess that ended up getting on our clothes. An apology wasn't even given. Eh! Come for the food but don't expect attentive service. I'll be back for the chicken."}
{"text":"I had lunch here. I ordered the seaweed and oyster porridge and the fried chicken. The porridge was thick and creamy. It was seasoned quite well. It tasted like the ocean. I love it.  The fried chicken was a little greasy but the sweet and sour pickled daikon was able to balance it out.   This is an unique Korean eatery. If you're tired of Korean BBQ and tofu stews, give this place a try. Your stomach will thank you."}
