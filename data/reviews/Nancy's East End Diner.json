{"text":"We went to Nancy's East End Diner on a Sunday morning. Most of the booths were filled, but we still received excellent service and personal greetings. I had the southwest scramble and my partner had the Big John breakfast sandwich  (I think that was the name) with Italian sausage. The food was excellent and it was great to know that some of the ingredients were locally sourced. The coffee was simply the best restaurant coffee I've ever had. The owner waited on us, which was a nice touch. She provided excellent service. We loved the decor and atmosphere. There was nothing negative about our experience whatsoever. We're recommending Nancy's to all of our friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!  The pancakes are pretty good, but a hangover helper makes this my favorite weekend spot. It's an omelette served over the best fresh-cut fries around. Also, they have sausage made out of bacon. Just let that sink in."}
{"text":"Nice place. Nice people. Good service. Pancakes were very good. One person with us had an omelet (peppers onions bacon) that was good as well. The breakfast sandwich was fair. Not much to it. And the traditional breakfast eggs, toast, sausage and home fries was just OK.  Greasy sausage patties. Home fries without peppers or onions. But they were happy to add some when asked.  And beware... The butter on the butter toast tasted like movie theater popcorn. Would go back and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is great and affordable. Had the Helen over fries. Very original place with friendly staff. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place was such a pleasant spontaneous surprise! We woke up this morning and thought \"let's finally try that Nancys place we pass all the time.\" It was very clean, friendly atmosphere, good coffee, good quick food, good prices, and they have parking. The man working up at the front near the register (should've got his name) spoke to us quite a bit and made friendly conversation. Definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"What's not to love, local diner, totally artisan breakfast sandwiches, retro atmosphere, but modern twists on classics. Grits and her specialized hangover-helpers are fav. Great couple owns the place, hired personable people. Nothing worse than a diner with disgruntled staff. This place is the 5-star diner of East End (yes, rivals Square Cafe and Point Bruge, just the atmosphere is totally retro diner, and not all Bistro looking ;)"}
{"text":"I went to Nancys once before right after they reopened with the new owners and it was really good, but I thought maybe it was just one of those 'I'm hungover so anything greasy is good' kind of days. However I went this weekend, stone cold sober, and dang. It's good. Really good.
I'd go so far as saying the best diner good I have ever had.
For starters the coffee is beyond legit. It's easily the best tasting cup of coffee I have had in a restaurant that wasn't a coffeeshop. I believe when we went it was Tanzanian Teaberry (Is that correct?). Then the food. My god, the food. I had the vegetable omelet but asked for it to be scrambled with homefries, and had rye toast. All great. All of it. The owner is amazingly friendly, rhe food is excellent, and THEY HAVE HOMEMADE PIE. Check it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I never went to the old version of Nancy's, so I can't say how the new version compares, but I certainly like it.  I'm a big fan of the fact that they have a lot of local and house-made items, and their chicken and turkey sausage and bacon options are great for those like me who don't eat pork.  The Fancy Nancy Burger and the Southwest Omelette are great selections to try, as are the ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"I noticed this diner when I was on the Vacant Home Tour last year and finally made it here one Saturday morning with my daughter. The place was busy which is always a good sign. There was no place to sit except at the counter when we entered. We took a seat and scanned the menu. My daughter ordered an omelet with home fries, and I chose the grilled havarti and apple sandwich on raisin bread. My sandwich was delicious...a great combination. The owner told me the apple butter gave it that extra taste boost. My daughter also gave high marks to the omelet. We shared the home fries which we would have liked fried just a little bit crispier. Conversation also made this diner quite enjoyable. We struck up a conversation with a 'regular' seated beside me. He showed me some interior pictures of the Singer House which I visited (outside only) on the Vacant House Tour. He also had some interesting pictures of the vault inside the Union Trust Building downtown. We talked about this Wilkinsburg neighborhood where he had grown up. We also talked with the owner about this diner which has been there for years but now under his ownership for only a year or so. Great place for breakfast if you're in the neighborhood. I plan to visit over and over and try some other items, especially dessert. The morning we visited, they were offering sweet potato pie; we were just too full to give it a try. Then there is the Leona's ice cream on the menu. All the more reason to go back for dessert."}
{"text":"If a Nancy's does not wish to put pride into their take out customers' orders than they should not advertise take out.  Furthermore when I leave work to get food, I don't always have time to return to the place if the order is not correct.  And on a personal note in today's economy all customers should be important to you.  And by the way I never asked for a refund and both orders were incorrect in fact I was placing another order and only asked that you as the business owner make it right by giving the homefries that should have been on prior order; so instead you would rather lose a customer over $2.49?  Maybe that's how you do business either way weather I agree or disagree it is never appropriate to be rude to a customer."}
{"text":"Love Nancy's! I try to get something different each time I go, but I end up always having to get a side of grits. I love friendly the staff is and how cute and quaint the place is. You should definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This diner is really homey and comfortable. It really is a local's spot and probably one of their favorites; many of the people coming in and out seem to know each other. I kept it traditional and had the Junior French Toast, and it was delicious. Also, I had pineapple juice which isn't really offered many other places. If you're in town and you want to eat where the locals eat, this is your spot! Oh, and to top it off, there is a parking lot right beside the diner---you don't have to park on the street!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  I have no idea what was in the pancakes but they are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love Nancy's ; the food and service is always awesome.   Cheap eats, close to home (Regent Square) without the Regent Square price.  The decor and tunes bring back memories of grandma's house, always a plus when stopping for breakfast.   It's small and privately owned, and they do great at keeping up with guest flow.  Bonus points that the owners snap back at those Yelpers that will always find fault in an establishment.   Do it for us in the service industry that can't!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. There is simply no other rating. My husband discovered this place because you can see it from the busway in Wilkinsburg. We went this morning and there is meter parking in the lot. Cost me 25 cents for 1.5 hours. Im not sure where else in this city you can get that kind of deal. Inside it looks like a true diner. It was clean and the staff were friendly. I ordered the southwestern omelette and my hubby got the italian scramble. Literally one of the best omelette's I have ever eaten in my life and super filling. I feel like a beached whale right now. 
Lets not forget that this pace is actually reasonably priced too. $17 for two of us. Yep we will be returning."}
{"text":"Can you say diamond in the rough?

As many times as I've been to Wilkinsburg, I never knew this place even existed. They are tucked away from the main thoroughfare and have their own parking lot. It was busy on the day I visited but there was no wait for a table.

Menu consisted of breakfast and lunch options. When I saw grits on the menu, I knew it would be righteous. Meals are cheap and service is great. My over medium eggs were cooked well with a couple slices of bacon to top it all off. The plates delivered to the other tables looked good too. Can't wait to try other menu items.

The staff here is just happy and show their appreciation for your patronage. A win in my book..I'll be back."}
{"text":"I special ordered a chorizo omelette, it was perfect! The home fries were excellent, and an awesome cup of coffee to boot. 2 thumbs up!!!! Very friendly owner, really takes care of customers. I'll be back every chance I get."}
{"text":"Went this morning for the second time. Also the second hour-plus wait after ordering. The kitchen lost our ticket. The food is ok for diner food, price is ok. They need to get a better kitchen management system.  The waitress was nice and they comped the coffee."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the heart of wilkinsburg!! Great omelets, the potatoes with peppers and onions are fantastic and they get their pastries from Dana's in homewood daily.  They also grind their coffee beans right when they brew. Can't say enough good things about this place!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich was great... honestly one of the best I've ever had. The potatoes were not my favorite. Coffee was diner-grade and OJ was bottled. Neighborhood is rough."}
{"text":"Got a take out and the service was excellent and fast.if you are around Wilkinsburg I recommend you give it a try. Oh and try the pie. Thanks to my coworker for informing me. Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three or four times and it hasn't disappointed. They have the best diner coffee around and the breakfast is really good too. The staff is very friendly and the prices reasonable. It's everything a small diner should be."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Just so good. Always hits the spot. The people here are so friendly. I come here as often as I can.  Its the best place ever!
I highly recommend the pancakes and sausage. I usually don't get sausage because it's just ok imo but there is something extra delicious about theirs. It is home made. Also the pancakes are perfect. Light and fluffy with just a touch of crisp on the edges. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Nancy's East End Diner is the Diner to end all Diner's. We love to thrift on the weekends and usually seek out a local breakfast place, and last weekend we stumbled upon this Jem. HOLY CRAP this food is AMAZING. I got the burger and fries with cheese. So delicious. So perfect. Get the fries with cheese. Trust me. You won't regret it. It was so good, we decided to go there again this weekend to try the breakfast food. I've been looking forward to it all week haha. 

Also, I love the Yelp replies to past comments. Don't be a jerk, this place is awesome. If your gonna gripe then you suck."}
{"text":"Coming from New Jersey, which has the most diners in the world, Nancys is one of the best diners I've ever been to. I thought the wait was long but the friend who took me there assured me that \"you can't rush perfection.\" It's so true.
The coffee was good, the rye toast was perfect, the crispy hash browns were crispy and filling, even better with peppers and onions. The eggs were perfectly cooked with the right amount of cheese and other fillings. The waitress was training but suggested I use two different types of hot sauce on my eggs-best idea ever. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I know where I'll be having breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food is good enough, and this place is super close to me, so I come back.

The one thing I don't like about Nancy's is the service. It feels very impersonal. The servers are friendly enough, but every single time I've been there, they just take my order, bring the food, then bring the check at the end. I'm always sitting without water, and not being asked if I need anything or if my food is ok.

I still keep coming here because the food is pretty good! :)"}
{"text":"Nancy's is a perfect place to stop for a quick and simple diner breakfast. For under $10, you can get a good cup of coffee, eggs, meat, home fries, and toast, which is a deal that can't be beat in the East End.

I would love to see Nancy's add a fresh side option to their breakfast menu. I realize greasy diner food is much of Nancy's appeal, and I'm rolling my eyes at myself right now, but sometimes I wish I could get a simple side salad or a quartered tomato with my breakfast instead of home fries and toast. A breakfast of purely protein and carbs can really hit the spot, but it would be nice to have the option of a lighter, more colorful breakfast."}
{"text":"Their coffee was tremendous the first time I visited, good but not as good as I recalled the second time around. Solid breakfast each time (try the potatoes with peppers & onions) and very good prices. When the Square Cafe is too crowded (always), give this place a try."}
{"text":"I hate to add this update. Sometime this winter The head cook at Nancy's left. The co-owner/owner's girlfriend took his place. Everything then went sharply downhill. I was a regular so I gave it three shots over a 3 month period, and unfortunately nothing changed. I'm hoping things are on an upswing now. Really liked that place. To make this more relevant, check out the most recent reviews..."}
{"text":"Nancy's is exceptional in every sense of the word. Incredible value, unlimited local coffee, wonderful people, delicious food, quick and attentive service, old-school diner charm, farm-fresh eggs, unlimited local coffee...

Go. Be full. Drink coffee. Pay 1/2 of what you'd expect."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Wilkinsburg! Ample parking, very friendly staff, great coffee. Try the grilled havarti and apple sandwich - heavenly. And homemade sweet potato pie!"}
{"text":"The Classic Breakfast was delicious! The eggs were done to order; sunny side up was perfect and so were the scrambled eggs. Home fries were yummy, and we could taste the freshness of the sausage. The bacon was crispy and very tasty. The coffee was outstanding. My partner and I will make sure that this restaurant goes on the list of restaurants to visit."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stopped for breakfast. I ordered the French toast and sausage . 2 pieces of French toast and a small piece of breakfast sausage. The French toast was ok, but the sausage was all dried out and over cooked.  The coffee was ok, but overpriced at $2.25.  Talk about prices... They charge $1.25 to substitute Mancinis bread....I have never seen that before.
The counter service was pleasant.
   Overall average food with prices a bit high considering the neighborhood & food quality ."}
{"text":"The restaurant is on the smaller side and there aren't that many seats, but there were a few empty tables so we were seated immediately at 10:30am on a Saturday. Food came out pretty fast; took about 10 minutes. I got the Fat Cat breakfast (eggs, homefries, sausage, and pancakes). I enjoyed the homefries more after seasoning it with black pepper and the pancakes were great (just wish they came out a little warmer). Boyfriend got the meat-o-rama (bacon, ham, sausage, and your choice of cheese) and thought it wasn't bad. He also ordered a BLT to go, but thought it was average when eating it a couple hours later. Overall, a solid place for brunch. The pancakes were the best part.

{"text":"Their omelets are small (only 2 eggs) and they have a shortened menu on Sundays, but if you are looking for a true greasy spoon diner experience, Nancy's is a good place for breakfast. Just make sure you get extra napkins to wipe up the grease, and go ahead and add an extra egg to your omelet. You'll thank me later. It's worth the extra $1.50. 

One thing that stood out from our breakfast that was atypical of a diner was the fruit cup. Fresh watermelon, strawberries, oranges, blueberries and grapes - also well worth the up charge."}
{"text":"An absolute delight and so near the Busway East.  A real 'Burgh original."}
{"text":"As you can see from my reviews, my wife and I are  on a constant mission to find the best breakfast diner. 
Prior to visiting Nancy's East End Diner this Saturday morning, Fred's Diner in Akron and Summit Diner in Somerset were the undisputed top. 
Nancy's has dethroned them both and it is now our absolute #1 diner regardless of state or location. 
Here are the reasons we have put Nancy's at the top of our list:
 
Overall Ratings:
Food Quality - Six Stars
Cleanliness -   Five Stars
Staff -              Six Stars
Price / Value - Five Stars


Food Specifics:

Home Fries -  Absolutely the best home fries we have found to date. Excellently cooked, fresh cut potatoes and the addition of onions and peppers that are also sliced and cooked make these home fries absolute perfection. 

Eggs -  Fresh, large and high quality eggs cooked exactly to order. 

Sausage Patties - Meat sourced from a local butcher in Bloomfield with your choice of regular or hot. Excellent flavor and nice portion size. 

Pancakes - Nancy's makes their pancakes \"crepe\" style, meaning they are thinner and have crispy edges. This is the same type of pancake that Pamela's in Pittsburgh is famous for but these are better. 

Coffee - Better than average and cup was kept full without waiting. 

Toast - This is the only item we would rate as \"average\" with the standard toast being small in size and nothing special. Nancy's offers Mancini toast for an upgrade but we did not try that option. 

Do not let the outside appearance deter you from giving this hidden gem a try, you won't be disappointed!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not fancy. No frills. Old school vibe. For a great value and good diner food, Nancy's is a breakfast/lunch spot to consider if you're in or around the East End...in Wilkinsburg (yes, really)! The Fat Cat fits the bill from sweet to savory and Nancy's Breakfast Special is the best deal for ~$5. Add peppers + onions to the home fries, but for the best version, swing by on a weekday - that short order cook is on it! The house coffee is also above average, but the mugs are small so drink up. Added bonus: buy some Leona's ice cream sammies to take home! Lastly, service is prompt and pleasant. Parking is ample (and free!)."}
{"text":"If you like old, small town types of diners, this is a surprising find in Wilkinsburg.  I happened to be nearby and found this on Yelp.  The decor is a bit dated - but not bad at all.  Menu is fairly typical small diner fare.  I got a greek omelet with home fries and toast.  The food was simple and tasted homemade, and the homefries were tasty.  Interestingly, I got them with peppers on it, and the peppers were generously piled on top - but had a slightly tangy, vinegar like taste - from that and the texture, they seem to have been pickled.  It tasted a bit odd - but it was still very tasty.  From pictures other Yelpers posted, I have seen home fries with fresh peppers, so maybe they just ran out?  

This is a simple, reasonably priced little diner in Wilkinsburg, that also has plenty of parking - a nice plus for me for this type of place.  It is a metered lot where I think 1 quarter bought me 1 hour and 15 minutes.  The best part about this place was the staff.  Anyone can tell immediately that I am not from the area - and I can sometimes been stared at like an alien when going to some of the smaller towns around Pittsburgh.  Here I felt comfortable and welcome, and was greeted with smiles.  I will go to this place again when I am in the area.

Also, they serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Now my favorite spot for breakfast or lunch on a quiet day off. Gobbled down a huge breakfast followed by sweet potato pie with ice cream, all washed down by the best diner coffee I've ever had. I'll be making this one a regular stop!"}
{"text":"J and I came here for breakfast a few weeks ago. We liked that there was a parking lot next to it, since parking is a major plus/minus in my book. The atmosphere was pretty nice. There were two counters for people to eat, plus about 7 booths that reminded us of old schoolhouse seats. It was pretty busy and we were surprised we were seated so quickly. J ordered coffee and the classic breakfast with bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, and home fries. I had mint tea and an omelet with toast. Everything was pretty decent. What really struck us was how friendly everyone was. There was a guy who was picking up breakfast for elderly church goers. He seemed to be a regular because he knew the staff on a first name basis. Before he left, he purchased a meal for a homeless woman, which really touched us. If people like that frequent this place, it is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but kind of ordinary. Prices are higher than most other diner type places in western PA. I saw a lot of references to Mancini's bread. I've grown old on Mancini's, so I ordered that with my breakfast. I was surprised to see an upcharge on my bill.  Note to owners: If you are going to charge almost as much as a loaf of fresh bread for two slices, you probably shouldn't use the tiny little end cuts. $10 for the most basic breakfast (without a drink) in a dirty place? No thanks.I can do way better in most any other neighborhood in the area and still get the character."}
