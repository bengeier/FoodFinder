{"text":"Good fast Mexican food right on green st. They make their own hot sauces and have margaritas and Jarritos and horchata. Friendly guys behind the counter if you like futbol it's always on."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious mexican food for a cheap price. Must try to queso!"}
{"text":"Alright, I have to be completely honest here. I am conflicted giving this review because I typically have a fancy taste and the restaurant is kind of...well, whatever the opposite of fancy is. But if you're looking for a good ol college meal, this is the pick to click. Burrito king always pleases! Maybe just don't bring your parents if they're looking for a nice Mexican dinner"}
{"text":"If it were possible to give this place 1/8 of a star I would. Quite possibly the worst burrito/food/slop on a plate that I have ever consumed in my life. They cover your burrito in a liquid cheese that's absolutely disgusting without telling you that's how it comes. I ate this while under the influence of alcohol and am this strongly opinionated on how bad it was. Imagine if this was eaten while sober? I would suggest eating the gravel off the side of the street before entering this place. I'm going to stop typing now because thinking about this atrocious burrito is making me nauseous."}
{"text":"They're a great place to eat at after hitting the bars on green- they're open until 3am practically every school night. The food is really hit-and-miss, though. Some times it's been amazing and some times it's been really crappy. The one amazing constant has been their chips and salsa. They give those for free with your food- their salsa is 100% better than maize's and that's saying something. Absolutely love the recipe!! I've had deliveries from Tortica's over 6 times every month. I would always ask for extra chips and salsa, and they would oblige! Prices are really cheap too."}
{"text":"I have trouble admitting it, but Torticas is probably my favorite place to eat in all of Champaign. What I enjoy most there is the bang for your buck. Never before have I gotten so much food for so little. Not to mention, the food is amazing. Now granted, I have a very, very favorable disposition to Mexican food. But there's just something so wonderful about getting a massive burrito covered in queso in a flimsy to go box, accompanied with a small, greasy brown bag of complimentary chips and salsa (delivery). 

Overall, 5/5. This place is a hidden gem in my opinion."}
{"text":"Pretty good mexican food for being in a small midwest town. I'm used to authentic mexican food from places in Chicago, but this one is pretty good. I had acapulco, which is chicken, steak and shrimp with rice and some kind of cheese sauce. SOO GOOD! My only complaint is that there wasn't enough shrimp, but everything else was top notch. I got delivery and it only took around 35 minutes to get to my house. I'm totally gonna eat here again."}
{"text":"Great Tacos! Good salsa and chips! Will be back for sure. Fresh ingredients. Been twice and the food was just as good as the first time!"}
{"text":"10 out of 10 experience. The food was very good and inexpensive and the delivery was spot on to the estimated time they email you."}
{"text":"The food is nasty, even if you're hungry and drunk.
Tried Tacos and a burrito.
The tacos were meh and the burrito is lacking in meat, was breaking apart and no longer became a burrito. 

With the other reviews, the place is nasty. Mad grimy."}
{"text":"Visited in June 2013

Me and a friend walked in. 
Me and a friend sat down and were given menus.
Me and a friend saw pieces of old food everywhere under the plastic on both menus.
Me and a friend handed the menus back.
Me and a friend walked out."}
{"text":"Taste-wise, the burritos & quesadillas that my friends ordered are alright. Not worth coming back for.
But what really upset me was the service. 
I ordered one thing and they gave me another. After telling them that this is not what I ordered, it is then that they decided to let me know that they did not have what I ordered, so they decided to make me another dish.
Though slightly upset, as a non-picky eater, I decided to try whatever it was that was on my plate... and it was just not good. Greasy, salty and definitely non-authentic.

Definitely never coming back here again.. everything's better at Maize"}
{"text":"No thanks.

Normally I try to go to a place a couple times before writing a review, but I don't want to go back.

I was feeling sick today (a wintery day after the students have left for the semester) and went looking for comfort food.  Spicy food seemed like it'd be good for congestion, and I hadn't tried Torticas.  Well, Torticas was closed, so I continued down Green Street to Burrito King.  I remembered how the reviews were kind of mixed here on Yelp - either really high or really low - and decided to check it out.

The good: The server was quick and polite, and I had horchata right away.  And a basket of chips, which were the best part of the meal.  The prices are pretty much in line with a campus place, maybe a bit cheaper than some..

The rest: I tried to order a torta but I guess they didn't have any.  I ordered the fajita burrito instead, because it's in the name and since I didn't see anything about cheese sauce in the description.

Comes out with cheese sauce.  Smells kinda strange - almost like plastic?  The veggies just taste weird and are not crisp at all.  The meat is chewy and also has that weird taste that reminds me of plastic or chemicals.  Cheese sauce is really no good - salty but not much else in terms of flavor.  

I ate about a third of it, trying to make sure I didn't just get a bad bite or something, but it tasted strange and unappealing.  Other than the weird flavor, it was pretty bland - and no hot sauce on the table at all, which is weird for a Mexican restaurant.

I like Taco Bell (sometimes) so the food smelling like chemicals isn't always even a deal-breaker.  However, I also like Mas Amigos and Taco Loco for their cilantro and onion tacos and spicy flavors - and would definitely recommend them, or even Taco Bell, over Burrito King.  If you like food like Mas Amigos and do not want the most midwesternized Mexican I've had, then don't go here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem nestled along green street. Do not let the exterior fool you; this place is very authentic and delicious. There are large portions for a very good price and the monster margaritas are to die for. The service is always quick and friendly and even though this is a drunken staple, it is actually very good for dinner with friends. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting some good and cheap Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very salty, average burritos. Nothing special here. Does not hold a candle to Chipotle or Maize."}
{"text":"Two of three meals were correct. Veggie Fajita quesadilla, veg burrito, shrimp burrito ordered, but received a very meaty burrito instead of a veg fajita.  It was a delivery to people staying at a hospital, and it came with no napkins, silverware, or straws. The horchata was flavorless. Chips were good, guacamole very good, salsa more of an Italian red sauce. Very disappointing overall."}
{"text":"I first visited Burrito King (now merged with Torticas Grill) based on a recommendation from a friend, and I was not disappointed.  The combo meals are a great value- you can get a relatively authentic meal of two tacos, rice, and beans for $7 out the door, or a bigger platter (my choice was the burrito, enchilada, and tamale) for just a little bit more.

Sure, the value and authenticity are great, but the one thing that will keep me coming back is the chorizo.  The really smoky flavor is among the best that I have had.  The chips and salsa (possibly made on-site?) are also really solid."}
{"text":"I was lured by the $5 burrito hooked deal.

It was huge, but tastes very mediocre. I would rather pay 2 dollars more for chipotle next time."}
{"text":"My favorite place on campus to get late next Mexican. They are always open late which is perfect because you can hit up the bar and then head over for some Mexican. I always order a vegetarian but without mushrooms. Whenever I order for delivery they rarely get my order correct by putting mushrooms in the burrito. Other than that it is a great place for Mexican."}
{"text":"You definitely get lots and lots of food for the price. The Prince could have easily fed two of us. Unfortunately what they provide in portion size, they lack in flavor. If you avoid Mexican food because you worry about the spice, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to delivery choices in Champaign. I order from them a lot and my experiences have been a little mixed but for the most part yum-yum-yum satisfaction.

Pros:
- Most of the food I've ordered from them has been super delicious. Can't speak to authenticity but I sure can speak to how much I enjoy putting it in my mouth. Especially like the chile relleno, the tamales, the salsa*, and anything involving the cheese or ranchero sauces.
- Good beverage options. Love the horchata.
- Really reasonable prices. For most menu items, the portion sizes are quite large.
- Service is really friendly, which matters to me, even if they aren't always perfect.
- Open late.

Cons:
- Sometimes the tortillas on my enchiladas are not very good, kind of stiff and dry. Not sure if they are stale as another reviewer suggested, or overcooked, or if it is something to do with sitting around in the to-go container for too long. The shredded beef and chicken are also not quite up to par with the rest of their food.
- Have had occasional issues with service -- communication difficulties, missing complimentary salsa, a weird Campusfood.com-related snafu, trouble finding my easy-to-locate apartment door. All pretty minor and rare though.

A note on delivery: all delivery orders come with complimentary chips and salsa, but you get a ton of chips and only a little bit of salsa. You can order extra salsa as a side, though, as well as the cheese sauce. Those two mixed together = heaven.


* It's very cilantro-heavy, which I LOVE but I know there are some genetic mutants out there who taste cilantro differently. If you are one, this isn't for you."}
{"text":"What a treat! I ordered the Burrito Prince for $5.99 with spicy pork, and it was so authentic. There were even those little bits of pineapple in the pork like they make it in Mexico. I also tried my friend's Carnitas Burrito Prince and think that was my favorite of the two. Plus, the burrito was HUGE and came \"wet.\" The chips were light and fluffy and obviously homemade, and the salsas were delicious. I have been stuffed since lunch today and don't think I have room for dinner. Honestly, I can't imagine how large the Burrito King is, you would have to be a very large person to eat it I think (and I have a BIG appetite!). I really want to try the other dishes on the menu because they have a lot more than just burritos. They also deliver it turns out, so I will likely be eating a lot of food from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and trying to find a good Mexican restaurant I found this place and their burritos were so good! Their horchata was made fresh when we ordered! Definitely ordering again"}
{"text":"I placed an order with specific instructions, which they messed up ! I then tried calling the restaurant and could not get an answer!!! Horrible service"}
{"text":"Huge portions for the price and most things come with chips and salsa and tortillas too. Perfect comfort food for when you just want to get food coma and watch Netflix. Also great for hangover prevention in my experience. I never wake up with a headache when I eat here after a night of drinking. Server and staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"I am new to campus just being hired here at the U of I, so finding close places for lunch was a priority of mine.  I stumbled upon Burrito King one day and boy am I glad I did.  I first found their truck that lingers around Green St.  I tried their namesake, a burrito, and man, they earned their name.  I got the chorizo hold the onion and it was magnificent.  The next week, I got the chicken, next I got the steak.  Yep, there's a trend.  Each time, I was blown away.  Once students were gone, I was disappointed to learn the truck was no more.  Finally, I discovered during my walk an actual restaurant.  So, I leapt inside and ordered the Super Nachos with chorizo. While a brilliant idea food wise, a terrible idea walking back to the office wise.  I could only consume, maybe, half and what I carried back weighed at least two pounds.  It was heavenly.  Today, I ordered online for takeout, $4.99 two tacos, rice and beans.  YEP $4.99 TWO TACOS, RICE AND BEANS!!!!!.  Once again, Burrito King was excellent.  The food was ready in the 20 minute window I was provided, it was still hot when I got back to my office and it was delicious.  If you're a fan of good Mexican food, give it a shot.  If you like some heat with your food, definitely get the hot sauce.  It'll light you up and still leave you smiling."}
{"text":"What better way to end a night out drinking with your boyfriend than a Mexican food stop? Burrito King was close and on our walk home so we decided to give it another try. My boyfriend having had it before, being only semi impressed, I had not had it prior to that night. 
 I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was actually pretty good for being a little hole in the wall college town mexican place. Was fresh and came with all the fixins, sour cream, guac, and lettuce on the side. I don't recall what my boyfriend had gotten, but I do recall him sayin that his experience this time was far better than his last. 
  Burrito King overall was a little below average. But when you're drunk on a Saturday night, it's pretty damn good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for the price. They give huge portions, and it tastes amazing. I don't usually eat in store, but from what I've seen the service looks good. You can occasionally find their food truck outside of Loomis, and at night outside of Joes"}
{"text":"ok, i Love the salsa here and would have it over just about anywhere in town.  The fajita quesadilla is good, but really messy.

Had the nachos and was turned off, the chips work well for Salsa, NOT well for Nachos if that makes any sense.

Also, a notch off because the place is FILTHY."}
{"text":"I am so happy this place delivers! Their chips and salsa are delicious, my friend ordered the steak fajitas and I ordered the enchiladas. They were very generous with the amount of meat they give with the fajitas, for only $10 it was a very good deal and it was very tasty! My enchiladas were o.k. but I wasn't expecting them to be anything spectacular. A lot of Mexican restaurants here don't use real cheese and thats a big pet peeve of mine. They were like Dos Reales enchiladas. So now that the Dos Reales on University is closed (the new place is still good, but a little more expensive, and they charge you for extra tortillas, and they only give you two, wtf!!!!),
give Burrito King a try, they're good, cheap, close to campus and they deliver!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Burrito King via GrubHub a few nights ago. Food arrived hot and the portions are massive! My husband got the Burrito King, seriously it's huge, can easily feed 2 people. Also ordered the enchiladas supremas which weren't bad, it was terribly messy though in its container, it's I think 5 different enchiladas, couldn't tell which was which, too much sauce too. Steak fajitas were good, again very large portion, you'll need extra tortillas. I would order or dine in again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The complimentary chips and salsa is the best I've ever gotten at a Mexican restaurant before. The chips are very thick and the salsa chunky. I've had the tacos asados, highly recommend! I've also had the regular chicken quesadilla which was also amazing. It's rather inexpensive as well so that's a plus. Check it out! Very friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good! I bet it would taste even better if it weren't lukewarm by the time it is delivered. Each time I've ordered delivery it takes over an hour and I always end up walking out of my apartment building to find they aren't at the right address."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night around 7 PM so it was pretty busy.  Started off with their free chips and salsa which was some of the best that I've ever had in my life.  The only problem our group had was when we found some dead mosquitoes in the bottom of the chips basket. But, after we ordered another helping 'easy on the bugs' that seemed to take care of that problem.  Would have probably grossed out some people, but were in college, and were broke, and it's free, so what can ya do? The food was good and cheap with a pretty generous serving and the staff was friendly and attentive. 

Bottom line: Good Mexican food if you don't want to make the trip out to Dos Reales on Prospect, but if you have a car, that trip is worth it every time."}
{"text":"Excuse my french, but this is the fucking most disgusting Spanish food I have ever tasted! The meat is ass! Taste like fucking rubber! The Guac is so runny. Place is fucking dirty! It took them fucking 1 hour to make 3 tacos! When I got them, it was the wrong  fucking order! Some fucking kid walked in drunk with no shirt and ordered his food, sat there and ate his food and no one cared to say anything to the kid! That place needs to be shut down not only because it's so shitty but the food is fucking TERRIBLE!!!! ON MY SOUL! The only reason I gave it a 1 star is because I cant rate it with no stars! SMH"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos!!!! I love the relaxed atmosphere for a nice college dinning experience. Cheap too"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful little burrito place. Friendly staff and delicious food! I frequent here about once a week. They have a hooked up special that is almost always there for a 6 dollar burrito. Best burrito place on campus!"}
{"text":"If there's one thing that is difficult to do, it is fuck up Mexican food. With that being said, to do it on a consistent basis is truly a work of art. You might expect this review to be one star based on that statement, but I'm extremely impressed by how consistently shitty this food is. 

That's where the five stars come from. The consistency. I consistently hate myself for coming here. I consistently find the food very sub par. I consistently have the servers being unable to communicate properly, and I consistently see the obese delivery driver playing Angry Birds on his phone. Unfortunately, Dos Reales is a ways away, so I'm stuck with this diarrhea soup of grovel disguised as Mexican food.

In a world where all is changing, it brings me a sense of comfort that Burrito King is consistently shitty. Lose your job? Getting a divorce? In the midst of a bunch of crappy fluctuation all part of this shithole called life? Come to Burrito King with low expectations, and those low expectations will consistently not be met.

Five stars for being of beacon of everlasting shit in a sea of change."}
{"text":"Came here hunger pang laden and left in a food coma! My first visit here definitely surpassed the expectations I had. The people working there are very pleasant and the servings are gigantic while the prices are very nominal. The food tastes fantastic - hence the overeating on my part. The sitting area isn't the best it's kind of dated but not the worst. A lot of people were opting for carry out as well so whatever works! Oh and the food came with a serving of tortilla chips which were fresh, crispy and warm so I'm guessing they were made in house."}
{"text":"If I die young, bury me in queso.

Queso from Burrito King (or Torticas, or the Burrito King truck...) will easily be the most delicious queso you have ever had in your entire life. The queso dreams are made of. The queso that makes the world go round. The queso that Burrito King smothers on everything...

I love this place. Fantastic staff, good chips and salsa, big portion sizes, veggie options. And did I mention the queso? Whether it's 2 pm or 2 am, this is the place to be. And if it happens to be sometime in between 2 and 2, they have a bunch of different flavors of margaritas, but they are a little pricey. 

Tip for the wise (or drunk, or reaaaaally hungry): if it's one of those nights that everybody has the same great idea as you and the restaurant is packed, order your food to-go! They'll even let you snack on chips while you wait - the best.

Another thing to note: The Burrito King truck only accepts cash. Don't get mad, don't cry about it, the restaurant is literally a block away. Seriously, don't cry about. Seriously.

Five stars 'cause I'm in love."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get steak tacos!!!!! One of the best drunk food restaurants, and at a good price too. Chicken nachos are also delicious, and the portions are big enough for 2-3 people. Very friendly setting and one of the best Mexican restaurants around campus!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. The burritos are awesome and the nachos are huge. Cash only though!"}
{"text":"Mexican Approved (by a Flores)...Without the \"out with my gf/bf at 1am\" story.
 Also easy to find seating.

I recommend:
Steak Tacos + Tortilla chips + Rice + Beans. Simply yet tasty.

1. Chips are CRISPY--Like bitting into Lays...but even crispier. It's pretty insane.

2. Steak Tacos: Tasty. Simple ingredients (steak, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, etc) but they put the seasoning that really makes it good. Your typical taco joint suffers from blandness, but they seem to overcome that with good seasoning

3. Mexican Rice: Very cheesey.

I wouldn't call this 'authentic', but it's like cat food for a Mexican: cheap, tasty, and could prob eat it everyday (for health reasons of course, I wouldn't recommend it)."}
{"text":"When ever I'm drunk enough to order good from this place it's always a let down. Bad delivery and one time they didn't even wrap my burrito. Food isn't bad but everything else is subpar at best"}
{"text":"I ordered an el pastor burrito (spicy pork) which came with a side of chips and salsa. It was $6.50 and it was really really good! I also ordered an elote in a cup for $2.50 but I didn't love it. It tasted like something was missing and there was too much juice on the bottom of the cup. Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"Really excellent Mexican food, far superior to the other fare on Green St. The name makes it sound like an Americanized fast food place but it's actually more of a restaurant than Taco Bell type place, you can sit down and have a decent dinner. The service is extremely fast and prices pretty reasonable, considering most items are large and come with sides. Even the chips they give you while you're waiting and pretty good. I had the fajita burrito and it came drenched in cheese, with sour cream and guacamole on the side, you can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been raving about this place and that it's possibly better than Dos Reales.  Uh. Burrito King? Yes, the name is terrible and it sounds really shady but I wanted to see for myself. I have to agree with the previous review. The menu at Burrito King is very similar to Dos Reales, and they have same drill of greeting you, taking your order, and throwing some chips and salsa at your face... lovely. I thought the place wasn't too bad. It was a little cramp but hey, it's Green Street. I thought the mexican rice was flavorful... I didn't really touch the beans but my chicken chimichangas were pretty tasty. Maybe it's because it's a deep fried burrito. I mean,  anything soaked in fat is tasty. Anyways, I wouldn't mind going to Burrito King again. Plus it's a nice walk from campus."}
{"text":"I love Burrito King- it's amazing and delicious. Their service is awful in terms of timing. Pick up orders say they'll take 20 minutes and EASILY take an hour. This has happened every single time I've ordered there and it sucks but I keep going back because I love the food. Really hope they make some improvements with organization because their poor timing isn't due to being insanely busy. Le sigh."}
{"text":"Greasy food, and even if you tell them to hold the cheese they slather on the disgusting cheese sauce.  Maize is much better."}
{"text":"As far as late night noms go, it really doesn't get much better than BK.  Service, seating, prices, and quality; everything you want out of a late night joint can be found here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food on campus. I can honestly order anything on the menu and be happy. Not to mention that their salsa and queso sauce are to die for. My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week and we've never left unsatisfied. The staff is always friendly and the food great. I recommend the quesadillas - they're smothered in their amazing queso sauce."}
{"text":"I ordered Burrito King for lunch and had it delivered by Grubhub. The food was very good. My son had a large chicken burrito and it was huge. I think it could feed 2 people. He got a third of the way through it. I had tamales covered in sauce. They were good and I'm kind of picky about my tamales. They weren't all dry as they often are elsewhere. We ordered Queso for chips. We love very spicy food and this isn't spicy at all (think Midwestern Mexican cuisine!) but we have no shortage of hot sauces at home so we didn't mind. I would order again. It took just a little longer than the projected delivery time but I live in Champaign no where near campus so that was not bad at all. The delivery driver was pleasant."}
{"text":"I grew up in California loving Taco Bell. Sure I knew it wasn't real Mexican food, but I loved my steak supreme chalupas nonetheless. Fast forward 15 years or so to Champaign. College student me, with no car, had hankerings for Mexican food during the day or late night. Options? La Bamba's \"burritos as big as your head and later on Chipotle (yea I know, another bastardization, but still crazy delicious).

Oh, let me just make a point of it to say, I don't care how drunk you are, La Bamba's is one of those terrible life choices you can ACTUALLY regret -- my friend ate an entire burrito, walked outside, and threw up a burrito as big as his head.

On to Burrito King. As the name implies, the ethnic owners clearly were not wearing their creativity caps, and were also misinformed on the lameness of copying the name of some big American fast food chain like so many other restaurants have done, e.g. Pho King, Egg Roll King, Gyro King, etc. etc.

But the food? Absolutely fan-fcking-tastic. 

To start off with, I came in around 4 p.m. on a weekend so nobody was dining. The wait staff promptly set me up with a heaping pile of homemade nachos and salsa

I had the pork tamales covered in a creamy white cheese sauce and chorizo all over. They came with a side of rice and beans, delicious. Please PLEASE try the homemade habanero hot sauce. I only wish they would sell me some, although they did get a to-go sauce cup for me to sip on later ;]

The menu has scores of authentic Mexican dishes, including some run-of-the-mill options, but you'll find it all incredibly fresh and well made.

Prices are cheap enough to make any future stop in La Bamba seem like heresy now.

I wish Burrito King had come sooner when I was actually at UIUC, but learn from my mistakes and go check it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is ALWAYS a good call. You hear me? ALWAYS. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 

The price and quality of the food just can't be beat. The free chips and salsa are phenomenal, and there is always soccer on TV."}
{"text":"Very rude. I ordered for delivery and it took them an hour and a half to get a burrito to my house. The food was cold, and when warmed up it was lacking at best. Very little flavor and bad texture. When i called to contact the manager, the owner answered and hung up on me. Just go to Dos Reales if you want good Mexican food with friendly service."}
{"text":"I have sort of mixed feelings about this place.  I feel like the meal could have been great, but when I went, it was pretty terrible.   I don't like Mexican food to begin with, but I usually can be decently happy with meals elsewhere at the other Mexican joints like El Toro or Dos Reales.

Pros:
- cheap
- open to 3AM
- large menu
- great chips and salsa

Cons:
- workers didn't understand english well at all.  Had really difficult time ordering
- Food came out wrong, for all of our entrees.  I had ordered a chicken entree.  I hate cheese on my dishes and the entree's description did not list cheese, yet it came out smothered in cheese.  To be honest, the cheese was what ruined my meal.  It was extremely salty and i hated the taste of it.  I also asked for no beans, but I got them too.  The other entrees had similar issues.
- Way to salty.  Mostly the cheese sauce they use.  Disgustingly salty. 
- really tiny inside, only 10 or so tables.  Huge line in store of people waiting to sit down.  We originally were going to eat in, but had to order to go.... but a table opened up while we were waiting after about 15 minutes.

All and all, I felt the meal could have been really good, but really this place gets the low rating because of the bad service.  Had our entrees come out right, this could have been a totally different review.  They didn't though, they came out very wrong, and I felt asking the workers to replace the error would have not gotten correctly communicated anyway due to their lack of English. 

I probably just hit it on a really bad day, but I won't be going again."}
{"text":"I can only speak to their delivery service, as I have never actually eaten inside. Serving size is very generous for the price, and pretty much any entree can be split into two meals. Chips and salsa are included, but could use a pinch of salt. Delivery is quick and food arrives hot...avoid ordering the nachos, though, as they tend to get soggy. Buritos and enchilada plate are always good options."}
{"text":"Gave Burrito King a second chance after my very lackluster experience a few semesters ago and they definitely improved!

We came in at about 1:30 on Thursday, for a belated Cinco de Mayo/after hitting the bars late night bite.

They took our order and we waited about 10 minutes. The ordering is kind of weird, there isn't a counter or anything, you just walk up to the cashier face to face and tell her your order.

I got a pastor burrito and my girlfriend got a chicken quesadilla. My burrito was pretty big, the pastor tasted good and it also came with tomatoes, sour cream and corn on the side. It was also smothered in a cheese sauce which I didn't expect but added an unexpectedly good taste to the whole thing. The pastor was tasty and seemed to be of decent quality. Overall the burrito was surprisingly good. The only complaint was that I added avocado to it for an upcharge and I think they used a guacamole spread instead, not a big deal.

My girlfriend said her chicken quesadilla was good too.

Our meal was around $18 for two people, it was a good amount of food for the price but it seems like the cost of all food is going up, $7 is approaching Chipotle level prices.

Overall a good experience here, it seems like their late night options (burritos, tacos, quesadillas) are the way to go, I would avoid the more \"entrée\" type items availiable earlier in the day."}
{"text":"The place seems a bit messy, but at least the food is pretty darn good. The service is amiable and you get free chips as soon as you sit down. Great for anyone on campus that is seeking to fulfill their stomach with some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Quick Service, Friendly people
made to order items like fajitas, enchilada are VERY good
pretty cheap

bad chips - really thick and greasy
stale (think 10 day old) rice & tortila - the worst I have ever seen. 

The bad rice & tortillas ruin everything. I just ignored those two items and ate my very well cooked & delicious chicken"}
{"text":"This is a decent place with the exception of a few things. I've been here a few times and for a Mexican restaurant its average. The quality of the food is overall delicious. Free chips and salsa and the portion sizes were pretty big. The burrito quesadillas is huge. 

Any-who, the only problem I had was that when I was given the dish for the salsa it was not clean, so I sent it back and they gave me a clean one. My friend that I was with had the same problem. I would think they would check these things before they gave it out, but they didn't. 

The prices are okay and comparable to other places such as Chipotle or Maize. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall. Definitely a lot of food to go through. The steak is really soft and moist and really has some strong flavor. The ground beef is very juicy as well. FYI: free chips and salsa for all you people with the munchies. The wait-staff is very friendly, but there is a bit of a language barrier (our waiter came back three separate times trying to remember our order, and we only had a group of three)."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken fajita quesadillas. The chicken was like it was thrown on the grill for 30 seconds after being boiled. Grilled onions were also underdone. Overall, I regret ordering from here. Also, $10.85-ish for this felt like robbery. So no, avoid unless you're starving."}
{"text":"I ordered this on a whim and recommendation. I was at work and very hungry. So I ordered the King Burrito expecting a large burrito. When it got there and I saw it, it was a magnificent work of art. A huge, beautifully crafted piece. I ate a corner of this burrito before taking it home and giving the majority to my very hungry boyfriend. Burrito King knows what it's doing. And even though I ordered a 10 dollar burrito that ended up being 17 dollars after tax and delivery fee, it was well worth it. The taste of the burrito is pretty darn good. I got the pastor (spicy pork) and it wasn't spicy at all. That was a tad ddisappointing. It was more like a pork that had spices introduced to it. But it was still very flavorful and tasty. Also, free fresh fried tortilla chips and salsa. Great place to get a bite!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a refreshing step up from the typical Champaign Mexican experience.  I've eaten at BK three times and consistently was impressed with how fresh and tasty the ingredients were.  

The chips and salsa are very good, and each dish has had a great grilled taste.  None of that fast slop whipped together in 2 minutes.  Highly recommended for lunch or dinner."}
