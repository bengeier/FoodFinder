{"text":"We eat at Carlsbad about once a month. As a family we enjoy just about everything on the menu. The food is always fresh, perfect spice and flavorful. The service is always kind and prompt from our experiences. It's great to have a restaurant of this quality within walking distance!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  Love the Enchantment Platter. The Habenero burger is the hotest hamburger I have ever eaten.  Its awesome but beware!!!!"}
{"text":"Jeremy was our server and he  was exceptional. sitting out on the deck with friends was enjoyable. Small outdoor patio, family-friendly, but being outside you have the proverbial attack of the flies. Of course we could've dined inside and skipped mother nature's friends. We started out with The macaroni and cheese fried bites which were very crispy and a side of sauce for dipping pleasures with a quantity of six. Happy hour offered a wide variety of appetizers and drinks which we took advantage of. Our server was very conscientious of the timeframe before happy hour expired and kept us apprised of the time limit. Our dinner consisted of the steak fajita quesadilla which was fabulous. We also enjoyed chicken quesadilla and their nachos which could've fed a family of eight. For dessert we had the fried ice cream which was a caramel base ice cream with caramel drizzle & corn flake outer crust. On a 1 to 5 for the desert I gave it a one only because I did not care for the corn Flake outside crust. To me it was a little tasteless but my guest enjoyed it immensely. On a scale of 1 to 5 service was the five , food was a five ,drinks were a five, as well as appetizers. Again my opinion of the dessert was a one but I believe my guess rated it as a five with one abstaining with a three star rating. I would recommend this place A five and would return in the future because of the wonderful staff and ambience of being outside. Bon appétit"}
{"text":"When we came we got patio seating, which I'm grateful for after walking through the inside.  The decor is great but it seemed a bit dark (because of the cave theme) and a bit crowded.

Our food was good, we both enjoyed what we ordered.  The service was a bit slow as can happen when it's busy but our server was always polite."}
{"text":"Went here searching for the hottest and most delicious burger in AZ and I found it. The Habanero Cheeseburger paired with the Prickly Pear Margarita were absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Love this place and have for several years.  No the habanero burger is not as hot as it was before the fraud network.... ooops I mean food network came around.... if you have only one day at this beautiful culinary excursion..... with 4 people start with 1 habanero burger as an app cut into 4 for a group,  1 cup of posole as a mid entree sampler, then the Carlsbad is your oyster... for virgins get the enchantment platter.... the specials are always good too... I wont go on and on about every thing I eat there... 10 year non local veteran.  Nice people, great service, great food, strong drinks.... I have actually eaten lunch and dinner there without leaving.
Carlsbad, I love you."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere are the best part of this place. The chicken was dry and tough, the salsa was way too hot for anyone in my party of five (three of us really like some heat). Overall, the food was greasy, mediocre and overpriced. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Our group was there on Thursday...about 10 of us.  We shared a variety of all of the appetizer specials ... everything was delicious. They should probably have warned us about the habanero sauce that came with one of the dishes (sorry, can't remember which one)... but after the initial burn, it was really good.  (If you like really hot & spicy, the habanero burger is awesome!).  Our waitress was excellent!  While we weren't a very demanding group, our server was on-the-ball and very professional.  

The decor is very unique, as well...in keeping with the \"tavern' theme - there are bat-like designs everywhere.  If you visit during the cooler months, sit outside on the patio near the water or be sure to come at night and hang out next to the fireplace.  Fair warning, parking can be a bit of a bear as it is very limited. 

Overall, it's a nice place and good food."}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews. I am new to AZ and was looking for some good Mexican food. Well I must say the only good thing about this place was their decor and staff. I had their chips and salsa and added their $6 guacamole as well as their tequila shrimp. 

The chips and salsa tasted like it was fresh from a store product. Nothing special at all. Their guacamole was lacking flavor. You can make your own guacamole for half the price.

As my entree I tried their adovada plate. Again this dish lacked flavor and the sauce they cooked it in was just to spicy to enjoy. I only ate half and left the rest their. I can handle spicy food but this was just taking away from it.

If you find a good Mexican place please direct me there. Don't bother with this place"}
{"text":"The place did not disappoint. The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area.

 It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of)

But yeah, the portions were overwhelming, and best of all? The food was spectacular. I sat outside, but honestly? I think the place is pretty both ways, so don't be too stingy on the location :)

Jus go."}
{"text":"It was what I expected for a New Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. Good atmosphere, friendly service, less than  mediocre food. Came here on New Years Eve and I had the Chile Relleno which was bland and came with a dried up rice. The green chile had no kick to it. My buddy got the carne adobada and it was way too salty. 

I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've driven by a thousand times, yet have never been to. We went here after dinner and my date told me that they have a nice patio for drinks. From the road, it looks like any establishment, but as soon as you get to the entrance, it's like you're walking on the set of Pirates of the Carribean! It was really cool. The outside patio was designed to look like a beach front dock with a lagoon. There are two fireplaces on the lower patio with a bar in the middle. And then seating on a deck on the outside of the bar. Inside there is a bar and also high backed booths to fit two or four people. The ambiance of this place is unlike any place I've been to before. (note...I'm new to the valley!). The service was fast and courteous and the drinks strong! There's room for large groups outside and it's a very festive crowd. I'm going back there this Saturday for drinks with friends and encourage you to go too. 

I haven't eaten there yet, so I can only give the place four stars, but I loved this place. If I had friends visiting from out of town, this is the kind of place I'd take them too."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We went to Carlsbad Tavern on a cold November night and sat by the fireplace. Ambience is amazing, food & drinks great."}
{"text":"Visited tonight for the first time with a couple of guests, including one from out of town.  Hannah was our server and she was very attentive.  I ordered the carne adovada plate, and I must say it was fantastic!  The serving size was generous, it had great flavor, and came out sizzling - but without anything overcooked at the bottom, as can sometimes happen with a plate or skillet that hot.  Served with a tortilla underneath and another on the side, it was enough food that I used both as makeshift burritos while still having plenty to spare!  And while I am a fan of spicy food, this dish was actually quite mild, and would make a very good introduction to New Mexican cuisine.

The only reason I removed one star was because of the very loud, boisterous tables around us.  This isn't really the fault of the wait staff as they couldn't predict it, but the restaurant is divided into a dining room, bar space with booths, and outdoor seating.  They were putting almost everyone into the dining room, which meant we were seated between an oversized party at a long table and a small but extremely noisy group that came in sometime later and ideally would have been seated by the bar instead.  Once they started laughing, it became a bit of a shouting match between the two groups to hear over each other.  The outdoor area, however, was very peaceful and comfortable even in the evening heat thanks to the waterfall, fountains, and misters.  If it's a nice night, I would certainly recommend the outdoor seating for the ambiance.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Carlsbad Tavern for its uniqueness and delicious food."}
{"text":"Loved my meal here! I did a random search while on the road and found this gem. Finally good Mexican food that's actually spicy and flavorful! I ordered the Enchantment platter and was not disappointed. I enjoyed every bite, service was great and my drink was not watered down, hurray!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fresh served hot. Delicious!! I can't give this five stars because it was extremely hot and humid inside. I felt like I was in the Amazon. Server was ok.. Forgot an item we ordered. The place wasn't busy...."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale from Carlsbad, CA.  Came here with my husband and teenage son.  We each ordered something different and none of us really liked the food.  The tortillas served with the soup are the same served at Taco Bell.  The entre plates are a huge blob of reheated beans and rice. The saving grace was the sopa pillas.  I feel we wasted $75 for an unimpressive dinner and wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Sunday night my sister flew in from Canada. She wanted some authentic Mexican cuisine so I brought her to Carlsbad. We were served by Jeff who explained that the food is actually New Mexican cuisine, they use peppers in nearly every dish from hatch peppers to habanero and everything in between. Jeff mentioned that he was new to the restaurant and imediately I thought oh no... I thought our service would be slow but he really changed my mind quickly. He was very knowledgable about most everything and he really did an amazing job making is laugh. He suggested the brochettes and potstickers for appetizers which were very good. We also ordered the pasta dish with Chipotle chicken as suggested it was amazingly flavorful. Overall I would give our service and the meal 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I decided to write some reviews today of my favorite places.  I absolutely love this place.  I have eaten here probably 30 times over the years.  Every time was great.  So many things on the menu I love.  

One of my favorites is the lobster croissant.  Its so amazing.  And I love their side salad with house dressing instead of fries.  Not to say the fries are bad, they are good, but they have one of the better side salads with the jalapeño ranch dressing.  They have an awesome chimichanga if i am in the mood for something heavier.  I haven't had anything on the menu that I dislike, and  i have nearly tried all.  Their specials are always excellent.

The other thing I love is the atmosphere.  Outside is great, inside at the bar or inside the bat cave is cool.  They always seem to be playing 80s pop wave music which always cheers me up.  I am a fan of the 80s! Everything about this place is great."}
{"text":"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. Absolutely disgusting to find half of my burrito was filled with balls of fat. You'd think they'd take that off the bill? Not a chance. Other than that, it wasn't even tasty. Server was nice."}
{"text":"Ehhhh...

I was luvin up on the vibez with all the bat deco and waterfall but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food. The rice was undercooked, chicken was flavorless, and the beans looked like bat skat. The chimi was average and a tad spicy. 

Their bat brew was alright... A bit sour. My friend had a random ass vegetable in his burrito (broccoli). Maybe they thought the bat brew would help us forget but nah boo. 

Leaving the restaurant felt like exiting a Disneyland ride. Maybe if they put forth more effort towards the food than the atmosphere then maybe I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere. Came in Tuesday for lunch after running errands. Sat at the bar, the bartender was great. Had the Habanero Burger - I'm used to hot, it was very good. I think jalapeño bacon added (or,  dare I say, Habanero cured bacon?) would be awesome.

There is a good reason why they've been here 19 years. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not bad but disappointing.
Nice restaurant w/ a nice atmosphere but not what I was expecting or wanting. The food was pretty good but not a good Mexican menu. You have to order chips & salsa-salsa was not very good-not spicy at all. Staff was very friendly but took a minute to get the server to continue checking on the table. Overall not bad but would not suggest this restaurant if your looking for good, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Tex-Mex I've ever had. The fare is way over-priced and the margaritas are triple-sec heavy so there you go. If you want to pay too much for bad food and drink this is your place."}
{"text":"We recently celebrated my mom's birthday at Carlsbad Tavern. We had a situation where we had to change venues at the last minute and Carlsbad Tavern was able to accommodate a party of 20 for Sunday brunch. 

Once there, we were greeted by our server, Kenny, who was terrific! The other supporting staff were great as well.

The beverages were always kept full, our food was served all at the same time with only about a 20-30 minute wait (considering there were 20 of us!) and everything was delicious!

Highly recommend the carne adovada and eggs off the brunch menu. 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There should be a separate category for New Mexican food. The dishes might sound similar, but the flavors are different. They are proud of how hot they can be, but there is a brightness to the spiciness that is much more than just heat. Great flavorful food, served in HUGE portions. Seriously consider splitting full course dinners down the line so you can do appetizer, soup, salad, entree, sides and dessert, because it's all good!

Nice funky charming ambiance."}
{"text":"Was very excited to find a place that has good reviews on yelp , an offer and a Mexican theme restaurant. The food was nothing to brag about , was ok. My biggest peeve was that the yelp checkin offer was not honored citing a. Should have shown earlier b. Happy hour chips and salsa

That does not make sense as This was not mentioned in the offer. It's not a matter or free food but principle. First time ever my yelp offer was not honored. Not returning again as I don't believe the yelp reviews or yelpers are valued.  Disappointed !!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out a few years ago and it has since become a bi-monthly habit.  This place has a great Happy Hour that starts at 2pm.  The Filet Mignon tacos are phenomenonal!  3 large Filet tacos with a cup of beans for $8? (How can they do that) Plenty to eat at a great price.  The Staff is very friendly.  Neal and Art always provide a friendly greeting and check on you later to make sure all was good.  Tyler, the Happy Hour Bartender always provides 5 Star Service.  You can't miss him as he looks like the \"Justified\" Actor, Timothy Olyphant.  If you're looking for a great happy hour where you can eat and drink well at an awesome price with a great staff....Check it out.  Oh yah, the chicken quesadilla is ridiculously tasty, plentiful and only $5."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the yesterday. The food was good. The dessert on the other hand was a nightmare. One was frozen solid and the other tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for way too long. We told our server who apologized right away and told us it would be removed from the check. 5 minutes later he comes back and tells us his \"Manager\" refused to give the refund. We kindly asked for the manager. Judith strolls out and leans on the vacant chair at the table and says \"How was everything tonight?\" Shocked she didn't already know everything was NOT ok; I again began to explain, from the beginning, the issue with our dessert. She said she was sorry but she wasn't going to give us a refund. Judith said she tasted the dessert in the back and it tasted fine to her and that due to that an the fact that she felt \"more than enough was eaten\" from each plate  she figured we just wanted to get out of paying for dessert. Disgusted with her penny pinching approach to restaurant management and customer service, I gave in and told her to give me the bill. Before walking away she said \"well I can maybe give you a discount\" and she walked away. We paid the $60 tab for 2 people and left knowing we would never EVER go back to this establishment. On the way out we found out that Judith the \"Manager\" we were dealing with was in fact the \"Co-Owner\" of the restaurant. With owners like that the only thing keeping that place afloat is the chefs that make the \"FRESH\" food. Judith you should be ashamed of yourself! 

P.S. There is a great show on the Food Network called \"Restaurant:Steakout\" where a very successful restaurateur (that means owner Judith)  comes in to horribly mismanaged restaurants and fixes them. While doing so, he hammers in to the owners head that \"THE CUSTOMER IS KING\". Hopefully by watching this show you will learn. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after seeing it on Check Please! What a disappointment. The carne adovada was much larger on TV and was very bland. The chicken tacos was just as bland too. The rice was extremely dry as if it stayed under the hot lamp for over an hour. The food took so long to come out. The restaurant wasn't even busy for a Friday night. Save your time and money and eat Mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great to see sliders on the day time happy hour menu.  Maybe we can get the boneless wings next as they are the best in town but only available late night.  Awesome staff! Don't remember all the names but Andrew, Art, Neal, Tyler, Kristen and Krista are top notch.  Shout out to Tommy in the kitchen.  Great place, great happy hour(boneless wings please) great atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"The crushed habanero salsa paste at the Carlsbad Tavern is hotter than the chiseled abs of my athletically built Abercrombie and Fitch style imaginary boyfriend. They brought more tears to my eyes than the last time I drank a bottle of wine, alone, at home watching part two of the hunger games on Netflix. Nooooo Peeta!!! Why must you sacrifice yourself for Katniss?? She is so unworthy!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were here for the first time last night.  We are both over 45 so we are pretty experienced diners, and not some young pups. We bought a condo just a few blocks away about 6 months ago, and have had a blast trying new restaurants in the Old Town area. 

This place had a great atmosphere and we were very happy to be seated near the water fountains. Things went downhill from there. To be blunt, our waiter was just a flat out a jerk. When my girlfriend asked if there was anything on the menu that wasn't spicy, his response was rude and he acted like how dare she ask a question like that!  He said that she might as well just have a cheeseburger.  We were in a Mexican restaurant and my girlfriend was told she shouldn't have Mexican food!

We asked for chips and salsa (not free like in EVERY other Mexican restaurant BTW). When they were delivered the guy said something like \"this sauce is hot, and this sauce is hotter\".  When the waiter came back, my girlfriend asked him if they had a cheese sauce for the chips that wasn't spicy and he acted all jerky again and said \"no\". 

At that point we left and will not be back. We went a few blocks into Old Town and ate at Los Olivios and had a ball. Not as fancy, but \"normal\" Mexican food with lots of non-spicy options. Great waiter too!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered fajitas-pretty good 
My sister go chilie relleno- even better

It's kinda cool here outside seating-although river feels a little cheesy/man made/disney like-I don't really get it? 

Seemed a little pricey $15 meals-They are huge though
For 3 women we barely ate half our meal so definitely we should have split 

3 meals with 5 drinks total (3 house wines & 2 beers) was $75 plus tip 
$90 total seemed stiff to me but I live in Gilbert with 3 little kids so maybe I am bad judge of eating out pricing ??? 

They should really give out free chips & salsa-If they start doing that then I would give them 4 stars"}
{"text":"Whenever we are up around Phoenix this is our go to for authentic New Mexican food. Enchantment platter packs the heat & flavor. Their relleno's are crispy awesomeness. Service is always prompt & helpful (thanks Alex & Oscar!.) I'd give Carlsbad 5 stars but for the wimpy salsa."}
{"text":"New Mexican food?  Yes please!  Incredible food with incredible prices and an absolutely beautiful restaurant (think Pirates of the Caribbean ride and Casa Bonita from South Park).  I'm definitely coming back.  Oh...come hungry...the portions are more than generous.  

PS: try the chips and salsa.  It's not your average Picante salsa.  It was made with love, man."}
{"text":"#100...  Yes! 

I always have a great experience at the Carsbad.  Every time I've been there the food is terrific with a Southwestern flair and the service has been friendly and prompt.  It has become a favorite restaurant of my colleagues and I when we're in town.  

I've had everything from the Fillet to the Carne Adovada and they never disappoint.  Aside from the cuisine, another great attribute of the restaurant is the fact that you can sit outside on the patio and it has plenty of shade and/or heaters depending on the time of the year."}
{"text":"Not as good as we were expecting.  We are from New Mexico and are familiar with the food. Giving some latitude here, but overall as one other reviewer said it's not bad - but not good either.  Drinks are way overpriced and the mixed drink one of us had was actually undrinkable - not sure how that happens. Service is pleasant, but a little slow and we could have easily been out of there in half the time; if you go expect that.  Based on the price and quality we won't be giving this a second shot.  Bit of a disappointment.

Noting comments from the Restaurant - Thank you for responding.  Would agree that yes, the food and prep does vary from region to region; this was just very different.  We should have been more forthcoming if we felt the food was not as expected.  Be happy to stop by and try again."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch one day at work and we were all super excited to try the habanero burger.  The three of us who went all like spicy food.  While the burger itself was good, spicy would be a loose description of it.  I would come back here but I would ask for the burger to be way spicier.  We will come back I am sure but hopefully the peppers will have some more kick."}
{"text":"-Cool atmosphere

-Great Happy Hr deals (spent about $18 for 3 tall margaritas and chicken nachos two of us could not finish).
Didn't have dinner but looked at the menu and they've got green chilies everywhere so I'll be back to try them."}
{"text":"Tasty nachos. Great margs and good selection of beers. Really enjoyed the different twist on Mexican food.  Big portions."}
{"text":"After landing in Phoenix around 8pm, I yelped some places near our hotel in Scottsdale and stumbled upon this place - thanks Yelp!!

It was pretty empty by the time we got there since it was so late. And it's quite dark inside, haha. But the food was GREAT!

We ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer - YUM. Definitely get these, you won't be disappointed. We also got the Fresh Snapper Tacos (nothing special, but the fish was really really good) and the Stacked Enchiladas - SO GOOD. It was so dark in there that I didn't realize it had a fried egg on top...a really nice surprise :)

We also ordered the Flan since all the reviews said it was good. But it was just okay...too thick & rich for my liking. But overall, great place! I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great food, new Mex style..spicy.  Nice outdoor eating area. Always go there whenever I'm in Scottsdale. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"Today was my first time. My husband raves about this place. I had the carne adovada and it was delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had some very delicious pork at this establsihment. We sat outside, their patio is nice and relaxing. Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal. Friendly service, coming back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"I love the Mexican food here. The food is very spicy and well prepared. Our service was good. I like to sit inside in the dining room. You can sit in a booth and hear the conversation without having to shout at each other. We will come back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service and a beautiful atmosphere. After terrible dining on father's day weekend in Sedona, it was a great change of pace to go somewhere that actually had great food! I have to say that the gal that refills your water and clears your plate is by far the best employee! She even boxed up our leftovers! We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The atmosphere was great. Love their spicy food. Great menus something for everyone."}
{"text":"Indoors the dining area has a chill cave feel, outside has a nice little stream. Local beer on tap, the food has a strong kick so order with caution."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Carlsbad?  The food, service, and atmosphere are awesome.  Try the Carlsbad Brochettes!  I would say more, but honestly just go there and see for yourself.  Great late night menu!"}
{"text":"If you have a passion for New Mexico style hot and spicy food and you just can't seem to satiate that burning desire for those dishes that make your endorphins dance then Carlsbad Tavern is the cave for you. 

Carlsbad Tavern offers a wide variety of New Mexico style dishes that tend to leave the competition behind. People who like it HOT will love this place, those that prefer mild will find it tasty and bearable, and those with no tolerance for the heat should stay away from this kitchen. The restaurant offers a unique large patio complete with waterfalls and a small dining area with a cozy cavern like atmosphere. Beware of sitting near the pick up window during peak hours as it tends to be overly noisy and relatively chaotic."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Carlsbad Tavern. Omg. It was way beyond our expectations! The day was so cool, so we decided to sit in the patio area. It was lunch time, and there were only a few poeple on the patio, and the dining room was relatively full. There was no host at the counter/stand...so we asked the very sweet bartender if we could seet ourselves outside, she smiled and said yes. We weren't even out the door to the patio when the host walked up and appologized for not being available. We were seated, and he brought us our menus and waters, and told us the waitress would be with us shortly. It was no more than two minutes before Tia came to our table and took our drink order. She gave us a good amount of time to look over the menu and brought out the two cocktails we orderd. We put in our order and about fifteen min later we got our appetizer, these delicous kabobs of chicken and steak. The gentleman who brought them was so nice, he made sure we had plates to share the app. Our waitress Tia brought the entrees out about ten min later, my husband had the Habanero burger, and I had the fish and chips. I have to say, this was by far the best food I've eaten in a while. The entire staff here is so attentive, and made this entire lunch date with my husband so memorable. I recomend this place to anyone wanting a great time, great food, and great atmosphere. Thanks Carlsbad Tavern, best date ever!! :-)"}
{"text":"Good eats and drinks for happy hour, love the atmosphere! It's a different take on the same stuff just about every other Mex-food offered."}
{"text":"Really cool lay out. Food was good, staff was good, management was phenomenal. I forgot his name, but he was great. One of a kind layout, must experience dinner"}
{"text":"I've been here once or twice when I was younger, so obviously I can't remember what the food tasted like or my overall experience. 
Today I went for lunch with my husband and daughter and was pretty let down. 
The ambiance was fun, we sat outside next to the waterfall (it was hot, but I love the sound of water).
Our server was very nice and energetic but super slow. I don't know what his name was and it took forever to put our order in! Was it busy? No. It got pretty annoying because my 18 month old is FAR FROM patient. Oh well, she got back at slow service with the beautiful mess she left under her chair :)
None of their salads sounded good, but I'm picky with dressings. I'm sure they're great. I could have eaten burgers and fries but I'm really trying to eat healthy! SOOO I got a cup of soup and it was overpriced and wasn't \"stop the presses\" fantastic. My bad.
My husband got the \"Green Chili Philly\" and that was friggin' GREAT! I should have ignored my diet for one meal. 
My daughter had chicken fingers and fries and those were also great! (Yes, I nibbled on a few).

Lesson learned? Do NOT go here for soup :)
All in all, it was OK."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  Whenever you want really great food without the pretentious atmosphere or patrons of some other restaurants in Scottsdale, Carlsbad is the way to go.  I've loved every item I've ever tried there, especially the Green Chili burger and Carne Adovada.  Also, they have the absolute best french fries I've ever had, especially with a side of chipotle mayo.  I agree that the chips/salsa should be free, as that's standard for most mexican/new mexican restaurants, but it's not that important.  

They also have a good beer selection and always have one special seasonal selection which is always good.  The seasonal tends to be a Four Peaks offering, but I've also had Trummer Pils and Hoegaarden as well.

The service has always been great, the prices are excellent, and they're open late for when you're craving food at 1am.  I only wish that I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review after a second trip.  I brought family tonight because I'd enjoyed my last trip.  I called ahead to make reservations and specifically asked that we be in the shade.   When we arrived, we were promptly seated in the direct sun. The host quickly disappeared and it took several minutes to flag down someone who could arrange a move.  It was early and not at all crowded but the staff acted as though we were asking for their first born.  Once we were moved, we didn't see a member of the waitstaff for a loooong time.  We had all finished out water and were really hoping to order drinks and our meal. Finally our waitress showed up.  It seemed as though the wait wasn't her fault because she seemed surprised that we hadn't been waited on.    Our food and drinks were fine but I won't be back and won't recommend it again.   A real bummer. This place could be so great but the service is very poor."}
{"text":"This  New Mexican food is a blessing. Having lived in Taos I miss authentic good NM food.  One  thing to check on is the flan,  tends to be inconsistent but still delicious. This will be my new spot for comfort food and good service. So im thinking at least once a once a week meal. Yummy! So  glad I found it. Keep up the good work! A must go too.... To any NM out here they will make  it your way and yes Christmas!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. John the waiter is a champ and always recommends good grub. Lobster enchiladas and pan seared scallops"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Carlsbad Tavern at Hayden and Osborn then you must check it out.  This restaurant has fantastic ambiance and unbelievably great tasting food, the best I've had in Phoenix!!!  I spent 6 years in Southern NM and go back annually for their Green Chili during the September harvest so my standards are high.  This place does everything right.  Their outdoor patio is a true retreat from the hustle and bustle of South Scottsdale, a private retreat.  Although this place is across town, I will make it back at least monthly to get my combination plate on.  Highest praises to the Carlsbad Tavern team."}
{"text":"My sister and I very disappointed. Took about 20mins to long to get our food. 
Not sure why not that many people there.

Plus the worst cheese crisp ever!!!
The sever was MIA...finally got our check.

P.S. The free chips & salsa when check in not that great at all."}
{"text":"We came here for the late night menu. Very friendly service. Food was awesome. Drinks are the bombs!!! We will definitely come back next time we are visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place. Service was prompt and courteous. The food could be considered a little on the spicy side (for the novices) but for those with a trained palate, it was delicious. All you need to bring is your appetite. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Carlsbad Tavern since the old location on Scottsdale Road, circa 1996. I like New Mexican food and have found them to be very consistent throughout the years. 

My favorite dish is the Red River Chicken. It has a kick to it and is topped with the most amazing Cilantro Pesto, yum! All of their salads & sandwiches are great and the Green Chile Mashed Potatoes are delish. My only complaint is that the Red River Chicken isn't offered on the dinner menu, really wish they would change that!

The restaurant has a nice outdoor eating area as well as cozy booths in the bar. 

With all the traditional Mexican food in the area, it's nice to have some variety and New Mexican style at Carlsbad Tavern."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! The outside looks like a cave and is very enticing but once you step foot through the entrance...you won't believe what you see! There is a HUGE patio that is very serene and relaxing.  It litterally feels like you are on vacation. The drinks and the food are very delicious and the service is top notch.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern has an excellent alternative american cuisine menu. ¡Forget the con quesso white boy!, were talking about 1lb usda prime beef and at happy hour prices. The alternative menu also comes with a european waiter so you dont get looost in the NOCHE! Also a great place for first date. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!  We came during off hours so our waiter was super attentive and friendly.  We liked the food a lot - the lobster enchiladas were phenomenal.  My only complaint is that if you have kids that actually like Mexican food but can't handle spicy/hot food, there's not much on the menu for them.  They did have a children's menu but it was mostly cheeseburger items."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! The ambiance was super cool-- it has a cute bridge over water and a little waterfall flowing over rocks. We sat outside, at night, which I recommend, weather permitting. The service was great, our server was very friendly and did a great job accommodating our party of 11, from a 3yo to a 75yo. The food was delicious and VERY flavorful. Especially excellent options if you like some spice. There was unique/creative options  on the menu as well as classics. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and it is a must do if you visit Scottsdale, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love this place. They serve food till 2am. Are always welcoming in the late hours. Bartender is so friendly. This is my go to place for chips and salsa late at night with dos equis. Such a nice great cozy atmosphere.  A great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I enjoyed the Enchanted platter that had three different samples of other main courses on it. As someone that only likes a little bit of spice, this was PERFECT! It also comes with rice and beans and a sopapilla! Have to ask for some honey for the sopapilla... SO GOOD! The outside patio is a really nice place to sit and enjoy the company of others. We will return!"}
{"text":"Good late night menu. Two jager shots + machaca nachos loaded with hatch chili's.. wooooo! I don't usually go for spice but it's a nice, low key atmosphere late at night during the weekday. I'll come back and see what else they have to offer sans jager"}
{"text":"Ok So I have driven by this place a million times and finally stopped in for lunch, it was AWESOME I had the Lobster Sandwich, messy but awesome. I cant wait to head back. It has a cool outdoor patio, and good beers on tap. Great little place."}
{"text":"Very interesting and authentic NM food.  Lots of different places to be seated.  The Habanero burger was great and as hot and spicy as promised!  I also tried the burrito - it was good but the green chile seemed more like Bueno's (hence the 4 stars).  Will definitely be there again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is outstanding and the ambience is great. The service was prompt and friendly. The blue corn enchiladas are delicious and the Carne Asada was perfect. I go to Carlsbad frequently, and am never disappointed.  A must try whenever you are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We were in the Scottsdale area for a conference and decided to stray away from the typical conference food when we happened upon Carlsbad Tavern. 
Upon first entering, we appreciated the kitschy southwestern decor and were pretty impressed by the outdoor seating. I ordered the chicken-fried chicken, while my husband ordered the Enchantment platter. The mashed potatoes that came with my order were so, so, SO good and my husband raved about the carne adovado. 

The reason for the three stars is the slo-o-o-o-o-w service."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  Great food with a New Mexican flavor.  Great green chile, nice atmosphere, good patio and well stocked bar. The chicken wrap for lunch has great flavor, wish they offered this dish for dinner. 

They don't advertise much and learning about the restaurant is sort of by word of mouth, but once I found it I keep coming back when visiting Scottsdale.  Good value and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Had the chicken quesadilla. It was very yummy. David our waiter was very friendly and attentive of our drinks. I will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"My friend Emily and I were so excited to try this place we always drive by.  Our excitement was squashed by the rude bartender and the socially awkward couple we were sitting next to.  It's really too bad cause I thought the food was really good.  

Next time I am looking for a dark bar with a bunch of people in a bad mood, I'll hit up this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We eat here often and have yet to have a bad experience with food or service. Their Carne Adovada is outstanding and the Lobster Enchiladas are magnificent, especially the three chile sauce.  One of the things I love about this place is that they serve spicy food with a huge depth of flavor, something that is very hard to accomplish.

If you haven't been, I highly recommend checking it out. You won't be sorry, except if you have the Habenero Burger, then you might be a little sorry about half way through it...very spicy. Enjoy!  :-)"}
{"text":"Loved everything about the place food AMAZING

{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, and amazing atmosphere!  Highly recommend the green chili cheeseburger, the green chili mashed potatoes, and the crab stuffed peppers were to die for!  Will definitely be eating here A lot!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere on the patio is nice with the fountains but it isn't nice having dinner to the smell of chlorine.  The food was ok and the server had no problem honoring the yelp complimentary chips and salsa.  We each got the green chili chicken burrito.  The food was laden with cheese and not for the cholesterol conscious.  It was hard to taste much besides the cheese and the spice but, there was chicken in there too.  If it weren't for the patio/water feature, I don't think this place would be in business."}
{"text":"We're tourists & this was a great find. The service was excellent, the atmosphere fun, and Mexican food the way we like it--lots of choices & the right amount of spice. We'll be back."}
{"text":"great place to eat after a spring training game..

the outdoor patio was perfect.  the weather was warm, there is a waterfall and the candles and strung-up lights come on when the sun goes down.  great atmosphere.

the food was good!  recommend anything with the green chile sauce.  

the only thing that we didn't like was the waiter.  not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Came in a for a quick bite to get out of the heat and found myself in a great bar with a great atmosphere and the best green salsa ever. Krystal was our server and she was absolutely delightful. Try the skinny margarita and order the chips and salsa. The green salsa is homemade from tomatillos. Highly recommend any restaurant that has survived almost twenty years. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is a Scottsdale Landmark. One of the few restaurants in the area that is open until 2am every night of the weekend. Staff are super friendly and the food is very good. I recommend ordering the cheese crisp as an appetizer or even your meal!"}
{"text":"I recently came across this place that I have lived by for years but never ventured into I am so glad I did. The ambiance was great!  Friendly and casual! The newspaper menu was such a cool touch!  I had the Blue Corn enchiladas which were delicious! My server was very friendly and helpful when I was trying to decide what to eat. This place has a one of the nicest patios around. I would recommend to this place to anyone wanting to have a great meal in a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for us and is in walking distance from my boyfriend's house. Love coming here for dinner, or just drinks and appetizers.

My fave dish here is the mac & cheese. They have great chips and salsa and nachos too. You probably can't go wrong with any of their food, but I tend to stick to the same thing every time.

They have a great patio if you feel like being outdoors. Highly recommend coming here with a group of friends (guys + girls) or for a dinner date."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience.  The Bloody Mary's were watered down.
The potato hash was badly burned. One of our party had strictly Mexican food with no problem.  The rest all experienced indigestion and discomfort later. Have eaten here before a couple of years ago for lunch eating only Mexican, so maybe that's the answer.  Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Don't you love that feeling when you're starving, so you go onto Yelp and find a restaurant with raving reviews, and you get all excited. But then, you get there and actually taste the food and experience the slow service, and come to the conclusion that all those people who wrote reviews have never had good mexican food before in their lives. You can't really put the blame on them, can you? They've been deprived. 
We ordered the carne asada tacos which were very disappointing. The waffle fries/nachos were also disappointing. I must say, the blue corn tortilla enchiladas were not that bad. So if you do happen to give this place a try, I suggest you stick to the enchiladas. The good news, is the valley does have plenty of other great Mexican spots for those of you who have been deprived. So don't give up hope, just yet."}
{"text":"Excellent food! 
I love the carne adobada plate.
Great place for happy hour with an awesome patio! 
I really recommend this place if you like spicy food. Try it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Also a great hangover spot! Build your own bloody mary, order the nachos, sit by the waterfall, and nurse yourself back to health. Or go with family for dinner! Both are equally good options!"}
{"text":"Kitschy decor, annoying TVs, service was ok but disinterested.  This is a far cry from real New Mexican cuisine. Flavors are muddled and the dominant taste experience is spicy and that's it. Lots of bland, greasy cheese and no fresh herbs or fresh flavors.  Tomatillos were absent from an entree that was supposed to have them. Pozole was spicy and the hominy had no flavor."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and drinks. We were with a large group and got taken care of quickly and the server kept coming back to make sure we were taken care of. Everyone complaining it was not good \"Mexican\" food was missing the point of this place all together. I will be back and will bring my friends and family when they are in town."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the green chile cheese crisp! Absolutely delicious, and paired with a side salad it's one if my favorite meals.  The atmosphere is great, love the outdoor seating w waterfall and the copper bar top.  Service is excellent, too.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I really need to get to Carlsbad more often. Their Mexican dishes are top notch and they are not afraid of spice. Pecan grilled items steaks,ribs, fish are also always good. Great patio, dining room is cool too."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to writing a review for one of my favorite local new mexican grub spots.

I highly suggest starting with the chips and salsa and a house margarita, for an entree I HIGHLY suggest the Osso Bucco! Some of the most tender, roasted pork I have ever had! Servings are well sized, and typically come with rice and beans. 

Overall pretty good service, however every once and a while you will get a slow waiter (typically when sitting outside). 

The happy hour is descent; however I think the Margaritas should be $1 or 2 cheaper based on quality and size. 

I love the outdoor seating and when the weather is nice you can't beat a margarita and mexican food next to the waterfall.

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"At first I was little skeptical about bringing the family here but of course I was wrong! The food was delicious. I had the blue corn enchiladas with chicken and shrimp. Very good and great portion size. It was filling and the bar is unique and different which made it stand out from others. Definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  I've never had New Mexican food before, and I'm happy this is my introduction to it.  I cannot get enough of their Habanero Burger, YUM!!!!  Lobster Enchiladas and anything beef is delicious too.    Really, I think they have the best beef I've ever had.  

SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10, and it took a while for them to seat us even though the restaurant was \"empty\" in my opinion. But other than that, the food was good, the waiter was attentive, and no one had a complaint."}
{"text":"It was tough deciding what to order since everything sounded good. A couple reviews said the Enchantment Platter had four items with rice and beans: Two different enchiladas, a relleno, and a sopapilla. It was huge so I thought for sure I would have leftovers. Nope. I ate the whole thing. All were so yummy. If you \"check in\" on yelp, they give you free chips and salsa. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I wanted some type of local food and I found this place with yelp.  We came for lunch and saw the waterfall out front, it was kind of cool.  I will agree with some reviewers, that this place is dark inside.  

We ordered the carne adovada, crab stuffed pablano peppers,  lobster enchilada, and snapper tacos.  The carne adovada and crab stuffed pablano peppers were great.  The lobster enchilada was ok.  The snapper tacos was the least favorite one, I would probably not order that one again.  

Overall the food was great, and if I am ever in the Scottsdale area, I would probably come back here."}
{"text":"Always enjoy Carlsbad Tavern when I visit Scottsdale.
Great food, fantastic ambience and great staff."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the food but the management is rude.  When we went there Friday night more than half their tables were empty and we were told they had no room in a very rude voice. There were no reserved signs on the tables.  When I phoned them the following day they said they don't put a reserved sign on tables.  Perhaps instead of telling us there was no room they could have said all tables were reserved.   We have gone there a lot because the food is great and never had a problem getting a table.  We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. My wife and I were the only ones sitting outside and we never had to wait for service, food or drink refills."}
{"text":"OK...I agree with Jessica M!! This place is AWESOME!!
I have been here multiple times with different parties and it has always been a hit! 
Lunch- Green Chili Stew and Lobster crescent  sandwich.
Dinner- YOU GOTTA TRY \"Osso Bucco\" it is a Pork Shank, (Not Lamb) on top of  a mound Jalapeno mashed potatoes. Guest we were with  had the 'Rack of Lamb' which they raved about! They're served separated, pick them up by the bone and eat like a plate of appetizers. 
Last time we were there, the 'Surf and Turf' was Rib eye and Marlin- WOW, I have never had Marlin before; this was prepared seared with a light crust- unbelievable! 
OH ya.. the serve a great 'after hours' menu from 10pm until 1am!!! 
If you are in Scottsdale, you have to stop by!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate an  early Mother's Day  and wanted to try somewhere new to us!  Won't go back... Food was terrible.. Lobster enchilada and they forgot the lobster. All u could taste was corn tortilla, thick, and dry .  Meatloaf was over cooked, green chile burger was flavorless.  The nachos and  beer were the best part.  Sorry to my family for wasting your money."}
{"text":"Love this place !

Food is spicy and always cooked just right.  Menu changes every so often and have nightly specials too.  Service is great.  No matter what night you go it is busy.

it is a great little find."}
{"text":"We went here in hopes of getting some great New Mexican food, we were disappointed in their green chili sauce, the sopapilla was like flat fried dough, and it was in the shape of a perfect even sided square. All the sopapilla's we've ever had were puffy and odd round shapes. I will give them credit for great service, but would not recommend this as a place to get good authentic New Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was recently visiting from Denver when my family took me to this fine establishment for early dinner on Sunday nite.  It was 530 when we arrived there, 30 minutes before happy hour ended.  I ordered a chicken quesadilla off of the HH menu for $4, and a small dinner salad. It was BIG, and full of chicken and green chiles.  Salad was wonderful with the house jalapeno ranch dressing.  I had a great chardonnay and a great time.  Everyone elses food was also great, along with the service."}
{"text":"This place is definently not your average Scottsdale bar \ restaurant. The bar food is really good!  And the sliders are to die for!
The atmosphere is ok and they have a great patio.  The bartenders and servers were really friendly as well.  I will definently go back."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Carlsbad Tavern. My boyfriend and I are total night people so them having a late night menu is a definite plus! Liz, Jay, Darryl and Steven are all awesome people who have never let us down! The service is quick and friendly, the food is incredible! I've never had a bad meal from here! Just an overall awesome place to hang out and eat! We try to come once a month and often make it 3-4 times a month!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch one afternoon and had a tortilla crusted chicken and spinach salad. HANDS DOWN the best salad I have ever had, I did nothing short of lick the bowl. 

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!!!

I'll be back, again and again."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Good food, and good service.  We had a large group HH and our server Jay was very patient and happy to suggest plates over others.  I told him my dad was back in the US from Afghanistan and the owner came out to let me dad know all his drinks/meal were on the HOUSE! whoot whoot!! America!! F**ck yea!! Anywho- this place has a super cool patio with a walk way bridge over water.  New Mexican food is the cuisine and they give big portions and rich in flavor :-)"}
{"text":"I'm pretty let down. I brought my family here, because it seemed like a pretty fun place and had quite a few good reviews... I had decent service, but everyone's food was terrible. My sister got the veggie wrap, and couldn't eat it; everyone tried a bite, and it was just terrible. Their \"award winning\" burger was a let down, along with everything else. I got their pork shoulder dish, which was very well cooked but very poorly seasoned. I wont be going back."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house, has a cool venue and was rated pretty well on Yelp.  I REALLY wanted to like this place, I went multiple times to give it extra chances and left each time feeling like a sucker.

Bottom line is the food is bad to mediocre (There enchiladas are so nasty I couldn't finish them), the service is below average and the prices are not"}
{"text":"My first experience with the \"Bat Cave\" was an evening rendezvous with a friend of mine to watch a basketball game on TV.  It was a late night game, and to be perfectly frank, I don't remember who won - actually I don't remember much of the night at all.  It turns out that they had late night specials for food service workers, and we made the most of it.  But I do remember that it was a fun night, and after looking at the menu, I wanted to try some of their food.

One of the things that intrigued me was that most of the dishes had green chili's - either in the sauce or the actual dish.  Since I love chili's of all sorts, and had never really sampled authentic \"New Mexican\" food, I was looking forward to it.  I tried the green chili stew, the Carne Adovado and  loved them.  Since then I have tried almost all of their menu items, and haven't found one that disappoints me, although I keep coming back to the Carne Adovada.  

The service has always been great - my beer never gets empty before another is brought - a really important consideration if you are eating the habanero sauce.  As has previously been described, the decor is a little different, and the bat theme a little over the top.  But it all comes together, and is a fun place especially later in the evening.  And the food is always good."}
{"text":"Just got back from Carlsbad Tavern.  It was good.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly.  Loved their black beans.  My husband loved his fish taco salad.  I liked my meal.  I wasn't excited about my food like my husband was.  My only suggestion to them would be to add more vegetarian options without relying on cheese."}
{"text":"Never had better service. Been a local frequent patron for years - these guys have a late night menu that goes un-matched. Been frequenting this bar for 5 plus years and I've never had better service or conversation! Best local watering hole I know of south Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"carlsbad tavern  is a combination Mexican market and hole in the wall take out place which also happens to have 3 small, 2-person tables at the back. During our visit the owner's adorable 4 year old daughter was holding court at one of the tables.

We ordered some nachos and a couple of pollo burritos. The nachos were only half good- the top half. The owner/cook didn't drain one of the nacho components properly so there was a bunch of water at the bottom of the platter, rendering the bottom tortilla chips to mush.

The chicken in the  burrito was under spiced but with the addition of the salsa verde and their zippier chipotle salsa it made the spice level just fine. I also didn't understand the addition of the lettuce in the burrito. If I am not mistaken, isn't an authentic Mexican burrito just the meat and beans and/ or rice? Maybe that is an east coast rendition that I 'm not familiar with.

Overall, a decent place to pick up cheap, fresh food."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  
It's one of those places you could drive past every day for the rest of your life and never know how cool it is.  I did for years...just wondering about the name and thinking that I needed to try it.  Then, a way long time back..I took a friend there for dinner.  What a blast!  Not sure what time of year but a perfect weather to dine alfresco.  So we sat outside and the hours fairly cruised by as we ate from one end of the menu to the other.  The food was pretty good too!  Everything we tried tasted great. I think!  The drinks were good..I can swear to that.  So a few months go by and I try it again.  Second verse, same as the first!  The food was good, the service was good!

Anyhow, in the intervening years, CT has never failed me. For me, it has always been kind of a fun place to take someone who has never been there.  The outside gives no indication of how cool the interior is.  I will keep heading back and recommend it pretty highly!"}
{"text":"My mom has been a vegan for past 4 years and has slowly started incorporating meat back into her diet. It was her birthday and really wanted a green chile burger. This place had awesome reviews and overall the whole family was pretty happy. The green chile burrito was huge but very tasty and had just the right spice. $5 margaritas for happy hour were pretty tasty and service was very good! Would definitely come back here and hopefully when it isn't freezing outside will be able to sit on the gorgeous patio."}
{"text":"It isn't often enough that I get to dine at Carlsbad, but last night I decided to have dinner there. I'll be completely honest, service is always a mixed bag. But then you figure when they're crammed to the gills (which is generally how it goes), you can't always expect Speedy freaking Gonzales to be your server. However, last night I don't think I could have sneezed between the time I ordered my food and when it arrived to my table. Excellent.. is all I can say about this joint.

If you're looking for some tasty New Mexican fare, get over there!! And if it's packed, let the valet park your car(CUZ ITS FREE)! Start off with a Dos Equis Amber, get some nachos(this vegetarian WILL eat the niblets of chicken in them nachos cuz it's just that tasty) and kick back. Preferably on the patio...because there's a waterfall!!! 

And if Jacob's working the bar.. expect nothing but the best in cocktails... seriously."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the burgers.  Wait staff was great, and the outdoor seating by the waterfall is beautiful!  A must try!"}
{"text":"The food was very good but a little too spicy for my taste. The real reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars is because of the service. The waiter was very attentive, friendly and responsive which as we all know can be very lacking in some establishments."}
{"text":"Great place to go for an outside experience.  Water feature keeps you cool.  Don't expect anything more than Ok well drinks,  ok service,  ok food."}
{"text":"The fact that Carlsbad Tavern has been around so long exemplifies how forgiving people can be of a friendly neighborhood place. Large portions of mostly fried, mostly bland food, with posole and black beans added so that they can call it \"New Mexican.\" Our steak and chicken entrees were disappointingly low in flavor. Our ravenously hungry teenaged male companion gave his cheeseburger and fries two thumbs down and didn't bother to finish. Artificially colored corn chips came from a bag and were slightly stale. Avoid the guacamole--it was made of underripe avocados that had been puréed into a runny cream. Very friendly service and pleasant outdoor seating, but don't go there for the food. But if you love South Scottsdale tacky, you'll appreciate the entryway, a simulated cave entrance, and the moat circling the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food! Always excellent service.

I always get the Red River Chicken for lunch. Great with the perfect amount of spice so that my mouth starts to burn a little just when I'm about to finish.

You can't beat the chicken chimi on Tuesdays.

I've eaten there with co-workers during lunch, on date night with spouse, and even taken the entire family

Eating outside is great as long as no one is smoking and it's not too hot"}
{"text":"Met up with 2 friends from the valley who had never heard of the place. Decor had a woodsy eclectic feel. Sat down and the bartender was a pompous ass. Just had an attitude the entire time. Screwed up my drink order and was for the most part inattentive. The food was the saving grace. I had the pork whatchamacallit and it was intensely delicious. Rice and beans were also equally excellent. Come to think of it, i coulda given it a 5 star meal if it wasn't for the arrogant bartender. Oh and if you haven't read, you have to pay for the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I admit that was scared away from the habenero burger by the warnings on the menu. Fear of blindness of any length will keep me from ordering any item.  I did order a cheeseburger expecting similar love and taste to be put into this burger. Not true. Burger was dry and boring.  My wife ordered a turkey wrap with jalepeno bacon, which she loved. 

The building looks like a modern Scottsdale building outside but a cave inside. Pretty cool. Service was good."}
{"text":"I think the environment was my favorite part about this place. The decor is really unique and made it a fun experience. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. I gave it 4 stars because the food was good but not amazing."}
{"text":"I love coming to Carlsbad tavern , I work late, and they have a great late night happy hour and menu! That all being said, the MAIN reason any person in a twenty mile radius should wander into this fine establishment, is the wonderful bartender Liz. She is friendly, funny, and slings drinks like a pro! She is a true asset to the company and truly the best bartender in all of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I was sold on the reviews from fellow Yelpers that this would fulfill my need to see New Mexico-style cuisine somewhere in the vicinity of its native environment. The menu did that kitschy-kootchy faux old-time newspaper sort of look, which wasn't necessarily entirely user-friendly, but was serviceable, and the indoor water feature wasn't necessarily all that great either, but the waiter was charming, and the selections on the menu seemed interesting. The food was decent; my salmon wasn't exceptional, the salsa was a little more watery than I like, and if everything overall was not exactly as hot or as spicy as I was hoping, it wasn't bad. Basically, it's a step up from Chili's and the like, if still something short of a genuine Mexican food experience."}
{"text":"Food is really good if you like spicy. Really nice patio with attentive service. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I'm sorely disappointed considering the many good reviews of this place. Plus the fact that it is open late and so conveniently located to where we live. My family and I decided to try it out for the first time on July 4th for a late, late lunch.

THE PLACE: I love that they have a water display as you come into the restaurant. If you decide to sit by the patio area, you also get to experience the relaxing sound of water. The inside, is pretty uniquely decorated and we sat by a wall made to appear like a bat cave.

THE SERVICE: Friendly reception and our server, was super hyper and eager to assist. For sure, we never ran out of beverage. He also addressed any questions we had about the menu, as it was our first time.

THE FOOD: Oiy Vey, let's start with the good. My daughter had a simple cheeseburger. It was okay, and the fries were deliciously crispy and not oily... sadly the good ends there for us.  First, we had chips and salsa, which does not come free. The chips were nicely spiced, which would have been terrific, if they weren't stale. We can tell they were re-heated somehow as the basket it came in was warm.  But there is no masking a stale chip.  The red and green salsas in came with were pretty good though.  My hubby had the new item on the menu, Pork Tomatillo Burrito. The burrito itself was okay, the bad part was the red rice. It was so obviously old. You can taste it especially after they had to reheat and top it with cheese. The rice on my Carne Adovada Plate was just as bad.  My Carne Adovada, I had no complaints on the serving size considering price. But it just tasted off, like it has been sitting for awhile. I know it takes awhile to cook, but this just tasted old :(

Maybe it was an off day for the resto, but I'm afraid once is enough for me and don't currently plan on trying the place again."}
{"text":"We were down from the Northwest visiting family in Scottsdale. I heard about this place from a burger joint back home. Although I love Mexican food, I had to try their burgers. I love spicy food, and the habanero burger caught my eye right away. The burger was delicious, the meat was well prepared. The only thing I was disappointed about was that it was not as hot as I expected, I have tried quite a few spicy burgers in my day. The fries and salad were excellent as well. My family members had cheese crisps and quesadillas, to which there were no complaints. I did not order a beverage from the bar, but it looked very spacious with a wide selection. The restaurant also features a good sized patio setting near a pleasant moat. Service was average, nothing special but no complaints."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the patio area is great, and the service was spot on.  However, the food left a lot to be desired.  Everything seemed to be smothered by sauces, which overwhelmed everything.  Never will eat here again, but drinks?  Sure."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant . I've been going here for about 5 years and eat hear every week! I love the carne asada and I love the beans. I just finish a carna asada burrito for lunch. The carna asada is tender and not chewy. The people are very great too. Will be back next week."}
{"text":"I love sitting in the bar area when I come here, the rest of the restaurant is just way too dark. I like to see my food!

I've tried their patty melt, lobster enchiladas and blue corn enchiladas. The lobster ones are my fav, but it's very rich. Be prepared for lots o' cheese on your food!  Good chips and salsa and margaritas, fun place to unwind after a hard day at work."}
{"text":"All the requirements - good food, drinks, staff.  Love sitting outside by the running water, but it's very cozy inside as well."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem.  You owe it to yourself to give this place a try.

The Carlsbad Pasta is one of my favorite dishes in the entire city, and the Green Chile Burrito with their carne adovada is incredible.

They lose a star because you have to buy their chips and salsa.  That's the only knock I have on this place...it has become one of my favorite spots in the Valley!"}
{"text":"As a native New Mexican, I take my NEW Mexican food seriously. We moved into the area a few months ago and absolutely love going here. The name alone brought us in. This place has great food, a great happy hour, and friendly service. 

Whether you like red chile, green chile, or both, this place is good at both. Great flavor and better than average spice, especially level for the valley. 

The patio is really nice when it's cooler outside. Running water give it a cool atmosphere. Very relaxed, casual setting. We feel right at home. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood restaurant!  It's so great. The ambiance is wonderful. The patio is THE BEST! I love everything I've ever had there. Such a great spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food in the valley. Delicious and huge portions delivered by service staff that really care about their patrons. Great ambience and eclectic decor.. Happy hour is where you get to sample dishes at big discounts (drinks too). Come, you'll enjoy it I'm sure."}
{"text":"Delicious!
I just tried this place last night, and let me say the boyfriend and I were DEFINITELY impressed. I got a delicious Machaca & Tomatillo Chimi, and he got.. well I dont remember what it was actually haha. The chimichanga was amazing, and I love black beans and the rice was pretty good as well. Boyfriend thought his was spicy, which was impressive because he likes spicier things. We both thought the dishes were very flavorful. We also ordered the chips and salsa, and I am not sure what the salsas were called but the green salsa, Im assuming possibly jalapenos was SO good! It was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. Our waitress was very attentive, and very nice. So the service was good, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I made a yelp just to say how much I appreciated my visit. Let's just start this by saying hot damn! Maria. Oh Maria. Let's talk about how her attitude and smile instantly boosted my mood. Her service was fantastic and she was even running around busy. Yet, she still had the time to make sure everything was great and still had time to joke with us. The food was incredible as well, we followed all of her suggestions including that chocolate bread pudding with a shot of baileys. Game changer. My wife now pours it on her brownies at home! I just find it fantastic how this place finally found a server worth tipping and returning to see every time!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best New Mexican food in the valley!!! Highly recommend The Enchantment platter...a carne adovada burrito, chicken enchilada, and chile relleno all smothered Christmas style (both green and red chile for those of you not familiar)! Just all around consistent flavor, great drinks, and superb service! Did I mention their patio? It's a hidden gem that you can only see if you dine in. 

Fun place to go with friends for happy hour, brunch on the weekends with the family (kid-friendly too), or Taco Tuesday. Their tacos are fire, especially the filet tacos!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Everything on the menu is awesome! The boneless wings are money! They are open late night which is great for a late night snack! Full bar and great food what else could you ask for?? Try it you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Friends with benefits is an amazing scenario!!! Love my twenty-something network group!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. It was lovely. We sat outdoors. When I ordered the lobster tacos, the waitress warned me without being asked that they were \"cheesy\" with tons of cheese and you could hardly taste the lobster. That sounded unappealing, So I ordered vegetable enchiladas. However, those too were extremely cheesy. In fact each enchilada appeared to contain a glob of cheese and you could barely taste or see any of the the vegetables.I think that a little bit of cheese enhances flavoring, but too much is overwhelming and smothers the taste and natural flavors of seafood and veggies. Really, it's a lazy way to cook and totally lacking in imagination."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the service was poor. Maybe due to a large group there at the same time but even so no excuse for not taking menus off table after ordering, keeping drinks filled, asking for more drink orders or clearing plates once finished eating.  They could have sold us a lot more booze if they had just asked if we wanted anything else.
Hopefully just either new staff or not prepared for the other large group.  We really enjoyed our dishes though."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and enjoyed the lobster enchiladas; post the epic sand storm.  The food overall was flavorful and chips were served with the right sauces.  The tequila shrimp on beans appetizer was a great starter to be shared.  Great for business lunches."}
{"text":"New Mexican cuisine ...awesome food....and our waiter was right on the ball...sat outside on patio which at night is terrific...lighting ....fire places .......heaters to keep you warm...causual and relaxing.....prices on menu very affordable for all that you get....as Meg says this place is \"bomb.com\""}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite 'New Mexico' style restaurant in AZ. I typically have the carne adovado plate and it's big, slightly spicy and very good. 

My husband had the very, very spicy habanero burger. It's painfully spicy yet delicious. We will go back and get it again!"}
{"text":"In Carlsbad,If ordering breakfast DONT get the Chicken fried chicken!They will give you a plate full of gravy covered potatoes and a side of CFC.The food is terrible and service sucks."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for lunch! We go as often as we can. That smothered chimi is divine!"}
{"text":"A great find and a fun place to take out of towners for New Mexico style Mexican food. Their patio area is really nice and enjoyable for a good Margarita."}
{"text":"Took out this afternoon to try some dishes and were really impressed with everything we ordered.  Believe it or not, the pot stickers with corn sauce were amazing and the crab cakes were excellent, too.  For entrees, I had the Roswell Reuben which was really tasty (with pastrami not corned beef) and my wife had the blue corn enchiladas which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also tried the chicken fried chicken which was very, very good...so we will definitely put Carlsbad Tavern in our restaurant rotation.

Thanks again to Check Please Arizona for calling our attention to a restaurant we probably wouldn't have tried without seeing it reviewed."}
{"text":"Just jumping on the Yelp bandwagon, and figured I would start with this location! This place was truly stellar. We live in the nearby neighborhood, and decided to walk here for dinner and drinks. So glad we did! The atmosphere was awesome, the food (and portion size) was fantastic, and Liz the bartender is A+++. Definitely returning again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the nachos and the veggie enchiladas, and 2 margaritas.  The beans on the nachos were incredibly salty - could not eat without drowning them in sour cream.  The dinner plate was loaded with so much cheese you could choke from it... unhealthy and fattening meal, and unfortunately the taste, quality of food, or flavor did not justify the calories.   The atmosphere is very nice, unfortunately the food made it such that I'll never return.  Service was good overall.  The manager walked over to ask us how we were doing, but didn't stay long enough to hear the answer.  Enjoyed the 80's alternative music."}
{"text":"Not sure why, but Carlsbad seems to have fallen out of my rotation. Turns out I should put it back in. Stopped in for an early dinner on Sunday with a couple of friends. Service was good and the food was good. 

We split green chili covered nachoes to start. Very good and a bit spicy. I had the carne adovada. It was less spicy than the nachos, but still good. The black beans were off the hook good. Spicy! Rice topped with cheese was good as well.

All in all, good joint. Well worth a stop. 

CT, you are back in the rotation."}
{"text":"The Red River Chicken lunch is awesome!  It's spicy but that's the way I like it.  

The patio area is really cool!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times in the last year and each time was excellent.  I've sat outside, inside at a high top table and at the bar.  Service was great no matter where we sat.  They have a good selection of beers, bottle and tap.  But the winner here is the food.  The roast pork tenderloin was spicy and flavorful.  Good sides as well (risotto and veggies).  Dinner salad was very nice, more than just a bowl of lettuce.  House dressing was the best choice (jalapeno ranch), cream but with a bit of heat.

On a previous visit I had the seafood pasta special which had tons of seafood and a VERY spicy red sauce.  I enjoyed it, but if you want just ask and they will tone it down for you.  Customer service here was excellent.  Wait staff quite knowledgeable on the menu, willing to explain what's hot and what's not, give recommendations, and just make it an enjoyable experience for you."}
{"text":"After multiple people told me how good this place is, we finally tried it. I'm not sure what everyone is raving about.

The overall feel of the restaurant is very kitschy, which I'm not opposed to if done right, but Carlsbad's ambiance is kinda like a ride at Disney World that hasn't been updated since the early 90s.

The food was just okay. The chicken in my salad almost tasted like pressed chicken you'd find in a fast food sandwich (I'm guessing it wasn't, but the flavor wasn't much better). Overall, the food is on the spicier side, which I typically can handle, but perhaps I'm just not a green chili fan, because here...you have to be."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I are looking for a good Mexican/Southwest restaurant at which to have our rehearsal dinner.  We have many relatives coming from the East Coast as well as overseas, and want them to have a unique experience.  We saw this restaurant from the outside and thought it looked nice.  After reading reviews we decided to try it.

We were greeted by the host who told us to pick any table and he would follow us with menus.  We sat at a booth but the host was nowhere to be seen.  We waited about 10 minutes before the manager finally brought us some menus.  We considered leaving right then, but we were curious to see how long we could sit there with no menus before anyone noticed.

Anyway, we started with the chips and salsa appetizer and I got a margarita.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charged for chips and salsa.  They were not very good, but the margarita was fine.

I ordered the enchantment platter and the fiancée got the carne adovada plate.  Both were very good.

All in all, the food and margaritas are decent to good, the inside is a little tacky, and the service was subpar at best with the servers and bartenders looking like they would rather be at the DMV.  We will probably not return.  The manager who served us (did not catch his name) however was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great place to take a break on a different take on new Mexican cuisine instead of the constant sonoran style Mexican food were used to here in the valley. 

The restaurant itself has an odd decor that will have you thinking more of LOST, or Gilligan's Island instead of the famous caverns. I believe it used to be a Polynesian restaurant back in the day, many moons ago. 

The food is great here and the portions huge. They do have some Mexican beers on draft which is also great. My wife loves and swears by the Lobster enchiladas and my buddy and I spilt the Habenero burger. Thank god we split it as its by far the hottest burger this side of the Rio Grande. 

Carlsbad does a really great chili both red and green and I haven't veered to far off the menu for other entrees. 

I recommend it if your looking for great casual evening out with Friends or if your just driving by and in the mood for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Great all around from the service to the Filet Mignon Tacos to the Prickly Pear Margarita Incredibly reasonable Happy Hour!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A for atmosphere. This place has great ambiance from the moat to the dark cave-like rooms. 
However the food left a lot to be desired. We got the blue corn enchiladas and chile rellenos. Just meh. Nothing special. Plus I hate places that don't offer chips and salsa for free. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"I really like the patio here and am looking forward to sitting next to the fire this winter. I love spicy food and New Mexican food in particular and this place does not disappoint. The copper bar is pretty cool, but the patio is unique and my favorite place to sit. My only complaint is that the several times I have been here service has been fairly slow. The servers were always friendly though. Sitting at the bar things seemed to move a little faster. Overall a local favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Hands down best house margarita I've ever had! The food is amazing and reasonable. I love to dine on the patio in the winter watching the waterfall and the  fireplaces. Restaurant decor looks like a \"cavern.\" Awesome."}
{"text":"I work in the industry so sometimes by the time i'm off of work, it's a bit after 1 AM and i'm starving. I enjoy this place a lot and they have a great late night menu.

i love their fillet salad but i'm starting to venture out more. don't forget to ask for the industry discount if you work in the industry!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  Loved the chili rellenos.  Server was great.   We were celebrating my husband's 70th.  He loved the Osso Bucco.  It was Happy Hour so we had cocktails at at reduced price...Win ...Win!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok the first time that I went here I was a little confused on the concept. Mainly because I was young and dumb and had no idea that there was a Carlsbad in New Mexico (my heart & brain was sooo naive) and couldn't figure out the bats inside the restaurant (fake bats everyone, no bats were harmed while doing this review). But the first taste of the chips and salsa I didn't care where this place was, I just knew I needed this and couldn't wait for my meal. 

Fast forward 8 or so years, I still have the same excitement when I go. But now know there's a place in New Mexico with amazing the flavours, hence the hatched green chilies. The food is still just as decadent as my first time. I would lick the plate if people wouldn't judge me on that. But that's just how good this place is! My goal is to make it there for brunch and do my happy food dance when it's in front of me. 

This is such a nice and relaxing spot for fun, dates or to just sit in the bar and talk with the people around you. You can't go wrong with the food, the customer service or the ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is in my top 5 favorite places to eat in Scottsdale!!! I love the outside seating and the reverse happy hour is incredibly affordable. The food is phenomenal, we had the chicken quesadilla and the filet mignon tacos; never had anything like it!! This is all around a great place, service is always up to par and there's nothing bad on the menu (even though I haven't had every item) in my opinion this restaurant can do no wrong. I can't wait to go back, I'd eat there once a week if I lived in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday lunch. Food is good and ambiance is nice, but they could give a crap if it's your birthday. Believe me, don't need the song and dance, but when your table is clearly celebrating something, it seems like the polite thing to do to just say \"happy birthday\". 
Was a great day to sit on the patio, fountains were fountain-ing, and psrking's plentiflu/easy. 
Two of us had the Carl's Chicken Sandwich, which had a bunch of good flavors. Side salad was nicely put together and not just iceberg lettuce. The third person had the Southwest Patty Melt with fries--also very good. The tangerine margarita wasn't too bad. Prices vary between steep and reasonable. 
Will we go back? Meh..."}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst Mexican and definitely the worst New Mexican food I have ever had. I am a New Mexico native who was looking for a place to get my fix a little closer to home. I usually go to Si Señor in Chandler - it is fantastic, but a 50 minute drive for me.  

At the Carlsbad Tavern,  I tried the Enchanted Platter - a sampling of their offerings and the Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese.    
- Black Beans instead of Refried Pintos? - only in highfalutin Santa Fe
- Heavily breaded Rellenos?- yuck - not only was there too much breading (breading! not traditional light egg/flour batter) the breading just plain tasted bad
- The Green chile may have been Hatch, but just scooped out of can on top of enchiladas not  the wonderful \"Green Chile sauce\" found in NM.  
-Sopapillas were served with your dinner plate!  Right on top of the rice so they got very cold while you ate your meal.  Not at all the nice hot puffy fried dough that should come at the end of the meal (see Si Senor!)
- The only thing that was edible was the green chile macaroni and cheese- not exactly a traditional NM dish, but it was the only good tasting item we had here
- Both the Red and Green Chile were flavorless - really did a disservice to people who want to get aquainted with New Mexican Food

Bottom Line:   If you are looking for traditional Southern New Mexico cuisine, skip Carlsbad Tavern & go to Si Señor in Chandler - that's what I'm gonna do!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in the country! From the ambiance to the cuisine and service, this restaurant has a special place in my heart and stomach. The Cowboy Meatloaf was the first dish I had and it was perfect! In the sea of chain restaurants and upscale fast food, it's very relieving to find a restaurant such as this! Great food, great atmosphere and great staff!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a recommendation from a friend. The food here is ok. They use spiciness as a seasoning so all of the food is too spicy to actually taste the food. My husband really likes spicy food and thought everything was too hot as if to make up for actual seasoning and flavor. He had the pork tenderloin and thought that it was bland. (This is one of the items that didn't have peppers.) even the guacamole has to many peppers. Strangely enough the salsa are too bland. Go figure. By far the best thing on the menu is the Caramel flan. Make sure you ask for the sauce on the side. Another plus, the service was very good."}
{"text":"Great food! Great ambience! I have had a party there and work meetings and always great good and great service!  Highly recommend this restaurant when in scottsdale, AZ."}
{"text":"When I moved to S Scottsdale from Central Phoenix, I was so sad to leave Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway behind in my old hood . . .  until I discovered Carlsbad Tavern. 

I love my food with a little bite - it's comfort AND adventure on one plate. And unlike my central favorites, Carlsbad has plenty of tables ready for me to pop in on a whim. More room, yet it still feels cozy.

Outside by the waterfalls with warming heaters - great for a first date OR a night with good friends!"}
{"text":"terrible service. we had a group of 7 and the waiter refused to split the tab even though the rest of group who came a half hour later did it easily with 6. the guy also didnt like questions. unbelievably terrible and slow service.

food wasn't terrible but not good either. no idea why they call it tex mex...and suspect how this place has 4 stars . 

i really have nothing good to say, even the drinks were overpriced. $10 bad margaritas. instead of the 2 stars i wouldve given, id like to knock it down to zero for being incredibly sick the next day due to the food. dont go here, trust me."}
{"text":"I've been going to Carlsbad Tavern for years now, and it's a great go-to for late night eats (though I tried their brunch for the first time today, and was kinda blown away - I will be back for that). Food is pretty consistent, service always good, and the decor is funny/cute. 

As others have pointed out: if they say spicy on the menu, believe it."}
{"text":"I came in here with my Grandma. I had the veggie enchiladas, they were fantastic. The service however, was very slow."}
{"text":"Carlsbad is the quintessential late night date spot for south Scottsdale. The huge water feature adds a very romantic aspect to this tavern. The food is ok, but the kitchen is open til 130 which is a big plus in my book. Service is always friendly and good this would be an average restaurant if it weren't for the great service and cool ambiance!"}
{"text":"Came here during a spring training trip. Very short wait for a table. I really liked the decor. I thought it was relaxing and cool. It was a little chilly so we sat inside but the patio area was appealing as well.

Between the five people in our group, we ordered the blue corn enchiladas, green chile burrito (one with chicken, one with machaca), red snapper tacos, and green chile philly. The tacos were good tasting but the plate was kind of busy with a lot of dressings. Philly was good but the bread could have been more interesting. A little bland and dry. 

The enchiladas and burritos were great, especially the machaca and the shrimp in the enchiladas. The green chile was tasty, as was the side of red chile we asked to try. It was the best I've had in awhile, especially outside of New Mexico. The machaca meat was really tender and had a lot of flavor. Sadly, the rice and beans looked better than they tasted but we were so into the green chile we didn't really care.

Definitely a place to go for a relaxing environment and some good, New Mexican inspired food."}
{"text":"On vacation, found this place.  Great food, huge portions.   I'd return any time."}
{"text":"I had never heard of \"New Mexican\" food but now am a fan! I have been there several times and have yet to be disappointed.

Just about everything I have ordered was amazingly good - your best bet is to order something you normally would not, you can't go wrong. (I have tried the following: filet tacos, chicken quesadilla, tortilla soup and the ruben's chicken fried chicken).

The best and favorite thing I have had was their basket of sopa's - I could eat an order all to myself! 

If weather permits, I would definitely ask for a table outside or take a seat in the bar (booth preferably). The other side of the restaurant was a little dark for me."}
{"text":"What fun little place.  The staff could not have been more accommodating- they let us switch tables and locations three times, even turning off the misters outside for us.  The patio is great on a hot night- the sound of waterfalls make you feel like you are in a Mexican hacienda.  The cocktails were a bit pricey- 10$ each, but really tasty.  We had the special of the day which was 3 tostadas for 10 bucks- WOW- each of the three offered were so good!  The house specialty- pork adovada was my favorite.  The chile rellenos were excellent and the chimichanga came with a large side of rice and beans.  Excellent service- and a shout out to my friend TONY from NAPERVILLE, IL."}
{"text":"We've been to Carlsbad a number of times. The location is great and the nachos are fantastic. However, let me explain why we won't be going back:
1. The service is atrocious. We have gone in groups of 15 and as a couple and either way, the service sucks. I understand when there is a big group that service will be slower, but not bringing in 2 servers for extra large groups is just dumb. We ordered HALF the beers we could have because our server was never around! The food orders have taken 20-40 minutes! It's just insane. This is also when the restaurant does not appear busy. 
2. The manager was a jerk. He mocked my husband and insulted some of our friends.  
3. I personally would prefer to see some \"lighter\" options on the menu. There are 3 or 4 salads and that's about it. If you don't want a salad, then you better not be on a diet. 

Overall, we are disappointed with the service. I don't go out often, but when I do I expect better."}
{"text":"First stop on the long list of southwest cuisine in AZ. Solid New Mexican food. Liked the outdoor courtyard with a little pond and plenty of cacti. Definitely a kitschy, touristy vibe. 

Also a first for me was trying hatch chiles! Had them in the hatch enchiladas, and really enjoyed it. Could have been slightly spicier. 

Our waiter wasn't overly attentive, but nothing to complain about. Overall, didn't get the impression that this is an established Mexican eatery in Phoenix, but hey, it's better than most places offered in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"So disappointed have not been in years, go for special night and food is just okay , house Wine in drinkable red and white, chips stale ,salsa blab place practically empty now we know why"}
{"text":"Food was impressive.  I went here for the sopapillas and was not impressed with them.  But!!!  everything else was great.  Very flavorful.  Not too spicy, but my tastebuds needed water everyonce in a while.
Would recommend if you are looking for good New Mexican food."}
{"text":"I meant to write this review the day we were last in which was Sun.1/14/18.
We have been going to C T for years. Always great food and service.
We love to take friends and sit in the booths in the bar....great atmosphere!
1/14 was especially notable.
Our son and his fiance took us out to brunch, we decided on C T.
It was busy, but we were able to grab a table outside.
Our server was great.. he is from WI as am I.
Our drinks came, our food came out.
The food ended up being cold.
The server came back to check on us, and I mentioned some of the food was quite cool. He apologized and took some of the food back . When he came back he told us they were comping out entire bill! There was a large party seated outside at the same time, and it caused a bit of a back up . 
The team there really did go over and above we thought and we thanked them.
The food did come back completely re prepared and wonderful as always.
I can't say enough was the wonderful meal and service we had that day.
There are not a lot of places out there that would do the same.
Thanks Calrsbad Tavern!
We will be back soon I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Great food + Great Atmosphere = Great Experience

My business colleague (who grew up in Scottsdale and went to college nearby at ASU) took me to this place when I visited Scottsdale for the first time.  I asked him to take me to a place unique to Scottsdale, and he brought me here.

We sat outside on a beautiful evening.  Temperature was perfect and the restaurant had a great overall \"vibe.\"

The food was really, really good.  I had the crab stuffed chiles (i forgot the name, but you can figure it out), which were the best I've ever had.  The chiles were deep fried and had this wonderful sauce on it.  A great dish.

they also have a unique prickly pear margarita (i'm not sure if it's unique to the restaurant or unique to the area) which tastes kind of like guava.

I'll definitely be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great spot, but went there this past Sunday and it was terrible. My friends got the nachos and they were unimpressed and I got the blue corn enchiladas with rice and beans. The rice and beans were ok, but the enchiladas were over cooked, with barely any of the shrimp and chicken that were supposed to be filling them. I love spicy food, but these were so hot that it wasn't even pleasant to taste. Maybe they were trying to cover up the taste of the crappy food with more heat. I don't know, but they need to improve or they will definitely lose business."}
{"text":"The wifey and I went here last night and it was pretty good. I had some pork dish that was amazing and she had filet mignon tacos that were delicious as well. I really should have taken better note of the exact dish name I had but alas... I did not. 
Anyways, great atmosphere, friendly staff and really good food. The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is because they charge for chips and salsa and their salsa was pretty weak. By weak I mean not spicy. Come on, put some peppers in there!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood restaurant.  We live nearby and try to stop in for Happy Hour or dinner once a week.  We especially enjoy the bar area after a hot day of golf, although the patio is fun if weather permits.  It is a casual place, which suits us just fine.  My favorite dishes are the stacked enchiladas and the Osso Bucco, although I also enjoy their appetizers: quesadillas (filet or chicken) and the crab cakes.  Their dishes have a nice spicy/smoky flavor, spicier than traditional regular Mexican food.  It's an affordable and friendly place and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"great place to go with friends and unwind they have a great patio, and being in AZ that is everything (esp. if you smoke)  the menu is diverse the food is New Mexican, not mexican (being from Jersey i can not tell you what the difference is only that there is one).  portions are big, again catering to groups and making it more of a hang out then a date spot 

go green chile!"}
{"text":"Best carne adovada plate Ive had in AZ. They have a ton of spicy food selections that I love. If you are brave enough, try the habanero burger, it will light you up! They also have a great patio with a pond, waterfall and bridge to an outside bar. Cool place my family all get together for dinner"}
{"text":"Met a good friend here for lunch while I am in my ole stomping grounds of Scottsdale. This place has been around forever. I remember the old days of staggering out of the joint on a Friday night after shots of tequila and coronas. Dang that was a long time ago. Anyhow...this time I was there to eat. I ordered the steak tacos and although they were tasty they really were just average. Tasted more like a steak quesadilla than steak tacos.  The service was great though and obviously by the past reviews this place is still doing great. Enjoy! Have some tequila!"}
{"text":"The Carlsbad tavern is an interesting place! I had lobster enchiladas and they were delicious! I highly recommend them! My husband had the habanero burger & it was overbooked and a bit dry but brought the heat for sure! I was a little disappointed you have to buy chips & salsa separate & they were nothing special, skimpy on the salsas too."}
{"text":"I have only been here for late night eats and vodka drinks LOL They have great burgers and I LOVE the nachos. They have a great cherry mule as well."}
{"text":"Elizabeth is the best and we love this place.what a beautiful day out by the water fall"}
{"text":"A great late night spot when you're looking to stay out of Old Town, but not a place that I would make it a point to dine at otherwise.  For several years, \"The Bat Cave\" has been our late night stops after concerts, shows, etc. as they have a slightly abbreviated menu, but still offer many of their New Mexican dishes and drinks at a reasonable price.  The crab cakes are a great appetizer and are served on a bed of fresh greens with a very spicy habanero aioli.  My favorite entree is the green chile carne adovada burrito, of which I've also had a vegetarian version.  The carne adovada plate is good too since the meat is typically quite spicy, however, on occasion it can have some dry, leathery chunks of meat that seem like they've been severely overcooked.  In fact, there were a few times that I probably looked like a member of the Griswold family as they were trying to gnaw on the overcooked turkey at Christmas dinner (come on, everyone knows that scene!).  The enchiladas (one chicken, one shrimp) are so-so as there really isn't much spice involved and they tend to be oily and heaped with cheese.

The food always comes out quickly, but the service in general is slow as we normally have to flag down a server passing by to get another round of drinks and the bartenders seem to be moving in slow motion when making a drink or opening a bottle of beer.  The atmosphere is unique (I said unique, not upscale or even overly clean) and the outdoor patio offers a nice waterfall for scenery.  They do at least make an attempt to segregate smokers onto one side of the divided patio so there is some chance that people can enjoy the patio without shortening their lifespan, but wind direction plays a critical role here.  If you set your expectations correctly, this place has some redeeming qualities and is worth stopping in to at least try it out."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a great late night staff, atmosphere, and menu! A must go to place in Scottsdale, whether visiting or a local."}
{"text":"I took friends there one evening,when the walkway and patio was being painted.When my friend ask our server about a drink he was going to order,he had no clue and had terrible people skills.The Shrimp I ordered was off an appetizer ,brochettes.Stunk ! We stayed anyway,big mistake,2 of us ended up sick the next morning. So dissatisfied with our server also.used to love this place don't know what happened.manager got to be clueless."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED Carlsbad Tavern! We weren't sure what to expect by the name, but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. It was late in the evening and we sat on the patio, which has a really cool ambience with the fireplace, palm trees and water features. We enjoyed a few cocktails from the Late Night menu, and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered the New Mexican pot stickers. All I can say is they were amazing. The sauce was so good, I could've seriously licked the plate clean if I knew no one was watching! (Lol) The only downfall is that we found this place on the LAST night of our vacation, otherwise we would've been back at least one more time. The atmosphere, service and food here is simply outstanding. Try this place, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Connor was our waiter and he was very helpful, recommended us some good food. I got the Green Chile Cheeseburger.

Carlsbad Tavern has very nice environment, there are walls blocking the street so it feels secluded, with the waterfall running."}
{"text":"We came in here on a Monday night because there was no wait.  All the restaurants in Scottsdale were packed because of Spring Training but this gem was not.  After checking in on Yelp, we got a free order of chips and salsa!  Nice touch.  

Food: The food was good, although spicy!  We had the Stacked Enchiladas and Blue Corn Enchiladas.  They came out on a BURNING HOT plate, hotter than necessary and unsafe.  I scolded myself just nudging the plate over.  Food was good but goodness it was spicy.  

Service:  Waitress was a \"no BS\" kinda lady and I respect that!  She was in and out, checked on us, and let us enjoy our meal!  

Atmosphere:  Unfortunately, this is where the review falls short.  Although the decor is funky and dark, and the outside is gorgeous, we were disturbed many times by a completely drunken patron.  He came to our table several times, belching loudly and disgustingly as we ate.  One waitress came over and physically pulled him up from our booth one time.  He nearly sat on my to go box when he flopped down.  That really ruined the night for us.  We were actually worried to talk to the parking lot out of concern for seeing him.  The management really needs to watch the over serving and call a cab for a customer like that."}
{"text":"This place is great for ambiance food and service. The adovada is hot but wonderful and the chocolate bread pudding is amazing. Its a dark cave on the inside and waterfalls on the outside... wonderful for a date or a family gathering. Just make sure you like food a little spicy :). Would have been full 5 stars, but the price is a hair high for what you get. However, the place is always busy, so I guess it may be priced right for the area...."}
{"text":"According to my cousins in Tempe this place is a hidden gem.  They took me here even after having eaten there the night before, just because they liked it so much.  

I had the NY Carne Asada plate and it was delicious.  The meat was of pretty good grade for Carne Asada, with a very flavorful Chile-rub topped with mushroom cholula sauce on black beans and roasted corn avocado salsa.  I also had a taste of the Blue Corn Enchiladas which were also pretty tasty.

Having a sample of a few duifferent dishes we all decided that you probably can't go wrong with whatever you order.

I highly recommend this as place to come hang out, eat on the patio and have a great meal, some margaritas and maybe a few beers,"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! 
My friends and I wanted to hit the Pig and Pickle, but they were closed, so this was our alternate. So glad we discovered it!! The bartender was very attentive when taking our drink orders. He made me a wonderful Sangria just the way I wanted it! We got the carne asada fries and DAMN they were amazing!! I think we demolished them in under two minutes. We topped them with the house sauce, SO delicious. I think I will have to go back to buy a bottle! In terms of presentation and decor, I loved their patio with the huge fountain, and the interior was cozy and inviting. :D I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We only came here because The Blind Pig across the street that we wanted to go to was packed. I had friends in from out of town and we were all hungry. So we went to the next close place. Looking at the place from the outside it's built like a big dark anthill. We crossed a little bridge by an adorable outdoor patio/bar. The water and patio were clean. Walking inside we were immediately greeted by a dank smell. There are no or very few lights. There was no or very little AC and the place felt sticky. 4 in the afternoon we were only one of two families in the place. We were taken to an empty table in a big dining room. There was what appeared what once was to be a water feature/waterfall on one wall. There was no water, only a couple VERY old, VERY dusty silk plants laid around it. The walls were a dark brown black and bumpy like the inside of a cave. It felt more like an old root cellar. The table and the atmosphere were sticky. Then the waitress. Nice lady but she was wearing everyday Jean shorts and a plain black tshirt. Not very professional. She was able to take our order for 6 people without writing anything down, impressive. The drink menu was sparse. Just a couple of margaritas over ice, beer or wine. None of which sounded good so we went with the prickly pear because we hadn't had it before. Awful. Too sweet almost thick. Kind of like a thick lemonade. The food, while not expensive was severely lacking on quality. There were super hot chilies in every dish. Its almost like they were covering up for lack of taste
Obviously the food had set inder a heat lamp before coming out because the black beans had a crust and the flour tortillas were hard aeound the edges. The food wasn't terribly expensive, about $130 for all 6 of us including 4 drinks. All in all, it was like having a microwaved dinner in your Grandma's basement. It's sad, because with a little lighting and some thought to decorating it could be a neat little place."}
{"text":"They tried there best it was really late and the staff was tired. But waitress made the best experience that she can. Drinks on point but why am i paying $15 for a small margarita that's the price for a big one."}
{"text":"I love this totally unique place! All the food I have ever eaten here is the YEARS I have been coming here is always delish!
I love the fact that they have huge late night menu until 2AM every night! big nachos (my hubby's fav) and a giant ruben sandwich, yummy green chili chicken quesadillas and soups and burgers... and don't let me get started on the fries, lets just say battered fries are to die for!... you name it! YUM! Their salsas are fantastic...For dessert order the Prickly Pear Flan... so creamy! I love sitting in the bar booths, they are cozy and private feeling, yet you feel apart of the bustle. The patio is a rocking' place to sit. It has a giant waterfall that not only drowns out the street noise but gives it a totally unique and fun atmosphere! I enjoy coming here with my hubby for a casual dinner or even with a large group! Either way it is a good time!"}
{"text":"Busy place! Dark place for the most part. Lively people. My favorite menu item is the habanero burger, it comes with both fries and a salad. Really hits the spot as far as a good burger goes!"}
{"text":"The first time you eat at Carlsbad Tavern you will notice the newspaper menu titled Carlsbad Daily Guano. At lunch time I will normally eat the Crab Stuffed Poblanos which is two poblano chilies stuffed with crab meat, peppers, onions and cilantro covered in a smoked cascabell & yellow bell cream sauce.

After 4:00 PM you can order dinner entrées I recommend the Osso Bucco which is pork shank slow roasted with serranos, garlic, onion and leeks with an apple chipotle glaze. Or the Red Chile-encrusted Halibut which is baked and encrusted with red chile spices and chipotle lime beurre blanc. If you look to the top right of each entrée selection you will notice the wine pairing that is recommended for each dish.

If you like New Mexico styled food with green chiles you will love Carlsbad Tavern I think the food has the correct amount of heat and is not to spicy except for one item the Habanero Cheeseburger which comes with freshly ground habanero chilies mixed into the ground beef don't say I didn't warn you but umm good. A Habanero pepper is freaking ridiculously hot checking in at 100,00 to 300,000 Scoville units of ass kicking heat come on ice cream.

Warning this burger may cause temporary blindness or loss of hearing."}
{"text":"Pork chile stew. I'll start here.  

I was nervous at reading the description. I lived in hatch chile country once and I have never heard of potatoes, carrots or corn in my stew.  I understand the potatoes.  But it already had a roux as well. Thicken the stew.  
They dolled it up for presentation.  It still made my ears itch.  Spicy the way it should be.

Osso bucco.  

Thank you.  Lightly sprinkled with cojita cheese.  Cooked down in red chile sauce, it was absolutely delightful.  I still asked for a side of green chile.  Not because the flavor was absolutely perfect, but because I wanted to pour it over the accompanying.  Carrots.  Corn. Zucchini.  And you guessed it, mashed pots.  

I'll be back for the osso bucco.  You should go to the tavern for bucco.  But don't tell me how to eat my pork chile stew!  ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for New Mexico style food. You can't go wrong with the blue corn enchiladas, carne adovada plate, cowboy meatloaf, or a green chile cheeseburger. Actually, you can't go wrong with much of anything on the menu. Service is always fast and friendly. Oh, and don't forget to check in on Yelp and claim your free chips and salsa. Carlsbad Tavern is a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Chicken came out cold but they rectified it by warming it up.  Good selection of drinks.  Nice spacious patio."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and was not impressed. This is definitely a place with a nice atmosphere and is probably better for drinks only. Had nacho appetizer and chips and salsa. Chicken was dry and nachos had no flavor. Salsa was not spicy and very watered down. Chips were good and hot however. The food itself was OVERPRICED and just okay. Won't be back. It may be called Carlsbad tavern because its BAD. Also there is a rock for decoration inside the restaurant that says \"beware\". It should be on the outside warning people not to go in. Also their parking situation is crazy. I had to park down 2 blocks. Also I should mention it took 20 minutes for someone to come over to the table to take our drink order.

P.S.

If you wanted chicken wings, which my friend really did, you cannot get them any time. Its only for the late night menu. how hard is it to make chicken wings?? Why only LATE night?"}
{"text":"Taco's were amazing!!!! Shrimp and Carne Asada. People were friendly and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere at this restaurant. The food is good, lots of spice but a little short on flavor. Prices are a bit higher than other comparable places in the area for the food and drinks but not unreasonable. If in the area I would dine here again and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"I live about 2 minutes from this great place!  My Mom was a graduate of Carlsbad Highschool 1957 and I am from New Mexico so this has a special place in my heart!  The crab cakes are great and so is just about every single meal, especially the osso bucco.  They have a  signature ribeye quesadilla that is served early in the day.  They admit that they don't make ANY money on it. Yes, it's THAT good!  The fireplace which is outside smells great in the winter months!  There is not ONE single meal at the Tavern that is bad!!"}
{"text":"The nachos here are soooo delicious! I love nachos people. They are a little spicy, which I normally avoid since I am a wimp about spicy food, but I shoved these down like there was no tomorrow! Charming, I know. 

I was slightly drunk when I came here with my friend and fellow Yelper Matthew K., and I'd like to thank him for driving my inebriated self there. 

We sat outside on the patio, and it was pretty cool. I think. I really just can't stop thinking about those nachos, and they have obscured most of my other memories of the place...or maybe it was booze that obscured my memory.

I guess I'll just have to go back for more nachos soon!"}
{"text":"We drove by and when I saw this place I said \"I've always wanted to go to the Carlsbad Caverns.\"  So we turned in.  Which turned out great because I am also a HUGE fan of themed places.  Carlsbad Tavern does a great job of celebrating New Mexico (and themselves) with a tongue-in-cheek flair without going too far into wackiness or kitsch.   My favorite drink is a Moscow Mule and they had several variations on their happy hour cocktail menu. Happy hour runs every day--not weekdays. We had to wait a bit to get service, but once we did it was very prompt.  The food was a bit sloppily presented and there were ants crawling all over my feet (we sat outside) so that is why this isn't a five star review.  But I am most definitely looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"First .... This place looks cool....
Second .... Great service even if it was slow when i walked in
Third... Its hard to impress me with mexican food 
However it was on the pricey side... But amazing.... Let me say that again

Amazing amazing food

And i took it togo.

If u can afford more than your typical chain fast mexifood....

EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Never disappointed.  Our Burrito and enchiladas were amazing!  Our waiter Tony was super friendly"}
{"text":"I've Been coming here for 20 years!  Their patio is awesome, very soothing atmosphere with a nice waterfall.  Top Notch margaritas, excellent green Chile options, salads, burgers.  Just overall a great place!  The desserts are really fantastic, from the key lime pie to the fried ice cream and bread pudding, really no bad choices!  This has long been one of my neighborhood go to spots!"}
{"text":"5 stars because I can't wait to come back. If you enjoy great food and nice people in a non-pretentious atmosphere that brings you back to the southwest, this place belongs on your list of places to try. And if you enjoy spicy food, order the habanero burger.. Fantastic! If you don't do spicy, don't worry. The menu has something for everybody.
 
The theme here is all things New Mexico. Even the bar is made of copper with little red chili Christmas lights creating a really inviting Southwestern ambiance. The menu is paper (which is far more sanitary) and looks like a newspaper. Take the time to read it, it's hilarious!!

There is also an extremely cool outdoor area to enjoy drinks with friends & family in the beautiful AZ weather.

Ask for Krista in the bar area (bar top & booths), she'll take great care of you!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place lives up to the hype. To start,  the waitress brought us water and when we asked for lemon, she brought it on a napkin as if it were an odd request. For our meal, I ordered the Green Chili Open-Face Burger with a side salad with jalapeño ranch. I typically order ground beef well done, and this was no exception. Unfortunately, the burger I received was cooked to medium. I didn't notice at first because we were seated on the dark patio, and the string lights above us were burnt out, so we couldn't see our food. It was evening, and another waiter went around to light the candles on the tables, but I guess he forgot ours. Our waitress was unattentive, and my husband had to ask the food runner for water. When the waitress did finally acknowledge us, she apologized for not getting us more water, and then told me that my burger was probably undercooked because the stove doesn't work well. Good to know. Anyway, I'm just not sure I want to return. I came here a few years back, and the waiter forgot to put in my order until all the other people in my party were served. Unfortunately, the service here needs improvement, and though I like the food (for the most part), the service is bad enough for me to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great cavern themed atmosphere. I especially enjoy eating on the patio when good weather allows. The food here is fantastic and they have large portions. I love the potsticker appetizer, shrimp enchiladas, and prickly pear margarita."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place.  It's not really well marked on Hayden and I almost missed it the last time I was driving there.  The first few times I was here there were always long waits, but I was here last on a Saturday night at about 730 and it was probably half empty...hopefully they aren't losing too much business.

My favorite things here are the lobster enchiladas and the crab stuffed poblano peppers. The lobster enchilada plate comes with two enchiladas, rice pilaf and asparagus.  It's topped with a really nice mild spiced, lobster-y, tomato-y, creamy sauce.  I recommend saving a little rice until the end so you can easily clean up all the extra sauce.  The enchiladas are not too big, but you're definitely full after finishing them.  The poblanos are awesome.  I'm pretty sure they're broiled and there's a great crisp on top of the peppers.  It's a pretty rich dish and somewhat spicy, but the sweetness of the peppers brings everything together well.  

The appetizers are good.  Last time I was there I had the nachos and mexican potstickers.  The nachos were awesome...chips were crunchy, plenty of cheese, and they came with green chiles on top, which gave it a great lil kick.  The potsitckers were not anything special, but kinda an interesting idea with the asian/mexican mix. 

Finally, a trip to Carlsbad Tavern is not complete without the sopapillas.  They serve them warm with honey.  No matter how full you are, there is always room for a sopapilla or two."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both experiences were nice as I was able to sit inside by the bar once and outside at twilight my second visit. The service was prompt and food was tasty. I lot of people think Mexican right away but this is more of a New Mexico built menu, hence the recipes use a lot of green chili. Drinks are always nice if you choose to partake. I recommend any of their margaritas--always yummy! I would not recommend Carlsbad to to large parties as their space wouldn't accompany such a group."}
{"text":"Great \"Oasis\" spot.  You'll see this place on the east side of the road. You sort of enter the \"bat cave\" over a bridge and pull though the restaurant before you're seated outside.

It's all walled off and the fresh \"naturey batty\" vibe is refreshing with no view of the bustling street outside.

The food is hot, and spicy and really good.  Great service.  Solid spot for great lunching and I'm sure dinnering."}
{"text":"Meh...Blah...Robin, don't ever take me to the bat cave again!

This was the worst New Mexican food and margaritas we ever had! I never have to force myself to drink anything with tequila in it, but their house margarita just didn't taste right. We got chips and salsa, which you have to pay for, and was told which salsa was mild and which was hot. They must have forgotten the chiles as neither was hot. 

We then asked our waiter about some items on the menu and his response was \"it's popular\". We then asked what he would recommend and he said \"anything with sauce and cheese on it to cover it up\". Wow...we looked at each other thinking \"is the food so nasty that we need cheese and sauce to get through it?\" We decided to split the Blue Corn Enchiladas and the 1/2 Rotisserie Spicy Citrus Chicken. I don't know how to explain it but the enchiladas were tough and the green chile was tasteless. The chicken sounded like it should be spicy with habanero and guajillo chiles. It tasted more like it was smothered in BBQ sauce. It came with green chile mac n' cheese which was tasteless and the jicama slaw, well the jicama was okay but the cabbage was bitter and the dressing did not help it at all. 

The only reason I gave it 1 star is for the cool atmosphere! Inside it's like a bat cave and the outside patio in nice weather looks relaxing. 

Unless we hear some significant changes to the food and drink, I think we'll have to hang out with Superman instead!"}
{"text":"I love this place.... needs a little upgrade outside  but fun everywhere else.... I swear every time I come here i try something different to eat and drink.... but I always forget to check in.... I enjoy the Fillet tacos.. I get them with no cheese... they put alot....Mini Burgers are always spot on. . Chips and salsa don't have alot of flavor.. Prickly pear Margarita is the fall back when beer is outta the question. Tortilla soup is a no-go late night snack... It's never as good as in the day. Awesome happy hour and OPEN TILL 2AM... WITH FOOD. Really cool servers and bartenders. Come here if you need a BIG bat cave to hide in for a cool down."}
{"text":"A mixed bag of great and average. When the weather is nice, their outside patio is a fantastic hideaway to grab a bite or a drink. Their margaritas are tasty and go well with the spicy food. And, most importantly here, they know how to use those hatch chilis.

On the down side the staff always seems to require flagging down, especially right before Happy Hour ends. Would have been nice to get in one last order beforehand, but couldn't find anyone. Had the carne adovada, one of my favorite dishes, and it was a mix of tender and spicy with burnt and unchewable. Seriously, I spit out one whole chunk of meat I couldn't chew through after several minutes. There was enough good meat in there that I was full by the end (though the chips and salsa helped), but I should never have to eat around bad bits to get to the good.

My wife had the chile rellenos, and they were spicy and tasty. Might be a better bet to go with if you try the place out."}
{"text":"Good that it is open late, but just a small downgrade on food. The chicken potstickers looked flat and tasted very different from our last visit. The corn cream sauce was lukewarm at best and there wasn't enough of it anyway. The sliders were good, but supposedly the bacon and onions is cooked into the meat, but I couldn't detect much. Might try again with different food."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Carlsbad Tavern. I am not sure why someone would believe this is Mexican food, far from it. They serve south western style cuisine and do a great job with it. 
I have no complaints of the service, this is a casual dining environment where locals and others come to relax and have a good hearty meal.
When you arrive put away the expectations and just enjoy the bat cave. If you do have something to complain about take it to managment, they will take care of you."}
{"text":"If you like extremely spicy, this is your place. The food was awesome and service was spectacular as well!."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome New Mexican food. If you like spice, they have it. If you want something beyond the traditional enchilada or burrito, they got it. This place has one of the most unique and romantic patios in the valley, with a waterfall and faux cave. If you are looking for an affordable date place or just a unique dinner out, this is it."}
{"text":"great place..  food is good.. please change your salsa.. but love the chips..  staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"I tried their green chile chicken quesadilla and their burger and I must say it was amazing! The meat they use on that burger is delish! I was also surprised with the portion of the quesadilla! It was very filling and I couldn't finish it! The lagoon in the front is also really cool! Overall, everything was good. Great staff and I even got to meet the owner and he was very kind! Got to hear more about the background of this restaurant and it was very interesting! Do yourself a favor and make sure to try their food!"}
{"text":"What a Great Surprise!: At the suggestion of some friends, we met them at Carlsbad Tavern for dinner and drinks. I had driven by the place hundreds of times, but never thought much of it. I was quite surprised by the nice atmosphere (including a \"moat\") and wonderful food. I will definitely be back.

P.S. When they warn you the habanero burger is hot, heed their warning!!!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended from a friend of mine.  I thought it was okay.  

The ambiance and menu looked much better than the food was.  

The nachos were pretty plain.  I was hoping for more heat and that great New Mexico chile flavor.  The carne adovada plate was also a bit on the boring side.  I have had carne adovada all over the place and this one didn't stand out.  When I think of New Mexican food I think green chiles, red chile, lots of spice and savoriness.  

The patio was nice and the service met expectations for a busy place.

While it wasn't bad I really don't think I would come back as it is a bit far for me and was just okay.  I also can't say I would recommend it as for New Mexican food there are just better options around the valley."}
{"text":"An incredible place.  The food is wonderful, flavorful but not excessively spicy.  This is the cooking of New Mexico.

I was visiting and out hosts took us there.

A definite DON'T MISS!"}
{"text":"Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking. 

My friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it. 

Guac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though. 

For lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it. 

Throughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were \"free\" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.  

So buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for dinner with my boyfriend because of good Yelp reviews, and because the Southwest Airlines Dining program offers miles for eating here. Unfortunately, the food just didn't measure up.

Let me first start by saying that I like southwestern food. My family lives in New Mexico, so I know what New Mexican food is supposed to taste like.

To start, we ordered drinks. Then I checked-in on Yelp, and got the free chips and salsa. All of which was fine.

I ordered the cheese enchiladas. I got the enchiladas. I attempted to eat the enchiladas, but as you can see from the video I posted, the enchiladas were more like a soggy cheese crisp that a child would cook in a microwave. 

The enchiladas were not even rolled. The blue corn tortillas were flat and soggy, but the outside of the tortilla seemed slightly burnt. Then the cheese grease made it completely unpalatable. 

So I didn't eat the \"enchiladas\" and just ate the beans and rice which filled me up anyway. So when the waitress finally came back over and asked how everything was, I told her that I was not happy with the enchiladas, and I explained what I explained above. She asked if I wanted something else, I said no since I was full and didn't want to wait for something else. So she said I'm sorry \"it wasn't what you expected\" and walked away.

Some time later, a random guy comes up to our table and asks us how everything is, I say fine and he moved on to asking the other tables around us how their food was. My boyfriend pointed out that he was probably the manager, and that I should say something. I turned around to see if we could grab his attention, but he was already gone.

A while later, the waitress comes back over and asks if we need anything. I ask for the check. She goes and gets the check and puts it on the table. I put my card in, she brings back the check and says I'm sorry the food wasn't what you expected, but I hope you give us another chance in the future. And I said that unfortunately we would not be back based on the quality of the food.

On our way out, the guy that had stopped by our table (whom we assume is the manager), was standing at the host stand. I went up and said that I wanted to share our feedback because I don't think the waitress fully understood. I proceeded to explain what I wrote above about the enchiladas basically being a microwaved cheese quesadilla. The guy then proceeds to say that he was sorry that the food didn't taste like what I expected, and that they are a New Mexican restaurant which is not like Mexican food. 

So I said, I completely understand that. In fact my family is from New Mexico, so I know southwestern food very well. And that the problem with the meal wasn't that I expected authentic Mexican food, and instead was given New Mexican food...the problem was that the food was poorly made. 

He then proceeded to tell me that I should have mentioned something at the table when he stopped by. I told him that I didn't know he was the manager (as he was no more dressed up than the other employee or customer). I walked out after that, because clearly there was nothing that I could have said to get him to understand. 

I would not recommend the Carlsbad Tavern restaurant."}
{"text":"Carlsbad is the perfect mix of authentic Mexican and New Mexican flavors. Any garnish is rarely touched.  The many styles of margaritas are the perfect touch to a meal of great comfort. The refreshing ambiance and remarkable service make Carlsbad a \"go-to\" for any celebration or night out on the town.  Tonight, we were taken care of by Stephanie and look forward to visiting her again."}
{"text":"THIS is the place to go if you like extra spicy Mexican food.   Mind you, they have great food choices if you prefer milder options, but spicy is their specialty.  Great outdoor and indoor seating and fast and friendly service, even when they are busy.  Try the habanero burger."}
{"text":"Environment is where this establishment thrives.  They afford several demographics to assimilate and enjoy an experience.  This place's food is pricey, yet the staff makes a great evening.  The evenings Darryl is in charge, the place is copasetic.  It allows the local drinkers to enjoy the bar, whilst the upscale crowd will love the lagoon-esque patio.  A wonderful backdrop and retreat in Old-Town."}
{"text":"Alawys l;ove this place only had one bad meal, the pork relleno had bery tough pork on the inside.  I mentioned it to the manager and she agreed.  I hope they fixed it.  I now go to Richardsons for the pork relleno.  Other dishes at carsbad are excellent"}
{"text":"To the BAT CAVE!. We have our company's parties here and take potential clients from out of town to kick things up a notch. Great atmosphere and the food is really tasty. They use Pecan wood in their grill which makes a big difference. Start off with some grilled Tequila Shrimp and some grilled Carlsbad Brochettes. A few of my favorites are the Machacha and Tomatillo Chimichanga, the Carne Adovada Plate, and the very spicy Habanero Burger. Menu reads \"Warning Hot! ... may cause temporary blindness or loss of hearing\". I thoroughly enjoyed it and was sweating like a dog. More napkins please. They have a large amount of choices on the menu including their NM spin on the Reuben Sandwich, the Philly Cheese Steak, and the Chicken Sandwich. Don't forget some desert to cool things down a bit. Carmel Flan covered with Prickly Pear or Chocolate Grand Marnier sauce or the decadent Chocolate Bread Pudding covered with Butterscotch sauce. Touchdown for the team!"}
{"text":"Good for kids!!  I am giving the restaurant 5 stars because of the ambiance.  The interior is part like a cave and part bar, both sides with fake bats spread around.  Words can do it justice.
The outside has a waterfall, with a small river/moat around part of the restaurant.  There are Bat drawings all over the outside.
The service was A+!  I always had a cold beer and we had a large group of 9 adults with 2 toddlers.  We did call ahead to let them know and we showed up 30 minutes early and no problem.  
The food was okay, but really I would tell anyone to go for the experience.
Free valet parking!  But I would remind people to still tip the guy parking your car."}
{"text":"Great service for our group of 7.  Delicious food.  The patio is a fun place to sit at 7pm. I'm sure it's scorching hot earlier in the day. 

I don't generally like shrimp tacos, but they have AMAZING shrimp tacos. Chips and Salsa are great!  Carne Avodaba (sp?) was great!"}
{"text":"The offer of free chips and salsa should not be what brings you here...aren't they usually free anyway?! Carlsbad Tavern should focus their attention on the quality of the food rather than the quantity. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious. Went for green Chile rellenos, absolutely awesome. Dining companions enjoyed the veggie enchiladas and ... a burrito made with a spicy meat starts with an A.. everything was yummy and actually spicy (pleasant after leaving TX for UT...) service good. Relatively quiet, comfortable booth."}
{"text":"I wish I would have received half of this amount of concern from the manger that I DID share mg concerns with immediately after eating. The manager was not concerned in the least that we were u happy and do find it interesting that you know exactly who we are out of ALL of the parties of 6 you had  at this time. The fact the manager laughed at me when I called to make our original reservation, the fact that NO honey came with our soapailla and my friend paid $6.00 for 3 tablespoons of guac were left off of the original review. No hurt feelings- we won't be back and I will continue to let everyone I know how horrible this place, especially the manager was."}
{"text":"This place is fine--I can't say I have very strong feelings about it either way.

The cave ambiance is definitely unique but it's a bit strange. There were also a LOT of kids in the restaurant, so it's a good place to go with a family. Margaritas were weak and watered down. Food was okay, but not nearly as good as other New Mexican spots like Blue Adobe or Dick's Hideaway. I had the Green Chile burrito and it was good but not amazing. 

Watered down New Mexican food, if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Delicious New Mexico cuisine and excellent service from Natalie! Outdoor seating is plentiful and lovely with relaxing fountains in the background. We will be back!"}
{"text":"What an oasis in Scottsdale. Even though this restaurant is on a main road, sitting on the patio you would have no idea. The multi level patio has a waterfall and is tastefully tacky. 

The margs were good. And if you check in you get free chips and salsa! The salsas look very homemade and the salsa verde was very very good. 

We got a restaurant week special and an extra entree and both waddled home with a lot of left overs. 

The enchantment platter was perfect for someone who can't decide on just one thing. The lobster enchiladas had great big pieces of lobster in them.

The prickly pear flan had a great consistency and was not too sweet!"}
{"text":"Loved the food!  We are from Albuquerque, and we were looking something sort of similar to Sadie's in Albuquerque.  It's a little different, but it was excellent.  The green chili wasn't too spicy, it is the season for green chilies, therefore they were perfect.   Our server, Paul, was awesome. We will definitely be back! Oh, and by the way, we ordered the Enchantment Platter."}
{"text":"I took a group of out-of-towners (from London, specifically) here as I thought it would be the perfect blend of Southwest style without the cheese and all of the kitsch. And I have to admit, it was less pastel-pink-stucco-and-bleached-cow-skulls and more twisted-Old-West-mining-camp. You'd be more likely to spot a chupacabra lurking in the shadows here than a mint green gecko stenciled on the wall. So score on that one Carlsbad.

I was mildly disappointed in the patio area - but my expectations were probably too high to begin with. Like when everyone and their mom raves about how amazing Avatar was, then you finally see it and go, yeah, I mean it was cool or whatever. 

The food was pretty good, and the blend of familiar (burgers) with New Mexican/Mexican variety. Makes it hard to find a diner who couldn't find something to eat here. After dinner, some of the party headed home and a small group of us moved to the bar area to have a couple more drinks and chat it up in a more lively atmosphere. Also a score for that change up in vibe.

The one major complaint I have to share is that the server ran one card for the entire bill (we had two cards and the rest cash, with it clearly marked which card should be run for which amount) accidentally, before charging the card correctly. That wouldn't have been so bad, but he didn't bother to mention it, so my poor friend had quite the surprise when she checked her bank account to see that it was about $290 less than it should have been. I think it took about 3 business days to get that money back, and that's a long time to wait for almost $300 of your own money to get back to you. I'm sure it's a fluke and I doubt it's a common occurrence here, but sure was a bummer and not exactly handled professionally.

If I come back, it would probably only be for day drinking and snacks or happy hour, or if I had more out of towners to entertain. I wasn't impressed enough to make my way out there for a regular dinner."}
{"text":"\"Surprisingly good\" as one Reviewer wrote! So true! Odd looking place when you first walk in. Menu is odd too and looks like a newspaper. But odd in a good way.  All I can say is....the rellenos are so so sinful! 

Goce!"}
{"text":"Brunch on Saturday was spectacular. $5.00 Bloodies. Spectacular. Ambiance, bar, patio menu food was all spectacular. Really want to come back, but we have to wait for a rainy day. WHY you ask?
Cause patio not dog friendly. On nice days we like to bring Lucy with. So Sunday we went to Chelsea's Kitchen and Monday we went to Wallys gastropub, both dog friendly eateries listed on Bring Fido.com."}
{"text":"Guacamole was delicious!!!!' we went for happy hour and had chicken quesadillas, filet tacos, and Carlsbad brochettes! They were all delicious only down fall I found a hair  :/ kind of gross"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places I have ever been to. It's like entering a cave, or cavern. The menu has lots of New Mexico inspired dishes. I went for happy hour. The drinks were great! I had some happy hour appetizers including the potstickers and they were devine. They had a wonderful sauce to dip them in. I also had a shredded chicken quesadilla. It was packed with chicken and cheese. The service was great and the food was too! This is a cool spot to hang out."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! First, its theme is the Carlsbad Caverns so New Mexican food, bat art hanging everywhere, a waterfall, and bridge. Service was excellent, our waiter was Nick and he was very patient and kind.

We came at midnight on a Saturday night and ate from their Reverse Happy Hour Menu which is from 10:00pm to 2:00am. We ordered the New Mexican Potstickers which were amazing! I highly recommend them. They were chicken and Anaheim Chiles with a sweet corn cream sauce. We also ordered the Lobster Bites which were huge fried balls stuffed with Green Chile macaroni and cheese, and lobster. These were okay, wish they had added more lobster, I barely tasted it.

The setting and ambiance is just gorgeous. Excellent outdoor lighting, great firepits, wonderful sounds and views by the waterfall, and just a perfect place to have a drink, snack, or dinner with family, friends, or a date. I'm definitely coming back soon.

I did ask about the bat art and where they got it from. I wanted to order some from the artist or company they got it from for my own home, like the hanging bats near the bar, and the metal bats outside, but no one seemed to know. They mentioned the owner would have known but he wasn't in at the moment."}
{"text":"Very good, spicy New Mexican cuisine. Being from Albuquerque, it's hard to find true NM food, here in Arizona. 

My husband had the enchantment platter, which he really enjoyed. I had a salad and green chile soup. Very good. My kids had the 3 tacos on the appetizer menu, but the steak was seasoned to be quite spicy for them so they didn't eat it. When I brought this up to the waitress, she didn't seem too concerned and charged us the $14 anyway. That was my only gripe. Our bill was $60 after having beer with our meal."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a great find, good service, great food. The downside....when we went there was no water in the outdoor \"river\" and there was a long wait on a Friday night- so we sat in the bar. But i guess that's a good sign..."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or dinner.  The ambience is especially noteworthy with a waterfall, outdoors seating, indoor seating, and a bar.  The menu is New Mexican cuisine plus burgers and other specials like fish or steak."}
{"text":"Had the pork shank osso bucco.  Could have been more spivey but super flavorful and the green chili mashed potatoes were great plus a generous helping veges so the meal wasn't too heavy. Got to taste the green chili sauce and it wasn't to my liking for NM food. Red sauce was pretty good.  Service from the bartender (ate at the bar) was outstanding.  See why it made Scottsdale top 10."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant after nearly a year since trying it last.  But I think my expectations exceeded the results.  I tried the Taos Pork Tenderloin and was disappointed because the pork was cut into medallions, which I believe is the reason they were dry.  Frankly, I was happier with the side items: my mixed vegetables were good and cooked to perfection and the Jalapeno potatoes are awesome but apportioned too small.

My dinner companion had the Carlsbad Ribeye with which he was very happy.  I guess it was me who thought that the meal should be more balanced than this huge piece of meat (20 ounces) served with a tortilla smaller than my hand.

I remember the first time I visited, thinking that the waterfalls were an unusual touch, but the more I sat there, the more I found myself thinking of Gilligan's Island.  A little too corny for me, I guess.

Our service was great though; both the host and the server were really friendly."}
{"text":"We decided to take a road trip to Phoenix and found Carlsbad Tavern on Yelp and saw how many reviews it had and decided to try it out. Good Food Great Atmosphere. We will defiantly stop by again when Im back in town."}
{"text":"My first time here and my last. 
No chips and salsa. Strike 1...
Didn't check Yelp beforehand and now know I should have. Paid $5 and that's excessive and inexcusable. They should be FREE
I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it came with no condiments. No guac, no sour cream, no pico. Strike 2
I get that this is southwest but why does the kitchen have all of those items but customer must pay extra for any of them? Well, I paid for all 3
Quesadilla was MEH. STRIKE 3
OUT!!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Scottsdale and this is the one place I really miss.  The ambience is nifty and the food is delicious.  I always ordered the green chili burrito and couldn't even begin to finish it, but it made for a tasty meal the next day.  The drinks are also really good.  This is a definite jewel in this town--don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and picks from the menu. I tried the habanero sliders which really delivered the heat and flavor. I thought they were awesome but be warned they are not for the spice weary crowd. Great atmosphere and location. Crazy bartender with his pours!"}
{"text":"Ill make this one short - Green Chile Mac & Cheese !!  Oh yeah and service is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Went there later one of the weekend nights. The ambiance seems good for friends get together or even family eating. I ordered the Chile Releno stuffed with pork since this place seems to specialize in green chile. And let me say it was amazingly good. I am hooked! A friend ordered the pork shank. It was a bit strange since it's more Italian than new mexican the way it was made. But, it's still tender and yummy. I'll definitely have to go back and try some more things on the menu. But I like!"}
{"text":"Food was uninspired. Meatloaf came as recommended. While unique it was not something that I would try again. Chips came with two types of salsa neither had unique flavors or were especially good. The ambience and potential was there but the food did not deliver. Unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Arriving in AZ, we and our friends headed to Carlsbad Tavern to have lunch with our daughter who lives in Mesa.  What a great choice to start the trip. The tavern is very cool with lots of Southwest/AZ hip decor. We were seated promptly outside on the patio right beside the beautiful water feature.  It was cool and comfortable. Our server was prompt and courteous.  Food and drinks were spot on.  We had a totally relaxing and enjoyable time at this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Love it. Good food. Good service. I suggest sitting outside if the weather permits. All around a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I think the prices are a little high but the outside patio is fantastic. I think happy hour here is good, but it only goes until 6 pm. I've had a good number of things off their menu:

- Tacos: Three tacos for $14 is a little too pricey to me for what they are, but the same dish for $7 at HH is spot on. The black beans are incredibly tasty (lots of spices and vegetarian), and the tacos are traditionally what you would expect. They subbed in vegetarian mexican rice for the meat for me, which was great. Love the guacamole on them, but otherwise standard ingredients for tex mex.
- Chips, salsa, & guacamole: Good but I hate paying for chips & salsa at a mexican food place, especially one whose prices should afford a free basket. The guacamole is delicious. The salsas are pretty good, nothing to write home about but good all the same.
- Nachos: My friends love this dish, it's giant and enough to feed two. Unfortunately there aren't much of toppings on it besides the meat, beans, & cheese.
- French fries: These are AMAZING! You get a heaping amount with a burger and they are perfection. Soft on the inside, beer battered or otherwise some kind of crust crusty on the outside, and perfectly seasoned. I'm pretty sure I'd be happy to make a meal out of their french fries, guacamole, and beer. 

So I recommend it for an outdoor happy hour if you can manage to get there early enough to enjoy it, otherwise there are a lot of good places at the same or less price in Old Town."}
{"text":"Me and my husband tried tavern for the first time. Jen was our server and she was awesome!  We had a great experience! The tacos were amazing. Their happy hour was great as well. We will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Too bad Yelp doesn't permit a minus star review- 
Even if the food were free I wouldn't go back. The ambiance is of an old folks home; dusty, cluttered and outdated.
The food is not appetizing and lacks flavor. The service was inattentive."}
{"text":"The one (and only) thing I miss about living in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the food. \"New Mexico Mexican\" is different, and not easily found outside the confines of that state.

Carlsbad Tavern gets it though. They offer truly authentic New Mexican cuisine. Some will love it, some won't. 

On top of good food, the atmosphere is cool too. Even on a freezing cold night (freezing from the Phoenix perspective), you can sit comfortably on the wicked cool patio thanks to fireplaces and heaters. 

Service has been above average on every trip I've taken."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and ambiance! It is in a beautiful part of Scottsdale. The staff were friendly. Definitely coming back! Oh drinks were wonderful too. I especially love the lighting and water"}
{"text":"I came here for the happy hour once and was very pleased with how everything was. Looking over the happy hour menu we decided on the chicken quesadilla and the New Mexican pot stickers with green salsa. The green salsa is definitely a must try as it's quite different than what I'm used to. I can definitely see the pot stickers being very popular after trying it.

It was nice to be able to sit outside and I loved the atmosphere. It's a great place to gather with friends and family. The service here is great and they make sure that you have a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I like you Carlsbad Tavern, I really do. We are friends, right? Sooo, I can totally come back even though I was introduced to you while on a date with a guy who I'm not dating anymore because he has a little problem called a girlfriend? That wouldn't be awkward, right?  

Yeah, you should bring dates here if you're hiding something from them because they will be distracted by the waterfall. Also, the enchiladas are decent (let's face it, I'll eat anything covered in green chili) and the patio is great for relaxing with a margarita. Carlsbad isn't good enough for you to get lucky though, just in case you were wondering about that."}
{"text":"Great find! This place has a lovely outdoor seating area by a fountain that turns into a little stream you can dine next to. Outdoor bar and outdoor tvs. The servers were friendly, the food was out fast, and the quality was great."}
{"text":"Best New Mexican food in town! Service was great and so were the stacked enchiladas! Will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Finally! After trying about 10 different places looking for good, spicy Mexican style food near north Chandler, we found our new favorite place. Have come her during regular and late night dining hours and have not been disappointed yet. Great atmosphere, especially on the patio during cooler days because the waterfall and cavern like area around the patio makes you feel like you're really in a cavern. Staff was great at keeping the table well stocked with water, gave helpful recommendations for dinner, and is always friendly.

As for the food, the food is fantastic. At a gance, the menu seems a little pricy but you find out why when the food comes around. Have used the free chips and salsa check-in offer every time. The salsa isn't very spicy but is very flavorful. Doesn't look or taste pre-made and tastes great. The seasoned chips that come with it were good too. Just have to be careful not to fill up before the main pate comes your way because the dinner plates are huge! First time I came I had the Enchantment Platter and second time I got the Carne Adovada Burrito from their late night menu. will say this for the spice levels on the menu: they aren't messing around. Very accurate when it comes to heat intensity so if you like it hot this is a good place to go. 

The Enchantment Platter has a little bit of everything: chilli relleno, chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito with red and Hatch green chilli sauce, rice, black beans, and a sopapilla. I hope you didn't think I was joking about the size of these plates. FRIGGIN HUGE!!! You definitely get what you pay for in spades. Very good chilli relleno. Crispy with good filling. I can't stand eggy/soggy rellenos that most restaurants have so was very happy.  The chicken enchilada was very flavorful with a good kick back from the chili sauce. chicken inside was moist with good seasoning. The carne adovada burrito was great. Again, good spice and seasoning for the beef and not dry at all. The red chilli on the burrito had a good flavor but wasn't too spicy. Not complaining though because the bee inside had enough kick for me without the sauce adding to it. Also, spiced black beans? Nom! Rice is what it is, not that I go out to eat for the sides. The Sopaipilla was nice and flaky. Good to help soak up the chili sauce. Waste not want not! Ended up taking half of this plate home for a very tasty lunch.

The late night Carne Avodada burrito is the same as the one that came on the Enchantment platter, just bigger since it's on it's own. Came with black beans and rice. Also had to try the Sopaipillas for desert. Again, very flaky and warm with a good dash of powdered sugar on them. Served with honey of course.

Have got to say, this is by far one of the best Mexican style restaurants I've been to to date. Will definitely be coming here when I need my spice fix! Great place to bring your friends for the atmosphere or if you wanna watch them burn up from the heat for a laugh! XD"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the décor. It's incredible with flowing water and festive lights everywhere. I would have loved to sit outside but members of our party voted against it. 

Other than that I wasn't impressed. Everything was spicy. Everything! The beans and rice that accompanied most meals. The pico de gallo was on fire. The guacamole needed a fire extinguisher. The only thing on the menu that wasn't spicy was the cheeseburger. I wish someone would have told me this before we sat down.  

Our service also left much to be desired. We were there about 2pm on a Friday and the place was pretty empty. Regardless of that fact our server still forgot everything! He forgot drinks. He forgot sides. He forgot refills. He did not forget his snarky attitude when we asked for recommendations on what wasn't spicy. Oh but he did forget to tell us that things like guac and beans were spicy 

If you like spicy (which most of Arizona does apparently) try it here, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Connor waited our table and gave us good recommendations on the food. I ended up getting the green chili burger. Pretty good and comes with a lot of fries. 

They also have chips and salsa for $3.50. 

The environment is very nice, they have a mini water fountain inside."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in a cave with lots of sounds of running water.

I had a green chili machaca burrito. It was really good but turned out to be too spicy for me to eat all of it. I ended up having to order chips and salsa to have something else to try to get the hot taste out of my mouth. If the rice and beans didn't have so much green chili on them, then I could have eaten that instead of chips. Too bad almost all of the New Mexican entrees have green chili in them. Great flavor though!

My two dining partners both ordered the cheeseburger with fries. The seasoned fries were excellent and plentiful. The burgers looked delicious and they said they really liked them."}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is one of my ABSOLUTE favorites. Our server Kenny has already made his mark...a REAL pro.

Our check-in on Yelp qualified us for comped chips and salsa...maybe the finest salsa I've ever tasted. TREMENDOUS.

My stacked enchilada platter is on it's way. 

Done deal, put Carlsbad Tavern on your priority list. Truly one of of THEE BEST I've ever sampled."}
{"text":"So the last couple times I've been to Carlsbad I've been disappointed.  This place has really lost its luster.  The salsa now tastes like it comes straight from a can and there was such a huge layer of grease on my food that I couldn't figure out where my enchiladas stopped and the beans started.  Last night I went there with my mom and Grandma and the waitress was a huge snob, we didn't even want to tip her (of course we did).  It was so dark in the dining room that my grandma couldn't see the menu so she asked if they had a shredded beef burro. The waitress, in a condescending voice says, \"Yes, of course we do, what you want is a green chili burro\".   Gma then asked if that was spicy and she said, \"Not really\".  It came out so spicy that she couldn't even eat it.  The waitress did not offer to make her something else or take if off the bill, she was sooooo rude the entire meal, I won't even write about all the instances.  Her name was Michelle, so if you go there and she's your server you may as well get up and leave.   I really want to like Carlsbad, its within walking distance from my house and has a good concept... I just don't know if I can go back after my experience last night."}
{"text":"Came across the name of this restaurant and realized I had been here before.  I can't for the life of me remember what I ate but I do recall thinking that I wanted to go back.  The food was good--not excellent--but really good.  Loved the atmosphere too.  It was a fun environment to eat in."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very nice crowd, like sitting at bar for dinner, always find a congenial person(s) to talk to. Food: not as good as authentic New Mexican food served in New Mexico, but that's my opinion. Much better than average AZ Mexican type fare, have had blue corn enchiladas, very tasty but needed much more \"kick\". I like my Mexican food spicy, someone who prefers mild would be totally satisfied. I just kept dumping hot sauce on my food. 
Habanero burger: just a big, juicy burger with a lot of spice and nice sides, salad and fries. A great burger, but would be inclined to order from the Mexican dishes menu. After all a burger is a burger. I don't think you come to Carlsbad Tavern for a burger, you come for New Mexico type food.

Dined here some years back, my recollection was that the chips and salsa were free at one time, but of course not now. Considering chips and salsas are inexpensive ingredients, I think they should be gratis. Far less well known Mexican restaurants put a platter of chips and salsa in front of you when you sit down to dine. 

 All in all, a very pleasant atmospheric place to dine, bartenders very friendly and helpful, laid pack place to relax. I would NOT call this comparable to true New Mexico cuisine. I have not tries Los Dos Molinos yet, have heard they are authentic , wish they had a Scottsdale branch."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good drinks, and a decent late night menu. I recommend the kabob things for the late night menu (not named kabobs). 

Only bad thing is that the food can be too spicy. I like spicey food but what they spice the food with makes it a little too powerful sometimes."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Waterfall outside! Serves food late into the night! 

The food here is fantastic! It is a breath of fresh air when you can taste the love that an establishment has put into their food!

Will be back many times in the future. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nothing screams I'm in Arizona than waking up at 11:00AM and heading straight to Carlsbad Tavern for my late morning pina colada...all while sitting outside right by a mote. Please take note of the menus! They look like newspapers. I had the Spicy Lobster Croissant with a side of fries dipped in lemon aioli. Really? REALLY. (And REALLY REALLY GOOD). I just wish smoking was prohibited even in the outdoor seating portion of the restaurant. Major bummer when our neighbors decided to take a smoke (while they were eating...can't they just enjoy their food for a few minutes?) Aside from that, I thought it was a fun place to eat! When I was leaving the restaurant I noticed the indoor portion of the restaurant looked pretty small? Oh no... :-\"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix, bi-annual \"move the kid from the dorm\" trip. Looking for a good Mexican restaurant, one that a local we were dinning with, might not have tried. Every one of them had mixed reviews. If there were ten reviews with five stars there were two whining about something.

We chose the Carlsbad Tavern because there were good reviews about the food, great pictures, and the service sounded exceptional. The deciding factor was that the manager responded to almost every post. I hate writing these when I don't think anyone is reading them.

Several reviews raved about how wonderful a server Hannah was. After we were seated I asked my server if she was Hannah. She was not. I let her know that she had some mighty compelling Yelp reviews to surpass. Kristen did more that surpass them. She was pleasant, fast, attentive, helpful and above all smiling.

I promised to let this be known, and to clue everyone in that Hannah ain't got nothing on Kristen. Now, having not met Hannah, I will not assume that she is anything less than the reviews suggest. We look forward to returning, and giving her a run as well.

Oh, and the food was good as well. Definitely try the skinny margarita."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food!!! One of the first things I always try when I go to a new place is the Chiles Rellenos.  Its a great benchmark for the overall quality, \"tastyness\", and value of most everything on the menu.

Is the chili fresh and prepared well? (Hatch or not Hatch).  YES, YES, YES good job!  & fresh roasted Hatch chili!!!   Is the chili stuffed with a delectable Mexican cheese mix (or just  jack cheese)?  Well, this place uses a Good mix of jack & something else....no complaints.   What kind of batter? egg? breading?  Not sure but whatever they use it works well.

All in all, the Chiles Rellenos here are great!    Beware it's a very spicy dish so don't order it if you don't like it hot!  

My hubby ordered the fish & chips?  I know!   But they came and they are beautiful, crispy, large, flaky, flavorful, awesome!  Looks like they do a good job with everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Being a true New Mexican I couldn't help but do a u turn and check this place out. When you walk up there is a nice patio to your left with water falls and fire places. The bar area is very cozy and looks like a place I would come to just hang out for a drink or two. The hostess was so friendly and we talked a bit about me being a native New Mexican. She made some suggestions on the menu and asked what I like to eat in New Mexico. When I told her she brought me out a sample of the carne adovado and TRUE Hatch Green chile. My waiter was Kenny S and he was so funny. We hit it off right away. I ordered the Carne and to drink a Mexican Punch. The meal came and it was really good. I'm used to refried beans not black beans but they were good. The rice was dry and tasteless but he carne was so tender, I'm used to having it smothered with red chile so I ordered sour cream to off set the heat, not needed it wasn't covered in chile, this was a different change. The meat was seasoned perfectly and was so tender. A definite A+ there.  I had a Mexian Punch and all I can say is I plan on making thise at home. AMAZING!!!! All in all I would say they do New Mexican pretty well here. I plan on coming back again no doubt."}
{"text":"We've been there three times now and we LOVE the food. Would highly recommend that part to everybody. 

We DIDN'T enjoy having the hostess come to our table while we were talking after dinner and ask us to move to an inside table so that they could seat a large party that was coming soon. We really hadn't been sitting there for what we thought was a long time after dining. Made to feel uncomfortable, we decided to leave instead and noticed empty tables in the outside dining area, as well as others inside. It made us wonder why our table in particular was asked to relocate. It was an unwelcome experience that was new to all of us. Prior to tonight we had thought that this was going to be a place we would go to again and again...but maybe not now."}
{"text":"Came here last week in the afternoon with 11 people and sat outside. The lobster croissant is definitely something you should try, gets a little messy but definitely worth it. Didnt have a bloody mary but from what I heard from my friends that they can make it really spicy"}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is the Scottsdale version of Casa Bonita. I know, I know, there are no cliff divers, and there are no video games, but they both serve Mexican food, they both have a giant waterfall, and the whole place is like a cave so three out of five ain't bad. 

The staff here are all incredibly friendly. It looked like they actually enjoyed working there. And you can tell this place is family owned. It has a certain fun factor that corporate lawyers would most likely have advised against (examples being...the giant waterfall, outdoor canal, and large objects hanging tenuously from the ceiling). 

The food was pretty good. My dining companions complained of too much cheese, but this is \"New Mexico\" style Mexican food. What better way to \"Americanize\" something than to put giant portions of cheese all over it. Am I the only one who occasionally has a craving for a giant burrito covered in savory green chili sauce and melted monterrey jack?  As soon as I hear those magic words \"be careful,the plate is REALLY hot!\" I turn into a human version of Pavlov's dog. 

The margaritas were very good, and their tomatillo salsa was top notch."}
{"text":"The green chile sauce has a lot of flavor but the pork really is rather bland.  I opted to get the enchantment platter(?) - basically a try everything plate.  

By far the best thing was the chicken enchiladas.  It had good flavor, the meat was moist and seasoned.  Yum..  The pork stuff chile was decent too though a bit on the bland side.  I asked for pico de gallo which helped it a bit.  The carne acevedo(?) burrito wasn't bad, but even more on the bland side.  The sopapilla that came with the platter was pretty good, I didn't even put honey on it.  The worst thing about the plate was all the cheese.  I'm a fan of molty cheese, but this was just way too much.  There had to be like half a block on the plate.

We also tried the green chile pork stew which was decent..  The chile had a pretty big kick.  Somehow the dish didn't come together well.  Just tasted like veggie soup with green chile salsa in it.  The worst thing was the pork that was overcooked and dry in it.  

The pricing is a bit high, even for happy hour.  The atmosphere and menus are creative.  The service was pretty good when we went, but we were there early for lunch (~11am).  Decent place, maybe I'll try the nachos next time."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place that I had always heard of, but had never visited.  Great neighborhood hangout with good food, good service and good atmosphere - the prices were very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"I believe the habanero burger has destroyed my ability to detect heat and I love it. I come back as often as I can to pay for the privilege to have my tastebuds killed by this delicious burger."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot in Scottsdale! Neal is a pro server and the food is amazing! Love the filet mignon tacos and the cowboy meatloaf...there's nothing not delicious here!"}
{"text":"Not one to normally criticize but this place is highly over rated. First of all our waiter was terrible and the food was so so . We gave our waiter our order, which he never wrote down, he asked first for our drink order which he got totally wrong . He then brought me a Sangria which was all ice. After 30 minutes I finished the drink and my glass was still 2/3 rd's ice on a hot day. Our food was under flavored, after we had to repeat our order to him, my wife had the quesadilla's and I the chipotle chicken with noodles. The prices were high for what you receive. We will never return."}
{"text":"So I should have known this place was bad when I pulled up and there was no parking available but they had a valet service that conveniently had reserved spots. So after being FORCED to valet park my wife and I went inside and were promptly seated(kind of strange since there were no free parking spots). I ordered an green chilly cheese crisp for us to share and my entree was a green chilly pork burro. The cheese crisp was flavorless and unappetizing. The burro tasted like it had ben PRE-MADE and over cooked in the microwave upon order. The pork was dry and flavorless. I would not recommend this place to anyone because it's NASTY and does not do Arizona Mexican cuisine any justice at all.*****AVOID at ALL COSTS*****"}
{"text":"Good New Mexican flavor! Nice ambiance. Having more New Mexico beers to chose from would give it a five star rating, but overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"We are here for spring training. The Potstickers are like a routine out at first , but the runner on third scored with the play. The pork enchilada was soo dry I gave up & spit it out. Think pork jerky. Strikeout there. The thing I liked best, other then the fun decor, was the black beans. Which says alot."}
{"text":"We were looking for a decent Mexican restaurant to take out of town company to, near old town Scottsdale. This is New Mexican food rather than Mexican - but it was a perfect choice.
We made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night, and I would recommend doing that  as we still had to wait a few minutes before a table was free. 
It was a cold night, so we chose to sit inside, but we plan to return and sit outside on a warmer evening. There were plenty of people seated outside, under the propane heaters, even with outside temperatures in the 50s.
We all ordered a house specialty, designated by a little bat on the menu (the cave/cavern theme is way overdone - but very charming nonetheless). We were all very happy with our food. I had the carne adovada that other yelpers have raved about and it was everything they promised. The portion size is very generous, so we had the leftovers for lunch today. 
Our dinner bill was $65 for 4 full sized dinners - very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. 

The reason for the 4 star review is that we bought drinks in the bar while we were waiting for our table, and I was surprised by the cost of the margaritas. They were $9 each, and in a standard sized glass, that the bartender didn't even bother to fill to the top. He mixed them fresh for us, so that must be why it came up short, but for almost $20 for 2, he could have made a bit more. 

Our waiter was great, too. I asked if the adovada was spicy and while he assured me it was not, he also offered to bring me a sample. I took him up on it."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. It's like a New Mexico Disney land and the food is comparable to hospital cafeteria style mexican food. It's dreadful and just pathetic. Really just a waste of time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It is the neighborhood spot, and the food is terrific. I love just about everything they make.

The Enchantment Platter is a go to staple for me. It offers a little bit of everything. And when the chili's are in season they add the most amazing heat to an incredibly flavorful dish. This is not for out-of-towners with little experience with real chili's.

I love the atmosphere and the staff.  I have no qualms about bringing my kids when it isn't busy."}
{"text":"Hannah is  serving up  great food and  amazing service.  
Cool anniversary party today.."}
{"text":"I thought the best part was the ambiance outside by the waterfall.  The second best part was the pomegranate margarita.  The third best part was my portobello mushroom burger with chipotle mayonnaise."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood favorite. The bartenders here are the best. Also, love the patio and outdoor \"Oasis\". 

Can anyone tell me how many bats are in the cave?"}
{"text":"2am late night green chili.... Yes please.  Always great food, especially when no one else will serve you until that late.  An industry standard for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love the patio! Get there now before the weather is too hot. We had Happy Hour on a Sunday and that included fabulous prickly pear margaritas for $7 and other special prices on apps. The chicken chopped salad is a nice treat if you share a spicy dish with a friend. Ericka was super nice and all the staff is welcoming. We will be back."}
{"text":"So picture walking into the restaurant to the hostess station, a man whom I believe was the manager slouched over on the counter on the phone. The conversation was pretty chummy (a friend I imagine) as he felt maintaining his conversation, \"Did you get my text about Trump?\" was more important than seating my friend and I. 
He didn't say hello, didn't even look at us as he continued his conversation. We waited.....and waited.....then finally we just walked away and sat ourselves. 
Food was ok but we ordered a mix plate with a burrito, enchilada & relleno....burrito was the same size as the enchilada. 
Our server was very sweet. No complaints about him. A BIG thumbs down for the manager for being rude to the hand that feeds him!"}
{"text":"I'm from New Mexico and was raised on Hatch green chile.  Since moving to AZ I had given up on finding Mexican food that suited my taste buds.  This place completely satisfied my picky cravings.  The salsa was fantastic although next time I will ask for a hotter one.  They have a gorgeous patio and open till 2:00 am!  I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant.  Their food is consistently reliable, I always have great food and been going here for years.  The interior and patio is always very casual. I always enjoy sitting on the patio.  One of my fav's is the fish taco's and chili relleno's. Honestly, everything is good and their specials are a must try."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time i went to Carlsbad Tavern. I loved the atmosphere here. the food was absolutely amazing! the wait staff did an excellent job keeping every ones drinks filled promptly. their GM and Head Bartender are awesome people!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party of 4.  It was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead.  A few years ago I sat outside which was good, but this time I sat inside which was interesting.  The decor is pretty weird with bat stuff everywhere.  Nothing like it around I can tell you that.  The patio is also very interesting as well with a nice water element.

My first trip here was about 4-5 years ago and I tried to be hardcore and order their habanero cheeseburger.  I love love love spicy things but it was a bit over the top for me and I couldn't even finish it.  I was trying to be a bad ass in front of my then girlfriend (now wife) but I just couldn't choke it down.  It was very good but it was just way too spicy for my gringo mouth/stomach.

So on this trip I decided to sample some of their other, more mellow fare.  I was really looking forward to this because I am a big fan of New Mexican cuisine, spicy food, green chili, etc.

* Chips and Salsa - the chips are fresh and excellent.  The 2 salsas they give you I think were pretty fresh as well.  The mild one was ok but was a bit too chunky for me.  The green one had some heat to it but was just ok as well.  It had a weird taste like it had pickled chilis in it or something.

* Green Chili Cheeseburger - good sized, juicy and smothered in green chili sauce.  I ordered it without the bun and have absolutely no idea how someone can eat it with one because it would be a giant mess.  Anyway, I wasn't a big fan.  I just didn't like the taste of the green chili sauce and would have much preferred just strips of fresh roasted green chilies on top of the burger.  My meal came with a side salad which was eh.

* Green Chili Philly - My wife ordered this without the hoagie bun.  I had a taste and I did't think it was very good.  Had some heat to it, but it wasn't very flavorful.  And the flavor it did have was just eh.

* Green Chili Mac n' Cheese - This was my favorite part of the meal.  It wasn't the best mac n' cheese I've ever had but it was pretty good.  It was a bit too soupy instead of think and creamy, but it was good.  Very interesting with the green chili in it.

I wasn't a big fan of the service either.  Our waitress was cracked out.  She kept forgetting things and basically shoved a to-go box in my face before I was finished.  It was all pretty odd because she was friendly and was quick with my diet coke refills.  I think she must have been new to the joint.  I dunno.

I really don't know if and when I'll be back.  There are plenty of other places that serve kinda sorta the same food and this place really didn't stand out in terms of food or service."}
{"text":"Nice friendly and laid back not-quite-a-dive bar. We went for the reverse happy hour and they have a nice selection of beers, wine, drinks. Kind of typical bar food but we were ok with that. We got the nachos with chicken which were really good. Service was very friendly and on point. Check it out if you're in town!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food!!!!! The experience is great too. Our drinks were refilled as soon as they were out, and the chips and salsa are delicious!  I have been here multiple times, and never a disappointment. My family looks forward to eating here whenever we are in Arizona. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Decent food, mediocre service. We were in town for Spring Training, and while Adam and I are pretty open to trying new places, my aunt and uncle are less inclined. So we found somewhere (thanks, Yelpers) that seemed to have a pretty solid selection of Mexican food. And that's what we found.

The food is in no way mind-blowing, but it's different enough that you don't find everything on the menu at a standard chain Mexican place. Our drinks were tasty, and they have a pretty wide selection of cocktails and beer to keep the crowd happy. 

The ambiance is nice - even though it was pretty crowded, we were seated fairly quickly on the patio, and we didn't have to shout to have a conversation. Our service, though, was pretty mediocre, and we had to flag down our waiter several times because he would not regularly check on us. 

Overall, if we're back in Scottsdale next year, I'll probably venture somewhere new."}
{"text":"I'm originally from New Mexico, so when most places here in AZ say they have green chili on the menu, it's usually pretty weak. But man oh man Carlsbad Tavern has the real deal! I chose a green chili burritto stuffed with carne adovado and it was spicy in the best way. It was a huge portion so I was able to take half home for later:) My boyfriend tried the Food Network acclaimed Habenero Burger, and seemed to love every bite.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and the decore makes you feel like you're really eating in a cave. We sat inside, but the outdoor patio was just as awesome with a running waterfall I'm sure helps cool you off in the summer heat. 

Great menu, great beer selection and nice service. Highly recommended if you're up for some spice or a drink in a cool location, definatly not your typical \"Scottsdale\" bar."}
{"text":"I am one of those ethnic food party poopers who does not want heat in my food seasoning wise-hot spice deadens the taste buds while feeling the burn and i like to taste the nuances in food.  The lobster enchiladas were good but could not be ordered without the heat as they are delivered premade each day. Lobster is not a strong flavor so the heat really masked the seafood's flavor.  The rice and beans accompaniment were also great. Friend in our group raved about the marguerita. will return next time I am in the Phoenix area.
almost forgot-great outdoor seating beside a pondlike water structure."}
{"text":"Ryan is the best! Had a great time, and the food is so wonderful. Go here if you can!"}
{"text":"My husband is from New Mexico. We are always on the hunt for good New Mexican food. We did not find it here. The people were nice. Food was
mediocre. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, though I think it's more accurate to say it is inspired by New Mexican food. They were definitely light on the chili, and it was alright. It didn't help that the item I ordered was supposed to have red chili, I ended up with green instead. I might be spoiled by restaurants back in NM, especially since they use lots of chili. The sopapillas weren't very good, they weren't as light add they would be in NM and they were to sweet. I would need a really good reason to go back here. Next time I want new Mexican food, I'll plan a trip back to NM."}
{"text":"Went for first time. Hostess gave us the run down of everything great recommendations. Food and service was excellent. Definitely coming back this weekend. Try the Enchantment platter so good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere both inside and on the patio.  Food is good, and portions are large.  Prices are reasonable, service was on point."}
{"text":"Liked the water feature when you walk up the wooden pathway,  it is inviting. The food is Average as well as the service . Waiter could have mentioned check in promo on \"Yelp\" for free chips and salsa and this would have made all the difference ... it's the little things that matter... I would have tipped him the same amount... he did keep our ice tea filled without being asked ! Love that!"}
{"text":"So came here for a friends birthday. Yes we were a larger party (15 people) however we had called ahead and told server ahead of time for the check splitting. The server was not attentive. We sat for extended periods without drinks. Our water glasses were filled though because the busser was amazing.  Half the table waited for almost 40 mins to get the checks and to pay and there was still confusion about who's check was who's.  Will think again before coming here. Over 3 hours for a dinner..no thank you."}
{"text":"There chips and salsa was amazing and their prices are definitely reasonable for the quality of food that you get!"}
{"text":"We came in here to get drinks the other night before kickball and we've always wanted to come but have never taken the time to stop. This place is delightfully cute and interesting. It is a spin off of the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, as Mexican is their main cuisine. 

We didn't eat the first time, but the drinks were great and the bartender were friendly and surely added to the experience.

Lastly, we went back for food today and we got the Mexican Potstickers. Thy were absolutely delicious!! We also got the Caverns Salad, but that wasn't the greatest personally just kinda a bland salad and wish the greens were mixed greens instead of just iceberg lettuce. Just wasn't what I was expecting and the flavor wasn't there. Made me think twice about getting food there."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I'm partial to New Mexico's style of southwestern/mexican cuisine and Carlsbad does it right. Just had the enchantment platter, chicken blue corn enchilada with green chile, carne adovada burrito, and a chile relleno with a side of rice & beans and sopapilla. They'll top it off with the requisite fried egg if you ask too. Everything was fantastic,  service was great, and the atmosphere is fun. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Yum, Yum, Yum.

It's spicy, so wussies take note. 

I LOVE their blue corn enchiladas.... they're served on a big plate and all the sides run together and you can't tell what is what... MMM!

Their chicken enchiladas are also top notch.

Yum.

Highly recommended, especially for those with taste buds of steel :)"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Very unique decor beautiful patio fantastic food and great service! 

The dinner menu is awesome with a chef's feature nightly. I recommend sitting on the patio by the waterfall. The NM potstickers are heavenly! 

One of the few places to get good food after 10pm in Scottsdale, Carlsbad has a late night menu from 10 to close with drink specials as well 

And on Sunday's don't miss the delicious brunch menu and Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try Carlsbad Tavern and after I did everything was A-OK. The atmosphere inside actually trumped the food. I am not sure if I didn't get the right item on the menu or what it was. I ordered the blackened chicken wrap which was stuffed with blackened chicken, spinach, jalapeño bacon, roasted corn, tomatoes, guacamole ranch in a spinach tortilla.  The wrap is served with a side of chile avocado salsa....... Not my favorite.....

Another issue was the water, I couldn't even drink my glass and the lemon didn't help!"}
{"text":"Really beautiful exterior and interior landscaping, ambiance, and architecture. The water features are beautiful, and the palm trees tie together the whole look. The staff was all very friendly from the host to the bartender to the people delivering food. The bartender, I'm not sure his name, made us feel right at home even though we had never been before. The salsa & guac for the chips and salsa/guac were all really delicious and fresh. The main dishes we had - shrimp tacos and quesadilla - were pretty good too. The reason for 4 stars is because the drinks are very spendy and small. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The potsticker were delicious. The green chile stew was a bit too spicy for my taste. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but I have to knock off a star and remove Carlsbad Tavern from my \"Best of\" list. My last experience there wasn't very good. Overall, I still love this place. I've taken out-of-towners here, and will still return myself. However, my last experience there makes me hesitant to recommend it to everyone.

The flavor of the food we ordered was bland, and the temperature was much too close to lukewarm for my liking. The Lobster Enchiladas were meager, tepid, and the flavors didn't really meld. We've ordered these before and they were much more bountiful and robustly flavored. The fish tacos were \"Bleh.\" No flavor and they smelled profusely like fish--which often means the fish isn't very fresh. I don't often order seafood in the desert because of the freshness factor, but I thought I was safe at Carlsbad. Maybe not.

The service was good, thankfully; and they offered to replace my meal with something else. I took them up on the offer, and the replacement meal was much better than the one I sent back. Still, Carlsbad Tavern wasn't the type of place from which I expected to receive a sub-par meal. I can only really say now that it's 4-star good, and not 5-star amazing. Hopefully my next experience there makes me want to add the fifth star back."}
{"text":"The entrance with the awesome waterfall and great looking patio had me excited for something special! It was busy and bustling so I expected a possible stellar dining experience, I mean with a full house on a Thursday evening, it's gotta be good.

It happened to be 114 outside which might explain why all three of my beers were cool... not cold. I had the snapper tacos. Fish in Arizona is always sort of a gamble, but I have had better tacos made from fish sticks. The spice was interesting but not compelling. I didn't get to choose my tortilla preference, that's okay... but the overall dish was strangely out of place and lacking any sort of excitement or originality.

Service was good, friendly and attentive. So this in no way is a negative for the staff... unless you are the head chef."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why this place gets good reviews or how they are still in business. I have been in Scottsdale for 8 years and passed this place countless times. Friends told me this place is not good but I decided to try it myself. 

It was a Thursday night and not too busy. Apparently they weren't busy on Wednesday because the meat in my burrito and my rice were left overs from Wednesday if not Tuesday. The meat was old and extremely dried out. My rice was hard. They also don't use seasoning. Not only was it old but there was no flavor at all. 

There are plenty of good Mexican restaurants not too far from this one. Save yourself the grief and find another place to eat.

This is a follow up to the Manager who felt the need to resopnd and tell me that I'm wrong. I have in fact had New Mexican style food before both in the valley and Santa Fe. The food had NO seasoning. Second the rice was old and dried out. It was actually hard. That is not New Mexico style that's just old. I had a shredded beef burrito. The meat is in fact not cooked to order as you would suggest because it would take too long. The meat was so overcooked it was completely dry. It sat in broth or on a steam table all day. Please don't confuse users as to New Mexican as it has nothing to do with your poor food quality."}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least a half a dozen times & I absolutely love it! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but as soon as you walk in you are pleasantly surprised with their outside patio and water features! They have an excellent happy hour as well. I was brave and tried the Habanero cheeseburger one night & it was fierce! It was delicious going down, but I regretted it the next day! Haha... I also love the Cavern Chicken Salad & the Lobster Enchiladas! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Has gone down hill so drastically!!! I was a regular here for years when Tolan was a manager. The food was delish and service was always on point. I have maybe skipped by for a year now. I did not recognize more than 1 face ( a younger guy server). My boyfriend and I walked in to ask for dining for 2. There was an older lady as a hostess maybe in her 50s. She said one table left. I kindly asked okay no booths by chance when I saw several open. She repeated herself verbatim but so rudely \"One table left.\"  I look at her confused by her tone. She sat us in the back and our serve has 4 tables from what I saw. She was nothing extraordinary with her customer service. I asked for my usual filet minon quesadilla. She said I think that's only for happy hour. Walked away 10 feet to another server and came back saying yeah we can't do that. Now keep in mind I have been there for years different days a week different times. Happy hour and non happy hour. They have never refused to make it. I ordered tacos and the server rushes us to pick. Food came out & food was bland and so disappointing. I tip over 20 percent and am not super picky. But rude hostess, unwilling staff, awful food. Used to love this place. Never going back. I read all the recent reviews since new owner. Sorry carlsbad but you lost your oldtown rating to me"}
{"text":"What a neat place!  Very unique decor and really cool outdoor dining area. The food was very good and the margaritas were excellent!!  Portions were large. We will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I had the pastrami on a pretzel roll which I felt overpowered the meat and cabbage. I got that adage, \"where's the beef\" I am saying there has to be more meat or less bun. Wife had a Mexican dish and was very happy with it. Someone/ owner needs to pay more attention to detail as the feel of the place get lost without more attention. One top of a wall was a planter box with a consumer label still stuck to it. We got bit by mosquitos outside on the patio thinking not the water in the ponds but the pooling of lawn water outside the entrance. Don't know if the front is policed by staff b4 opening 4 day but drinks were left on ledge of entrance wall at noon. 
The french fries and  were very good. We don't go out that much and wanted a sort of special treat and we were overall pleased. Say thanks for the mild May temps. for that."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! 

I have been going here for years, and absolutely adore this restaurant.  The place is dimly lit (even during the day) and boasts a huge patio. The bar has a bunch of kitschy crap all over the wall that is fun to look at. 

Without going into a huge story about all the times I've been here, I'll just list all the food I love:
 Portales Portobello, Sweet Mash, Boneless Chicken Wings (late night menu only), Cheese Crisp, seasoned fries, Spinach Salad, Spicy Crab Cakes, Green Chile Burger, Habenero Burger (it is good, freakin spicy, and comes with a glass of milk), Tortilla Soup, Green Chile Stew, Chile Rellenos, Carne Adovada Plate, Green Chile Mac and Cheese (late night menu), Key Lime Pie, and Basket of Sopas. 

I bet I am forgetting some things, but basically, all I am trying to say is that this place is the bomb diggity. 

OH! They also have a really great Sunday brunch with cheap breakfast, bloodies and mimosas."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan.  A frequent patron for 10+ years.   This weekend my father and I went for lunch;   the Carne Adovada was very good, however the Pozole was cool and fatty.   And the Tesuque salad was lacking dressing, and the chicken was bland.   Could be a hit if better prepared.   I will visit again."}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is a little...different. The food was great, don't get me wrong. The typical \"Mexican\" portion of their menu was small, but the food off of it was delicious and plentiful. We sat inside instead of out on the patio because it was a cooler night, and I think that that took away from the experience. The outside patio looked awesome. The inside is, again, a little...different. Very much tavern-like, with bat replicas everywhere, and not very Mexican/New Mexican like. A Hoj Poj of a restaurant, if you will."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in how this has gone downhill. Went for lunch today with a party of 9. The restaurant was not crowded at all. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and 4 bowls of soup to split between 4 of us. The chicken inside of the quesadilla was cold and the soup was luke warm. When I told our server he told me it was probably because of the sour cream and walked away. He returned with some other food and with attitude offered to \"throw my soup in the microwave\". I declined that offer. He left the table and came back to let us know they had a fresh batch of soup that was boiling hot and they would replace our soups. They brought the fresh soup and only 1 had sour cream in it. I asked for sour cream in the others and he told me there was sour cream in all of them. But there was not. Again, attitude. I asked for the manager. The server came back with the big stainless steel bin with sour cream from the kitchen and plopped it into each of our soups (awkward and with attitude). Manager came over and agreed with server that sour cream was in all soups and didn't really comment on the servers attitude at first. Then he said he would talk to him. We pointed out the burned hamburger bun for a kids meal on the other side of the table and he agreed it was burnt and said he would talk to the kitchen about it. No offer to replace it. We were NOT being high maintenance only asking for what we ordered to be cooked and served properly. The server never apologized and we were charged for every item on our bill. We tipped 10% only because I feel a tip is part of the deal on eating out. I am sad to say I will never go back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Their steaks are the bombdotcom and they make the best chips and salsa in the area. 

Great staff plus great decor and amazing grinds mean they have a customer for life."}
{"text":"I found this on the Check Please website, read reviews and decided to go there with my husband and best friend. Everything was extremely bland, we tried 5 different items' from the happy hour menu, several items were obviously frozen and then warmed and served. The chicken on the nachos was very dry and the sauce for the potstickers tasted like it was a powder. This is the first time that I have been disappointed with a recommendation from Check Please and I will not be back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me out here for a belated birthday dinner. I have always wanted to try this place so it was a welcome surprise. We were seated on the patio since it was a nice evening however me being the wimp that I am, I had them turn on the heater because it was a little cooler than I thought ( plus it didn't help that I had a a very thin top but that is another story lol)

We ordered Mai Tai's for our drinks and let me tell you those suckers were strong. Luckily for me I was not driving and my dinner companion sipped his sparingly. We had the Mexican Potstickers as an appetizer however although they were good, they were quite salty.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Poblanos as my main course and my friend ordered Chorizo Stuffed pork chop. Baby, my Poblanos were stuffed with so much crab!! OMG it was soo good. They were huge as well So big that I even after sharing I ended up taking one whole one and a half one home with me. My friend's stuffed pork chop was delicious and the red chile cheddar mash potatoes had just the right kick. He too ended up taking half his meal home because the portion was so good. Oh and if you think I am complaining, believe me I am NOT by any means. I also ordered a pina colada later on (as again I was not driving) and that too was just as strong. They do not skimp on the alcohol and I was very happy about that.  Nothing like spending $9 on a drink and you can't taste any alcohol.

Now although were were stuffed to the gills, we also ordered a piece of key lime pie to share. Delicious to say the least. With the exception of the ultra salty mexican pot stickers, the serve, the food, and most importantly the company was fantastic. If I am ever in the area again, I may have to check out there happy hour."}
{"text":"Loved it! Simply thee best green salsa Ive ever had! Check in on Yelp for free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and great atmosphere. I had the Ribeye and it was excellent! Couldn't finish it, but if I make it back down here for work again, I will be coming here."}
{"text":"Great service and very very good food. Explore.  It won't hurt. They will tell you when you are getting hot.  The flavor on the Osso Bucco is amazing.  The chorizo stuffed pork chop is very good.  The house salad with the kicked up ranch dressing is great.  Sunday special buy one dinner the other is 1/2 off made it a bonus.  Margaritas a little pricey but the house ones are good.
People around us had the fried chicken and they wolfed it.  
Only down is that it is very dark and can get loud.  Outside dining is great when it is cool or not raining.  Use your flash lite app to be adventurous on the menu."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star rating, very consistent which is a trait high on my radar.

This \"is\" New Mexican cuisine, which translates to hatch pepper green sauce and sopapillas. After that the sky is the limit with variations and combinations of cooking styles. 

And vary it does!

At Carlsbad there are 3 distinct dining areas, The Bar, The Cave, The Grotto. Each area presents a completely different atmosphere and draws corresponding cliental. 

Casual fine dining in \"The Cave\". 

Trendy down in \"The Grotto\".

 You will find the regulars in \"The Bar\".

I prefer eating \"fine dining food\" at the bar, because that's how I roll. The bar tenders are witty and quick with a joke and light up your smoke if you know what I mean? The drink strengths vary by the bartenders. 

Its very dark and low key and you will drive right by the entrance if you are not careful. Carlsbad is also one of the few places in town that serve late night food. You have to try this place out for yourself, nothing else like it in the valley. 

My kind of place!"}
{"text":"Hooooray! Carlsbad now has a house wine available all the time for $5 and it is good. We had not been back in a year because the wine was so expensive. Had the Carne Adovado and the braised Chicken and it was crispy with an adobo/chipotle rub, both were excellent. Tracey was our waitress and fantastic. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"One word here - Burgers

The open faced green chile burger is supernaturally good.  I think I'm possessed by a green chile demon from eating it.  

The Patty Melt is uberbomb too.  

I haven't ventured far from the burgers, but I know the Chile Rellenos are solid as is the Blue Corn Enchiladas."}
{"text":"Reliable and delicious southwestern cuisine in a comfortable and unique bat cave atmosphere! Staff is friendly and efficient. Both the inside and outside dining areas are cozy and clean. My favorites on the menu are the potstickers, crab cakes, and the meatloaf. The bartenders are super cool and know how to mix up great drinks. The bar is a great place to relax with your favorite cold adult beverage and an appetizer and watch a ball game any night of the week."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times now and like the place more and more each time i go.  With Mexican food abundant all over the area, the food here is awsome for a very good price.  the outside area is great with the waterfall and all.  Great all around.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"What can I say about CT that hasn't already been said.  We've been coming here for 10 years (and have even been to their former Scottsdale Rd location) and they put a great spin on New Mexico cuisine.  Their carne adovada is my favorite in town and their outside patio is great in the season.  Have been to all the New Mexico places (Los Dos, Richardsons, Secreto, Arriba) and this is definitely our favorite (although Secreto in Ahwatukee is good too)."}
{"text":"Best place for food after 10. Looking for a late night burger?  Get the Cholula Burger side of Chipotle mayo.  It is awesome. Ask for Jay or Liz.   Best food and service around!"}
{"text":"Very diverse menu, we've been here 3 times and each time we had a great experience.  Just a heads up if you didn't catch it most dishes have some degree of spice to it for anyone who cant take heat."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Tex-Mex -New-Mexican Inspired cuisine. The atmosphere is fun and interesting. They offer a large patio with a large water feature and inside looks like a cave. When we entered we were greeted and sat promptly. 

I started with a Margarita..The margarita was fine but it was garnished with a lime that has seen better days and maybe the dishwasher already. I know it's a little thing ...... I didn't feel like complaining about it but it turned my stomach and I was sort of afraid about what dinner would be like.

For dinner I had the Filet Mignon. My steak had really nice grill marks on it and was cooked to my liking. The steak seemed unseasoned and neither me or my husband could taste the pecan wood or salt or pepper. It was just plain beef. I didn't see beans in my plate's description but they sat my steak over a pile of beans that I didn't want so my husband took them. My steak came with mushroom and cheese enchiladas. The mushrooms were seasoned nicely and tasted good but the cheese inside tasted like process American Cheese that I don't care for. I NOTE that this doesn't mean this is bad it only means I would prefer a different cheese. My husband tasted the enchiladas too and he confirmed that they taste like processed American cheese. I wasn't expecting that...My enchiladas were also a little dry. I didn't think my plate was bad enough to send back or complain about because the beef was ok and the enchiladas were just a little dried out. I know I ruined the flavor of the enchiladas by using the Carlsbad Hot Sauce on them but the sauce juiced them up and the Carlsbad hot sauce is mighty tasty.

My husband had the Carne Adovada. He said it was ok but the pork was dry.

Our server was very pleasant and we were thanked for coming.

I feel I hit them on an off night because when I look at other people's pictures of the same food their pictures of the food look much better. Their food looks moist and melty cheesy unlike our plates.

2.5 stars rounded up because of service and the interesting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Okay so the 'feel' of the restaurant is really cool, but the food on the other hand was mild in flavor. I've had way better Mexican at way cheaper places."}
{"text":"It was a first visit dinner to Carlsbad Tavern and they hit it out of the park.  
Starting with their Tequila Shrimp appetizer served on an amazing black bean creation was love at first bite.  The way they prepare Ribeye steak is phenomenal...melt in your mouth perfection.  The crab stuffed poblano pepper was terrific.  Even the spicy mashed potatoes were memorable. 
Washed it all down with a couple of their very tasty signature five star Prickly Pear Margaritas. 
Delicious. 
An interesting and comfortable rustic ambiance complete with running \"river\" creates a unique spirit of New Mexico.  Instantly on my top five Phoenix restaurants list.  
I have to go back again. Can't help it.  It's calling to me.  Three thumbs up. 
GO!   I doubt you would be disappointed."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the very first time tonight. I loved the environment! Small and cozy but still perfect for a date or private talking. Our server Hannah was attentive and incredible the entire night. I knocked off two stars because our tab was over $300 and the bar tender wasn't willing to switch out a shot of whiskey for tequila that we accidentally ordered. For the amount of money we spent here I feel like that was an easy request."}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"The potsticker appetizer had sounds coming out of my mouth that may have had ppl wondering what was going on - you have try it! The blue corn enchiladas were amazing and the deep fried ice cream was probably the best I've very had. I didn't like the smell inside but will go back as long as I can sit outside- great patio."}
{"text":"Sucks when a place has descent food I wouldn't mind trying again..rice was way dry like way dry..relleno and shrimp tacos very tasty....but I'm a server and it all comes down to service this idiot Steve was basically on autopilot trying to just get money and lesve..our first time in and gave him our drink order one at a time cause he took mine and decided to walk away...come back blah blah it was horrible...won't be back :/"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this place.  The patio is really cozy and I would recommend sitting out there.  I have only had the late night menu but I always enjoy my food and the margs are good too.  Try the green chili quesadilla...so delish.  P.S. The patio can be slippery because of the waterfall. I face planted it the other night and my boyfriend is STILL laughing. Be careful!"}
{"text":"Good carne adovada which is one of my favorites. Habenero Cheeseburger (comes with a glass of milk) will light your @@@ on fire too. Cool unique ambiance, nice menu, good staff, service has always been very good. Hint: nice late night Happy Hour for you restaurant peeps kitchen open late til like 1AM or so! 

One thing that I dont like is that they dont allow dogs on their huge (often empty) patio. My dog even has service dog tags and the owner wouldnt let him in so we dont go on Sundays anymore with the folks. I dont mark em down for this, but some people ONLY go where they can bring their dog and they could do it here and it would be awesome. We just go somewhere else now instead. Read this and start letting dogs there and we will throw a huge Yappy Hour on the patio and pack the place dude!"}
{"text":"This place is cute.  I was a little intimidated when I checked the menu online and there were no $$ signs.  To me that always means pricey but I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and look at the Mexican food selection to find that everything was under $15.

So my first disappointment was paying for the chips and salsa.  Paying, really?  The waiter was generous with the salsa and chips but that still disappointed me.

Food:
Chips and salsa-  Salsa wasn't good.  I mean it was OK but being a Mexican food lover, I've tasted many salsas in my day and this was mediocre at best.

Chile Rellenos-  These were delicious and would highly recommend them.  Also, the rice is fantastic.  Not the biggest pork fan but I still found these amazing.

Machaca & Tomatillo Chimichanga- Also delicious. I mean it is a deep fried burrito but still very well done.

Sopas- you can add a sopapia for .75 each.  We each had one which came with honey as our dessert.  They were very good and not too much or too little.

Service:
Fan-freakin- tastic.  Our server was great.  He was extremely attentive and friendly.  


So this place is more like 3 1/2 stars probably but we ate at Dick's Hideaway the next night which was much more impressive and thus, because I am comparing, I have to give this 3 stars.  I would recommend it and come back!"}
{"text":"Food is very good here, Specials are often superb. I have had the Carne Adovada which is very good. They used to have an excellent rib eye, and I was quite miffed when they stopped selling them. The waiter told me they could not get a consistent product and cost were high. I find that hard to believe but whatever.

I have also tried the Habanero cheese burger. This is not for the faint of heart. I tried it 2 times. The first time it was not as hot as I expected. I did see another older couple who both ordered it and it was quite humorous (to me) the husband took one bite and got this very unhappy face, and never took another bite. his wife ate the whole thing.

The second time it was definitely hotter, almost too hot for me to eat. I was sweating up a storm. but it was very good. If you think you like spicy food watch out this burger is way hotter than you think. If you think taco bell is spicy then don't even think of trying this burger.

I would like to see their menu change more often, and maybe serve more dishes with lamb chops. Bring back the rib eye!

All the margaritas are excellent here."}
{"text":"Their adovada is amazing, slow roasted; that's what you should come for.  The chips + salsa are not complimentary, but the chips are specially spiced, and the salsas are very good.

If you & a friend or date want to try a variety of things, the Enchantment Platter includes the adovada, some good chicken, and a chile relleno.  It's enough food for two.  I think there was a $5 second plate charge, but it's still a decent deal.

I need to try their machaca in red chile sauce next time I go."}
{"text":"So amazing!! The food is only surpassed by the talented staff! I've loved this place for 8 months, and I typically only review when I'm angry. Kristen, Tyler, Lottie, Neil, Art, and Liz are only a few of the memorable artists in the trade!  If you want a great drink with amazing smiles, Carlsbad tavern is your place!"}
{"text":"Awesome AWESOME atmosphere.  Especially when its not an inferno outside on their patio...surrounded by chili pepper lights and a small creek complete with foot bridge and tiki-ish bar...  Carlsbad Tavern is one of my favorite spots.

I love sitting outside but as it really was an inferno when I was there last week, I had to get aquainted with the inside bar area.  Not much different, chili pepper lights and New Mexico license plates... excellent music and good vibe all around.  

Spending most of my early 20s in the Midwest, I hadnt had a whole ton of New Mexican food before but let me tell you, I am now a whole hearted fan.  Lots of green chile menu items, burritos, enchiladas...  My recent favorites are the crab stuffed green chiles, and the carlsbad chicken salad.  HUGE portions so bring your apetite.  

Prices are average but great for the amount of food you get...between $8 and $25 for steaks etc.  Perfect service, friendly staff.

Dont forget to try a prickly pear margarita--best in town!!"}
{"text":"I went back to Carlsbad Tavern, because I had been dreaming about the Carne Adovada plate. Remember my last review; the burrito was To die for!

So I ordered the plate, and was really disappointed. Like so sad I couldn't really eat my meal. I would like to first say that I think it is more of a personal reason than Carlsbad Tavern's issue. I grew up with Mexican Food, not New Mexican food. So when you get a plate with meat, you get salsa, sour cream (very gringo, btw) and other sauces, for lack of a better word! With the Adovada, it was meat, beans, tortillas, and rice. No sauce nothing to make it more interesting.

So I took most of my meal home and doctored it up the next day.

Lesson learned, order the burrito if you want Carne Adovada. Although Next time I go back, I will for sure get the Chile rellenos. I am sure they will be as good as I remember!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST chile rellenos EVER!!
My server, Elizabeth, was fantastic. She gave me just the right amount of attention-not too much, but didn't ignore me. I haven't been there in a while, and forgot just how great it is!!"}
{"text":"Much better than the Tortilla Factory!  It's not traditional Mexican food, but it isn't bad, the chips were warm and the machaca was very good.   Phoenix really needs to take notice from Tucson and Albuquerque on how to do good, down-home Mexican food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with a pond right next to our seat. We started with the chips and salsa but sadly the salsa wasn't very flavorful. Ordered the enchantment platter as well as the habanero burger. The enchantment platter was delicious but the burger wasn't as spicy as expected. Service was alright. A little slow and was forgetful at times. Still will probably come back to try more."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!! This place is fantastic! A HIDDEN GEM!! It all starts with the atmosphere and is added to by an incredible staff and food that was satisfying and delightful! It was one of the most peaceful and enjoyable meals my wife and I have had in a long time. The patio is our favorite place to site as the setting is priceless. Highly recommend Carlsbad Tavern!"}
{"text":"The BEST place in scottsdale hands down! They have the BEST margaritas! They make their own mix and its NOT sweet! LOVE LOVE it! The bartenders are amazing not to mention there isn't a thing on the menu that we haven't tried that wasn't amazing! Check it out! Great atmospher for scottsdale totally chill, no heels needed!!! Order the Chimayo Chicken its my fav, I could eat it daily!!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here (02/18/11) with a friend and the food was yummy!  Our server was a little inattentive which was a little bothersome because they weren't busy, but the host more than made up for her attitude with his charm!  

They have a good selection of beers (I had the kiltlifter) and we shared some chips, salsa, and guacamole which was all fresh and tasty.

My friend had the green chile open face burger and I had the green chile philly sandwich.  My sandwich was loaded with meat and it was delicious with just the right amount of heat and melted cheese. 

All in all a cute place with good basic food and a good beer selection!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, the margaritas hit the spot, and the service is great.  The atmosphere is a little cheesy but overall it's a great place to go!!"}
{"text":"First time into Carlsbad Tavern. Shocking since I've lived in the valley for so long. Immediately coming into the lot there were no parking spots available, so I had to park across the street and walk over. Their atmosphere was quite interesting, I wish my friends had opted to sit on the patio rather than in the bar area. 
Being there 2 hours we probably saw our server 5 or 6 times who only came by when drinks were empty already or someone new came to join. He also copped a little attitude when we needed to split the check so we separated everything for him. Am I wrong or do POS systems not have seat numbers on them? My flautas were OK and my margarita was awful but the rest of my party said the food was pretty good here most of the time, I suppose I'll have to come back and give it another shot. 
One big pro though... When we left we realized there was a wait for tables. The atmosphere was so calm and people weren't crammed into the bar area while they waited. That is something they are definitely doing right. Stay posted for an updated review."}
{"text":"All I have to say is STACKED ENCHILADAS!!!  All day!! You must have these. And you must have the margaritas. Darrell hooks it up, best bar tender ever!  Love this place. Dinner out or late night bite to eat, you must go to Carlsbad!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Carlsbad Tavern in about a year, and we decided to go back last night.  I found the food on par with a former visits, but the service was very disappointing.  It was very difficult to get our server's attention with all of the tables he was managing.  I had to chase him down so we could place our order.  He forgot to deliver me my sour cream, but yet presented me a bill where I was charged.  I don't remember service ever being an issue in the past, so I certainly hope they can change this soon."}
{"text":"We usually descend in a large group later in the evening and the staff are always friendly and the food consistently good."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere, average service, creative menu.  I've had the habenero hamburger & lobster enchiladas.  Love the fact that you get 3 salsas with your chips and a slew of hot sauces to add some heat to your meal."}
{"text":"Elizabeth served us and was great. Food was excellent, and she was so nice. Ordered the beef tacos. But I wish they would included chips in the cost instead of charging by the order."}
{"text":"I went to the Carlsbad tavern during a business trip and was not disappointed.  I want to go back for more.

Atmosphere / Service:   I sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  I placed an order for their chips w/ two salsas.  Something happened and my order never came out.  The bartender apologized and comp'd me for the mistake.  Atmosphere was comfortable and fun

Food:  I ordered the enchantment platter.  It came with a adovada burrito, a chicken enchillada, and the chile relleno.  It was fantastic.  the adovada burrito was the best part. will get those again next time."}
{"text":"Expensive, but good.  Go for the ambiance, but stay for the food.  The patio is wonderful, it never got too hot even though it was the middle of the afternoon; but then again I didnt come in the middle of july when being outside is the equivalent of living in an oven.  If it gets too hot, just order another drink.  They come in a nice sized glass and are plenty strong.  Bring friends, drink a lot, and have a good time."}
{"text":"What a find.  Loved it.  Great atmosphere, good food, and good service. Will be back for sure.  Only down side for me was the huge tv's on patio, which were turned on about 10 minutes before we left, for sports, I think. Kind of ruins the ambiance.  But such a fun find.  Thanks yelp."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Carlsbad many times, and I'm always happy.  The spice level is still really inconsistent though.  If I ever order green chile stew again, I will ask for a sample first.  The last time it was so hot, I could not eat it.  Do you realize how hot something has to be for me to waste it?  

But we did recently go for Sunday brunch for the first time, and it was good!  I had eggs benedict with jalapeño hollandaise.  The eggs were properly poached and the hollandaise was spicy, but not too much so.  As a side note, whoever was in charge of those potatoes had an accident with the salt shaker.  Waaayyy too salty.

Oh, and most importantly, they have bloody mary's for $3.25.  Yes, $3.25.  Mimosas, too.  I know the current trend is bottomless, but I usually only order one or two anyway, or my whole day is shot because I'm stuck on the sofa in a drunken, overstuffed stupor.  Beautiful patio weather right now, too!"}
{"text":"I really do not understand why the reviews are so good.  The food was very mediocre and it smelled like old beer in the restaurant.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"A go-to whenever I'm back in the Scottsdale area.

Just a cool place with unusual, kitchy vibe, good food, solid margaritas, and staff that make you feel like a regular even if you're not.

Their outdoor patio, with a huge fountain, is perfect for brunch when the weather permits. Their darkish bar is perfect for those hot Arizona happy hours where you want to escape the heat and enjoy a tasty beverage.

If you're into spicy food, don't miss their habanero burger. It's out of this world!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years - dating back to when it was in an old coffee shop on Scottsdale Road before they moved into the current Bat Cave - and the food never disappoints. The stacked enchiladas are my favorite, complete with the fried egg on top to make everything better. The carne avobada is always tender, and all of the dishes pack plenty of heat. Service is friendly. You can't come to Scottsdale and not eat here at least once."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious, spicy food with excellent margaritas and dessert to finish. 

So glad to have listened to these reviews and make our way here tonight.
You'll get a great meal. And our waitress was phenomenal to boot.

Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in over a year, but back in the day I was there every Tuesday night and had a great time.  Great food, great staff."}
{"text":"I seriously love me some Carlsbad!  I love that happy hour and those delicious margaritas and those yummy potstickers... I think my stomach just growled!  The potstickers are chicken and sauteed in a soy-like sauce and served with a sweet creamy corn sauce on the side of the plate... It's fantastically salty, sweet and savory.  They also do a pretty tasty sopapilla. 
The inside is a bit dark, but its a cave right?  And they have a killer patio with water falls when its not blazing hot outside.  
Note: I hear their lobster enchiladas are killer (though i don't eat seafood) and the Habanero burger got Food Network magazine's best burger in AZ!"}
{"text":"I haven't had New Mexican food in about three years!  Mention a sopapilla in California and you will end up with a corn cake about a quarter of an inch thick on your plate (sope).  So I was pumped to find Carlsbad Tavern!  

I'm into campy stuff so the whole tavern cavern theme was appealing to me.  It's like dining in a cave.  They have a great patio too but I don't do 115 degree dining...no sir!  

The food was pretty good and what I expected for Scottsdale.  The hubs got a Enchantment Platter and I got the Calsbad Tacos.  I enjoyed the hubs plate more than mine so I kept stealing his food.  If you haven't had New Mexican food and don't know what to order get the Enchantment platter!  It comes with a carne adovada burrito, chicken enchilada, a chili relleno, all smothered in red and green chili (Christmas style) with a sopapilla on the side. Ahh that hatch green chili burn!  It is so different from all the other chiles.  It cannot be described it just needs to be experienced.  The sopapilla was a little dense and flat.  I so wished it was soft pillow-y, puffy, and cloud like but no...oh well.

My tacos were served on those bigger tortillas which is what I was raised on in NM.  The filet mignon was kind of tough.  The flavors were were good and I appreciated the gobs of cheese (NM style!) but was a little disappointed in the texture.

Overall, it was a decent meal in a fun environment."}
{"text":"We were there very early this evening, so that may be the reason we had a less-than-5 star experience... We ordered off the happy hour menu -- crab cakes and potstickers. We also ordered the green chili mac and cheese. 

The food was VERY good, for bar food. Nice spice in the crab cakes and the aioli that came with them -- and the salad greens on the plate were outstanding. The pot-stickers were okay, but not on the same level. The mac and cheese was good -- but could have used a few more minutes under the broiler to make them a little less soupy. 

We got a side order of guac and should have gone with the full order. 

Where Carlsbad lost us though, was the margarita. I know it was somewhat my mistake -- I ordered the house marg and asked them to substitute Grand Marnier. When the marg arrived, I couldn't taste any GM and asked the waitress to check if maybe it had been left out. She shouted over to the bartender to confirm that he had added the GM -- and of course he said he had... Oh well, without the taste of the GM, it was just a plain old margarita. I would have paid $5 for a decent dose of GM, but whatever. 

I decided to pass on the margarita and just drank my water instead. The margarita sat on the table untouched throughout the meal and the waitress never asked about it. It would have been a nice touch to have had her at least offer to get me something else... 

So I'm knocking a star off for service... 

But the outside patio IS great looking and I recommend you head out there when you arrive. I'm not sure why this place shows up as a tapas bar in the Yelp listing, but it's really not a tapas place. It's a New Mexico themed bar/restaurant with very good food and I'm sure most of the staff is very good as well, judging from the other reviews... Don't pass this up on my account -- but do remember my experience when ordering your margarita..."}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert! If you've ever driven on Hayden, traveled north from Thomas and passed by Carlsbad Tavern without stopping in, you're missing out! This is a charming little eatery complete with twinkle lights and a huge moat-like water fountain that surrounds the patio. 

The atmosphere is casual and perfect for large groups. I celebrated a birthday here several years ago and have been for dinner several times. The interior is cozy and feels like you're truly in a cavern and the patio is charming with the sound of water while you eat under the twinkle lights. It's perfect for a casual but ambiance-filled date night, perfect if you have young children and need a place that allows noise and perfect for any sized group. 

The food here is New Mexican and has a serious kick to it (in a good way). It appears that you must ask for salsa upon request. The salsa is very chunky and decent but the tomato chunks can make it hard to dip chips. The nachos are made with chipotle chips which is a nice change-up to typical nachos. Their go-to item is the Green Chile Burrito which is delicious. The combination of red and green sauce adds a kick and adds the perfect amount of \"mess\" to the meal. Anything here is good and the prices are reasonable so you can enjoy your meal without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Went here with in-laws. We had never been here before and had a lot of fun. Our server really made our experience better. I wish I could remember her name because she was awesome. She knew the menu so well and we took forever to order. We had drinks ( my sangria bev was so refreshing) with appetizers, then ordered dinner. At no time did our server make our party feel rushed. We were there for a couple hours having fun eating and drinking with family. Everyone's entrée looked fantastic. I tried the lobster enchiladas and they were wonderful. I had the shrimp app for my entree and it was plenty. My husband had an chimichanga and it was fantastic too. We finished up with a chocolate explosion cake which we all gobbled up.  The place is charming with its theme.  I sure would go back because the menu was huge and I want to try all those New Mexico specialties you just don't see in Arizona. So glad I got introduced to this restaurant."}
{"text":"would come back again, didn't get to eat just had chips & salsa.  Would not get the margarita again.  Good atmaspher"}
{"text":"Decent food with large portions. Prices are a bit high bit you do get enough food. The service has been pretty bad my last two visits. Not sure if it is due to understaffed or just poor training but that's why I gave it three stars verse 4 stars. The green chili stew is a must. It's spicy and hearty. I've had it each time I've been there but had to send it back the last time because it came out cold. Saturday and Sundays they have brunch. The do it yourself bloody mary bar is a fun idea."}
{"text":"This spot was chosen for its ambiance on a chilly night. We celebrated a friend's completing her Masters at ASU.  There were 9 in our party. I was the only who had dined here prior. Our new server Conner and his mentor Natalie were welcoming and accommodating.  The heat lamp was moved to accommodate the opposite side of the cozy fireplace. We requested outdoor seating.  Drink orders were promptly taken and recommendations made.  I always order the chili rellano, slightly crispy, accompanied by black beans and rice.  Everyone was pleased with their order.  Natalie asked us how Conner performed our service.  We were in agreement he earned his wings to serve solo.  As an Az Native, Carlsbad is often a dinner suggestion for visitors.  Best patio, fireplaces and waterfall.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Grey Power Lunch at the Carlsbad.  No Power but lots of Grey for three retired Motorolans who once globe trotted over Europe on Motorola's nickel (Deutsche Mark).  Dos XX's Draft, spinach salads and chicken quesadillas were not in the same ball park as some of the fancy meals in Zurich or Toulouse but the weather was pleasant on the patio.  The water fountains conveniently  drowned out other conversations so we could discuss the pre dot com days and higher MOT stock prices.  A good place to meet every so often plus good food."}
{"text":"So after a most mediocre meal last night I'm still wondering how this place is so positively Yelped? Please don't get me wrong.. CT is a great hang out and is VERY well priced with huge portions but, quality over quantity is a sound rule that for my experience didn't hold true. 

We sat for about 15 minutes before we're even acknowledged by our waiter.. I was so thirsty I almost took my chances and drank from the pool on the patio.. who knows what was in that water but I was SO ready to find out when our waiter showed. Once we got moving the service was decent though one of the entrees was nearly 10 behinds behind the rest. So of course we waited for that entree to come out while ours got cold so we could eat together. Pretty annoying though forgivable I suppose. What wasn't forgivable were the screaming kids that were playing around the pool as their stupid parents sat there and got drunk. How can you enjoy a meal when there are babies crying and children playing.. it seemed like fucking Romper Room instead of a TAVERN! *Sigh* I miss Lambchop!

The food.. eh.. so so. The Pork Adovada sauce was bitter to the point of needing to drown it in sour cream to take the edge off. Me personally would have sent it back but there were other powers that be. The Rotisserie Chicken wasn't better then something you can get at your local grocery, though Id have to say that the groceries are far more moist and flavorful. There were 2 standouts.. Habaero Cheeseburger and the Green Chile Mac 'n Cheese.. both very very tasty! 

We will certainly come back here from time to time but there are other old reliables that make better New Mexican food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I think this place could be better if you do not order take out food from there.  I work about a half mile from this place, which should allow more than enough time to get your food back to work without it being cold when you get there.  This was not the case today.  I am not a fan of cold, soggy french fries.  The fries had the potential to be good but when they are cold and soggy I just can't do it.  The BIGGER issue was the burger I ordered.  This burger was RARE.  I don't eat burgers unless they are well done.  I bit into this burger and the taste was of raw meat.  I went in to the kitchen at work to cook it further and had to cook it through our little oven TWICE to get all the red out of the center of the burger.  There is no excuse in my book for serving someone a burger that has barely touched a grill unless someone specifically orders it that way, and I most certainly did not.  I really don't think I will eat here again but if you do get food here, eat at the restaurant, do not order to go.  You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute place and good food, the green chile Mac was to die for. Would have definitely give this 4 stars but our service was just horrible. It was late night so it was empty, which would make it seem simple to serve us. But I got attitude on several occasions. When I asked about the free chips and salsa for checking in I got eyes rolled at me. And the same when I asked for to go boxes. I don't know maybe he was mad we weren't ordering alcohol? Either way the food was good and the hot sauce was bomb we took two bottles home with us. I would come back but hopefully get a better server!"}
{"text":"The cowboy meatloaf was excellent.  
I asked for the spicy sauce on the side.

The atmosphere is excellent.
 I enjoyed sitting outside."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant/bar in Scottsdale, the staff were super friendly and very attentive.
The food was really good, more hangover/comfort Mexican food in my opinion. I would definitely go back to try something different, not sure if it's the \"best\" quality Mexican food out there but definitely worth the experience here."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and the Carne Adovada Plate is amazing!"}
{"text":"the outdoor seating is great with the waterfall in the background. 
The food was mediocre, while the service was good and outdoor seating great, i would not go back secondary to the quality of the food. 
to note: they serve until 2 am!"}
{"text":"Our friend who used to live here brought us for lunch on a weekend visit, couldn't have picked a more perfect spot. Beautiful patio to enjoy the amazing food and gorgeous weather. Connor was a total sweet heart, so helpful and genuinely personable. Will definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Very unique atmosphere that you wont find anywhere else in Scottsdale. Food is excellent with just the right amount of spice. The staff is very friendly and really helpful if you need some recommendations. The patio waterfall adds a nice ambience and drowns out the traffic noise. It's good to know that you can still get awesome food till 2am."}
{"text":"Enchantment platter! Is great and gives you a taste of everything. Decor is cool too."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time.  I've driven by a number of times but never was able to talk anyone into going with me.  We were out spending a day doing shopping in Scottsdale and drove by on the way home.  I mentioned it to my wife and she agreed to try it.  As we walked in we both exclaimed that this was a really cool little place.  The interior is like a cave and there is running water everywhere which I love.

Our waitress promptly sat us and took our drink order.  Our drinks came back very quickly which was perfect.  We ordered some chips/salsa for an appetizer and a couple of the chicken salads.  The chips and salsa arrived quickly and our drinks were refilled.  The salsa was awesome and the chips had a spice on them.  Most of the items in the restaurant are a little on the spicy side so if you don't like spice your menu selection may be limited.  They may be able to make something less spicy for you too but we didn't ask.  Our drinks were refilled two more times before the salads arrived.  The salads were excellent.  They were huge and had a wonderful flavor.  The chicken in both was very tender with a crisp outside.  

Our drinks never went empty and our waitress was incredibly nice.  This was the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time!  I wish all service was like this.  We ate half of our salads and took the rest along with the remainder of the chips to go.  The waitress talked with us as she boxed up the rest of our meals which was a nice touch.  I even tipped over 20% because I was so impressed by the service.  As we were heading out we were thanked for dining there by a lady at a table (perhaps an owner or manager) which was also nice.

The awesome food, incredibly friendly staff, and decoration of this place will keep us coming back.  I'm glad I finally tried this place and look forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"Excellent Southwestern Food.  As good or better than Richardsons...  I say better!"}
{"text":"I went here with my uncle while visiting Scottsdale. Really good food, nice prices, cool atmosphere. The happy hour had a good selection of Moscow Mules. Good place to go for cocktails, beer, or Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this morning (Sunday) and there were a few things that diminished the experience for me:
* You claim New Mexican grub and then you charge for chips and salsa or sopapillas which are standard complements to any New Mexican restaurant meal.
* At $3, the coffee is  a rip off! Seriously? We're not talking cappuccino, people and you're selling build-your-own Bloody Marys for the same price!
* The carne adovada was tender but not very spicy.

That said:
* The green salsa was really good.
* I'm so desperate for carne adovada, I'll settle. (besides, $9 is more than a fair price for 3 eggs, black beans and carne adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla - even if it was more beans than pork.)
* There are several options for $5; and, if they are all like the eggs benedict, they are generous portions.
* The patio is nice and the bar area feels like a neighborhood pub (not a cave, but that's not got to be a bad thing!)"}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern had been on my bucket list for quite some time
ever since I found out it was New Mexico cuisine
Well you can obvi tell by the name Carlsbad
But I weaseled my way in 
and
I loved it

My favorite thing was the seasoning on the chips and salsa! I tried to ask if they sold bags of the stuff but they didnt. The server was so nice, she offered to pack me 2 to go bags though

The food was great and the chile was nice and spicy

I also had a marg which was pretty tasty

I shall return to CT"}
{"text":"Went this afternoon with about 15 of my co workers. Lots of great food and drinks to go around. I had a chicken salad that was great ! and the assorted dishes around the table all looked fantastic. The service was excellent as was the atmosphere. I will be back with my wife."}
{"text":"In a town littered with strip malls and chains, Carlsbad Tavern is a one-of-a-kind restaurant that blends New Mexican with middle American.  They've got a big menu and a lot of great quirky items--the green chile blue enchiladas are great, the tomatillo machaca chimichanga is heartcloggingly good, and the habenero burger is 5-alarm hot.

The service is not particularly stellar here and their drink prices are steep unless you get there for their late night (past 11pm) menu.  Still, it's a great place that's rarely crowded, the enclosed patio is nice, and the food's wild."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp, we checked in and got free chips and salsa so it pays to be a user. We ordered off the happy hour menu with 2 minutes to spare. This gave us 8 a few minutes to decide what to order since we arrived 10 minutes before happy hour was over. My husband and I ordered the filet tacos and New Mexican Potstickers off the happy hour menu and the Blackened Scallops Special to share.

The scallops were cooked perfectly and the veggies/rice sides were good. The sauce on the scallops made the dish. The beef in the filet tacos was very tender and tasty and three tacos were served with a side of beans. The taco was dressed with guacamole on a very thick flour tortilla.The pot stickers were delicious with a slight teriyaki taste. 

I had traded one of my filet tacos for a shrimp taco ordered by my mother-in-law and had a difficult time determining which was better. I loved both.

The server was busy, yet had time to chat and ensure everything was fine. And, we purchased a Restaurant Arizona card at Costco which discounted the meal by 30% (the $100 gift cards only cost $70 to purchase.)

The parking lot is a bit small but there is valet available. The parking lot is quite active so we found a spot by just waitng a few minutes. We did not have reservations but was immediately seated at one of ghe last available tables outside. 

We sat near a water feature and the babbling water was soothing. There was a wood fireplace and occassional whiffs of smoke would drift by just enough to smell pleasant and not enough to be irritating. We were lucky because the weather was perfect.

I was a bit weary of the bat cave theme i had read about but it turned out to be fine. I would definitely go this restaurant again and now my husband wants to go to New Mexico to visit the real Carlabad Caverns."}
{"text":"I gave this place a final try after my experience last month. I thought maybe it was a fluke, the manager seemed concerned, but no follow up. No big deal, I'm not really anybody important, but I do eat out 5+ times a week and am familiar with good service. 

Needless to say disappointed again. Appetizer did not come until we asked for it when our meals were delivered. We tried waiving the server down more than once. One of the entrees was totally wrong and had to be remade. I was 90% done before he could even eat. 

The moment the error was pointed out the servers super friendly demeanor went sour and zero eye contact was made until the bill came. 

Over it."}
{"text":"Picture this... it's the evening after a long day in the sun, lots of walking, lots of sight-seeing, lots of day-drinking and oh so many Scottsdale sun dresses.  Now it's almost midnight.  You're hungry, but you're also not in any shape to drive.  Well, if you're fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this joint, you're in for a treat.

Right when you get past the parking lot, you feel like you're in line at Disneyland or Universal Studios.  There is running water, fake caverns and bridges taking you everywhere.  Plenty of tvs too but I was focused on one thing, lots of icewater and now it's time to talk about their green salsa (that happens to come for free along with chips and a yelp check in - BOOM).

In my 36 years, I have been partial to red salsa ever since I can remember.  That's only because I hadn't yet tried this one.  It's like the perfect blend of tomatillo, jalapeno and green chiles... best I've ever had.  The waiter even brought out a 2nd tub due to our inhaling it in mere moments.  So good - I can't even explain.  If you ONLY come here for the green salsa and the New Mexican potstickers you are winning at life.

I realize that maybe some of my taste buds were off due to that much day drinking, but I am convinced that whenever anything is the \"best I've ever had\" it's my duty to shout from a rooftop so my fellow friends and yelpers alike can also enjoy.  I don't remember which entree I ordered, and it was too difficult to determine what it was when I finished it off yesterday - but it was also tasty.  I will be back, and will be dreaming of that green salsa until that happens."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for a girls night since I had never been before.  I was a little hesitant since I like more traditional Mexican food but was excited to try.  They do have traditional type Mexican food with a spin on the ingredients.  Cute concept and décor.  The outside was very neat and would be a great place to enjoy Happy Hour when temperatures are a little warmer. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was extremely busy but we were seated promptly and greeted by our server immediately which I thought was great! We ordered chips, salsa, guacamole and drinks.  The salsa's were decent and the guacamole was very good.  I was a little surprised that they charge for the chips and salsa since most Mexican food restaurants do not.  We both ordered off the Green Chile Trail section of the menu.  I had the Green Chile Burrito and my friend had the Blue Corn Enchiladas.  Both were outstanding and portions were large!! We couldn't finish the rice and beans which were good but not the highlight of the entrée.  The flavors were incredible and had just the right amount of heat.  Service continued to be consistent and friendly.  We really did enjoy our experience and look forward to returning soon.  I would defiantly recommend this restaurant for a different experience with Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came into this joint and figured by the ratings, this place would be more than just mediocre. Bummer!

I came in at 11PM and I'm not sure if it was a bad time of day or what but when we walked in...nobody was there to greet us so we just sat in the bar area. Second bummer! This lady was super drunk yelling across the bar and obviously belligerent. The bartender didn't seem to care at all. This lady even spoke about how she was drinking and driving home. Say whattttt? Get a taxi! 

Anyways, food was mediocre as well. Nachos were just chicken, cheese, and meat. No green onion, no tomato, no guac. Give me some colors on my nachos! Service was nothing stupendous either and they charged my friend $3 for a ramekin of a measly scoop of guac. That was our last straw. I will admit their margaritas were killer though. That may have been the reason for my extra star.

Los siento, Carlsbad Tavern!"}
{"text":"Very neat little place. It's themed like a bat cavern named after Carlsbad Cavern. The food us pretty good too."}
{"text":"YUMMY!

I've heard great things about the Tavern and I'm glad I randomly came one night.

At first, while walking in I thought that place was trying to do too much.  Though on second thought, the waterfall and moat was pretty cool.  In case a medieval army decides to attack I guess.  There's a nice little patio to the side, but I chose to sit at the bar to people watch - \"Hungry Eyes\"!

I ordered the Green Chile Burrito and boy was is massive.  However, I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing!  YOU, get in my belly!  Felt like mini-me was in my belly!  ooof!  It was definitely well worth it.  The chile was tasty and the black beans were well spiced.  The shredded beef inside the burrito with the chiles were to die for - mmmmm!  I pounded it down with a few drinks.  Gluttony!  Now I just gotta look our for Kevin Spacey! (SE7EN reference!) 

Service was good, I think the waiter kept pushing drinks on us haha!  Do I look like I need another one!  Well yes, yes I do.  You know what else is pretty cool about this place -- they have pay phone!  What the heck is that!? - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Three of us came in on Saturday October 18 around 1330. We ordered chips and salsa and guacamole. The salsa was too spicy, the guacamole was good. Our Server was nice, but not personable. One of us order the stacked enchiladas, one had a chimichanga and the other other had the blue corn enchiladas. The chicken in the blue corn enchiladas was tough and she only found one shrimp in the other enchilada. The other two plates were not edible due to the spiciness of the sauces. Even before We left the restaurant I felt sick to my stomach. We can all tolerate spiciness, but what we had here was too much. If you are going to serve food this spicy at least give your patrons a warning. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Carlsbad for some time, and finally made it a point to stop in and give it a try.

We came during Happy Hour and managed to do so on their Taco Tuesday, so we did both. First of all, our server was very kind, hospitable, and full of pep. Unlike everyone else, we chose to sit outside in the warm afternoon air and enjoy the scenery (waterfall and desert/cavern decor). As for the food, not bad. Definitely a step up from say, Macayos. The grilled chicken quasadilla was a little dry, but flavorful. The Mexican potstickers were like a party in my mouth. Their street tacos on special were very good, especially the fillet steak taco. 

Yes, there are more authentic Mexican food places in town, but overall, we had a good experience here and would consider visiting again."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem, very close to Old Town Scottsdale the other day. Food was plentiful and very good. We all had the chicken, beef and shrimp tacos along with the tortilla soup. The soup had just a little heat to it but not too much. 
We sat outside on the large patio with a water feature which would be my choice all the time. While walking through the inside it just seemed dark and stuffy but it was 100% packed!  Service was very good. 
If I lived down the street from Carlsbad Tavern my fear is that we'd be there frequently."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great.  The service is fantastic--seriously, I've never had a bad waiter.  The food is really delicious and perfectly spicy.  Favorites to note: Green Chile Stew, Enchantment Platter, Sopapillas, and the Prickly Pear Margarita.  Definitely a favorite spot of mine now."}
{"text":"Not only is this place adorable and makes it awesome to sit outside, the food is delicious and service is great! This was our first time here and Ryan made sure to take great care of us and explained the menu along with all the different spice levels! His suggestions were spot on and the margaritas were to die for! This will definitely be our new New Mexican food spot! Can't wait to come back next time and try something different! Thanks again, Ryan!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the wait staff always seem pissed off. They need to learn how to smile."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions and nice price. We had nachos, a patty melt, and some beers. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Being from New Mexico and missing the food something fierce...made me want to not like this place.  

I have to tell you, it is not like the food back home.  No matter how hard anyone tries...New Mexico is hard to replicate.  

Thanks to Yelp, we got some free chips and salsa.  The red salsa is very chunky and can be difficult to scoop out of the little bowl with the chips...tasty and could use a bit more jalapeño in my opinion....sorry I love hot chile!  There is also a green/tomatillo salsa that is also very yummy!  

I couldn't decide what to try..a green chile cheeseburger or one of their brunch offerings.  As I perused the menu, I noticed that it does have more of the northern New Mexico feel to it rather than the souther NM food I am used to. I opted for the brunch offering.   I can tell you it is very rare to find dishes served with black beans in southern NM, but theirs were tasty...a bit on the salty side.  They were served on the side of the Carlsbad Benedict...a very spicy and unique take on some Eggs Benedict. I opted for them to be served with carne adobada.  Very different from how it is back home, but very tender and spicy nonetheless.  Here, they prepare it as shredded beef marinated and saucy, where I am used to it being more of a steak that is in a drier rub type of seasoning.  Again, I really did enjoy this take on carne adobada.   The eggs were poached perfectly and I absolutely LOVED the jalapeño hollandaise sauce that finished off this dish.  

I wasn't thrilled with the fried potatoes that were served on the side.  They looked and tasted as if they had been sitting there for a while.  Not fresh at all.  

The kicker...in a good way...was the build your own Bloody Mary bar.  For $3.75, I was given a very generous serving of vodka and made my way over to the little table.  There was a wide range of offerings or \"accoutrements\" for your custom bloody mary!  From pickled asparagus, seasoned and marinated jicama (MY FAVORITE), olives, pepperonccinis, pickles, a ton of hot sauces, tomato juice, clamato, V8, and even fresh horseradish!  I'm sure there was more, but I couldn't fit anything else into my glass!  I must say, I make a mean bloody mary!  For the price, you can't go wrong!

I look forward to going back and trying their large menu!  It is a cool place and I'm sure it gets packed during football season for the early opening for the early games...early! ;-)"}
{"text":"I would not recommend Carlsbad Tavern to anyone looking for quality Mexican/New Mexican food. Save your money and your stomach!!!My husband and I came in on an afternoon that this restaurant was not busy but service was still awful. Our waitress walked away before we could finish the end of our orders which in hindsight is probably why my husbands dish was completely wrong. Food was terrible and expensive for what it was. We ordered chips and salsa, the enchantment platter and the adovada burrito plate (we got something other than adovada that resembled boiled mystery beef) The Chile relleno in the enchantment platter was sloppy and flavorless. The chicken in the enchilada was dried and falling apart because of the flour tortilla (enchiladas are typically made with corn tortillas). The salsa and chips was the worst part!!!!! Red \"salsa\" is just tomatoes and red onion (no flavor) and the green salsa just tasted like blended jalapeños and lemon.  I paid $50.00 before tip for 2 entrees, chips and salsa and 2 iced teas. Such a rip off. Please please please go anywhere else."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic southwest atmosphere do not come here. I would compare this to a Joes Crab Shack southwest style.  The decor was very cheesy. While the food was of good quality it was way overpriced. Did I mention it is overpriced? One and done with this place!"}
{"text":"Always good food good service!  Coming here for 10 or so years. My favorite is Turkey wrap w bacon...yummy
But haven't had a bad thing yet"}
{"text":"This actually used to be one of my favorite restaurants until I got pretty nasty food poisoning this last weekend thanks to cold food that I should have sent back. I tried to reach out to the restaurant, and have yet to hear back. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"When we moved to Arizona, Carlsbad Tavern was one of the very first places we tried. And I have never returned. I drive by it from time to time and just wonder how it stays open. As other Yelpers have mentioned: they charge for chips and salsa, and neither are even remarkable (DON'T buy it). I thought the atmosphere was okay and welcoming for a casual place. 

Perhaps it was an off day, but the food and the service were quite poor. We went in for lunch on a Friday, and I had chicken quesadillas because I wasn't too hungry. My date ordered a green chili burrito. The only thing that saves this from being a one star in my mind was that the green chili was really tasty on the burrito. 

I would recommend trying something else in the valley before trying here."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try Carlsbad Tavern out, and I am so happy that I did! The decor was fun for starters. Even the walk into the restaurant was kind of exciting with the running water and the strong cave and New Mexican themes. We got in just before they stop serving dinner (10 PM) and I appreciated that we didn't feel pressured to not to order a meal. They're open until 2 and it sounds like they have a separate late night menu for food. They had some fun sounding mixed drinks too. I tried the prickly pear old fashioned that was super unique and tasty. Not only was the prickly pear a nice twist but it also had Frangelico. All three of us enjoyed our food. I was really impressed with my stacked enchilada. It was super flavorful and filling. I tried my friend's Carne asada NY strip. It was cooked beautifully and was quite tasty. It was spicier than I expected. Our server, Veronica D was attentive, friendly and helpful. She helped make my first experience great"}
{"text":"I really want to like Carlsbad but it's just not making the cut. Let me break it down for you:

The good- this place has a beautiful patio and this time of year is the perfect time to go. They have heat lamps out at night and it's quite comfortable. 
Free chips and salsa when you check in 

The bad- food is just lackluster. The small cup of salsa we ordered had quarter cuts of tomato in it. Everything else is just on the bland side. 
Cocktails are pricy and overly sweet. Also majorly lacking on the alcohol. Take it from the worlds biggest lightweight, I felt nothing after my $9 drink. 

The ugly- the BF and I woke not feeling so hot the next morning. I'll leave it at that :/"}
{"text":"After visiting Carlsbad's tavern last night for the third time ever, I'm updating my review to show our displeasure with this restaurant.  

We were promptly seated on the outside deck for dinner and our server was very quick to greet us. We ordered two skinny margaritas made with casadores, which were really good.  Nice start. We ordered the red chili chimi with a sopapilla for a buck extra,  and meatloaf for our entrees.

 Before the food arrived my husband and I ordered another round of margaritas,  and this is where the night began to go downhill. Mine came out perfect, but I have no idea what the bartenders did to my husband's.  He kept telling me it tasted off. I finally took a sip and almost spit it out; it tasted like flat salty sprite, it was so bizarre.  By the time I had tasted it I figured it was too late to send it back so we just ate the cost and didn't finish the drink. Come to think of it, each time we've visited,  we always are served margaritas that are very inconsistent. 

The food arrived pretty quickly,  which was nice,  but we were soon disappointed again.  Both meals were passable but certainly not great.  My meatloaf had nice taste but the mashed potatoes were so bland and honestly looked like they came straight from the \"instant\" box.  My husband's chimi had very little meat and the rice and beans were nothing special.  Our server forgot our spoapilla as well. 

If we ever come back,  it won't be for a very long time.  There is only so many times that we will settle for inconsistent drinks and mediocre food."}
{"text":"we tried the chimichanga and the enchiladas here. they were both pretty good. the chimichanga was a little spicy but tasty. the chicken and shrimp enchiladas were very good.

the place itself is really nice as the outdoor seating is really pretty and has a mini pond. the inside is suppose to resemble Carlsbad Caverns Cave and is also nicely decorated but can be a little dark.

the parking lot is a litte small though."}
{"text":"Morgan at the bar was awesome. Great service. The best! Will return due to service and great atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"The type of cuisine at Carlsbad is officially considered 'Green Hash Chile New Mexican Style.'  I know this because we asked the bartender as we sat pondering the menu.  This was my first visit to Carlsbad Tavern, and it will not be my last.

I went with a house salad and will agree with Rick S in recommending it with their jalapeno ranch dressing.  Either it was really good or I was really hungry, but I digress!  For my entree, the lobster enchiladas were completely satisfying - especially once they brought out a side of guacamole per my request.  Jared had the carne adovada plate.  (I guess he gets that every f-in time he goes there; i don't think he's ever had anything else!  Guess he likes it!)  No desserts or drinks this visit, but I'm sure we'll be back for more... although the mints on the way out were great!  (And for those curious about the price, our bill was $36 before tip).

We noticed they serve a Sunday Brunch - Bloody Mary Bar as well... sounds good to me; especially once we move to Old Town and won't have to worry about drinking and driving!

Friendly attentive service at the bar, and many more menu items I am excited to try.  Until next visit, Carlsbad Tavern..."}
{"text":"As long as we have lived in AZ , we had never gone to Carlsbad Tavern and decided to check it out last week when we were on way home from doctor's app't in Scottsdale.  It was a pleasant surprise and must say that the wait staff was so friendly and nice.  I got the shrimp with rice rather than beans and it was a bit 'hot' but nothing I was unhappy with.  Good taste!  My husband had the patty melt with fries and he said his was very good also.  I ate some of his fries and they were very tasty.  We would recommend it and will definitely go back. They had a steady clientele so that was a good sign as far as I was concerned."}
{"text":"We had a good time here tonight.  The service was excellent and the food was great too.The music was the best part, New Wave 80's."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this was delicious. I am such a huge fan. The margaritas were probably one of the best I've ever had (and frozen which makes them even better). I loved loved loved the Prickly Pear margarita. My food order was so large that it was nearly impossible to finish even with a little help from my friends. I got the Carne Adovada plate and man was it good. The spiciness level was perfect and just enough to clear the sinuses. The flavor was full and complex. The rice and beans were solid (this is usually my indicator of good Mexican cuisine) but not anything so delicious that I felt compelled to eat them all.
The decorations were really cool and I liked how the menu was like a newspaper. I loved the outdoor fountain and sitting next to it under an umbrella on a hot Arizona day was close to paradise for the hour and a half we were there."}
{"text":"I drive past Carlsbad every night on my way to work, so after check their menu online I decided to stop on my way back from picking up my paycheck.
I decided to have the habañero cheeseburger cooked rare, it came with fries and a salad.
It was tasty but could have been cooked a little less, it arrived more on the medium than rare, it's all good though, it tasted good. It wasn't too spicy. It had chopped habañeros in it and was topped with jalapeño cheese, lettuce, onion, and tomato. I would've liked a little more heat to it though.
The fries were cooked well and I didn't try the salad as I was getting full off of the burger.
The service was excellent and friendly.
I will go again, next time I'll just make sure the burger is a little more rare ;)"}
{"text":"Every once in a while you come upon a restaurant that has it all. Well this gem in Scottsdale Arizona is just that place. 
   First of all Carlsbad Taverns has a sizable parking lot, however, it can fill up quickly because this place is so popular. They have solved this by offering free valet parking. 
   Just walking from the parking lot to the main entrance is an experience. This restaurant has maintained a beautiful green lawn area with palm trees present that draws you to the main entrance. The entrance appears to be made out of  adobe. There is a large brightly painted Archway with the name of the restaurant and a simple sign saying \"New Mexican Grub\".  
  Walking through the archway into the restaurant itself is jaw dropping. You are welcomed by a 30 foot waterfall which which drops into a beautiful little lake. While you're taking all of this beauty in you can see other customers down below seated around this lake enjoying their meals. But that's only the beginning, as you have to walk into the inside dining area which to me re-created the experience of walking into the actual Carlsbad Caverns. As your eyes  adjust from the bright Arizona sunlight to the dimly lit inside dining room you see many separate dining rooms and just a myriad of unique decorations adorning the walls. It's something to be seen especially if you love New Mexico and the Carlsbad Caverns.
   You can now exit to the outside seating area which is just as beautiful as can be. There are so many small touches such as the bat built into the fireplace. The more you look around the more you'll see. But overall the ambience is just incredible and I'll just leave it at that.
   Our waitress was just incredibly friendly and as I looked around I saw this restaurants customer service was just impeccable for all.  Taking our drinks and food order was all done with a smile. The menu itself is unique because it is a newspaper (The Daily Guano) complete with headlines and news on the front page.  Once you look at the menu you can see that it is wide ranging and just like reading the newspaper you can take your time and find what you want to order.
   But what good is all of the above if the food if sub standard? Well no worries here because everything served was well plated, visually unique and delicious. As the saying goes, \"you know quality when you see it\". 
   I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant and I highly recommend it to all."}
{"text":"It breaks my heart to have to write this review of a restaurant that used to be one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale. 

Today we were having a Sunday brunch for my bestie who lives in Texas. I had fond memories of the food, and especially the sopapillas. We arrived at noon, it wasn't terribly busy, so we sat outside on the patio. 

First off, we ordered margaritas and several others decided on the bloody mary bar. The margaritas were gross, salty and sour w/ limes that were long past their prime. The bloody mary drinkers were made to wait...and wait...and wait for their glasses to walk inside to make their drinks. 

We ordered our entrees at about 12:30-12:45 and didn't get them until after 1:30. When I received my carne adovada burrito, it had been nuked beyond recognition, the rice was shriveled and was burnt onto the plate, as were the black beans. My first bite of the burrito was a hunk of fat...that pretty much ended it for me, also, the sopapilla I ordered for the dish came out 20 minutes later after I reminded him. The sopapilla was not at all like I remembered, and was more of a flattened piece of naan than anything else.  

The rest of my party had varying issues with their meals. To add insult to injury, my lunch cost $55 for one gross burrito, 2 drinks and a piece of bread pudding due to whatever gratuity they added. The waiter was surly...when he was present at all, which was rare. No water refill, completely unapologetic for the various issues with our experience, and never took away the offensive margaritas he served in the beginning. 

Needless to say, we will not be returning. What the hell happened to this place??! ugh! BUMMER!!!"}
{"text":"Well known with some, but strangely still a well-kept secret from many . . . you gotta try them out. Food is a unique alternative to all the other Southwestern-theme restaurants. Additionally, these guys are a class act. I was having some issues with my bank and debit card. Andrew, the owner, went the extra mile when he didn't need to. Great happy hour specials. Love the Pozole, cheese crisp, NY Carne Asada. It's hard not to order the green chile stew every time, though, but I want to try a lot of other items. Nice atmosphere and outdoor seating is perfect in the evenings."}
{"text":"Urggg, I hate it when I'm conflicted with being nice, especially when one of my friends knows the staff and owners, and being truthful, but I'm just not feeling Carlsbad Tavern enough to go more than 3/5 Stars. 

I want to though, so I'm not writing this establishment off forever.

Screw it, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and change it. I'll add the extra star. Whatever. 4/5 Stars.

CARLSBAD TAVERN

Carlsbad Tavern was established in 1995. The New Mexican Bat Cave theme started at the original location on Scottsdale Road and Osborn with bats, Mexican Movie Posters and Roswell memorabilia.

However, upon the move to Hayden & Osborn in the Spring of 1998, the Bat Cave theme took on a new shape with the creation of the Guano Canal with a waterfall on the patio and the main dining room becoming The Bat Cave with a fountain.

After 11 years of adding to the décor, Carlsbad has been transformed into a place all ages can be comfortable in a multitude of different environments to suit the whole family.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

My girlfriend and I had just been to Postino Highland, which I love and previously reviewed (4/5 Stars) and we were supposed to meet some friends at Carlsbad Tavern.

When I arrived, I immediately fell in love with the entrance. I love the dramatic waterfall-moat thingy; it's very pretty.

The inside was dark, like too dark. It was hard to see what was going on, and it was mostly empty, with a few regulars at the bar. I guess that makes sense, since they call it \"The Batcave.\"

Like I said, my girlfriend knows the bartenders, and she ordered the drinks. I have no complaints about the service at all. Everyone was very friendly.

CONCLUSION

I'm not throwing in the towel to Carlsbad Tavern, it just didn't live up to the fun exterior and all the hype.

4/5 RECOMMEND 

OF NOTE

*Plenty of parking out front. Valet available.

{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern has been a favorite for many years but this was my first trip in a while. The Osso Bucco continues to be a special dish and the veggie enchiladas had good flavor. Drinks from the bar were well made. The bartender was friendly and chatted us up while we waited to be seated. We ate on the deck just outside the bar which offered a good view of what turned out to be a spectacular sunset. I definitely feel like I got a good value and so will continue to come back. I only award five stars to truly one-of-a-kind restaurants. This falls just short of that but certainly does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Omg Carlsbad Tavern is awesome!!!  We went for happy hour and had amazing drinks and amazing appetizer of filet mignon tacos plus entree of lobster enchiladas. Everything was great the outside patio the drinks, service and food!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Carlsbad Tavern on Friday night, and I have to start off by saying that the service and scenery were fantastic. Cozy, with music a little loud but not overly so, a lovely outside and a comfortable inside. The service was great - never had to wait on a refill, drinks were kept topped off and ready. The portions were generous, and nobody was at risk of leaving hungry.

We started with the nachos, which were great. Excellent chips, good toppings, well balanced; out of six of us, five ordered the tacos for the entree and all but one really liked them. I ordered the habanero sliders, and they were...pretty alright? They were a little dry, but there was plenty of fresh pepper cooked into the beef, and a reasonable spice. I also apparently misread the menu, as I thought it was served with ghost pepper cheese and fries, not ghost pepper cheese fries. Those were, unfortunately, lacking.

The texture of the fries was fantastic, top notch potato, but the actual ghost pepper cheese just...barely existed at all. Turns out it was more of a powder added to the fries - the cheese flavor was good, in all fairness, but there wasn't a hint of pepper to them. I know they have to take it a little easy on the ghost pepper since most people can't handle it, but I at least expected some of that wonderful smokeyness that ghost pepper carries and for the heat to be at least close to the habanero burger's. In this case, it might as well have just been cheddar fries - perfectly good, but not what I was expecting.

The happy hour deals were solid; if you enjoy spice and are in the area, Carlsbad Tavern is a good choice (and the tacos came well recommended), but I don't think I'd go out of the way for it, either."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  The BF and I stopped in for Happy Hour, and ended up staying for dinner.  Really cute place....great decor!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Good margaritas, good chips and salsa.  I checked in and tried to use the free chips and salsa check in offer, but our server said since it was our first time in, chips and salsa were complimentary!  Great food too!  All in all, great experience and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am from NM and this place brings me home. The enchantment platter is unreal, also love the green chile stew, the sopapillas w/ honey. Osso Bucco is great. It's not officially \"mexican\" food, it's \"NEW\" Mexican food, but take my advice, next time you have what you think is a yearning for \"mexican\" food, just head straight over to this place instead. Great patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Veronica was an awesome waitress! Food was great. Watch out for hot sauces. Always ask!
Best chipotle mayo sauce! 
Had the platter a huge portions.
We also had the chocolate bread pudding.....
The best I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and casual. Waiter was quick, efficient and friendly. I enjoyed the meatloaf and mixed veggies. Delicious!!!!
We'd definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Carlsbad is always great! Really nice environment nd great happy hour. Krista was our server and she was the best! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Been there twice w/the hubs. Awesome patio! First class service 
Missed Brunch last time, regular menu was great anyway. Made it this time, yaay!! Awesome house made chips & salsa (red's too spicy for me, hubs loves it! I always scarf down the green.) He got Huevos Rancheros, proclaimed perfection. I got Benedict w/Canadian Bacon - verified perfection! I'd like to see a few more additions on the \"Make-It-Yourself Bloody Mary\" Bar, but still good enough to keep the rating  Spicy, delicious food w/good selections. Would love to see the Weekend Brunch go a little later - 2:00 maybe? We're fans!"}
{"text":"It was good and very much like New New Mexican food.  I had the blue corn chicken enchilada plate which is my favorite in Albuquerque and it was very very good.  Smothered in Red and green (Christmas), and it was good chili. I would go there again."}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place gets such praise.  Being from New Mexico, let me point out that this is NOT New Mexican cuisine.  

Secondly, who ever heard of getting charged over a dollar for a diced jalapeno when you had \"NACHOS\" (or rather chips, beans and cheese) for lunch.  Jalapenos should definitely be included on nachos.   

Service was horrible and very slow.  I spilled my ice tea and used my napkin to clean it up.  When I informed our server, she replied \"you're okay\". I had to use the wet napkin because she didn't even bother to bring me another.   

Lastly, my friend noticed a huge cockroach crawling under our table which I unfortunately stepped on.  This was a big black sewer cockroach, so you know the end result and it was disgusting.  

This was my second time there, and it will be my last."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out. Having lived in AZ off and on for 8 years, the time had come. I had reserved in advance and our table was out on the patio, as the reservationist had recommended as the temp dropped to the 80's. For our table there was one umbrella and the sun, if directly on you was hot! We had to gather umbrellas and position them ourselves..it was quite a comotion. Our server even saw this and didnt even offer to assist!

The server, didnt seem to care about the service, after all the 18% was already included.  It took forever to get our drink orders and even longer if we wanted to partake in the bloody Mary Bar.. because he had to bring us glasses.

The Bloody Mary Bar, was on a teeny tiny filthy table next to the bar...the garnishes were extinct, the table was dripping various ingredients. It looked like the remnants of a rager the night before. One of my friends asked for an olive, since none were provided and the bartender (who wasn't busy) rolled her eyes and scoffed! WTF?

I have to say the food was good.. at least the lobster croissant was but it wasn't worth coming back with all things considered,"}
{"text":"Service was great, always there to fill up an empty glass and checked on us several times.  The patio area has a nice ambiance even during the day.  Awesome blue corn enchiladas! Margaritas were yummy :)  The green salsa is amazing! I usually go for red, but this time the New Mexico flare caught my attention!
We used the check-in offer for the free chips and salsa without any issues. The servers were patient with us...we were so busy chatting away, that we took forever to finally order.  I didn't notice any smell that other reviewers mentioned. I also felt that it was a nice change from the high end chains you usually find these days. Chill place with good food and decent pricing!  My jalapeno margarita was only $4.50 - a special of the day!"}
{"text":"I'm marking 4 stars because the ambiance is so darn cute! Their outdoor area is completely decked out with string lights, a lagoon, murals on the walls and just a bunch of decor all over that sets a cool tone for hanging out. They offer some interesting cocktails - I enjoyed the prickly pear rita myself. 

We didn't eat there other than one app and some chips and salsa so I can't recommend much on the food yet. However we had their New Mexican Potstickers and they were pretty good. Chips were fresh and salsas were tasty.

They have a long happy hour from 2pm to 6pm daily and serve till 2am daily so I'm guessing it would be a fun place to meet up with friends and hang out!  I'll let you know more about the food the next time I'm in town..."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner, be ready for a good kick! Margaritas were great too"}
{"text":"Love this bar. The thing about Carlsbad is that there is always interesting people at the bar and the bartender, Darryl is a great host. He's quick with a drink and wit and he is great at what he does. The food is yummy. My favorite thing on the menu is chicken nachos."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the food was wonderful! I will be back for the food. Now the reason for my 3 stars comes down to the service. Our waiter was slow and didn't seem to honestly care. We waited for about 10 minutes for a to go box. We would also barely see him so we were always out of drinks. That's my only complaint so other then that, great place for some spicy food!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Really enjoyed my The JP Morgan mule, also had for an appetizer the New Mexican potstickers with a great creamy corn sauce, a must have, and I got the stacked enchiladas as an entree an they were amazing, a little kick to the sauce but excellent and a big portion enough to make two meals out of it. 
The service was superb, sat at the bar and Tyler was very helpful. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, green chili machaca burrito, ordered delivery through Grubhub, food was still hot when it arrived, just missing the silverware, but other than that, it was great and will definitely reorder again in the near future."}
{"text":"Opened by a former part-owner of Richardson's, Carlsbad Tavern is one place in the valley I keep coming back to.  It used to be on the corner of Scottsdale Road and Osborne...moving to Hayden (just south of Osborne) about 6 years ago. 

With inventive New Mexican entrees, Carlsbad Tavern provides both great atmosphere and eats! 

It's steaks, ribs, and burgers are grilled over pecan wood, adding a smokiness that's a nice alternative to hickory or mesquite. It's carne adovada rivals both Richardson's and Los Dos Molinos (though less spicy than Los Dos.) Start off with the Tequila shrimp, served with cilantro pesto black beans (to die for!) Chicken tortilla soup also rocks my world...Chili rellenos are among the best I've had in Phoenix. Ribs are way up there also. The sauce is unique, flavorful, and works perfectly with the meat. Don't forget the corn muffins with cactus butter! 

Well stocked bar with a friendly competent staff. They also have one of the funnier menus around called...\"The Daily Guano\"

Much more seating here than Richardson's. What really sets it apart is the tables outside. All heated, for comfort any time of year. Add to that a creek and a fireplace...and you get a restaurant that works for lunch after golf or a on date."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for springtime brunch!

We love it here!

Elizabeth is the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Extremely  bland! So generic! We ordered the stew and it was mushy. No moisture whatsoever, very thick and hard to eat .Needs broth or something!!then had enchiladas, a flavorless red chili sauce and an overcooked egg. Was charged 3 x asking f9r more chili to put on top of everything so I could eat it. wanted to love it, but I won't be back.i get so mad because restaurants have to accommodate their customers.  If you do not like spicy food, you have no business eating chile! Sad to see that there's nothing flavorful because of those people who complain about 'spicy'-go to taco bell karen"}
{"text":"Being originally from New Mexico, I always love my green chili! Have bags frozen in the freezer cause I thought I would never find a place that would serve it here in the Tempe Scottsdale area! When I heard about this place, I knew I had to try it out! 

I like the theme of Carlsbad! There menus are original and fun. The servers are EXTREMELY friendly and I was seated promptly, it was a group of 7. I ordered the green chili burger, it's an opens faced burger drenched in green chili. I have to say that it was awesome! The green chili was the perfect amount of hot! Then for desert I had the chocolate bread pudding! It was pretty good, very chocolaty, just wish there was some more sauce on it or something, seemed to be a little dry. But overall, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a recommendation from a friend.  It wasn't bad...but I wasn't all that impressed myself.  The place is cool looking...loks like it could have a cool atmosphere.  Personally though...wasn't all that thrilled. 

The Good:  Cool looking place. 

The Meh:  Maybe it's just because I discovered I'm not a Green Chili fan...or maybe a fan of the way they do it.  I got the Blue Corn Enchiladas.  Just seemed like it was more spicy than flavorful.  The rice was good.  Black beans were tasty (and I'm not a bean fan).  The enchiladas though...didn't seem like they had anything done to them.  Meet wrapped in the tortilla (didn't even notice if the shrimp one had anything in it).  At least it was all slathered in chili and cheese...  I'd give it another shot though but I would try something else off a different section of the menu.  Plus...pricey.  Yeah..it was a decent amount of food...but $11 for a couple enchiladas seems excessive.  

The Bad: I don't know...maybe I should've stood up and waved my hands around...but just seemed like I didn't really get much in the way of service.  Yes...I sat at the bar...but it seemed like others were getting attention (regulars perhaps?).  Took awhile before interest was shown to take my order...then awhile again after I was finished to get the bill.

Overall:  Cool looking place, kinda pricey.  Service, meh.  Food items, not bad.  I'll rate again if/when go again and try something different."}
{"text":"Calrsbad Tavern was good. I'd heard a lot about it before going, so my expectations were high. The food was a little pricier than I think it was worth. I did enjoy the multiple salsas they offer with the chips in salsa (thanks for the check-in offer on yelp). I had the combo (enchilada, chile, and burrito) so I could get a good variety. The food had good flavor, but there wasn't anything very special about the dish."}
{"text":"We've come her a few times and usually enjoy what we order, especially if you like spicy foods.  My boyfriend ordered the Habenero burger which he really enjoyed I ordered the skewers, very healthy and a good choice if you are debating. I have also had the tacos, they were spicy but pretty tasty. The service is usually pretty good and attentive. They usually are helpful with suggestions if you are debating on what to order. If you check in on yelp, you get chips and salsa. The chips have a great flavor. I will be back, I like this place."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this bar a try one night in Scottsdale.  It was one of a few that were open late on a mid-week night and looked appealing.  The restaurant/bar looks like it can be hopping on busy nights, but on this particular night (Wed), it was slow.

I saddled up to the bar and asked for a menu.  I asked the bartender if they had any IPA's and he suggested the Odell brewing company IPA.  I went for it and asked him what he would recommend I try.  Since  it was considered 'late night', there was a special menu and he suggested the Pork Loin Sliders (3 Sliders with Pepper Jack, Poblano Serrano Mayonnaise, and Tortilla Encrusted Onion Rings).  It sounded awesome, so I went with it.

The IPA was really tasty and hit the spot.  After a few minutes, the Pork Loin Sliders came out.  I spread the Poblano Serrano Mayo on them and then for fun added some Fries on the Sliders.  I took a small bite out of the first Slider and it was awesome!  The Pork Loin was moist & juicy and the Poblano Serrano Mayo was the perfect compliment....adding a nice bite to the flavor.  I devoured the Sliders within a few minutes and then sat back and enjoyed the rest of my IPA.

I really enjoyed this place and would like to return on my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is a great example of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" From the outside I thought this was some fancy smancy high class place, but once inside I was transported to a pace that had more of a pub vibe, with woodwork, dark interior and menus on newspapers. 

Our server was prompt and attentive but she was of the old school diner waitress type...all business, no smile but gets it done! We never had to ask for beverage refills because she was two steps ahead. 

My friend and I are both gluten free and after a recommendation from the aforementioned waitress we opted for two of the tex-mex specialities; the blue corn enchiladas and the stacked enchiladas. Food was delivered fast and we also got free chips and two types of salsa for checking in on Yelp (sweet!).  We both enjoyed our meals thoroughly. The food was tasty, piping hot, and portions were large enough for a doggy bag. Just beware that the plates the entrees are served on we're scorching hot! I mean like burn your fingers hot, they really should do something about that because it could be a safety issue. 

So everything was fabulous except the random drunk man. Several times while trying to enjoy our meal this drunk patron stumbled over to our table and blew kisses, winked, stared mumbled some nonsense, and very loudly belched at us. On his last trip over he actually sat down at our both on top of my friends take-out box! Not our waitress but another server saw this go down and apologized and made him leave. She told us he had been doing this all night to various other customers. Ok, so here's the deal. Great that you handled it BUT why did it get this far??? Why did the bartender (who only had two other patrons) keep serving this man? Why didn't anyone call him a cab? Why didn't the manger intervene? Why did this poor girl have to be the one to deal with his drunkeness? So, while the food and service were both great that man did impede on our evening to the point we were worried about leaving for fear he was roaming the parking lot, luckily he wasn't."}
{"text":"Been around the corner from this place for a couple years, guess it's about time my batwings brought me in...

A good mix of happy hours specials from appetizers to salads. From spicy potstickers to salads, they've got a lot of variety. The drink special I got down with was the Tres Agave Margarita. (I know, quelle horreuer on the missing Malibu, but sometimes you've gotta try the specialties). 

The drink I asked for was on the rocks, lotsa salt. And boy, did they make it like I ordered it. It was good, not as good as a certain favorite margarita place of mine, but I'd give it a 4 star on a 5-star scale. 

Service was friendly and spot on. No empty glasses or dying for a drink around here. Guess the bat cave bartenders have some good drink radar going on. 

The food was average. Nothing spectacular. But it didn't repulse me or remind me of stuff I used to make in home ec class. So that's a plus. 

They did have Malibu behind the bar so when I return, I'll go back to my usual. Don't know if they use a pineapple gun or the cans. That may sway me into sticking with the margaritas :P"}
{"text":"The owner, or manager?, not sure.. Was AMAZING to our family during sunday brunch. Accommodating beyond the norm and beyond expectations. I went to UNLV for hospitality management, and can say that he and the waitress were superb. The waitress  was awesome and funny and personable and intuitive when it came to our needs. We live in walking distance... And thankful that we found our new brunch spot!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food Allergies Beware!   I would have posted this review much sooner after eating there, but it took me a while to get around to it. Why you ask?  Because I had a severe allergic reaction from not one, not two, but three different dishes that I was told would be fine for me.  I have a severe tomato allergy.  I know, I know.  It's not the best idea to go to a Mexican place when you have tomato allergies but my wife loves Mexican so I went.  We opted to go for several appetizers instead of entrees so we could have a little bit of everything.  We chose a chicken quesadilla, chicken nachos, and shrimp tacos.  I told the waitress I was allergic to tomatoes and asked if tomatoes were in any of the items.  She replied no.  When the food came out of the kitchen it looked great.  I bit into the quesadilla and BAM! tomatoes!    We promptly sent it back to be remade.  Then I bit into the shrimp taco, and you guessed it.  Tomato!   Finally, the nachos also had tomatoes on top.   When the waitress returned, I was informed that they cannot make a chicken quesadilla (or nachos) without tomatoes because they are actually cooked in tomatoes.  The shrimp was also cooked in tomatoes.   I was in the process of having an allergic reaction.  I could barely speak, I couldn't breathe, and I was experiencing a massive headache.  We just asked for the check and left.    When the check arrived, of course, the waitress billed us for everything that I couldn't possibly eat because she was too inept at her job to learn the menu, or even ask a chef about specific allergies.  I'm not a big fan of being ensured three different times that I can eat something, it arriving completely full of what I'm allergic to, then being expected to pay for it.  If you have any allergies to anything, don't go here."}
{"text":"My enchiladas were great, drinks solid, experience diminished by a non attentive waiter.  Manager took care of us the rest of the evening, Art was the strength of the establishment"}
{"text":"Oh my! Get the Green Chile Burrito with Carne Adobada!!! The heat was fantastic and SO tasty!  David, our waiter was great.  He has happy eyes!  My new favorite place"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat and loved it. The Carne Advoada is very tasty and worth it. The Green Chili Philly was very messy and worth rewashing my shirt...excellent joint! Stop on in, You'll love it."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!! 

The only vegetarian entree was an enchilada and if you don't want that you're SOL. They have signature street tacos which are customizeable but ONLY with meat. I asked the server if I could simply sub in vegetables and he went back to the kitchen to ask. He came back and said that I could, for a \"ridiculous upcharge\" and that I was better off not doing it. Instead I ordered the street tacos with no meat and a side of their vegetables and it was just terrible. 
It's 2018. Not all people eat meat. Get with the times."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant with delicious food and amazing outdoor seating. The staff was really friendly as well. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I recommend this place. Nice patio. Price is right. I like the carne adovada."}
{"text":"It took a lot of convincing, but we were able to talk the whole MSBL team into going here for dinner one night during the tournament. They complained up a storm about how it was 20 minutes away from where we were staying and some said they just wanted to lay around and do nothing. But, I just stood my ground and told them how great this place was and that they would like it. We made a reservation for 9 for the outside area. The guys were all late, figures. But they had a table for us and it was a gorgeous evening. They guys all got steaks, burgers, southwestern inspired dishes, etc. They ate like they had played all day in the sun. Ok, maybe they earned it. 

And after it all, they thanked me. They all loved it. The food was just as good. The outside setting was far better than inside the first time, and our servers kept up with this roudy crew."}
{"text":"This place is not clean, the smell of rancid meat hung in the air. I waited for my server for 20 minutes she still did not return. I went to the bar to order drinks for my table.
  When my food arrived it was several pieces of crumpled meat on some withered lettuce. Definitely not prime rib. 
 Then my credit card was charged  Twice!
 I want my money back."}
{"text":"Hannah was a great server. Made sure to give us all our options but not pressure us. 

The fried ice cream is bomb. Hatch Chili I ridiculous. Chip y salsa to live for. Mac & cheese has peppers in it or chicken. 

Great place for a late beer. Very homey. 

Awesome outside vibe and inside vibe."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at Carlsbad Tavern this past Saturday night and it was so delightful. Food was amazing.  Just the right heat (spice) for me and the much spicier for my husband. The ambiance in the restaurant is great. Staff are helpful and very attentive to your needs. Even had a fabulous peach dessert. Would highly recommend this for a nice dinner. Quite the place.  We'll definitely be going here more often. There is booth seating as well as outside seating.  An other area for larger groups too. Can't wait for cooler weather to go back and sit outside.  The even have a Pokémon gym there called the Bat Hole.  Good for all ages."}
{"text":"We were able to watch the sunset by sitting on the upper deck.  This extra perk was a great addition to our dinner.  I had the salad with jalapeno bacon and chicken, can't remember the name, but it was excellent.  My husband had the meatloaf.  

Our service was excellent and pleasant.  The little stream isn't the greatest, but the little fountains make a pleasant sound.  Great restaurant for the price and amount of food."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite local spots! Every time we have been here we've tried something different (they have a great menu with a ton of variety) and have loved it. The staff is extremely friendly and the service is fast! One of our favorite things is the atmosphere: awesome bar area, even better outdoor patio and outdoor seating, and an overall eclectic vibe that is great for a fun date night, family meal, or to catch a sports game. Definitely a great restaurant to try!"}
{"text":"Food was nothing special.  everyone I went with didn't enjoy their meal. The service was slow with refills and the restaurant was not busy. Wouldn't recommend going here. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Service was beyond sub-par. We engaged in a late lunch/early happy hour and it took quite awhile for us to even be acknowledged, let alone be served. Food and drink?...GREAT. I get...bartender wanting entire bar, but not worth it in comparison to good service."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. 

Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. 

Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of \"Dusk Till Dawn\". 

We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? 
We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. 

Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) 
There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.

For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. 
There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. 

My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.

I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things."}
{"text":"Poor service. The host was incredibly rude. Don't go there for a special occasion because they state they don't do anything for a special celebration.... \"not even a candle\" what we were told"}
{"text":"Place is super cool! Our server Lottie was awesome! She has great drink suggestions. Worth checking out for sure if you like hot food!"}
{"text":"Finally tried you guys last week. Won't go back though. Wanted to watch the only NBA playoff game at the bar but, 3 TV's were on hockey and someone was watching golf ( played 10 hours ago and was taped). Did not honor the yelp check in nachos until the third request and, couldn't get my easy drink order right or fill our water glasses.  You need some serious staff training. Food is good and nice venue."}
{"text":"After spending over 4 hours buying a new car on MacDowell, my husband and I were starving and ready for a nice big drink!  He had the idea to backtrack to Carlsbad Tavern; the perfect spot to unwind, relax and enjoy some great food.
We sat at the bar (late afternoon and the place was pretty empty) and the bartender was delightful! Also, a couple of the servers were off duty and sat down to chat. We enjoyed the banter and the obvious friendship and felt priviledged to be included! 
They have a nice happy hour menu (early 'bat' specials, ha ha)  with appetizers and drink specials. But we went straight for the blue corn enchiladas (one chicken and one shrimp is how they come, but you can have them other ways) on their regular menu. Delicious! And the margaritas are really good...tart with lots of lime, not like those extra sweet ones you sometimes get in Mexican restaurants. The menu includes other New Mexican specialties and burgers that are supposed to be out of this world. 
We inhaled our food (and a couple margaritas!) and felt so much better driving home in the new car!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, casual place.  I had the carne adovado which was good but not as good as I was led to believe based on the reviews I read.  Chips were really good, salsa and guac was ok."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.  We chose to sit outside where it was cool and isolated from the rest of Scottsdale, although the inside looked cozy and inviting.

Our service was great as well, unobtrusive yet on the ball.  Our iced teas were refilled quickly and our waitress always seemed to be right there when we needed her without hovering.

But the food wasn't that impressive.  It wasn't bad, and I probably made a bad menu choice: I ordered a steak at a place specializing in New Mexican cuisine.  For $21 I expected a steak of a bit higher quality than what I received.  It was difficult to cut and had none of the grilled flavor that I was anticipating, but it was smothered in a decent creamy peppercorn-laden sauce.  However, the mashed potatoes and veggies were great. The potatoes were loosely mashed with good amount of spice added that was noticeable but not overwhelming.  The veggies were a nice variety and not overcooked.

Again, the food wasn't bad, but not as good as I was expecting for the price.  I would go back for one of the menu items that is more in line for a restaurant specializing in New Mexican cuisine, but I'll go elsewhere when I've got a hankerin' for a good steak."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been coming here fairly regularly for about a year.  The food is always great and the service is spot on.  My two favourite dishes are the Carne Adovada plate and Ruben's Chicken-fried Chicken.  The food definitely is New Mexico style and has a good kick to it, so be prepared for some spice."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Phoenix of old, as in 15 years ago.  Campy but fun.  Beginning with the name which is a pun on Carlsbad Cavern and the bat motif, complete with a corny yet fun newsletter you'll find on your table.  

The food is awesome.  Don't know of any New Mexican that compares either in Phoenix or Tucson.  The carne adovada is out of sight.  Portions are large at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I basically live across the street from Carlsbad, and have always had a weird vibe from it.  Why?  good question.  I was basically judging a book by it's cover, which is so stupid because this place is AWESOME!  First of all, you have to sit outside.  Their outdoor area is fantastic and doesn't make you feel like Hayden Rd. is on the other side of the rock wall.  I really wanted some Mexican-style food, which is why my boyfriend and I went to Carlsbad in the first place.  We saw the habenero burger and quickly changed our minds to challenge the heat of the burger.  We also got a side of the green chile mac, which complemented the spiciness quite well.  The burger has a warning saying \"you buy it, you own it,\" and although I thought the burger was excellent, I didn't think it was all that hot or scary.  Don't get me wrong, it was definitely hot, but nothing the average heat-lover couldn't handle.  I love it when you find a place that has so many things you want to try, and Carlsbad is one of them.  I am looking forward to going back and getting something new, oh and having another one of their house margs which are also great!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service. Natalie was perfect. I described a beer I like and she recommended Modus.  Right on target. We ate outside and we were fortunate the weather was very nice. The green chili sauce is spicy so it's not for the novice."}
{"text":"Summary: Neat place, ok food, good service. The food was just ok (not our favorite New Mexican and could've been more flavorful), but you get a lot of it. We gave it average ratings for the cool outdoor patio space. Will be coming back when it's cooler for drinks and apps on the patio."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't been here more often, that will change...great food, great service and extremely clean bathrooms...I'm impressed and will be back"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a couple friends here and Carlsbad Tavern is quickly becoming our go to lunch spot in Scottsdale . Their patio outside is among the best in the area that includes a gorgeous river like fountain running along the building . There are also some fireplaces and a surrounding wall structure decorated with Mexican style furnishings and art that  gives a feeling of peaceful seclusion from the busy streets just outside.   

 Before I mention the food I have to give a shoutout to the service . Our waitress Stephanie was a rockstar .  She was so friendly and professional. Our drinks were never empty and she answered every question about the menu we had without hesitation,  if she's available I would recommend sitting in her section if possible . 

We have had the pot stickers before which are my favorite appetizer. They come with a sweet cream sauce covering the plate that I could drink in the form of a milk shake . It's ridiculously good so if you haven't ordered this dish I highly suggest it . I also loved the filet tacos with black beans . The steak is so tender and the accompanying black beans are among the best I've had . There's a depth of spice and flavor in the black beans that makes you not put the spoon down . I finally manned up and ordered the Habanero burger this visit . This burger had been featured on the food network at some point for its fiery habanero blended beef and accompanying pepper infused fixings . I feel if I describe it I will ruin the suspense of going into the unknown with your burger venture so I'll just say this . Eat the pepper that comes on top to fully experience it and Order a glass of milk BEFORE . It was delicious ."}
{"text":"The food, and the bartender Daryl,  were amazing.  If you like a green chili and spicy, this is your place!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was money! I can't believe I've been in the area for years without ever discovering this gem. 

Let's start by saying Cara is an amazing bartender and server. Hey level of service was outstanding and second to none. I would come back even if the food wasn't amazing.... Which it was. 

The food was phenomenal. The nachos were outstanding and fully loaded. Enough for two people for sure. We also had the enchanted plater as well. 

If you haven't been don't waste anymore time and come check this place out."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  All around a 5 Star place.  The service was amazing and very quick.  Mexican potstickers are a must have for an appetizer.  Also the red Chile chimichanga and blue corn enchiladas were delicious.  I will definitely come back..maybe even tomorrow."}
{"text":"I really wanted to only give this restaurant a half star, but Yelp does not allow that. To begin, I don't even know how this place has 4 stars and falls under \"Mexican food.\" I arrived at this place under the false pretense  that I could get some decent Mexican food. How wrong I was. First, I thought we would receive chips and salsa when the water came out, but I was wrong that would be at an additional $3. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with red sauce. While you would think this would be an easy ask it seemed to be very difficult to do. While the server was very nice in getting this done the burrito was HORRIBLE! The beans tasted as if they were thrown from the can to the stove for about 2 min and then out to us. The rice was crunchy and did not taste like regular spanish rice. Needless to say I will not be back for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I live right next door and thought I would try it out. Got the blue corn enchiladas, there was no sauce so the chicken was dry. Asked if the chicken was shredded and they said yes and of course it was cubed. I also asked for no beans and they threw them all over my plate. I gave one star for the spiceyness and cheese. They were also rude to me when I brought my dog, when they have no sign on their building that says that you can not have a dog there. What place in Arizona doesn't allow dogs on the patio?"}
{"text":"This place has awesome margaritas on the rocks.  It's not the fanciest place around, considering Scottsdale and all of it's pretentiousness is right down the way.  But it is a great place to relax and grab a nice meal and drink, especially by the waterfall late at night.  They have a pretty good late night menu too that I used to always order off of when I got off of work.  I love their carne adoba (?) plate!  They also have really good appetizers.  Cute place to drop by when you're in the area and just want to kick back."}
{"text":"Pretty good steak.  I know it's a New Mexican place but it's dark and loud and a friend blurted out that filet was on the menu before my eyes had a chance to adjust so I've never had anything else here after a few visits.  No problem, the filet is good, the potatoes are good and the sauce is good.  

The main negative is that this place can get kinda packed on the Friday and Saturday night so parking is a hassle even though they have their own parking lot."}
{"text":"Had a great time a the Tavern.  Liz was our bartender and she was awesome!!! Having lived in New Mexico for 3 years I get the craving every once in a while and decided to come check this place out.  The venue itself is quite surprising as it has water features and a neat decor I wasn't expecting from the strip mall location.  The food was great I enjoyed their green chile, but wished it had been a bit hotter.  I had a sampler type combo dish for dinner, everything was great if I had only one complaint, it would be that I wish I had the choice of pinto or black beans instead of just getting black beans.  The chile was good, as was the salsa, I knocked a half star off for the straight out of the bag chips.  Well worth a visit, and overall 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The hubs and I went here last night with a couple of friends. I have been here before years ago and remembered that it never really stuck in my mind as a MUST go to place. 

First off, What restaurant in AZ charges for Chips and Salsa!?!?! SERIOUSLY, Who does that! The regular salsa doesn't have much flavor to, the salsa Verde is good, but has a weird lingering after taste. 

Secondly, their newspaper menus are sooo annoying! They are all floppy and when four people are sitting at a table trying to open them and read them it gets a bit crowded and elbows in your face. 

Thirdly, the service was lacking. I had to ask for a straw a couple times, they give you straws for sodas, but not for waters. We saw our waitress maybe twice. We asked for a side of enchilada sauce and they charges a $1 for it. 

Fourth. The food. Its not terrible, but its nothing spectacular. The flour tortillas taste like they are store bought and not fresh. Their jalapeno mashed potatos are pretty dope, I will give them that much. 

Would I ask to go back here? No. Would I put up a fuss if someone else wanted to go here? Nah. I'd go again....Maybe just bring my own chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Carslbad knows know how to make a mean Carne Adovada plate. Atmosphere and staff are warm and comfortable. Wish the chips and salsa were free but they are worth the few bucks."}
{"text":"A south Scottsdale classic. Good food and chill vibe.."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and is something unique. It resembles a mining cave on the inside, and the outside has a really cool patio with a big waterfall and pool. We sat in the dining area surrounding the bar and got great service. The waitress was very attentive and you could tell she really liked her job and was knowledgeable about the entire menu. The chips and salsa were really good. The chips were a variety of white, red and blue corn with a light dusting of spices. The salsas were chunky and very tasty. They bring you red and green, and are nothing like what you get around town. Very good. I ordered the filet mignon tacos, which came topped with cheese, pico, and guacamole on flour tortillas. They were delicious. My husband got the open faced green chili hamburger which was smothered with their green chili sauce and cheese. It was amazing. 

We of course ordered drinks. My husband got  his usual beer, and I tried the skinny margarita. It was awesome and reminded me of what an authentic margarita should taste like. I also got the sangria and it was good. Not as sweet as what I normally expect though.

We will definitely go here again with our son this time as they have a kids menu. It's not a stuffy Scottsdale restaurant and has character and awesome food!"}
{"text":"Carlsbad's patio is my favorite part of the whole place! Their patio is huge and has water running through it which makes it so fun and refreshing feeling in the desert. The staff has always been friendly here, and seating inside isn't bad either but it is really dark in there/ I can't pass up sitting on a good patio. This is a great spot for me because we live across the street so we can walk there or ride our bikes. The salsas that come with the chips & salsa are much tastier than your typical salsa (I like the green one) so I recommend getting those to munch on while you wait for your entrees. The Tesuque chicken salad is the bomb, the snapper tacos are really good, and the blue corn enchiladas were pretty good too. I want to try the Habenero burger next and I definitely want to go to brunch here one day. Two complaints are that the drinks on happy hour weren't cheap they were til like $7 (originally $9) and I wish it opened before 11am for brunch because I am usually up and hungry well before 11am which in turn, forces us to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We love the New Mexico potstickers and the tequila shrimp. Yummy food and Tony, our server was super nice! Chips and salsa are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Surprised I haven't reviewed it already. I would say this is in my top few places to take visitors. You have the fountain, the bat cave thing going on, the outside seating around the water, and awesome food on top. Inside, you feel  like you are in an old lodge, adorned with license plates, memorabilia, fun things to ogle at while you swallow beer. Lots of beer. Because its great for drinking. The bartender is on top of things. 

No wings here, unless you order the BBQ chicken, which I did. I order this most often when I go after breakfast. They make a spicy sauce and roast a half chicken to perfection, served with slaw and mac and cheese sides. The mac and cheese is a SW style, try it. Yummy to the bottom. You can order a whole bowl if you are carb-loading.

I have tried many other things, they have really good burgers, many with a SW feel. 
If you really want a treat, come for breakfast where they make these twisted benedicts and burritos that look like they came off a magazine cover. You will always bring food home and always have a nice time because, well. because there is lots of beer here. Fun, fun place."}
{"text":"Such a great Mexican-American food restaurant. If you're looking for a nice but casual Mexican food place that is a little different, go to Carlsbad. I recommend sitting outside, they have a pleasant waterfall and stream under a bridge and just an overall relaxing atmosphere. They food is also terrific of course, though a lot of items lean toward the hotter side (even their black beans side is spicy). My favorite's are the Southwest Patty Melt & Chipotle Stroganoff Chicken Pasta, terrific. Great for family dinner or a date."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here during Restaurant Week. The menu looked enticing and the place sounded interesting. Boy, was it ever! The entire place is fashioned to look like the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. Walking up, it feels like you are entering another place as you walk under the large arch out front. To your left is a flowing waterfall that encompasses the patio. To be frank, the inside is dark (like a cavern). We didn't explore much inside, other than using the restroom, as my husband and I were quickly whisked to our seats on the patio. While the patio does face a busy street, we couldn't actually see the street or hear much car noise. Instead, we had a perfect view of the waterfall, eclectic décor, and night lights. Our waiter was prompt to take our drink orders and describe the Restaurant Week menu. We knew what we wanted before arriving, so we quickly ordered. The deal came with two appetizers, two meals, a dessert and a bottle of wine to share. 

I ordered the tequila shrimp as an appetizer and the Cowboy Meatloaf as my entrée. The tequila shrimp were delicious! They were spicy and perfectly cooked. My husband stole a few bites and agreed on how great they were. My entrée, the meatloaf, was good but very different. It was mixed with jalapeno bacon and gouda then topped with prickly pear glaze. This all rested on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of veggies. The flavors were good but the actual meatloaf was dry. My husband tried it and loved it. 

My husband ordered the spicy crab cakes and the Chile Rellenos. He really enjoyed the crab cakes, but thought my shrimp were better. (I agreed.) His entrée was your stranded chile rellenos - which my husband really likes. However, the portion seemed small compared to my large meatloaf dish. It was spicy and tasty. 
For dessert we shared the chocolate bread pudding. Normally, I am all about bread pudding and went through a phase of only ordering bread pudding for dessert. This particular bread pudding turned me off to bread pudding and I haven't ordered any since. It was a good chocolately taste but the texture and consistency was off. I also didn't like the butterscotch sauce. My husband, however, ate it right up and enjoyed it. 

Overall, my husband really enjoyed everything he had (and my items as well). I only really enjoyed the tequila shrimp appetizer and the scenery/vibe. I would like to take my in-laws here as I think they'd enjoy the ambiance and even the food (especially since my husband liked it so much). So we'll be back for another round."}
{"text":"More of a Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican food.  Had the chicken & shrimp enchiladas.  Rice was very dry.  Green chile sauce overpowered taste of chicken and shrimp.  Husband had the pork burrito with red sauce.  Had good flavor but was spicy.  Also ordered the green chile mashed potatoes because they sounded interesting.  Very bland.  Needed salt and pepper.  Sopa tasted like toasted bread.  Great service but overall food disappointing."}
{"text":"Would not recommend! Everything we ordered tasted like bad bar food and the lobster enchiladas were horrible. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Best late night service you can find-TRUE STORY
Not to mention the stellar menu.... I like to keep this place a secret so I always have a seat at the bar but I find myself telling Everyone to check it out.  Big Thanks to Darrel and obvi Tyler, Paul and Neil.  I don't know what this city would do without you guys"}
{"text":"Use to love this place and went here a lot with friends and family. Spend thousands here but manager Farris is a real jerk. One member of our group of ten was not feeling well so she put her head in her husbands lap. Farris approached table and kicked all ten of us out because he said she was drunk. When we tried to explain what happen he was shaking like crazy and said he would call police. What a real unprofessional and uneducated man!"}
{"text":"Carne adovada? Yes please. 

Easily the best \"mexican\" food I've ever had. Most mexican food tastes the same to me, except this place. It's just so good. 

Awesome patio too. There's pretty much no reason not to go here."}
{"text":"I love spicy foods but they are not kidding when they write CAUTION all over the menu next to the habanero burger. It is absolutely ridiculous. My boyfriend has a really high tolerance for spice and he could even eat the whole thing... but a day later he called me and said he wouldn't be ordering it again because digesting it was painful.... hahaha. I could only eat half of the habanero burger the first time I went so the second time, I just got a regular burger with bleu cheese. Was delicious though... can't wait to go back and try some other things on the menu.

Happy hour prices are great!"}
{"text":"Just flew back home from Nebraska and the flight attendant was talking about how great the guacamole was here at Carlsbad Tavern !!! So as soon as I retrieved my car at the airport I headed to Carlsbad Tavern for some Guacamole and Angus beef filet mignon tacos  thanks to my server John Blair's recommendation. Excellent !!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE, ATMOSPHERE our neighborhood bar.

Happy hours,  staff are where u wanna be"}
{"text":"Carlsbad is truly one of my favorite places in the valley, although I usually only get the opportunity to go for lunch. This place also holds a special place in my heart because it was my first real meal in Arizona. This is where I went to lunch on my first trip out here for an interview. It's also a favorite place for my coworkers and I to visit. 

First things first. The atmosphere is fantastic. The inside and outside both have great seating and I love the welcome feel you get when you arrive from both the staff and the decor. The outdoor seating area is one of the best I've ever seen. If you've never sat in between the outdoor bar and the pond, you are truly missing out. 

The food is always fantastic, well portioned, and well priced. Blue corn enchiladas are one of my favorites. Warning though, do not eat them if you are not a fan of cheese. I, however, live for cheese and am in love with them. The lunch specials they have are *always* incredible and definitely worth trying. I don't know anyone that's ever been disappointed by them. Last time I was there it was roasted chicken enchiladas with a mushroom cream sauce. Can I say please eat me now?

If you enjoy fantastic food, amazingly personable staff, and a great setting, this is a must!"}
{"text":"In the home stretch now and we're finally in some familiar territory; first stop I need my fix from Carlsbad! I have been going to this place for about 12 years now, spent literally 1000s of dollars and wasted eons (and my trusty liver) at the bar. I always like to introduce new friends to the joint, specifically for Green Chile Stew and the Carne Adovada, which can vary in Scoville units dramatically on a daily basis. Since the last drive was from Amarillo to Phoenix I had a lot of time on my hands to patiently wait for the gorge and once again I didn't let myself down. 

At the bat cave, things always start with an ice cold Negro Modelo and perhaps a shot of Gran Centenario Reposado...this is a requisite in my company. The stew is such my comfort food, thick and juicy with potatoes, carrots, tons of hot green chile & roasted pork, then covered in Colby jack and served with a tortilla. If you need any extra heat they have habanero hot sauce plus chipotle so you and your toilet are covered there. I don't know if it has magical powers or if it's just the combination of tequila, beer and the hot chile endorphin rush but I always walk out floating in my shoes and wanting more...so much so that I went back the next day to procure two quarts of green chile stew to take back home to my baby. Next, if you have never had Carne Adovada, go, go now, and seek out the majestic dish dating back to mayan or...well frankly I have no idea, but it's F'ing tasty. First they take Pork Roast and heavily marinate it in Red Chile for up to 18 hrs, then it's slow and low roasted for like a day. It just falls apart when it arrives, and the heat can be deafening, or not, depending on which Sadist is slinging beans on that particular day. It is always served piping hot with black beans and rice, and flour or blue corn tortillas to sop up the crimson mess. Top it off with about six more Negros and you are in a happy place--every time. Salud!

{"text":"I just moved into the valley and found Carlsbad Tavern.  I've been back three times in three weeks.
I just love the fairly authentic New Mexican food!
I just love Hatch green chiles.  Their carne a 
Asada and carne adovada is fantastic!
Their drinks are wonderful.
My only suggestion is that the owners send their waiters on a field trip to Albuquerque to sample the real thing so they are more knowledgable about what the serve."}
{"text":"I've had all kinds of dishes here from the Enchantment platter to the tequila shrimp to the lobster linguine special. Every time I come it seems to be even better than the last. 

Pros:
-The restaurant looks like it could be a Disneyland installment. Take that as you will. 
-Portions are generous, come hungry!
-Anything involving lobster or a cream sauce here is a winner

Cons:
-Anything involving non-seafood meat is dry or overcooked in my book
-I personally like higher sauce/veggie-to-meat ratios, but they usually pack their food full of MEAT

:) Still love you Tavern. Keep improving!"}
{"text":"LOVE Carlsbad Tavern!! It's one of my family's favorite restaurants. Amazing atmosphere and even better food! We have never been disappointed coming here."}
{"text":"The best chicken green chilie burrito! I had the Chimayo chicken, yummy!  The staff is always so freindly, Elizabeth took the best care of us! Anticipated all of our needs. 
If you like your mexican food with some spice this is the place to go. 
The happy hour is worth going early!"}
{"text":"This is a great concept however the sauces were bland for being a New Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"If you haven't been before, you are sure missing out.  A staple in Old Town Scottsdale which is on my frequent list.  Atmosphere, Food and staff are all amazing.  Food has a nice kick to eat and I haven't eaten anything I didn't throughly enjoy.  The patio is a must for a nice Az day with a cold drink.  Everyone who works there is always so happy and friendly.  Once you go once, you will fall in love and become a regular...Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay, not the best, but not the worst. Service was good and the chips/guac were pretty tasty. However, my entree wasn't that great - expected more I guess."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! Always good food and service. Connor was amazing! He was always ahead  of the ball, chips and drinks were filled before we even knew we needed a refill."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Scottsdale.  Not only is the patio adorable with fountains, a moat and great lighting; but the food is great.  I ve literally eaten nearly everything on the menu throughout the years. When the lobster burritos are on special: get them.  The chicken salad is soooooo delicious if you want to go less mexican.  Great bloody mary bar on Sundays and outstanding brunch menu."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night around 7 p.m..
we sat at the bar and ordered a bunch of food that was served promptly. Our bartender/waitress was nice and polite. I would definitely go back again.   
Try the beer battered fries and the chocolate bread pudding, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went for supper with wife and 18 month old. We sat in the same kids section we always sit in which is perfect because little HJG can make noise and fit right in. The service was as good as usual and we got good food at good prices. They have good American fare and some good green chile. The french fries are sinful. The salads are a bit olde fashioned -shredded processed cheese on top? CT is also a good spot for happy hour and to watch sports and tip back suds."}
{"text":"I had such a fabulous visit to Carlsbad back in 2011 that I couldn't wait for a return trip this year.  Unfortunately, the most recent reviews have been spot on:  the service and quality of the food has dropped a few notches.

This year I tried the chile rellenos and actually really enjoyed it.  But my mom and sister's meals arrived lukewarm.  We all enjoyed our meals, but weren't wowed enough to make a return visit in the future."}
{"text":"Upon first hearing about this new mexican food place down the street from my apartment i was not expecting anything great whatsoever. boy was i surprised. This place is definately a keeper. Not only is the atmosphere amazing (fountains and candle light) but the blue corn enchiladas i had and continue to have are so delicious that i keeps me crawling back. I definately recommend anyone to try."}

{"text":"Being born in Arizona, I take my Mexican Food pretty seriously and this is one of my favorites. I go specifically for the Carne Adovada plate.  Next time I go back I will be trying the Habanero Burger that everyone keeps talking about."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend that is originally from New Mexico and thinks New Mexico Mexican food is the best around.  Being from the NW originally, Mexican food is pretty much all the same to me (I know that makes many, many people want to hurt me right now).  We decided to hit up happy hour after work.  They have happy hour from 3-6 and we arrived a little after 5, so it was busy, but we were still able to sit at the bar.  The problem was the only two seats left were the one where my friend kept getting hit with the drink garnishment tray every time the bartender opened it and the one where the sun was piercing into my retinas if my friend didn't strategically place her head.

We decided to stick it out to take advantage of happy hour at the bar.  We would have sat at a table behind the bar, but we were told that happy hour didn't apply there and it was for dinner only.  The happy hour there isn't so happy - Unless you think $1 off of a $9 appetizer is a deal.  Granted, there were a few lower priced items if you just wanted items such as chips and salsa, but let's face it, we take advantage of happy hour so you can get the overly priced apps for what they're really worth.  We didn't really think the specials were anything special, so we decided to pay for the drinks (no tax at the bar - a helpful hint from the bartender) and get a table for dinner.

The whole place is pretty cool inside and the patio would have been even better had it been a little bit warmer or if we had on a few more layers.  The dark wood and low lighting make it cozy and comfortable inside.  We ended up ordering the nachos to share and they were delicious with chipotle chips, black beans, cheese, and lots of other goodness.  My New Mexican guru told me green chile anything is the way to go, so we both ordered a bowl of the green chile stew.  It was good and I was satisfied, but nothing to write home about.

The service was good, as was the food, but I would only give it 3.5 stars.  The extra star is because if you go here for only one reason, go for the basket of sopapillas - it's worth it.  No more needs to be said, just go there and order them and you'll know what I'm talking about.  And don't give me the crap story about how you don't like fried dough with powdered sugar on it that you pour honey inside of because that's just crazy talk!"}
{"text":"My husband and I having been coming here for years and the food AND service never disappoints!! I recommend the carlsbad tacos and my husband's favorite is always the habenero sliders from the late night menu. Always a good time here!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's one of those rare gems that's open late and has excellent food and drinks.

The food is always consistent and it is available until 2am. My favorite dish is the green chili cheese crisp. It's basically a toasted tortilla that is topped with New Mexican Hatch Green Chilies, tomatoes, and cheese.

The Green Chilies are what make this cheese crisp so amazing. I've even eaten them with a fried egg on top for breakfast, but the eggs Benedict with Jalapeño hollandaise are also amazing. 

They also make blue corn enchiladas that have their amazing green chili sauce as well. One is filled with shrimp, the other chicken. Make sure if you get a salad to try the jalapeño ranch, it's awesome too.

Carlsbad has really cool seating outside with a giant water fountain that wraps around the restaurant and bridges that span over it. They also have a Bloody Mary bar on weekends and TVs outside for the football games."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place but can't. Their food is not authentic New Mexican. When my husband asked for extra hot they added a line of habaneros which made it in edible. Their latest is their horribly inappropriately priced tequila. Plenty of options exist in the area for better food and better priced liquor. We like the service, so it's unfortunate they have a tough gig to follow.  We've tried many times to support this place but will no longer."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Never too packed, always great service. Love the nachos and the steak salad. The patio is great with water and misters around which make in comfortable even when it's a little hotter out here. This is a great local favorite and always an easy go to!  The place is big, but the way they have it set up never makes you feel like your in a huge place!"}
{"text":"My husband & I love this place. The enchiladas are amazing and so is enchantment platter. They do put a ton of cheese on everything so be mindful of that."}
{"text":"Coming here has become a traditional thing for our family. And last night did not disappoint. Good food, good service, great atmosphere. Did they raise the prices recently? 17.00 for a salad? The Sante Fe Club was good and my cousin really enjoyed the Meatloaf. I just remembered it being more traditional Mexican food and less Americanized, but still a cool spot:)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food... The best Arizona/New Mexico food we have had since moving here. Very Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Driving down this part of Hayden and away from Old Town Scottsdale, you wouldn't expect to find the treasure that is Carlsbad Tavern.

Can't tell you how many times I've drove past it on my work runs, promising I'd give it a go. Well, that someday was two weeks ago (a Friday night) and . . . Well . . . Mind has been blown! 

The atmosphere here is refreshing coupled with attentive service. Maybe this is the margarita talking, but really did feel like I stepped into a cavern. Gorgeous patio surrounded by water and fountains, which is why we opted to sit out there. 

Great for larger groups; also the perfect ambience for a summer date night. Emphasis on night, since we all know how hot it gets here.

Free chips and salsa when you check-in on Yelp. Was it that spicy? Nah. But it didn't TASTE like someone scooped it out of a jar. The green / tomatillo sauce was especially tangy. Also, the chips had some sort of seasoning on them which was a nice touch. 

That Cruzan Pineapple Margarita? No bueno; he tenido mejor sin una carga de Triple Sec. 

Tip: When you look at the menu, it gives you warnings about the spice levels. Unlike many restaurants around the Valley that employ this practice, they aren't joking, so prepare to eat once, enjoy twice if you don't heed them. Whoa, sorry, that was wholly inappropriate! :) 

Also, if you're looking for Green Chile, you won't be disappointed. The menu has an entire section devoted to just that. 

I had the Green Chile Burrito with Machaca; the Dude tried the Enchantment Platter. Woweeee! My ears were ringing all night after this. The Machaca wasn't tough, which was nice. Los Dos Molinos? Watch out, you've got some competition. 

The Enchantment Platter had one of the best Chile Rellenos I've had that wasn't homemade by someone's Nana. Read: Not eggy or soggy. 

Massive portions, took the other half home.  

Gave the Sopas a try after reading Ursula D.'s review. Wow!!!!

Is it a true New Mexico experience? Not sure. But Carlsbad Tavern certainly delivered in the spicy \"melt your face off\" department!"}
{"text":"Only reason why I'm only giving 4 stars is because of the manager Art that we had to deal with. Natalie was our server and she was amazing. I would give her 10 stars if I could. The owner of our company passed away on April 2nd a few years ago. For the past couple years we have done a happy hour/dinner at Carlsbad tavern. We have never had a problem until this year with Art. I called a week before and made a reservation just like I have done in the past and everything went smoothly and the girl that I spoke to said she wrote us down. Art called the following day and left a message to call him back to confirm. I had never had to do this before. I called back and he was not at work I called the following day and he wasn't at work again. I didn't leave a message which now thinking back I should have. He called me a total of 2 times and I called him 3. When I arrived an hour before our reservation the day of I was greeted by Art rudely. He pointed out to me that he did not have a reservation down and argued that he called me three times. He expressed that they would seat us but that my party of 20 would only have one server. I didn't mine only having one server since I knew we would be there for several hours. Thankfully we received Natalie as our server. I overheard Art arguing with another guest even bringing out the reservation book to the customer showing her that her name wasn't written down. Art gave our party of 20 and their party of about 15 both to Natalie. She was a rockstar and handle both parties. If it was just for Art we would not have next years party at this location. Since they do have employees like Natalie we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the carne adovada plate which was good but needed a bit of salt. My friend had the veggie enchiladas that he said were very good. Now let's talk about the inside waterfall! We were sat right next to it, which means we were in a spotlight. It's a little sad looking and was foaming. The fake fern plant was backwards and looked a little decrepit. Our night also started with the hostess sitting us and then five minutes later coming up and saying she made a mistake and asked us to get up. She did buy us our first round of drinks though. We then got placed next to the waterfall in the spotlight. It took the waitress about 7 minutes to come greet us at the table after we were sat at the correct one. All in all though, we did have a great night. The food was decent, but the company was better."}
{"text":"1st visit.  Greeted by a waiter who had a great sense of humor; his football team was losing.  I told him I was sorry and he said I didn't look very sincere because I was smiling!  That kind of humor makes me want to come back already!  My waiter Ryan's asked if I'd ever been there.  I had not so I said he explained the menu and spiciness of the food and brought samples of the sauces!  MUCH appreciated.   I ordered the Cabo Wabo margarita and shrimp tacos., then decided to check in! Surprise, free chips and salsa.  The red is way good, and I'm from Texas where we pick our restaurants based on the salsa!  Drink is damned DELICIOUS!  Shrimp tacos are very good.  Three tacos and a bowl of black beans for $8.75 during happy hour?  That's a great deal!  

The only thing I didn't care for was the bowl/cup the salsa was served in.  It came with a spoon so I'm probably supposed to be spooning the salsa onto my chip, but for a girl from Texas that's just too damned much trouble!  We like to dip our chips and the sides of the cup are a bit too tall for that.  

Wish we had a Carlsbad Tavern in Austin!  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We love this place. They have a great happy hour, a nice, big patio, and our server, Lottie, was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place until today, it was suggested by a friend and boy was I pleased. It was so good! I had the avadavo which was really good and I'm not a huge pork fan. I also tried the green chili Mac and that was bomb.com this place is a must. Very dark and secluded make a great date nite place."}
{"text":"We stopped by here before a spring training game and we had already eaten, so I can only review the service and the drinks. 

First off this place is really cool to hang out in. We sat outside in the sun with the water going and some music playing. It was really nice. All of the servers were quick and awesome. I did the make your own bloody mary bar and the guys had beers. It was a good pour of vodka and plenty of add-ons for the drink. I then had a mimosa which was good. 

The guys got some food which looked awesome but I was too full to even try. Fiance got tequila shrimp (I think that's what it was called) but its an app of grilled shrimp on a bed of black beans. 

We don't go to this side of town very often but I hope I get to go back here since the menu looked awesome."}
{"text":"Great surprise-- I have driven by this place several times-- food was excellent-- I had the Enchantment platter-- just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming-

Cool cave-like atmosphere inside and fun patio area-- I will definitely be back and bring out of towners"}
{"text":"I realized that I drive by Carlsbad only about 12 times per average workday, and haven't been here in 8 years.  That's nearly 35,040 times, give or take a few.

SO...  I decided it was time to give it another try.  

Then I realized why I hadn't been back in 8 years.  

Bland food, bland food, and bland food. 

Sorry, but it's true.  

Will probably be at least another 8 years."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience the second time around. My husband and I came here for lunch one weekend day and ordered the same thing I had last time, the carne adovada green chili burrito. It was terribly disappointing. The burrito was much smaller and less full than my first visit, and the carne adovada was horribly over-cooked. Some of the pieces were so tough I couldn't chew through them. The salsas had very little flavor as well. 

There was only one other table occupied when we were there, and although we received our food quickly, it took a while after we were seated until our waitress arrived to take our order. She was nice but you could smell alcohol on her breath, it was pretty noticeable. 

After that experience I would be very hesitant to return."}
{"text":"First time here a little warm but comfortable on the patio server was very helpful in taking our order we will be back"}
{"text":"Dropped a star maybe it was just an of day but my food wasn't as good as past experiences. The near was greasy and the rice andbeans seemed kinda old.  The lunch prices are west over priced and the specials are horrible for lunch.  Sandwiches no discounted burritos so my lunch with tip and tax was $17 with only water."}
{"text":"Carlsbat Cavern, or rather, Carlsbad Tavern, is a campy New Mexcian restaurant/bar that was the \"ethnic\" concession made to me by my parents after pleading to go to at least one regionally appropriate restaurant during my visit.

What do I mean by campy, you ask?
- Stuffed animal bats on the ceiling. As G.O.B. from AD would say, \"Come on!\"
- Newspaper menus headlined \"The Daily Guano\"
- Bat sauce: a Habanero-based hot sauce that was mild considering the base
- A cave-themed interior, a bar area, and a decorative pool/moat exterior

After I assisted my sheltered family in translating the \"unfamiliar\" menu, we consumed:
- Nachos (~$6 on HH, normally ~$9): Chips were a bit light for the heaping toppings
- Lobster Enchiladas (~$16): Disappointing - slightly bitter and not much taste overall
- Chile Rellenos (~$11): Peppers stuffed with pork and cheese, tasty but a bit heavy
- Green Chile Mac + Cheese (~$6): Standard with appreciably subtle pepper flavor
- Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7): Too much cake and too much sugar, not enough cocoa
- Chocolate Eruption ($7): A \"cake\" with hardened chocolate mousse and cheesecake chunks; better than the aforementioned but still overly sweet

On happy hour, for a meal made of discounted appetizers and ~$4 margaritas, I could see this being a fun choice, but skip dinner (even though admittedly I am compelled by the ample outdoor moatside seating and the Habanero burger replete with medical warnings.) While I don't feel I wasted my restaurant selection, I also don't feel I prospected and struck pay dirt in Carlsbad Tavern either and I'm sure gold is out there."}
{"text":"I wish I liked this place as it is close to home and has a good hh. The food though has yet to impress. We've given it a handful of tries as we really wanted to like this place but unfortunately we have left sick to our stomach's and regretful. The food is really greasy and lacks flavor."}
{"text":"We were greeted warmly by the hostess and acknowledged by passing servers with a smile. The outdoor seating area was intimate, yet relaxed, with tables full of folks sharing friendly banter. The hostess stayed with us for a moment, suggesting her favorite menu options. Our server was just as delightful, and also had good suggestions based on our personal tastes. The salsa was fantastic. The food was VERY tasty. The margaritas were delicious, made with the restaurant's own sweet and sour recipe. My husband said, \"If we lived here, we would be regulars.\" Impressive compliment, since he is not as easily pleased as I am."}
{"text":"On the surface, this greasy spoon spot was just what I was in the mood for. I wasn't in the mood for salsa with canned tomatoes, guacamole that obviously came from a package, and margaritas that somehow tasted like they were made with dirty water. The enchantment platter is a lot of food. I don't know if it was the great green chili that I had at Maria's a day before, but this was a little bitter, and tasteless. Looks like a lot of reviews comment on how dry the chicken is.....I can confirm its super dry."}
{"text":"I love this place. The patio is delightful and the food is spicy and delicious. My party of 4 shared some really good appetizers and then we ordered  chili rellenos, a crab stuffed chili dish and a variety plate with 3 different items. Everything was delicious!

The service is very good. We asked for some more of the red sauce and it was brought to us in a minute. Water glasses were refilled before they were empty.

They also make excellent burgers but do tend to overcook. If you want medium well, ask for medium rare. On another occasion we asked for medium well and got hockey pucks.

On your birthday you get a choice of a margarita or a flan. I got the flan and it was splendid. My companions ordered the key lime pie, bread pudding and a chocolate cake. Everything was yummy. 

It's a nicely decorated restaurant with excellent food and good service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What happened to this place! Everybody used to love working here and now that's not the case and it shows! I have been coming here for years it's too bad that the owner and his wife cannot recognize the value of great management, bartenders and amazing waitstaff. 
Now for the reason why you come to a restaurant the food... was told they don't put chips and salsa on the tables anymore because it's too expensive and nobody eats it !?! The nachos  which they have been known for was terrible also the size was half of what it used to be for the same price. Once again here is an amazing restaurant that has been around for a long time and has to start cutting corners for some reason.... some major corners! There are way too many excellent restaurants out there folks skip this one."}
{"text":"Small, local bar with New Mexican food. We went for happy hour on a Monday and ordered chicken quesdaillas and chicken nachos. The service was amazing. The bartender was our server and a hostess for the restaurant. Despite her having to hustle and bustle all around the restaurant, she kept up a happy and a very pleasant attitude and she kept an eye on our food and drinks at all times.

They had great beer on tap for hh ($3). The food was good but kind of heavy, but my husband said that New Mexican food is like that. I think we found our local reverse happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and a unique place to go. I ordered the habanero burger and it really lit me up. As I was nearly finished the waiter remembered it is supposed to come with a free glass of milk (which I didn't get)."}
{"text":"If you are looking for spicy this place is it!  Blue Corn enchiladas are amazing and definitely the best patty melt in town!"}
{"text":"Best bar food in Scottsdale. Nice atmosphere with friendly clientele, and a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Huge portions of tasty food... bring an appetite. Nice outside seating area which is great when the weather is nice.  I've never had bad service here, the staff has always been good and have made some great recommendations"}
{"text":"This is a cool restaurant.  I didn't explore too much of it, but it has a nice bar and the outside seating area is really pretty, with multiple levels and waterworks.  When we ate here it was a little chilly still at night, so the heat lamps were appreciated.

Service was a little spotty all night.  We ran dry on water a few times, and it seemed like it took forever for our food to come out.  We had some chips and salsa (mediocre, unfortunately, and not free, doubly unfortunately) to tide us over, but things were definitely not moving quickly.

The main courses, though, were good.  I had the stacked enchiladas, which were so big and different they barely registered as enchiladas.  They had good spice to them, though, and I liked being able to have two different meats going on.  The fried egg was a bit unnecessary, though.  I was hoping for a runny yolk, because I love me some runny yolks, but it didn't have one, and thus didn't add much.

Tanya enjoyed her Tesuque chicken salad.  It did have a surprising amount of spice to it between the veggies and the tasty dressing.  The jalapeno bacon was good, too, but the tortilla crusted chicken was more crust than chicken, which was a bit disappointing.

Our companions had lobster enchiladas, which seemed to be the biggest hit of the night, and crab stuffed poblanos, which were also popular.  I didn't get to try those, so that's just hearsay, but they appear to be safe bets.

Overall, things were mostly good, but there were some little issues that held it back from being a great meal.  I would definitely come back, though."}
{"text":"Habenero burger has great beef. The heat could be cranked up another couple of notches.  The carne adovada is great"}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are great! Local magazine recommended and wife and I happy we went here. Nachos were above average and food was great! Cool decor and good waitress. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went to CBT after a spring training game. Excellent Patio seating. Great Happy Hour. I recommend the Habanero Sliders. And the Casa Nachos. The server was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly. The Flan and Sopapillas where the perfect way to end the day. Check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted NM green chili.  This place delivered!!!!  If I was a local this would be one of my favorite restaurants.  Jeremy, our server, was fantastic!  I even bought some green chili sauce to take back to Californi"}
{"text":"I can't say I hated it, I can't say I loved it. Everything was spicy, which I like, but it almost felt like a broken record. It's almost as if they were masking the lack of flavor with spice. The salsa was mediocre (at best) and the chips were okay. Entrees start around $15 and the chips and salsa are not free (huge negative). 

Luckily, I have this handy dandy Yelp app on my phone that scored us both the free chips and salsa AND 7% off our meal, putting $2.23 back in my pocket. 

It was over 100 out and yet the misters outside made it feel so nice, so for ambiance (outside), I give the place a 9. The place was quiet for a Saturday but walking in, you would've guessed we were entering an amusement park. They really focused on their \"curb appeal\" with this place.

With a ridiculous amount of restaurants to choose from in the area and being so new, this place is off the list on places we will return to, but in all, it was fine."}
{"text":"~3.5

I was wanting to take my bf out to Brat Haus, but after reading the reviews decided to let it season up a bit. looking for places near Old Town, I read about Carlsbad Tavern and since I have a new fondness to green chile, we decided to come here. We were greeted promptly at the door and asked if we wanted to seat in the bar or the dining room. The inside is pretty small from what I saw (compared to the patio area), and we decided to sit in the bar. 

Used my Yelp check in for free chips & salsa, which were okay. I had a skinny margarita, as it was HH and it was very good and strong. We both had burritos, I had the green chile burrito with adovado, which was very good! I had the leftovers today which were just as delicious. The only reason this isn't a 4 is because the interior could use some attention, even though it's campy, there was visible dust and cobwebs. 

Either way, I'll probably be back"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely to die for. I have been there twice now, and everything I get is unbelievably flavorful. The service is always great as well. 

Things I've had:
Southwest mac n cheese - This is a bowl of creamy heaven with a just a bit of a kick that will make your tastebuds sing.

Filet salad - Holy yum. I asked for this with no tomatoes, and apparently their avocado salsa has tomatoes in it as well, so they gave me just a ridiculously wonderful amount of sliced avocado instead. How thoughtful of my waiter to make that adjustment for me. 

Deep fried ice cream - If you need to know one single thing about me, you should know that ice cream is my weakness. It's also my one true love. And my soul mate. If it was up to me, I would eat this for every meal, every single day, for the rest of my life. My waistline might hate me, but my tummy would die a glorious deep fried ice cream filled death. And it would be totally worth it.

The point is, the service is great, the atmosphere is awesome, and the food is phenomenal. If you are looking for somewhere to have a great meal, this is hands down the best place in the area."}
{"text":"Visited recently for the first time.  Enjoyed happy hour appetizers on the patio.  Cool place for outdoor dining, the waterfall added a nice background.  They offer smoking and non-smoking on separate sides of the patio.  Of course you know that if anyone is smoking, the entire area gets to \"enjoy\" the smoke.  Being a non-smoker, I would appreciate an true non-smoking area but being outdoors was too compelling to pass on this beautiful day.  Another small observation - the tables were too low for the chairs causing you to lean over to eat and the chairs were not comfortable at all.  

We ordered chicken quesadilla & crab cake appetizer.  The quesadilla was made w/ green chiles and cheese, served w/ green & red salsa.  Didn't care for the red salsa but the green was pretty good, rather mild.  A side of sour cream was all that was missing here.  Crab cakes were ok, nothing special.  Served w/ a nice side salad it made a very good small meal.  A side of some kind of orange sauce (chipotle?) for the crab cakes that seemed really HOT to me - skip this next time please.

Just based on the outdoor atmosphere alone, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We first FINALLY stopped in here for lunch one day and I LOVEDDD the atmosphere...particularly the outdoor seating. I had been trying to plan my Mom's birthday party and instantly knew this would be the perfect location. 
I spoke with the manager,  Tolan, who was SO SO accommodating to arrange a large group of people for my mothers birthday party. During the party, all the servers were SO on top of things, and never was there any confusion on how the bill was handled etc. Everything was perfect. I was impressed by that and the food enough that this is now our \"go to\" place for lunch"}
{"text":"Thank you for the excellent service Connor. Great atmosphere and food, Connor was very attentive and knowledgeable about to menu. First time here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for dinner Friday night since the restaurant we wanted to was super busy as it was restaurant week. I've driven by this place several times but never thought to go in. Their big bat sign in the front looks like Batman should dine there and I was never sure exactly what that place was. However, I remember reading a review not too long ago for this place that my friend wrote and decided that I wanted to put it on my list of places to try. 

We got seated right away which was great since they looked pretty busy. The lighting inside is super dark. Their menus are printed on mock-newspapers which are very hard to read and not practical when you have 5 people crammed into a booth. After fighting each other off with our elbows and putting the menus 2 inches from our face so that we could read them, we all decided on what to get. Make sure you check-in too since you get a free chip and salsa app (free refills!). I wasn't too hungry since I had a big lunch so I opted for the crab cakes. The entrees were all pretty pricey, not that the crab cakes weren't but they were still cheaper. When they came out, there were two small crab cakes buried in dressingless salad on top of a grilled tortilla. The crab cakes were pretty good, nothing spectacular. The presentation was pretty odd and seems very inefficient money wise. Vegetables are not cheap and they wasted a lot of perfectly good greens. I tried eating some of it since I don't like to waste food but since it didn't come with any dressing and I'm not a bunny, I left the majority of it on my plate. I tried my boyfriend's quesadilla and it was pretty good. The serving wasn't huge, like half the size of a tortilla. They also used some kind of cheese that I didn't like, it was a little too pungent for me to use with a quesadilla. My friend got the pork chops and let us try a small bite. I don't really care for pork but I have to say that it was really good. The glaze/sauce that it was covered in was sweet and just right. 

Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I didn't want to spend a ton of money on food when I wasn't that hungry. If I were going to spend that much money on an entree, I'd rather go somewhere else. The service was great and our server made sure that our glasses were always filled with water. Overall, this place was kind of a miss for me but now I can say that I've been to the bat cave and wont have to wonder any more."}
{"text":"Do not order the lobster enchiladas. Stretched some very nice lobster meat with disgusting cream cheese filling that overwhelms the delicate flavor of the meat. What a waste."}
{"text":"I'm wavering between 2 and 3 stars. Good thing I had a dang good sandwich...

So, this place is kind of funny. I live right down the street and had no idea it existed--It's kind of tucked back in a parking lot. The gigantic fake waterfall outside the front entrance makes you feel like you're about to stand in line for one of those water rides where you're thrown around in a log boat at an amusement park. There are bats decorating the whole place. It's just funky.

We were greeted by the bartender, who sat the 5 of us (me, parents, grandparents) and promptly walked away. It became very clear to me that the one lone server was in over his head (although I only saw 2 tables outside by the waterfall and one other table besides us) while we waited AND WAITED to be greeted. Bartender had no one to tend bar for. She couldn't have at least helped the dude out and taken our drink orders? Server was slightly spastic but nice enough. It took a while to get our drinks and then even MORE of a while to place our order. He was running in and outside like a crazy person. To his credit our order came out correctly.

The menu is semi-hilarious. It's inside a fake newspaper and boasts all kinds of tex-mex/grill/general meat-loving delicacies. Being a vegetarian, I was all \"buh\" but thought the \"Portales Portabella\" sounded delicious. 

...AND IT WAS. At huge sandwich of a basamic-marinated portabella on fresh focaccia with different roasted peppers, red onion, pepperjack and avocado. Hot diggity (what?) it was good. I could barely eat half and savored the leftovers for the next meal. It was served with a huge portion of seasoned fries. 

My grandma tried the green chili mac and a side order portion was pretty huge. It was tasty--pepperjack and cheddar cheese, corn, chiles...all served in a tortilla-covered bowl. Have you heard my new rap song, carbsoncarbsoncarbs?

In all, it was an OK lunch. Again, I was pretty appalled by the lack of help the one server got from the bartender and manager who seemingly had not much to do. Maybe I'm just sensitive to my fellow service industry family?"}
{"text":"A far cry from actual New Mexico food. Chips and salsa not complimentary. Salsa is not hot or good. They dont serve pinto beans. Ive tried this place twice. The last time was with my fiance, neither one of us was happy with the food. The best thing about this place is the outdoor patio and atmosphere. I was born and raised in New Mexico. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Having free chips and salsa with the yelp coupon. Very good. We all had the specialty Margaritas I had the Cabo Wabo. Very tasty! The outside seating is very cool with waterfall and river features."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great outdoor seating. Open late, late night bites are yummy! Lobster Enchiladas are FANTASTIC! Good prices and good food, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"This is a place I will not be visiting again because it's in a location that we don't normally frequent and based on my experience it's not worth the drive out there again. It was a spur of the moment stop for us so I walked in to get us seated and the older woman at the front did not have a welcoming demeanor. She was out of uniform so I assume she must have been a member of management. However, I let her know there was five of us but got no reply or acknowledgement so I said it a second time. Then in a snotty tone asked if we had reservations. I should have turned around & left but instead I stayed & let her know we did not. She sat us down & then told me she'd have to throw my brand new Starbucks tea out or I have to put it under table at my feet. Uh no ma'am..i just bought this tea before my party decided to stop & eat & I didn't want to leave it the hot car to get warm while we ate. It's not like I wasn't going to order their food & beverages. I reluctantly took my tea back to the car but I was upset so I decided not to order anything to eat or drink.  Three members of my party decided they still wanted to eat so they ordered. Their feedback was that the burger and enchantment platter were good.  That said, the enchantment platter looked great so I ordered one to go with no beans. Our server confirmed my request and then we waited a really long time for it to come out. Finally it was out & we're ready to go but I check the order for accuracy. The order that was supposed to have no beans had extra beans! We didnt have time to wait for a new order so we asked for a refund. However, we were not offered a new order we were offered rice on the side. Uh no thank you...we asked for no beans for a reason. I don't think I have to say I have food allergy each time.  If I ask for no beans on anything I expect the kitchen to do as requested. Unfortunately I don't have a review of how food tastes. 

Our server was very nice but very busy. This rating is not a reflection of his service. I am giving them a 3 star because the others in my group seemed to be satisfied with their food. Otherwise it'd  be lower.

And yes by the time I got to my car my yea was warm &almost all the ice melted so double loss for me."}
{"text":"We lived in NM for 14 years and I was disappointed that they did not have ground beef on the menu.  That is a staple for all New Mexican restaurants.  The waitress wasn't very friendly either.  The only thing good about the place is the atmosphere and decorations."}
{"text":"The food was too spicy to enjoy. The service was slow. The restaurant wasn't busy so we couldn't figure out what was taking so long. Raylie (sp?) was our server. She wasn't friendly. I asked for a side of retried beans, they brought black beans.  it took awhile to get out drinks and food. Great atmosphere. But we won't be coming back. We had a party of 12 so the 20% gratuity was a must and she was lucky. She didn't deserve that good of a tip."}
{"text":"Everything is spicy, even their ranch dip. I loved it, but the kids in our group were all pretty unhappy with the spiciness. It's definitely not authentic New Mexican food, but it's very good if you can handle the heat."}
{"text":"Excellent late night dining menu. Can't wait to go back during their regular hours. Service was great. Steven was our server and did a great job. Great margaritas!! :)"}
{"text":"Having lived in NM for almost 20 years, this is as close to home as I'll get in Scottsdale. 

I'm a huge blue corn enchilada fan. The blue corn enchiladas here where pretty good.  Rock shrimp is an odd mix on this dish but it worked. The flavor marination wasn't as coordinated as I'm used to in NM. The bar is high, I admit.

The NM mule name didn't make sense but it was also good nonetheless.  It's a very sweet version of the Moscow - warning only.  

I've avoided this restaurant due to its bad service rep. Our service was spot on. 

What this restaurant has is theme park ambience, which is a nice break from the formal norm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"OK. I don't usually update reviews after being contacted by the owner but since I didn't sample the food I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

Cons:
- Not veggie-friendly (way too many meat heavy dishes on the menue)
- Smelly (chemical) water feature outside would make outside dinner near it not so appealling

Pros:
- Plenty of parking
- Attentive staff
- Fondness for bats
- Locally owned and operated

It wasn't what I wanted and apparently they're not going the chain route so my judgement is held in check...for now.  :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I LOVED this place! I ordered the lobster enchiladas, and oh my gosh, it was SO delicious. All my friends loved their dishes as well. The service was also friendly and fast. I was sad we went here on the last day of our trip. Otherwise I would have come back for another meal! I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I visited Arizona for the weekend and was looking for great food for a reasonable price. This is the place. We were seated and greeted immediately. I ordered the blue corn enchiladas which were amazing! Beware of the spiciness. I wasn't expecting it to be spicy but it was definitely a good choice. The lighting and atmosphere was great along with the servers. Everyone was friendly and quick to check on us throughout the evening to see if we needed anything. I'd definitely come back again on my next trip out here."}
{"text":"Elizabeth is the BEST server of all time. She took great care of our party of 8. Great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, we love this place for sure.  The Mac and Cheese is great and the Southwest dumpling things are A-mazing.  My husband is a fan of one of their pork dishes - we get the same thing every time.  The service is spotty for sure.  I suggest going and sitting at the bar whenever possible and DO NOT go with a large party and expect to get taken care of properly.  I was embarrassed a couple times when we have taken friends and out of town guests there after I raved up and down about it.  We just go by ourselves now but hey - at least the food makes up for the service :)"}
{"text":"We visit here about once every few months. Love this place. Ambiance is fabulous. Hours are late. Service excellent. Our favorites are the chips and two salsas, the new mexican potstickers, and the machaca red chile chimichunga. We've deviated from getting this exact thing once in awhile but keep going back to this combo. LOVE IT! I, personally, cannot say enough about the potstickers. It's the strangest combination and it shouldn't work, but it DOES! I crave them. I crave them NOW. I keep trying to remember to order them after my entree, as they would be a perfect compliment after the machaca which can sometimes be very spicy. But, the sopapillas are also a perfect meal ender after spiciness. We once had an issue with the salsa being bitter, but found that they forgot to add sugar when mixing it. The owner/manager was right on top of it and comped it - so no complaint there, in the end. Service is always exceptional. We always just show up, without a reservation and never have an issue getting a table - even when it looks to be packed. I love this place! Wish we would go more often but it really is something special and we want to keep it that way. You're bat crazy (HA!) if you don't visit this place at least once. And, get those potstickers!!!"}
{"text":"Eh I have experienced better, but I felt the 2 star mark was a bit harsh. I wasn't really disappointed in anything in our experience, I think my issue mostly was the fire burning in my chest for an hour after dinner. Their food is spicy!

We were seated in the bar area, perfect because the Sunday night football game was on and we had a perfect seat to watch. We started off with a couple of bears and their crap cake appetizer. I enjoyed the crap, boyfriend thought it was bland, but he is from Michigan and has very high standards for crab, so we will ignore him. It came with a nice tossed salad and an extremely hot dipping sauce. If you like that sort of thing, awesome, if not you should stay away from the sauce. 

For dinner he got the roasted chicken with mac 'n' cheese, chicken was tasty and the mac 'n' cheese was to die for! I got the stacked enchiladas, subed green sauce for the red though, again their shit is spicy! The flavors of the meat were fantastic, however there is a lot going on with this place. I could only eat maybe a quarter of it. I would recomend both. 

They also have this burger on the menu that is pretty much 100% made out of hobenerros; mixed into the patty, on top of the patty and in a sauce on the burger. They even have a disclaimer on the menu stating \"You order it, you own is.\" So not take backs. I witnessed a friend try to eat this once, it was so hot he just got made about it. Spitefully ate the whole thing those, I am pretty sure it gave him an ulcer or two. 

Over all good place, but I wouldn't venture back unless it was very convenient to my location and I was in the mood for some heart burn and breathing fire."}
{"text":"12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon, end of July... this adventure to Carlsbad Tavern was sheer deliciousness!  Even as we walked to the front door, it was delightful to see water and a waterfall outside... making each of us trying to remember what cooler than 110 degrees is like.  Once inside, it was wonderful, the perfect temperature and a bit dark like a cave, but not so dark as not to be able to read the menu.   
      I ordered the special of the day, Blackened Shrimp on a house salad with deep fried onion crisps on top.  The dressing was a jalapeno ranch.  In the center, under the onion crispies, was a guacamole mash of some sort.  (The official description makes it sound much better!)   I LOVED it!   Just the right amount of flavor and heat.  
     Just before we got our lunch, we realized there is a Yelp Check In special!  So we got Chips and salsa for free!  Got to love that!!!
     My lunch partners really enjoyed their meals too.  One had the Patty Melt.  Ate as much as she could... plenty and yummy!  Betty had the Carne Adovada Plate and in her words, \"It was delicious.\"   
     Tracy was our server and she did absolutely everything right.  Perfect in friendliness, menu knowledge and making sure we had what we needed right away.  We appreciated her very much.
      I look forward to going back to try some more items.   Back to the Bat Cave!"}
{"text":"I can really only review the beer selection (not bad) and the service (quite good, considering the size of our group).

I did get to watch some of my friends try a habanero burger. The fools. I snacked on a few things and everything was excellent. No, I skipped the habanero buger, thanks all the same.

All and all, a good place. Great atmosphere and a killer patio. I'll go back. And this time, I'll eat."}
{"text":"Great waterfall feature on the patio. Food was great and server was very knowledgeable. Potstickers are a must and so is the green chile Mac n cheese but definitely add carne adovado. Carne Asade fries were tasty but not for anyone who can't handle spice! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It has been several years since I dined at Carlsbad Tavern. However, I remember the food was fantastic. Charming atmosphere too. Friendly staff. When people I know are visiting the Phoenix area I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting horrible food :(. Ordered the chips and salsa - the salsa had gone to vinegar - disgusting.  I have tried this place 6 times in 18 months and have sent back 3 meals.  Interestingly they want to charge you $7 to add guacamole - totally afraid to even try :-/"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and Yelp'd \"Nearby\" on my phone, so we ended up here.  Like several other reviewers, we are baffled by the many five star reviews of this place.

When we walked in, the first thing that struck us was the extremely unfriendly greeting.  The restaurant was nearly deserted at 8:30 and we didn't feel very welcome.

The second thing that struck us was, despite its claims to be a \"New Mexican\" restaurant, it's really more of a generic type menu.  Speaking of the menus, they are printed on newsprint and were filthy.  The restaurant in general was not very clean.

All in all, mediocre and over-priced.   We tried the Habenero burger and the machaca chimichanga.  Both just average and comparable to your typical chain restaurant.  The black beans were inedible and the rice was microwaved and obviously quite old.  

We asked for some chips while we were waiting and we were told that they were $3.00.  Uhm, ok.  Surprisingly, they turned out to be the best part of the meal.

Our server was pleasant enough but the overall vibe was unfriendly despite the fact that there were only 3 or 4 tables in the immense dark cavern that is this restaurant.

I guess the next time we're in the mood for actual New Mexican food, we'll have to drive over to Rokerij and hit up the Robertson's menu there.  Vastly superior to this joint in every way.

$40 with tip and one beer. I can't imagine ever returning here."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for few years now.  Love the unique outdoor and indoor space!  Service is always prompt and friendly.  I love their potstickers, crab cake salad and of course the Margaritas!!  We bring our out of town guest for the New Mexican cuisine and outdoor dinning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to take a visitor from out of town. The place is somewhat seasonal because you really should eat on the outside patio. It's definitely a fun atmosphere and the food is actually good (sometimes). I found the service to be nice as well - although they seem to frantically run around like chickens with their heads cut off not knowing what to do next. Their stress stresses me out. If you have kids, they'll love this as a treat and will probably remember it forever.

Their margaritas are average and their mexican food is actually shitty and 80s and standard. It's edible, but not good. Their American food is pretty good though. You're going to go here for the atmosphere - bringing you back to smoking jackets and hanging out in the den. If this review is confusing, let's just say I've had mixed results when visiting this place."}
{"text":"Loved the setting, the sounds of water instead of traffic, the ambiance couldn't get much better.  The drinks were wonderful, food was not as spicy as we expected or hoped but still very tasty.  Excellent service too!  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Picked up some friends from the airport and needed some late night grub (plane arrived at midnight). Without a ton of options we ended up at Carlsbad and dug it immediately. Aside from a funky smell at the indoor bar everything was excellent. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed ourselves immensely. 

3 stars just for being open and serving food until 2 am. 

1 extra star for the steak quesadilla (recommended on yelp!) and the tacos and beans - all were beyond excellent. 

The last star has to do with the drink order. One of our party can not handle sweetness in her drinks, so she asked for a margarita with Patron, just a squeeze of lime and salt. Not too sweet. The waitress responded with \"oh, basically a skinny rita? Sure\".  The other three of us ordered Skinny-ritas as well and a conversation before the drinks arrived braced us for disappointment - we all thought we would get four regular skinny ritas. But it didn't happen - three normal and one as requested made for the perfect start to a weekend visit.

Take away: Sometimes its the simple stuff - like getting a drink order right the first time. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Different kind of mexican food with a great atmotsphere, especially on the patio Service is always a little less tha excellent when busy. But overall our favorite maexican"}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices. Great atmosphere. Most everything is in the spicy side so beware. I would go again"}
{"text":"I have been here several times...my goto is either the chili relleno or the habernero burger...depending on ny mood.  The relleno is stuffed with carnitas and smothered in hatch green chili...awesome.   the burger has chopped haberneros cooked right into the meet and then covered with sliced haberneros....hot but oh so tasty."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not great.  Too much emphasis on heat rather than flavor.  The service was solid, except we shouldn't have had to ask for re-fills.

Won't be back not because it's bad, but because there's too much great out there to waste time with good."}
{"text":"first off i just love the atmosphere, so cool that it had a waterfall and the walk up entrance is like you're entering a cavern on a wooden ramp, awesome!! n then there are hanging bats from the ceiling, so cute!! I had to go all out and try the enchantment platter which consisted of chili releanos, a blue avodaba burrito, and tamale ...to top it off delicious red and green sauce covered the delectables as well as melted cheese mmm, with tasty black beans on the side 
....the highlight of the evening had to have been when my dad, new to places reviewed by yelp was in awe of his chimichanga and had proclaimed it was by far the best he had ever had!!! what a night :D"}
{"text":"This food was amazing. I had one of the specials for the evening, scallops in a sauce that was to die for. Really indescribable as I couldn't identify what flavored I was tasting. But it was wonderful. Another person had the filet salad which they said was great. Another had a plate with chili rellenos and two other items. Was really spicy hot and good.  Don't understand some of the negative reviews here. Almost like we were in different places. Plan to go again before we leave town"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really impressed with this little place!  I'm kind of surprised to read he run negative reviews because our experience was quite the opposite.  Flavorful food, fun drinks, accommodating staff, awesome atmosphere.  Best of all, very minimal Scottsdale douche-baggery!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oh, if only we lived closer to this place. We saw them featured on Check Please Arizona, and my husband grew up in New Mexico and misses that good, zesty food.

We arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday and had our pick of the seating. Fantastic, cozy atmosphere in the dining room. Our waitress was fast and courteous--really, perfect service. I used the Yelp check-in to get the free chips and salsa. Delicious stuff--loved both salsas.

Since it was happy hour time, we order ala carte as a family: brochettes, grilled chicken quesadilla, habanero sliders,and New Mexican potstickers. The brochettes were primarily mine and they were awesome. Going back, I'd make that a meal all by itself. The chicken quesadilla was delicious, though the bottom was very crunchy and required the steak knife to cut through. The potstickers were great and not hot-hot but good flavor. I didn't sample the sliders because I can't handle the heat, but my husband loved those and the fries.

For dessert, we split the chocolate bread pudding as part of my Bread Pudding Quest. This was a solid entrant. The texture was perfect and the chocolate flavor in the bread was just right. I'm not crazy about butterscotch but it worked well here to add moisture and a touch of sweetness. It's not my favorite bread pudding but it's very good and I recommend it if you're a chocolaholic. 

I'm pretty sure next time we come here--and there will be a next time--my husband is determined we try the sopas."}
{"text":"Literally finishing up lunch with my dad here as I type and had such a great experience that I had to write a review before even getting up from the table! I've been here a handful of times in the past and the food has always been great but this time the food was exceptional. Pair that with exceptional service from our server (John B ) and a rave review was a must. I tried the newly added Las Cruces platter that John recommended and I wasn't disappointed. My dad had the stacked enchiladas and they were amazing as well. There was a slight mix up with our order but John took care of us and then some, and we couldn't have been more impressed! Very cool ambiance and they've got a fantastic patio for outdoor seating as well. Prices are a bit steep for my liking, so 4/5 stars - final rating."}
{"text":"Love this place for a casual lunch. The Tacos and Crab Cake are my favorites. Make sure you try their beans. They are to die for. They have great local selections in beer and nice wines by the glass. Their happy hour pricing is the best in the area!"}
{"text":"Food is always great.  Bathroom was disgusting.   Seat broke, things growing inside, and tp not in rack.  Kinda ruined the experience"}
{"text":"Great place for some New Mexican style food!! I had the Habanero cheeseburger and it was INSANELY HOT and delicious!!!!! It's one thing to just be hot...but this had awesome flavor!!! I highly recommend this burger...if you can handle it!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great twist to Mexican food!! They no longer have taco Tuesday - which is a really big down fall but I still come back to get their enchanted platter! The food is spicy and very unique. I've also tried the jalapeño marg and loved it- it has a great kick! The only reason I'm giving this place a four star is because they need to bring taco Tuesday back and have a better happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, but the prices are a little inflated. I used to come here a lot with my co-workers at lunch when I worked in the area, but not as often since I changed employers. I still want to come here because I love the habenero burger so, so much, but I'm a little iffy on spending $13 on a burger. I come occasionally when I'm not feeling cheap but I never have any regrets afterward. The drinks are also a little overpriced for how weak they make them. The fries are really, very good too and I really like the river running through the back patio. Gives your meal a great atmosphere. I also like to call ahead so I can pick it up and eat at home. The hostess and bartender are usually very personable and helpful. I would recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"It had been years since we had visited this location; upon a spur of the moment decision, my husband and I decided to drop in for dinner with our young son.  Upon entering, much to my surprise the place looked just about empty; then again it is a Tuesday night.  The host greeted us warmly and offered us a booth which we eagerly accepted.  Once seated, it was clear that the only positive experience of the visit was the host.

We sat for at least ten minutes without being acknowledged.  At first we patiently enjoyed one another's company as we all came in in good spirits.  Finally my husband asked the bartender (who was close by) who would be taking care of us.  The bartender graciously came over to take our drink order while we awaited our (absent) server.  We each ordered a margarita without salt, which he repeated back to us and then promptly brought two heavily salted margaritas.  At this point I was grateful just to get service and proceeded to wipe the salt off of the rim to enjoy my drink...That was until our absentee waiter, Tyler came over with a condescending smirk and absolutely no apologies.

When my husband asked him why it was that we had not been acknowledged, he actually leaned into my husband's personal space and smirked again and stated ver batem: \"What do you want me to do about it?\".  My husband politely replied that we simply wanted to place an order...His reply: \"Well I have a whole other dining room full of guests besides you.\" (followed by another smirk and again, leaning into my husband's personal space).

At that, we got up to leave.  We have now arrived at Los Sombreros where the ambiance is night and day.  Here too we have fond memories and yet have not revisited in years.  So far the service and food is above and beyond our expectations.  The entire staff has been more than warm and welcoming. (Review soon to follow).  Do yourself a favor and skip Carlsbad Taverns where there is a snooty feeling of entitlement amongst the supposed 'servers' and a complete lack of regard or decency in general. Take the short drive only a few minutes up the road to Los Sombreros where you are welcomed, treated and fed like family."}
{"text":"Love it! The food is good with a great deal of variety and the restaurant is very unique. They easily take larger groups of 8 and have plenty of seating. If you like spicy food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I wanted so bad to like this place and was really looking forward to trying it out after reading great reviews. We arrived on Mother's Day weekend and sat in a booth in the bar. Our server waited several minutes to greet us, and when he came over he complained that his replacement wasn't there yet and proceeded to spit (like you do when you stick your tongue out and blow) on the table. Although he seemed to be joking and announced he'd be taking care of us, I wasn't impressed at all. It was obvious we were keeping him there late when he proceeded to answer one word answers about the menu. When we got our drinks, there was a huge crack in my margarita glass I noticed after I had several sips. When I pointed it out to the bartender, she actually asked me if I wanted a different glass or if she should remake it...needless to say, I asked it be remade completely. The ambience of the restaurant was ok, the food was just ok, and all I can remember from my experience was feeling like an unwanted guest. I served and bartended my way through college so I'm pretty understanding. I won't be going back there, and with all the great Mexican places in old town, why would I?"}
{"text":"Came in with my bachelor party group during Happy Hour Saturday night, which was great because the drinks and appetizers (the potstickers and steak quesadilla) were the best part of the entire meal.

Entrees: Two of us had the chicken fried chicken- it was terrible. The chicken was hammered almost beyond recognition, and the chorizo gravy had no flavor. Seasoned with spice but almost zero salt (this was pretty much the theme for all the entrees- spiced up with chiles, but not salty or seasoned enough otherwise.)

The chimichangas that came out suffered from the same issue- the meat and stuffing weren't seasoned almost at all, and all that came through was the chili taste. The rock shrimp tacos were so poorly seasoned, my friend took one bite and took the rest home in a box :(

Wouldn't ever go back, unless they improved the menu. Cool place and good service, but the food was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"We visited Carlsbad Tavern with a group of 14 and had the pleasure of sitting outside on a beautiful evening.  Although the restaurant does not normally provide separate checks, the manager agreed to do it for us upon request when setting up our reservation.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and efficient, assisting us in making good choices from the menu.  The food was amazing.  Just spicy enough, with great taste and a little (or a lot) of bite.  I had the brochette from the appetizer menu along with a cup of their fantastic green chili mac and cheese.  Both were excellent.  High marks for awesome wait staff, pleasant surroundings, interesting menu and great food!"}
{"text":"We drive by all the time and finally decided to stop and check it out.  Really glad we did!  The employees are awesome, the food is delicious and the ambience is perfect.  I had the meatloaf and my wife got the lobster enchiladas.  Our server made sure we were taken care of and kept our glasses full.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty heavy and not very flavorful. 
Good service and cool environment, just wasn't super into the food."}
{"text":"The patio is super cute and doesn't fee like you're in the middle of Scottsdale. Cavern's chicken salad is good and so are the prickley pear margaritas. Good place for lunch, just be aware it's New Mexico style Mexican food and they have a tendency to put American cheese where it doesn't belong. When in doubt no cheese."}
{"text":"This place serves very good food. 

It is a interesting location. There is a waterfall in the outside dining area and a fake cake motif with bats on the ceiling. The tables and chairs are worn in a pleasant way. 

We went twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. The service was inconsistent. Our dinner waiter was not friendly or very attentive but the rest of the staff was great. Our lunch waiter was good and he was pulling double duty as the Host.

The food selection is fantastic. Lots of variety for a Mexican Restaurant. The dishes are inventive and there are so many that I wished I could have tried. All the portions are fairly generous.

The Osso Buco that I had was excellent. The sauce and potatoes it came with were also very good.

For lunch I had the award winning Habanero Burger. It wasn't cooked as I had ordered. They cooked it well and I asked for medium. However, it was still very good and the fries are excellent. The only downside was that the fresh chopped Habanero is not very much fun a few hours later when it's on its way out.

I really want to go back and try more of the varied fair. They have many green chile dishes, steaks, and seafood. They all sound and look great. I they could improve the service they would get the 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Go to Carlsbad for quality food, late-night or earlier. The servers are friendly and they're ready with beer. Unfortunately we weren't cautioned of the size of our foursome's order.

All dishes are of large, if not massive, quantity. The nachos with chicken fed four of us, such that only I could finish my entree after a lot of face-stuffing of their good burger."}
{"text":"Oh Carlsbad... I have mixed feelings. Service isn't always amazing but they seem like real people which I enjoy. I love that they're open late, and the food is always amaze balls and they give you a fairly large side portion. Drinks off menu are great and booze is a plenty in the cocktails. However my waiter was too busy to make my drink and then it didn't come in the traditional glass, I'm a stickler for by the book drinks. Plus, I was overcharged nearly $3 for my food, that's serious, a little bit here and there could be a lot. Although I'll keep coming back. Patio is to die for, during the summer it's great but wear bug spray because the water attracts mosquitoes."}
{"text":"I've been playing catchup with many of friends and no better way to get together than over a good meal and drinks. 

One the main reasons we hit up Carlsbad is because it's my buddy's local spot and our meetup location for some night bicycle riding with dinner and drinks to follow. 

They have a good discounted happy hour after 10pm. The crowd numbers can be seasonal so a lot of times it's pretty empty, but service is really good and prompt to accommodate. I don't think I've eaten outdoors but the patio area is nice and ideal when the weather cools to have a nice size group meeting.

This trip, I went away from my usual hamburger & fries (which I've done many times in the past) and went for the Fish & Chips. It came with this salsa salad on the side... I didn't mess with it but my buddy said it was good. Nice batter, texture and crunch for the fish and a few Moscow Mules to top it off. 

Future visits are planned and will look to expand my choices with the menu as they are 'New Mexican Cuisine restaurant'"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great food! Machaca beef chimmi and green chili Mac was delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was probably the 6th time here and each time I get something different. Past favorites of ours are the Green Chile Stew (only the Hombres eat this), Great Tortilla Soup,  Enchiladas are nummy.    My husband and I split an order if (2) Crab Stuffed Poblanos and though I found a rather 'light' crab flavor, it was very tasty. The pepper appeared dipped in a coating that was spicy without being hot...not a bad thing as too hot and I'd not have tasted the crab at all. Their black beans are great and my husband gave a thumbs-up on the Margarita.  And as always, the wait staff is excellent. The patio, which is outstanding, was 3/4 full at 10:00 pm (after a trip to SMIL) and I always had a full glass of iced tea, the food came quickly.  The staff was very busy but kept everyone happy.  Nice job, Carlsbad!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the bar atmosphere and ate outside. The food was fairly spicy for me but we enjoyed it overall. We enjoyed the green Chile the best by itself. The meatloaf was good but very spicy."}
{"text":"Man, did anyone else get hit by that powerful hail-tastic burst of heavy rain yesterday? I was driving to Carlsbad Tavern when the clouds unleashed buckets upon buckets of rain on my car. By the time I got there the rain had subsided to a drizzle and it made for the absolute perfect atmosphere as I walked up the wooden planks into the cave-like atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.

But then I looked to the right and saw an empty lagoon with tchotchke plastic turtles and fish upended and scattered atop PVC pipes in the concrete enclosure. I can accept the fact that they wouldn't keep that filled during the summer though. It's a waste of water with all the evaporation, although I'd really like to come here when the waterfall moat thingy is functioning because it looks like it would be great ambiance for a fun dinner!

I got there 15 minutes late and ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for my mom and aunt to arrive (what can I say, we're a punctual family). So I sauntered up to the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt. Since it was on happy hour it cost me only $3.75 and was a smooth combination of tequila, triple sec and sweet and sour mix. For only four bucks this well concoction was one of the better margaritas in recent memory. Chile pepper lights around the bar with all sorts of bat related memorabilia managed to be campy fun rather than campy trashy and gave me plenty to observe as I was waiting.

Feeling like the traditional Mexican munchies, I ordered the tricolor chips with two salsas. This was an unfortunate choice. The salsa de casa was very coarsely chopped, which made it really hard to dip or spoon onto a chip, and was extremely heavy on tomatoes with few other discernable flavors. The tomatillo salsa tasted okay but was also chopped so coarsely it was like layering strips of tomatillo on chips. The chips weren't too bad, but they were reminiscent of oil they've been using to crisp chimichangas in for the past week. I've worked in food service and I know what old oil tastes like.

But the conversation with my aunt and mom more than made up for the disappointing appetizer, and it cost two whopping bucks so I totally got what I paid for, although it is a little disappointing that they don't come complimentary.

Once we were seated in the main dining room, I was pleased by the atmosphere and decor (stuffed bats hanging from the ceiling! high seat booths with comfy cushions! cool copper light fixtures! rock walls and a huge floor to ceiling rock feature with vegetation!), which managed to maintain a cave-like atmosphere while still being inviting. We placed our order with a very friendly server that was a natural at making small talk and joking around, instead of coming off as peeved that we were taking too long to examine The Daily Guano. I also liked the more open ended, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Rather than the usual leading questions like, \"Can I get you something to drink? Do you know what you want to eat?\"

I ordered the Enchantment Platter so I could try a little bit of everything, a chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito, a chile rellano and a sopapilla. When it came out I was pretty disappointed by the presentation. It was smothered in so much sauce and cheese that it was difficult to discern just what the hell I had on my plate and it looked like my burrito had anointed the surrounding items with a liberal splash of greasy red sauce. It most definitely could have done with two plates instead of just one. 

(I'll admit it. It really, really pissed me off. That gut reaction made me want to rate this place around 2 stars instead of 4. I have issues with food presentation. I rearrange every sandwich I order at a restaurant to ensure even distribution of ingredients. I don't care if things are touching and mixing it up, but it better be doing so in an aesthetic manner.)

But once I dug in it turned out to be a delicious meal! The chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was deliciously cheesy with huge chunks of chicken. The carne adovada was tender but relied a bit too heavily on some weird tomato flavor that was thickened with what tasted like cornstarch, solo it was weird, but when the burrito entrails leaked all over the place it added a delicious flavor to the meal. The chile rellano was pure pork and cheese, a dense and delicious concoction nested atop rice and black bean. Rice was generic, black beans were delish. And I've got enough leftovers for three lunches, all for only $12.95! 

Psst! Don't get the habenero burger unless you want to shit fire for the next week. I've heard that from so many people that it must be true! It's not served with a complementary glass of milk for no reason..."}
{"text":"This place is great. Service can be a little slow on the patio but otherwise the food is fantastic. The New Mexican pot stickers are amazing if you never had a highly suggest you try them. I always order the chimichanga even though everything else is great I cannot resist. Even typing this out makes me want to go eat one right now, dammit I gotta go."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! When we set out to have dinner last night we thought we knew what we wanted but this place blew our minds. Carlsbad Tavern has so much character, it's almost Disney-like. The patio has a waterfall and a cool outside atmosphere. Inside is very \"bat cave\" and I love it. I do wish there was a little more light in there (sometimes it was hard to see what I was eating) but I can move past all of that. 

Everyone is extremely friendly and quick to seat you. We were able to get a very private booth which was nice on a busy Friday night. 

Lets get to the food. AMAZING! The chips and salsas (thats right, two yummy salsas) are a must have. These things are to die for! My boyfriend had the Enchantment Platter and he said it was exactly that. I had the new Veggie Enchiladas and they were very good. I picked some of the spinach out cause it seemed like too much.....  but maybe I'm just picky?? We had some hot and very fresh sopaipillas with honey for dessert. YUMMMM!!!

Our waiter delivered excellent service and was always checking on us.
I did hear some of the wait staff complaining about a tip someone left him last week. Not very professional. But I've been a server and I know how it is. Keep the complaints for after work.

Our experience was excellent and we found ourselves asking why we don't come here more often. Believe me.... we will!!!"}
{"text":"I was going to call this place a bad rip off of Richardson's and chastize it for being so, until the owner told me she used to work for him and \"proudly stole\" some of his concepts. Whatever, I don't care as long as your food is good. 

Ordered the Carne Adovada... bland, dry, and boring. Other diners at the table had similar sentiments about their food. Chips and salsa shared at the table was more what I'd expect to find in New York City. No spice, no flavor, and runny as all get out. I guess I should expect all of this lack of flavor and spice, as this place is obviously appealing to tourists who aren't used to our spices. This was further proved by the goofy bats all over, the fake caves, and the awful service which is so typical of a tourist trap.

TOURIST TRAP. Avoid if you're a local. If you're from the Midwest or East Coast, you'll find it charming."}
{"text":"This place is excellent New Mexican cuisine! I especially love the new mexican potstickers and am obsessed with the cream sauce that it comes with! The lobster enchiladas are also to die for!!!"}
{"text":"The food used to be real good here, like for the last year or so it's been slipping.  The food was awesome and the staff was cool. Well the staff is still good but the place has declined.  Last I spoke to the staff they blamed the owner for using a cheaper supplier."}
{"text":"I enjoyed HH Nachos, Steak Tacos, Crab Cakes, Crispy French Fries and of course their UNBELIEVABLE Fried Ice Cream & Chocolate Bread Pudding (which I don't even usually like but this was bread that tasted like chocolate instead of chocolate on bread so WOW) 
Great specials, Good enough service.
I am so glad I took the advice of whoever told me it was the best Mexican Food in Scottsdale. I was impressed. 
I did not have time to take photos, I was too hungry and the food was too delicious.
Getting used to Southwest Fare where black beans are on all \"Mexican Food\" is different but I'm game. In KY you also have everything is \"Queso AKA Cheese Dip\" so the fat white girl in me misses that but again, I can adjust."}
{"text":"You have to sit outside to get the best experience from this place. It quirky and cute while you sit on either side of the moat running through the exterior. I really liked their chips and salsas. The season their chips and I'm a spicy girl that LOVES mexican food so I was a big fan on this original take on the fried tortilla. Try the Lobster Croissant sandwich concoction and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Ugh. Just don't go. Dirty. Found a hair in my food. Need I go on? Ok... I will. Ordered their signature pork dish. It was literally floating in grease. I've never seen anything like it and I grew up on Georgia! Found a long black curly hair in my rice. Hubby found a hair in his guacamole. After seeing 4 stars on Yelp we figured it was worth trying. Not sure if it used to be cool or what. We will never go back. Totally disgusting."}
{"text":"Awesome patio. Passable New Mexican cuisine. I like that they offer local and craft beer selections."}
{"text":"Food and fun!

A great place to grab some grub, have a drink, and hang for a few hours. The atmosphere is unique and cave-like, plus they have a huge patio with fireplaces and a bar.

The Habenero burger is a true test  of your manhood..."}
{"text":"Nice place, server was fine and food was what I'd hoped, decent. Not exactly hopping on a Thursday night, was hoping for a bit more atmosphere. Overall decent place to grab dinner. Beers on tap seemed a bit limited (about 6)."}
{"text":"Definitely have had better!  Arizona is probably one of the few states that you can find AMAZING Mexican food and this place is NOT ONE OF THEM. 

The actual restaurant was adorable and had a great outdoor patio. The margaritas were good but nothing special and my meal (Blue Enchiladas) were just alright.  Any Mexican restaurant that doesn't start out with complimentary chips and salsa is just LAME to me."}
{"text":"Its a tourist place, unique restaurant theme of being in a cave. Outside patio has a large waterfall, kind of expected to see a mini golf area with the theme going on. Food was ok, I am not giving a bad review, just not my type of dining experience. Server was tired, he spilled a little of a beverage while setting it and half heartedly cleaned it up leaving us to finish the job.
All in all great restaurant for kids."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, accommodating kitchen, clean restaurant with an great outside seating setup make this place an awesome place to dine and chill with friends and family. The enchiladas are my favorite here. The chips and salsa tasted great and fresh."}
{"text":"Stephanie was our server and was outstanding!! This is my favorite restaurant and I've been coming here for about two years. Im a vegetarian and am obsessed with the veggie enchiladas. My stomach always hurts afterwards and I never knew why but it was always worth it so I never asked questions. Come to find out their rice is made with chicken stock (which is normal) but she was the first waitress to tell me that without my mentioning being a 13 year vegetarian. She said she had a hunch and thought she should tell me beforehand. Now I know! Their rice is amazing, by the way. Just don't get it if you're a veggie. Or do and deal with the stomach ache because it's worth it, hah. Anyway, it was so thoughtful of her to proactively mention that. The veggie enchaladas are absolutely amazing and so is the green chili mac and cheese that I got. Drinks-wise I got the Miracle on Hayden and asked for the jalapeno to be added. Amazing. I love it here!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Carlsbad for years and it is one of my favorite places in the valley. I have read a lot of the reviews and one thing is noticeably absent and that is any  comments on their Tortilla Soup.  It is the best in the valley as far as I am concerned. 

Another thing I have noticed a lot of previous reviews have mentioned is the water feature.  Some like it, some don't.  It may be helpful for some people who have not lived in valley for a long time to know that in it's previous life the building that Carlsbad Tavern now occupies was once a seafood restaurant called Pier De' New Orleans or something like that.  You can vaguely see as you walk into the restaurant the old motif of a seaside pier, and the bow of the boat was the main dining room.  So Carlsbad Tavern inherited the water feature and kept it as part of their dinning experience.  I like it and just wanted to shed some light for anyone who might find it odd or out of place."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has 4 stars on here. To begin with, I think the outside of the restaurant sets false expectations as to what you shall find once on the inside. The entrance of the restaurant is delightful with a beautiful patio, running waters, a mini lake/river, romantically lit up at night making it look like you are about to enter into a devine culinary experience. Once on the inside, the restaurant is dark and dingy, divided into two parts: a bar area with enormous booths, and a dinky room with fake wildlife where more booths and tables are. We were lucky enough to sit by the dinky wildlife/fake mountainside/faux cave where there were still last years halloween decorations up. My personal favorite was the bats. And to top it all off, it was incredibly dark in there, adding to the dark and dingy halloween theme they have going on.

If the ambience isnt enough to kill your appetite, the food sure is. We got two entrees: steak tacos (from the appetizers section) and a trio platter (one of the supposed \"favorites\" according to the trippy waiter) with the chile rellenos, enchilada, and burrito. Lets start with the steak tacos: personally I think Taco bell tacos are superior to what I ate. The steak inside was cold. On to the platter: first of all you could not physically distinguish which was which without the help of the waiter pointing out each item due to the amount of sauce on top of the whole dish. Better yet, my taste buds couldn't distinguish the difference between each dish because it all just tasted like generic mexican flavored mush.

Usually yelp reviews and star ratings are really legit, don't know how this one has escaped that. You're better at off at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always right on the money. The blue corn enchiladas are my favorites. The margaritas are always good. The service is pretty good too. I enjoy sitting outside when weather permits. Great little place to bring out of town visitors too, especially if they like spice!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Nothing is fresh. Do not go here if you are interested in eating good food. This is a place to go with 'bros and chicks\" I guess. It's a sports bar in disguise.
I don't know why it has such high ratings. Rice-undercooked. Chips-store bought. Beans- worse than canned Trader Joes. The only saving grace was the jalapeno cucumber margarita-but even that was mediocre."}
{"text":"Love this local restaurant/bar. The staff is always friendly and remember your favorites after you have been there a few times.  Anything with their green chili is amazing. The jalapeño mashed potatoes are delicious.  If you feel like something spicy try the habanera burger, it can set your mouth on fire. 
The patio is great for both warm summer nights and chilly winter evenings.  The place is dimly lit which adds to the bat cave ambiance."}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich and it was amazing! Had jalapeño bacon and chipotle mayo, which gave it an extra kick, but was not overwhelming. Even the chips have seasoning on them to make the chips and salsa even more delicious! My husband and mother-in-law both had the platter which had the chile relleño, chicken enchilada, and pork burro. They both loved it! I got to try a bite of their sopapilla, and it was phenom! I can't wait to try more on the menu. Also, great service!"}
{"text":"First time here, so glad we stopped in.  Connor was our server and gave great recommendations I had the Carl's chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had the enchantment platter.  Connor was awesome and attentive.  The patio is really cute complete with water features and cool decor.  Music is on point too.  5 stars for Carlsbad Tavern"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for brunch, on a Sunday, on account of an email I received, for half off between 10 am- 11 am. Reservation for 3 @ 10 am.  Server was very friendly, attentive, really nice!  The food unfortunately lacked in what I remembered when I was last @ this restaurant many years ago. The meatloaf my friend and I both ordered was very salty. The Benedict another friend ordered, she said, was just ok.  Didn't realize until I left, when I looked @ my receipt, was charged full price, as oppose to 1/2 brunch.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the food has always been great and they offer a fair selection of different margaritas.  The service is attentive but not overbearing.  We dined once inside and once outside earlier in the year.  Our check-in on Yelp qualified us for comped chips and salsa which is worth trying.  Been there, done that and have the T-shirt to prove it."}
{"text":"Right in our neighborhood... Walked in at 6pm. Quickly sat. Prompt service by Hannah. Unique & fun \"newspaper\" menus. Food came out quickly. Best enchiladas in town. Great service throughout.... just ordered fried ice cream (I'm sure it will be as amazing as Hannah described). See you soon Carlsbad Tavern! 

Update- been here a few times since our great service with Hannah. Other times we've had great service and food from other staff here. 

Tonight Elizabeth was not your best server. When asking if the Seafood Pasta special that was on the board was available, her response was \"I don't know I just got here\" with hands in the air. Followed by her going to the back and never returning to answer the question. 

Fast forward to getting our food. Food delivered all by Elizabeth which is great in my book. But when all food and drinks were delivered, there was never any words... took over 10 minutes for her to even walk by our table after that (had to ask another staff member for mayo/'mustard).

They must pool tips here because she clearly doesn't up-sell and try to get her check average up. Margarita empty and no \"would you like another?\"... I had to ask for another as she was running away...

She lost you a star this time, Carlsbad. Your food and drinks will keep us coming"}
{"text":"Fun building to be in and great, fresh mexican food.  This place is off the main strip of old town but worth the detour."}
{"text":"Went with a tour group.  I don't understand how they can rate 4 stars.  Staff could not keep our orders straight. My green chili stew was mediocre at best and my carne adovada tasted burnt.  They should change the name to Carl's Bad Tavern."}
{"text":"I am from New Mexico and this is as close to home as I've ever tasted! The food is delicious the staff is amazing and the ambience is welcoming and inviting."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the worst experiences I have ever had in my lifetime of 27 years. I came in around 10 pm trying just to order some quick tacos and enchiladas. Our waiter asked us if we wanted a drinks. Not wanting any originally, we decided to get a margarita and Moscow mule. We ordered three chicken tacos and the blue corn enchiladas.
After about ten minutes, he asked us what our order of food was. We repeated the order back to him. 20 minutes go by and we are asked if we need more drinks. \"During the waiting he sat at our table to talk about he world series game.\" Another 20 minutes go by and we are asked again if we need more drinks. Finally we ask if we have food coming after watching all the tables around us get served their order. He says yes we do. 5 minutes later he comes back and tells us the kitchen lost our order and he doesn't remember what we ordered from him at all. He couldn't remember the two simple things we ordered twice!!!Disgrace to the food industry. We left at 11:10 pm. Hungry to say the least! Never seen anything like it before in my life."}
{"text":"A very nice burger. Got to love the weird ambience of this cave-like setting. The music is bluesy and pleasant. My guess is the beer flows freely here on weekends, but lunchtime is another more enjoyable thing. The chipotle mayo is a star; lots of nice kick; be sure to try it."}
{"text":"My husband had heard of this place from a co-worker of his. New Mexican? I had no idea. So is it Mexican food made in a \"new\" way? Or food from New Mexico? I wasn't sure.
We got to the parking lot and I must say, I was immediately turned off. Cheesy decor outside and even cheesier decor on the inside. It smelled like if they just cleaned the place down, so I couldn't smell any food, only flowers and botanical junk.
We decided to stay anyway. The menu wasn't appealing at all, but maybe it was because I was already turned off. I ordered the fajita quesadilla (i think that's what it was called) and the Tequila shrimp. To my surprise they were both very very good. Very well seasoned for both dishes. 
I had also tried the house made sangria. Skip it, it tastes like hawaiian punch. Way too sweet.
All in all, the food we had was good. If you are in the neighborhood and your expectations are not high go ahead and try it. But if your dining experience includes decor and ambience, then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  

1. Its really big and the outside seating is badass... a little canal with a bridge you need to walk across, outdoor bar, quite isolated from busy Hayden Road... feels like you are on a neighbors back porch. 

2. The menus look like newspapers.  Enough said. 

3.  The food is pretty good.  Spicy enough.  Had the Enchantment Platter and it was awesome! Totally recommend it ... get to sample some of the best stuff on the menu all in one entree.  Margaritas are pretty good there too. 

4. Service is good.  Everyone I've ever encountered is really friendly and efficient.  

5.  The place as a physical structure is rad.  It feel like you are entering an Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. A rough and tumble stone facade archway leads you up a ramp to the entrance.  Fake bats dangle from it.  A little waterfall, bridge... but no snake pit :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great dining experience tonight. Stephanie was our server and she was super friendly and made sure to check on us plenty of times. Our drinks were never empty and our food came out very quickly. The rotisserie chicken was amazing and the veggie enchiladas tasted super fresh. I will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"I liked the outside seating although it is too hott for me to try it. Free chips and salsa with checking in over yelp was nice, the server wasn't the most impressive as she had a serious case of resting bitch face. Shared tacos during happy hour and they were really good. However 8.00 on a happy hour menu for three small tacos was a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Meh. OK.  We went for my son's going away dinner and there were 6 of us. First be warned that they will add the gratuity so don't double tip the way my husband did - they were nice enough to take it off after we left and realized.  

Generally the food was fair to good.  The highlight was the scones.  I ordered a red burrito that the waitress highly recommended - it was not even at all good.  Some of the family got good entrees and others had my experience.  I was disappointed because I've been really wanting to try this place.

The restaurant itself was really cute and I bet the courtyard in the winter is awesome.  It was far too hot for us to try it out in July unfortunately."}
{"text":"A neighborhood favorite! Everything on the menu is delicious but the stacked enchiladas are at the top of my list. Margaritas are great as well! Sit outside if it's not too hot, it's got a great front patio with a fun water feature and bistro lights."}
{"text":"The best Carne Adobada plate I've outside of New Mexico.

I've tried most of the NM restaurants in this state and this one makes the best Adobada. For sure.

Not nearly as nice as Richardsons or Dicks Hideaway but the Adobada plate is better. That's all I can really say.



Service was so so and we sat at a table in the bar that has seen better days."}
{"text":"Great quality food especially for the price, excellent service by our server James H. I haven't had such good service from a server in a long time, he's fantastic and it made my mine and my girlfriends evening even better.. Thanks James.. Oh and I must recommend the Cowboy Meatloaf. Super good and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for work and was craving something from the southwest. Carlsbad had great Yelp reviews. I was surprised as about everything in my experience was the opposite of what I'd read on yelp. The service was actually good. The bartender, I think his name was Louie, was very friendly. The food was mediocre at best; it kind of reminded me of airport Mexican food. The green chile isn't the same time of green chile I'm used to in Denver. This green chile was more like a salsa, not the stew/roux I've become familiar with in the southwest. My experience was fine, but not close to good enough to bother with Carlsbad again."}
{"text":"It's a campy atmosphere but that makes it fun! Don't change! The food was delicious and plentiful. Need to go more often."}
{"text":"Thank you Liz for the great service and best drink makin' ever!!! Your the best!! Can't complain about one single staff member here ever! Fun times!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here about 6 months ago. The outdoor patio is great! We had a few beers and dinner... don't remember exactly what I had but we both enjoyed our New Mexican food in AZ. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner thurs 8/17. Casual place, attentive service and the food I felt was a good value. 

While the individual plate price might seem high, its not when you consider the quality of the food which I felt was above par and on target for value. 

I had the enchanted platter, corny name but serious food. fatguy two adipose thumbs up. 

Wife had the pork loing with a really incredible jalapeno risotto.

I say go and enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Wrong food and cold food. My guess vomited after the appetizer.  Furthermore 2 guys at the bar were smoking. What happen to our in door no smoking law. This was our first and last time. Waiter was very nice though.

Update : both got sick. Hopefully, no one else will get as sick as us."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with coworkers.  I only got a salad which was big (especially for the \"small\" lunch portion), filling, and good.  Everyone else's food looks and smelled good and they liked it too.  We also ordered some tortilla chips as an appetizer which were really good.  I wish I had more of an appetite for some of their other food.  If I come back to Scottsdale and want some Mexican food, I'll come back here."}
{"text":"not much i can say after 99 reviews..thought i would give my two cents anyways. we visited carlsbad tavern located in scottsdale last saturday. as you walk in there is a cool water fountain in the front.  inside it's dark and has a unique cave like feel inside. 

i appreciated that they have an extensive wine list! i went with a refreshing clean slate riesling.  for my entree i ordered snapper tacos. it was a safe choice since i love fish.  mr h ordered the carne adovada (slow roasted pork) burrito for his entree. i was amazed that he could tolerate such a high spice level!  i had just one bite of his burrito and it was burning my mouth so much that i ended up gulping my riesling. as other reviewers mentioned they do charge 2.99 for chips and salsa! i agree it's a ripe off but at least the chips are warm and the salsa was fresh and delicious. overall an outstanding place for folks who like heat in their food."}
{"text":"Yay a new place to add to my list of good grub and a menu that makes me want to come back several times to try out more.

My girlfriend and I went for dinner last night and had a great meal.  She got the chile rellano plate and I got a filet salad.  Yes I know I just said salad but it had filet mignon on it and jalapeno bacon.  I mean come on it's not healthy especially with the chipotle ranch dressing on it.  It was just what I needed.  I had a bite of the chile rellano and I thought they were good as well.  

Like I said there were many other things on the menu that I for sure want to try so I will be back and hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Food was alright. I was really stoked to try this place because of the great reviews, but I wasn't too impressed. The server was very nice, drinks were good, food was average."}
{"text":"Not as great as we had hoped, heard and read. 
A couple of my girlfriends and I came here for Brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was noon but still cookin up brunch meals. I was happy bout that since I was excited about tryn their Chilaquiles. They also had a Bloody Mary bar going on but since I'd had my fill of drinks the night before at the Chandler Craft Drinks Festival I decided to give my liver a rest and not partake. 
A friend and I order the chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. My other gal pal ordered the eggs Benedict w chorizo sausage patty. We wait. 
Not long after our food comes. It does not look very pretty. The filet minon strips were way over cooked. The beans looked dry and the main course, chilaquiles looked like a slop of mashed up, over cooked enchiladas. Eggs weren't mixed in they were on the side. Ok so whatever it doesn't look good. I can get past that if it tastes good. Well it didn't. The chilaquiles tasted like a spicy masa (over cooked and mashed up corn tortillas). For those of you that don't know chilaquiles is diced up corn tortillas pan fried to a light crisp w eggs and enchilada sauce, meat added optional. What was presented was not at all what I was expecting or used to. My friend was so disappointed that she requested chips to substitute her need for a lil crunchy tortilla. Plus she was even more upset because the menu clearly stated that it came with queso fresco and crema (sour cream) and it came with neither.  I check in to take advantage of the free chips and salsa offer. We ate what we could muster, which wasn't much. However my friend that ordered the Benedict loved it!
The waitress was kind enough to take our chilaquiles dishes off our bill. I should've known better than to eat out at a Mexican food place. I'm always disappointed. Nobody cooks like moms. 

The place it's self is cute. A lil dark inside which is nice during the summer heat days."}
{"text":"\"A good spicy challenge strikes a balance between flavor and fear.\"?Adam Richman

Carlsbad Tavern (CT) is a curious anomaly in the Yelp world; they're listed as \"Mexican,\" but they're far from your average Mexican, or Tex-Mex joint. They're actually their own genre known as New Mexican Cuisine which relies heavily on the New Mexico's State Vegetable: the Chile Pepper*. Being a Spice-Crazed Pepper Head, CT is right up my alley as almost every dish here has some kind of fresh or dried Chile incorporated into it. CT was actually the very first place I ate when visiting AZ, and has become my go-to spot whenever I'm in town. Now, let's get to the food!

Habanero Cheeseburger- The 2009 Food Network Magazine \"Burger of AZ\" comes with the special caveat of \"You order it, you own it\"--because the spice level on this dish is pretty extreme. They mix in Habanero Chili Powder into the freshly-ground beef and top it with some spicy Jalapeño Jack Cheese. It's a good thing it comes with a side salad because you'll need it to help cool down your mouth as the heat continues to build in your mouth. The burger itself is excellent with a pillowy soft bun, perfectly-cooked beef and spicy goodness made this the best burger I'd had in a good while! Spice Level 8 out of 10!  

Green Chile Mac & Cheese- One of my favorite dishes here at CT, as the creamy, melted cheese and seasoning of \"Christmas\" Chiles makes this another Chile Heads dream. The fresh Jalapeño flavor really stands out in this dish. Spice level 4 out of 10.  

Prickly Pear Caramel Flan- Words can't describe how amazingly good this Flan is! It's so decadent that it melts in your mouth and coats your tongue in a tantalizing array of creamy, sweet and velvety softness that you'll keep wanting more. They should call this dish \"Desert Crack.\"  Spice Level 0

Service & Ambiance- As CT's name suggests, the restaurant is a homage to the famous New Mexican Caves, and the décor throughout is representative. It's kitschy, cheesy and gauche--but I love it! Bat posters, Chile Pepper light strings, metal Bats and an awesome waterfall are just a few of the things you'll see at CT! It's done in a fun, tongue-in-cheek kinda way and you can tell they don't take themselves too seriously here which is to be admired. I highly recommend dining al fresco here, as the patio is much more inviting than the dark interior. The service here is always impeccable, and my last trip was no different. Our waitress (I wish I could remember her name) was amazing--kept my iced tea full, got our orders right and had a great attitude and sense of humor.

Value- Pretty standard AZ pricing of around $10-15 for an entrée, but the quality ingredients makes this a good value in my opinion.

CT is a must go for any Pepper Head and for anyone else looking for a delicious meal in a clean, comfortable and fun environment. Highly recommended for spicy goodness--and that Flan!! *swoon*    

*While a Chile Pepper is technically a fruit, culinarily speaking it is considered a vegetable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Carlsbad last night. It really is one of our favorite places. We typically sit at the bar..alright, who am I kidding? We always sit at the bar. 
Why? Because the service it outstanding. Matt & Jacob were working last night- we always have such a great time with them. The conversation, the drinks, the food. It's like our home away from home. 

My husband had the Surf & Turf and I had a bite of the filet and the shrimp and both were supremely delicious! The filet was cooked to perfection and smothered in shitake mushrooms. To. Die. For. 
He ate everything on his plate. I thought he was going to lick it clean. 
(Thankfully, he knows better).

I'm dieting. I had a salad with no dressing and ate the whole thing. Really. A salad with no dressing and I still ate it all! Plus they didn't roll their eyes when I brought in my diet tonic. And believe me, I deserved at least an eye roll.

This is what I really wanted to share with you. During the month of September they have 1/2 priced food items from their late night menu. 12AM - 2AM Sunday through Thurs
HALF PRICE! The sliders were already a screaming delicious deal and now they're half off.  
There is a God and he loves me! Loves me to eat  Half price Sliders. AMIRITE?!"}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing New Mexico styled dinner at Carlsbad Tavern.  The Carne Adovada and tri-colored tortilla encrusted Chilled Relleno was the best I've ever had.  Don't tell my grandma but they blow hers out of the water...hehe.  The Prickly Pear Margarita was absolutely delish, and the waitstaff was more than accommodating."}
{"text":"Ok I'm old. But this place is dark. So dark you can't read the menu. So I pull out my phone and use it as a light. We started off with the potstickers. They were a bit burnt so they started off on the wrong foot.  I ordered the filet salad. I enjoyed it. Couldn't see when I had eaten the good stuff so that was a negative. My husband had the green chile cheeseburger. He enjoyed it. We'll go back. During the day. They have windows so we'll be able to see!! We'd like to sit outside too. It looks nice to sit around the moat. ;-)"}
{"text":"Super special place in my heart. 

Cool bar / restaurant (literally) for those HOT Scottsdale afternoons evenings. 

Delicious food. The green chili cheeseburger is the best burger I've ever had in my life. Ever! No joke!!!

Habanero burger is as advertised - it's FING CRAZY HOT!!! Two bites and I tapped out. I love spice but holy crap that was insane. 

Green Chili Stew will cure any hangover. 

I've had almost everything on the menu and nothing disappoints. 

Sunday bloody bar... 

Great place every day of the week. I only wish there was something like it in San Francisco."}
{"text":"This place was such a wonderful experience.  My husband and I went here on Cinco de Mayo.  The ambiance is amazing, the food is yummy (but spicy), and the chips and salsa are AMAZING.  You won't regret going here!!"}
{"text":"Def gotta check this place out. I was visiting and got lucky and was able to sit outisde on a October Night. Outside setup is pretty cool in the night time. I can see how it looks cheesy in the day time. 


Food: 

Mac & Cheese was excellent, and the green chile in the food was amazing. The stacked enchiladas was excellent as well. Food was a great temperature and flavor was well above par."}
{"text":"This place has the best dish of all time... Blue corn enchiladas. You can never go wrong when ordering this delicious treat. I've come to Carlsbad many many times and I always order the same dish. The food is consistent and the patio is perfect for date night. Be careful when sitting outside when it's hot out because of the Mosquitos. Those lil suckers bite me every time. You can subside the annoying pain with more margaritas."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i did a 24-hour stint in Scottsdale last weekend and were craving Mexican food.  I found Carlsbad Tavern and decided to give it a try.  

Granted, like most eating experiences...i peeped out the menu before hand.  I already knew what I was going to get:  an ala carte order of Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese and an ala carte order of Veggies.  I love green chile (i think New Mexico when i see green chile) so i requested a side order of green chile to go with my order.  

Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese:  This was yummy.  It's served in a bowl lined with a large flour tortilla.  I knew i shoudn't have touched the flour tortilla, but the cheese was soaked through within the tortilla and after I took a bite of the tortilla.....it was gone quickly thereafter.  Okay, back to the Macaroni and Cheese.  I didn't notice a considerable amount of green chile, but luckily i requested a side, and i would put that over my mac and cheese as i was eating it.  With me, you can't go wrong with Mac and Cheese.  It was creamy and good.  I forced myself to NOT finish it...but as i type this review, i wish i had the left over so i can eat it now.  

Veggies:  The veggies was a meadly of onions, brocolli, carrots, zuchinni, mushrooms...i think that was it.  It was stir-fried or grilled, in some oil.  So although it may sound fairly healthy -- the oil was a FAIL.  it was good though.  It had to have been better than some of the other richly divine dishes.  

I'm sure they have a better crowd during happy hour and brunch.  But for me and my girlie...it was a good welcome to AZ straight from the airport."}
{"text":"After a long day at Taliesin West and Saguaro national park, I went here with a friend.  When I walked to the front door, I immediately thought the place looked like a miniature golf course replica, but maybe that is because I live in New England and our restaurants aren't as creative (except when there is a lobsta' on the roof!).  The decor inside was like a fun sports bar or Texas steakhouse restaurant, minus the peanut shells. Our waiter was nice and attentive.

We both ordered the Manchaca and tomatillo chimichanga.  Generally, I don't tend to order beef at any restaurant, except for the occasional Wendy's hamburger (I just love those square patties!).  The shredded beef was absolutely delicious.  The chimichanga was also served with rice and beans, which were fine, but the main dish stood out on its own.  If I am back in town and Carlsbad Tavern is still open, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I picked this for a group dinner destination based on all the great yelp reviews. The food here was embarrassingly bad and atmosphere kitschy. A year later, I'm still apologizing for dragging my friends there. I do not understand how this place has 4 stars!?"}
{"text":"This appears to mainly a local/neighborhood place and especially popular late night according to a local bartender. We didn't know that until after dining earlier in the evening on Fish Tacos and Osso Bucco. I thought both were good although the chef could lighten up on the white pepper in the chile mashed potatoes. I capped the meal with some flan which was very good. The service and ambiance on the patio with waterfall/misters made for a nice experience."}
{"text":"The prickly pair margarita is amazing! So are the chicken potsticker and green chiles - meet my expectation for spicy! Can't believe I waited nearly a year to check this place - cool outdoor yard really eases the hot summer time. Service is good."}
{"text":"I just visited this place on Valentines day with M, and was very pleased with the experience.

I'd never even heard of the place, and when she suggested it I looked it up online, found the website and decided it was a great idea.

The food is a New Mexican menu, complete with plenty of chilies in a lot of the dishes. The atmosphere on the outside look nothing what you experience inside. The bar looks comfy, and the patio (where we sat) is nice and intimate, plenty warm with the fireplace and heaters. The service was (mostly) attentive, only lacking at the point when we needed our server towards the end of our meal.

I had the Machaca & Tomatillo Chimichanga as my main course, M had the Portales Portobello Sandwich. Both were very good. The mushroom was a perfect tenderness, not too springy or chewy. The flavors were even, and the chipotle mayo a tad too spicy for M. My Chimi was tasty, the tortilla a nice combo of crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. The Machaca was flavorful and tender with a nice accent from the tomatillo. I was also impressed with the side dishes my meal came with. The rice was tender and light, with just the right amount of  slices and cheese (not too much of either). The black bean were cooked evenly and had a heat that comes up on you well after you've taken a bite.

I liked my experience, and look forward to going back again sometime."}
{"text":"The facility of this place is nothing to write home about.  It's an older building, a little cramped inside and not a lot of TVs or anything special.  But the food was awesome.  The carne adovada was as good as everyone says.  It's basically a pulled pork marinated in spices with cheese melted over the top.  It comes with rice and beans with cheese melted on it as well.  The food definitely has a kick to it.  I wanted to try the habenero burger but I was too scared.  Maybe next time. The service was good although it was slow, so I'm not sure if it's different if it's busy.  They have a huge outdoor seating area which was empty at the time we went.  I like the feel of the place, it's kind of divey but yet fun.  Worth stopping in if you like spicy food."}
{"text":"After being on my bookmark list for possibly years, I finally tried this place a few weeks back.... and it was good! The décor is a little hokey, what with it looking like a cave and being extremely dark, but it was cute. I went with my dad and we shared a green chili burger and a sampler plate (the enchantment platter) that had a chile relleno, enchilada, and a carne adovada burrito. The burger was so so... really nothing special and not a lot of heat there, but the enchantment platter.... that thing was huge, delicious, and covered in gooey cheese. There wasn't a bad item on it. Everything was spicy and flavorful, it makes me want another one as I type about it. There was more than enough food, so I had leftovers, which were equally delicious the next day. I'll be back. 


PS they have a great looking happy hour here, would love to go back and try that!"}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is not bad. It's not the greatest place for (New) Mexican Food..but, I've certainly had worse. It's a bit pricey and everything I've ordered has been \"o.k.\"
Green Chile Cheese Crisp was fair. The Chips and Two Salsas was alright and the Homemade Guacamole wasn't much to write home about. Even less impressive was the Tequila Shrimp. 
The ambiance is great, especially if it's cool enough to sit outside on the patio. The service has always been \"meh.\" It always seems like the servers have more important things to do and they're not very attentive. 
The best part of Carlsbad Tavern is the atmosphere..but, that's not enough to raise my review above 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food, margaritas, service and atmosphere!! We ordered the Chicken nachos and jalapeno sliders...both were delicious. We sat at the bar with some friends and the bartender was so very nice and personable!  They have a \"Carlsbad\" sauce the my husband LOVED and we even bought one to take home with us. This was our first visit, and will not be our last!"}
{"text":"I love this place!

The food is always amazing and hot. A few of my favorites are the green chile chicken quesadilla, caso nachos(both are appetizers), the Cavern chicken salad, and the fried ice cream.

The staff is friendly and fun, they do a great job with joking around while still doing an amazing job!

Also, the owner Andrew, is super great. He always has a smile on and if he's in the restaurant checks up on guests and talks with them, how nice!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, went there with a friend and my fiancé. No one came to take our order for 20 minutes. On top of it all once we got the food it was awful. We ordered nachos that the chicken was so dry it was insane and there was very little cheese. The rest of the entries were just not up to par either. I had enchiladas and they were not tasty at all. I have to believe either A. Many of these reviews are fake or paid, B. This is a place for people who just like to drink or C. it was an off night. However, I have had many of my friends from AZ tell me to stay away from this place so I doubt that it's C. I should have listened to the warnings. Hope you listen to this review and just simply don't go. Maybe they will get the message."}
{"text":"I came here once before and they had really good late night food so I thought I would try it again for dinner. But to be honest, it wasn't anything to be jazzed about and a little overpriced for how boring the food was. My dad had the rotisserie chicken which came with green chilli mac and cheese, but it didn't even have actual green chillies in it. I had blue corn enchiladas which were good, just not great."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your family.  It is reasonably priced, good southwest food and has a really nice atmosphere.  The parking lot of was crowded and we were unable to get a spot but there is plenty of parking"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place. The atmosphere is really cool. It's a big boat with a river going around it. Fun! The food was delicious and made with care. You can tell it's not some junk it's real food. New Mexican food is tasty. We ordered the green chili cheese crisp and I know some times those chilies are super spicy so I asked the waiter and he told me that this time of the year they are hot. I like spicy but the person I was with doesn't like it to hot. So the waiter offered to put that sauce on the side and that worked out perfectly. I had Santa Fe chicken wrap. It was really good. I highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials, nice outdoor area and everyone is always friendly. We moved here from NM and were excited to hear about this place, we gave it a few tries but won't be back. Everything we have tried has lacked flavor, especially any spice if it was the type of dish that is meant to be spicy. Overall, pricey for tasteless food."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here.  Only had iced tea.  Sat at the bar with a fellow comic and talked for hours.  Service was super friendly.
The end."}
{"text":"This is a great place that always serves up delicious food and drinks. When the weather is nice, I love to sit on the patio for the all-afternoon happy hour. The New Mexican pot stickers are very excellent and well worth trying. The rest of the food is well-prepared and flavorful, although  few dishes appear to be unique.

This place used to have a great selection of port, but no longer. The beers on tap are okay, but the margaritas are truly great."}
{"text":"This was my second attempt here. I wasn't overwhelmed. The food is a departure from typical Mexican so look at the menu. I ordered a grilled chicken breast and steamed veggies. Boring, I know.   It was flavorful though. We had chips that were actually really good. There a lot of heat to their salsas.  We sat on the patio. The atmosphere was great. They have a pond/water feature which was lovely. White twinkle lights and lit jalapeños  are strung above the patio which adds a little enchantment. The tables are low for the chairs, so it's a little awkward eating. You feel hunched over. While I did enjoy my dinner, I won't go back. Too many other great places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food has been great! I would say that the carne adobada is definitely my favorite.  The first time I went for breakfast and the food was great, parking was easy to find and our server was incredibly friendly, however, this was not the case the second time I went. The second time, I had to use the valet parking as their lot is pretty small, as mentioned by others.  The service was horrible and the waiter was incredibly rude.  Even though the food was great that time, the server had a way of ruining the experience for us and it makes me think twice about going back.  Upon leaving I had to wait 10 minutes for the valet guy to bring my car around as he was out of sight and no one seemed to know where he was."}
{"text":"SOPAPILLAS!!! so so good!!! 

Enchiladas were good.. chips were spicy and tasty!
Loved the patio dining ambiance! It's a little further away from Old Town but worth it!"}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is hit or miss for me. Their food is pretty good, and they have some unique options. Their New Mexican potstickers were good, except they were obviously microwaved. their filet tacos are good, except they have come out cold on occasion. Usually their black beans are delicious, however the last time we went they were ice cold, and had no seasoning, as if they had just come out of the can. The macacha beef chimi is really good, although it often has more onions than beef in it. The food here is spicy, so if you get indigestion easily I would pop a zantec before you eat! 

The service is also hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone friendly and attentive, other time's we'll get someone that basically acts like a dick. I hate having servers that are dicks. It kinda ruins the whole meal. I work in the service industry, no matter how terrible of a day I'm having or how rude of a client I have, I'm still NICE. Not nice servers makes me sad. 

Sorry, this review is going on and on and on. Basically, I like this place. I just wish they could step it up a little. Be a little more consistent, ya know?"}
{"text":"So great! I went here with my family and everyone was pleased with their meals. The outdoor patio was beautiful. There was a little waterfall and also an outdoor TV if you want to watch sports. The guacamole was phenomenal and so were the margaritas. It was an awesome experience."}
{"text":"We love this place, a standard choice for us a couple times a month for happy hour, late night eats or breakfast.  The brunch/breakfast fair is outstanding, if you enjoy a bit of heat and southwest fair in your food.  Unfortunately the breakfast starts late, so if you're early risers it is hard to wait 'til 10am for opening.  I regularly take my house guests or out of town friends here for the experience; they've done a great job on the design and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 10 celebrating a birthday with friends from out of town. The service was so so the food was so so and they never mentioned our birthday guest even though I specifically asked when I made the reservation.  This place is off my list. There are much better places"}
{"text":"I'm a local, and Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite restaurant in the area. CT has a great bar,  great food, and friendly service. Remember, this is New Mexican food, and not traditional Mexican food. I regularly send out-of- towners to CT, and I've received positive feedback each time. CT has great happy hour specials, too. (Recommended: Carne adovada, chicken quesadilla, and the blue corn enchiladas.) Tyler is the best bartender in the valley, so, hopefully, you'll catch him on a shift."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The first time I went I had the Chile Rellanos but with french fries instead of rice and beans.  I was really happy they accomadated my french fry substitution as it's a bit unusual. The Chile Rellanos where delicious, best I've ever had! I even had enough to take home.  The last time I was there I had the Macaroni and Cheese Bites and Chips and Salsa.  I love love love the green salsa, it's not a chili based salsa and I couldn't quite pin point what it was, but it's delicious!  The Macaroni and Cheese Bites are little bits of snacking perfection, I loved them!

I can't wait to go again and try more things!"}
{"text":"Great service in the bar for happy hour appetizer and a
Drink apiece. Thanks Natalie T!"}
{"text":"Dang, these other reviews make me wish I'd eaten more....  This was one of our \"bitch about work\" spots so we pretty much just stuck to drinks, chips & salsa and maybe a Quesadilla here and there.  

But still - I really like the place!  The set up in the bar is awesome, with kinda U shaped high back booths that allow you to squeeze in quite a crowd - and only the folks on the end really see anyone else in the place. Great for a girls night or if you just have obnoxious friends - and don't we all have at least a few?  The bar itself is really cool.  I love the look of it - very cave like.

What I really want to come back for though is their outdoor patio.  Huge area with tables and chairs all around and a great moat/fountain/waterfall out there.  While we all know this was totally man-made of course, it has a great \"hanging outdoors\" feeling.  Which of course you are outdoors... but.... well....crap.  It's like your \"outside\" vs. in a parking lot or a cement slab.  You know where I'm going here, right?

Anyhow, it's a good time, if your just hanging out with a frosty beverage or, apparently based on other reviews, to eat."}
{"text":"New favorite New Mexico style Mexican food joint. Granted I only have si senors and Los Dos to compare it to. Cool vibe from the moment you enter the parking lot. I think they wanna give you the nm cavern type vibe so me and my kickballer friends who came straight from the fields felt under dressed but have no fear the friendly staff shows love to everybody! We got there pushin 11 on a Tuesday night but still a very generous (variety and wallet friendly) list of choices to pick from. We had green chili Mac and cheese (only 1 other spot tops it) Carne asada fries, dumplings in a wicked cream sauce and cheese crisps with green chili. Definitely have the Carne adovada on something. We put it on the Mac and cheese you could do it on your cheese crisp or probably even the fries. Great late night drink specials. Ladies had a few different glasses of wine to choose from @ $5. Handful of draft beers... I'll definitely give a margaritas a chance next time. I was just in need of a thirst quenching beer. I wish I remembered our servers name... Slight ed Norton vibe cool guy helped us pick grub quick and friendly even though we were his only patio table by the time we left"}
{"text":"What a fun place!! 

A coworker treated me to their brunch a couple weeks ago and I was so impressed. Awesome Bloody Mary bar, yummy food and great service! Definitely a must-try place in Scottsdale, especially if you enjoy a little spice."}
{"text":"My husband & I went here for Valentine's Day Dinner. We arrived a little early than our reservation, so we hung out at the bar until our table was ready. When we got seated (outside) we sat for 19 minutes before a waitress came over to us to ask what we would like to drink. We ordered our drinks and asked if they could turn on the heating lamp next to me because I was cold. The short woman bussing the tables had a very difficult time getting it started, figuring out the propane needed to be changed. Then after multiple attempts to get it to work, they moved it and got 2 more which also didnt work. I was annoyed it took 3 heating lamps and 5 people to figure one out to get it's started. Guess I was that hassle guest! Lol anyways... The food was good when it was served although ridiculously hot, my husband burnt his taste buds off with his first bite of enchiladas. So he finally got to eat more after 15 minutes of cooling. It atmosphere was nice, but the service was definitely scatter brained on surprisingly not such a busy night for them..I am not sure we will returning, we definitely got the vibe that it's a local hang out kind of place, not an enjoyable evening..."}
{"text":"Great Improvement! Great Food, Great Service, Good Happy Hour!  I'm really glad I gave this place another few tries!

The Carlsbad Beef Brochettes were wonderful, except that I would request next time that they not be prepared well done. The portion was huge - enough for two - and I loved the dipping sauces. The prickly pear margarita was delicious! Even better, everything was on Happy Hour prices!

I've had less than great experiences here in the past, but whatever was causing the issues has clearly been handled. We also loved the Filet Quesadilla which we had on a visit a few days earlier."}
{"text":"We had 6 of us on a Saturday afternoon and it was beautiful outside so we sat on the patio. We had John (i think thats his name) as our server and he was great. Took wonderful care of us. Note* if you check-in on yelp, you get free chips and salsa*! For brunch we had....the lobster roll...so good! Lots of lobster meat and great flavor and served on a croissant. I had the Monte Cristo. Wow. I loved it! The Eggers cant be cheesers was just ok. Nothing special. The stuffed French toast was really good and the person who had it was happy with it. We did the bloody bar and mimosas which are super cheap and great. All in all, we really liked our selections, service was great and the bill didn't kill us. Cheers!"}
{"text":"It started out great. I loved the decor and came here due to a recommendation. Unfortunately it took a turn for the worst and we will never come back.  The server was awful.  My educated guess was that he had been drinking.  I smelled alcohol on his breath.  The restaurant was not busy and this server only had us and one other table.  We had small dishes piling up and we stacked them at the end of the table and had to ask him to take them away.  He seemed to be annoyed that we asked.  I saw server go outside and make out with his girlfriend in the parking lot.  Unprofessional."}
{"text":"this place is one of our favorites. the inside is fairly lame, but the patio is perfect. i always get the carne seca (or is it seca? i always get them confused) plate and i'm never disappointed. spicy enough it makes my nose run and loads of flavor. the service has always been on-it; i've never been left hanging with a burning mouth and no cold beer. i've never tried the \"american\" fare on the menu, their new mexican food is just too good."}
{"text":"I always have hope for this place because the location is perfect for me, and it seems like they have the right theme going for a decent restaurant, but I'm always let down every time I've tried it. The last time I went I sat in the bar area expecting to get faster service, but it was the exact opposite. They kept forgetting about our drinks, it took over 20 minutes to get our food, no refills, didn't ask if I wanted another beer, and then we couldn't even find our waiter when we were done to get our tab which ended up taking 15 minutes. The food wasn't great & it was kind of cold. If I hadn't of waited so long I would have sent it back. It was obvious that are disappearing waiter forgot about our food & it probably sat there getting cold.

The location is still great for me, so I'll probably try it again like an idiot. Who knows maybe I'll have a better experience next time, but for now I feel that 2 stars is being generous."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. I don't usually try much on the menu because they have the best Tortilla Soup i have ever had. I get the soup and house salad with jalapeno ranch - awesome. The patio is great when the weather is good."}
{"text":"Any place with an Habanero Burger served with a glass of cold milk is my sort of place.  Green Chile macaroni and cheese is quite tasty as well.  They also have a modest selection of craft beers on tap.  Menu is printed in/on a newspaper style format which is cute.  

Nice atmosphere with water and little bridges.  Good vibe."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon Happy Hour! The margaritas and mules were very well done. The prickly pear was so tasty and not \"touristy\" sweet. They use good tequila to make their margs. The blood orange was a bit sweet but still good. The Cabo margs were our faves. We tried the Cherry mule and the Jalisco, which had a good spice flavor. The hatch chile sauce was not very spicy today but still had good flavor. The Carlsbad Brochettes were cooked perfectly and the cheese crisp was good. I am a spicehead, so I wanted a bit more heat but everyone else loved it. We didn't try the regular menu items today, but I will update when we return. The real reason I am taking the time to write this review is for the service we received. Lottie was FANTASTIC.  As you know from reading my reviews, I fully believe good service makes the food and drinks taste better. It's becoming a rare experience. Lottie had great suggestions, knew when a drink was low or empty, and had a fun and energetic personality. I will ask for her when we return for sure. Good experience! The bat cave looks fun...but if I see a bat, I'm done."}
{"text":"22 years coming to AZ..first big disappointment for Mexican..ordered 2 margaritas..sent back..all lime juice..\"bad mix\"..ordered  2 beers & Maine Lobster enchiladas..4 small pieces of lobster for $18.50..talked to manager..\"lobster is weighed..you got 2 ounces\"..charged for 2 beers..did not eat..we left!"}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars on a few conditions.  But first;
1. We had a party of 12 that agreed to meet there at 11:30 PM because their web page listed a reverse happy hour menu from 10Pm to 2AM.  So one of our party arrives at 11PM and is told by the bartender they discontinued the late night happy hour.  When asked how long ago, he was told \" 3 years ago\"!  They would not honor the old prices so we went elsewhere.  In all fairness they shut down their web page to remove the reverse happy hour after we complained to the manager. 
2. A week later I went in for their daytime happy hour that is 2PM-6PM.  Had the potstickers. Nothing great, but different.  Had the shrimp tacos were okay.  Had a margarita not served in a proper glass, and salt I said I didn't want.  At least they use quality tequila, not that cheap Jose Cuervo crap.  I will be going back  again but..........
3.  If you are going to eat here go during 2-6PM, or their \"late night menu\" where  most of the prices are about 20-30% cheaper. Otherwise I think the prices are too much.  But if you are hungry after midnite when everyone else closes the kitchen, this might be a good pick for you."}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican food if that's what you're looking for. The interior and exterior of the place is very fun though and that's part of the reason for giving a higher score than just 2 stars. 

I ordered the guacamole, chips and salsa for a starter. The guac was for sure nothing to get excited about. They played it pretty safe. Nothing unique about it at all. Very simple. I guess you could also say it was very americanized.

Also ordered a Pina Colada. It was okay. A tiny bit too sweet but not bad.

For my entree I ordered the Vegetarian Enchiladas with mushrooms, asparagus, some special spicy creamy sauce, rice and beans. The flavor was a little weird. The type of weird that would make you question if you might be spending the rest of your day getting cozy in the bathroom. Very weird mix of flavors going on with that plate. 

Lastly, I ordered the Prickly Pear Flan. Which was actually the main reason I chose to eat at this place. When it arrived at the table, the presentation of it made me feel it might have been a few days old. Was all crumbling apart which is something I've personally never experienced with flan. Check my picture out of it. The look of it looked disgusting but the taste was yum. Although, I didn't taste the flavor of the prickly pear as much as I had hoped. 

Eh. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  Fun decor, great atmosphere, excellent service and really awesome food.  The lobster enchiladas were over the top!  I can also highly recommend the deep fried ice cream.

Kristin's service was great!  Anticipating our needs and reacting to our group of 10.  The patio was a great place to enjoy after a baseball game!"}
{"text":"Carlsbad Tavern is a very nice find that is right next to where I live.  That will be great when I can drink it up and just walk home without having to worry about a DUI!  

I came here with my dad, so my entrees were strictly vegetarian.  I could smell the seafood and could tell the specialties here are more seafood oriented.  I will have to update this once I try something like a crab enchilada, but the smell was wonderful.  The flavors in my vegetarian burro and my dad's blue corn cheese enchiladas were amazing.  It wasn't so hot spicy, but there were a lot of amazing flavors.  If you get an item, I do highly recommend them to put easy on the cheese because I felt like half my plate had melted cheese.  I got a skinny margarita to go along with it.  

The one downside is that they don't offer complimentary chips and salsa.  We actually ordered some, and it came after our food.  I was a little bit disappointed by the cost of it and the late delivery, which is why I give it a 3-star.  This will probably change after another visit, but this is just my first impression."}
{"text":"Went back.

Ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer and sat on the patio. WONDERFUL. I was full off half this thing. It's def a meal in itself.

My boyfriend got the open faced green chili burger that came with fries. He was lovin it. It's not the most appetizing thing to LOOK at, but the taste is delicious. Great meat, perfectly cooked. Even though he ordered it well done, the sirloin ground beef held super moist. Next time I need to take some pictures. 

I can't give this place 5 stars yet, but it is my favorite local hole that I will be back to dozens of times."}
{"text":"Great Food in AZ. I recommend the pork plate (I forget what it's called). The crab cakes and skewers are also excellent. Good local beers on tap and they are very friendly to Spring training baseball goers! Great service and open late! After 10pm they have a late night menu, which still has a great selection that will fill you up! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. The inside is pretty dark feeling. At night it can be somewhat difficult to navigate your way through or even read your menu. The best part is outside! Outside on the patio they have a pretty \"stream/mote\" whatever you want to call it, with the misters a great combo. The menus are on newspaper that looks like its out of a western which is cute.

My favorite dish is the chicken fried steak, it's delicious! As far as an appetizer the skewers are good with mean and veggies. My favorite, and most unhealthy, green chili mac and cheese. Yum! 

I have been 3 times and each time service has been slow. That and the inside being dark are my only complaints. 

Other than that this is a great place for happy hour or to grab some dinner with friends/family. One out of the three was a date and I wasn't impressed for a first date."}
{"text":"The service sucks. One waiter w glasses either hates life or his job, he should figure it out because he sucks and and makes the experience bad. The food is decent not bad but because of the waiter w glasses the experience was bad. I will say though, the owner does pay attention and I feel strives to do his best to make sure the customers leave happy. Third time is a charm!"}
{"text":"We ate here a week ago on a last minute choice and it turned out to be pretty good.  Two of us had the fresh snapper tacos and really enjoyed them.  Very big portion and the fish was very good.  One of our group and a combination enchiladas, chicken and crab.  Also a very good portion and good food.  Our other friend had a crab stuffed chili pepper and it was huge.  He ate half of it.  Also very good.  Service was good and all in all it was a nice meal."}
{"text":"Love this place -- good, consistent quality food, great menu, friendly service -- but oh my stars and garters, the prices are certainly high.  $13 is too much for a burrito with just rice and beans on the side!  Also, they used to have an amazing prickly pear flan but they changed it and now it's too sweet and doesn't have the right texture for a flan. The chicken-fried chicken meal is still a good deal, though."}
{"text":"This has been a fave of ours and a place we bring out of town friends for years. My husband always has the carne adovada plate, which we first learned of from a Phoenix Magazine best dishes of the valley issue. THe patio is so great for all but the midst of summer. Great margs and happy hour they are a deal and some great food deals, too. The filet tacos are my favorite. Last time hubby had the amazing meatloaf...wow! Tony was our waiter tonight and once before...he's great...super helpful, friendly and a sense of humor. Two of us had the pasta special tonight and while it was not as flavorful as we had hoped, we still love this place.  Our friends insist we come here when they visit and we are happy to oblige!"}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome outdoor setting with waterfall and little moat. Prices were reasonable and server was very attentive. Great for kids as well. Would absolutely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Carlsbad Tavern since they opened.  I am SOOO SAD to say the quality has gone down hill the past six months!  The Carne Adovada Plate was always so tasty but the last several times I ordered it was dry and tough or else loaded with fat and quit greasy.  The Chicken Quesada used to be the BEST in town but no there isn't in cheese inside the Quesada.  I don't know if there's new management or that they just don't care about quality any longer.  It's sad to lose one your go to places but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not seein' it, guys. My husband and I were eager to try Carlsbad Tavern after reading the Yelp reviews. The service WAS good, and very attentive. The complimentary chips and salsa were good; the salsa did have some kick to it. Our meals, however, were very lame. I had the blue corn enchiladas - one chicken, one shrimp - and honest to goodness, the \"meat\" had no discernible flavor. Not only could I not tell which was which, but couldn't identify a particular meat flavor at all; the ingredient was totally without flavor. My husband ordered the chile rellenos which he reported also lacked any discernible flavor; he said the only thing that had any flavor was the cheese. For dessert we had the sopapillas. No flavor there either! Granted, the meal was only $37 for two entrees, three sopapillas and two house margaritas (good flavor, verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry little alcohol). We were not inspired enough to go back. Bummer. Not a place for foodies."}
{"text":"My son wanted to go here for his Birthday. It is a little drive from where we live. The decor inside was supposed to have a cave look with bats. (Not Real Ones) HeHe. I had heard that everything was really spicy. This I did not find the be true. I got the Carne Adovada plate. The meal was good but not spicy at all. I may not be the one to judge of what is spicy as I am a hatch chili fan. The hotter the better. This is one place you don't get free chips and salsa. We ordered the chips and salsa. Their salsa was good but again not very spicy. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The service was good. The meals were reasonably priced maybe a little higher than I am used to paying for the same type of meal where you get free chips and salsa. I did not like paying for the chips and salsa. I would definitely eat there again if I was in the area but not good enough to travel 30 miles just to eat. 
Eat Good Food"}
{"text":"I went to the Carlsbad Tavern on Thursday for Happy Hour.  Their Happy Hour menu is pretty solid.  

I loved the Habanero Sliders.  They were quite spicy, but realllly tasty!  I also tried the Chicken Quesadillas.  These were pretty bland.  

The $5 happy hour margaritas were STRONG.  I almost \"fell asleep\" in the car on the way to the next restaurant, which we all know really means passed out.  I can't help it!  I am a lightweight.  One drink and I am two sheets to the wind!

The waitress was pretty on top of things, seeing my Yelp app open and bringing me free chips and salsa without me having to say anything.  Score!

I loved the outdoor patio, but I did get bitten by a mosquito while sitting there.  Water features are really soothing, except when they're inhabited/infested!  

I will definitely be back again.  Next time, I am eating dinner here!"}
{"text":"My family is from New Mexico.  I grew up on posole, green chilies, carne adovada, sopapillas...  This is the best New Mexico style mexican food I have had in the Valley.  Totally chill environment.  A true hidden gem. I always have to drive by like 3 times because the sign is black and it is tucked behind some vegetation.  Cheap.  Big portions.  My favorite is the carne adovada with red sauce.  It's definitely campy with fake rock walls with stuffed animal bats hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, newspaper menus and a lagoon outside, but that is part of the charm for me.  You don't have to be a fancy person to feel at home here and go ahead, bring the kids.  It's family friendly."}
{"text":"The patio atmosphere is one of a kind and the service was top notch. First time here and not the last."}
{"text":"Michael Martin Murphy might have said \"it's a long way back to New Mexico\", but in Phoenix, you can take a short ride down Hayden from Old Town Scottsdale to Carlsbad Tavern for a great taste of New Mexico.

this place is really cool.  As you might be able to gather, the restaurant is \"named after\" the Carlsbad Caverns.  (Did you know that a Cave is technically not the same thing as a Cavern but that a Cavern is a cave?)  The ambiance/decor of the restaurant is a cavern theme.  When you approach the building from the outside, it looks like you're approaching a \"cavern\".  When you walk inside, the restaurant looks like a cavern!  There is a moat with water outside that runs through the patio area. 

I've been to CT for large lunches and smaller casual dinners.  I love the patio outside for this!  Oh, on the cooler spring evenings, that patio is addicting and intoxicating.

Now, for the food.  I have ordered several things from that menu.  I enjoy the Green Chile Stew.  It was the first thing I ordered when I went there, and I'm one of those weirdo creatures of habit, I\"ve probably ordered that 75% of the times I've been there.  I've ordered the Caverns Chicken Salad and I think it was Lobster Enchilladas more than once.  Their Sopas are very addictive.  You've been warned. 

what I like about their food is that every darn thing is so cheesy!  They put a lot of cheese their food.  If you're looking for HOT/Heat, they can certainly spice up your life.  Their menu warns you about the spice level of certain food items.  I would say heed it, but you won't listen to me, now will you.  I tried that Habanero Burger and got half the pepper on the side... it was not that bad at all.  hehe...

Give them a a try, you will like it."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Mexico, so I'm not sure I would classify it as \"New Mexican\". However, if I was craving New Mexican food and lived in Phoenix, I'd probably go here because it'd probably be the closest thing I could find. :) 

Lot of baja California influence. (Scallops are unheard of on a New Mexican menu). 

Good local brews on tap."}
