{"text":"Le serveur etait tres disrespectueux. Je me suis lever  pour aller dire au serveur que j'étais prêt à payer. Je m'était tromper de serveur mais il m'a crier après en me disant \"est ce que je suis ton serveur??\" Trois fois avec un attitude et un regard comme si j'étais un moins que rien. Jamais je retournerai à ce restaurant, si vous y allez vous aller être déçu du service attention!!!"}
{"text":"The very best Italian poutine in Montreal !  I kid you not, I have a picture of it hanging on my kitchen wall it is such a thing of beauty.  The regular poutines, the pizzas and the subs are also delish. They make all their sauces from scratch.  The portions are huge and the price is cheap.  Love to watch the crowd that hangs at this place.  Service is always fast and friendly. It's a pretty big place so there is almost never any wait to be seated. Except during the fireworks shows in June.  Nothing fancy, just good honest eats."}
{"text":"Really good \"cheap restaurant\". Poutine, burgers... I recommend their chinese macaroni. Good breakfasts too... The waiters are really nice and friendly, the owners (greek) are joyful and everybody seems to love their job ! Nice place for a quick and non complicated meal !"}
{"text":"This is a real good place to go eat. I love the food over there. The price are a real bargain and their portions are huge! The place isn't too fancy, but they know the food is more important. Last I was there, the waitress was a real pain, she was slow and messed up my friend order, beside taking 30 minutes to bring us the bill... usually they're faster, so hopefully it was the exception."}
{"text":"The best comfort food I've had since like forever. The Smoked Meat Poutine was the  star, and the portion was gigantesque. The hot-dogs had mouth-watering slaws and pickled onions, and the chicken sandwich was really amazing as well.  The service was really fast, and food came out really quick. The menu selection was huge, and everything seemed so tasty (okay maybe not the \"Chinese Macaroni\", that looked terrible).  The place was very crowded and very loud, but the atmosphere is great! You feel like a Québécois the moment you enter the restaurant. And when you hear the waitress asks if you want your hot-dog \"steamé\" instead of \"à la vapeur,\" you know you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"Pain doré !   J'ai adoré mon brunch du dimanche au Lafayette. Le serveur était super gentil et serviable, mon pain doré était fluffy et léger. On a rempli mon café au moins 4 fois, ce qui m'a plu. Pas trop cher non plus, et beaucoup de choix.  oui !!!"}
{"text":"Pour de la bonne \"mauvaise\" bouffe, c'est parfait! Bonne quantitée pour le prix, service toujours sympa. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Typical greasy spoon. Good prices, insanely huge menu with endless choices, portions big enough for two, and fast service.   Me and my boyfriend got a side plate of onion rings, a small poutine, and four hot dogs. It was honestly too much food. Half of the portion of the poutine would have been enough to fill me up. Even my boyfriend thought it was too much food, and he prides himself on his bottomless stomach.    The only downside was the hot dog with cheese and bacon I ordered. It was so pitiful! A square piece of bland Kraft cheese and a sad lone piece of bacon. But the rest of the food was really good so I didn't really matter to me."}
{"text":"This is the temple of cheap lunch! They have good casual food at very cheap price."}
{"text":"best diner around and its open early and stays open late. The breakfast there was phenomenal! Just like being back in the US.....well except that the waiter who spoke french and broken english was from mexico and not Montreal. It is amazing how many people we thought were local that came from somewhere else. Our waiter was one of them. the place was owned by greeks who know how to run diners (most diners in jersey are owned by greeks) The portions were generous and the ingredients fresh. the place was clean and bright and had 'tude. Love it. I am just sorry we didn't notice the place when we first arrived cause I would have just eaten there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!"}
{"text":"Diner- great omelette & poutine fries. Came with cole slaw and mixed veggies.  Nice meal.  Crowd was interesting."}
{"text":"Consider this your typical diner with nothing fancy about it. i am a fan of places like this for the simple yet delicious food. Especially nice when you need to cure that hangover. The coffee and food are great for the price. Probably the best inexpensive diner in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing really has stood out. I had breakfast yesterday here and lunch today. The pizza was a little above average. The French toast was mediocre.  Service was OK. But nothing about this place warrants anything above three stars."}
{"text":"Gotta love me some old fashioned diner food late at night when it's freezing cold and Paté Chinois is on the daily special. My dining companion devoured the fried calamari and gives it a 7 out of 10 which, all things considered, is high praise. A special note, one of the 2 people sitting next to us asked for very burnt toast. The banter with the waitress was really sweet and they had a good laugh and...he got his very burnt toast! He was tickled pink. The place is so welcoming at 10PM on a cold evening and it's great to get service with a smile and a meal that's filling, tasty and really affordable."}
{"text":"Cet endroit est juste à côté de chez moi. Quand j'y vais, les patrons et le personnel me saluent par mon prénom et me tutoient gentiment.   Je connais l'endroit depuis très longtemps et la formule n'a guère changée. Tout au plus, l'endroit a maintenant un permis d'alcool et quelques machines de loterie vidéo. Puisqu'on ne peut plus fumer, il faut bien remplacer un vice par un autre.   Cet endroit est l'archétype d'un restaurant jadis italien racheté par des immigrants grecs: la pizza y est à l'honneur mais on retrouve aussi des brochettes sur pain pita. Chaque semaine la liste des spéciaux (repas 3 services) est mise à jour.   Les portions sont hyper-généreuses, par étonnant que le matin on y retrouve des journaliers et des cols bleus venus manger de gargantuesques \"petits\" déjeuners."}
{"text":"I thought this place was \"Restaurant Lafayette\"- don't recall anything about a hotdog.  Oh well.  $7 for OJ, Coffee, 2 eggs, 2 french toasts, 4 bacon, 2 toast, roasted potatoes, and a fruit salad? Um. Yes please.  Great food, cheap prices, doesn't look like a secret, but well worth a detour to Papineau Metro for a cheap and filling meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Montreal for the first time. Traffic was a nightmare, the public transportation system wasn't differently-abled-people friendly, and we hadn't brushed up on our French beforehand so communication was sometimes an issue.  But Lafayette, which happened to be in walking distance of our B&B, was a Godsend. Normally when we travel we don't visit the same restaurant twice because we want to experience different things. This time we agreed we were getting dinner there on our second night too.  The food was great. I just got poultine, but as far as comfort food goes Quebec has America beat. First night was plain old regular poultine, second night was the Lafayette poultine which was topped with hamburger and onions.   My wife got the chicken macaroni one night (this may have been the Chinese macaroni other reviewers are talking about - the menu was French and I made my orders without knowing 100% what I was getting.) I didn't think at first it looked that appetizing, but after my wife wasn't able to finish it and I took care of the rest (in the interest of not wasting food) I conceded that it would be perfectly delicious for whenever I'd need a brief break from poultine.  The service was attentive. When one of the waitresses had very limited English she didn't act put out by our lack of French. The price was very reasonable.  I've had good tasting poultine dishes in British Columbia but Lafayette's seemed more authentic. Now if only we could take public transportation from Olympia, WA to Montreal, QC so I could try the Italian poultine."}
{"text":"This is a \"go to\"  for me and my man! The poutine is cheap, big and one of the best we have tried in town. Their pizza is actually really delicious too! The service is fantastic here, always. It's has a very American diner feel to it.   Good variety, good service, good prices and tasty food!"}
{"text":"This is your typical neighborhood dinner, the food is descent and pretty cheap. There is not much of an ambiance really. The seating arrangement is pretty awkward, the chairs and table are fixed to the ground and they are a bit far from each other so you need to be leaning all the time. The coffee cup was leaking all over the table and if a napkin fall on the ground they just putting back on the table. So I guess you get the idea, not fancy but practical if you want a quick bite and you are right there then it is worth it."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant and the service was cordial. The portion sizes were very generous and the food was delicious. I highly recommend the chicken and butterfly shrimp."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner of this restaurant. Love the friendly service. The food is what you would expect in this kind of restaurant. Hamburgers, pitas, pizzas, submarines and of course their breakfast! Huge portions for the price. I really like the food there. I pretty much tried it all but my favourite is the chicken pita platter. I always order the double pita so i can have some for later! Lol! My husbands favourite are their pizzas. The breakfast and brunch is also quite good! I recommend this place to all!"}
