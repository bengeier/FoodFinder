{"text":"Basic hotel restaurant. I had the Hambougeouis vegetarien (veggie burger) with rondelle d'onion (onion rings) and chocolate milk. Appearances were pretty good, but don't expect big portions. I would say just right for a meal with no left overs. Onion rings wrre also served in a metal basket, as though it were just fried, so that was a nice touch. unfortunately, I came in right after a big group of 8 and was seated right past them from the server's station. So despite the restaurant being practically deserted (total less than 18 including bar patrons)  it took almost 8 min before I could place my order (eating solo). when my order was delivered, it was messed up with someone's from the big table, and, no ketchup. Server also didnt return to check on meal and was a pain to track down for a check. Decent food save the rating, but barely.   don't eat in a hotel restaurant unless you have to. thankfully the food is acceptable if nothing else."}
{"text":"Bacon cheeseburger was disgusting! The burger patty was frozen + cheese wasn't melted. It's crap for $12! Never again!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been at the restaurant just because it's conveniently located in the Holiday Inn. Tonight I ordered the black bean tortilla with tofu, grilled veggies, and curry mayonnaise. Instead of their side of fries I ask for a side salad which they charge an extra $1.25 for which I thought was ridiculous. Anyways, perhaps it was the chef or something but I really don't care for my wrap. I actually enjoyed my small little side salad more then I enjoyed my $15 veggie wrap.  I've had other items from here before. The veggie pizza here is pretty good-nice portion for one person--you don't leave too full either. I wouldn't pay $15.00 again for it though. I also had their vegetarian burger which was pretty decent as well. The pricing here sucks. If your gonna charge $15 for pizza, a wrap, and that burger at least deliver the product for what it's worth. Oh and their happy hour isn't happy hour prices either.  I only come here because of convenience. If your staying at the holiday inn and your looking for food that's a little cheaper-try going across the street maybe."}
