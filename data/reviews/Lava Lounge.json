{"text":"Excellent experience! We stopped by during happy hour and ordered a bunch of excellent small plates to share. Everything was delicious. My favorite was the goat cheese and zucchini pizza. The happy hour prices were great ($4-$6) per small plate and we loved sitting on the back patio. 

Will definitely be coming back to Lava Lounge soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for an impulsive dinner out.  The BEST calamari in town!  The pulled pork sandwich with blue cheese slaw is fantastic with a cool draught of Magic Hat No. 9.  I have always had friendly, attentive service. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is one of those bars that makes me want to spend more time in Tremont. It is cozy yet modern, with an inventive menu and delicious drinks. 

I look forward to trying more items on the menu, but I have to say that the hummus with tomato jam was a rather odd dish. The flavor combination was off, although I expected it to be good. If you get the hummus, don't mix in the jam like I did!

The Perfect Pear martini is delicious - great flavors and not too sweet.

I enjoyed the music, both the background music earlier in the evening and the DJ later on. I'm curious if people dance here - it is perfect for it!

I may be a bit picky since I am always cold, but I would ask that they not run the ceiling fans on high during the winter - it made the place a bit chilly when the place wasn't that crowded.

I am excited about returning!"}
{"text":"I like the late night menu, and I like that you always run into a few people you know here. This place draws a diverse crowd."}
{"text":"The Lava Lounge always finds a way to hire surly bartenders.  And I mean surly in the best possible sense.  They hate frat boys and girls who dress up to go to a bar, people who order things like Raspberry Stoli or something that involves a blender.  

I spent basically my whole senior year of college at this bar, and learned to love the surliness of all the staff, the cheap drinks, the regulars there with me at the bar, and especially the little computer game machine in the corner where I would waste all the quarters I should have saved for laundry."}
{"text":"Well, let's start with the complaints since only three things stood out to me. 
1. The food is a bit pricey for what you get (except fries) 
2. The Decor seems gridlocked from a 90's MTV Jams color scheme set as if Picasso threw up on the walls 
3. pretentious hipster towny vibe... 

Other than that the food is good you just don't get enough of it. The beer list is decent and the prices are on par for most bars. The Bartender was pretty F'n cool he was spot on with our orders and drinks. Overall nothing stands out about this bar but if you live in tremont you should probably dink here. lol..."}
{"text":"The Lava Lounge used to be cool, now it sucks hard.

Went last Friday at about 11pm.  I knew we were in for trouble when I asked for one of their tap beers and he said that we couldn't get anything on tap because his lines were being cleaned.  No apologies, just in a snarky asshole tone.  Maybe you should have planned ahead.

So we get the special of the night, pre-mixed long islands.  We sit down and want to listen to some music and are ready to feed the juke box, but no options on the screen.  I ask the bartender about it.  \"We turn it off on the weekends\", he says in a condescending, not giving a shit, way.

So we deal with Ke$ha and the litany of pap crap that ensues until we finish our drinks.  This place used to be a haven from the frat boy/sorority girl infestation downtown.  Actually, the bar's concept and Tiki-theme is credited to Rob Zombie's bassist.  Sorry to say that Zombie's bassist would be appalled now, vomit, and then leave and never come back."}
{"text":"The happy hour is incredible! 

I love that it lasts later than most happy hours and the Calamari is fantastic. Seriously...amazing. 

The drinks are strong and worth the prices."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting Lava Lounge on 11/10/13 for the first time....for a Sunday it was laid back and quiet just what I wanted for a quick night cap before the work starts....the barmaid Shelly was awesome and my drink \"Ruby Red\" she made to perfection.....definitely will be back....so give em a try I think you'll like them!"}
{"text":"By far, my favorite bar in all of Cleveland. The happy hour can't be beat, the bartenders are personable and know their stuff. The bomb pop is freakin' awesome and before you know it, you could drink 3 they go down so smooth. I like the fact that it's a smaller place, very chill/darker loungy atmosphere with music always playing. I've walked out spending more money than I had planned but that's always because I wanted to try everything because it was always good (I've also walked out sh!t face drunk because they make killer drinks but that's another story..)."}
{"text":"Tremont is a restaurant oasis and Lava Lounge is the hidden gem in this neighborhood.  The food is insanely good.  They have a regular menu with an always rotating specials section that provides a good selection of edibles.  The food is interesting and unique, but always tasty  to the palate.  My girlfriend and I, being locals, frequent Lava once a week and are excited to try the new items on the specials list.  There are a large number of drafts available along with a bottled beer list that is quite large for any beer aficionado.  The wine list is just as well thought out as the beer selection. 

Although there are other restaurants more well known in Tremont, Lava Lounge is the neighborhood's best kept secret."}
{"text":"The vibe is the best part of Lava Lounge: good design and well-chosen music in both the upstairs bar and the larger downstairs. Lava used to be too smoky for me, in the bad old days, but as a post-smoking-ban bar, it is a happy place for me.

The drinks are the next-best part: I've never had a bad cocktail at Lava Lounge.

Service, though, runs hot and cold. I have had much better experiences sitting at the bar than getting table service, but that could be just the luck of the draw.

Added bonus: parking in the lot across the street in the evenings is now legit. Hoorah!"}
{"text":"man, people HATE hipsters. i am amazed how many bar reviews always contain commentary about the clientele. as i've said before - are you there with people you like? is the music good? is there still alcohol available for sale? COOL. your night should RULE.

what's ironic about this is that we ended up at lava on a night that we went to prosperity and it was too weird for us (not with hipsters, but with olds) and so here we were. if i can hear snoop, michael jackson and jay-z on a saturday night at a bar when i am hanging with one of my friends making fun of other people and drinking beers then i think its a success.

i didn't see any hipsters here on saturday, but i had a great time regardless and until the dj started playing extended remixes of sister sledge i was down. no food, just booze, but i've heard the food is nothing to complain about. 

i am sure i will be back, i have been haunting tremont like a ghost."}
{"text":"Went here on a late night to meet up with a friend for drinks and I must say I enjoyed myself. The atmosphere was relaxing and the drinks were perfect. It was very easy to talk and the service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"and now, a song to commemorate my dining experience at the lava lounge.

yum yum yum yum
food in my tum tum
tasty hummus
complete with a wine list

..um..and this is where my lyric writing falls to shit.

poor lyricist skills aside, the lava lounge shouldn't be overlooked for food.  of course they have a great selection of good beers on tap, plenty of wines, and a martini list including a whatchamacallit martini (!!!)  but man, the food is TAST-EEE.

the hummus is soooo good.  warm fat pita bread.  and the rest of the menu doesn't skimp either.  really great stuff.  veggie wraps, unique burgers, cheese plates, i mean, good eats.

my first experience at the lava lounge years ago wasn't so hot, but i'm glad i went back.  they get kudos in my book.

Edit 1/5/08:  another venture to lava produced more good experiences.  friendly staff, great people at the place, and a good dj.  as a stop on my birthday scavenger hunt, the following experiences occurred:
a) i was proposed to by a stranger
b) three hot boys signed a birthday card made for me, one of which told me he's always loved me and we are supposed to do it.
c) a haiku was written for two strangers sitting on the couch, together, but text messaging others in silence.  there was much laughter when presented, being that the last line was \"talk to each other\"
d) the dj did not mind posing for pictures with the bday girl

and throughout all this insanity the staff and patrons of this fine establishment were not only pleasant, but extremely fun and kind.
lava lounge will be much more predominant on my tremont outing list.   one more star for them."}
{"text":"+1 for the dark, angsty, red lighting
+1 for the beers that were on tap (I got Pyramid something-or-other)
-1 for the bartender mistaking my order for Pyramid beer for bourbon, neat (?!?) so I guess that's a -1 for noise as well
+1 for their food, fried and ready as a preventative measure for your next-day hangover
+1 for lack of crowds during certain off-times (where we still had a great time)
-1 for the clingy server who guilted us into ordering food as we were just lounging on a couch upstairs at 1 am, not really wanting to eat
+1 for the people-watching opportunities
+1 for feeling great about yourself for not being a hipster like most of these guys and gals.

A fun place!"}
{"text":"Dive bar of my dreams! Awesome music, great lighting, down to earth people. Everything just fits."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour on a Monday and the place was really dead. But, I was with a group of girlfriends so we were content with it being just us in the bar. We all ordered a bunch of food, calamari, wings, sweet potato fries and everything was really good. All the food was devoured accordingly. The martini's we had were mixed just right and chilled to perfection. The patio is great for those of us who chain smoke while we drink. All in all, I think this is a great choice for happy hour."}
{"text":"Holy veggie tacos! So delicious!

I also chose to enjoy a happy hour drink here recently. It was ok, though it tasted more like a glass of Skyy vodka than a citrus flavored cocktail. Oh well. I powered through it and didn't have to drive home!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: worthless.

No. Just, no. I lived in Madison for 4 years and never came to this place nor ever heard of a single person who had. Now I know why.

Location: hidden off the main drag. Bouncer: really, for this place? Bartender: nice. Drinks: not as cheap as other places and much weaker. Patrons: townies and/or creepy as all get-out.

The decor was the only saving grace of this dive. They really went all out on trying to decorate the inside with tiki-themed posters and idols and the like. But it just couldn't overcome the other issues.

Oh, and did I mention that the entire place reeked. Like, seriously smelled like a toilet. 

We couldn't believe how bad it was. We literally made a promise never to return."}
{"text":"This place definitely screams after-hours bar.  I went with a friend to have post work dinner and drinks.  The chicken satay was overcooked and dry, and the accompanying peanut sauce was runny.  The chicken had a good flavor but still... Bar service is good.  Very dark in there."}
{"text":"One of our favorite happy hours! Excellent food & great cocktails.  Wonderful weird movies on the tv, too."}
{"text":"Lava Lounge is a fun place to grab drinks and chill. Located in the Tremont area, usually fun and poppin on the weekends. Definitely a stop when you're in the neighborhood.

They have a pretty awesome happy hour, plenty of seats, good drink selection, always friendly service, and a DJ on the weekends."}
{"text":"Lava is a local Tremont bar. It has two floors and an outdoor patio. It is located by Lincoln Park. The atmosphere is full of character just like Tremont! Everything from local artists' work to the classic leg lamp in the window of the second floor. If you are from Cleveland you know all about the leg lamp. The bartenders are tentative and personal. My favorite dish is the calamari!! One word AMAZING! The dishes are unique and prices are moderate. Check it out and feel like a Tremont local!"}
{"text":"We always end up at the lava lounge.  It's a nice little bar, cool decor, comfy couches, great DJs.  But be careful about opening a tab...four of us had $120. tab in an hour, a little ridiculous!"}
{"text":"So I'll be honest and say I completely forgot this place even existed. My knowledge of it from years ago was that it was more of a trendy weekend spot for hipsters in Tremont. Found myself here around 5pm on a Wednesday in search of a good happy hour. While I wanted a good happy hour, what I got in fact was a GREAT happy hour. 

Before I get into the happy hour though let me describe the decor and set-up a bit first before I get into the good stuff. The bar is u-shaped, seats about 10-15 and is separated in half by a weird pillar. There are about 10 tables or so surrounding the bar and a small stand (for what looks like a DJ). There's one tv and not many frills in the design of the bar/restaurant.

The star of the show here is the food and prices. Happy hour is from 4-8 and features both food and drink specials. $2 beers (rolling rock included), $6 cocktails and food from $4-6. I got a cocktail and it was absolutely one of the most refreshing drinks I've ever tasted. My girlfriend and I got a pizza ($6) chili fries ($4) and a spicy fried chicken sandwich ($6). The pizza wasn't all that special but was highlighted by very good cauliflower. The fries and sandwich though were absolutely amazing. The quality was top notch and presentation was done very well. Our total bill was $21 and we left full and happy! Highly recommend the happy hour."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab something small before heading downtown to meet friends. The music was great, although too loud to have a conversation with the person next to you, most customers are treated like regulars. The crowd is kind of trendy - read hipster- which should be no surprise in Tremont. Prices are reasonable lots of options under $10 and drafts are fairly priced with a good seasonal rotation.

There was some sort of cyclist meet up going on the night I came here got crab cakes and a ruby red martini made a few friends and will definitely return when I just want to pop in for a drink and a bar bite."}
{"text":"So the food is really tasty. But the bartender seems to be upset to have guests every time I go in. I end up just doing carry out."}
{"text":"Awesome place for just dinner and/or drinks! Best chicken sandwich ever! Had a great party in the upstairs. I was totally pleased as I am every time I come here! Service is great!"}
{"text":"The most chill laid back spots in CLE. Always a nice mixed crowd. Food is amazing! Good dj's,some nights old school hip hop & r&b,& funk music. Bartenders always friendly. Outdoor patio in back & another bar/lounge area upstairs. I love this place. Good drinks,good food,good music,good people! This is my \"Cheers\"."}
{"text":"Salmon tacos were so good I wanted to take my panties off and throw them to the chef with my number lol ... Instead I gave him a big hug.
I've never had a taco that I didn't have to put sour cream or salt or some kind of sauce on to make it taste good... This Salmon Taco needs none of that. by far the best taco I ever had!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's so overly hipster that It makes me laugh,  so I relax and enjoy it.  

The food is pretty tasty,  the martinis and delicious, the beer selection is good, and the bartenders are incredibly friendly!  One night I wanted a hot buttered rum. . . The bartender didn't know how to make it, which usually doesn't bode well, but I wanted one and was willing to let them take a shot provided that they had everything.  So I pulled it up on my blackberry, showed it to her and she disappeared into the kitchen only to re-emerge with a pretty decent hot buttered rum!

Fuck yeah!"}
{"text":"I like it here, it's a once every two months stop for me.  The upstairs is great for parties and my favorite part of the restaurant.  I only drink when I come, never had the food.  I kinda find myself wishing they'd maintain the building more... 1st floor bar area is a little beat, but it's a cool place nonetheless and I usually don't remember leaving because they have a nice little IPA selection."}
{"text":"My first experience in Tremont; I need to get out more. The Lava Lounge is not hidden, but it's not exactly tucked away either. Approaches very much like a small hole in the wall restaurant you might run into in San Francisco, and the food is on the same level (excellent.) I was called into work a few minutes before hand and I had just tossed a t-shirt and jeans on, and I was lucky to find there was an eclectic mix of people inside so no worries on the dress code. There is a small bar area with tables seating about 20 or so on the main floor. Apparently, there is an upstairs with pool tables and a more relaxed vibe, I'll have to look for this next time. First thing aside from the layout that hit me was the smiles coming from the kitchen. Those guys were clearly loving their job and/or the kitchen company; either way, happy kitchen staff typically makes for good food.

I grabbed one of the specials, skirt steak tacos (as did my companion) and we grabbed sweet potato fries. Allow me to say...I have had sweet potato fries at The Penguin in North Carolina (regarded as some of the best in the country) and these were easily able to hold their own. The fries are served in a thicker cut somewhere between \"steak fries\" and \"traditional cut\" fries, but they were crispy and the portion size was enough for two to split. The skirt steak tacos were classicly paired with chimichurri, and both were executed flawlessly. I did get one tough piece of steak, but that did not ruin anything for me. I'm not much of a drinker, but my companion had a beer (not my thing) with some apple notes that was decently paired with what we were having.

All in all, the food was great, the service was great, and I got out for two people under 30 bucks including tip. The ONLY gripe I have is that when we sat afterwards to have a conversation the music got a little loud and I was using a raised voice to have a conversation. However, I knew going into it that there was a DJ, and so I chalk  that up to something expected."}
{"text":"Very good food at extremely reasonable prices.  Spicy shrimp and hanger steak are standouts, and if you are a french fry connoisseur, you owe it to yourself to at least try them here...quite unique, and for my money, the best around.  Seems to be a semi-secret neighborhood place, less crowded than it should be; if it were located on the main strip in Tremont, it would probably be hopping most of the time.  Lava lamps for a funky, casual downstairs; disturbing Pompeii-inspired paintings (minus half a star) and comfortable couches upstairs.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Banana split, Espresso, Creamsicle. 

Yeah, those are names of the martini's I tried at Lava Lounge - and that's not even close to a complete list. Tack on other candy-like concoctions like the refreshing  Blueberry Basil Lemonade and you've got yourself hooked!  And just at 9-10 bucks to drink your dessert!

Oh yeah - and the food is making me hungry just thinking about it! A very stand American menu except everything is just a little bit special - in a good way. Take the Cobb salad. - it's got a poached egg right smack dab in the middle of it! And avocados, roasted red peppers, bacon and chicken - but ask for the red wine dressing - perfect-o!

I'm so glad we ended up their for a girls night! The only thing that was holding me back was the volume level since the girts had to talk, but even that was tasteful. And the music was just my style too: pop electronica. I even discovered a new band. It must have just been that my super loud Lava Lounge experience was right after Micheal Jackson passed away and they had to pay some cranked up tributes."}
{"text":"Love the Lava...

THE UP-SIDE:
This place is hip and cool and full of great music, good food and fun people.  It's got great atmosphere (try the upstairs when open) and a friendly staff.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
At times, this place can suffer from an abundance of those awful Tremont-hipster-posers.  Can be loud; not great for a first date.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
You've gotta try this place.  It's everything a hip, neighborhood bar should be!"}
{"text":"We had a surprise b-day party in their upstairs room on a Saturday night.  We had around 30 guests. The decor was great- there was a mini-fire place that had candles in it that was a nice touch.  Comfy couches, chairs some high tops and a few little tabels.   There  was plenty of seating and we had our own bar and bartender.  We had plenty of appetizers that were delicious (sliders, wings, spring rolls).  I would highly recommend this cool room for any type of get together (b-day, bachelorette).  
They have a patio that looks like it would be fun in the summer."}
{"text":"Lava lounge is such a gem in the Tremont neighborhood. It's laid back, has good food and beers on tap, and is a perfect spot for a chill evening. 

I love all of the vegetarian options that they have in the menu, my favorites being the fried cauliflower and the portobello mushroom taco! (I don't even like portobellos but that thing is delicious!)

The service is kind of hit or miss. Some of the bartenders are so apathetic and others are spunky and fun!"}
{"text":"Props to Lava Lounge for offering up the upstairs to a group of drunk Yelpers on Saturday night. 

I think I may have almost passed out on the comfy couch. And definitely had a hard time making it up / down the stairs. If you helped me, thank you!"}
{"text":"Went in for the 100th time last nite and for the first time ever waited OVER an hour for my food while EVERYONE that came in after us got their food and drinks. Waitress never noticed nor cared and bartender made excuses for the kitchen instead of apologizing and making it right. Basically they forgot about us even though we were RIGHT in front of the kitchen. I have loved Lava Lounge for years and won't go back for several more. My advice is skip it and go to Bar Centro on 25th ST, Good Food and drinks till 2 AM."}
{"text":"I don't go here often and with good reason -- there doesn't seem to be anything this bar offers that another place doesn't do better. If I wanted to dance or act crazy - there is Brothers. If I want to sit outside - I'd goto Vintage or Johnny O's. If I wanted a quieter place to sit down and talk - there is Red Shed, Segredo's(cause its usually dead) or Blue Velvet. The drinks are OK, the bartenders are OK and its ok to stop on a bar crawl but not somewhere I stay for long."}
{"text":"Don't sit by the door in the winter! other than that it's pretty good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here with my sister for Happy Hour and there are specials for martinis, beer, and appetizers. We tried their asian wings, hummus w/pita bread, and calamari. The wings had lots of zing to it but the hummus was just ok. I wasn't wowed on it. The calamari was alrite as well but again nothing to crazy to rave about. The drinks on the other hand were strong but definitely worth it for the price $5.50. I had the pineapple bomber and my sis got their tequila something. Both were fairly made well. 

This is a nice place to just chill with some friends, located right across from Grumpy's. The staff is friendly and they even got free WIFI, which is always a plus. They say they have DJs on the weekends so I'm gonna have to come back for that some day."}
{"text":"Welcome to my Friday nights.

My friends and I enjoy the Tremont scene on Friday's. Wind down from the work week or studying with a drink or 2 or more...and in our case this mostly turns into an all night dance party upstairs... But anyways. On to what you should not miss.

The food. My virgin experience I had tried the Fried Calamari, Wings and Arugula Salad. This was one of my first attempts at calamari and I loved it!. 

2nd time around...out with my girls for a bite to eat and martinis before heading dt later. I love hot dogs. I know. But this one with the peanut sauce and other special treats on top was divine. Best ever. Usually on the \"specials\" sheet.

3rd...and beyond...Pulled Pork=delicious! But my GO TO's are the Cheeseburger=I die. And the Veg Tacos=Love!

Now on to drinks. Check out the Perfect Pear. Yum! But do explore the Tini list. The specialty beer choices are also awesome! David (my fav!) is usually working upstairs on a Friday night has a beer cracked open for me as my foot touches the top step. 

You can't go wrong with Lava...to start with or to finish your night off right or before heading home for more fun. And if your lucky-for date night.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had just moved into Cleveland for work when we decided to tour local watering holes to find a place we might frequent during our stay. The Lava Lounge was our biggest disappointment. The best part though was not having to spend a dime to find out how off this place was. My friend and I sat at a table and no one came to serve us. After 5 minutes we moved to the bar and after another 5 minutes the girl behind the bar came over and asked if the empties in front of were ours. We politely responded no but before we could order she grabbed the glasses and disappeared. Another 10 minutes sitting at the bar with 3 people working with only a light crowd AND NO SERVICE! Anyway, we left without spending a dime glad to save our money for better bars.

Otherwise, Lava Lounge is what you would think it is. A smaller lounge type bar with hip music, hip kids, and not so cheap drinks. It doesn't seem like a bad place for people watching or relaxing but the interior is a bit mundane. I'll probably give it a second chance at some point but I felt it only deserved one star if for no other reason than as a warning to people who actually care about where they drink."}
{"text":"Nice, chill, intimate atmosphere. Very friendly staff, food and drinks are tasty."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday nite, they had happy hour until 8, wow.. Great happy hour choices, we had the chicken Satay served with this amazing peanut sauce and this coleslaw.  The coleslaw was amazing, it was apples, carrots, and onions, it sounds weird but its a must try.  I even went home to try to duplicate it... The bartender (Macklin) was very friendly.  He gave us such great recommendations.  We ended up on his recommendation of the chicken taco's, nothing else to say but they were amazing.  We even recommended it to the people sitting next to us.  If you love lava lounge like we did, you will have to also try another best kept secret, their sister restaurant, \"Fat Cats\" !!!"}
{"text":"This update has been a long time coming, but I am happy to finally get a moment to reiterate my praise for Lava Lounge.

This is one of the best late night food places in all of Cleveland. And the cocktails (which I've been drinking more of due to the great cocktails emerging in The Cleve) are pretty top-notch. They had a peach/lavender sangria last summer that was incredible. I am hoping and praying they bring it back for another tour in 2013.

And guess what else? NO TV's! Having no TV's pretty much ensures a night of minimal Woo and a very small sampling of Bros out hogging or getting wasted or whatever they are doing nowadays. 

The mac & cheese is great, the white bean soup is very good, and most everything else I've had there is well above average. 

To top it all off, there are very nice people that work there. And you can rent out the upstairs for parties."}
{"text":"I love Lava!

The Lava Lounge is always my go-to place. Great food, drinks, music and people.

I love their food (although I feel it has slipped slightly over the years).  I miss the oysters on the half and the stuffed mozzarella they used to offer. I'm also not big on the shoestring fries. They used to be huge and battered. 

Definitely not typical \"bar food\". The owners also have Fat Cats. It seems like the offerings at Lava are almost Fat Cats quality, but for a much lower price.

Most of the time, there's a DJ. Once in a while, they will have a live band playing salsa or something. Always good music. Always a fun time."}
{"text":"soooo delicious!
ok so it was random night out with my friend, and we both couldn't go out til after 7, but i was hoping to get to a happy hour still. i looked up all the happy hours i could find in cleveland and came across lava lounge! seemed like a random spot but i took a chance on it bc the yelp reviews were so good.
walking up to the place, i was starting to feel a little more iffy. i didn't want to get my friend's hopes up about the food bc we're both foodies so i just told her that the menu looked like bar food. it looked like a typical bar, very dimly lit, mostly empty at the tables but there were a handful of people at the bar.
there were 3 menus that we got - one regular menu, one happy hour menu, and one specials menu. the menu was pretty different from the one online, but the one online does give you a general idea that they have a big selection of random various items.
we were there before 8, so we ordered from the happy hour menu. i think they're kind of lenient with the time of happy hour, because around later 8:15 the waitress came up and asked if we wanted anything else to drink before happy hour was over.
i got a tequil-ya. wow strong dinner cocktail, and yummy! my friend got a guinness. we are both vegetarian and love trying everything, so we split the goat cheese spread and sweet potato fries from the happy hour menu, and the crispy tofu sandwich from the specials menu.
everything came out pretty quick. i was a little worried about how the food at this little bar would be, but i shouldn't have. everything was delicious!! sweet potato fries were just crispy and thick enough. goat cheese is always yummy and the tomato jam it came with was good too. the crispy tofu sandwich was the best though, i hope it stays on their menu. there was mango cole slaw and some kind of bbq sauce on it. the tofu was cooked or fried just perfectly to be a little crunchy on the outside. there was a cold cous cous salad thing on the side which was good. it was so delicious, i'm salivating just thinking about it.
overall, i'm very impressed with the drink and food. price was good too. can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" hang out in Tremont as I live 10 minutes away.   I always enjoy the bar staff, great menu and great cocktails.   My only wish is they'd throw a few more decent stouts on the beer list.    It's bar food on steroids.... Hangar steak with chimichuri and frites are amazing and you can beat it for $11 or so.  This is the kind of place you come to after being out of town for a week and need to get a bite to eat at 10pm and a drink."}
{"text":"The service here is slow most times, but the food is really great.  Try the falafel tacos.  Plenty of delicious beer.  The patio is cool but I tend to get eaten alive by bugs there for some reason."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that a friend took me here for happy hour. 

It's such a chill environment. And it's not showy. Come to think of it, I don't think this place is on a lot of people's radar. It's been around for at least 6 years now. Perhaps the fact that the newness has worn off is actually why I like it so much. 

They have a great happy hour selection. It's extremely well priced. The snacks/appetizers/tapas plates are well portioned and taste great. I recommend the fried cauliflower or hummus and pita. 

I've only been here twice, but both times, it wasn't an issue at all to find a seat at the bar, which is fully stocked. The wine selection is decent and they mix the cocktails strong. 

I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"The Lava Lounge is a fun destination -- hipster lounge meets corner dive. Our party of four arrived during happy hour and enjoyed some yummy, offbeat $5.00 martinis, like pineapple  bomb and rocket pop.

We also ordered apps and burgers; they were all delish -- this place would rate four stars except for the piece of paper embedded in our apple cobbler dessert."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in the city!

My Lava love runs deep for several reasons, but happy hour is number one.  It goes until 8pm, which is awesome for a happy hour since most end by 7pm at the latest.  That extra hour is a treat.  And the food is fantastic!  

Full disclosure time: I would kill a man for their sweet potato fries.  

Luckily they're only $3 during happy hour, so I don't have to, but they're THAT good.  They're almost like jo-jo's with a tempura batter.  Delicious.  The rest of the happy hour menu tops out between 5-7$ for some pretty tasty food, and they have a decent range of $5 cocktails, which means you can get a full dinner AND a fancy cocktail for around $13.  You can't beat that.  If you don't catch happy hour, the regular menu isn't bad price-wise either.  I'd recommend the chorizo mac & cheese, which is incredible.  

For a long time I avoided this place because I remembered when it opened and was THE place to go.  Even all these years later, in my mind, that meant it was douchey and full of people trying too hard.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  It's definitely \"cool\" inside (we are in Tremont), but It's totally relaxed and full of regulars just looking to hang out.  No one's trying to impress anyone here.  And the staff is super friendly!  

With the awesome happy hour, delicious food, friendly staff, and relaxed environment, you absolutely cannot go wrong here!  If you want to make an evening out of Tremont, this is the place to start."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  On the weekends I work at another restaurant in the area.  This place is close enough to walk to after I'm done.  I have a feeling going that is going to be a tradition.  The bar tenders were great, the drinks good (albeit a little pricey).  The pommes frites were good.  Sweet potatoes dipped in tempure batter and served with garlic aoli.  They were great."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from eating their cheeseburger- BAD. I passed out on my floor at home upon returning from there, and I had all of the *glorious* other symptoms of food poisoning. I have never got it that bad. No one else in my group got it, and no one else had the burger, so DON'T ORDER THE BURGER!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Girl and I were in this very beautiful commercial enclave to look at some property, and it started to pour.. heavy Midwestern rain. 

We ducked into Lava for a much needed beer! 

Introduced to Oberon summer ale, and a very very fine burger. 

The menu was very eclectic and rather ambitious for such a small place. 

The staff: incredible service, I mean the best in a very very long time. 

The crowd: Angsty hipsters quiet and polite....nothing we could not deal with..lol..no problems 

Decor was all candle and dark and dramatic...I kinda liked it ( not my type ...but hey!) 

Great experience but pricey"}
{"text":"Cool little trendy bar / restaurant in the Tremont area of Cleveland.  The have a real nice selection of designer beers (Some I'd never heard of before) and the food was pretty good.  We were there during the expansive \"Happy Hour\" which I think lasted until 7:30p.  

Big standouts were the Hummus and the Tacos.  I'd definitely come back here for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"Cocktail selection is not too great. Ordered a side or sweet potato fries. They are heavily breaded with pepper and the red sauce given did not go at all. My sister ordered a beer and got a 4oz and paid $8. Way overpriced and why is it served in a cocktail glass? I wanted ranch dressing for my fries and couldn't even get that. Very disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem... but I sort of hope it stays relatively hidden! It's a small little bar in Tremont, easily walkable from the main area of Tremont but slightly off the beaten path. They have a surprisingly robust menu with lots of quirky options; our first time, I ordered the cauliflower banh mi, which was easily one of the tastiest & most creative sandwiches I've ever had, & their fries taste more like tempura potatoes than regular fries (which is just as amazing as it sounds). The servers/bartenders aren't necessarily the friendliest, so it can feel a little but like you've stepped into a neighborhood joint full of \"regulars\" where newbies aren't welcome, but overall, it's got an enjoyable enough ambiance, good enough food, & inexpensive enough prices to be totally worth a little bit of discomfort."}
{"text":"I've been to the Lava Lounge a few times in the past and have always had a good time, so I decided to start my birthday bar crawl off here last weekend.  They have great happy hour specials until 8 pm - even on a Friday!  And my most favorite drink - the Moscow Mule - is even featured on their happy hour menu!  Score!

I tried to prevent epic drunkenness later in the evening by trying out some of the vegetarian options on the happy hour and regular menus.  That didn't work out so well for me, but my food was pretty tasty.  The $5 hummus from the happy hour menu was definitely fresh and garlicky and the pita it was served with was warm.  Considering that it was a happy hour special, I expected the portion size to be small, but it was actually a good size.  I also tried a vegetarian bean soup on their specials menu that was just ok but the vegetable tacos I had were amazing.  I dare say some of the best vegetarian tacos I've ever had in Cleveland!

The only bad part about my evening at Lava Lounge was how crowded it was.  I rolled in with a fairly large party and we weren't able to sit together to eat, and most of us had to stand around the bar.  But we worked it out.  For the specials, it was worth it.  I'd definitely go back to the Lava Lounge for happy hour once my liver recovers."}
{"text":"per the grapevine this place has the best burger in Cleveland....hmmm I gave it a whirl, Service was great, and more so was the other guest we chit chatted with.  I love Clevelander's and there colorful personalities.  Come on yes I am biased I came from this bloodline Midwesterner's Rock.

The burger was ok fries pretty good, But being that I spent 2 years traveling abroad trying a shit load of meat pattys I think this one was an average bear.  (yes I can say I am a burger connoisseur my curves prove it) 

Beer was cold and so was the weather \"Welcome to Cleveland\""}
{"text":"Lava Lounge is a swank, secluded hole-in-the-wall with impeccable service, a perfect veggie wrap (all about that basmati) and enough crimson midnight mood lighting to make Nicholas Winding Refn blush. There are three areas to explore: the bar proper, the patio, and an upstairs bar available for private parties. Of the three, the upstairs is the most unique. Recline on mucho comfortable couches. Order from Lava's host of extravagant cocktails with a personal barkeep. Peer down on the street past the drowsy cool of the signage. The only downside is the bartender will have to make frequent trips downstairs for ingredients, depending on what you order. Be that as it may, it is a small concession to be made for the luxury of a cozy room away from the rabble. If you can't get the upstairs reserved, either downstairs area is more than adequate. No matter where you sit, the bartenders are always energetic and witty. The food takes a while, but is divine. The lighting may bother some (it cannot be reiterated enough how red it is in this hip magma cave) but I find it sexy in the way night drives in the neon city under summer rain are sexy. See for yourself: you'll likely fall under its spell."}
{"text":"If I'm in the neighborhood drinking, this will be a stop. Good food, good prices. There's a memorable pear martini that is a must..."}
{"text":"It may not be the best food in Tremont, but it's likely served with the least baggage here. This is kind of an un-Tremont place. The vibe is laid back, and though you may see a hipster or three, there is no sense that they dominate the place. The patio is great -- it feels like the back yard of a good friend. The food's pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great drink selection, good music, cheap prices = great experience.  Their pulled pork sandwich is to die for.  I must return... immediately."}
{"text":"Lava Lounge is a great low key bar in Tremont. I was expecting a little bit more before I went for a night out. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were great! They were playing a rockin' playlist too, which was very enjoyable. The food was great too. 

It is nice to be able to out in Tremont and not spend a ton of money. They were very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I appreciate surly bartenders as much as the next person, but I'm sincere when I say, fuck the fucking Lava Lounge.  What I once thought was an amazing respite from the campus crap that is located near University Ave, I have just realized is full of lame ass poseurs and bull shit bouncers. Case in point: my dear friend was assaulted today (by a bouncer) for insisting that he drink his drink he just paid for at 1:30 am, before legal bar time but after Lava Bar Time.  Despite the fact that the regulars and employees, were allowed to finish and order more beverages, we were violently and rudely ushered outside.   The bouncer, grabbed my dear friend by his arms, ripped his shirt,  forced him to drop his drink and then threw him outside.  The people outside assaulted him further until someone sober enough finally listened to us and realized that we were not drunks, just people who enjoy beer and unfortunately thought we should enjoy it at this odious establishment.
Fuck this place. Do not come here unless you enjoy being harassed, because you're not a pierced tattooed regular."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I consider this our bar.  I graduated and moved away from Madison in May 2005.  I have been back a few times and every time I go the bouncer recognizes me at Lava Lounge.  This is either because it is a great place or because we are the only people to go their that aren't covered with tatoos.  
The drinks are really cheap.  The bartenders are friendly too, unless there are more than 10 people there.  It is by far the best decorated bar in town."}
{"text":"Lava Lounge has a great happy hour, M-F from 4 to 8. Perfect time for dinner. I love the sweet potato fries and burger. The crowd here is always very diverse and I love that -- it's multi-racial and good combination of youngins, yuppies, and old guys."}
{"text":"I will admit my first experience was not the greatest.  Upon arrival, shortly after opening I assume, the bartender was not happy to have to remove himself from his seat to wait on strangers.  The music got louder, and the ambiance was lost, like my hearing.  I left shortly after for a quieter, more friendly location.

On my next visit I was greeted and promptly served.  Every time since the food has been spectacular.  I have tried many menu items along with specials, and I am very impressed.  The crowd is mixed with regulars, randoms, and in betweens, which I enjoy.  I enjoy the intimacy of the hidden back patio, it is closed off and comfortable.  

I truly enjoy a few of the bartender's personalities now, where as I did not my first time.  I am glad I gave it a second chance."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I have been here several times with just one other as well as medium size groups.  The happy hour menu is extensive.  The waitstaff and the food are wonderful.  The apple slaw is especially good.  The draft beer selection is somewhat limited though."}
{"text":"Omg loved the place. Masthead Coffee stout perhaps the best stout I've ever had. Another happy Happy happy hour for my hubby and I. We ordered pasta fagioli and a burger from the happy hour menu and roasted Brussels sprouts from specials menu. Food was awesome. Cool intimate place. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always been here on an 'off-night' (Sun-Tue) and stayed for a beer  or two while waiting for food.  This has only been a handful of times, however it has never been a favorite place of mine to go.  The staff never seem very friendly or welcoming like most places in Tremont.  Kind of like you're interrupting something better that's going on in there.  

Food-wise, It's not hard to please a happy, semi-drunk girl, so that's never been the problem (yet, has never been amazing, either). 

Usually a last resort, change-of-scenery, don't wanna talk to anyone else sort of place to go.  Oh, and within walking distance.  So, there's that."}
{"text":"I just have to update this to 5 stars because anywhere that I can get drunk during Happy Hour for less than $16 deserves 5 stars in my book.

Oh yeah. Yelping while enjoying said Happy Hour is probably not appropriate but I really need to share this news!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is good. The chicken tacos are outstanding. The burger is tasty. Everything here is at a great price for the quality and I find myself coming here more and more when in the mood for a great meal that won't make me broke for the night. The beers are a little too high of a price. I recommend either sneaking in alcohol, or drinking water."}
{"text":"What a gem ! The service is quite extraordinary.Lorraine is by far the best bartender in Cleveland ! She has made my husband and I feel like we were dining in a 5 star restaurant. Have only sat at the bar , linen knapkins and killer cocktails . The menu is wonderful many choices curry noodle bowl and mac n cheese are phenominal. Will definitely be back . Not to be missed . Small intimate atmosphere"}
{"text":"I wish I took a pic of my food, but it was so good I ate it before I could even remember to snap a pic! I got 4 items in the menu. 2 orders of wings, one buffalo and one Thai. The Thai ones were reaLly distinctive, I can almost taste them now. Very crispy in the outside and meaty, and the peanut sauce was memorable. The buffalo wings tho!!!! We're heaven!!! My husband only let me get 2 before he made them all disappear! Spicy and the blue cheese was everything!! Enough about the wings....the tacos! I got 2 tacos. One was a falafel taco, the other was veggie I think it had mushrooms and cilantro and other stuff, not too memorable. The falafel taco, however, was best of both worlds for me. Mediterranean meats taco?!?! Heaven again ! All in one night! The atmosphere was very chill. We went on a Friday night. It was dark, music was loud n people were minimal. Bar was popping, we sat at a dine in table. Low key. I would love to try more menu options!"}
{"text":"Back for my Pulled Pork sandwich listening to NWAs F*** the Police. Love the dark atmosphere here and PAXn up. 
This place has earned its right to this short review. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I love the downstairs of Lava.  It's always chill with great food.

I also love the upstairs.  It's the perfect place for a birthday sort of party.  It's private, with it's own bar, plenty of seating and tables plus its just kinda cool.  (-:  I especially like the strange fireplace and all the Sign Guy art hanging up on the wall.  If nothing else, it's a great conversation starter!

The bartender staff is always friendly and if you do buy plates to share, they're delicious!  The minimal cost to rent out the upstairs is more than worth it."}
{"text":"I love Lava lounge.  Dare I say it?  I think this may be my favorite bar anywhere.And now since the last review I've made friends with most of the bartenders. Everyone is so friendly and the atmosphere, drinks, and 
food... Wonderful!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in the area. Runs till 8pm, and has a great app/small plates menu.  The Havarti Cheeseburger is really delicious. Sweet/savory combo makes it.  Had the tapenade last night. It was good, but there was still a whole olive in there!  Not the end of world, just and oversight on chef's part.  If you've ever been a chef, take note of their kitchen.  Teeeny tiny!  But they make it work."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by one of my coolest vegetarian friends and I can see why. Lots of items on the menu are meat-free - I tried the hummus plate ($4 during happy hour). It was tasty! A little heavy on the garlic but good. My burger was just okay - I don't like horseradish sauce so I wish I knew it was going to be on there to have them hold it. Crispy chicken sandwich was tasty not too greasy. Fries are tempura style which I've never had before. Overall, I would definitely go back to have a beer especially with a vegetarian friend but I will definitely pass on the burger and try something else."}
