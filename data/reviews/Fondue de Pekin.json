{"text":"It's a new hot pot place in the 2nd chinatown of Montreal (Brossard). They offer many variety of different soup base, from spicy to all kinds of Asian mushrooms flavour to tomato flavour. It's an all you can eat style (sort of) some item they charge after ordering it the first time.  Food quality is stunning, maybe it's a new location so all their food are very fresh, really surprising. However... Their soup base is somewhat tasteless... I ordered the tomato soup base and guess what... All the food that I dip in turns out pink... Not sure what kind of colouring tomato they were using lol  Service wise... Umm lots of work needs to be done. I ordered a couple stuff that I have to repeat and repeat, the waitress has some attitude, we asked for some spoon and somehow she forgot to let us know they have no more... I had to ask another waiter after waited 15 minutes to know they have no more... Otherwise I would of waited the whole night.  And the order sheet, no matter what's the number you put on, they'd still just give you 1 portion, I even wonder what was the point of ordering.  Many things needs to be improve... I'll wait a bit before going back again..."}
