{"text":"I was staying in town for a week. I wanted to try new places while i was here. I read reviews for Jet. Couldn't wait to bite into it. When i did i was very bummed out. Nothing like the reviews at all. Altho delivery was fast and food was hot."}
{"text":"Yumm. Just got back from there, thought we should give it a try.  We had the deep dish pizza.  Very tasty.  Everything tasted fresh.  They put lots of tomato sauce on it, I like that, usually pizza places are stingy with the tomato sauce.  It's not overly greasy either.  This is definitely above the average pizza place.  I would certainly recommend this."}
{"text":"Got a pizza it was poorly under-cooked and I tried to get it fixed and the managers were not at all helpful to the situation I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I drive 30 miles round trip to pick up this amazing deep dish pizza! Can't leave out the top notch cheesy bacon breadsticks! Second to none - can't wait for the new Mooresville location in January! Whatever the toppings, best pizza around!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving 1 star because zero is not a choice. I called this evening to order a pizza for delivery at 10:36 and despite the hours posted online as being until 11 was told that they would not take my order. Not only was the associate who answered rude, he hung up on me. 

When I called back to ask for his name to include in a complaint to corporate, he said he would not give my name, told me I was being childish and asked me how old I was. This is how you speak to someone that's ordered from your business over 20 times in 2014 including for a large birthday party. 

Clearly no on cares at the location, won't take orders even during posted business times and are rude and will hang up on you. Way to go Jetts!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience...save your time, money and taste buds. Ordered online beef, mushroom and black olives. I received what I ordered but with pepperoni.  I called to let the manager know,  the employee that answered the phone said \"dont eat it we will need the pizza back and it will be at least 45 minutes before we can get you a pizza out to you\" I asked for the manager and he shifted the the mix up as a corporate issue because what we ordered included pepperoni even though it never mentioned pepperoni on line when ordering \"BOLD FOLD\". Needless to say the manager was an inept moron. I work in the customer service industry and obviously this guy doesn't know the first thing about servicing and maintaining his customers.  The correct solution would have been...please allow me to remake your pizza and get it out to you as soon as possible and please accept a credit for a future pizza.  That is how you maintain and grow your customers... IDIOT MANAGER. needless to say i demanded my money back and they came and picked up the pizza. NO EXCUSES IDIOT MANAGER. I will be sending this to corporate hopefully they can use this as a training tool or to relieve some inept managers from their duties."}
{"text":"As another review said, this place really deserves more of a 3.5 than a 3, but that's the only option. 
On a late night, I decided to take the deal on the ad: 10.99 for 1 large 1 topping pizza and 1 small deep dish pizza for free. I went with pepperoni
It was a fantastic deal really. In 20 minutes, I went out to pick up the pizza and brought it home to try for the first time. 

The pizza actually tastes pretty fine, but my one gripe is how greasy it is. I guess that's how they achieve the crunchy crust and it does have great texture, but the greasiness can get overwhelming after a few bites. Actually, the oil is itself a flavor of the pizza it seems. The way I figured around it was to put a piece of paper towel on the bottom and let the paper towel soak it up. 
You have an opportunity to be friendly to the environment by reusing by squeezing out  said oil from the paper towels and pan frying other items in your refrigerator. I suggest eggs. 

For my small pizza, I got anchovies on them. Now I've never tried that before, so here's where I don't know whether it's a matter of custom or Jet's, but I got about one anchovy each slice. I don't know if that's how it's suppose to be, or Jet's might have been a little skimpy on it. All I can say is that I felt like I was just eating cheese pizza and at one point, it turns into an anchovy pizza and vanishes soon after. 

Despite these things, finished the entire pizza over the course of a few days. Would I go back? I suppose if I have that particular craving for the crust. This is definitely not a place to avoid. It's worth a try. :)"}
{"text":"most dank thing i have ever eaten!! if i were on death row my last meal would be jets pizza #soof. deep dish out of this world i swear if you dont like it you dont know pizza."}
{"text":"In the world of delivery pizza places Jet's is king.  The first time I experienced it was at a party and it was the BBQ chicken persuasion.  I was \"that guy\" at the buffet hoarding pizza.  Since then I've tried numerous varieties and not a single piece has been left uneaten.  I could seriously hurt myself devouring one of these tasty creations.  You MUST get the 8 corner pizza.  The round one just isn't the same.  This rectangular pie offers crispy edges on every slice.  Maybe that's not your thing, but it sure is mine.  You can customize your crust with Cajun spices, garlic, or butter.  They also have an item called a Jet's boat which is basically a gargantuan fold-over.  Of course, there are salads and wings, cinnamon sticks, and cheesy bread.  I've only picked up from the Strongsville location.  I heard the consistency at the Westlake one tends to vary extremely."}
{"text":"Jet's is still pretty new to Champaign and I usually wait a month or two for the restaurant to get the kinks out. I'm glad that I didn't wait though!

We ordered on a Saturday night. They said the it'd take about 30 minutes. I thought that was pretty reasonable on a Saturday. They showed up on time, too! Friendly delivery guy!

When I called in my order, the young girl on the phone seemed a bit confused, but I know that everyone is new and still learning. Despite a bit of confusion she was polite and my pizza still showed up on time, hot, and the order was correct. 

We got a hand-tossed pizza and had a coupon for a free, small deep dish. I LOVED the hand-tossed crust. I don't know what it was about it, but it was delicious, flavorful, a bit chewy and crunchy! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. The deep dish was good, too. It's not like a Chicago deep dish, it's not as thick but still good! I preferred the hand-tossed crust but my husband liked the deep dish. 

The sauce was really awesome. It had a real fresh tomato flavor. The spices were spot on. They were real generous with the toppings. Plenty of sausage, onions and pepperoni.

I was really happy with our pizza and we will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Deep dish at its best. Service is great and consistent. I never have to wait long for my food whether deliver or take out and it always fresh! Joe, I believe the manager, is super friendly and accommodating. Will always be my fav!"}
{"text":"Wow. They \"fixed\" deep dish. It's like pizza hut pan style, but without the stomach pains after. Plus they have options to get every slice a corner slice, and let me just tell you you want a corner slice, you need a corner slice, and you got to get yourself a corner slice ASAP. 

 You know how everybody's favorite part of the pizza is always the crust? Well your Liars cuz no one likes crust on pizza out of all the other choices, but I kid you not you will fight for every last morsel of a crust from this place. I also had one of the jet italian-style sandwiches and it was killer, they use the same dough for the bread and it is awesome.

Sauce wasn't sweet like I despise, and all the ingredients were fresh and delicious. I ordered online and the system was standard and fine to use, and also the two people I spoke to one in person and one over the phone were very friendly and helpful.

If you're the type of person who doesn't really like deep dish because of all the bread, your problems are over! Just order it already and then say I'm glad I read that and got me a corner slice of goodness."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza--  our go to almost every time and always when we have guests. The manager is also great and once comped me cinnamon sticks for being a loyal customer. I've never tried any of the other menu items-- 8 corners is the way to go every time. Worth the price and the calories!"}
{"text":"Do not order their chicken wings! they were so TINNNNNY (they are the size of my thumb! i don't think iv ever seen chicken wings that small before!!!) and ridiculous expensive!!! trust me, stay away from their chicken wings!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time last night for dinner and I have to say the meaty pizza was very good and not too greasy and the garlic bread was tasty and yummy. Me and my husband will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"So, my girl and I just moved in near Jets so naturally we had to try it while all our stuff was still in boxes. I called in the order while we were across the street having a beer at Fox's and we went and picked it up. wow...  I haven't had delivery/pickup pizza this good in a long time. Do yourself a favor and order square cut. Good stuff."}
{"text":"We just moved to this area, and the thin crust pizza here is the best pizza we've found so far in the area. We relocated to Monroe and I still drive to Matthews sometimes to get their pizza since they don't deliver to us since we are so far now. I'm not as much of a fan of the regular pizzas but the thin crust is superb."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but the staff leaves something to be desired. My last order was delivered by an older gentleman who grunted when I tried to speak to him. My crust was also incorrect, regular when I specified thin."}
{"text":"Ok so my wife is from Michigan and I lived there for approximately 8 years and consider it my second home state. We currently live in Morgantown, WV so finding a Jet's Pizza within an hour of us was both a stroke of luck and the one of the best things ever. This out of Michigan Jet's tastes just like the real thing (as it should). It was just awesome and reminded us of home. My advice is to get an 8 corner or two and Jet's bread...one of the best pizza joints ever.."}
{"text":"Fellow Michigander and Jets enthusiast and they nailed everything down to the ranch dressing. Look no further than the deep dish style pizza. Not like a Chicago deep dish that's all dough, it's a light and crispy crust that literally has no other comparison. Haven't had a good slice of pizza in Arizona for 3 years until today. Thanks Jets! You taste just like home."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but service not so much. Called back because I didn't get all my sauces. Manager argued with us saying we told them not to bring our free sauces. No apology and left us on hold so she didn't have to deal with us. I'll be going to Pizza hut or Poppa Johns where I don't have to argue with management."}
{"text":"We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and the bread with jalapeño cheese sauce. Everything was delicious and totally satisfied my pizza craving. Super filling fyi, i normally eat about 3 pieces, and i could only eat one.  You can tell and bread and crust is homemade, it has a unique taste. Loved it, we will definitely be ordering again. Delivery was also prompt. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that is was a little overly greasy and the jalapeño cheese sauce wasnt hot."}
{"text":"Loved Jets back when I lived in Michigan. This Jets isn't nearly as good. Hand tossed pizzas were a mix between too doughy on top and card board on the bottom. Topping amounts were sufficient. Delivery directions given to the person on the phone we clearly not transferred to the driver who needed a lot of assistance to find the park location we requested delivery to located on the south side of Mountain View, between 32nd and 36th street."}
{"text":"Love Jet's! I am from Michigan and was soooo excited when I found out that this place was owning a few miles from our new house. Tastes just like the Jet's I know and love in Lansing, and the delivery time is always shorter than what they quote you. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Recently used Jets for a large order for a party. The order was completed perfectly and all the food was good. One of the employees even volunteered to help me carry everything to the car in the rain."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the Piedmont!  The service is great too."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza... Get the 8 corner pizza, every piece is a corner piece. Ask for the turbo crust. Delicious"}
{"text":"It's all about the Deep Dish.  The other pizzas are ok, but the DD rocks!   Remember how good Pizza Hut pan pizza was when it was first introduced?  This Jet's DD will take you back.  The 4-corner can feed 2 if you add one of their tasty salads.  Otherwise go for the 8-corner.  I don't recommend trying to eat it there.  Not much of a dining area."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Don't forget the Jets bread."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  I am not sure how they can get away with calling this pizza. I know I'm not in NY and compare everything to that, but really,  this was horrid. 

Ordered 1 sausage pizza. The sauce was so bitter I had to add balsamic glaze to get some flavor and cut the bitterness; it helped greatly.  Unfortunately,  It did not help the taste of the crust. This was the siciliana pie.  Who knows what the regular pizza crust is like. .. I'm not ever going back to try it. 

Ordered a chicken parmesan hero.  I think they call it a jet something stupid.  I can't even eat it.  It makes me sad.  I really, really wanted eggplant parm, but they didn't have it so I settled for chicken parm. I added extra cheese and extra chicken and mushrooms. Let's start with the mushrooms. ... canned!   The cheese.... barely saw any of it, so I hesitate to see what it would be like had I not gotten the extra cheese.  The chicken. ...oh lord.... It wasn't breaded and baked/fried. It was like a tasteless chicken from Subway. Then,  again,  we have the bitter, unseasoned sauce. The roll should have been good Italian bread but I think it was that crappy crust made soggy by the acid sauce.

Hint. ...add sugar to your sauce, \"chef\".

$32 for pizza and a hero.  That won't be happening again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty sweet. I have had the deep dish with turbo crust, and I had a steak deli boat. This place will definitely get me fat. The crust is kinda crunchy but not hard, the sauce is good and toppings are great. Not that expensive either, I'm going to work my way around their menu between all the crusts."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Charlotte...I'm from Michigan and am so glad that you are here!  Get the thick crust...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd find true Detroit-style pizza in Phoenix, but along came Jet's.  Many may be unfamiliar with this style of pizza, but those who know, know it's the best you'll find.  The deep-dish crust is buttery, caramelized and on-point.  Extremely friendly staff and owner, delivery, by-the-slice, and their prices are phenomenal.  I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"You guys are the absolute worst. Placed an online order and it was out of the delivery range - we waited an hour for our pizza finally called to check on it and you \"forgot to call us to tell us you didn't place the order\". Absolutely the worst customer service I've ever heard..not to mention that came from the manager."}
{"text":"Jet's is a solid pizza option. I would recommend going to the store to pick it up because delivery, at least for me, has never been on time. When I am craving pizza, this is definitely my go-to. Great prices and easy to share."}
{"text":"We've been searching for years to find good pizza. This isn't good--it's great!!  Seriously, we are so sick of bringing pizza home and being disappointed.  We ordered the deep dish \"four corners\" with sausage, mushrooms and onions. When was the last time the mozzarella cheese stretched?  Only problem, we should have gone for the larger size!  Every component of this pizza was perfect.  Can't wait to order Jet's again!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on a rainy night and delivery time was estimated at an hour.  No big deal, I get it.  After an hour and 40 minutes pass, we call.  Oops weve fallen beind it will be 20 minutes, they said.  No offer for discount, nothing.  We are 2 hours in and about to start knawing off each others arms but its a game now... We cant call to complain as we certainly want our pizza worth eating!  The saga continues on...."}
{"text":"Delicious deep dish pizza. Crispy, saucy, crunchy, cheesy, hot. Exactly as pizza should be."}
{"text":"Somehow it was selected I didn't want cheese online but I called up and dude said he'd remake it for me no problem. Awesome company and pizza!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the wings are tiny. I placed an order for \"three dozen wings\" and the girl that placed the order failed to mention they don't sell wings by the dozen, but they come in orders of 8's. So it was a total cost of $23.95 for 24 wings. Needless to say, I'll stick to small businesses for a good pizza and good wings."}
{"text":"After 2 tries, I'm really disappointed.  First was a slice of pepperoni to go.  It was their \"Deep Dish\" which meant deep bread but the bread was quite good.  I was hoping to sit down & have a meal but the store is just for delivery & pick-up.  Fine, that error was on me.  A few days later I went online to order as the menu suggested, but this location does not offer online ordering.  I telephoned for a delivery using the \"Family Pac\" coupon from their menu.  The person on the phone didn't know how to enter the coupon.  A different person came on and took my order for the \"Super Special\" 5-top on hand-tossed crust and a single-top thin crust (it's nice to see anchovies on the menu!) then I thought the line dropped but I was on hold again.  I was told to expect delivery in 45 minutes. It was 10-15 minutes late and the receipt showed no coupon (supposedly $3.53 savings) but the $3 delivery fee was negated.  I think some of the toppings were added part-way through baking because they were completely loose and falling off.  The sauce was watery & strangely sweet.  You'll probably want extra cheese.  There was quite a lot of oil on my plate after eating.  Honestly, frozen store-brand pizza would have been more enjoyable.  I ended up snacking on cheese & crackers and the pizzas were still on my counter the next morning."}
{"text":"Jet's offers good pizza at a good price and their service is fast.  I definitely recommend the ranch buffalo chicken pizza. It also includes bacon so you pretty much can't lose. Their hot wings are smaller in size but the sauce packs some good heat without being killer spicy and they're cooked well. A go-to for me on a lazy Sunday."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizzas i had in my life! I tried deep dish crust for the first time and it was so so good. The sauce, cheese, veggies were fresh and delicious! I feel so lucky we live close to this place! Great job!"}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome and service even better.  In our special comments we jokingly asked them to tap dance while our pizza was in the oven. When the delivery driver got there she had a video on her phone of the pizza makers tap dancing. We laughed so hard we cried!  I love you Jets pizza and will order from you again. Best pizza ordering experience ever!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the customer service I received last night from the \"Manager\" Mike. I placed a call at 9:30 p.m which was not answered until 9:31 p.m. At which point I was told that they do not deliver past 9:30 p.m. I told them I had heard good things about their pizza and that I was eager to try it. He told me that there were \"no exceptions, no delivery after 9:30....\" I was then promptly hung up on. I then called back as I was going to order it for pick-up. I asked to speak with the manager and was connected again with Mike. After explaining that I was going to come in and pick up my pizza and informing him of my dissatisfaction in the manner the previous phone call was handled, I was hung up on again. I can't say anything about the food but I will say that I will never frequent this establishment and will stick to Romeo's. Who have always been friendly, respectful and punctual.

Sincerely,

Disappointed"}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza! It is apparent that this joint uses quality ingredients when you take that first delicious bite. The crust is golden and done just right consistently.

The staff is always friendly and I feel at home when I walk in. Make no mistake this isn't someplace to get that gourmet white pizza with truffles. This is just one of the best casual pizza place to get your fix."}
{"text":"This pizza will have your stomach full in 5 slices max! It's the best deep dish pizza you'll get outside Chicago."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. The thin crust pizza was good. Service was great, and they have free WiFi while you wait."}
{"text":"Best pizza anywhere in Arizona.. Glad to finally have Detroit style pizza locally. Try it..... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Consistent and perfectly priced for the amount of food! Deep dish pizza is awesome and bread sticks are delicious! Our go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza I enjoyed it. Nice to be able to have some different pizza than dominos or papa johns. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Jet's pizza. However, I've only had PROBLEMS with this location. 

Problem #1: we ordered pizza and sodas for delivery. Upon delivery I noticed our sodas were not given. Delivery guy says \"I never got em\" umm ok? No offer to bring them to me. I called and had very rude service. Mistakes happen, I get it but they did not offer to bring me the sodas I ordered. Instead she told me shed just refund me (in a not so nice or apologetic way. In fact no apology at all).


Problem #2: the pizza is solid so weeks later we tried again. This time with pizza and salads. All was fine with the delivery- until we started eating our salads and came across a STAPLE. A big metal staple. When I called the lady was so nonchalant like I had just told her I had pepperoni on my food--rather than a STAPLE. She said \"ok what do you want a refund?\" Ummmm yeah- and maybe an explanation as to how this landed in my dinner? She again was unapologetic and only refunded me for one salad. I thought maybe she'd throw I'm another salad or a little discount on the pizza but, no. 

NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS LOCATIOM AGAIN. Ever."}
{"text":"The workers are so rude they forgot to cut our pizza and the employee was acting like it was our fault we had to go back up and leave our family party it was such an inconvenience"}
{"text":"AWESOME Pizza !!! I drive 1.5 hours to get this pie. Its pick up only I believe, no dining in, although their maybe an area to have lunch or dinner outside."}
{"text":"My goto pizza delivery.

I have a variety of pizza delivery places around me and these are the guys I always order from.  They're always on time, food is hot and the drivers have always been nice.  As for the pizzas, the Detroit style 8 corner deep crust always makes me happy, nothing to complain about.  I'm about to go order one right now.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Jets Pizza- I love you. I might even be in love with you... it's hard to say for sure, but my feelings are strong and deep. I had not heard much about Jets, but one day out of the blue we decided to try it... and it has been a life-changing experience. 

The square cut, deep dish, perfectly crispy crust is what I'm so into. You can *flavorize* the crust, for free... and I've tried both the garlic crust and the butter crust. 

I've tried speciality pizzas such as: alfredo chicken pizza, Eugenes Favorite, the Aloha BBQ (my favorite!), the BBQ chicken, and last but not least, the Philly Cheesesteak pizza. They are all superb. It would be doing my fellow Americans a disservice by not passing on how truly mouth watering this pizza is. 

I've also tried their boneless chicken salad, their boneless wings (yum), and their cheesy breads... all in the span of MAYBE two months. So, I guess you could say it's getting pretty serious."}
{"text":"This is proof that not all pizza is the same. For those who rave about the flavor and think it is reasonably priced: we will have to agree to disagree. The prices and rave reviews mislead you into thinking this is similar to the nicer pizza places we have here in AZ. Instead, the low quality ingredients and bland flavors really should lump it in with the bargain chains and sad microwave pizzas."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! We had Jet's all over west Michigan ( where I'm from ) and was super excited to have one open here! They need to build one closer to Monroe tho!"}
{"text":"DEEP. DISH. DUO. = Mouthgasm.

You can always trust they are going to arrive with your food on time, and you better believe they are going to get the order right.

These guys are professionals in their craft and will certainly give you a dish that is much to your liking.

Enjoy a nice pizza night with Jet's. And go deep dish. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good, cheap pizza.  The thick crust (and cajun seasoning) are so good. Our favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza. There's always a coupon deal for Jets, and they deliver for cheap too! It's awesome."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this Jet's location was about two years ago.  I stopped going after I ordered a Pizza an hour in advance and went to pick it up.  I went to the counter to pay and collect my order, and the guy at the counter said \"I'm sorry, we're out of bacon for your BLT pizza\".  I responded by asking why they didn't call to let me know; I did place my order an hour in advance.  He said that they did try calling me, but no one answered, and he apologized.  I walked back out to my car and looked at my phone, they had literally called me when they saw me walking in from the parking lot.  Nice save, Jet's Pizza!

Cut forward to this evening - I was coming home from working second shift and was too tired to cook.  I saw Jet's open sign lit up, along with \"Slices\".  Good deal, this will be quick and easy; besides its been a couple of years, things change, right?  I walked up to the door in six degree weather and pulled on the door - it was locked.  I look at the sign that says hours are until midnight.  I look at my watch, its 11:30, I see the guy mopping the floor and he can see me through the window.  He yells \"We're closed\".  And I replied, \"I thought you were open until midnight?\"  He said, \"It's after twelve!\"  Baffled, I looked at my watch again, yep 11:30; I pulled out my phone, same thing.  And I was like, \"I'm pretty sure it's not\".  He doesn't say anything, so I go back to my car, as I'm driving out of my parking space, he opens the door and said, \"Sorry I was looking at the wrong time, you can come in\".  Perhaps under different weather circumstances I might have, but the wind chill was -15 degrees.  I simply told him to have a nice night.

If this pizza place was anywhere else, this location would have went out of business due to their customer service; but they wisely placed themselves across the street from a medium sized hospital, so they have a captive customer base.  I worked at said hospital in the past and whenever someone ordered from them it was always a headache.  The people who own/manage this location care nothing about their customer service.  Do yourself a favor, go down the street a little ways and go to Marco's; the pizza isn't as good but they will treat you like a paying customer."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza in Arizona!!!! The staff is super friendly too. We love the deep dish turbo crust. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"How do you give a half of a star?  This place is not good.  I ordered a pizza for 2 for me and my wife.  My wife has a gluten allergy so we ordered the Gluten free pizza.  It tasted horrible.  I paid $14 for a personal size pizza that was maybe 8 inches in diameter.  It wouldn't feed me let alone the both of us.  Ridiculously overpriced for what you are getting.  You could get a better pizza at QT honestly.  We now order online from MOD Pizza that is about a half mile from this place.  All the toppings you want and the price of the pizza stays the same.  $7.97 for an 11 inch pizza.  No folks, I'm not lying.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Had this olace for the 1st time last week.. I loved it. It was g
Fresh and tasty.. The edges were crispy with cheese just the way i like it. Will definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Jet's is finally open....now I can indulge my BLT pizza cravings anytime! I love the deep dish crust and their ranch is the best! The owner, Matt, and general manager, Ben are awesome and truly love what they do.  Jet's is a wonderful addition to the area, and my new go to pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Best pizza best and service in town
 Love the deep dish and consistently great pizza! Staff is welcoming and inviting. So happy.paradise Valley area is so lucky to have them local"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Staff was friendly but unattentive. I'm sure that will improve with time. Great place. Five stars."}
{"text":"Jets has made it to Arizona!! Being a native to Michigan this makes me very happy! Best pizza I've had in almost 3 years! Go with the deep dish and Jet's bread with extra turbo crust!! Even the ranch is made right just like being back home in Michigan!!! 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town IMHO, so glad you opened in Champaign. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in awhile!  Deep dish is definitely the way to go here.  I put this right up there with Angelo's!"}
{"text":"For fast, inexpensive, delicious pizza I think Jet's is the best in the area. I can't get enough of their Jet's bread and deep dish pizza with Turbo Crust. It's nice to have a tasty option that we can have delivered and their drivers are very friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the area. Friendly staff. Almost always get the 8 corner pizza. Totally recommend it. I love turbo crust but wife doesn't care for it."}
{"text":"After experiencing a night-time pizza craving, I looked and saw that Jet's was open and delivered until 11:00 PM.  I placed my order at 10:14 PM and received a call a couple of minutes later from the restaurant, telling me that they were out of pizza and wouldn't be making my order.  That's right, Jet's Pizza was out of pizza. 

It would be much appreciated if this restaurant did not mislead their customers into thinking they were open later than they actually were.  If they want to close earlier, so be it, but do not inconvenience customers by advertising being open later than you actually are."}
{"text":"Definitely, yummy. We also got the pizza with all the crust pieces, although I thought it was called 8 corners, but whatever. It was good. Really good. I love deep dish. The cheese was gooey, the crust was tasty--crisp on the outside and doughy inside, without being too greasy or overcooked. I got mushroom and pepperoni. The mushrooms were still moist but cooked. We tried it because we bought some coupon book that a guy was selling door-to-door. We had never heard of the place, but the guy was cool, so we bought it. We got two of the 4/8 corner pizzas for $14 and change. (It basically looked like two small square pizzas pushed together. Why only three stars? 1. They're not open very late. 2. The employees don't know what's going on there. We were told we had to come and pick up the pizza when we ordered at 8:30, because it might not be ready before they closed at 9:00, and then they couldn't deliver it. What? Then they told us it would be ready in 20 minutes. What? They close at 10:00 first of all, and secondly, what? 3. We've only eaten there once, so maybe the good pizza was a fluke, since the operation seems sort of lousy.

Update: We eat here once a week or every two weeks. Everything has been fantastic. (The employees are a little out of tune, but always nice). Love this place. Upgrading to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best new pizza place in Pittsburgh. Great tasting pizza, salad, and wings!  Their deep dish is  the best ever."}
{"text":"Jet's Pizza is simply the best I've had in town. I'm a pizza lover so as soon as I moved here I tried them all. Jet's combines quality ingredients and exceptional customer service. Every time I call they are great on the phone (no 10 minute hold times), quick delivery, and the delivery guys are just impressively nice (for pizza delivery after all). The pizza when it arrives is hot and perfect. The deep dish is delicious! Highly recommend this place. If their delivery radius was a little further north life would be perfect."}
{"text":"First time trying this Jet's (have tried before at other locations).  Staff very friendly and courteous.  Had the Hawaiian pizza (deep dish) - it was excellent!  Well made, delicious, enjoyed every piece.  I will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The deep dish was fantastic.  Crust was light/crunchy on the outside and soft inside without being overly doughy.  The Italian sausage, mild pepper, green olive and onion ingredients were fresh and evenly spread over the large pizza.  Delivery person was quick and friendly.  Will definitely order again and highly recommend to those who like deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Andy at Jet's in Parma on Broadview Road is awesome!  He takes my crazy orders and they always come out perfect! I love their pizza and service!  I'm so happy that they opened this location close to my house!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times.  The wait is always terrible. Their deep dish is pretty good but you have to get the turbo crust. Their regular pizza is terrible and the wings are a joke.   For a chain it's about middle of the road. Nothing crazy not sure what all the hype is"}
{"text":"This place is REALLY GROSS. They only wear gloves when they are making the sub sandwiches, but they do not when they are making the pizzas. This makes no sense whatsoever. Unless you like teenager's bare hands all over your food I would definitely stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Good square pizza.  You can get a couple slices and a drink for a reasonable price any time you want it."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Jet's and will order from them online again! Delivery was fast and pizza was hot! We ordered the large deep dish with mushrooms, onions, sausage and feta. It was good but I prefer fresh mushrooms over canned which is the only negative about our order.

We will be ordering from Jet's again.

Oh! Check there website as they lost coupons."}
{"text":"Love the deep dish pizza. The crust was unique and the flavor was really special. We had a party and no one had tried it previously but I converted at least a dozen friends"}
{"text":"Best freaking \"thicker\" pizza on the west side! Must get the 8corner pizza! The crust is the buttery and crispy with burnt cheese on the corners!"}
{"text":"We used to order Jets all the time. Overtime, quality has gone way down and prices are way up. Tonight a 2 topping medium pizza and 2 subs delivered was $32. I had my husband call back to make sure that was correct. The subs and pizza were just average. And another thing I have noticed is their food does not reheat well at all. I think we are done with Jets."}
{"text":"Kept meaning to try Jet's and finally did. Started out with a slice of the deep dish. I was hooked!  Have been very happy with pizza; the other day I ordered a veggie pizza.  Everything was delicious as usual except for the mushrooms. They were rubbery-obviously not fresh. Somewhat of a disappointment. Suggest using fresh mushrooms and then will be perfect."}
{"text":"Good pan pizza. My husband says it's like upgraded Pizza Hut. The toppings are plentiful, the prices are right. Quick delivery. New family fav"}
{"text":"At work we love to order Jets since it's conveniently close. The flavor is just great. I like ordering the two slices of pizza (that are really big) that comes with a soda because it's under 7 bucks. Sometimes ordering on the phone is an issue because I've experienced a lot of errors with this store.  Forgetting ranch,  given the wrong soda,  and for when we order a large pizza they never seem to get it right for what we want on each half of the pizza."}
{"text":"Gave jets another try. This time I ordered extra sauce, plus another side order of sauce. After the last sauce less pizza I wasn't taking any chances. Much better pizza this time! I'm still not giving it a great rating though. Ordered and extra side of ranch with my boneless wings and only received one but was charged for the extra. Maybe better next time Jets?"}
{"text":"Do you ever suffer from pizza indifference?  You crave pizza, yet have already run thorough the obvious options, and don't really care what you choose, as long as it's dough with tomato sauce and cheese?  

We just happened to be a stone throw's away, and this is how my husband and I ended up picking up a deep dish rectangle pie from Jet's. 

Perhaps this review is a bit premature since I haven't tried their thin or hand tossed crusts, but I feel eating a good 6 pieces of this doughy, crispy pizza and becoming a full-fledged bloat-dette for the evening, I am fully qualified to write a review. 

The key to Jet's is to get the pizza piping hot.  We got outs straight out of the oven, the cheese was practically bubbling when we got it.  The crust is super crunchy on the outside with a nice amount of grease, then doughy (but fully cooked) on the inside. Not too much sauce, but lots of cheese, sprinkled to the edges, and baked to an even crispier bonus cheese crisp. 

Overall, this is like an amped-up version of a Pizza Hut pizza.  Let's make no qualms about it.  It's a chain, it's efficient, and I though pretty cheap.  Would have liked a little more sauce, or maybe more spice in the sauce, but overall, I can't complain.  Carb lovers unite!

TIP: There are PLEN-T of coupons out there, or if you don't have one, just ask the cashier if they can apply a special for you."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza if you can actually get it in your hands; However we have had so many service issues related to this particular location that we have stopped trying to go to it all together. Orders are frequently incorrect, longer than expected, or in one case, forgotten about completely."}
{"text":"I don't normally love deep dish pizza, but this pizza is really good. It's tasty, with good amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings.

One night when I was on my way home from a late night at work, I stopped at Jets and ordered a small pizza. By the time I got it home, it was after midnight, but I realized that they'd forgotten to put sauce on it. Having worked in the service industry for a long time, I understand that mistakes happen, especially late on a Saturday night. I called, and the owner spoke to me, and asked if I could bring the pizza back in, which I did. Obviously it was obnoxious to have to go back out, but he was extremely helpful. He refunded my money, and gave me a large remade pizza for free, along with a soda. He was also genuinely apologetic -- in fact, you could tell he was mortified. He used it as a training opportunity with his staff, which is constructive.

Although I try not to eat pizza with too much frequency, I'd highly recommend this place for not only the flavor, but also their business ethic, and the convenience of their hours."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Charlotte...price is very reasonable.. . product is excellent.  Had the pizza at the Pizza Wars...hands down the best there is in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the pizza, especially with Turbo Crust. The deep dish is awesome, but when I get it I find it to he very filling after 2 squares...so I usually order rounds.

This store has been around the neighborhood a while, and STILL DOESN'T HAVE ONLINE ORDERING. It's ridiculous at this point. \"Coming Soon\" my ass. 

It bothers me alot, because I would rather skip the lifeless cyborgs of people taking your order and just order it myself. Not only do they sound unpleasant 95% of the time, but they hardly ever repeat your order back to you. That needs to be done ALWAYS. I shouldn't have to ask, and I expect to be right when I pick it up. I'm sure I will have a problem with that soon. 

Pizza is great, but the customer service sucks shit."}
{"text":"Where do I start?   Being a Detroit Born and Raised man, Jets is my Go to every time I go home for a visit.  Now they are in AZ?   YES PLEASE.   Nothing has changed.   Still the best 2000 miles away.   I met the Owner and she is wonderful.  Big store.   New menu items that I never saw in Detroit.   Excited to finally have another home grown location here in the Valley.   Had a friend who has never had Jets, try it last night, and he over did it, he loved the deep dish so much, said he will be going back for sure.    Thanks again Jets."}
{"text":"As far as chain pizza goes, this is as good as it gets.  Turbo Crust in the Jam and I dig the jalapeno cheddar dipping sauce"}
{"text":"Best pie around hands down, kind and Courteous staff always makes ordering pizza easy"}
{"text":"Jet's Pizza in Dormont, PA is exceptional, I always get a 4 corner pizza with either mushroom or pepperoni and there's a delivery driver named Ryan who is extremely friendly and always calls me when he's about to arrive at my house. By the way did I mention the crust, it is addictive, litterally. I don't know what they do but it's chewy and crunchy at the same time."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. Been there multiple times but last time I went to pick up, I was asked for a tip explicitly which is extremely unprofessional and unreasonable. And when I didn't, the guy made a snarky comment. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The 8 corner is awesome!  We order sheet pizza from here before and it is not your typical sheet pizza. It's really good!! Can't review on delivery speed, I always pick it up because we don't live in the delivery area. Wings and cheesy bread are good also.  I do like Marco's wings better though.  Definately one of the best pizza delivery places around."}
{"text":"Great place to eat pizza in Matthews friendly ambiance and very clean. Great to bring the kids. I own a barbershop at 930 Park Center Dr suit 104 and love this place.

{"text":"Two nights ago I had the worst pizza I have ever tasted from anywhere. I was excited that Jets was advertising a N.Y. style pizza. I had tried Dominos version and it was decent but decided to give Jets a shot. Huge mistake, took pizza almost an hour to get to me, it was cold, way too salty and whoever cooked it had obviously never been inside a NYC pizzeria. It wasn't close. Had one slice, fed the rest to the dog and ordered Dominos."}
{"text":"Deep Dish Turbo Crust YUM!   Owner is super friendly and has delivered outside their normal delivery area for me numerous times.  My new favorite pizza joint."}
{"text":"Just came back from 2nd trip to Jets pizza to correct my order and get the refund for being over-charged. The woman who I'm assuming is the manager told me the boy on the phone who took the order was incorrect.  After a very lengthy discussion I was refunded the over- charged amount and took my luke-warm pizzas home.  The woman (manager) never once apologized. The pizza tastes good but having to make 2 trips and spending 20 minutes arguing about an over-charge doesn't make it   worth it.  My opinion is customer service is as or more important than taste."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for the first time from Jets!  Turbo sticks were phenomenal and deep dish was delicious.  Best of all was the awesome service the employee AJ gave us.  We were greeted with a big smile and someone who was genuine and helpful in explaining the different options.  Thanks for the great service AJ and thanks for the great tasting food Jet's.  We will definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"This location is very inconsistent! I ordered an 8 corner cheese & a cheese only bold fold last Monday, & it was excellent. Ordered the same thing the other day, & it was over cooked & barely any sauce on it. 
I've given them several tries, & just can't go back to them any more. First time they screwed up my bold fold order was over a year ago. A discount on my next purchase wouldn't cut it, & I didn't want a refund. I just didn't visit it again till my boyfriend came into town. He loves Jets, so I gave it another try.
Never again...there are better Jets locations out there. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Wow. Worst service ever. 
Placed an order to go. Or order rarely changes. And, I know they keep track of people's order history. 
Ordered food like this:
1 - Bold fold - cheese only 
2 - 8 corner cheese only
3 - Regular bone in bbq wings
4 - 2 liter diet Pepsi
Jet's employee repeat's back on order:
1 - Bold fold - cheese only 
2 - 8 corner cheese only
3 - Regular bone in with bbq sauce on the side
4 - 2 liter diet Pepsi
Me: No, we don't want the bbq sauce on the side. We want them on the wings.
Jet's employee - ok. We have them on the wings.
Me: Perfect.
Asks Jet's employee to read back order:
1 - Bold fold - cheese only 
2 - 8 corner cheese only
3 - Regular bone in bbq wings
4 - 2 liter diet Pepsi
Me: Perfect - total?
Jet's employee: $40
We get there. Price is different. Reads back order - 8 corner now missing. We end up getting 2 slices, that look \"old\". 
When we get back to our hotel, I find pepperoni on my bold fold.
Mind you, we order from Jet's all them time, when we are on the road. This has been our order for the past few weeks. 
Why complain, when we are NEVER going back there. Worst one we have ever been to."}
{"text":"First off, let me just say that this place is a solid pizza joint. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Deep Dish Pizza with a Cajun Crust. It was pretty solid, although not like traditional Chicago style deep dish (think more of a thick crust that's a little softer).

Pros of this place:
-You can pick like 8 different styles of crust for FREE
-They have 3 different styles of pizza (Thin crust, Thicker crust, Deep Dish)
-They have a great selection of types of pizza
-Wasn't overly pricey

Cons of this place:
-Can't eat inside (only takeout/delivery)
-Pizza was good, but had kind of a \"fast food\" feel
-Small pizza was an in between size (more than enough for one person, but not enough for 2 ...)

Overall, I gave this place 3 stars because it was a solid choice. I will go back. However, if I'm really in the mood for a pizza-ish meal that's BBQ Chicken, I'll just go to DP Dough. It's a little cheaper and closer. But, I will order from a group from this place."}
{"text":"Everyone at my house loves jets pizza. To feed 3 kids and get no complaints isnt easy. I live in a midrise building with a call entry system. I leave simple instructions on my online order and they never act like they couldn't figure out how to get in or act like coming up an elevator to get to my door is a pain. They deliver with a smile and are always polite even with being younger. Thank you for the continued great food and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, especially the deep dish. I called with a coupon from one of those Citipass books and had no trouble using it. I did pick up and the pizza was ready by the time I got there and they got the order exactly right. No issues at all."}
{"text":"I will ONLY eat pizza if it is made at Jet's! I AM SERIOUSLY NOT A FAN of pizza but I have to say that their 8 corner deep dish pizza is seriously THE BEST!!    I won't even bother trying to eat a slice of pizza if it comes from any other place then Jet's because I know I won't like it!"}
{"text":"We recently ordered delivery from Jet's after hearing so many positive things about them. The employee that answered the phone when I placed our order quoted us with a 65 minute delivery time. We were okay with that, so we went ahead and placed the order. 

75 minutes later and we still hadn't received our order. I called Jet's and they told me that they were swamped with deliveries and that we were misquoted on our delivery time. I understand that everyone has an off night once in awhile, but they could have at least called to let us know. He ended the phone call saying that we'd have it \"shortly\". Okay, no problem. 

15 minutes after that, and still no delivery. I called the restaurant again and the same employee from the previous call answered the phone. I explained that we still hadn't gotten our order, to which he then sort of stated with an attitude that our order would be free. I thanked him and then asked him why they didn't call us to let us know why we had been misquoted on our delivery time. He brushed the question off, not really giving an answer. 

10 minutes after that (35 minutes after our original quoted time), our driver, who was very polite and apologetic, arrived. He then repeated to us that the order was on them.

We ordered a large cheese pizza, bread sticks, and a salad. The pizza and bread sticks were both hot and delicious, and the salad was great as well. 

Overall, despite our food arriving over a half hour later than quoted, we will give Jet's another try due to the fantastic food and the courteous service from the delivery driver."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Charlotte! The deep dish is fantastic. The crust has the perfect crunch and the toppings (I've had all kinds of pizza there) are always good! The wings are good but have a ton of sauce on them, just to warn you! One more thing, this pizza tastes really good as leftovers, even cold!"}
{"text":"I will not pretend that I am a food critic by any means, however I do have a very serious love affair going on with food.  That being said, I LOVE Jet's pizza!! Deep dish is to die for, personally I like mine with light sauce and extra cheese! Their Cinna-sticks are AMAZING!  

So glad we have such a wonderful pizza place that you can also dine in at.  The place has always been clean and the staff have always been friendly!"}
{"text":"I love pizza and was close by and decided to stop at the location on Arizona ave. 

I was a little judgmental at first its not fancy or anything on the inside, a few chairs and tables so this place mostly gets carry out orders I'm guessing.

The food...I love pizza as I've already said and I was not dissapointed with this place it was hot and fresh and they have flavored crust ( butter,garlic and Romano cheese) AMAZING will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First off I'd like to say when I first moved here I was impressed with their pizza, nice quality, excellent service, very helpful. However after my last order I shall NEVER order from them again!! My fiancé and I ordered a pizza from them on a Sunday at 8:40pm, they told us it was more than enough time to get it to us, even though they closed at 10. 10:30 rolled around and they still hadn't shown up so we called them the next morning and the lady that answered was quite rude on the phone, so we asked to speak with the manager, he wasn't in at the time but she said she would have him 'call' us as soon as he got in. We never got a call. So I researched one of their corporate offices to file a complaint, guess what, when they say 'your business is important to us' they don't really mean it. And the reason for that is we had sent in that complaint we waited the 3 business days, it's been two weeks now. So in conclusion, Jet's is undeserving for even the corner of the star. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!                (Oh by the way, Jet's, next time the customer is 
distraught, take the blame and fix it. That's what a 'good' establishment does.)"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint near my house. My neighbor told me about it and now I have to go once a week. The 4 corner pizza cooked well done with extra sauce is delicious. Friendly staff and the owner is awesome too."}
{"text":"Order delivery and always have to remind them to give me the dipping sauce. Tonight delivery man said he'd be right back, after 12 minutes (I live 4 mins away) I called. Lady who answered the phone was rude, short, and didn't even apologize. Asked me if I still wanted it (really?!) after I told her yes and that he had told me he'd be back with it, she then says he's on his way (lies, why would you ask if I still want it?!). Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Their deep dish with the garlic crust is everything!!! Loved it so much. I also love that they use fresh veggies. A lot of the pizza delivery spots have stopped using real ingredients. Highly recommend Jet's!"}
{"text":"Jet's delivered 7 pizzas to our party last night right on time as pre-arranged and all thin crust pizzas were wonderful and hot on arrival.  We will use them again numerous times in the future.

The staff was friending and very helpful and even helped figure out what coupons were relevant which greatly reduced their already reasonable price."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. Always fresh, crispy, and plentiful of toppings. My family and I go here many times theoughout a month time span. Always a positive experience. Oh and the salad is good too!!"}
{"text":"We got pizza here for a work lunch.  We ordered one regular pizza, one with pepperoni and a buffalo chicken pizza.  They were all really yummy!  You can order online which is perfect for work lunches and they deliver.

When you are placing your order online, you can customize every detail of the pizza - down to how much sauce you want/how thin you want your crust!  Everyone loved the pizza and we're definitely ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Love jet's pizza! their deep dish is wonderful, it may be a little greasy but that's the best kind of pizza right?? Also if you have not tried it, I HIGHLY recommend the turbo crust because it is to die for!!! We order here about twice a month and am always excited for it"}
{"text":"The 8 corner pizza is the best! I'm addicted and so are all my friends. The other crusts aren't as impressive. But I can't rave enough about the 8 corner!!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. Not deep dish like Chicago but,like we called it back East, Sicilian. Thick bread with the normal amount of cheese and toppings. Crust was crispy on the edges and airy soft in the middle. 

This is take out out only. It's a great way to relax at home and have a bottle of vino with some pizza. It was fresh and hot upon pick up. The salads were ok. Straight up iceberg with light selection on the toppings. 

We will go back!"}
{"text":"Couldn't believe our eyes leaving Home Depot and saw a jets pizza sign, turned around to come check it out. Wanted to know if it was the same Jets from Michigan, and low and behold it was, the owners were working and they both were awesome and the pizza was awesome just like home"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!!  In my opinion...the BEST pizza in the world!!  Phoenix, do yourself a favor and check this place out!  The crust is unbelievable...crispy and VERY tasty. The sauce and cheese are also outstanding.  Great staff too....stop in and say hello to Matt and try this awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"the good-  clean, great service, 1 block from my house, it is better than pizza hot, dominoes and papa johns

the bad-  it is average pizza, it is over priced"}
{"text":"Great price, great management, I had a complaint and it was resolved immediately which to me says a lot! I know they care about their customers. Plan on bringing my kids with me next time I come!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price! The wings are to die for! The deep pan is fantastic and our favorite! Our new pizza place! Glad to have you in the neighborhood! Fast delivery too. A++!"}
{"text":"I gave them a 2 the pizza was a 5 however the lady working the register had a attitude and was the most rude person I have ever encountered at a restaurant I had lunch there yesterday also and she was the same way so because of this I will not be back."}
{"text":"I don't give reviews unless very bad or very good. This pizza is terrible. Bland and they use canned mushrooms!! With so many choices out there don't waste your money here.  This review was for an order of hand tossed and deep dish. We asked for the turbo crust on both but they only put it on one, missing the other.  Yeeechhhh."}
{"text":"Jets is my favorite local pizza joint.  As far as delivery, the food is always delivered on time and hot.  I've never had an issue with a rude driver.  The food is also very good.  I love the deep dish pizza and the fact that you can add extra sauce if you want.  The boneless chicken is really good, especially the BBQ.  I also really like the cinnamon sticks.  The delivery app is well put together and easy to use."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, I received delivery from them for years. Tried to place a typical order online recently and they suddenly don't deliver to my neighborhood (Grier Heights). It's in a \"blackout area\" and they deny they ever delivered in the first place. Just forget the hundreds of dollars of business I've given them over the years. Racist assholes."}
{"text":"Good quality Pizza. They look out for the customer every time. Each time we have gone they have offered up free coupons with out us requesting them. Pizza fills you up. I recommend the turbo crust!"}
{"text":"Congratulations Jets. Placed a delivery order tonight at 6:00p. Called at 7:15p for status as nothing arrived to find out you entered the order for pickup. You had one job and you failed miserably, but at least you sounded remorseful... Not! Cold day in Hell before you ever see an order from this address again..."}
{"text":"Damn you Jets! Now I'm getting fat... This is my fault, not yours. I just crave that pizza. I'll try my best to limit my intake to 1-2 pizzas a month, instead of the weekly event that it's become. Great pizza, not a fan of the meats so much, best mushrooms in town (pizza wise)"}
{"text":"First time ordering Jet's Pizza. I ordered delivery. These guys did a great job! It was on time, hot and fresh. I ordered the build your own pan pizza and in unlike the D and PJ, they got it right to include the garlic butters. Also they sent plates, red pepper, parmesan cheese and a couple of nice mini footballs. When is the last time you got more than you asked for from a pizza place? Nice job Jets!"}
{"text":"Not your typical chain pizza. What's the difference? Their crust is light and airy, not doughy and heavy like most places. Jet's has been a welcome addition to the neighborhood and will be stiff competition to the Donato's up the street."}
{"text":"I ordered from this location a few days ago and my experience was less that enjoyable.  First I placed an order online for one of their veggie pizzas.  Online it outlined what was on the pizza and left out quite a few toppings that ended up on the pizza when it arrived.  In addition I included some special instructions for the pizza which were completely ignored.  After 1.5 hours of waiting for my pizza on a Sunday night it finally arrived completely wrong. I called them and they did not even offer to have their driver come back out with the correct pizza.  I ended up having to drive to their location (completely defeating the purpose of delivery) to get another pizza.  In addition they would not give me the new pizza without me returning the old pizza(as if they could use it for another order....)  After arriving back home again we open the pizza box and they messed up the pizza again.(probably should have checked before leaving the store)  We just bit the bullet and ate it anyways because we were so sick of this whole ordeal.  I probably will not be ordering from this location ever again."}
{"text":"As a Westlake resident, I have tried every pizza place in the city. This is one of my favorites, by far. I really like their salads, they are full of ingredients and above par in comparison to other pizza places. By the way, for $1 you can add extra chicken to them too. I don't even like extra meat, but for $1, I can't resist. 

I think their pizza is just delish. It's made with a thicker crust than most, but don't let that scare you away if your into thin crust normally. There is something special about this pie, please try. Also, for free you can add 'turbo' to your crust (or any other flavor you want). It is garlic, butter and parmesan flavored crust and is not overwhelming at all, just a hint of extra flavors. 

Crazy sh*t is.... at lunch you can get two slices or pie and a 20 oz of soda for $4. So bad (for you), yet so good at the same time."}
{"text":"My first visit. Its take out or delivery only - no dine in. Reasonably priced. Good & friendly service. I wanted to try the deep dish - it was very good for a chain shop. Crispy edges and fluffy crust & sweet sauce. I would definitely stop back again."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Pizza is delicious !
Its like nothing I have ever tasted before.  I have had so many other versions of buffalo chicken pizza.. but this pizza was no doubt different.   It was cooked just right and there was just a sprinkle of bacon on it..  not too over powering but so very tasty."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service extremely slow.  Why tell someone pick up at 5 and the foods not ready till 5:20?  Plus the girl with the drawn on angry eyebrows is incompetent.  As I waited for my food every order that had more than one pizza she tried to send out incomplete.  Everyone had to ask for their sub or salad or what ever.  The had 4 people in the kitchen, 2 at the counter plus the manager plus the drivers.  Forgot why I stopped coming here, tonight reminded me why."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great employees at the chandler location.  I have eaten at Jets in Michigan and I am happy to see they made it to Arizona.  My first choice for pizza and I have a twenty minute drive to get it."}
{"text":"Detroit style pizza in az.  Now if we had buddy's life would be complete.  Thank you jets."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews :( we got delivery from here the other night and after it was 30 minutes late we called to see what was wrong. They said they had to remake the pizza and that it would be there in 10 to 15 minutes. 20 minutes later they got to us...delivery guy handed us the wrong order and said it was late because they were super busy...hmmm different than what they said on the phone....finally we got our pizza and it tasted disgusting. Super burnt :( they offered us $10 towards our next visit, but we obviously won't ever be back. Sad :("}
{"text":"I stopped in to try the lunch slice special.  It was as it is advertised.  2 slices of either pepperoni, sausage or cheese and a bottled drink for an even $5.  I chose a slice of pepperoni & sausage.  I am very picky when it comes to sausage on a pizza and this sausage was very good too me.  The pizza didn't remind me of Garcia's.  The two crusts and flavors are very different.  I really don't like Garcia's sausage at all.  I always pick if off.

The pizza left my hands and face feeling very greasy and that totally grossed me out!!

They have no napkins so make sure you are prepared for that.  

I would like to note that someone in our office ordered the Hawaiian pizza for delivery and I tried a slice of it and I thought it was really tasty but then again the grease is what mainly gets me down.  I would like to try the thin crust so I might change the star rating if I think it improves."}
{"text":"I've resided in the area of \"Cleveland\" for about six months now. It's where I'm establishing roots. Having said that, there are a TON of pizza joints in the area. There are two (maybe three) in the general area that I can say I like. This is one of them. I don't know how to explain it. It's got a nice crisp texture to it and a heartiness about it. I approve."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong I like Jets pizza. I'm from Detroit but delivery is not good. It's been an hour and 15 minutes we called to check said driver was on their way. Well that was 15 min ago and we live maybe 10 minutes away. No apology. Also they have you tip prior- at this point seems unfair"}
{"text":"Not being one for thick crust pizza, I was a little disappointed that deep dish was the only crust option when purchasing single slices of pizza. I'm a thin & crispy crust lover, and don't judge, but Pizza Hut is one of my faves!  I stopped here after seeing reviews and went ahead with the 2 slices of deep-dish pizza lunch. It was SOOOOO GOOD - crunchy ends, enough cheese - just wonderful! It was like a flashback of Charlotte in the 1970's for me, of going to La Srada Pizza on Central Avenue - back when it used to be GOOD!  Back to my Jet's review, I may have to branch out and get their full size deep dish pizza.  I'm telling you, that crust was amazing!  That being said, I also can't wait to try their thin crust pizza - looks like they have a great selection. 
I also ordered a Greek salad. Wasn't especially impressed with it and did not care for their Greek dressing at all; I've had worse - but also have had much better.  I will def be trying their wings the next time I go."}
{"text":"This hit the spot! Being 19 weeks pregnant I find myself getting hangry more often. I had been craving 2 slices of cheese pizza all day. I was so happy to find a place that sold by the slice that was close to me. Jets Pizza chased the hangry monster away and me one happy pregnant lady! Now....where's the bathroom? I gotta potty."}
{"text":"Jets pizza is just like the pizza you get from Jets in the Detroit Metropolitan area. It's so good my husband drives 15mins to pick up a pizza. It's a deep dish pizza. It has its own distinct taste, not as heavy as a Chicago deep dish. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I think I am addicted to Jets Pizza after finally trying some Super Special slices yesterday (pepperoni, canadian bacon, green peppers, onions).

Unlike other reviewers, I did not have a greasy experience. Instead, the deep dish dough reminded me a little bit of Lou Malnati's because the crust tasted like it had a hint of white wine. I also like good pizza crust and thus was not disappointed with my Jets slices.

Parking available, delivery available, not a sit down restaurant. Check your mailbox for coupons. Also, the lunch special is a good deal with 2 slices of either cheese, sausage, pepperoni, or the special of the day and a 20 ounce bottled drink for $5 with tax."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST PIZZA I've ever had. Every time I go back to the midwest it's always the first thing I want to eat. I can't believe I didn't know there was a Jets in AZ. I grew up eating this pizza and absolutely nothing compares. I've had all of the fancy pizza places in Scottsdale and they are not even half as good as Jets. If you've never had it, you must get a large pepperoni. Don't get round either, must get the square! Service was fast. Picked up an order and it even felt nostalgic inside with the white and red tiles. Thanks to the owner who brought this chain into the valley."}
{"text":"In the area visiting my daughter and she suggested Jet's . Very disappointed. Sub par toppings. Got the large with 2 toppings and it was $21 and some change for pick up. Sauce tastes like it came out of a jar. No taste what so ever. Onions were diced and not cooked very much. A good frozen pizza may have been better. It was late on a Thursday around 9:30pm"}
{"text":"Detroit style deep dish with turbo crust and Jet Bread. Jet's has always been my favorite 'chain' pizza. So glad they are finally in AZ."}
{"text":"i order pizza and they gave me the opposite order. i ordered a deep dish pizza with green peppers. i got thin crust with ham green peppers and onions. guess i'm not getting any. in my opinion they usually don't mess up orders so i don't know why they did this time."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! Sooo good! Friendly service! I had heard good things, but was skeptical. We wanted pizza one night, so I decided to give Jets a try. They delivered to me outside their delivery area, and I was blown away by the food. We normally get Oregano's or NYPD, and this is as good or better. Got 2 deep dish pizzas, and some cheese bread. I never knew I was in love with Detroit style pizza until I tried Jets! This will be our new go-to delivery place for pizza! I will be telling all my neighbors & friends about it too. It sounds a little weird, but try the BLT Pizza. My wife's a mostly vegetarian, but eats bacon if it's super crispy. I asked them to \"murder the bacon\" and my wife loved it! I'm a carnivore, and I'll order the BLT pizza again just for me, it was tasty. We also got the aloha bbq chicken pizza, which was easily the best bbq pizza I've ever had. Just amazing! Every Other Pizza Place in Town Has Just Been Put on Notice Jets Pizza is in Town And They Are Better Than you, and reasonably priced. Once You go Jets, You Never go Back!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from Jet's for the first time this past weekend. My mother in law (MIL) has been raving about it, and, well, let's just say she's steered me wrong in the past...so I was skeptical, to say the least. We ordered a large pepperoni for the kids (ages 2 - 6) and a small pepperoni, banana pepper, and bacon pizza for the adults. You also get to choose what type of seasons (butter, garlic, oregano, etc.) you want on your pizza. Salivating? Yeah, I was too while I was on the phone. All the while though, I was thinking about those times that my MIL has steered me wrong with recommendations, I was hoping that this time, the curse would be lifted and I would be sent to Pizza Heaven.

Upon picking up the pizza, I was really impressed by the cleanliness and organization taking place. After I picked up the pizza, I of course had to take a sneak peek look before we arrived to our final destination. As I cracked the box, steam shot out and that smell hit my nostrils. WOW, I thought. Please MIL, don't be wrong! Don't be wrong!! After sinking my teeth into that first bite, my taste buds rejoiced to the heavens, while I looked at my stomach which I could literally see growing as each mother watering bite was deposited ever so gently into my stomach. The point is, this pizza is the bomb and I will be quenching my weekly pizza addiction with Jet's until I discover the next best thing...which I'm not sure I'll be able to find that..."}
{"text":"I had their version of a meat lovers pizza.  It was 20 bucks for a pizza, but I ate of that thing for DAYS and it was delicious.  Hands down, it was the best Sicilian style pizza I've had this side of the Mississippi.  It's hard to believe this is a chain.
I'd suggest calling in the order ahead of time, as it takes 20+ minutes to cook."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, found the staff very helpful and gave off a good and friendly vibe. 
I will definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"It is hard to describe how horrible the pizza is here. Let me try:  overpriced($12 for a 10 inch thin crust pizza-really), greasy, lack of toppings, strange tasting, but mostly overpriced. A 10 inch pizza, that is essentially a personal sized pizza for $12 is outrageous. Many of the reviews rave that their pizza is real East Coast pizza. Sorry, it is not even close, but then Arizonans don't know what real pizza is. Save your time and money and get a frozen pizza for $6 at the grocery store.   You'll enjoy it more and keep some of your money."}
{"text":"Never heard of jets pizza before. Went in and they gave me a free slice. It was delicious. I ordered an 8 corner yesterday, very good as well. Try the turbo crust"}
{"text":"Ordered Jets pizza half Super Special and half Hawaiian. My boyfriend and I ordered a small because the woman over the phone said it would be great for two people. Now I will say I have never had deep dish pizza and I'm pretty much an Arizona native. I do not know what \"real\" deep dish pizza is supposed to be like. 

With that being said, this pizza was so delicious! The super special is equivalent to \"the works\" or combo style. The toppings were extremely tasty and I loved that the crust was slightly burnt. Added that stone burn taste to it that really takes it to the next level. Not at all greasy either which I was surprised. I did wish there was more sauce because most of the bite you take is of bread but maybe that's how deep dish is supposed to be? 

I was kinda bumped that they only delivered within three miles because this area is very much farm land and there's a lot of us that are further down the road. Anyway I would recommended jets pizza to anyone who is looking for a full belly and plans on staying in afterwards because man you'll be full!"}
{"text":"Where to start.. Jets was highly recommended by a friend.  My first visit was yesterday.  It was a little difficult to locate but mission accomplished.  The inside is clean and comfortable with a couple of big screen TV's to watch sports.  The two things that made me a fan were the pizza and the owner, Todd Martinez is a great guy who really promoted his business and had a sincere focus on customer satisfaction.  My son and I had a sub and a calzone.  Both were very good and we took a pizza home for the rest of the family.  We are all fans and I highly recommend a visit to see for your self.  We brought home the deep dish style pizza, not quite like Chicago Deep Dish, but very good.  Nice thick and crispy crust with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Great deep-dish pizza. Toppings have good flavor and the crust is amazing. This area needed a good pizza place that delivers and we finally have one. You can't go wrong with these guys. The only problem you'll have is whether to order the L or XL. Thx guys."}
{"text":"Jets used to be the best but is slowly going downhill, tonight was so bad , I wish they go back to what it used to be"}
{"text":"Great pizza when hot, problem is last 3 delivery's where barely warm, said something this last time and driver shrugged his shoulders as oh well.
Done with the $5 tips for drivers at this place and done with deliveries there as well ...
Out of oven pizza here is fabulous but don't ask for anything more that that..."}
{"text":"Jets Pizza is awesome. I love the deep dish pizzas they create. Full of flavor and variety. Not a long wait either. The guys here are great and give wonderful service."}
{"text":"Jet's Pizza has some of the best crust I have ever had. A good value. The cheese and toppings are average. I would suggest Jet's to anyone looking for a decent mid-range pizza."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars to a chain pizza place does sound kind of ridic, right?  But, Jets - I can't resist! The 8-Corner pizza is probably the best big chain pizza I've had, ever.

It's horrible for you - but it's so, so, so good! The crust is that fabulous greasy, crispy that Pizza Hut of olden times used to have. The sauce is good and it's never been overwhelming. We've only ever had the Pepperoni (or the Spicy Pepperoni) which are both delish. They offer flavored crusts - my vote is the Turbo - it's a combo of the Butter, Garlic, and Romano.

It seems like at all times they are running an $11.99, 8-Corner special. Just tell them you have the coupon - they have never asked me for it.

The staff has always been friendly when I go in to pick up and my order has always been right (gotta knock on wood now, right?). We've had it delivered once and it was quick and still fresh!

A+ Jets, thank you!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top 5 pizza places. I don't get it often because they aren't in my delivery address but every chance I get, I have to have a Jet's fix! I've had no issues at those particular location, they are always great."}
{"text":"Good pizza, love the online ordering. Placed our order while driving in a couple counties out. It was ready when we arrived. Didn't have any coupons but was still given a discount at purchase. Saved me three bucks  Much appreciated! They've filled the void of Village Inn and Papa Dels on the West Side."}
{"text":"This pizza place used to be so good! Unfortunately their quality and customer service has gone down-hill. They gave me the wrong supreme pizza, charged me extra for pepperoni on it even though they didn't put pepperoni on the pizza. I called them about the mistake and they asked me to bring the pizza back while they made me the \"correct\" supreme pizza. I had company over and still had to drive back to pickup the pizza for Jet's mistake. I wasn't offered any discounts, free pizza, anything. The double cheese pepperoni pizza I had ordered hardly had any cheese on it (even though they charged me for extra cheese) and was burned. My guests were very disappointed and said they would never order from here again. This was the worst experience I've had from Jet's with poor quality food and poor quality customer service. Luckily there are plenty of pizza places in town with better customer service and actually put cheese on a double cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was our go to for pizza in Chicago and was pumped to find it here when we moved to Wisconsin. The 8 corner pizza is the best. Thick crust without being too heavy, nice crisp to it, good ingredients and sauce. For an under $20 pizza this is absolutely the way to go."}
{"text":"Love Jet's Pizza because it reminds me of Michigan.  The square deep dish pizza is very much a Detroit-style pie.  Monday special is a great deal ... $5 for a small pizza with up to 5 toppings!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Jet's Pizza for a long time, but I so rarely order pizza to go that it's taken years.  Finally hubs was in the mood for pizza, and we were driving back wet and exhausted from getting caught in a huge thunderstorm in the mountains and so I got on my phone and went through their online ordering tool en route. It was awesome how many different customizations you can select for your pizza- thin crust, regular or deep dish (yes!), what flavorization you want that crust, do you want regular, light or heavy sauce or cheese (or none?), and how you like your crust baked. It brings a whole new meaning to the word personalized pan pizza! So I went ahead and paid for it and the tip/delivery online so we didn't have to worry about having cash. Maybe Domino's or Papa John's other delivery places have all these options but their quality isn't like Jet's so I wouldn't know. The best part? They give you a projected time while you're going through the checkout process so we could time it perfectly to arrive 2 minutes after we got in the door. Perfecto! And the delivery guy was spot-on too.

Far and away, it had more flavor than the standard ol' pizza from say Hawthornes or the like and the deep dish is a nice novelty.  My husband loved the Buffalo Chicken and I made a custom pie.  My only complaint is I would like a few more topping options like spinach, broccoli, basil, etc. 

The only other downside was that for 2 small deep dish pizzas the bill including tip was $32 which seemed like a lot. The deep dish pizza is pretty filling though so I'd suggest instead of 2 custom smalls, get 1 large and do the toppings on half the pizza with your pizza partner (you can do that too in the cart) and you should save a lotta dough. Pardon the pun."}
{"text":"Haven't tried their \"round\" pizzas, but their deep dish square pizzas are great. Large deep dish has 10 slices. Crust is tasty and not tough. And delivery is always much quicker than competition. Good customer service too-- I placed a catering order for a children's birthday party and not only did they call me to let me know they were running a few minutes behind (heavy rain that day), but they also threw in an extra pizza free of charge. Only reason for 4 vs. 5 stars is because generally I'm a thin crust/NY style fan. Turkey sandwich on focaccia pretty good too!"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza around!  My favorite is Aloha BBQ chicken, but all of it is delicious.  Jet's bread = best breadsticks I have ever had and I have had a lot of breadsticks. The owner is a super cool guy who cares about quality and customer service. Try it out. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get some pizza when I'm in Chandler. Reminds me of Pal Joey's Pizza from West Chicago, IL. Great crust and sauce and their sausage is outstanding. A must for you Pizza Lovers."}
{"text":"I actually found out about Jet's when I was commiserating with some guys while we were all waiting (and waiting.. and waiting) for our pizza from another restaurant. 

I had never heard of it before (I don't live in the area) so I decided to give it a shot. We had a hand-tossed pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms, and it was great. If any complaint, the sauce was a tiny bit bland, but I'm not a huge fan of heavy tomato sauces so that's almost a plus in my book (my husband was the one who views it negatively). 

The pizza was also ready quickly and it came out HOT. I know where I'm going next time I want takeaway pizza in this area ."}
{"text":"This place now is one of my favorite. 
I order Jets from Mathew twice a month because it's super delicious  

EA"}
{"text":"Gave them another shot. This is now the only place we order from. Best pizza in Parma!"}
{"text":"My husband is obsessed with deep dish pizza. I'm not, but he can't get enough of Jet's. Their regular pizzas are all right, but hubby raves about the deep dish and the crispy burnt cheese crust (which is actually awesome). The deep dish is super bready  and pillowy, so if that's your thing, you'll love it here."}
{"text":"Ha Ha, sorry my friend said something funny. This place is called Jets pizza (don't ask me why) I had an average experience here: they took over an hour to get us the pizza us the pizza  (emphasis), BUT they gave us an another large pizza. So if you like pizza, they made up for it (that is, if you're asking me). Not everyone is italian (in the world) so if you're not then maybe this place isn't for you. thanks for reading, i did enjoy the pizza (which is what i was trying to say). YELP!"}
{"text":"Here are my now 3 most favorite pizza places near me:  Sal's Gilbert Pizza is number 1.  Jet's Pizza is number 2.  And, Buddyz Pizza is number 3.  Are are great in their own way.  1 and 3 serve delicious ice cold frothy beer in frosty cold glasses.  Mmmmm.  Beer and Pizza proves there truly is a Supreme Being.  Jet's has great pizza, but no beer.  Anyway, Jet's is a great choice but it is takeout only.  Prices are really good, too.  Jet's should open a location at ASU and become instant Bizzionaires."}
{"text":"Jets is the best! Great delivery, great order takers, 100% accurate. Very cordial guy on the phone. Delivery person great attitude and manners. A+"}
{"text":"Waiting 1/2 hour and still going to be another 10 minutes for our pizzas, highly uncharacteristic for this location.    Love the pizzas, BUT if it happens again we'll be looking for a new favorite pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Jet's is easily the best take out pizza I have ever had. The ingredients are always fresh and I love their crust, which is a big deal because I usually do not eat the crust when I get pizza from most places. They even have crust flavors...do yourself a favor and get the turbo crust! Whenever I get a pizza craving I will definitely order from them again and again."}
{"text":"When I first saw Jets Pizza taking over the old Bruster's, I thought, \"ugh, ANOTHER pizza place.\" It took years for me to finally give it a try and I will say, the pizza is pretty awesome. I've never tried their round pizzas but the square/rectangular ones are great. Now, this isn't your authentic pizza or anything. It's more like thick, extremely buttery, bread topped with thick sweet sauce, loaded with a thick layer of cheese and pepperoni if you so choose. So basically, it's thick on everything. On top of that, you can \"flavorize\" your crust by adding even more cheese/spices. However, I will say they skimp a little on the pepperoni. What I like so much about their pizza is the bottom and outer edges are perfectly crispy while the center is perfectly soft, as bread usually is. It's such a nice contrast in texture for every bite. A thing to note is that it's mostly a takeout place so don't plan on eating here. 

Although I still can't say Jet's is my favorite pizza chain, Jets definitely hits the spot when you're craving \"fake,\" all around terrible for you, pizza."}
{"text":"Really?!?!  It all tastes unhealthy and blah.  I've been here twice and have been so underwhelmed!!   Their toppings are pretty small, the sauce is weak and if you like thin crust you're better off making a pizza on pita bread and baking it.  Much better off going somewhere that takes a little more pride in their pizza."}
{"text":"On Superbowl Sunday, we called to order Jet's pizza at noon, for a 6:00 pm pickup. They said it was not too early to order. When my husband arrived at 6:00 pm, they rang up his order and he paid with a tip. THEN, he waited and waited until after the kickoff!! Jet's knew that they had forgotten the order, and instead of telling my husband this, they had him pay and then sit for 40 minutes waiting (and he wasn't the only mad person who was waiting). At 6:40 pm, we were FINALLY able to take the pizza to a party. Most people had eaten and weren't very hungry for our pizza anymore. I still gave it 3 stars because the pizza tastes good. However, I plan to look up online pizza reviews and try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Jet's pizza is my guilty pleasure. I'm usually a local pizza joint guy, but I make an exception for this chain.  They're known for their \"Detroit\" style deep dish, which is essentially a Sicilian pie. The crust is so buttery, crunchy and delicious.  Make sure to order the 8 corner though instead of the regular deep dish. The 8 corner is actually 2 small pizzas (equals a large), but you get 8 corner pieces. Get it?!  The corner pieces have the biggest crust, which is the best part of the pizza (that's not usually the case!).  It also makes ordering easier when I want meat and my wife doesn't.  The salads are no joke either. We always order the Greek to share, which helps justify the meal!

Jet's usually has a living social deal going too, so check that out before ordering!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Square deepdish, not Chicago style but different and good. Service was really bad. They were nice, but it took an hour when it was supposed to take 15 min. The first time we went in they couldn't find our online order, then they said come back in 15min, we did, and then they said come back in 10 min. Frustrating, but maybe a fluke, we'll try again because we like the pizza so much. $14."}
{"text":"6:20 pm: Ordered two ridiculously simple pizzas (1 small deep dish pepperoni, 1 small thin crust cheese) online, the confirmation code said we could expect it delivered by 7:11. 
At 7:45, we called the store and were told the delivery driver was on his way with our order. 
8:05, we called back. Snarky phone guy asked us if we were sure we actually ordered online, then if we were sure we ordered from the Montford location, before retaking our order and telling us that we had to present our confirmation code at the door before getting our pizzas that we'd have to wait ANOTHER 45 minutes for... although our order was supposedly already prepared and out for delivery. We finally got our food around 9:30 pm.

I don't understand what took so long for such a simple order on a Sunday, or why we were met with such suspicion over our order. Did someone at Jet's get a little hungry and hope we wouldn't notice when dinner never came?
These questions may never be answered, but one thing is for sure: if there's anything I love more than being hungry, it's having to jump through hoops for the food I've already been charged for! Thanks, Jet's!"}
{"text":"Ok it just get worse and worse!!! Charlotte simply just does not have good pizza  Ive tried alot of different places and the pizza is either BAD or just ok. Jets falls in the category of just ok reminded me of a step above little caesars..But i would prefer lil caesars at least its cheap. I wont be eating here again,  Might as well just go to Dominos or wolfman"}
{"text":"I love jets pizza my first time ordering from jets was on my lunch break at work I ordered the small deep dish and it was a lot for your money it took me two days to eat the pizza considering I work night shift I also got the sweet chili traditional wings they were a lil undercooked but great flavor but every time I order the wings now I tell them to cook it well done and it is everything lol. Jets is now my favorite pizza spot I'm waiting on them to deliver my food now as I speak"}
{"text":"Missed the pizza driver & when I called to see if there was anything I could do about my order they told me I could pick it up at the store, where the made me a fresh one & applied a discount code as well!! Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Finally a pizza joint with excellent Sicilian Pizza (square)  pizza or as Jets calls it \"Deep Dish\". I usually request the bottom be cooked well done as I find their deep dish can sometimes be soggy in the middle. I was not a fan of the NY style pizza or their salads but they still get 5 stars because the deep dish makes up for it all. 

You can pick up or have your order delivered and the staff always seems to find me a coupon that they can apply to my current order. How awesome is that? Jets you keep this type of service up and I may just have to dine with you more than once a week :)"}
{"text":"This is awesome, traditional, greasy pizza. It's so bad (for you) it's good. Jet's is known for it's deep dish style pizzas (small or large size ... medium is a regular round pizza) so make sure you order it that way. I had cheese, cheese & pepperoni, and  Hawaiian from here ... and honestly I think the plain cheese & pepperoni is the best. This is one of the places that simple is the best way to go, all specialty pizzas do is just complicate it and take away from the good & greasy heritage. 

Salads are good -- fair amount of toppings and true to size. We ordered a small chef and it was plenty enough for a size salad for 4 people to go with our pizzas. 

Cheesy bread was good ... nothing to write home about, however. Might try and get a different kind of bread next time, as they have a few to pick from."}
{"text":"Jets is the reason I've gained 20lbs... It's absolutely delish! I'm originally from Michigan, and this is authentic Detroit style pizza. What is Detroit style? It's simple really, it's all about the deep dish crust....crispy, garlicky (that just happened), baked cheesy, amazing!!! There are several locations of Jets, all are great, the one on Montford is my fav only because it was the first Jets in Charlotte. If you like pizza, I highly recommend Jets!"}
{"text":"Former Michigander living in Southern California. Was out visiting friends in the Valley and came to this location. Spot on from the pizza to the Jet Bread. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Pros: good pizza and bread sticks. Tastes different than your typical chain pizza spot.

Cons: driver delivered pizza ($30 for $23.50, $3.50 tip automatically included in the bill), and tried to walk away without giving change. My sister asked for her money and the driver asked if she wanted two or three dollars back. This is a classic case of bullying people out of their money (out of the 6.50 owed). Has to stop. She says this isn't the first time someone there has tried this with her.

With that being said, pick up your pizza. Do not get delivery."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and have never had Jets until now. This is the only Jets location I have ever ordered from, but the service has been outstanding every time (4 out of 4 times). Delivery is fast and food is always fresh. The turbo crust is a must and the deep dish is phenomenal. Prices are reasonable and they always have a coupon available. Cinnasticks are great too. Hands down the best pizza delivery place in the area."}
{"text":"Yes I love Jets in general. This location is no exception. Story: One of the delivery guys couldn't find my house and called me a bunch of times and i didn't hear it so I didn't pick up. Naturally I looked at my phone after it had been a long time. I called and told them it was my fault but asked if they could bring back the pizza. They brought me the old cold one and also a brand new one. They have excellent customer service and deliver fast and easy! I would recommend this Jets location!"}
{"text":"Decent Pizza but nothing to rave about.  Chandler location is grossly overpriced.  They do not have specials and refuse to offer discounts regardless of quantity ordered."}
{"text":"Jets is good pizza. Always fresh and the pizza is enough so that a couple can enjoy the next day for leftoves. Turbo crust is delicious. Great take out option."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza; however, if you do not have a coupon be prepared for a larger pizza bill that you would normal get a gourmet pizza restaurant, not a fast food pizza joint."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service.   Classic pizza... nothing special but nothing wrong either.   I didn't see any beer/wine service."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza, I wish I had one closer to my house. I'd visit this place a lot if there was. Great deep dish crusty pizza with great flavor."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. However, their delivery service leaves much to be desired. It's atrocious. Expect an hour wait for delivery even if they tell you it will be 45 minutes. They need to hire more drivers maybe?"}
{"text":"I walked into this place and thought \"ooh, it smells like Chuck E. Cheese in here.\" My husband agreed. We were off to a good start.

We ordered a medium pizza to go. It was the round kind, not the square kind they're apparently known for, and we didn't try the thin crust this time around. I thought the pizza was fine, if a little mediocre -- mushrooms tasted canned (not fresh), cheese was rubbery, crust wasn't spectacular -- but more likely than not I'll be back soonish because I like giving my business to local pizza places instead of the big chains. And I like pizza so I eat it a lot.

One weird thing: at about 7:30 on a weekday they seemed to be shutting down the dining area. Their hours say they're open much later than that, so I don't know what was up."}
{"text":"I tried Jets on Christmas Eve due to the recommendation from my brother.  It was delivered hit and fresh.  We got the 8 corner with Pepperoni and sausage.  It was outstanding.  I normally prefer a NY style pizza, but this pan pizza was fantastic.  We had leftovers, heated it up the next day and tasted almost as good as fresh.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Manager I have been ordering jets pizza delivery for a year but when I call today to order a pizza the manager said they don't deluv
Delivery on old Steele creek anymore I think this terrible they must have a new manager this is terrible"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza!!! My husband turned me on to this as he is from Michigan and that's is where Jets pizza originated. Had it 3 times now and it has always been hot, fresh and delicious. It's a thick crust square pizza."}
{"text":"Apparently, we're hooked!

I'm not sure what took so long for us to try Jet's. We found another pizzeria not far from where we lived that served up the slices like we are used to back home in New Jersey so we just stayed with them.

But one day I guess I didn't feel like driving to the other pizzeria and Jet's is next door and they deliver. So we decided to try it. First of all, the fact that it's next door meant that when it arrived, it was still piping HOT! Then the aroma from the pizza was just EVERYTHING! We order the deep dish with the turbo crust. Honestly, if you order it any other way, you should be slapped...you've been warned. 

THAT TURBO CRUST IS JUST SO YUMMYLICIOUS!

We have alway done Pizza Friday's in our home. And there are weeks when I don't want to spend money on anything. But my son always put in his bid for Jet's pizza. He even passed on a burger from a well known burger joint because he wanted to save money and room for Jet's."}
{"text":"I'm really loving Jet's pizza right now. The best part? They have slices all the time, which for a singleton like me is perfect! You can get two large squares of their deep dish one topping pizza and a 20 oz soda for $5 bucks even - what a deal! The pizza is very filling and I love the deep dish. Nice flavor to the sauce as it's not overpowering.

I'm thrilled to have a new pizza place in town that offers slices and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Just got a 8 cut deep dish pizza! This pizza is nasty! Very heavy and greasy. We threw 4 slices away."}
{"text":"The ubiquitous pizza parlor in any given city under the sun doesn't have to shove into the long line of familiar menus, toppings and standard pizza accoutrement when you have the right variety. I am very pleased to say that Jet's does an exceptional job and makes for a great experience to be had. 

Met a friend here for lunch and was excited to see their quick service set up for dine-in lunchers. Very clean spot with ample seating, a generously sized soda/silverware station and huge windows for plenty of natural lighting. The interior is very clean and simple. Just the way any quick service joint should be!

The pizza was fantastic. I'm not one for going with \"old reliable,\" but pepperoni was a great choice. The aspects that really make their pie choices are the different crusts. Deep dish with \"turbo\" crust comes highly recommended. Cool thing about it is that you don't have to pay any extra for special types of crust! The deep dish is so crispy on the bottom and entire exterior, the cheese is perfectly melted and even pooled together around the crust and the pepperoni was slightly crispy and flavorful. Each bite was a well-balanced mix of textures and flavor. The two of us killed a large no problem! 

Family friendly and I mean...come on. Pizza is always good when you can get it to go! Excited to come back to Jet's and sample some of their other crusts and topping options. Great job!"}
{"text":"We have ordered several pizza's from here. All good, consistent quality. The deep dish are great."}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona from Metro New York 3 years ago. Missed having my New York Sicilian Pizza. Could not find anything like it here. Tried a number of places but to no avail. Jet's Pizza opened up within walking distance to my home. Thought I would give it a try. Turned out to be the best deep dish pizza (which is what New York Sicilian pizza is known as here). Great crust, tasty sauce. Great wings as well. I like plain wings with ranch dressing on the side. The staff was more than accommodating. Wings were crispy outside, tender and moist inside. It just does not get any better."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. First off, i am from NY, so i prefer thin crust, although i have been to chicago many times and enjoy the thick crust once in a while. Next time i get the craving, i am headed to Chicago because this pizza pretty much sucked. I was completely unimpressed by their overly-greasy crust. I will admit though it is a step up from Fuel... Which isn't saying much. If you like quality pizza, please don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Well gave them another shot. Actually made my Pizza as requested this time. Could have used alittle more garlic butter but all in all other was a good pizza. Steak sandwich was very good as well as the garlic bread. Currently will be my go to spot for pizza until I find the right one."}
{"text":"If you're sick of the Papa Johns and Dominos like I am than you'll love Jet's Pizza. Jet's makes their dough in house and uses fresh ingredients which makes their pizza stand far above the other chains in the area. Their deep dish is the best in the valley and their customer service is excellent for a little take-out/delivery place. Absolutely give Jet's a try if you can!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good - pepperoni and veggie. Sauce was delicious, thin crust was fabulous, and there were ample veggies. I think the only thing I would suggest is more pepperoni - as it seemed like they skimped a bit on ours. Pizza was still very good. I am a fan. There are many pizza shops on Mayfield and I suggest giving this one a try!

Based on the other reviews - we picked up and that might have been a really good choice."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Detroit style 8 corners pizza!  This town needed this!  I come here all the time and they deliver! My kids love the Bread for dipping!  And a great salad! Owners from Michigan, very nice people! If anyone had a bad experience, it was an isolated incident I believe.  We come here all the time and just have such a wonderful meal! And tv's to watch so you don't miss the news or a game!"}
{"text":"Yes I know this is a review of a pizza chain but I need to write this review due to the level of professionalism that was given to me tonight.

After a long drive from Detroit, MI the family and I decided to stop for a quick pizza. This location was down the street from our location so we ordered two pizzas and a salad. Kayla, who greeted me upon arrival, quickly grabbed my order and I was out the door. Not to mention I asked for plates, napkins, forks and crushed red pepper. After checking my bags at the car, we had been missing a side of ranch. I quickly returned inside and Kelly was kind enough to not only give us one side of ranch but two! 

Kelly, you did an exquisite job on taking care of me and you're the reason why I gave the review that I did."}
{"text":"As much as I love Jet's Pizza, this location is the worst.  On a Sunday during football games, their website says they're open until 11pm.  Well, it does until you try to order anyway, then it claims they're closed.  Trying to call their number is met with a constant busy signal.  Now, I know what you're thinking.  Maybe they're having website trouble right?  I'd agree if this were a one time thing, but this happens all the time.

Things get even worse if you actually do manage to get through to them and anything goes wrong.  They have the rudest staff of any pizza place I've worked with.  Argumentative, snippy, and sarcastic are a few of the most apt descriptors for them.  Not to mention they will flat out lie to you and say that you're not in their delivery area if they don't feel like making your pizza.  I'm less than 5 miles from them in a very safe part of the city and got this line, after they'd already delivered to me twice before.

I've given them a couple of tries because I do love Jet's Pizza.  But it doesn't matter how good the product is if the customer service sucks.  I think I'll make the drive to the Matthews location if I get the craving for them again."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. I wish that little man would take me on a ride :)

Seedable-"}
{"text":"This is a little takeout pizza joint in the same shopping center as Kuhn's. 

We all got their 2 slice and a drink special for $5. Good deal and it was tasty. The crust was buttery and crunchy but soft and fluffy at the center. I like sweet sauce and this place did it well. Is it the best? No...but it's worth the stop and some revisits. They also deliver which is another plus. 

Here's where it gets good though...

The service was AMAZING! Once the gentleman at the counter found out it was our first visit there, he took his time to explain their menu. Very engaging and I could tell he was really proud of their food.  He even said if we wanted our pizza cooked lighter to let him know and he'd redo the order with a less crunchy crust. It was perfect though and everyone ordering with me enjoyed it. Please support this place. There's not a ton of places that offer excellent customer service these days. When great service is combined with a great product, it's a win in my book."}
{"text":"Their deep dish pizza is to die for! Honestly! THE BEST! The crust is light yet buttery and crisp So good! I also enjoy their sauce and the use a good quality cheese. Me and my boyfriend are hooked! It's our new go to pizza place! They are very pleasant to speak with when we order..  I've never tried anything other than the deep dish because I love it so much... I really hope people support this business and it remains open... I'm pretty sure it's the only jets pizza in Pittsburgh! 5 stars all the way, for great food and a pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"They just opened the Jet's near my home and we've been waiting to try it out. The guys working there are all so friendly. The pizza was very good! We got the deep dish and Jet's bread. Both sooooo good. I'm not a big deep dish fan, but this is definitely worth trying. We will have it again soon I'm sure! We did have a little mix up with a coupon, but the manager was quick to fix it. Again, really great people working there and great customer service."}
{"text":"This may sound odd to some of you, but this is perhaps my favorite pizza in all of C-U. I know, I know, there are a lot of different options, but there's something particularly great about Jet's.
I think the crust is what does it for me. The thick crust with the blend of cheese and garlic is as original as it is delicious.
Been here multiple times for a slice or two, as well as a whole pizza and have never been disappointed. Delivery is always a great option too. I like that they stick to their deliver window so you're not left wondering where your pizza is.
Bottom line: great pizza at a bargain price. Love it."}
{"text":"Hard to believe I could give 5 stars to a takeout pizza place but this was so outstanding that the rating is deserved.  Glad to have found it.  I confess, I believe pizza should be round not square but this square pizza was outstanding.  We had the barbecue chicken pizza with extra sauce.  Picked it up and even when we got it home it was still hot and very fresh.  Try it and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"Probably the most perfect deep dish pizza you'll ever find! Everything on the menu is good. However if you're not from Michigan, or are otherwise new to this, start with a simple deep dish with pepperoni and mushrooms and an antipasto. You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and onions and an order of jets bread for dinner today. And that will be the last time. This place used to have the best pizza around. It was crispy and the portions were good and it came hot. The last few times we've ordered it the pizza has just been terrible and today was the last time I'm gonna waste my money. I couldn't eat more that one piece. I had the pizza on my lap while my friend drove home and it was burning my legs so I assumed the pizza was really hot, but when we got home the top of the pizza was cold and I don't live far away. There was way too much cheese. That's all you could taste and most of it wasn't even melted. There were onions on three pieces of the pizza and I could count each burnt piece of onion on one hand. Complete disappointment.  If I order onions on a pizza I want some on each piece and enough that I can taste it and I'd prefer them not to be burnt black. I don't get how they let food like that out the door. The jets bread was pretty good, but not good enough to make me come here again. My advice is take $6 and go to Georgio's or little Caesars and buy one of their ready made pizzas. It's a shame that I can get better tasting and quality pizza that is a third of the price and sits in a hot box all day than I got here after paying over $20 and it was made \"fresh\"."}
{"text":"Classic greasy delicious pizza. :) Just what the doctor ordered. Nothing to write home about; nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Pizza is fine. Delivery people are not very personable, and I'd say border on rude. It's not acceptable to ignore a customer when they greet you, nor is it okay to toss receipts on top of the box and shove them at the customer as they are trying to be friendly. A sarcastic \"thanks for the tip\" doesn't help either.

I'm not an unreasonable person. I work in customer relations. I understand there are scenarios where jumping through hoops isn't required, so I don't expect that.  I do expect common decency from any service provider. Absolutely no reason for me to pay premium prices to be treated like trash.

If I wanted that, I'd stick with the local Pizza Hut or something."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the talk and rave was about this pizza . So i went in today and tried a pizza , and a order of the wings . and OMG this pizza rocks! the wings are perfectly seasoned and super mouth watering . The staff was soo friendly , and i am now a lifetime customer !! thanks yelp , and thanks jets"}
{"text":"Ok. Let me start by saying this is the worst pizza, if you call it that, i have ever had. We saw a jets pizza delivery across the street and decided to try it. Ordered a cheese  pizza a build your own and mild boneless wings. Total with delivery,  56.23. Very expensive Cardboard.

The build your own was ordered without cheese. It came with cheese. I called and the girl said, \" well we assumed  that you made a mistake  and wanted cheese. WHAT?  IT WAS ON ONLINE ORDER.   Got a refund on that pizza. The cheese pizza was worse then frozen pizza
Cant even eat this. Look at the pics. Does this look like a pizza?  Amd its cut into 24 slices. This does not resemble  the pics on their web site. Awful. Wont EVER make this mistake again."}
{"text":"A welcome change of pace compared to the usual suspects. The deep dish pizza is good, and made with all fresh toppings. 

I really liked the sauce. A bit on the spicy side with a great tomato kick.  The sausage really stands out, and is used in a bit of a larger chunk that doesn't leave you wondering if you got any on your slice.

Try the flavored crusts.  The cajun crust is my favorite."}
{"text":"This new to Cleveland pizza chain has really won me over.  Their 8 corner pizza - now being copied by Little Ceaser's - is awesome.  Every slice is the corner slice, and that's where it's at for me.  The sauce is really good, and when you get the cajun flavored crust you get just the right amount of heat to the pizza.

Quality is always spot on, and from what I understand they have very strict quality controls in place to assure you get a great pizza every time you order.

The locations few and far between, but I really hope that changes so that more Clevelanders get to enjoy this mouth watering pie."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza tasted great... perfect temperature right amount of grease pepperoni was perfect cheese tasted perfect cant say enough thank you for the tasty pizza"}
{"text":"awful pizza and the service was awful. did not allow us to use a coupon that was not even expired yet. delivery guy was rude. never will be returning."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner. Jet's is relatively new and we didn't know what to expect, to be honest. However, the pizza is much better than we had expected. They are cheap and fast but actually have quality ingredients and great tasting food. Most places that are cheap and fast, let their taste suffer. Our favorites are the New York style pepperoni, jet's bread and the antipasto salad"}
{"text":"Always delicious pizza. Better quality than papa johns or dominos pizza hands down. The deep dish pan pizza is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"The 8 corner deep dish is unlike what you will get anywhere else. I loved this place in Middleburg hts. And am very happy to have a location close to me again!"}
{"text":"Love Jet's Pizza!  We've ordered pizza from Jet's a number of times and we've never been disappointed.  This last time we ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza, square pepperoni pizza and cheesy bread.  Plenty of food for four people with some leftovers.  The employees are friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the food is great -- what more could you want!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and boneless chicken wings
Called in order it was ready when I got there and was nice and hot"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Jets. If I can't request something for you to try, it has to be the buffalo chicken pizza. Anytime we wander away from Jets pizza we regret it. They have the best pizza in the area. There are so many options and we have never been disappointed. I have one complaint, they mess up your order at least 40% of the time. I still give them 5 stars because they go above and beyond to correct the order on the spot. There are always coupons available but if you don't have one on hand they will always share the specials over the phone."}
{"text":"I am only giving 1 star because I can't give 0. Not much to say except way overpriced for the nasty conveyer belt pizza they peddle. I would rather eat Little Caesars and that is about all I will say. With all the other family owned pizza joints in this area, there is no reason to order this for the price."}
{"text":"Love the deep dish pizza !!  This is not fast food pizza
Not your typical franchise pizza trust me

Salad is generous with fresh vegetables , had to take home"}
{"text":"Let's put it this way after having the pizza yesterday about an hour later we were in the bathroom for about half an hour and this is the second or third time that has happened... taking a break from this place for sure"}
{"text":"Noticed this new pizza place on a trip to Home Depot, so decided to try it for delivery one night instead of our usual two candidates. Wow really good. We got a pepperoni  pizza, and also a pineapple\ham pizza - I had the later and really enjoyed it. Their Triple cheese Turbo bread sticks were the best. Now this will be our go-to place for pizza, anytime we are not looking to also pick up spaghetti (since they don't have pasta on the menu)."}
{"text":"Closest thing to my aunts homemade pizza I've ever had ! Really really really good pizza - once you try it you'll wonder why you didn't know about it ! Consider yourself informed ! Other pizza ? No way ! 
Jets is the best !!!!"}
{"text":"With all the pizza competition out there you would think that any new kid on the block would do something to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.....not so with Jet's.  There is nothing special about this pizza, the super special was just a bunch of toppings with really no flavor(like a cheap frozen pizza).  The boneless wings were frozen like as well.  Don't waste your money here....."}
{"text":"I discovered Jet's Pizza when they opened a place in the Denver area, when I was living there. I lived in Detroit for about 16 months, years and years ago, and ever since have yearned for authentic Detroit Pizza. Jet's fills the bill, and then some. Ohhhh, so great! I was thrilled to find that Jet's is here in Phoenix, so when I want to really treat myself, I will order one. Advice: ALWAYS get the 8-corner pizza with Turbo crust. I promise you won't be sorry. The corners are the best, even if you're not really a \"pizza-bones\" fan. It's unbelievable with a baked-on combo of parmesan, romano, and garlic butter and it makes the entire experience worthwhile. I keep hoping they will open a third PHX location a tiny bit closer, but in the meantime it is SO worth the trip to Tatum/Shea. Driving home will make you wish you put it in the trunk because it smells so wonderful!"}
{"text":"My boyfriends been telling me about Jets pizza for a while now finally I get to try them. 
He ordered the deep dish pepperoni and jets bread.
The flavors is decent but both the pizza and the jets bread are too doughy for me
And I'm a papa johns cheese sticks (garlic butter) girl , so I'm not so impressed with the jets bread,sorry! 
We will probably order Jets again but will skip the bread."}
{"text":"Love the turbo crust square pizza! I stop by for slices at inch sometimes and they are always so pleasant. Plus, one of maybe 3 places that deliver to my house."}
{"text":"I tried this pizza for the first time. It was very good cheesy yummyness, but I will say there wings need a lot of work very soggy I think they were run through the pizza oven!! Terrible.. The sauce was good though..If in the neighborhood again I'll go back."}
{"text":"I LOVE Jets pizza.

I have Jets as a contact in my phone, I'm almost surprised I don't know everyone that works there at this point.  

Jets is a deep-dish, greasy, buttery amazing pizza - the kind where the corners are the best part.  I've tried a few of their different pizzas, from round not deep dish, to regular deep dish, to the eight corner deep dish.  I've settled on the eight corner deep dish with pepperoni with the Turbo crust as the best one.  Turbo crust equals butter, garlic and romano.

Give Jets a try if you're looking for a deep-dish style pizza, but make sure you save me a corner slice."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best pizza store in Matthews. I usually get pepperoni pizza or a veggie pizza deep dish. Very good. I don't think that you would be disappointed if you order from here."}
{"text":"Realizing that pizza is such a personal taste,if you,like me are a deep dish officianado I would urge you to try Jet's Pizza! Their crust is outstanding, as are toppings,sauce slightly tangy for me which is why I didn't go 5 stars,but this is seriously good pizza! Give it a try"}
{"text":"Jets is one of my favorite pizza chains. But something is wrong with this location.  They are zero for three on getting my order right. It's either late, setting ingredients, or both. I've given up on coming here. They always get it wrong!  Then you have to wait for them to remake it. Not worth the hassle. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was great to eat at a jets pizza again, as we loved them back from Michigan. Great same taste of the
Pizza and salad we remembered. Owner was very nice and also from Michigan. Hope to see more stores out here in Az."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  When I rolled in, unknowingly 5 minutes before they closed, Jude cheerfully said 'absolutely, I'll make your pizza and you're going to love it!'.  Guess what? He was right! 

I ordered a deep dish pizza and it was so good! Crunch on the crust and ooey gooey cheesy on top - it was perfect!  He also turned me on to their cinnamon sticks which I loved!! Tasted like an awesome Cinnabon in a stick form - so good!!  

I will definitely be back especially because Jude was so great and instead of making me feel bad for coming in just as they were closing, he made me laugh and just had a super great attitude.  

Oh - if you like ranch - get it here - you'll want to drink it up - so dippingly good!! 

Thanks Jet's for the great food and thanks Jude for the even better service!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars! Jets Pizza in Dormont has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I have tried ordering pizza from here 2 times. Both of these times ended in me having to cancel my order and demand a refund"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but unfortunately the delivery driver was the most unprofessional and rude person I have ever met. Never again."}
{"text":"Michigan's best pizza! I grew up on Jets. I'm so happy this is here in AZ. As soon as I walk in the place I feel like I am home!"}
{"text":"I grew up with Jet's in the midwest and it's always been my favorite pizza chain. The sweet sauce, abundant cheese and thick crust is the best! I wanted to write a review because I also experienced great customer service today at Jet's. They gave us the wrong pizza for takeout, and we didn't realize it until we got home. When I called, they offered to deliver us the correct pizza, even though we live a few miles outside the delivery zone. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and their service made my night!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but a move is not complete without pizza delivered. Recently I moved and just didn't have the energy to make anything to eat or go anywhere. I remembered getting Jet's Pizza coupons in the mail and decided to give them a try.

They do a fast delivery! I got a basic special: pizza, breadsticks, and wings. It was all so good...greasy like crazy, but delicious! 

They have a great price point, deliver, and make my taste buds happy, what more can I say?"}
{"text":"Jets pizza is now in Arizona!!!! Jets pizza is a Midwest pizza franchise that I love!!! They have over 400 locations, and 2 in Arizona now !!! Thanks to yelp I found them . The service at this location is awesome ! The pizza makes me feel like Im back in Michagan 20 years ago . I will never eat any other pizza in Arizona, if you are a pizza lover , this is a must have ! You will be hooked !"}
{"text":"I love Jets pizza. By far my favorite. Gets the turbo crust on an 8 corner pizza, it's amazing Also, their boneless wings are great. Nice big size chunks and good sauce. This location was quick and everything was great."}
{"text":"I went to purchase a pizza from Jets's tonight, and was treated very rudely by this tall skinny White kid who decided to put on a show in front of other customers because I previously complained about a poorly made pizza. So out of retaliation from a previous visit, he decided not to grant my educator's discount of 20%. He said it was 10% and refused to correct it. Then he rudely told me that I could leave his store because I told him about his rude behavior. He cancelled my order against my request. He needs some customer service training. He claims to be a manager. He wouldn't manage any of my stores. I will be placing a call to the Corporate location in Michigan. He also made reference to the Parma location. Not sure about his insinuation. He is in need of further training."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience from jets!  Being from Michigan, I'm sure the majority of my weight problem is from being in love with jets !"}
{"text":"This isn't the world's greatest pizza but it's what Pizza Hut's pizza used to taste like (back in the 80s) before they started being bad.   It's greasy, buttery, crunchy and tasty!  I know that doesn't say much for those who never knew what good Pizza Hut used to taste like but it was very nostalgic to me.   Theyhave hand-tossed, sicilian pan (this is what i had) and deep.  They have a lunch special of two slices and a drink for $5.   They have either pepperoni, sausageor cheese....and unfortunately they won't add any extra toppings to it....grrr.....    There's only one bench in there,  so there's no dining in... Another grrr.....  It wouldn't be my first choice for lunch in that area, but 's a decent alternative if you're craving for a quick, greasy lunch."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Would have given it a 5 but ordered wings from here and found them to be a little disappointing. Definitely a new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza delivered here while visiting Madison for our nephew's graduation.  I am a fan of Detroit style pizza and was pleasantly surprised.  Sadly, I have generally been disappointed by dining and takeout in Madison, so I was pleased to have at least one decent meal during this visit.  The crust is excellent, crusty and crunch, and the cheese bakes in for a wonderful effect unique to Detroit pizza."}
{"text":"I really like this place. 

I recommend the deep dish square pizza. The crust is thick and chewy. (No, it is not Chicago-style.). Their sauce is great, not overly sweet, and works well with the cheese and toppings.  They do a nice job with the cheese amount (which is quite a bit), and the whole mix just works. 

Their round pizza is less distinctive but is still very good. The crust is not floppy, but almost still without being crispy. Again, I love their sauce. The rest is pretty standard but well balanced in the portions. 

I also like this Jets because they have helped our high school band several times. They are supportive of our very large orders and when they deliver all the pizzas, they make sure we have everything we need before they leave. Thank you, Jets."}
{"text":"Relative to similar types of quick to-go or delivery pizza places, Jet's is far superior in value, service, consistency, quality and overall product. Remember, this is not high end pizza place, but it is really good. We particularly enjoy the slices when we want a quick meal on the run. The owners and employees here are quite nice and eager to make their customers happy. We're glad to have Jet's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Finally excellent pizza in Arizona!  Try their deep dish BBQ chicken pizza and you will think you went to heaven!  

The only problem I had was finding this location, it is on the NE corner of Tatum and Shea, behind the Walgreens."}
{"text":"We loved our Knoxville TN Jet's and missed it when we moved. Not any more!! They have a deep dish with cruchy edges that is soooooo good! We got it half/half Supreme & Hawaiian, just like we remembered. Yum! We also liked the Cinnastix, saved those for breakfast with coffee. Again, YUM!! If you haven't tried Jet's but were considering it, I vote do it"}
{"text":"Gotta get the 8 Corner Deep Dish. My favorite is tomato and mushroom. Tomatoes are actually diced, which I prefer over slices. Dipping with marinara is clutch. They offer a lot of crust flavors, but the standard is so good that I haven't bothered with the others!

I also really like the Boat. It's pretty much a calzone. Has a dusting of Parmesean on top and a buttery crust. There's more crust on the edge that's just dough than I would like, but it's not a deal breaker.

Delivery is quick. Today I ordered a cherry pepsi which they were out of, and they actually brought me a few replacement options rather than just not bringing the cherry. That was nice!

My favorite delivery place!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area and based on trip advisor and Yelp feedback,  we thought we give this a try.   Jetzees Steak and Cheese was delicious!  The bread put it over the top!  The cheese sticks could use more flavor but the cheese helping on them was perfect!  The deep dish pizza was a hit!  The pepperoni has a great deal of flavor to put this pizza in high marks!  Customer service was friendly."}
{"text":"Tried by the slice pizza. Very greasy and no Italian pizza flavor. Very bland. Gooey dough. No bathroom. Wanted water cup but they did not have ice. Will never go back. Worst pizza my husband and I ever ate."}
{"text":"Super-rude employees and manager Rob just cost Jets a customer that places 2-3 orders per week. All I did was call to ask why the online ordering system wasn't working and how long it would be down and  I was actually hung up on by (manager) Rob. When I called back to say we were disconnected, he said he thought we were done talking. I know you guys are busy, but this type of service is absolutely unacceptable. So rather than place an order and have your employees potentially do something to your pizza we chose to order from Papa Johns. 

So rude."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at the location, but we had some pizzas delivered for my daughter's birthday party. Everyone loved the pizza!  The deep dish was awesome and we also had the New York style. We had leftovers and the pizza was good cold or heated back up in the oven. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza. Usually very tasty and cooked as requested. They offer coupons online, if you sign up for their deals via email, and in your money mailer."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. Uptown arriving there were two employees outside the building smoking cigarettes. One of the employees saw me approach and quickly put her cigarette it by dragging it across the building. She then without washing her hands proceeded to get my pizza. The lack of hygiene disgusted me so much I threw the pizza in the trash. The place looked unkempt also appeared as though they lacked basic hygiene....stomach turning. Glad I saw that before unknowingly consumed this food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular hand tossed large pie. The pizza was like mush too much sauce, overly soft just a disaster.  What a waste of money should have went next door to the Chinese restaurant. Last time I get anything from Jets."}
{"text":"Tried to try Jets again....it wasn't a good idea. I placed an on line order and had the receipt from the order. I ordered a small, thin crust veggie pizza and a hoagie...they gave me a thick crust sausage pizza . I went back into the store and tried to tell someone about it but their employees conversations with each other are more important than the customer. After at least 3 minutes of excuse me's this rude girl came to the counter and said \"what.\" Not can I help you. I guess she was mad she had to work. I explained they got the order wrong..no apology...just this is what I show you ordered.i told her I had the receipt, gave her the food back and told her to refund my money. I get that every one makes mistakes but don't treat a customer wrong when you are clearly at fault. An apology goes a very long way. Here's a great suggestion Jets...teach your employees customer service. I won't be back and I can promise that I have and will continue to tell everyone I know of this experience."}
{"text":"Normally jets is my FAVORITE pizza. But this time way too much went wrong. 

1. I had a coupon I told them about, yet was charged the full price. 
2. I gave my entry code and apartment number and I had to go down and get it anyways. 
3. I ordered Cajun crust (The best part of the pizza) , which is on the receipt, but ZERO made it to the crust.
4. Sauce was different, way too onion(y)"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza... and I don't normally crave pizza. But I crave this! I personally like their deep dish, but my niece loves their classic pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place. Deep dish pizza reminds me of Pizza Huts when it first came out which was awesome.  Have ordered from there several times picked up and delivered and been happy each time. Pizza is cooked perfectly- crispy crust, beautiful melted cheese, toppings edge to edge.  Toppings have been great. Salads are fresh and the pizza bread  - garlic bread is really good.  They offer slices to go to. Tried the subs and deli boat which is like a calzone. Pretty good but I would go for the pizza and or salad combo.  My new place."}
{"text":"This pizza is great. I am usually a local pizza place person, Calas is great. I don't like the pizza hut, papa stuff....this Jets pizza is one of the best consistent pizza I've gotten in decades! The square deep dish can not be beat. We will eat Jets once a month its that good!"}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza here is absolutely phenomenal. Well worth trying this place over any of the other pizza joints in and around the Matthews area."}
{"text":"We ordered Jet's pizza again about two weeks ago.  I ordered an extra large deep dish meat pizza with extra cheese and extra banana peppers.  It was delicious!!

My husband took the leftovers to his brother and sister-in-law in Zanesville so that they could try it.  They told us that Jet's is the BEST pizza they have ever had.

There may be a need for a future Jet's in Zanesville!"}
{"text":"You can't always eat craft pizza and drink craft beer. For the everyday take-out or delivery, Let's Get Jets! I'm a huge fan of this place, a lot better than most of the chain places in the area I've been used to.

I had my first Jet's Pizza a couple of years ago at a work function and really like the deep dish style which is the norm for them, where at other places deep dish is extra or not offered at all. You get a nice, crispy, pan-style crust and an amazing sauce. I've found that sometimes it comes out slightly greasy but not too bad and no more than you should expect with a pan-style, it's borderline fried!

Keep in mind that this store is a take-out and delivery location only. Don't come here expecting to sit down and eat. People will probably stare at you if you un-box your pie on the 2-seater bench in the store!

Protip: If you don't feel like washing dishes after the meal, just ask for paper plates, utensils, napkins, and even Parmesan and red pepper packets. They'll supply it all for you on the delivery at no charge! 

Affordable, fast, and tasty! While I'm a hater when it comes to Michigan sports, they got some fine pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best! Deep dish pizzas in Charlotte! Better than the other major chains! The Philly Cheesesteak deep dish pizza is amazing as well! All employees at this location are awesome!"}
{"text":"I moved to AZ from Michigan over 10 years ago. And I missed my jets pizza dearly. Was so thrilled when they opened up shop out here near my home. I have introduced many a friend to the delicious pizza jets makes. The food tastes just as great as it did back in my home state....The BLT pizza is my absolute favorite and now I no longer have to settle for any old pizza when I'm craving one."}
{"text":"I never have any complaints about the location on Montford in Charlotte! From the person that takes the order, the time it takes to prepare, to delivery or pick up, they are always friendly and the price is right. I try different pizzas, but always get an antipasto with it. Pizza always has plenty of toppings and so do the salads."}
{"text":"Want something greasy, hot, delicious and bad for you (in a good way)--try Jets! This isn't the kind of pizza to order if you're watching your figure so just indulge! This pizza is greasy, but good! 

The first time I had it I went for the basic cheese and pepperoni pizza. Wow was it good! I usually don't just settle with a single topping pizza, but it was very tasty- And fresh! However, I recently ordered a custom pizza (mushrooms, onions, tomatoes and pepperoni) and it wasn't as good as the basic pizza. The pizza was made fresh and hot, but I didn't get the same orgasmic taste I got the first time ;-) and yes, I went there......

Next time I'll stick with the basics!"}
{"text":"We had this pizza delivered. Now I'm used to New York/New Haven Pizza. This is one of the best pizzas I've had in NC. 
I've only had the deep dish. I've tried the plain cheese, the meatball and onion and the pepperoni. All  were cooked very well. The cheese and tomato sauce were hot and not dried out. The crust had very good taste and had nice and crispy corners. 
I ordered through the website which was very easy.  It was dinner time on Sunday and I ordered ASAP. They indicated it could take up to 55 minutes, 24 minutes later we were eating hot pizza. 
I rarely order delivered pizza because they taste like cardboard and hate the pizza chains, but this was very good."}
{"text":"This town has terrible options for good Italian subs, but this place is a diamond in the rough.  The subs are a little non-traditional, they use pizza crust instead of traditional sub rolls, a spin on the Pittsburgh wedgie--they call theirs a Jetsie--and the results are glorious.  Do yourself s favor, if you want s goid Italian sub in Charlotte, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Like many others I am originally from Michigan. They continuously exceed my expectations. Their food is amazing whatever you order and their delivery is fast!! Five stars all the way around."}
{"text":"Jets is the best pizza outside of New York and Chicago. It's always hot when delivered and the delivery guy is always so pleasant. I like be it."}
{"text":"I usually really like Jet's, especially BBQ chicken-but I was a little disappointed about their quality this time. The pizza was overcooked on the side and too saucy. It completely lost its originally flavor... Breadstick was fine though."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Hawaiian is good and so is eugine supreme. I would definitely recommend going here. And the staff is great."}
{"text":"Last year my husband and I moved from the Toldeo, Ohio area to Madison. One of our biggest disappointments when we moved to Madison was losing our favorite pizza places. Luckily, we discovered that there is a Jet's Pizza location in Middleton. I have never had a less than perfect experience when eating Jet's Pizza. Last night, we ordered pizza to go from this Jet's location. We ordered an 8 corner with pepperonis and light sauce. Even with the 20 minute drive home, the pizza was still absolutely perfect when we ate it. I would absolutely recommend Jet's to anyone who has not tried it before and I would definitely tell you to get an 8 corner pizza.

Update: I just noticed that another reviewer mentioned that this location does not offer online ordering. I wanted to point out that this location DOES, in fact, offer online ordering. That is how I order when I get Jet's Pizza."}
{"text":"We're spoiled in this area with great fast food chains- the only thing missing \"Was\" Pizza.  Well, Jet's filled that gap big time!  Being from Michigan where Jet's originated, I had heard this pizza was awesome, so couldn't wait to try.  I have been there 3 times since it opened, and have enjoyed the very pleasant staff and the incredible deep dish pizza each time.  My favorite is the deep dish \"Jet's 10\"- a great combo, with savory crust that melts in your mouth.  The Wings are amazing too!  My only complaint is... that Jet's is so good, I have to limit myself to how often I can go there, but what a problem to have!  Go \"Get Some!\"..."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.   Excellent crust on deep dish.   Toppings are plentiful unlike most around.  

Decent menu and they actually have indoor seating with tv's.   They serve Pepsi, which I'm not a fan if, so Coke lovers you'll need to step down to the drink formerly called \"Brad's drink\" if you eat in.  

This is our go to pizza place at Exit 23 in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Really good pizza what else can I say. If you want deep dish pizza with a crisp buttery crust this is the place to go reminds me of what Pizza Hut used to have in their pan pizza accept this place does it even better"}
{"text":"Really good pizza for a chain, one caveat though-you have to order the square deep dish, the round is bobo, even for a chain. Decent wings. All in all a good experience outside of them being a bit pricey for a chain."}
{"text":"I've constantly been dissapointed with every single pizza place in Pittsburgh and I've lived in almost every neighborhood. It's sad that a chain can come to town and dominate the competition. The most flavorful pizza that doesn't leave you groggy. Crunchy crust, deep dish Chicago style with fresh toppings. Also, Jude, the manager on duty at the time was more than helpful to respond to any issue and informed us of their specials so that we could save a few bucks. Top notch all around."}
{"text":"I really hate it when I can't find a reason to dock a place at least one star. I mean, seriously, a five-star review for freakin' delivery pizza? Who the hell do I think I am? Well, for starters, I'm a guy that really takes his pizza seriously. In a world of bullshit sameness and average competition, it's pretty rare that a pizza joint even bothers to try anymore. They slap some government cheese and sugar-laden ketchup that supposed to be sauce on a circle of cardboard and call it a pizza. That's where Jet's is different.

I hadn't even heard of Jet's before receiving the flyer in the mail a few weeks ago. I did some homework and it turns out that they're a fairly large chain. They opened their first store in 1978 in Michigan, started franchising in 1990 and now they've got over 300 shops in 18 states. I'd say that's pretty healthy in a market that's essentially dominated by Papa John's and Domino's. Anyway, history lesson aside, let's get into the food, shall we?

I tried the online ordering process but found it to be a bit buggy and eventually just opted to give them a call. Friendly phone experience. Our coupon was for one of their famous 8-corner pizzas and an order of Jet's Bread for $11.99. Of course, this wouldn't be enough. It never is, is it? To this, we added a medium garden salad and 20oz Pepsi. 

As with every new pizza delivery experience, I expected it to be fraught with mistakes. Happily, I was proven wrong. We were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour when we placed our order. It arrived within 40 minutes. Not only did they get everything right, including every topping on the pizza and the extra jalapeno cheese sauce we asked for, the delivery driver informed me that they were out of 20oz Pepsi's so he brought us 2 16oz bottles instead. No mistakes and a bonus pop? How could it get any better.

The salad was probably the biggest disappointment and I use the word \"disappointment\" gently. It was about as exciting as a salad of its ilk can muster. I really can't blame the salad too much, after all, it did what it could.  It was fresh and plenty for two people, it just wasn't all that special. Romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onions, green peppers, sliced olives and shredded cheddar. It served its purpose of making me feel less like a fat hog for what I was about to do next.

This 8-corner pizza was a thing of beauty. I love bakery style pizza - thick crust with the crispy slightly burned cheese around the edges from the hot pan - and this one hit every note perfectly. I've read that Little Caesers actually ripped this off of Jet's, but I can't substantiate it. What I do know was that I really liked this pizza. 

The crust was thick, fluffy, doughy deliciousness, the sauce tasted fresh with a subtle sweetness and the toppings were all fresh, not canned. As the name inplies, there were actually two smaller pizzas each of 4 pieces. This means all corners. It was just damn good and more then enough for the two of us. We actually got a few more meals out of it. If I had a criticism it would be that I thought the pizza could have used another five minutes in the oven. Personal preference.

The Jet's Bread. I'll keep this one simple. Who the hell doesn't love cheese-covered garlic bread? It's more of their awesome dough, baked golden brown and all crispy like, covered with butter, garlic and mozzarella cheese. It came with a side of pizza sauce for dipping but the real star for me was the jalapeno cheese sauce. Get some. It's loaded with enough artificial ingredients to put down a rhino but it's so good you just won't care.

I don't know what else to say here. I am just as surprised as you are about this review. It's just damn good pizza. Next time, I'll skip the salad."}
{"text":"Jet's is a hidden gem if your a fan of great pizza delivered fast! Being Italian & a Chef for many years I'm very critical when it comes to my pizza and Jets always tops any other fast takeout style pizza shop. Being from Detroit you can find Jets anywhere, but when my family & friends found a location here in Chandler...I don't think we've ordered from anywhere else! 

Just a little national fact for y'all, recent polls show that Detroit has been voted the #2 or #3 city for Pizza 

So don't be a fool and order from Gus' or other wannabe square pizza shops. Call this Jets! 

The owners are super cool and one is typically there offering some great suggestions with a friendly smile. It's hard to find that with other major pizza chains, so for me who loves to support local entrepreneurs & biz I enjoy the full experience eating at Jets here in Chandler. 

Chef Recommendations:
You have to get square here. 
3 words: Detroit Deep Dish (finally in AZ)
The cheesy Jets Bread is ridiculously good to start with. Or a healthy salad ....

Original Specialties you should try:  
Chicken Parmesan
BLT
Aloha BBQ Chicken
Philly Steak 
Eugene Supreme 
Buffalo Ranch Chicken 
Meatball Supremo 

Styles Of Pizza: 
Corner Pizza (for those crazy crust lover)
Deep Dish Duo (for lunch only)

Enjoy"}
{"text":"I was told about Jet's from a colleague from work. It is a bit out of my neck of the woods but I am very happy that I made the effort. The food is great! Pizza made with tasty ingredients and cooked just about as good as you want. I was particularly impressed with the crust. We also got an order of Jets bread which was just as good as the pizza. I was fortunate to be a Le to chat with the owner of this restaurant, cool guy who deserves kudos for the effort he is putting forth to provide us with some really good food."}
{"text":"Jet's seems to understand that pizza does not need to be complicated or sophisticated to be great and hits all the right notes with a delicious and bountiful deep dish pie. Get the bold pepperoni for a classic taste, or try Jet's bacon-y take on Hawaiian."}
{"text":"Detroit style pizza! Deep dish, thick square crust is the signature of Detroit pizza. The pizza is always hot and consistent, our favorite and only go-to chain pizza option. It hits the spot if you're looking for this specific style so I won't speak to their other menu offerings. We usually go for a basic pepperoni or sausage and green peppers and two sides of ranch for a large pizza."}
{"text":"We tried Jet's on a recommendation from friends. Ordered an Italian sub (hot) and a Steak and cheese boat to be delivered (2 blocks away).  Well we should have picked it up. Delivery charge was $3.00? WHAT! Sub was toasted but cold, the tomatoes were sour, as in rotting, and was just a mess trying to eat. The steak thing was absolutely the most horrible tasting whatever it is ingredient laden swill to come out of an oven I have ever tasted. To sum it up I was so starved after waiting an hour to get it that I forced down the sub, but the other thing ended up in the garbage. The salad dressing that came with the sub was good though. all in all the worst $20.00 I ever spent. Maybe I should have just ordered pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was delivered to our Neighborhood community center. It arrived hot and smelled delicious. The delivery guy was friendly and helped process our credit card. We ordered pizza, wings and cheese bread. It was delicious. I would eat here again :-)"}
{"text":"Jets pizza is a walk-up take-out pizza chain from the Midwest. I believe their pizza style is Detroit deep dish. It's heavy, greasy, and delicious. This is my go-to pig out pizza joint in Charlotte. I live just barely out of reach of the two closest locations to be able to get delivery so we always have to go pick it up. They do have our our order saved in their computer so every time we call we can just ask for the same thing as last time and be done with it. 

We always get a large deep dish pizza with the \"turbo crust\", which is basically a garlic butter that's basted onto the crust before baking. The best part of the pizza is the crunchy, chewy crust and the turbo sauce makes it that much better. The pizza is very thick with a good amount of cheese. We can't help but also get the jets bread sticks and a few extra sides of ranch. 

They do have other items like salads, wings, and such, but we've been hooked on the same item we've had since day one. I imagine everything is kind of the same fast food quality like the pizza. 

You'll feel it the next day if you eat too much, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"happiness: all you need is the 8 corner pizza with the turbo crust. there's almost always a coupon for it on their website, which makes it a ridiculous $12."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Staff is under trained. Can't handle being busy the place falls apart. 30-45 minutes means over 60 minute wait with no more than we couldn't predict. \"We give the same time to everyone. Nothing we can do\" with how many years in business they should be able to predict holiday wait times."}
{"text":"This place is awesome , I love there pizza . I love there hand toss crush or there deep dish .there saldes are good as well. The staff is friendly ."}
{"text":"Jet's has converted me to deep dish pizza. I've always enjoyed the crunch of thin crust pizza because I don't have a preference for soggy pizza. Jet's deep dish isn't soggy at all and has a nice crisp bite to its crust all around. Their service so far has been excellent and they deliver in a reasonable amount of time. Officially my go to."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from here a couple Sunday's ago and am still thinking about it. The game day deal is amazing! They messed up my order but it didn't even matter that they couldn't figure out how to put veggies on only one side of the butter, parm, and garlic soaked rectangle. This would be the \"turbo crust.\" Do yourself a favor. It will cheer you up on another losing Sunday, plus it was so big it fed 2 of the neighbor kids!"}
{"text":"Good, big salads (the large size) and good pizza. The owner has been a great supporter of community groups, and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Jet Pizza has the best ever Deep Dish Pizza. I get the Jet10 with Turbo crust. 10 toppings:  Pizza sauce, premium mozzarella, pepperoni, ham, hamburger, Italian sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions, green peppers & black olives, and the Turbo crust:  A delicious combination of butter, Romano cheese and garlic. 2 slices and I am full."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food.  Always quick and courteous.  My recommendation is the Philly cheesestake deep dish."}
{"text":"I never heard of Jets before until we drove by and saw this new place open. On pizza night we decided to order takeout. we got the pepperoni pizza with turbo crust and Parmesan bread. it was very delicious. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We tried Jet's on two separate occasions because its location is close by. 
None of the 3 pizzas we tried tasted bad, but I thought there was absolutely  no freshness or \"natural goodness\" to any of it. Instead, artificial flavoring and junk food is what came to my mind. 

Here's a hint : when you make a pizza with with good, fresh ingredients you don't need to offer 8 kinds of \"flavorized\" (sic) crust.

ps it may look vaguely like Sicilian , from a distance ... if you squint your eyes ... but it's definitely NOT Sicilian pizza. Good grief."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but delivery takes 1.5+ hours every time. Absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Pizza is a very subjective topic. With that said, their deep dish pizza and turbo sticks are very good. I'm usually a NY style guy, but their thick crust is good."}
{"text":"I loved this pizza for years. My family and I have ordered jets pizza at least twice a week for two years. This is the only pizza we ate. We had a couple of issues with the new employees but we moved past it. But after multiple attempts of ordering with long delivery times we decided to choose mamas for twice the money. They always delivered a consistent pizza and their delivery times were accurate not an hour late. So after a year or so  I decided to try my old favorite. My number is still in the system hopefully with the notes of what I like, extra sauce and lite cheese. I love pizza and the cheese destroys my \"eating healthy\". The gentleman who answered the phone was nice and great delivery time. Guess what, the pizza barely had sauce on it at all and a whole bunch of cheese. I am furious so my wife called to avoid a bad situation. The gentleman offered to deliver the correct pizza after he finished his shift and that was nice. I work at 530 am and the pizza I wouldn't see until 11pm.  The small things always destroy a business. I own enough of them(businesses) to know this is the truth. Love the sauce and dough but they cannot deliver the correct pizza time and time again. If you would like a \"good\" pizza order from them but expect \"good\" service and pizza."}
{"text":"I've only had the deep dish pizza, but it is soooo good. Usually shy away from chains, but tried a piece of pepperoni when they first opened and was pleasantly surprised. Since then, I've had the Philly cheese and Chicken Alfredo. Loaded with cheese and toppings on a crust good enough to eat by itself."}
{"text":"After returning to our trusty Yelp app to find another restaurant that provides pizza and wings we stumbled upon Jet's pizza on Tatum & Shea. It wasn't too far away so we were able to get them to deliver.
I perused their website and found something I haven't seen at any other pizza location, save Little Caesars back in the 90s: deep dish pizza. I haven't had a good deep dish pizza in a long long while so I decided to give it a try.

I am so totally glad I found this place.

The pizza was incredible. The wings were exactly what they were supposed to be: delicious and mildly spicy with bones. 

My child actually ate almost all of the plain boneless wings and complemented them by saying they were better than any chicken strips she'd had at any of the other pizza places around our house.

Pizza is a big deal in our house as it is a staple and ordered/made once a week. They will definitely be added to the rotation and far more often than any other place near our house."}
{"text":"Oh Boy...went back to Jet's to try something different.
I have to say, the 8 Corner Pizza is very good...this is a must...still not Chicago, but its thick and very tasty.....
Great recovery Jet's!!!"}
{"text":"Order pizza at 430
Received like warm pizza at 630
Did not offer any compensation 
Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. ...... 1 hour and 45 minutes for 2 pizzas with delivery 3 miles away . 1st and last time . Wish I could have given less then 1 star . Called 4 times and was told by the so called Manger that it was already gone each time and when it finally did arrive was told by the driver it just came out of the oven 5 minutes ago . When looking for pizza in the neighborhood drive yourself to one of the real shops"}
{"text":"A little different than most Pgh pizza places. Thick crust. Sauce is tasty. A little greasy but not bad. Will definitely return and try other menu items."}
{"text":"It's Jet's!!! Michigan is home to 4 of the big 6 pizza chains. Dominos, Hungry Howies, Little Caesars, and Jet's Pizza!!! They mastered the Detroit Deep Dish and it is a game changer. The crispy crunchy crust of a Jets Pizza is THE BEST. It's been my favorite since Michigan, but since I've moved out to AZ it has been about 3 years since I've had real pizza. Real mozzarella cheese, not the stuff other places claim is mozzarella when it's actually a blend of American and mozzarella. Everything about this pizza is the best.

Stop reading this review!!! Call them! It's the best! Let's! Get! Jet's!"}
{"text":"Jets is delicious. You will not find any pizza place in town that gives better pizza than Jets. As a frequent goer, I recommend the 8 corner pepperoni with cheese on the crust. Also, the barbecue chicken will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have had Jets Pizza many times.   I have tried and liked their Pan, thin crust, and gluten free pies.

The pan crust is very filling and has a crispy edge.   The thin crust reminds me of pizzas that I ate in Ohio (small square pieces).    The gluten free pizza (my new favorite) comes in a smaller portion (a little bigger than a personal pan pizza) at 120 Calories a slice / who pizza has 6 slices).  The gluten free pizza tastes good in my opinion).

The price of the pizzas are in line with other delivery places I order from ~ $15-18 for a large.

If you want to mix it up - give this a try."}
{"text":"Coming from Detroit, I look forward to going back each year to visit the family AND to savor the awesomeness of an authentic Loui's deep dish pizza. For the record, an authentic Detroit deep dish pizza, rooted in Buddy's out of Hamtramck, is THE BAR to which all great Detroit pizzas aspire.Nothing like Chicago deep dish AT ALL!   

Buddy's sold to outside investors anxious to sell franchises, but Loui, a Frenchman who CREATED the ACTUAL recipe for Buddy's, wanted no part of the expansion and instead opted for HIS OWN place in a city adjacent to Detroit, Hazel Park. Loui's is a full service restaurant in a working class neighborhood that I'll visit twice in 4 days! On rare occasion, I MIGHT hit up Buddy's if Loui's is closed, but NEVER AGAIN. on a 10-10 scale, Loui's is a 15, Buddy's a 7 at best. 

Now to Jet's....  My brothers told me that often times they'll pick up or order in from Jet's if they lack the time for their #1 choice - Loui's - and told me it was pretty darn close to Loui's and really good. Naturally I had to try it, and was delighted to find one in Phoenix. A drag there isn't a location closer to me in North Phoenix but worth the drive once or twice a month for my Detroit fix. 

The ticket is to ask them to cook it 3/4. Take it home and preheat your oven at between 350-400 degrees with a cookie sheet AND a piece of foil in the oven while it is heating. Remove and put your pizza ( I recommend the 4 corner to you can enjoy the best part in every piece) on the foil and place in that hot oven for about 15 minutes and you have got some awesome pizza! I always opt for light sauce as I prefer it NOT drenched in tomato sauce. 

So how does the pizza rate and stack up against Loui's? Let me frame it this way; it's not Loui's, but it's pretty darn close and certainly WAY better than Buddy's, so I'd give it an 8.5, maybe a 9! In any case, it is the best we have here in the Valley, HANDS DOWN, unless you are fixated on thin crust pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional, very late. We called and asked when delivery could be expected as they were twenty minutes late, we were told we were not the only people they had to deliver to and it would be there when it got there. I asked them to talk to a manger, he said he was the manager, so I asked to talk to someone who was not so rude, I supposedly was given to the owner who purely made excuses for his manger. We used to eat here about 3 to 4 times a month, never again will this company get another of my dimes! At this rate I give this company about one more year till they are out of business!"}
{"text":"If I could get this particular store rating to be a 0 I would. I'm a first time customer whose wife loves Jet Pizza.  I place the order for pizza and wings, being that this is my first time ordering from this franchise I didn't know that sauce must be paid when ordering up front. The clerk wanted to charge my wife for sauce by charging my card. Now, I know the economy is sliding but, I don't think two ranch cups are gonna close this store.I asked to speak to manager, 01/31/17 7:45PM and he was very rude and hung up the phone in my face. I will never use this franchise again. So much for trying to help out the small chains with service like this there reason why they are considered to be small and extinct. Good luck and here's to your successful career at servicing the American consumer with that type of people skills being a manager."}
{"text":"Really, really good! I had half meat and half cheese and a sub. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Love the corner pizza! It's delicious and deep dish. I usually get one slice for $1.85 with pepperoni. It's delicious and quick and cheap."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance...but I kinda regret it. I ordered their \"NY Style\" pizza, but for anyone who has ever had an actual slice in NYC, this isn't even close. When I opened the top of the pizza box it was literally nothing but a pool of grease. The delivery guy was nice and it arrived hot and early so no issues there but, man, the quality is just not up to snuff. I also ordered light sauce and that didn't happen either. Looks like this \"jet\" didn't even clear the runway."}
{"text":"I got a hot sandwich. A Jets deli boat.  Cute cashier, friendly and perky.

{"text":"Love this place. I first had their pizza at a school fundraising event. I always overlooked their pizzeria but I'm glad I discovered this little hidden gem. They have a great selection to choose from. Subs, salads,calzones, wings, cheesy bread sticks and more. Their turbo jet crust is yummy. Some other reviewer said why go with them and pay more than $5 when you can go to dominoes? Obviously the choice to me is clear... Jets pizza is better than any dominoes pizza HANDS DOWN! My taste buds refuse to eat dominoes."}
{"text":"Started great with the ordering. Quick painless. Didn't have to repeat the order five times. Pizza came when it was supposed to. Hot. The best deep dish crust I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Know what to expect:. Ambiance of a Lil Caesars, more options, slightly better quality, a few 2-person round metal tables in the waiting area.  However, this is no Venezias ... Far from it.  I'm being generous with 3 stars.  Really.  Lil Caesars originated in Michigan.  Keep that in mind when MI transplants review Jet :)"}
{"text":"Jet's Pizza is a chain from Michigan, but don't hold that against them.

Their menu is pretty much the same as all the major competitors - pizza, wings, salads, bread, subs, dessert, and soda. That's where the similarity ends.

The pan pizza (available in small, large, and extra large) blows away their competitors. It has the correct amount of mouth feel (buttery). The standard pizza sauce is fairly good too. They offer 8 different crust toppers. 

Their bread ($5-6) is just ok. Marco's is much better. But Jet's offers better choices for dipping sauce, such as jalapeno cheese sauce.

Online ordering, while convenient, is horrible. As in it took 8 minutes to place an order. Will definitely call next time."}
{"text":"Lunch special-- 2 slices and a drink $5.  What a deal.... just not a very tasty deal.  The slices are the \"deep dish\" style, and I guess I don't really care for extra doughy pizza... especially when it doesn't have enough sauce and pepperoni to complement the dough. 
I might be back, but not getting the deep dish version... BTW, I was eating with a native Chicagoan, and he left most of the dough..... a far cry from \"real\" deep dish."}
{"text":"The one other Phoenix location in Paradise Valley finally opened, and it's still a 40 minute drive each way but I planned my day around it this time. I ordered a pepperoni pizza to go, picked it up and brought it home. Of course, it was cold by the time I got it home so I put it in the oven.

The pizza is very similar to Pizza Huts pan pizza. It has that airy, thick, pan pizza crust. A little too much bread, a little too crunchy (almost thought I chipped a tooth) but the edges of the crust taste amazing.

The pizza over-all was good. Not great and not bad. I certainly wouldn't drive this far for it again. However, if a location was opened on the west side of Phoenix, I would certainly order and pick-up food from there again. Otherwise, it's not worth the hassle. Apart from the shape, I can get a pan pizza from Pizza Hut and it is almost indiscernible from texture and flavor."}
{"text":"One of the top three pizza places in the area. It is a chain of pizza shops but it is very good considering that it's a chain. Try the 8 corner pizza it is excellent"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza terrible management. Ordered an extra large pizza with turbo crust and did not receive turbo crust. I called back and spoke with the manager Aricka Dean and told her there was no butter on our crust. She then proceeded to argue with me for 5-10 minutes about how our pizza did have butter on it. I told her we can't see any butter and she said it's impossible to see butter. What? Every time I've ordered turbo crust not only can you see the color of the butter (yellow) you can see it dripping off the edge of the crust. Then I told her we can't taste the butter either. She kept telling me that there was butter and that she saw the cook put the butter on there herself. I told her I have a total of 4 people eating the pizza saying there is absolutely no butter. She continues to argue and then suddenly tells me she will comp my next order. Huh? Why the sudden change of heart? If she literally saw my pizza being made and she herself saw the butter being applied and decided to argue with me for 10 minutes why did she change her stance so suddenly? I wonder if she was lying about watching the cook make my pizza and found out mid conversation that the cook had forgotten or the order was mislabeled. In the case she was going to comp my next order anyway, why argue with me for so long about it? Anyhow the pizza is always good."}
{"text":"The pizza is horrible! The quality of the ingredients speak volumes. The pizza is not worth the price they charge."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. It's my very favorite pizza place! The folks who answer the phone are helpful and accommodating, the delivery drivers are kind and quick, and I've never had a bad experience (or a bad pizza!) Thanks for being such a great neighborhood pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Friendly service. Our go to spot for pizza.
Only downside is we wish it were closer to us! But it's worth the quick drive to come here. Nothing near our house comes close to the quality.."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza every time. I continually get the deep dish and its baked to perfection. 20 mins out the door if you pick up but delivery can be quite a wait. Typically an hour. Worth the wait but grab and go is the best choice. Hands down my favorite in the area."}
{"text":"With my sister unable to travel due to being in hospice being told we are out of the service area after FIVE YEARS of delivery from the Weslake location, this disservice is disappointing. The westlake \"general manager\" is rude and needs to train their implores of setting needs to be set in place. Having been told \"if we aren't busy then we would\" doesn't mean anything when most of the time we order on Saturdays. Having worked in a pizza place, saturdays are the busiest days. 
Thanks for allowing us to go with someone else!"}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty tasty! You've got to get the four corner deep dish pizza, it reminds me of my childhood and eating that crispy, slightly greasy, Pizza Hut pizza mmm. Just make sure you get a side of sauce to dip you slices into because you are dealing with a thicker crust here. I will definitely be back for the pizza, but I wouldn't recommend the wings. They are pretty small and average on taste."}
{"text":"While they may be some of the only seriously deep dish around, they do not disappoint. Nice crispy crunch of the crust, fluffier and just right. Add a little Romano cheese on top, a beer on the side, game over."}
{"text":"Yeah! Oh Yeah! The Jet's Pizza with Cajun seasoned crust is fantastic. I find it joyful to keep it simple at Jet's and by that I mean go for pepperoni with jalapeños with the aforementioned cajun crust. This was you get the full flavor of the dough and wonderful sauce with the cajun seasoning. MMMMM!
It's also nice to drop in on a late evening or for lunch or anytime and grab the 2 slices for $5.00 with a fountain drink! 
The Calzones are wonderfully delicious as well. I really think it is the crust with some sort of addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it nightly!! What ever it is it makes both the pizza and the calzone memorable in my book."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple of times. Pizza slices and subs. 
1st experience; Good pizza and drink lunch combo. Fresh pizza
2nd experience: okay pizza; GREASY crust. 
3rd experience: since I was turned off to the pizza now i decided to try the sub. Figured it would be less greasy. I was wrong. Who wants a greasy sub? The pizza bread/crust seems to bake in a lot of cooking oil. 

Grilled chicken sub; chicken was not fresh it was bagged re-heated chicken. 

Last attempt at eating food at this location."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but they gave me plain crust when I ordered turbo crust for the second time... so I can't judge their flavored crusts... if the even exist. ):"}
{"text":"It's just like I remember back in Michigan!!! It's been more than 20 years since I had Jets pizza, just outside Detroit. I've been craving that crust for all these years and Jets did not disappoint. BEST PIZZA AROUND!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is always decent here, however, if you pay nearly $10 for a garden salad, I'm sure you would expect all of the veggies listed on their menu, and not just a couple pieces of each....and I wouldn't expect to pay all that money for straight lettuce. I can buy a head of lettuce for under $1. Why would I pay that much for iceberg? Absolutely ridiculous. So disappointed! What a waste of money! I saw the picture someone posted of the salad, and thought they were exaggerating; absolutely not! Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"I have been eating Jets from this location for about a year now. I have to say it is really good. I love the 8 corner pizza, bravo whoever thought that one up! Whenever they deliver to Bay the pie is always hot and tastes great. Hard to get that from delivery these days. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent pizza. I ordered a small deep dish pepperoni and black olives and enjoyed it very much.

I had the jet turbo crust and it was great!

The small deep dish is definitely enough for one person."}
{"text":"I will make this review very quick and easy.  Probably the best pizza I have had in this area(Fairview).  Only had the deep dish, but if there regular is half as good, you are in for a real treat.  Coupons online...good value.  Highly recommend.

Value         B
Service      A
Food Taste   A

HIGHLY RECOMMEND JET\"S"}
{"text":"Hollywood Video folded and the vacated space at the corner of Green & Neil is now split between Hollywood Liquors and this pizza joint.

The pizza is simple, but actually very good.

The deep dish is most similar to Garcia's."}
{"text":"We love the barbecue chicken pizza. It is so delicious. We are so glad they have a store in Az. We used to get it in NC. We drive an hour round trip to get this amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and very inexpensive.  Owners are also very involved and accommodating."}
{"text":"Detroit style pizza? What is that? Grew up in Chicago, been to NY often, even heard of Buffalo style pizza, but Detroit? Well, I'm a fan and it is unique. It's like a loaf of garlic bread, minus the garlic, topped with pizza toppings. Tasty and grease filled for those moments when you need to eat your feelings or watching a game.

Ask them about their coupons / promos, they have them like most pizza places and get yourself some satisfaction!"}
{"text":"I know this chain is big in Detroit. Ordered once so far. An 8 corner pizza. Was very good, want another right now. Excited to have another alternative to Barro's for quality pickup pizza in Chandler!

Update 11/27/16:
We order this pizza so much. Stand by my original review. Owners and employees are really dedicated to giving customers a great experience. Only have eaten the deep dish, but stuff is like crack. We're addicted! You've been warned..."}
{"text":"Great delivery pizza. We always order the pepperoni with pineapple. Comes out great. Pan crust."}
{"text":"This location and the Matthews location are the best Jets ever.. even beat the original Michigan ones."}
{"text":"Awesome and quick service! Delicious pizza, subs and salads. The perfect order in for a late study night and very helpful staff :) they deliver to the place!"}
{"text":"I had some pizza from the \"Pizza Wars\" event helde on March 23, 2013 at the Doghouse.  It was pretty good.  I went by on Friday to get some it was okay.  I ordered the deep dish cheese with chicken.  I may have to try a different topping.  I will agree its a little pricey."}
{"text":"Their Detroit-style deep dish is the best pizza I've ever had.

Literally, this is the best pizza I have ever eaten.  I have had their standard round pizza at a work function and it was just \"ok\".

My gal and I have had pizza from this Jet's several times and it is consistently excellent.  The 8 corner pizza with pepperoni and grilled chicken is unbeatable.

We have jokingly (but not jokingly at all?) put their pizza on our \"last day on Earth\" food must have, solidly as the lunch selection.

Keep up the good work.

The dining area is pretty clean and the staff is always helpful and attentive.  The website is not great.. that is my only gripe."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I've only had the deep dish (and I like that you can order by the slice...quick, cheap meal), but service seems pretty lousy. The kid who rang me up the one time had grease all over his hands and clearly wasn't using gloves while he went back and forth from the pizza and the cash register. Also, I don't think I've ever had a friendly interaction there. Jersey Mike's next door has a young staff, too, but they tend to be much nicer. I dunno, I mean, I know it's a chain, but that almost makes it more surprising how disorganized it seems."}
{"text":"We've ordered about 5 times from here and have really enjoyed the food.  We like the 8 sided pizza and breadsticks with the garlic butter sauce (i believe it is called Turbo sauce).  We call in our orders and we don't have to wait long on the phone.  The staff is always really friendly when we pick up."}
{"text":"I updated this review after trying the turbo crust on a deep dish pepperoni that was pretty darn good. I have only had delivery so I can't speak on the inside of the restaurant but all our order have been quick and good for lazy nights when you don't want to go out."}
{"text":"Do you remember in elementary school what day they would serve the square pizza? I think it was a Wednesday. Anyways that's the kind of pizza you'll be eating at JETS. It's elementary school pizza! Poor quality cheese, hard \"scrape the roof of your mouth\" crust and subpar toppings. Based on how mediocre their pizza is I would expect the price to be much lower. The only positive note was the friendly cashier. Other than that you're better off picking up a RED BARON from Publix."}
{"text":"Good pizza, long wait. One anchovy per slice is rather skimpy. Clean inside and friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza for the first time tonight. I was hoping for delivery, but we live too far for them to deliver. After reading all the reviews I decided to drive the 11 miles to pick it up. We ordered the Hawaiian deep dish and boneless wings. Strangely enough I'm not a big pizza fan, but I am a fan of this pizza now! It's the first Hawaiian pizza I've had with bacon. I could have used a little more, or stronger, pineapple, but no other complaints! It was really, really good! We liked the boneless wings as well. They were very friendly while ordering and picking up. He gave me a coupon without me even asking. I would give them 5 stars if they delivered further out and if we could have tasted the pineapple more."}
{"text":"Jet's pizza is amazing! Definitely become a staple in my boyfriend and I's go to meals after a long night at work or just when we're in the mood for some deliciousness. The service is always friendly and you can taste the happy that goes into these pies :) Recommended for anyone that loves good food!"}
{"text":"Picked up order and it was ready. Purple haired clerk was not very friendly.  The pizza is along the same lines a Dominos and Pizza Hut. The garlic bread sticks were very doughy and Pizza Hut bread sticks are a lot better. Cinnamon sticks are ok nothing great.  Basically you have the typical fast food pizza here."}
{"text":"You want Sicilian pizza, here it is!  Now, these guys call it deep dish, but nonetheless, it's delicious.  This is one of two places in Charlotte that I think has good pizza.  They give you tons of pepperoni and it's crispy.  The crust is perfect.  It has a light crisp on the outside and is doughy on the inside, exactly what I expect from a sicilian.  This is my first order from here, and I will be back...but not like Arnold, more like a NY Italian transplant.  They factor in tips for delivery into the pricing, which I like, because it is something that a company that respects its employees would do."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I have been looking for a \"calzone\" that is like the calzone at Hungry Howie's. Finally found it!! Tried fire station and it was okay. But Jet's nailed it!! Highly recommend it!! 

They also have great prices :)"}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite food of all and I have never found a pizza place that rivals my hometown pizza from WV, however, Jet's just may be that place!  I usually have to get thin crust because most crusts are \"doe-y\" and constipating but the thick 4 corner Jet's slices are not doe-y and are crisp, light & airy. I have tried their thin crust as well & it is good too but nothing beats their 4 corner! So glad I found this place, have been back more times than I can count. My search for a great pizza is over. Never had a bad one yet!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  They don't skimp on the cheese and it's the good stuff!  Wings and salads are great too.  You can dine in now too."}
{"text":"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I told him I was dissatisfied with my pizza.  they explained their process,I was willing to pay additional to have more than one piece of chicken on each slice of pizza and they still were willing to send me away dissatisfied!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here with modest expectations.  They have slices, yes slices.  I got the pepperoni. It was good pizza. The  bottom of the pizza was crispy but it was a butter or oil type of crispy. I have not eaten at Pizza Hut on many moons but that is what the bottom\crust reminded me of.  It was good but did not have that mom and pop pizza place taste.    I got he deep dish by the way.

Anyone remember Scotto's Pizza at Randall Park Mall that was the best pizza I could remember as a kid?"}
{"text":"Finally tried it and it is DELICIOUS!

Got a deep dish pizza and it was so good!  If came quick and was nice and hot!

Cant wait to try everything else!!!"}
{"text":"Had two slices on a Saturday night, one sausage and one loaded, total was $4.37 with tax.  Greasy, but good taste and crunchy thick crust.  Good value, but not the greatest pizza I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza, good pricing, and a friendly staff. 
I'm addicted to the deep dish eight sided style."}
{"text":"I was told this was the place that I absolutely had to try.  Without reading any written reviews I opted to see for myself.  First thought.  Not what I envisioned as I spotted the place.  Still determined to discover what this recommendation was all about we placed our order with a little guidance from the employee manning the counter.

Talk about options when ordering a pizza!  They do simplify it by using a step be step process allowing you to order it your way. Start with the size, topping choice, choice of pizza crust (deep dish, hand tossed, NY style and thin).  For an extra bonus you can flavorize  your crust with no additional cost.  7 flavor options available.  I never mixed poppy seed with my pizza but I am willing to give it a try sometime. Apparently, most people order the turbo crust. This is made up of butter, garlic, and romano  cheese.

They also have 11 types of specialty pizzas as well.  The Jet 10 comes with cheese, pepperoni, ham, hamburger, Italian sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions, green pepper and black olives. Another specialty pizza is the  8 corner pizza.  No fighting for the corners on this one!

In addition to some great pizza options, they also offer salads, boneless wings, subs and cheese bread sticks.
We opted to try a slice of the deep dish because this style was available by the slice.  We ordered a large NY style to go.  The menu prices are in line with most other pizza places.
The deep dish slice tasted very good and it had a wonderful texture.  Not a heavy doughy
crust yet it was thick, crunchy and light tasting.  Very pleasing.  Not something I would order consistently as my go to pizza but it would be something I crave repeatedly over time.
The NY style was  average and had very little taste to it..

I noticed they promote the fact that there are 350 locations. 
Overall, I am planning to revisit Jet's Pizza and give some of the other menu options a try."}
{"text":"Yay!! It took a couple of month since moving here, but we finally found our go-to place for pizza!  I love the crust choices and crust enhancers....my fav is sesame seeds.

And they deliver...yipeee!"}
{"text":"Awesome salads, awesome pizza almost always.  The only reason I'm giving a 4 not a 5 is because the pizza is never consistent.   Most of the times it's great, but you never know if it's going to be a grease pit or not.   The staff is always changing and you never know if your getting a nice & courteous employee or a jerk about to ring you up.  Don't they know if I'm picking up a pizza that 15 seconds of speaking nicely and smiling will get them a tip?"}
{"text":"This Detroit style pizza is my absolute favorite! I had a feeling this was going to be a new love of mine just from looking at the pictures before we went here. I love the all-around crispiness of each piece of pizza! We went with the Old Faithful - pepperoni! It was so good!! We are in trouble now! This is going to be the only pizza I want from now on.
We even got this to go! What eating it at home it was still crispy and not soggy at all!! 
The one downside, is the price. It is a little pricey, but I can see why! Everything is so fresh! We just need one  in the West Valley now!"}
{"text":"FINALLY decent pizza in Arizona! I come from the midwest where two local pizza restaurants have won international awards for their pizza, so I am picky. Jet's four & eight corner pizza are delicious; the traditional curst is awesome too! Typically pizza is so awful in Arizona that I contacted a friend about franchising one of the restaurants from my hometown just to get decent pizza. Get the curst well done and it is to die for. Love that they deliver too. Thanks to my Minibar delivery guy for turning us on to Jet's. Jet's is our new go to pizza."}
{"text":"These guys know that you can't make great pizza without great water.  I tried their deep dish. The crust was delicious and the cheese was grade A+. I think they make their sauce from scratch and it was really good, authentic red sauce. I hope to see more Jet's Pizza Restaurants in Arizona. The exceeded all of my expectations and I hope everyone will support them."}
{"text":"Great pizza and fast delivery. Driver even called to let me know he'd be a few minutes late. I'll definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place as it's brand new to Arizona. I ordered a Ham Deep Dish pizza (which they're known for) and I have to say it's a really tasty pizza. I would say it ranks higher than most of the other chain pizza places nearby. The staff was really nice and customer oriented. 

The pizza itself was cooked perfectly and had a great crunch. Overall, would definitely hit up this place again for deep dish pizza. I think next time I'll have to try their jet bread..."}
{"text":"Jet's is our go-to pizza of the month. An expensive habit? Yes.

We ordered almost the exact same menu items as last time; but I requested that bacon just cover half of our BLT pizza. 

Hubs went to pick-up the order and the staff informed him that they made and error with the BLT...we ended up with two BLT's for the price of one.

Amazing customer service on their part and kudos to whomever caught the mistake (my husband, bless him, wouldn't have) and didn't let my husband leave with an incorrect order.

In addition to the admitted mistake, they willingly gave the us the incorrect pizza and didn't just throw it away. Heck yes. Do you know how many restaurants I've been to where they've incorrectly made food and just thrown it away? Too many to count. I hate to see food wasted and I appears Jet's does, too.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is what all pizza should taste like! Good service. The square cut pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at 1130am on Sunday morning. I ordered online to Lyndhurst store. It arrived fairly quickly, but was nothing like what I ordered I contacted the store and was told I was delivered the wrong pizza and I would be \"called back\" regarding my replacement pizza shortly. 45 minutes later, no call, no pizza. I called them back and got \" Oh, do you want us to remake it?\" I ended up having to drive up there to return the pizza and get my money back. No offer to make things right,  nothing. I ordered a pizza from them 2 hours prior and I'm delivering a pizza to them, hungry as hell I might add. This was my first and last time with Jets pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza crust is what makes the pizza amazing. Their deep dish crust is utterly amazing. So glad we found this place. We had ordered the regular crust and they gave us a sample square of the deep dish, ohhhh it was amazing."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick slice but they were out so I waiting and bought a speciality pizza. The wait was about 15mins but completely worth it. They have a huge varies for a great prices"}
{"text":"Great provolone and mozz cheese blend with the crusty burnt edges from a well oiled-pan. This is the pizza I grew up eatng and making at the local pizza place. Recommended for a try."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Jets on multiple occasions. 
Every time we've ordered. The food just gets worse.
I'm unsure if the management has changed or if it's just the quality or if they just don't care.
But, our pizza arrives cold and soggy.
We usually order a BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple and an order of bread with bacon. 
The bread was hard as a rock and the pizza had a funky taste, almost like some thing was starting to go bad. 
We threw it out.
I don't think we'll be ordering from this location again. We'll drive out to the Willoughby location and pick up."}
{"text":"So glad we found a little slice of home in AZ. The square style loaded with amazing toppings and quick fast service equate to what we know and love from the D."}
{"text":"Moving to Phoenix from Detroit I was very sad to find out there was no jets pizza but then I found this location & thank God. Their pizza is amazing (all the food on the menu really) they aren't an over priced pizza spot either. My boyfriend & I order an XL (18 pieces) pizza for only 22! That's a steal & they have great crust flavors!"}
{"text":"First time here lastnight. Lucky them since yogi's would not take my order 15 minutes before they closed.

Got the deep dish pizza and antipasto salad. All was very good and the pizza much much better then expected."}
{"text":"If you were expecting to dine-in, you thought wrong. There is a singular bench for customers to sit on while waiting for their pizza and that's it. I'm fine with that though. Pizza is pretty good - I'm partial to the 8-corner pizza and they have a nice crust. The bread is very garlicky. Their ranch is amazing!!! But if you order one on the side, make sure they've put it in your box before you leave the shop - I've paid for an extra side of ranch twice and both times I had to go back in and remind them that I ordered it. I also recommend their Turbo crust seasoning - just a great addition to an already tasty pizza. I wouldn't try showing up any earlier than they say your pizza will be ready. I've called in and sent in an order online and both times I still had to wait when I had arrived on time to pick up my pizza. I know it's a new locale for them, and they clearly have room to improve, but overall I'm still glad to have it right down the street. Pricier than Pizza Hut or Domino's, but if you're looking for something more than the average chain pizza, this is a refreshing change."}
{"text":"I've had Jet's before in the Toledo area. Their cheesy bread has a legendary reputation (with my cousin.) 

I wanted my wife to try the pizza, as I remembered really enjoying it. 

I placed an order with my cellular telephone, and she went to retrieve the pizza. It was a small pepperoni: a little square of magic. 

Delicious. 5-star guy strikes again."}
{"text":"Hands down best tasting pizza! This is my go-to pizza spot. They also sell slices which is nice for a quick bite/lunch! Try this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced. $14 for a small. Not worth it. Pizza Hut next time. Ordered a Hawaiian, not great at all."}
{"text":"Love this place and the people who work here are super nice and the food taste amazing it's my new fav pizza. They have so many options."}
{"text":"I tried it. I DO like the pizza and my son LOVED the boneless wings. However, I have worked at plenty of restaurants in my day. When your staff is young, there WILL be horsing around. It isn't like I have no sense of humor, but with the things you see posted online , goofing around and food is just a no-go these days.  If your staff goofs around for a moment or two, fine. If it is in front of customers, not so much. When I picked up my last order, as the girl at the register turned around to get my food from the heater, she had two perfect flour hand prints on her behind. Yeah my 20yr old self giggled, but my older self said--I hope you washed those hands before you went back to making my order.  Food--good, me wondering if you wash ----not so good."}
{"text":"If you like thick crust super soft pizza this is your place!   I forgot how good this pizza was!  I had it last in 2013 and fly into Cleveland and the min I drove by heading into DTW I pulled a u-turn and ordered a pizza on the fly!  Try this place and you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte bar none.

Have went to this well many a time and have not been disappointed. Go with the small deep dish to serve two or the 8 corner deep dish for delicious leftovers or serves 3-4 (get turbo crust obviously). Add pepperoni and you are set. Pro Tip: get ranch on the side ftw"}
{"text":"We use to love this pizza joint... sadly it's losing its quality. 
All food was cold when it arrived, the cheese on the cheese sticks wasn't cooked thoroughly and their \"Deep Dish\" isn't actually a Deep Dish. It's just a thicker crust. If you look up the definition of Deep Dish, it refers to the Chicago style pizza that holds toppings between 2 layers. EVERYONE KNOWS THIS. Theirs is just a taller pizza- very similar to every single other pizza places \"pan pizza.\" The Deep Dish breadsticks are literally the exact same as their regular- I know bc I ordered both. Lol
I even called thinking I misordered or they accidentally sent a regular pizza- nope. They confirmed \"that is OUR Deep Dish.\" Huge fail."}
{"text":"Happen to be in the area and saw they had slices and wow it was so good fresh and crunchy how I love it ! Made my day!"}
{"text":"I indulge in their lunch special a few times a month. It's a 5 dollar 2 slice deal with a 20 oz beverage. I give them four stars because their pepperoni pizza is some of the best pan pizza around. I've tried the Hawaiian and the combination pizzas as well, but they don't hold a candle to their pepperoni. 

I always do carry out and they've been prompt with the goods. Once it took over ten minutes, but most of the time I get a pizza and drink within five minutes of walking in."}
{"text":"First, I will say this was my first experience at Jets. They're closer to my home than your norm pizza spots like Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns. So we have them a try. 

Pizza is a weekly staple in our home, so we know something abt pizza. One thing we don't like is when the cheese slides off the pizza leaving the sauce and dough, but taking all your toppings. But when it was hot, it wasn't too bad. 

But the positive, is they sale a pound of wings (like 12 - 15) for like $6.99 - $7.99 depending on flavor. They were absolutely amazing. And usually I don't praise food at a restaurant that I can make at home, but I would go back just for wings! 

Wings mean  more to me than pizza do that's the reason for a 4 star. :)"}
{"text":"Can't understand the poor reviews here!  I had two Sicilian Pepperoni slices and was thrilled with the pizza!  A nice crust that was thick, chewy, and a fantastic sauce!  I'd come back again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I was served Jet's pizza at a local charity event. OMG! How long has this place been around? How long have I been missing out on this? At the event, they were offering up a few taste options, but I kept coming back for pepperoni. My favorite. The slices are thick. Hot and cheesy. Great tasting crust. And I am one to not typically eat my crust. I'm impressed. I think it is like the Pizza Hut pan pizza, but better. I think I will grab some slices for lunch next time I am home for a visit."}
{"text":"I accidentally called Jets when looking for the number for my usual pizza spot. It cost more than the same pizza at Mama's, it's smaller and it looks and tastes like fast food pizza rather than the authentic Italian pizza that I prefer. On top of that the person who took the order over the phone was not friendly at all and acted like we were wasting her time. My daughter said she could feel her eyes rolling. I wish I could give them 0 stars. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I recently had a dealsaver for $10 for $20 worth of pizza. On 7/7 I called to inquire about specials. She named a list of several and I took her up on one. Upon ordering I informed them that I have a dealsaver and the female informed me that I couldn't order any specials as I cant combine coupons. The dealsaver isn't technically a coupon nor is the specials--they are specials vs coupons. The female then placed the same order and the total jumped $17 from $30 to $47. It was evident that I was missing out on $17 worth of specials for a $10 savings. I explained to the female that again I wasn't combining coupons and she reluctantly agreed bringing my total again down $17. Upon showing up at my door, the receipt which had already been charged, was again back up $17. I called and asked to speak to the manager and explained to him that I wasn't combining coupons, simply taking them up on their specials--not to mention a dealsaver shouldn't constitute a coupon. The manager was extremely rude, not in the least understanding, and didn't have any objection to me sending the pizza back. I reluctantly did so despite having several unhappy and hungry people awaiting the pizza. I politely said prior to sending the pizza back that I had cleared up the issue prior to placing the order but again the manager was not understanding. 

All this aside the pizza is not very good and wouldn't dream of ordering without a dealsaver."}
{"text":"This is the best of the delivery pizza companies. Really good sauce, lots of toppings, incredible bread sticks, the dipping sauce is legal crack. Very comparable to Little Caesars pan pizza. The corners get caramelized and crunchy without greasiness. Really good pizza! 

Fast free delivery too."}
{"text":"Was looking for good pizza delivery. Jet's was that and more and the greek salad was very good too."}
{"text":"I'm new to the city and am so glad that I found my go to pizza place already!! So far I've tried their Hawaiin pizza and Buffalo bbq pizza, both with turbo crust and they are just awesome!! They do delivery and catering as well. Once I did delivery and they were really quick."}
{"text":"it's hard to give this 5 stars.  very hard...almost damn near impossible especially since I HATE chain pizza.  I despise chain pizza.  I think chain pizza isn't worthy enough to give to your dog...chances are your cat wouldn't eat it anyways.  and....to top it off, this is placed in Dormont, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF PIZZA OASIS.  With Camps, Fiori's and Mineo's all in a 5 minute drive, why would you ever go here?  Why in the world would they build this here of all places?  These questions seem almost as impossible to answer as me giving Jet's 5 stars but...here we are.  This chain pizza is now the ONLY chain cut I will ever eat.  Their deep dish is totally out of this world.  It really is magical.  Their salads are meh....but you aren't really going here for a salad are you?  Treat yourself, make sure you get their deep dish.  Make sure you get corner cuts.  Make sure you add some topics and crust flavorings.  Make sure you try Jet's...I promise you that as skeptical as you are...as was I...you will be smiling like you just won the game, found a parking spot, hit the lottery, banged th......  you get it."}
{"text":"To me, the pizza is all about the crust.  And this crust reminded me of a pizza shop that I used to go to in the Northway Mall when I was much younger.  I simply adore this pizza.  I don't get cravings for many things, but this is one place that I DO.  They deliver to my office on a regular basis as a lot of the employees here are fans too."}
{"text":"so i ordered for delivery even though i live 5 mins away (i am a lazy ass), they estimated that hey would arrive in 1 hour. kind of a long wait for pizza i thought, but they came within 20-30 mins. 

i ordered the eugene supreme and mild hot wings. the pizza was good but i realllyyyy liked the wings. i love buffalo wings and usually dont really like the wings from most pizza places but this place i like. 

it is kind of pricey for the pizza here but i think it is worth it."}
{"text":"I've ordered in their food a few times for work, the quality was rather inconsistent. It has been great but have had a few issues with it being burnt or made with too much sauce on individual instances. I've also seen their delivery drivers driving recklessly on several occasions, passing cars in the opposing lanes going 50 mph in front of a park."}
{"text":"Wife and I both got sick over their pizza.  It didn't taste right.  I did like the peppers they use.  But that's the only nice thing I have to say."}
{"text":"Our go to on a weekly basis. I call in my regular order, its done right and done quick every time! Only thing I wish is that they had an extra large in the thin crust. I like cold pizza for lunch the next day. Thank you Jets for getting it right every time."}
{"text":"A welcome change from the typical pizza chains, Jet's has quickly become the go-to pizza place at my house. We've had their pizza several times now and have never been disappointed. 

I love that you can get two small pizzas with different toppings on each. And even though they are small pizzas because the slices are so thick they are very filling. 1-2 pieces is enough for a meal.

They have really good wings too. Their boneless honey BBQ are really tasty and the chicken is tender and juicy. Dip 'em in Jet's ranch dressing and yummmmm....

 If you're looking for an alternative to your typical big pizza, Jet's is it."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Pizza tasted like any other fast food pizza with mediocre ingredients.  It's on par with pizza hut, papa johns, and dominoes.  Certainly not better.  Had I seen the menu prior to calling, I probably would've figured that out based on things like \"free flavor crust\" and \"boneless wings.\"  Sadly, I just called in the order not having read a menu.  If you like fast food pizza with frozen sausage nuggets and canned mushrooms... this is definitely gonna be your jam."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place!!

I ordered a chicken parmesan sub and had it delivered. The online ordering process is really easy.  My sub was delicious and delivered quick!! I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with their deep dish pizza and they are now my go-to on those nights when I don't feel like cooking! I even order their pizza for my store and everyone is always excited when Jets is coming! Consistently amazing and everyone I've dealt with has been super friendly. Makes the experience that much better when customer service is great all the way down to the delivery driver. Be sure to get their Turbo crust...it's a delicious blend of seasonings that puts the pizza over the top amazing! You won't be sorry giving these guys a try!

Update 4-28-17 Placed a catering order and a personal order tonight. The manager Matt is so friendly and the staff is still top notch. My food tonight was again nothing short of excellent!"}
{"text":"Lots of options to make a pizza just how you like it. Tried deep dish and thin crust, both well done with Turbo Crust. Very happy with both."}
{"text":"We recently started eating here. We been ordering pizzas a few times now. I would recommend giving their pizzas a try. Mix it up. So far its been hard for me to break away from the mushroom and cheese. I enjoy that flavor combination at Jets than the other places that offer cheese and mushroom. However I was not a fan of the wings. But I still ate them."}
{"text":"Jets pizza is very good. I like the thin crust pizza best. It is cut up in small squares and very good. I also like the jets bread. Delivery is always quick and my pizza is always hot when it gets to my house."}
{"text":"Just had my first Jet's Pizza experience because of fellow Yelpers. And once again, I'm glad I listened. We got a large cheese 8 corner pizza for just $10. Had two slices and I'm stuffed! Very good. The crust really does taste like the old Pizza Hut crust. A little too greasy but I was told, \"duh, It's pizza!\" Good taste. Great price. A little sad they don't deliver to my house it is was worth the pick up."}
{"text":"5 Star all day. Quick online ordering, coupons, hot delicious Detroit style pizza! I wish they were closer to Macedonia as I despise the drive on route 8. I love the square style pizza and the sauce. I recommend the turbo crust as it's super delicious. Prices are good and food has always been ready on time."}
{"text":"We are hooked on this pizza now. It's the crunchy sides.... I can't explain but you will freakin love it! Just try it. Get the 8 corner pan deal. Omygawsh!"}
{"text":"Went to this place several times when first opened. Good pizza and good service. The last two times was poor. Went yesterday (10/24) Called in a carry out. Rep stated 15-20 mins. Arrived---no pizza stated 5 more mins,-- no problem. I waited and waited and waited and waited. 45 mins later it was ready with No apologize, nothing. I asked several times how much longer, each time 5 mins. End result: poor customer service, pizzas were wrong when I got home But they were good. It was apparent by looking thru the glass of the pizza making process several new people were working but not trained well. Would not suggest this place considering there is about a dozen pizza joints within 2 miles. But this would be a good location to open a real pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza one evening and was told it would be ready in 25 mins, when we arrived the girl said it wasnt ready and to give them a few mins well 15 mins later the girl  failed to tell us it was in the warmer!!! Really after getting there before the 25 mins and still having to wait and then the employees not knowing what they are doing i was out done.  I told to the manger who finally gave me a 6.00 credit (by the time we arrived home the pizza was hard and lukewarm) He gave me a hard time and i dont appreciate  that as we are paying customers and dont forget without customers you dont get a check!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHen I went to use to credit some idiot told me that I couldnt  get the 7.99 pizza with a credit so he charged me 10.00 what kind of manager does this, you act like its coming out your pocket!!!   I will not buy your pizza and I am calling the health dept because they handle money, dont wash their hands and go make pizza!!!  Really dont wanna mess with me.
Shelah"}
{"text":"No more bad Pizza for me. Just like back home. Loved every bite. Will be going a lot. Everyone needs to try this amazing pizza that is crispy and succulent dripping with flavor. Hurry up and order some you will be very happy. Get both the Detroit Style Square and the NY Style"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! The quality of ingredients and dough are top notch. Definitely give this unique pizza a try. My favorite is the bbq chicken pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza great service!  Check out website for coupons before ordering.  (Fast delivery too!)"}
{"text":"As I may have mentioned before, I am forever on a quest here in Charlotte for a great pizza pie.  Knowing that Jet's has a deep dish pizza, I was quite excited to try it (especially since I had a Groupon to do so cheaply).  However, Jet's wasn't quite my cup of tea, so I will continue my quest.

My partner and I decided to try the Jet 10 pizza in deep dish and the Jet's Bread.  The bread used the same dough as the deep dish pizza, I am relatively certain.  However, the bread just didn't have enough garlic on it for my taste, so it was mostly just dough and cheese.  I really did not care for the marinara sauce there at all, as it was a very sweet marinara.  I am not at all a fan of sweet marinara sauces, so if you like them on the sweet side, this one is probably pretty good.  The bread itself was mildly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, so it had a good texture.  The portion size on the bread was pretty generous for the money, so that was good.

Not very often do you find places that have a square deep dish pizza.  You can't really see the outside crust, as the toppings go all the way out to the corners.  I was pretty excited about that.  I liked the variety of toppings on the Jet 10.  However, Jet's suffers from the same downfall of pizza chain deep dish in that it was mostly dough and easy on the toppings.  Again, their pizza sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, but if you like the sweet sauce at Pizza Hut (think big New Yorker or the stuffed crust), you will probably love the sauce.  I know that you can normally pick a flavor for the crust, but my impression was that you could not get that on the deep dish.  I am honestly not sure about that.

Now, dining in here is pretty great, I will say.  Our bread sticks came out in about 10 minutes, and they served them on a metal platter on a stand.  It was all very nice looking.  Our pizza came about 5 minutes later, also on a platter and stand.  The dining area was clean and not terribly cluttered at this location.  The employees were friendly and quick.

If you like a sweeter sauce on your pizza, I am guessing that you might appreciate this place a little more than I did.  Our pizza was hot and fresh, but very mediocre otherwise.  However, I am still holding out for a more perfect pizza place in the Queen City."}
{"text":"For Champaign IL and Urbana IL restaurants. 
 Great pizza; if you get the correct order. 
Delivery; The drivers in our area are good, yet if the order is wrong it don't matter how long you have to wait (1.5 hour for a 7 block drive from restaurant adding in cook time of 20-30mins). 
 My advice, go to the restaurant and order, that way you can look into the pizza box and make sure your order is correct.  
 If you have to have it delivered, while the drive is still with you, open the box(es) and check your order. 
 Good luck. It will be a great pizza as long it is your pizza."}
{"text":"America - I'm telling y'all that for a chain pizza joint, this is hands down some of the best Detroit style deep dish pie around.  And now, it's in Texas, Colorado and of course, here in Arizona. WHEN THE HELL IS IT COMING TO NEW FRIGG'EN NEW MEXICO???

Talked with the owner (who's an ex-Michigander) so he knows he Pie well. All fresh ingredients and made to order - so unlike all that other crap out there.  

I'm still a hand-tossed guy first (I know what you're thinking...we're talking Pie now) but for authentic Detroit style deeep dish - this is the bomb. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  I have heard so much good stuff about the Avon one that when this one opened up near my parents we HAD to give it a go!  Tried a few different kinds and they are OK.  A tad thicker crust than what I like.  Coupons they send aren't exactly the best but a few bucks is a few bucks.  Better than other options in the area so when I taking a break from the swimming pool I will try again.  They don't even seem to mind when I come in wearing my gold speedo and snorkel...akward, but business is business..."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of deep dish pizza but Jet's eight corner is one I like.
Good crust not too greasy and good quality cheese.
Their salads are great,if they upgraded their dressings they would be awesome.
For a chain they do a great job,the Westlake location has an eager to please staff."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! It has a crispy crust and is a thick crust pizza. I'm glad I ordered from this place, it's not the closet pizza place so I don't get it all the time but it's our favorite!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and I was excited to try this place.  Went with 8 corners pizza, bbq chicken pizza and breadsticks.   Everything was very good and the price was decent.  The breadsticks were super good.  The pizza?  The crust was incredible and I would highly recommend going with the 8 corner one."}
{"text":"Jets pizza became one of my favorite places as soon as they opened a location near me. I ordered a pizza online a couple months ago at 8:30 pm..never came no answer when i called the whole night, the money was already taken out of my account at this  point and it was 10:30pm and we were all very hungry considering how long we had alreadt been waiting. Pizza never came. Next day..no one ever called..i even the corporate office with no response. Anyways i ended up calling two days later because the money was taken out of my account, the manager justin was very nice he said they had there christmas that night and forgot to turn off the online ordering. I was ok with this because i myself work in the service industry and i realize things just happen sometimes. He refunded my money and said that i would get half off my next order because of the problem. A few weeks from then i try to order again, i mentioned the half off and the guy on the phone quicky said \" we dont have any of that on file did u still want your pizza?!\" I just hung up because instead of trying to find the error he just asked if i still wanted it..very rude in my book. Anyways, had someone call back and leave a voicemail an hour later saying \" im so sorrt i talked to justin, this isnt my store so i didnt know and your next whole order is on us\". After being very hesitant about calling back i finally did it 3 weeks later.. Sure enough they cant find the discount and dont know who justin is. If they were anything but rude on the phone i would have considered paying full price for my order, even after everything. This place really needs to get it together. Its super unfortunate because this place does have awesome food but dealing with rude people will quickly make anyone think twice about ordering there. I did contact corporate office twice now with no response.  I would love to have jets pizza again but if this issue never gets resolved i will never go back."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix from Michigan and like many other reviews before me, you know it makes me a happy Michigander to know I can have my Detroit-style deep dish so far from home. Delicious with buttery crunch! Yum! My favorite!"}
{"text":"As far as chain pizza will allow me to go. I must say its pretty damn good. Every time I have been to this particular jets pizza, the young men that serve me here always give me excellent service. 

Do me a favor and get the deep dish. You won't regret it. Or if you aren't feeling pizza, get the grilled chicken sub sandwich. With the Italian dressing... YUM!"}
{"text":"I love getting this pizza at the Columbus locations so I was really happy to find it in Cleveland as well. Just ordered a large with turbo crust and they let us do a split, half pepperoni and half cheese only along with an order of breadsticks. Used a coupon from the paper and after the delivery fee it was $18 and some change. Yeah there is a delivery fee but what can you do. 

The order showed up fairly quick. I'd say about 35 minutes. It was correct and right out of the oven. Everything tastes great with no problems at all.  Glad to know I can grab Jet's when I'm up this way now.

If you like spicy then try the Cajun crust. There is also an option to add feta cheese for and extra charge which I found to be very good!  I've ordered salad and the garlic knots before too and both were great. The only thing I have not been a fan of is their wings. They just seem like something you could buy frozen and heat up. I'd pass on the wings and order
 a specialty chicken pizza if you are in the mood for chicken."}
{"text":"Oh, how I've missed you, Jet's! This was our go-to pizza when we lived in the Detroit area, so when we moved to AZ last summer, we were disappointed that all we could find in the area were soggy NY style pizzas (for the most part). Even the decent pizza places we tried just didn't hit the spot like Jet's does. I only wish that you were closer to home, because we'd be there every week. Please come to the West Valley!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious!! Always great service. The Hawaiian pizza is fantastic. The crust was baked in a rectangle and was crispy to perfection. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had. Great service every time, too. The 8-corner pizza has an amazing, flavorful crust. I took 3 friends visiting out of state and they agreed on the bet pizza they've ever had. If you haven't tried this and you're reading this, call them right meow and order the 8-corner with your favorite toppings. 

The salads are what you might expect from a pizza joint - not the best. But you didn't come here to eat salad."}
{"text":"I wish my stomach was bigger so that I could eat more. The deep dish deluxe pizza and cheesy bread brought me back to life.  I embraced every bite and the price was cheap. It reminded me of my favorite pizza place in SF. You can also get pizza by the slice. Great fast service and quality pizza. Take me back please!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and stop ordering Papa John's and Domino's. Jets is the best \"crappy\" pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love Jets pizza.  Im surprised to see such poor reviews below. My experience has always been good. I love the turbo crust both round and square pizzas from here. I think the jetzees are amazing and very different from other subs since the bread is pizza crust."}
{"text":"As a little fat kid, I love, love, LOVED Little Caesar's pizza.  Not sure why, but getting a square pizza always seemed to make it taste better.  (I had a younger cousin who refused to eat anything but square pizza...the family had to get creative sometimes to turn those triangles into squares)

Jet's Pizza reminds me of Old Skool Little Caesar's - not exactly awesome, but square, greasy, and pretty tasty.  Their square pizzas are of the deep dish variety.  You can get an extra flavor on your crust, but I'm not sure that's needed.  We've ordered from Jet's a few times, and to be honest, I forgot that we'd ordered a flavored crust the one time because the flavor (garlic) was so subtle.  They also offer traditional pizza or thin crust, but I haven't tried those.  

My boyfriend tells me their boneless wings are \"just ok\" and I think their bread sticks are kind of boring, but...this is a chain, after all.  I can't expect everything to be a WIN.

Since this is the new pizza game in town, they tend to be pretty busy.  Plan ahead if you want takeout or delivery because they wait can be longer than what you might expect at other pizza chains in the area."}
{"text":"Have had this pizza numerous times and when I'm not in the mood for NY style pizza this is the place to go. Crust is awesome pizza is just great! Can't wait for the next time."}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza. We ordered a hand tossed cheese and a pepperoni pizza with the turbo crust and the crust is the cherry on top. Very good pizza. Also tried the cinnamon sticks and those were delicious as well. Will come back. Used the Groupon to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I Love Jet's!! I had a order placed with another company who completely bailed last minute. The person taking my call at Jet's  (don't remember her name but she was amazing!) was very sympathetic and guaranteed my order would get there on time, made great suggestions for my large order, and even added on a coupon to guarantee I was a happy customer. I will only order from Jet's from now on..you guys are the best!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Jets pizza is great, but the staff here were very rude and couldn't handle a busy night. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Just got another pizza from Jets Lyndhurst location and again very good.  Chicken Parm Pizza with Turbo crust, love it. And ask for the dipping sauce and they'll give to you free."}
{"text":"$18 + tip for delivery of an ok 14\" (large) pizza that took 75 minutes to get.  Pizza was hot but not at all impressive. Very generic.  Would not pay this much for this quality pizza again."}
{"text":"PROS: Tasty pizza, good for takeout
CONS: Pricier than expected

When you want a hearty, crispy, thick-crust pizza and simple toppings instead of the fancy Italian style pizze, Jet's won't disappoint. One large pizza can feed multiple people. The crust is carb heavy, but in a good way! Prices are higher than expected but the quality and taste does make up for it."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find out Jet's was opening in AZ!  I may be biased, but I think they have one of the best pizzas in town! Try the deep dish with turbo crust, and don't forget the Jet Bread, OMG! Love this Detroit based pizza!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Deep Dish pizza in Scottsdale! I was never a fan of Deep Dish pizza, but they've made a believer out of me! The crust is SO GOOD everyone wants the corners. So, they have 4 corner or 8 corner pizza on their menu as options I guess to keep the peace at your house so that there isn't fighting for the corners. Whichever toppings you decide on, the Deep Dish 4 or 8 corner with the turbo crust is a must!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing Jet's advertisements attached to my door a lot lately and with a review today on Yelp, I decided this was going to be dinner.

I ordered my pizza online and not only do they have pizza but they have salads and sandwiches  too.  So my order consisted of a pizza with pepperoni and red onions and a greek salad. 

First the salad.  It appears to be made when you order because the website said it came with beets and i didn't want to be beeted so I unchecked that option and voila, there were no beets on my salad.  The olives, maters, onions and feta were all fresh.  The dressing was decent for a pizza place.

The pizza is great for a takeout/delivery place.  It may replace my orders to Papa Johns.  They are definitely closer to me anyway.  The dough is amazingly light and reminds me of the dough at a place back home (Victor Emmanuels in Reading, PA)  but it's not there yet.  The cheese wss gooey and flavorful.  The sauce is what needs improvement.  It really lacked flavor.  And the onions were diced onions that just seemed to be spread in the middle of the pizza.  

But overall this is a good pizza.  Definitely worth ordering again."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp and thought let's try it. We are vacation and stayed in hotel that delivered here.
Pizza was good but not very flavor able. We got round pizzas so maybe that is why.  We ordered turbo crust and we did not get it upon delivery. Salad was good size and good value.
The cinnamon sticks were not very good but I bet better if you at hot not after eating dinner.
Delivery was quick and there was delivery fee which was not told to us at phone order. Think they should disclose that when ordering.
Overall, pretty good for delivery pizza and relaxing night at hotel."}
{"text":"Jets is the best pizza hands down. This particular location has the best of both worlds. They deliver and have carry out, but they also feature a beautiful dining room. Very clean, well run establishment."}
{"text":"The square pizza is by far my favorite. The perfect crust with extra cheese and sauce. Will order again!"}
{"text":"We ordered 100 pizza's from Jet's and we were very pleased with the service and the quality of the pizza's. We preordered a week in advance. The staff at this location was super friendly and accommodating. We ordered 50 cheese and 50 pepperoni 4 corner pizza boxes. Everything was delivered right on time and the pizza's were super hot/fresh. Everyone loved the pizza! I will definitely order from Jet's again. I can't wait till they open more locations throughout the valley!"}
{"text":"Moved here recently from Chicago but originally from NC.  Never had Jets before but had some friends mention it and then received a Groupon.  We've come back a ton since and honestly I think its because nothing else around offers anything even with the name deep dish in it.  Its insanely cheap for what you get and the ranch has to have some sort of drug in it because its addicting."}
{"text":"This pizza is unexpectedly tantalizing is what my husband called it!!  The people that work there are super nice and very friendly.  Their deep dish pizza is out of this world amazing!  It's very gourmet and very affordable!  Our new favorite pizza place for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Twice I have attempted to use the coupons this outfit prints, yet there is always some conundrum that prevents me from using them, and I end up ordering Dominoes because of it.  The first time, I was told that the coupon that I was trying to redeem was one that wasn't accepted by their store but I could call the one outside of my delivery area and they could help.  Hello?  I wanted delivery, but more to the point, why not accept the coupon and forge a  relationship?  I guess that is too much of a stretch for the people working at 8700 Pineville-Matthews Road, 28226.  I just called back today to order a $17.49 8 corner crust large Jet 10 pizza, which appeared to be pictured on the coupon and I was told the 8 corner option was not offered for this although you certainly couldn't tell that wasn't what the pic on the coupon suggested.  Their pizza is good, but pizzas don't cost $25 in 2015.  At least the ones I buy don't.  There are way too many other more affordable choices in the chain pizza category, IMHO.  Most even accept the coupons they print."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this store and the employees.  I expressed a little dissatisfaction that a jet 10 was cost prohibitive for lunch and the very nice store person I was speaking to handed me a coupon for a free small,  apologized for my inconvenience and suggested on my next visit I could just pay to add the toppings to it.  I thought this was a very nice gesture and did make me want to come back again.  I ordered the two slices and a drink for $5 and it was hot,  fresh and tasted like the guilty pleasure it is.  Very impressed with this store and their help and I will be back many times beyond this kind gesture which is often lacking in today's faster food options.   A+"}
{"text":"Today while trying to figure out what to get for lunch on a tight budget, a co-worker suggested I try jet's Pizza. For $6.00 they have a lunch special of two thick crust slices and a pop. I got the sausage and a piece of cheese. Not only did the slices come out hot and very tasty, I only waited maybe 2 minutes for my order to be done. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't come here as often as I used to because all the crazy coupons have dried up.  I am also eating healthier and that makes this a poor fit.  The flavor remains something I crave."}
{"text":"I don't have too many quick, good pizza options for delivery/take out in my neighborhood... so when Jet's opened, I was super excited! My favorite is the 8 corner pepperoni pizza with their \"turbo\" crust. Pair that with a nice beer at home, and I'm a happy camper! I've tried their round pizzas, and am not quite as happy with those, just my preference though(round was still good, deep dish 8 corner is just my fav!). If you haven't yet, give them a shot. It's a tasty alternative to all the Pizza Huts and Little Caesar's they have all over south Chandler/Gilbert."}
{"text":"I am a pizza SNOB.... this pizza was absolutely AMAZING!!!!!   I will absolutely order from there the next time I'm in town! Service was very efficient too!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large, all edge pizza and then requested a heart shape (for valentine's day, of course) and they delivered two medium perfect all-edge heart pizzas!!! I'm so happy and so impressed, thank you for making our office lunch perfect for Valentine's Day! Also, that GARLIC CRUST THOUGH"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing !! Total deep dish yumminess! So glad we found this little gem of a pizza place here in Chandler ! The staff is also super friendly and accommodating. We had the aloha Barbeque chicken so good !! Can't wait to try other signature pizzas they have !!"}
{"text":"First time having Jets Pizza and I was more than pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 8 Corners with pepperoni with butter crust. Superb! Best crust I have ever had. Ever. I am definitely ordering again. I instagrammed the pic of my pizza and the official @jetspizza account liked and commented. Kind of a neat little detail. I want to try the buffalo chicken pizza. It seems like that's everyone's favorite. I'm looking forward to my next pizza already !"}
{"text":"Just as good as the one on 21 mile and Garfield. I'm so glad to have a taste of home a car ride away."}
{"text":"Jets is the only chain pizza I eat because square pizza is the only pizza. I pickup pizza from here all the time but today I ordered delivery. My pizza was here in 30 minutes! Just as hot and as fast as if I'd picked it up."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Some have likened it to  lil'Caesar's...nope. Not an chance. This is sooooo much better and a real-deal Detroit pizza establishment/institution. Great menu options, fair prices and always friendly service. We love you Jets! Y'all rock!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good - the 8 corner pizza is a great value and it tastes very good, and the prices are decent.

Their delivery times are really off however.  The last two times we ordered through their web site, the pizza was 1 hour and 45 minutes past the promised delivery times, respectively, which were already 45 minutes to begin with.  This is too long to wait, especially when delivery is not free ($2 charge).  My advise is to pick up from the store, or order someplace else if you want to eat at a reasonable time."}
{"text":"IMHO, the had-tossed pizza looked and tasted like a cheap store bought brand. I only gave them two stars because they undercharged me and the cinnamon sticks tasted good, like CiCi's sticks. This is a pick-up/delivery place only. No seating is available."}
{"text":"If you like Little Ceasars $5 pizza  then you will love this over priced $11 pizza.  I am sure all the great reviews came from friends and family!  Good luck. Hope you did not sign a long lease."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. Their cheesy logo of an Italian guy flying with a jetpack didn't give me high expectations. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that the pizza was actually very good. This is a good case of \"don't judge a book by it's cover\". I always keep it simple and order the lunch special. Can't beat the deal - currently it's $5 for 2 slices of Sicilian pizza and a fountain drink. Cheaper than eating fast food."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan!

I placed the order... drove there and it was already ready.  Very specific order and they didn't mess up anything!  Perfectly baked.  For the money, you really can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I didn't know how this experience would turn out during a very lengthy confusing ordering process on my lunch break. After mulling over the lunch menu and making a decision, I started to place my order and that really confused the guy taking my order. I am assuming he is new just based on his confusion and how long it took to finalize the order.

It ended up being just over ten dollars for half of a Jetzee sandwich and a personal salad. Wow, the salad could definitely feed \"the starving Pygmies down there in New Guinea! Amen! - I don't care who you are, that's funny right there.\" The sandwich was pretty tasty but the bread was greasy just like the pizza normally is..

There is a chance I will be back."}
{"text":"Perusing the locations available on the Jet's web site, it looks like many of them do not offer the option to dine in, but this location does give you that choice. In a few days or weeks or months it may be even nicer when they finish the construction in the area and you have a better view of the nearby surroundings, but in the meantime, there are a handful of tables were you can pull up a chair and wait out a few minutes while your pie is prepared.

The selections are not quite those typical choices you'll find in the Queen City. New York-style (or Near-New York-style, perhaps) abound, but here at Jet's, the specialty is definitely deep dish. Not Chicago deep dish, but a square-crust behemoth that can be had with any of several flavors for NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE - as Ben has mentioned, try the turbo (butter, garlic and romano).

Others have mentioned a less than crispy crust, so I don't know if it's the turbo or this pie just lucked out, but the crispy crust worked well. There are lots of options if you want to trick it out, there are salads if you are not in the mood for a pizza, and there are even sandwiches and wings if you want something else entirely. Definitely worth a few stops for your dining pleasure."}
{"text":"We love Jet's so much, especially their thin crust pizzas... Which is strange because everyone else that we have talked to about this raves about their deep dish pizzas, which we didn't quite like. 
We specifically get the thin garlic crust with onions, green peppers and pepperoni. It's so full of flavor, I always end up eating even after I'm full, and NEVER regretting it. This location is really convenient and clean and they always have your order ready in very reasonable time. It's always a happy day when we get Jet's."}
{"text":"I usually just get a to go order from here. You can get two slices of pizza and a drink for $5. Love their pizza and their pizza sauce."}
{"text":"We really like Jet's pizza. It's not a sit down, eat in place so don't arrive looking for a place to dine. That's not it. But if you want to take your food with you, you'll be pleased with it. The pizza is good and they'll make it however you want it, of course.  The wings are good. The salads are good. We've not had anything that we didn't enjoy.  The service is friendly and we've always found the employees to be efficient as well as friendly. No complaints regarding Jet's. I'm glad they are here as it's a great option for those 'need a quick option' moments."}
{"text":"Horrible. Placed an order online, called an hour after to find where it was. Was told it was not received, I told them just forget it. Got in my car and left, as I drove out guess who was coming down the street, and stopped at my house? You guessed it Jets. The order was wrong, food was cold, and was told basically hey we are short staffed deal with it. 

I went on their corp website sent a request for a call and left my feedback. To this day more than 3 months later they have never called! It's not hard to pick up a phone as an owner and call someone and make things right."}
{"text":"Jets pizza is absolutely delicious!
Fresh toppings, buttery crust and delicious flavor. They offer to go light on sauce and their sauce tastes just right. Service is wonderful and they are so nice. Definitely my go to place for pizza delivery. We.always get the 4 corner or the 8 corner!"}
{"text":"Looks like I spoke way too soon with my initial review...even back then the service had ranged from good to mediocre, but it's gotten worse to the point where I won't order from them anymore after tonight. There have been occasions where I've ordered food to-go and showed up only to find that they hadn't even started to make the food. I'd overlooked that, and despite the fact that it's a chain, I really liked the 8-corner pizza and the boneless wings. That said, the last two times I ordered they didn't bring the ranch I ordered which kind of ruins the wings (and on another note, who charges extra for ranch with wings?!?) The first time it happened the young kid delivering the pizza felt bad and went back to get me one, granted by the time he got back an hour later I was already done eating, but at least he tried. The old white creep that delivered my food tonight tried to tell me that they didn't charge me for it (FALSE), and when I called his bluff he just blamed it on someone else and left without offering to make things right. He was super rude and ultimately the final straw that changed my original 5-star review to a one star, and cost this location my business."}
{"text":"My favorite all-time pizza has been from Ledo's Pizza.  It isn't that its great pizza but its what I grew up with.  While I've had other places, nothing else has ever left me wanting pizza more than Ledo's.  Well, Ledo's has been replaced by Jet's Pizza.  

Wanting something new, I wandered into Jets two weeks ago and placed an order for a 8 slice pizza with sausage, green peppers, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  It's takeout only so I waited, watched sports center played on my phone until my order was ready.  When the guy behind the counter handed me my order, I was shocked by the sheer weight of the pizza.  

I took it back to my office where my colleagues tracked me down as soon as they saw the box \"JET'S PIZZA!!! CAN I HAVE SOME?!?\"  They knew what I was yet to discover.  

The dough is amazing.  It crisps on the bottom and sides forming the perfect base for a rich tomato sauce, the gooiest mozzarella you'll find anywhere.  If there was a pizza heaven, I was there at first bite.  Really puts those round discs of trash into perspective.  I only had two slices before my colleagues at the entire pizza.  

Went back on Friday for the same order, snuck in the side door to my office and enjoyed Jets again.  Very Very Very good.  This time, I had leftovers so I came home to see what it would taste like reheated.  

385 in the oven for 11 minutes and its nearly as good as when first fresh.  That's awesome!

I'm an evangelist of Jets!"}
{"text":"JETS JETS JETS Pizza definitely put a smile on my face and my belly. 

Have heard great things about this place and their deep dish style pizzas.  I'm more of a thin crust fan myself and while they also do serve thin crust here (I see you thin crust for next time). I decided to order a deep dish and give that a go. 

They have an Apple App and don't know about the rest of you, but I love ordering through my phone and not having to speak to someone while I'm busy at work or after a long day. Score for convenience Jets!! The app was fairly simple to order but compared to say the Corporate chains out there the app could use a bit work. Which I'm sure time will fix.  

Ordered my pizza (JETS FAVORITE- pepperoni deep dish) and promptly received an email with my pick up time. You can choose what seems like 8 different crust choices. And while I heard turbo crust is best I decided on the butter crust since my arteries obviously wouldn't be clogged enough with a deep dish pizza.

I walked in and immediately wish the smell came in candle form.  I also realized they serve by the slice. Hells yeah!! Got my 8\" square deep dish and on my way.  

Opened that bad boy once I got home and.......Lets just say I got pizza wasted, it was glorious.  Holy Moly Pizza Pepperoni... The crust was out of bounds and I could have just eaten that. The cheese was perfect and not too salty. The sauce did seem a tad sweet for my liking but no deal breaker by any means. 

Yep, safe to say JETS PIZZA will be my stop for quick pizza over Papas or Barros.  Glad I tried the deep dish and not sure I could eat that every time, but New York style thin crust. Oh yes you are my next on my hit lis tand you don't even know it yet."}
{"text":"Being from Michigan I love me some Jets Pizza. 

If you decide to get pizza from here don't waste your time with the round pizza. Get the deep dish Detroit style pizza. Yes, Detroit style pizza is a real thing. Look it up.... 

Here is my recommended order:

8 corner pizza with bold pepperoni and bacon if you are into that kind of thing..AND Ask for Turbo Crust!!!!!!!! Little secret not many people know about. It is a butter cheese topping they put on the edges of the pizza!!! 

My mouth is watering... I wish I lived on the west side...."}
{"text":"Forget that little Roman guy!  For your square pizza needs, I gotta go with Jet's Pizza.  They always have good coupons, so snag one for a deal.  We split a small specialty pizza (6 square slices) and a drink for around $10.  I guess they're known for the square ones, so give it a try.

This location is also nice that it's in a walk-able part of town near the downtown Matthews area."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in the Huntersville area. Real good food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time Saturday night. We got the extra large deep dish chicken alfredo and I have to say this pizza is awesome. Delivery was quick and the driver was super friendly. He had a Navy hat on but I did not get his name. We have eaten at every pizza joint in the area and this place is the best."}
{"text":"First time ordering. Online ordering was easy. It said give them 55 minutes but i was pleasantly surprised by the delivery in less than 30 minutes.  I found the price a bit much for the size that arrived. It was good. But i am not sure i would order again. The driver was very courteous."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my new home doesn't really have much in terms of pizza delivery. This Jet's location is sort of on my way back from work, however. By \"sort of\", I mean that when I have a pizza craving, not much will stop me.

The location is easy to find, with this seriously massive window print of PIZZA. There's really no mistaking what this place serves. The neighbors are little odd, though. I went inside to pick up my online order, and I wasn't greeted or looked at for a good 5 minutes. I realize you're busy, but shouting a hi or something isn't very hard, and it'd make a customer feel better about just standing there awkwardly.  The guy was nice enough, and everything was straightfoward.

The pizza was good, but the calzone (Jet's Boat) had dough that was way too thin. We're talking 1/8th dough, 1/2 cheese, and the rest was meat. Where's the tasty Turbo dough?

I have to say I like the Matthews location better, but when It comes to pizza on the cheaper side, Jet's is still much better than Papa Johns or Pizza Hut or Dominos, etc."}
{"text":"Jet's Pizza is pretty damned good! We've ordered from here a few times now. I think it's the cheese and whatever they do to the crust is really tasty! 
The calzone (Jet's Boat?) is probably one of the best I've ever had. I'm a sucker for good perfectly chewy crust, I think.
We've had the meat lovers and also some veggie combo pizza, along with Jet's Bread and the hot wings. Everything was good and worth getting again. The hot wings are a little tame and I wish they had sauce that wasn't Kraft packets, but hey.. still way way better than Pizza Hut.

Online ordering makes it a breeze and delivery is prompt. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"Well, as of today my epic search for true Chicago deep dish pizza continues, but Jet's does offer a tasty, um, deep-ish dish pizza!

I called Jet's a few days ago as a little yelpy birdy told me that they have deep dish pizza. This was confirmed by a nice Jet's employee and I therefore raced to their website to get a good look. Well, it is deep dish pizza, but it's not Chicago deep dish (buttery crust, piles of cheese, sauce on top). And that's ok...I tried Jet's deep dish anyway! Note - there is no seating in Jet's, it's delivery or carry out only. 

Hubs picked it up (but they deliver too) and it was pretty damn delicious. Thick 'za (1.5\" or so) topped with tasty, melty cheese and loads of fresh veggies. The deep dish wasn't too greasy IMO, but then again maybe the grease soaked into the buttery crust. I believe hubs paid $10.99 + one topping for a large (ten squares). While it wasn't ridiculously expensive the large isn't *that* large. I'll definitely order from Jet's again when I get a hankering for fluffy pizza. Mmm."}
{"text":"Really liked their pizza. Not too salty. Held together nicely. Nice toppings. Order online was easy. Guys were really nice. Signed us up for frequent buyer program. Next time get a free 2 liter. Not bad."}
{"text":"Pizza is good... Minnesota local vocab and cuisine. Help is not that friendly or helpful. Worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"Really cheap and good pizza. Esp their cheese stick. I can eat that forever."}
{"text":"So excited to see Jet's in AZ! The deep dish pizza is fantastic! I ordered mine well done with extra sauce and pepperoni and garlic crust. It was amazing. By far the best fast food pizza in AZ. The staff were also very friendly. I'd definitely recommend this place over Pizza Hut, Dominos and Papa Johns. I think the salads are pretty decent here too."}
{"text":"I love Jet's Pizza.  They do fair weekly deals on their pizzas and it always tastes super good, comes out fresh and hot.  What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"I called in my order at 8:40. I asked how long the wait time was for delivery. I was told it would 30-45 minutes, possibly even faster. It is now 9:30. Still no pizza. 

Fast forward to 9:40. Delivery guy calls from the gate because he can't get in. Give him the code and he finally gets in. It's probably 1,000 feet from the gate to our door. It took an additional 12 MINUTES for him to get to our door. He was a little off putting. Finally opened pizza box and wings at 9:55.

The food was cold. Had I known it was going to take so long I wouldn't have ordered from there."}
{"text":"Ordered a New York style pepperoni pizza, boneless wings and breadsticks.   Delivery man was wonderful and the food was very good.   Will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Hey I'm from Chicago and I know good pizza and I know bad pizza. This pizza and some of the best Sicilian style pizza in Arizona. I highly recommend this place! I ordered the pizza with extra sauce and well done based on a few reviews. I like my pizza crispy and with Sauce that I can find and enjoy that's exactly how this Pizza came out. If you like the crunchy cheesy flavor for Pizza that is thick like Sicilian style then you won't be disappointed. Give this place a try I think you'll be surprised I was."}
{"text":"Have ordered  from here twice now. Average  pizza at best. But way to overpriced for what you get. 6 slices of pepperoni new York style. $20. Not including tip. Won't order again"}
{"text":"Jet's is my favorite pizza EVER!!  I moved to AZ from Nashville 5 years ago, and we had Jet's there.  I was so disappointed not to have it here, and I have been anxiously awaiting its Phoenix opening since I heard about it last year!  I got it last weekend, and it is just as wonderful as I remembered!  You have to get the 8 corner \"Detroit style\" pizza.  That's what they're known for.  But know that it is ridiculously filling, so usually one pizza is enough for 3 or maybe even 4 people.  I think they're still working out some kinks of opening a new store, but I'm sure they'll be over those growing pains quickly.  I am so excited to have Jet's here, just wish I were in the delivery zone!  Oh, and their ranch dressing is perfect, so, if you love to dip pizza in ranch dressing, you're in luck!"}
{"text":"This place rocks and I never eat pizza from a chain. Their thin crust veggie pizza is the closest thing I have found to real pizza in the Charlotte area. My husband raves about the deep dish pizza with \"turbo\" crust but I prefer the thin crust pizza because you get more of the toppings in each bite. Ordering is a snap, they have good specials and delivery is always prompt/friendly. I knocked off one star because at times, they are frugal with the cheese/toppings and the cheesy bread is tasteless. As for their pizza and salads- top notch; in our rotation when we need our monthly pizza fix!"}
{"text":"I certainly don't mind the floppy, thin-crust-style NY pizza. But nothing beats a great deep dish, and Jet's has some GREAT deep dish pizza. Very fresh, vibrant flavors and incredible prices. The turbo stick are good too - with varieties in cheese, cheese and bacon, and cheese and pepperoni.  The salads are pretty good, too. I've not yet tried their sandwiches, but am eager to - the delicious thick crust pizza dough serves in place of bread.  Best part - their lunch combos. Killer food for $5.

Now, I'm feeling some confusion over whether or not they deliver to the area (I see the cars, but the employees say they don't).  Hopefully that gets resolved soon.

Very glad to see Jet's in town!"}
{"text":"Best new Pizza in Westlake.  

Keep in mind Pizza tastes change like the seasons, but this season, Jet's is good stuff.

LOVE the spices you can put on the crust (FREE), and the cheese is amazing.  You're not going to pick up a $5 pizza here, but it's well worth the price."}
{"text":"Yummy goodness!  Thanks Jets for opening up in Middleton!  It was definitely a staple from Detroit we need in WI."}
{"text":"I'm a jersey girl, missing my thin NY crust pizza. BUT... Jets has won me over. I've tried the chicken parm square pie and pepperoni and both were awesome. I've picked up and gotten delivery and both experiences were good. The crust is so good and buttery, the sauce and cheese are perfect, and the toppings are great. LOVE EM!"}
{"text":"Terrible first experience with Jet's. Took over an hour for one medium takeout after being quoted 20-25 minutes with no apologies whatsoever. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"\"J-E-T-S Jets Jets Jets!\" Place is so bomb. I must say that I have only had the deep dish pizza, but it is excellent! Always hot fresh and ready to go slices! The dudes who work here are super cool. Place is much much better than any chain pizza and quite frankly is better than a lot of mom and pop pizza places as well. I stop here on a weekly basis, 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in chandler!  We absolutely love this place.   Fast friendly delivery.   We order the large 8 piece butter crust pepperoni extra sauce extra cheese square pizza.   It's to die for!  Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in the Cleveland area by far! I love the sauce; it's so hearty. Order the large deep dish with sausage and pepperoni and you'll be amazed."}
{"text":"Jet's makes one hell of a pizza.  4 corners is a really good semi-deep dish ZA that is over and above the cheaper pizza chains out there.  I prefer Jets over Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominos, Little Caesars, Giorgios, etc.  Its top notch when it comes to rankings withing the budget pizza department but when compared to places like Geraci's, it falls a little.  I only wish that Jet's would open up shop here on the east side of Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Living in Michigan for 6+ years I had the luxury of living by a Jet's Pizza and eating it as often as one could handle; at least once per week for movie night, sometimes more.  So when I moved to Cleveland in 2008 I found out really quick that the closest Jet's was like 20 miles away, so the search for a new pizza place for me to grab and go was on.  

Fast forward to December 2011 and my search still continued.  I tried just about every local pizza joint in my area (delivery and pick-up) within a 5-10 min. drive and really couldn't find anything that could compare.  I do blame a lot of this on my biased love for Jet's but I also factually know that I am not the only one with this infatuation (wife, brother, brothers ex., many friends, and a couple bartenders I've got to talking to over the years).  Apparently we all have similar palates.

So, to get back on track, December 2011 I decided to do my monthly check on Jet's website to see if any stores are 'coming soon' and what do you know?  You guessed it!!!  Lyndhurst store coming soon!  F'N excited, really super duper excited if you catch my drift.  But immediately I started thinking that what if the pizza here tastes different then the one I used to get 6 hours away in Michigan.  I'd be devastated.   

Opened late December 2011 (during holiday break) and started my long, devoted relationship with the new Jet's just last night with a large deep dish pepperoni, $9.91 after online coupon, paid online, picked up right on time, brought home (10 minute drive), stuck in oven at 200F (wait for wife - 10 minutes), and busted out maybe 5 minutes after she arrived.  Obviously both of us are highly anticipating this pie since its been way too long since our last time.  Pizza came out still super cheesy, crisp edges, hot and delicious. Let me tell you that Jet's did not disappoint, not a bit, nor could I tell you that there was any difference in taste between the two locations.  Bravo Jets, we love you dearly!

Now for those who are thinking about hitting up Jet's in the near future you need to keep a few things in mind.  We love the deep dish which comes in small, large, and XL.  The 8 corner pizza is great too but a little more expensive.  The thin crust and flat are not recommended only because the deep dish is so much better.  The subs / boats are fantastic as are the breads.  I don't really remember the wings because 9 times out of 10 I only get pizza not to mention I have a completely separate wing craving and like to satisfy only one at a time.  

The parking lot is a little crammed.  The place was packed around 6:15pm on a Thursday as expected.  I live only 3.33 miles away and am out of the delivery radius, so don't be surprised if they don't deliver.  It will tell you once you order online and set up your address.   

If you can't tell by my review, I'm still pretty excited even the day after.  Probably because of the leftovers sitting in my fridge.  Enjoy fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I'm never really a fan of chain restaurants, but was looking to try a new pizza place and Jet's reviews intrigued me. The verdict is that this pizza is awesome. They have a couple different kinds, and I got the 4 Corner, which is square with square cuts and thick crust. Each piece has 2 crunchy sides with crispy cheese around the edges. The sauce isn't sweet, but certainly isn't spicy, which I loved.... It's like a better version of the Pizza Hut of my youth. 10/10 for quick delivery and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and wings from this place today.  BIG mistake.

I got a medium pepperoni and sausage pizza and an order of hot buffalo wings.  There was NOTHING good about any of it:

1.  Service - it took ONE HOUR for the flunkie to show up at my door.  I called them after 50 minutes, and the girl just said \"he's on the way, and that's all I can tell you\".  She initially told me 35-40 minutes.  Then, the flunkie called me, lost, from within my neighborhood.  If this were 1986 and there were no cell phones of GPS units, I would understand.  Not today, though.  We were NOT off to a good start.  
Oh, and I paid a $2.50 delivery charge for that hassle.

2.  Pizza - I am not convinced that they didn't just order a Domino's Pizza and put it in their own box.  It was IDENTICAL to Domino's, for the most part.  I think Domino's has better crust, though.  Plus, Jet's costs 1.5x more than Domino's.

3.  Wings - Awful.  Soggy.  They don't offer blue cheese, ranch, etc.  Enough said.

Any pizza place is a better alternative to Jet's.  I started regretting not ordering from Donato's the moment I hung up the phone from ordering it.  My regrets were valid.  Avoid this place - it sucks."}
{"text":"I feel like they definitely more so deserve a 3.5 star rating, but since I am not allowed to do so, the \"A-OK\" of the 3 star rating definitely matches my feelings more. 

I tried a hand tossed pizza with the signature turbo crust, .  The online ordering was definitely nice, and pickup was on time.  No waiting.  The prices are fair, and the food a good serving size.  OK.  all check.

The pizza itself was just OK on the whole.  The sauce was actually amazing, so huge kudos for the sauce, but the rest was lacking.  The cheese was on the blander side, and mostly added texture.  The crust was also average, and on the chewy side.  There is however a baking option for \"well-done\", so I might get that in the future over \"regular\".  The Turbo crust (the garlic, butter, and romano crust) was not anything special, and pales in comparison to Domino's pizza crust.  

All and all, I'm not blown away, and I have had better pizza in the area, but I would go again.  The sauce was definitely the high point and delicious, and I have to say the deliboats look good too and I would love to try one of them.  Definitely a good little pizza place, but not the best.  You won't be upset though!

P.S.  I also found out that there is no eat-in here, it's all pickup and delivery.  Just FYI."}
{"text":"Had the eight corner pizza and a salad last night. Being from the Bronx NY I had my reservations but let me tell you it was not bad at all. I think I found my new favorite pizza joint now that I live in Matthews now."}

{"text":"We had this in Ohio and we are so excited that it's here!!! We love the deep dish 8-corner pizza."}
{"text":"I have only eaten Jet's for lunch. Their 2 slices and a drink for $5 is a great value IMO.

They offer slices daily of pepperoni, sausage and a flavor of the day. Today they had Hawaiian as the slice of the day.

The pizza is thick and hearty and is mostly crust which has a nice crispy shell. I could always go for more cheese and toppings but you get your $5 worth when you go to Jets.

They have many more items on the menu so variety is there for those who want more than pizza."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Probably my favorite in the Brooklyn/Parma area. I'm a big cheese fan and it seemed like they have the thickest cheese around. Plus, flavored crusts never hurt anyone :)"}

Great food 
Great service 
What an establishment this is! 
Love jets!!!"}
{"text":"My first pizza night in college and Jet's was one of two places reccomended by my roomate, the other being Papa Del's for deep dish. We went with the former, as deep dish for me is a once-in-a-blue-moon occasion.  

We picked up a large thick crust pepperoni and a thin crust of cheese. Both pizzas were lacking sauce, and in my opinon were just OK. I would not order the thin crust again, it was far too thin and had hardly any sauce on it, meh....

The thick crust has potential, though. Nice almost fluffy consistency and good flavor, but you can still kind of tell that it was cheap pizza, almost along the lines of Pizza Hut/Domino's, which I actually do enjoy once in a while.

It's hard to please hardcore pizza traditionalists from Chicago who frequent Aurelio's, Palermo's, etc. However, for the price of Jet's you really can't beat it and I'm sure I'll be ordering again next time I need some budget pizza."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places around!  The 8 corners pizza literally solves every pizza quarrel you have ever had, you know, the who gets the corner piece debacle? You get eight corner pieces in two pizzas, enough to feed three very hungry men. Or 4 normal hungry people! If that isn't enough, listen to me, try the Greek salad! The ingredients in this salad scream fresh! Lettuce, feta cheese, beets, pepperonchinis and a house made Greek vinaigrette!

Looking for that reliable pizza joint to become a regular at? Stop looking and try Jets!

Oh and don't forget to add flavor to your crust for free!"}
{"text":"Jet's is a really good takeout pizza joint.  Eight corner pizzas and part trays are the best.    

Only downfall is the prepackaged salads and packet dressings."}
{"text":"Hello friends,

Well, this place has been open for almost 2 months. I've been waitin 4 someone to try it out and review it before I tried butttttt no one did, soooo here I Am!!

I finally used this advertisement that was placed on my door. (Free Pizza...LG Deep Dish 1 Topping.  No purchase necessary) 

I was out and about so instead of delivery I did carry-out. When I walked in (Sporting my OHIO STATE shirt, I was greeted with a big smile from Joseph) he simply greeted me with O-H. When I heard that, I  replied with I-O!! I KNEW I WAS N A GOOD PLACE. 

No problem with my Free pizza coupon asked if I wanted to order anything else so I did. Honey BBQ wings. Waited bout 15-20 mins. 

I'm what one may call ummm how do you say, a food lush, greedy! I'll just say my mom called me Yum Yum Eat em Up when I was younger. 

Saying that, to say before I backed out of the parking lot I inhaled a wing. Slap Yo Momma good. When I made it back I opened up the pizza box and was happy to see some good oowee goowee cheesy pizza. I will say the sauce (like in other reviews for the other locations) was missing I'd say a Pinch to a Punch of salt. It wasn't bad, but wasn't the greatest. I will def be back. They offer a few different types of crust. (Like HH Pizza) 

There are a number of 4 seat tables. Some in the front and more to the back. The front section looks more appealing due to the big windows. Drink machine and two tv's (nice BIG TV's). Now the next problem ill have is where to take a nap, but that's NOT their fault. Like I said, I was called Yum Yum Eat em Up.

{"text":"Amazing deep dish pizza! A guilty pleasure of ours once a month! Any of their flavors are good but try the Hawaiian Deep Dish or any of their deep dish pizzas for that matter! 

The service is great but the pizza is better!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times now for their deep.dish slices, and they're quite delicious.  It's only about $2 for a slice, which is a bargain in my mind.  I grew up on deep dish Pizza Hut pizza, which is kind of similar to this... But this is so much better!  It's a very bready deep dish, but has the appropriate toppings to compensate.  The crust is crunchified by a layer of golden-brown cheese, which only adds to deliciousness.  Definitely give them a try for their lunch special!"}
{"text":"Very good service and food normal pricing. The people are excellent great  by the slice or whole pie"}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering online. 
It took them 50 minutes to realize there was an online order. They told me that I should call to confirm the online order the next time I do an online order which defeats the purpose of online ordering."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best pizza I've ever had. Also, some of the best wings and ranch I've ever had!! I am officially hooked!!"}
{"text":"Jets is always our go to pizza place! My family's favorite. Everyone we have over who tries it loves it! Definitely the best pizza around"}
{"text":"This pizza has the best arrangment when it comes to the BBQ chicken pizza.. The flavors have a party in my mouth with every bite! Cost of the pizza may be a bit high, but it is really worth the difference in the price. We come here almost every month.."}
{"text":"This place is good when it's good and bad when it's bad.  I have been here on many occasions and for the most part enjoy my food.  They have a lunch special: 2 slices and a drink for $5, which is very good and I can walk from work.  The employees are pleasant and helpful.  If the pizza is fresh, it is great. Occasionally you will get a slice that been sitting-not so great.  Overall, good pizza (deep dish) and friendly environment."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Always come in for lunch and never have to wait.  The pizza is good and pricing is good as well.  I like the salads,  they are very well made. Good service each time I've been in."}
{"text":"The most amazing pizza!!!! You can watch them make your pizza which is really cool. Make sure you get a side of ranch, it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Well, they deliver, and they do a mighty fine job at it. A cordial, fresh-faced courier was at our doorstep with a bunch of food in his arms on a snowy afternoon, and when the crew goofed and the manager came out personally to present us with the cinnamon sticks we ordered instead of the cheesy bread sticks they sent (and they aren't worth a dissertation), I was impressed.

The food, however, wasn't so swift. 

I can't say I was disappointed, since I knew that what this 37 year-old chain peddles couldn't be too delectable. When I saw the Jet's franchise being built in Banksville Plaza and that Super Mario Brothers reject of a flying mascot they have, I kinda figured we were in for some crummy food. 

It was edible and not much else. The Italian hoagie I had came in its own nifty rectangular, foil-lined box, and in lieu of a bun, the innards of the hero were contained by two slices of a crostini/bruschetta-like garlic bread. However, aside from the innovative presentation and construction, not to mention the somewhat generous deli meats, the flavors were absent. 

Also bought was a deep dish pizza that recalled a halfway point between Pizza Hut and Dominos. The crust was thick, crispy, and buttery, and that's about all it had going for it. The cheese and the sauce were there but only as a matter of fact. In terms of taste, I might as well have been eating an English muffin. 

I've had mall churros that were better than Jet's cinnamon sticks. We could have run up to the market, purchased a box of something similar, and nuked them at home. They tasted like some giant frozen food conglomerate's experiment involving the elementary school demographic and breakfast. 

Keep the food, and gimme me that sweet jet pack, jack."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but if you look under the cheese you'll see that it's still not done and it's doughy I couldn't eat anymore I just don't like eating Raw dough fix it and I ordered three large pizzas and they were all the same doughy in the deep dish"}
{"text":"I read reviews for another location awhile back and was horrified. I was seriously afraid to try this chain. It's new to me, but the description of their pizzas was so tantalizing. So, I felt like it was my duty to put on a brave face...and try it for myself.

Surprise! 

It was delicious! I tried the meaty deep dish with garlic/buttery crust. It was a little oily but the flavor was DELISH. I ordered delivery, (we all feel a little lazy sometimes) and when it arrived the carrier apologized for being late. I hadn't even noticed! But he was kind and polite and assured me the pizza was still hot.

I opened the box to a scrumptious looking deep dish pizza and honey BBQ wings. Everything was yummy. The meat to cheese ratio was acceptable and the crust was crunchy, buttery, awesomeness. 

Guess what!

I will try them again! Go on, everyone. Have no fear. Jets Pizza is a new favorite pizza delivery spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to get a couple of slices of pizza for lunch.  
Jet's has 4 styles of pizza: Signature Deep Dish, Hand Tossed Round, Thin and NY style.
By the slice, Jet's only has the Signature Deep Dish.  
The menu has Wings, Salads, Jet's Boat  and Jetzee Subs.
This location is only take out or delivery.  No tables and a rather small waiting area that was crowded.
The pizza was pretty good.  Nice thick bread crust with a tomato sauce that was thick and probably a little to much on the pizza and mozzarella cheese that was good."}
{"text":"I just tried Jets for the first time and OH MY GOODNESS. I don't think I can ever go back to getting take out pizza from anywhere else. The pizza is of great quality, as are the ingredients. Delivery was prompt and on time for when I scheduled it. 

If you love pizza like I do They are so worth giving a try."}
{"text":"I just picked up Jet's for a meeting and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved the deep dish crust which had good flavor. I ordered half pepperoni and half sausage. You can also get the crusts flavored, but we didn't. Location is in the center of Westlake slightly off the beaten path. Prices are reasonable and service was good."}
{"text":"First time ordering pizza from Jets and I wasn't overly impressed but I also wasn't disappointed. I ordered the hand tossed with half green peppers and mushrooms with normal amounts of sauce and cheese. The crust was actually pretty good however the pizza could probably have used a little more sauce. The sauce was slightly bitter but overall had a pretty decent taste. We will probably try the deep dish next time."}
{"text":"Sorry losers, Jets Pizza is way better than any of your papa johns crap that you and your fat cousin sit back and munch on while you watch arena football. Jets garlic and cheese crust as well as their sauce is unreal, could easily see ordering a few of their deep dish pizzas for the next family outing. Extremely friendly staff as well, will help out and customize your order to just about any specification you want. I drive 30 minutes just to get this pizza even though I have a papa johns and a dominoes within 5 minutes. Hey papa john, Jett's just called, your fired!"}
{"text":"Love jets pizza!!! I was so happy to see something from Michigan here. The pizza is great! The deep dish Square pizza is amazing! Love it! Must try it. The pizza is fresh with amazing sauce and toppings. Great location too."}
{"text":"I tried Jets based on reviews. Not good and that is being nice.....disappointed. Very little flavor, cool upon delivery. Poor quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Had carryout a couple times then delivery yesterday. I have only had the deep dish and it is always good, enjoyed the greek salad also. I suspect they lose some business to Little Caesars just on price, but this pizza has better quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and wanted to try something local. Solid cheese bread, a killer deep dish, friendly service AND a free coozie. Thank you Jets!"}
{"text":"I LOVE JETS!! Especially this location! The staff is always friendly and the pizza is always consistent. I highly recommend the deep dish with turbo crust!"}
{"text":"I tried their deep dish. The meat pizza. It was very good. Detroit style. If you had deep deep dish at Little Caesars. It is the same style. But made with quality ingredients. Priced a little high. But very good."}
{"text":"Clean store in and out. A few tables inside if you prefer to eat in but dining area is very small. I prefer to take out. Cashier/order taker was very friendly. I ordered a medium pizza which is 8 square slices and boneless buffalo wings. The pizza was delicious. Thick crust, not deep dish but close. Pizza's edges were crunchy and the center was soft. The boneless buffalo wings were better than I expected. The sauce was right on - not too mild and too spicy. Ranch is extra but sides such as crushed red peppers and parmesan cheese are free. Store also delivers."}
{"text":"So we've ordered takeout and delivery from Jets 10+ times and never any issues. Their deep dish is our favorite! Turbo crust is a must. Wings are large and juicy. Just wanted to say THANK YOU to Tyson and his manager for taking care of a special request today. I called about 11am and asked if a driver was willing and allowed to drive slightly outside of their normal delivery area. Tyson answered the phone, gladly accepted the request, cleared it with his manager, and took care of business! Businesses that find a way to say YES to special requests will always get our $. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"My parents ordered Jet's pizza and I got to taste it again for the second time this week!  It was deep dish style with sausage and cheese.  It was very tasty.  The next day, I polished off a leftover stromboli.  I love stromboli and this one was darn tasty.  I'd order it again.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Andy one if the managers is helpful. Will continue to order pizza there"}
{"text":"Canned mushrooms, need I say more? Well, if that wasn't enough, the wings are oven baked, not fried. They don't come with ranch or blue cheese dressing automatically; you have to pay extra for them and they are prepackaged Ken's brand. The wings only come in three flavors; not nearly the selection that is available at Barro's or Native. We wanted to give this new place in our neighborhood a try, but we won't be back. The service was friendly and the joint was clean, just not our cup of tea."}
{"text":"Great deep dish pizza! Found this place through a referral and was pleasantly surprised. Did pick up, but was still hot when we got it home. The limited delivery area was a concern, but we had heard good things so we decided to pick up and it was well worth it."}
{"text":"The food is great, and they always have some kind of deal or coupon! This is honestly my favorite pizza chain. They have real ranch that they make in the the store and the crust flavors are delish. Delivery is slower than other places though, that is the only setback."}
{"text":"WTAF is happening here? I read the reviews on this place and bookmarked it expecting some great pizza \"Detroit-style\", whatever that means. Apparently Detroit pizza is Little Caesars pizza. I went in and ordered a pan pizza to go, tossed it in the car and took it home. When I bit into the pizza I realized it looks and tastes just like Little Caesars so all these people wishing they could have Detroit pizza apparently have been missing out. If you like LC, this place is for you and it's 5 stars. Beyond that I don't get why people are so excited."}
{"text":"I ordered a sheet yesterday for my daughter's birthday. Everyone loved it! The crust is fantastic! I barely order anywhere else for pizza since they came to Parma."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Jet's yesterday for the first time and it turned out to be really good. We did the square style deep dish for a traditional pepperoni, a veggie, and a buffalo chicken pizza. All three were good; overall oder of preference was probably pepperoni-veggie-buffalo chicken. The buffalo chicken had a good flavor overall but the ranch replacing the pizza sauce made it a little heavy for my tastes. The best part of these pizza's are the crunchy cheese around the crust, and that part is pretty amazing. The ingredients seem to be high quality (especially the cheese and toppings) and while the crust is slightly on the sweet side it is perfectly appropriate for this style of pizza. 

I also tried the hot chicken wings which were very good, although they steamed a bit on the delivery box making the skin a little rubbery. Another 90 seconds in the cooker would probably not have been a terrible thing, but the flavor was great. 

The delivery was prompt (especially for a somewhat out of the way location) and the driver was very courteous. Ordering over the phone was easy, even though some training was still ongoing (not surprising given the newness of the location). 

Value was solid but not extraordinary, and while on the call I was told a few coupons were being applied, which was appreciated. We ordered too much pizza for one meal so in the future the cost might come down significantly. 

Unfortunately the online ordering is not yet available but I expect to see that up soon. 

All in all I'd say Jet's is a nice addition to the delivery options in Middleton and i expect it will see some fair percentage of our lazy pizza orders. With Brutta opening right down the street Middleton is starting to get quite a few pizza options (although comparing these two is really apples and firetrucks). In the future I'd like to give some of the other menu options a try (salads, sandwiches, maybe even the dessert) and for now I'd say this is an upgrade over Roman Candle. Once Glass Nickel is back up and running Jet's may face some stiffer competition, but for now it's pretty cool to have a new kid on the Middleton pizza delivery block..."}
{"text":"Having spent a year in Iowa, I can understand that Jet's would please many from the Midwest, those who expect neither seasoning or concern with rising above the common. We are not pizza eaters. Rather, we tried the wings, which were cooked and seasoned decently if not outstandingly, but which had been cooked in oil that was on the edge of going back. Quite simply, the smell will last in our home far longer than we would have wished. We also had a salad, antipasto. While the lettuce was fresh enough as were the cherry tomatoes, the salad was unremarkable. The meat tasted exactly as one would expect given that Midwestern categorization, that is hardly at all. The canned, black olives too lacked flavor. Using Ken's Blue Cheese dressing again emphasized the unremarkable quality of this take-out stand storefront in a strip mall."}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood restaurant. Amazing pizza, friendly service, amazing prices."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a very affordable price
Delivery took a bit but well worth the wait!
Welcome to the neighborhood Jet Pizza!"}
{"text":"Dammit!!!!

This place fell off!

I had a huge house of people over for Thrones season kickoff and decided to turn them all on to Jets. Ordered a handful of larges, not a single discount would be applied.

Pizzas arrived and all were lacking seriously in the sauce and cheese dept. they were just OFF. I felt bad because it's always been amazing.

So pissed and disappointed."}
{"text":"Looooove their pizza! I always get the pepperoni deep dish with garlic crust. Yum! Have been off a couple of times but most of the time they are on point!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.we ordered cheese sticks and deep dish pizza. We choose jet turbo crust and we are happy that everything was great. We all love the pizza  and cheese sticks. We had groupon and service was kind.

We will definitely go again......for large square pizza :)"}
{"text":"Go for the deep dish square pizza w/ turbo crust - you can't go wrong! Need a quick lunch, the slice and pop deal will keep you more than full until dinner.... Great pizza at a good price"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious! Deep dish is one of the best I've had. I love pizza and this place definitely is one of the best in Charlotte/Huntersville area."}
{"text":"My most favorite pizza ever!!! Edges and turbo crust, I'm in heaven every time I indulge in Jet's pizza. I use to love the other pan pizza until the manager told me they changed the recipe, oh well, i'm thankful because I never would've found Jet's. The one who would've got away if I hadn't run from the other pan pizza."}
{"text":"The best deep dish pizza in Huntersville.  We order it all the time at work."}
{"text":"Jets is the best. I don't have one in my home town but always try to enjoy a Jets pizza when I visit Charlotte and Birmingham. Always hot and awesome! Thanks"}
{"text":"Got delivery on a Friday night, wasn't expecting much but didn't want to get the usual suspects (papa johns, dominos, blehh) so we decided to give jets a shot. I'd had them once back in Ohio and thought it was decent so we put in the order. 

Breadsticks (jetstix): amazing, some of the best breadsticks we've had from a chain pizza place. 

Cheesy Bread: very tasty, not soggy at all, would order again. 

Cinnamon Stix: also some of the best we've ever had from a chain pizza place. Just sweet enough. 

Hand tossed cheese pizza: okay. nothing really stood out, perfectly average. 

Deep Dish Pepperoni and Pineapple: I enjoyed it. Its greasy but hey, it's deep dish pizza, what do you expect. Good amount of toppings. 

Overall, definitely would order from Jets before ordering from any other chain again. Check it out if you're into deep dish and want to change it up a little bit!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Food was good okay.  The service was nice and the place was clean.  Price was reasonable.  This is our second visit.  Pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Love the pizza with the turbo crust! So good. I gave 4 stars due to the price. A supreme pizza is usually more than what I like to pay"}
{"text":"Coming from Michigan this is definitely the real deal! My all time favorite pizza place in all of Arizona! The ingredients are always fresh and definitely quality. My fiancé and I eat here about twice a week and it's always on point!"}
{"text":"My job ordered veggie pizza and salad today from Jet's. It is tasty. Jet's is always a solid option. 

Veggie pizza is packed with onions, peppers, tomatoes, black olives and mushrooms! For a vegetarian such as myself, this is heaven!"}
{"text":"Remember when you were a kid and you saw those deep dish pizza commercials and you drooled and always wish it tasted like it looked?? Well Jet's tasted like what you imagined! It is SO GOOD! We got the 8 corner veggie and half pepperoni. The crust was so tasty. It was ready fast and ordering online is easier than dominos. They also donate to charities and have some great specials. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, awesome to have Jets Pizza in town. Wish I was in the delivery area but it's worth the drive. Great pizza. Crust options are crazy good. Go Turbo Crust and you won't be disappointed. Go for the Bold Pepperoni. You won't go wrong with any of the salads either. Being from Michigan originally whenever I went back Jets Pizza was always a must do. Now I can go whenever I want which make me a happy Michigander."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I've had half-way decent pizza from here and pizza so lousy I should have returned it and asked for my money back.  The last time I ordered from this store, one pizza was OK, but, half of the second pie was inedible because it was mounded with green olives and soaked with green olive juice.
I'm not willing to roll the dice with Jet's again."}
{"text":"Pizza, jets bread, hoagies and wings all good here! Only downfall is that I ordered the 8 cut and they gave me two 4 cuts inside the box. I am a fan of the middle pieces but ended up with 8 end pieces. They don't deliver to my area. However when I pulled in the lot I seen a delivery guy leave and when I was on my way home I seen the delivery guy taking pizza to a house 3 minutes away from mine. Guess I just missed the cut by 3 minutes."}
{"text":"My wife had to go to a gluten free diet a couple years ago so since then we have tried every gluten free pizza we have found.  Jets is by far the best we have found and this is comparing to some of the nicer set down restaurants in bigger cities."}
{"text":"I got the recommendation from Joe the Mailman.

I went today to pick up a deep dish pie. Joe was right. 
Best pizza pie around.  Very tasty, crust is to die for.
We Will definitely be back to try the thin crust. 
My 91 year old client is the pizza connoisseur.
She gave Jets ***** Stars!!!!

{"text":"Jet's seriously has the best pan pizza in Cleveland. The All Meaty Specialty is all delicious!"}
{"text":"1st time order last night while working in area. Loved the 8 corner pizza with bacon. Order taker was nice, cashier was nice and price was good (getting 2-3 solo meals out of it)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat with my sister. This is a place that I've always just drove by since it is kind of hidden in the corner of a parking lot. We walked in & started looking at the menu on the wall. The cashier was very nice & gave us an easier menu to look at. With the cahier knowing that we've never been there, he explained where their pizza originated from as well the items on the menu. It wasn't a long drawn out explanation, but just enough to get our taste buds watering! They have special for 2 slices & a pop, so I had to partake. The first bite & every bite after that was amazing, it was great flavor all around!! I have to say I was very impressed with the food & the service!! I shall return!"}
{"text":"My friend has been hyping up Jets Pizza for a while now. He said it is awesome and that I need to try it. He compared it to Angelos in Lakewood. After reading up on it, I decided to try it out while on the way to Fin, Feather Fur. Jets Pizza is a small chain based out of south Michigan. They have flavored crusts like Hungry Howies. The logo is a stroke of genius. My friend advised that I try the square deep dish and turbo stix, which are bread sticks with a few cheeses on them. Turbo stix is one of the best names ever, yet I did not try them. I thought the pizza was good. It is sitting in the fridge right now, waiting for me to get drunk and eat it."}
{"text":"Absolute price GOUGE. Little tiny (8 corner pizza) and (Cornish hen wings at best) chicken wings for 30 bucks... We are talking the worst price gouging I have ever seen. I want to make clear that it was VERY GOOD pizza, however... WOW we wont be able to sit down for weeks after this pounding. OUCH."}
{"text":"Best pizza you're going to get out here hands down. The deep dish couldn't be any better...make sure you get turbo crust and sides of ranch!"}
{"text":"They screwed up our order 3 times in one night and them coming to deliver is such a waste of time just waiting for them to come in give us the right pizza."}
{"text":"Not good at all. Crust was black because it was so burnt and the rest of it was so greasy. Just overall bad pizza."}
{"text":"Detroit's finest! Love this place! Service ROCKS too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GO TIGERS!"}
{"text":"I am not a chain pizza delivery person, but after seeing other Yelp reviews, their delivery vehicle around town and the fact I was craving pizza, I decided to give Jet's a try, and am glad I did.
I ordered a small pizza, original crust, with half pepperoni & a garden salad.

Although Jet's looks to be known for their deep dish I thought I'd order the original crust to give them a try. The pizza was cooked to perfection. A nice pizza, perfectly chewy with a slight crisp crust, perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni! As for the salad, thank you Jet's! One thing about pizza delivery places is the fact they do not offer salads, why? Jet's does, and several options..Chef's, Garden & a few more. I chose the garden salad and it was fresh romaine mix with cheese, onions, tomatoes and more. A perfect pairing with the pizza!"}
{"text":"The worst and I mean WORST service! Gave this place three tries and zero of the three came out good. The owner isn't nice not is the staff. Too bad too bc the pizza is actually decent. I would rather buy a pizza oven and make my own pizza then order from here again. Rudest people on earth."}
{"text":"Jets is a big deal back home In Michigan so the expectations were high going in. I was immediately waited on. Rochester MI is where he from so I'll call him Rochester. Rochester was very nice as I explained my expectations. He guaranteed me I would be disappointed it just like home. We dined in. It's a very small area. I wouldn't recommend any party over 6 to dine in. 

So my small half pepperoni half mushroom pizza is ready. Smells delicious! My first bite and I flashed back to Detroit / Dearborn!!!! The flavor was like a party in my mouth the sauce was perfect and the crust had the perfect crunch!!' Oh bread sticks and boneless chicken was good. But the pizza was just as I remembered it!!!! 

Thank you for coming to Chandler, I was not disappointed!!!!!!'nn"}
{"text":"Oh man I am pizza addict and Jet's is feeding my problem.   I haven't found a good deeper dish pizza(not the official Chicago style) with thick and fluffy crust with nice crusty and tasty cheese in Charlotte until we tried tried a Jet's special one afternoon. 

Upon boxing the glorious cheese rectangular sculpture, my eye lit up.  The Crust was thick, the cheese was gooey, the edges had nice carmelization.  It was the tastiest pizza of the hour.    I eat probably 1/2 to 3/4 of a large pizza in one sitting.  (I have a pizza problem)"}
{"text":"Moved to the valley from MI and have always loved Jets pizza. I've been to this location a few times BUT an occurrence this last visit has me rethinking future visits or recommending Jets Pizza to anyone. My order came to $51 and some change ( 2 pizzas, Grilled Chix Caesar salad) I asked for blue cheese and Caesar dressing as this salad was being shared. Once I arrived to pick up I saw the small Kens blue cheese salad dressing packet and asked for 1 more. The young gentleman told me it would be .81 , he had me run out to my car to get the money. A few problems with this ...the salad you sell is very large so asking or supplying more dressing should not be an extra charge. Also after I already paid a $51 check with my CC the gentleman didn't have good customer service or knowledge to just comp the extra dressing instead had me run to my car for .81. It's also simply principle. As well as flat out good customer service."}
{"text":"Lets just say ill be writing corporate. The worst customer service and attitude. Never turn away a customer. And show respect . Will never visit again."}
{"text":"As far as cheap pizza goes, Jet's is great. The crust is crunchy. The sauce is decent. The cheese is real cheese. The toppings, while spare (because it is cheap pizza), are very good. 

I'm a fan of the Detroit-style pizza and Jet's does it as well as anyone else."}
{"text":"I think they have good pizza, my two concerns is that the person that take your order don't always wash there hands after touching the money. And it's a little over piece, $$$$ !!"}
{"text":"There is only 2 chains of pizza I will order in CLE, and this is one of them.  This is a pizza place that serves a few diff styles of pizza, but I love the thick crust pizza.  It's not a pizza you want all the time, but when you want it it's a def a craving.  The thick crust is square and in the 'Detroit style' where the crust is burned w cheese to make it crispy and delicious. It doesn't feature the red sauce on top like real D style pizzas, but that's ok. I like their broad delivery service.  The Jet's bread is decadent, I order w cheese and bacon.  Also, the lunch combos of two fresh made square thick crust slices and a soda for around $5 is great. The salad is literally lettuce w various pizza toppings on it. That was kind of silly.  I will be ordering soon as it's been a while and I will soon need my fix."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and decided to order something different. Placed an order with no issues. It had snowed pretty heavily the night before and was informed it would take about 40 minutes to get our food to the hotel which to me is understandable. Where the issue comes in is that after an 1 1/2 we called them asking where our food was and they informed us that their driver had just returned back to the store with our order. Cameron who answered the phone both times said that they had tried calling us and even the driver text but never received any calls/missed calls or messages. He then said the driver went to the front desk looking for us but the room was under my name and not my gf's and they told him a room 1 number off. Terrible service especially if you can't own up to your own mistakes and be honest about things. Only reason I give it two stars is because the pizza was \"still hot\" and tasted good"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! ONE OF THE BEST pizzas you can get!!! Their BBQ chicken is awesome!!! Hungry Howies and Jets are #1. If you dont believe it, you gotta try it. :)"}
{"text":"No, Jet's isn't the best deep dish pizza I have ever had (eehhmm Uno's) BUT it is still pretty damn good! I found a Groupon, $20 worth of pizza for $11 plus tax...not holding it against them since they did include it in the terms. 

We called in for a deep dish chicken parmesan pizza, we weren't disappointed with the yummy deliciousness! The crust is crispy and thick while the pizza was given ample toppings and cheese. It took us forever to finish the huge pizza. 

In addition to all of this, the cashier was a very nice lady who had sadly been harassed by a different Groupon user for having to pay tax. Dude, you should have read the fine print before blowing a gasket. 

We will be returning, money well spent!"}
{"text":"Jet's is a hidden gem in Phoenix. Had never heard of it and was instantly amazed as soon as it hit my lips. Ordered it again just a few nights later because I was craving it so bad. Whatever you order, get the turbo crust!"}
{"text":"I have ordered twice from Jet's online. Always on time and correct order. I have traveled the States and world with a career in the Army. I have had pizza from all over! This is great pizza! The deep dish is fantastic."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
8 corner pizza with turbo crust says it all. There is something about the blend of cheese and garlic sauce that just makes this a delicious pizza. They are running a promotion for 13.99 which is more than papa john or pizza hut large pizza, but the pepperoni 8 corner pizza is simply delicious. I think the copious amounts of cheese is what sets it apart from other pizza places. Overall service is fast. It took 20 minutes from order to pickup. The only downside is the parking lot is super cramped and hard to get into.

Pros: free flavored crust options, quick service

Cons: more expensive than papa john or pizza hut, but the 8 corner pizza is amazing

{"text":"Restaurant review
Although this is a chain pizza restaurant, this is one of my favorite pizza places in Champaign. It reminds me of the original Little Caesar pizzas, great burnt cheese crust. Service is super fast and you can order online now. Pizzas are usually ready in 20 minutes. Also flavorizing your crust is simply delicious (I recommend the turbo crust). If you want a hearty pizza, Jets is the way to go

Pros: can order online, not a classic deep dish but still very cheesy and delicious

Cons: High in calories!

{"text":"I had a deep dish pepperoni the other night.
Lots of gooey cheese and pepperoni. It was great!
I think ill order another one NOW!"}
{"text":"We are from Michigan and found out there is Jet's Pizza in Phoenix!!! We live in Las Vegas, but have family in Tucson.  We plan on driving through in the next month and stopping for Jet's on the way to and from Tucson.  We are so excited!! Please, please, please open a location in Las Vegas!!!!! There are thousands of people in Vegas from Michigan who would die for this in town!"}
{"text":"Jet's pizza is delicious. I have tried it twice. The this square cuts are crispy and delicious and the Jet's bread is like a cheesy breadstick! The delivery was relatively quick and the customer service was great. I will definitely order again. The size large is not as big as i thought it would be, but the thick slices are more filling than typical round pizza. They also have great ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time this week. Easy ordering from yelp. Pizza was very good. Loved the sauce and crispy crust.Will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom.... More please! The turbo crust & spicy pepperoni is soooooo good... Their deep dish is legit! I love pizza and have explored most of the pizza places around Cleveland but Jet's definitely competes with Angelos. I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't really call this \"deep dish\", it's more like \"really thick crust\". My fiancé liked it significantly more than I did: he's from the Detroit area and I'm from New England, so we have very different ideas on pizza! 

I tried to put my thin-crust-love aside but I felt like Jets pizza was more of a breadstick with a tiny bit of sauce and some cheese. We also got a side of breadsticks, which was totally redundant. 

Service could be a little more friendly... I'm kind of happy they don't have indoor seating!"}
{"text":"I contacted the franchise headquarters and was then contacted by the location manager.  I was offered 50% off my next order, but I asked for a refund instead.  I was promptly mailed a refund check.  I am very glad they made things right for me."}
{"text":"Do you like excessive amounts of cheese? Do you like to receive food faster than you could ever imagine possible? Do you like things that are awesome? Then you will love Jet's!
Jet's pizza is delish through and through. The crust is chewy and soft and there is probably about 7 pounds of mozzarella on each pizza. I agree with Faith's previous review that it is \"greasy like crazy\", but I'm pretty sure that's what makes it so darn good! The Jet's bread is mighty good also. Tons of cheese, same chewy crust and some delicious seasoning that puts it over the edge. My favorite thing over all though is probably the crispy, crusty cheese on the edges of the pizza. It is awesome. And as if delicious pizza wasn't enough, they deliver SO FAST. Call on a Friday night and it's there in 30 minutes. Crazy. The prices are also very reasonable for the level of awesomeness. Overall, Jet's is a delight."}
{"text":"Meh- nothing special about it. The large is the size of the medium at most other places. In the future I will just drive a few minutes further down 51 and go to Pizza Spiga. Their pizza is much better and you get more for your money. That is where I usually go...and where I will continue to go. Skip Jets, nothing to see here."}
{"text":"We have a standing order at this location. 8 corner veggie, all the way. Make ya slap yo mamma! Thats just about it."}
{"text":"Use to love their pizza... It was our go to place..... Ordered pizza and a hoagie 20 min later they called me and said sorry we can't deliver to your area but your foods ready if you want to pick it up...?????WHAT.... Mind you they have delieverd to us at least 20 times before now all of a sudden were out of their delivery range....... They lost us as a customer!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place when we lived in ohio and still is great.  Had the deep dish buffalo ranch chicken pizza and it hit the spot.  Larry took my order over the phone and checked me out.  Nice service and quick."}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot and wasn't that impressed. 

First the website for online ordering is very confusing and it ended up not sending the correct order to Jets, which the cashier even admitted is very faulty. She told me next time to call to make sure the order is right. Well, kind of defeats the purpose of online ordering. 

When we got there the \"20 minute\" approx time the website gave us wasn't even close. We got there about 40 min  later and still waited a solid 15 minutes. I get that they are new, but the website wasn't even close to approximating the time. There was a group of people waiting that obviously ordered online and were waiting around a LONG time. 

Finally we got the deep dish pizza, and it reminded me a lot of pizza hut, but extremely greasy. I'm not one to complain about the healthiness of pizza, but it left a weird grease film all over my mounth and fingers when I was done. 

It's not bad pizza, its just not anything I'd go back for considering the price. If this was 5.00 little ceasers then I would expect the greasiness."}
{"text":"I actually like the Pizza here but their bumbling employees make the experience awful. Check your order. Recently called in a Pizza for delivery- waited over an hour - called back -?Pizza had been marked \"pick up\". When I came back in and asked for a small credit. They refused. Customer Service is non existent. There are better pizzas that come with less work!"}
{"text":"The man wanted to go and really I had no idea what to expect. I did a go to on Yelp and saw they had an average rating, so therefor I didn't have high expectations.

But let me slow your roll...This pizza is muy delicioso. 

We ordered a deep dish and two slices of cheese.  It took about 15 minutes to get our order, so we walked next door and killed some time. By the time we arrived back, our pizza was ready and waiting for us. This location does not offer dine-in so we took our food to the car. And of course, we took a bite or two or three.

It was hot, crispy, cheesy, buttery and just melt in your mouth good. I am not a fan of all deep dish but this was a winner for sure.

Even when we got home and the pizza wasn't as hot, it was still delicious. Our toppings were not skimpy and it was some of the best pizza eats we have dined on period."}
{"text":"They have really good customer service here. I have never had a bad experience here even though it is a lot of teens working here. This makes me happy. They obviously train their employees well and they must take care of them to consistently do a great job.

The pizza itself wins us over every time. I mean you just can't go wrong with their version of deep dish. The crust is perfect in my opinion - the outside is crunchy and buttery, yet soft on the inside and my toppings have always been fresh.

I love that we can eat in here and actually enjoy our pizza piping hot and fresh. We have also done carry out because  unfortunately I do not live in their delivery area. Carry out is always a breeze."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Jet's .
Was hopeful after seeing high reviews.
Ordered through the website.
2 mediums New York style with turbo crust. Picked up pizza. $30.00 total.
Opened the box and the pepperoni was shriveled up, rolled up to look like a bowl filled with oil. Completely disgusted. The pizza had absolutely no flavor what so ever. Can not believe this is possible. No taste of cheese or pepperoni. Other pizza, same.No taste of pineapple, ham or cheese.  Just card board crust. I wasted $30.00. Never again. Insure what went wrong with this pizza or location....By far very unpleasant. My boys love pizza and stated \"even frozen pizza is better\". Stick with NYPD off scottsdale and Shea."}
{"text":"I got the $5.50 combo (2 slices and a soda) and I say it was a little too expensive for what I got. They seemed to carry all name brand sodas except for Dr. Pepper. They had Doc 360..? Kinda weird but it tasted the same. The slices were small little squares and they were pretty good. I probably won't be back in Champaign-Urbana anytime soon, but if I ever do go back I will most likely try a different place."}
{"text":"Just ordered The Jet's 10 Small 4-Corner & a Small 4-Corner with Bold Pepperoni, Ground Beef, Mushrooms & Red Onions. Both Pizza's had a flavored Crust. Both were Baked Well Done with Extra Sauce. Both Pies were sooooo good. They even looked attractive enough to eat. The only complaint is, the owner could drop, the prices a few dollars and start competing, with the top-3 franchises, which will give working stiffs like me, an continued opportunity, to afford this great tasty cuisine, from my home town, of Michigan.
\"JUST SAYING.\""}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly. We usually order delivery and the drivers are always fast and love to chat with us. We love the pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I live in a pizza Bermuda triangle where almost all my options are chain stores.  I'm outside the delivery areas of Intermezzo, Libretto's (both locations), Pure Pizza, etc. *shakes fist*  The few non-chain places that deliver (looking at you, Wolfman) fail to impress.

Jet's Pizza was my last ditch effort to find good delivery pizza.  The reviews were good, the website was decent, and I could order online.  Looked promising.  Everything went smoothly until it came time for the actual delivery.

My apartment complex is gated, so you have to ring a call box and be buzzed through.  The delivery guy reached me on the call box and I hit the number on my phone to allow him in. I am literally (proper use) the first building on the right after passing the gate.  It takes a car 10 seconds at most to get to us.

10 minutes go by.  No pizza.  No sign of the car outside my window.

15 minutes go by.  No pizza.  I call the pizza place and ask where their guy is.  The manager said he hadn't gotten into my complex and was still waiting outside.  I politely corrected him by saying I had successfully buzzed the dude through.  The manager would give him another call and see what was happening.

20 minutes passes.  I called the restaurant again.  The manager was getting irritated with me and gave me attitude, as if it were my fault that the driver couldn't find my apartment.  In an antagonistic fashion he finally barked, \"What, you want a credit?\"

At this point I gave up hope on getting a hot pizza.  Or a pizza at all.  \"Sure,\" I replied.  Manager confirmed the credit and hung up.  25 minutes later, I hear a knock at my door.

His excuse, \"My GPS took me the wrong way.\"  Normally I would have given him the benefit of the doubt, but in this case I had written turn-by-turn instructions on how to get to my house on the order.  I could see them printed out on the ticket he had in his hand.  The one he chose to ignore for 25 minutes.

A 10 second trip past a gate became a 25 minute odyssey of crappy customer service and lame excuses. It's a real shame because when I finally tried the pizza it wasn't bad for lukewarm deep dish.  Even with a credit waiting for me I'd be hard pressed to give them another chance.  Crap customer service always leaves a bad taste no matter how good the food."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!  Their salads are equally as good!  I've always done carry-out and they are always on time."}
