{"text":"I wish I could give them a better review because of all the GF options here, however service and atmosphere completely ruined the experience. I am taking into consideration that it was a very busy night, Christmas eve, however there were just too many issues to overlook. First impression was pretty bad. We waited in line and nobody checked in with us for so long that despite the fact that we had reservations, I had to telephone the restaurant from the lineup to advise that we were there so that they did not give away our table. The two adults in our party wanted AYCE but the children only each wanted one dish each. However we were told, very abruptly, that the children must order AYCE as well, so we paid $20.99 for one of them to eat a few noodles and the other to eat 6 dumplings. I think that rule implies that we plan to cheat the restaurant by ordering for the kids off the regular menu and then feeding them AYCE, which we would never do. We really should have left when the server rudely told us of this rule but it was a busy night and we had not GF backup plan. The place was loud and packed and the dance club music pounding from the speakers behind me exacerbated the noise. We were seated in the front window and beside the door thus we were subject to the folks in line staring at us throughout our entire meal, which added to the overall discomfort. The food, however was quite good. We tried a number of dishes but did not get several of the ones we had ordered. Ironically my 9 year-old did not get the only thing she wanted: edamame. @$20.99 plus tax to not get the one thing she asked for. We did not get the pad thai or the chicken we ordered and the General Tao we had ordered mild so the children (who were forced to pay for AYCE) could taste it came extra spicy; you could see the chili flakes on the chicken. Unfortunately they were too busy for us to successfully flag anyone down to ask for missing dishes, water or milder general tao and we really wanted to get out of there in a hurry. I am judging harshly despite the fact that it was a busy night because crappy service is never ok, and the price was very high for four of us."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and looking for quick and tasty food then Riz is the answer.  

They have just completed a renovation, softening the ambiance. 

Must have the cashew chicken, spicy beans. Tons of vegetarian items and a grat gluten free menu. 

Service is quick and efficient. Food is delicious."}
{"text":"Closes Chinese restaurant in the hood and didn't feel like driving downtown for it. 

Did a take out order of:

1. Pad Thai Chicken & Shrimp 
2. Spicy Szechuan Chicken  
3. Beef & Broccoli 
4. Small Jasmine Rice

$43 Total, portions were quite small and the chicken and beef were really nothing special, Pad Thai was good and rice is rice."}
{"text":"Amazing all-you-can-eat menu. We ordered dishes for the tabled and shared. Portions were small so we tried out a lot of different dishes. Every single one was delicious.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The restaurant is actually up in the Moore Park area, but they'll deliver all the way down to Bloor St. It's a Vietnamese fusion place. Expect lots of flavor, a bit pricier, but cleaner than most and they deliver in sustainable and reusable Tupperware in a posh paper bag with handles. If you're beyond student-priced take out/delivery, then you will really appreciate this joint on stay-in movie night with family or friends."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, and will definitely be back! As someone who needs to eat gluten-free, this place was heaven as it has not just gluten-free options, but a full size menu of just gluten-free items - amazing! Food was delicious, perfect sized portions and was served very quickly. Also appreciated how the gluten-free foods are served on plates labelled GF; as many of their items are available in both regular and GF options, this was nice to know my food wasn't getting mixed up with anyone else at my table. The only downside was that they don't accept debit, which left us scrambling for a moment."}
{"text":"As a gluten-free vegan with gluten-free friends, I end up having conversations about food and food places that other people would likely never have. Like about the fact that many restaurants that claim to cater to gluten-free people actually serve them gluten causing them to become violently ill! I've had \"the talk\" with a number of restaurants and chefs and stores personally about how spelt is NOT gluten-free - don't places do ANY research before selling or marketing a product??? Few things bug me more than restaurants and food vendors NOT knowing what's in their food!

Well, Riz definitely has done its research! When they say they cater to gluten-free peeps, they are SERIOUS about it! They have a separate FULL gluten-free menu (with SPRING ROLLS ON IT - YUM!), gluten-free plates to ensure no accidental contamination and they don't even make items like tempura because, as the manager explained to me, the process in making it necessitates contamination of surrounding items. 

On top of that, they have great tasting food, the service is friendly and knowledgeable, and the prices are pretty standard for asian food (i.e. they're not more expensive despite being considerably more awesome). I went with a friend who is neither gluten-free nor vegan and we both found lots of great choices and both enjoyed our meals. 

We went on a weekday evening, so it was not busy or loud as some of the other reviews have mentioned.  

The decor was very nice - somewhere I'd go with my parents for a nice dinner. The only thing I didn't like was that it was dimly lit. I HATE dimly lit places! I get it - ambiance etc etc but sooo not for me. I want to feel like I'm in full daylight ALWAYS. I would love to go again and will bring my OWN lighting next time for a full 5-star worthy appreciation."}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing but the service is horrible. I went for lunch and waited 15mins for a menu eventhough I requested it after waiting 5mins. After I got my food no server checked on me to see if my meal was okay. Then I asked for the bill and it took the server 25mins to bring it to me. They appear as though they are doing you a favour by serving you meanwhile you're paying for your food and it's not like it's super cheap. Disappointed in the serving staff's lack of customer service skills."}
{"text":"Culturally people have to remember this is an Asian restaurant and for many of the employees English is a second language.  For those people that complain about the culture and the service, I wonder how many are considerate about Asian culture or just expect the restaurant and employees to be catering to all their whims.  I'm Chinese and I've had horrible service at Chinese restaurants and this doesn't come close to those experiences.

That said, we called on a Thursday night and were told while busy they could squeeze us in without a reservation. We arrived about 10 minutes later and were greeted warmly. Our waitress answered all my questions quickly but very adequately in regards to how the restaurant handled gluten.

We ordered the mango rolls, lobster with black bean sauce, sweet and sour chicken and snow peas with broccoli.

The mango rolls were quite good. I liked how the noodles were a bit looser it made it easier to eat the rolls than other rolls I've had in the past.

The lobster was a bit small but quite tasty.  The pad Thai included wasn't really all that memorable but it wasn't horrible either. If I had to be picky here I'd say the noodles were maybe 30 seconds over cooked.

The sweet and sour chicken was quite good.  It is fried with potato starch so it reminds me of Japanese kaarage chicken.  The sauce also isn't overly sweet, and has just the right amount of tang to it. It maintained its crunch quite well even the next day when we ate the leftovers.

Snow peas and broccoli both still had their crunch which was a welcome respite to places that over cook  their vegetables until they turn to mush.

Overall I'm impressed and we will come back when in the GTA area due to all the options on the menu since the other half is a celiac. I cook a lot of Chinese food and grew up in a Chinese restaurant and the food we had for dinner definitely met and exceeded my expectations. Some reviews I read on here make the restaurant sound like it is cold and uncaring but that is not what we experienced.

We saw families celebrating and taking photos with staff.
Staff explaining to us why they started serving gluten free food (hospital nearby and patients on strict diets).
Our waitress hugged us on the way out the door even though we had just met and while waiting for our uber she told us to make ourselves comfortable in the patio until our ride got there.

Good food and I felt like I was being taken care of like a family member.  Not a bad night at all for two Americans randomly finding a gluten free place for dinner after visiting the botanical gardens."}
{"text":"First note: This place is definitely profiting big time from the recent gluten-free dining influx. I believe this is the only consistent quality that has allowed this place to be so apparently popular, since every other aspect of this dining establishment was less than sub-par. Not impressed, to say the least. 

My boyfriend's sister elected to have her birthday dinner here after a few prior visits where she absolutely praised their AYCE gluten-free menu. The trek from Mississauga was overlooked since she has a strong gluten sensitivity and their accommodating menu was quite impressive (in her opinion). 

Upon entry, the place was PACKED. Full house on a Wednesday. This is a pretty small place to begin with, but it was packed to the brim. Our party made a reservation for 10, and once seated realized there were only seats for 7 people. So much for a reservation. Took an unreasonable amount of time to even be acknowledged by a server, and even more time to get those seats, everyone's dishware, menus and even the WATER (we're talking at least 25 mins in total). 

Once someone actually came around to taking our order, server etiquette was not enforced, with a blunt \"What do you want\", and providing sparse answers when inquiring about the size portions - \"I will give what I think will serve this amount of people\".....thanks? Pretty awful too when you come to realize this packed restaurant was being serviced by 2 people total. Great.

Menu was pretty extensive and the value for the AYCE was pretty good actually. Options of a-la-carte, AYCE gluten-free and regular AYCE. Optimal if you're eating with a group, since most dishes were clearly meant to be shared. The positives end there, unfortunately. It took an eternity for them to clear dishes as well, but I guess that only speaks for their lack of staff.

I'm not sure what the deal was with their ventilation, but it was quite hot in there until a few parties left towards the end of our visit. We actually had to excuse ourselves for fresh air a couple of times since it became quite unbearable. Every time the front door opened we looked forward to the refreshing cool air from outside.

Overall, would I return/recommend this place? Absolutely not. Distance aside, even if I was in the area I wouldn't give my business to an establishment with such disregard towards proper hospitality standards. I don't think I've dined anywhere that took so incredibly long to be acknowledged, and so inappropriately at that. I don't even think it's worth tolerating their behaviour even if you have a gluten sensitivity."}
{"text":"We have been numerous times and have never been disappointed.  My daughter is a serious celiac and has never had a problem.  If there was even cross contamination she would end up in the hospital and this is the restaurant of her choice.  The spring rolls, calamari, crispy beef, dim sum, the service, is second to none!"}
{"text":"Dumplings we're off, calamari was off, soy sauce was off. You know it's not a good sign when the best part of your meal is the ginger ale."}
{"text":"This place is great for celiacs and those that are gluten intolerant. Plates actually have the words 'gluten free' so there are no surprises or mixed up. I really wanted to love this place. For being gluten-free, I'm rounding up my 2.5 stars to 3 stars. 

The person I was with felt that the chicken was a bit overcooked (it was sliced so thinly). I just felt that it wasn't anything special (other than the gluten-free). I left thinking that I could have made better tasting gluten free asian food at home. 

We also got the appetizer platter. It was pretty good, but next time I think we would just get a couple of orders of the cold chicken rolls. 

Service was friendly and attentive. I'll probably be back to try another couple of dishes to give it a second chance. 

Side note: using the washroom as a storage spot for your spare furniture and big bottles of soap on the floor under the sink is kinda unsightly."}
{"text":"Though I've eaten here on often, I always get the same dish, Best of Thai Dinner ($25), and I've never been disappointed. I've been here with several friends and everyone seems to enjoy their chosen meals. Unfortunately not a 5 star place because the service can be either good or mediocre, depending on who your server is (one server never smiles and has even been snappy on one occasion). Also, it does get a bit loud sometimes (they often have big groups), and the tables are close together, so not much of a place for romantic evenings. Fills up on Saturday nights so you're best to make reservations."}
{"text":"This place is the best gluten free   restaurant I've been to in Long time.  I usually have a hard time finding a gluten free restaurant that actually doesn't compromise on taste. The crispy beef was my favorite !!! Everything was absolutely delish !!!"}
{"text":"A great Vietnamese- fusion restaurant along Bayview. Great atmosphere and well-priced food; favorite dishes are the tamarin chicken and szechuan crispy beef. It offers a lengthy gluten-free menu for those with that in mind. They do not deliver, but allow for pick-up."}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat menu (non gluten free). Great place to eat. Food was really good and the service was awesome. My girlfriend PT, who loves their wonton soup, didn't really care for some things we ordered (she wouldn't have normally liked them - she was being brave and trying new things), so I gladly finished them off... but that made me miss out on other things I was gonna try.

The crispy beef was really good (didn't taste like fried jerky that other places not to be named put on their plates)."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype on this place. Decor - yep, it is nice, but there are too many tables in this place. 

For such a great, friendly neighbourhood, I find that a lot of the clientele are snooty and uptight. The staff seem to be overworked and have one foot at your table, and another foot ready to run while they take your order. 

Don't go here if you are expecting a relaxed dinner. 

Go here if you want a huge menu to choose from with food that is meh, ok."}
{"text":"CELIACS BEWARE! Went there with my family for dinner. My wife is gluten free and we chose Riz for this reason- they advertise a gluten free menu and their server Wendy confirmed that they have a seperate section of their kitchen where the gluten free meals are prepared. Well to our surprise my wife found a udoon noodle (which is a wheat noodle) in her singapore vermicelli (rice noodles). When she reported this to the server, she was dishonest and tried to say the Udon noodle was a rice  noodle. She finally reduced the bill for the cost of my wifes food and admitted that the Udon noodle was infact a wheat noodle...Still no apology and added a 15% tip to the entire bill. Will not be going back after this bad experience."}
{"text":"Riz is a great pan-asian restaurant. On top of a great selection of asian food, they have an entire gluten free section. What puts this place above most other restaurants is that they nail all their dishes - all of the thai, vietnamese, korean and chinese entrees that I have tried are really good. So a great place if you want to order a mix of food. A little pricey - but you get what you pay for. 

Although they don't deliver, they are part of Restaurants on the Go (www.orderit.ca) - which will deliver for you at around $7."}
{"text":"One of our best loved go-to spots. The tasting menu is the best with many options and order as much as you want. Great atmosphere, amazing friendly staff. It does get busy at times so order a drink and relax, otherwise go to Mcdonalds if you want fast food."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is fantastic. I highly recommend the lamb but there are lots of great things to try. If you like trying new things. Get the all you can eat menu so that you get to sample a variety. The staff is great and extremely helpful in making selection suggestions based  on special dietary needs"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for a dinner out with family and visiting relatives, one of whom is a celiac. Riz caters to gluten-free diets and making it easy for the group to enjoy a variety of asian cuisines and without limiting the celiac to a small selection. They have a dedicated gluten-free menu but can also make a lot of the dishes on the extensive menu gluten-free.

I had a zen platter appetizer to start which is more ideal for two because it was a lot of food. There were taro spring rolls, a mango salad, mini veggie spring rolls and some rice noodles in the centre. It was missing the tofu satay that was listed on the menu and the mango salad was more lettuce than mango but it was all so tasty I barely noticed.

I decided to try to Vegetarian Pad Thai after scouring the huge vegetarian section. Usually I'm not a fan of Pad Thai but the Riz version was really enjoyable even though it was a bit scant on the tofu and veggies. I'd go back and try a green or yellow curry. 

The service was a bit intense and the ceiling is low in the restaurant making it very noisy. We had a big group so at times it was hard to hear each other, this would be the main draw back of this restaurant."}
{"text":"it's all about the gluten free.....

i really don't want to knock this place as i have had some very nice meals and even catering for a home party.

that said last wednesday i brought my once a week dining companion for the ayce thai. i eat gluten free and he does not. perfect restaurant.

except they poisoned me. some cross contamination, some error on the plating who knows. what i do know is i was sick for 2 days within an hour of eating here.

i will go back but i will also be very clear when they deliver dishes that they have to be more careful."}
{"text":"So I have been gluten free for more than half of my life. And Asian food is just one genre that is not gluten free savy. But Riz has done it. We had the tasting menu where we tried almost everything we could fit in our bellies. Our favourites were the fried calamari, the Korean BBQ beef ribs, the crispy beef, the fried rice,  and the satay. If you are looking for good fresh Asian food go to Riz. You won't be let down."}
{"text":"I'm celiac and have completely ruled out Chinese food for years, something that has been a complete pain in the butt for my family who are all totally obsessed with it. Finally got to Riz last night for dinner and tried a bunch of really great stuff! I would definitely recommend getting the GF appetizer platter, the sauce on the chicken satay is really delicious and to have a fried spring roll again seriously blew my mind. Then I shared the Vietnamese yellow curry, which was light and really spicy, something is definitely have again, and the coconut peanut chicken, which was a little too sweet but still really tasty! Coming back to do the \"All-You-Can-Taste\" gluten free menu for sure!"}
{"text":"Usually you go to an AYCE and no matter how full, you are left with this dissatisfaction in the quality of bland food and the boring menu and don't feel like returning, but not at Riz On Bayview. We love this place, a unique Thai AYCE concept (and an extensive a la carte menu) which is refreshing when all you can find is usually fusion AYCE that serve a few non-authentic Thai dishes. I don't see what the complaints about service are, the service here is great. They are  attentive and really nice people (the woman manager, and the less skilled in English but wonderful server). 

Now for the food, the food here is fantastic, flavourful, and come in MORE than generous portions compared to other AYCE's, so be warned, order bit by bit. The food also isn't sitting around in batches waiting to be served to you, it's cooked fresh as you order so you are looking at a little wait, but believe me it's well worth it. 

The ambience here is delightful,  huge windows and space between seatings, the booths are private and cozy without being claustrophobic, and lots of sunlight if you go in the day. 

Overall satisfied with the memorable dining experience and will definitely be returning back here."}
{"text":"Great place to go for fresh Asian fusion with large gluten free menu! Menu is uniformly good; food and service are consistent even when they are busy. Owner is usually on the floor keeping things running."}
{"text":"We went here for a Sunday lunch and the place was fairly quiet, and I had the crispy beef (as recommended by a friend). It was incredible. 

The whole damn lunch was delicious, from the soup to the rice, it was all amazing. I highly recommend you go to Riz right now. Stop reading other reviews or scanning for something else. Close your laptop, put your iPhone back in your pocket, turn off your iPad, or throw your desktop out the window and join the 21st century, then go to Riz."}
{"text":"I am all about this place. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Food has always been 10/10 they have a great selection. Everything from a regular diet to gluten free & vegan. Great for a group of people. The atmosphere is casual but really nice. Service is friendly, the food can take a little while to come to the table but it is always hot & fresh. I 100% recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered beef pho from Riz and it was the worst pho I've ever had. I could tell the broth was from a package because it was so salty and tasted nothing like real pho.  Now I'm going to nit pick: they also didn't include any bean sprouts, lime, basil, etc. I got take out from here, so by the time I realized that all I got was noodles, horrible broth and beef, I was already at home and couldn't do anything about it. I had a few spoonfuls of the soup and then was done.  My boyfriend tried it and agreed that it was awful.

If you do go, do yourself a favour and do NOT order their pho."}
{"text":"I'm at RIZ.  The atmosphere is nice with jazz playing in the background.

The place is immaculate and well taken care of.  The staff is over and above helpful and friendly.  The bathrooms are spotless.

I typically order the \"all you can taste\" gluten free lunch (or dinner).  That is what I am ordering today.  They offer both gluten free and normal food.

The menu is quite extensive, but today I am having the spicy Szechuan beans, green chicken curry, shrimp chips, chicken satays, and crispy citrus lemon chicken.

I love the satays and they are one of the only restaurants that I have been to that offers both spring rolls, and gluten free spring rolls.  They are also accredited (American accreditation)to serve gluten free food and have proper food policies in pace and separate driers and separate labeled plates for the task.

One of my top picks to go anytime.  The food today is as usual top notch.  Try the satays.  The sauce is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Small portions are perfect for sharing and the soup is beyond amazing!! So flavourful."}
{"text":"We ate here last night as a group of six. Service was friendly although a little confused at time (two servers helping us out, asked us same questions multiple times). We had a reservation for 6.30, not busy when we arrived but almost full when we left around 8PM. 

We ordered off the gluten free menu as one of us has Celiac and there were lots of options - huge menu! We started with the appetizer platter which was great, 5 or 6 different things and was scaled up for our group of six (server said it's meant for a group of four). I had fried rice as my main, the chicken and shrimp in the dish were great although rice itself could have been more flavourful. Everyone else enjoyed their meals, too; we tried the cashew chicken and some of the curries. 

Definitely worth visiting for a gluten-free meal."}
{"text":"This our Tuesday stop on the way to Bridge. Service is fast, and the food is fresh and tasty. The menu is less overwhelming than you would expect from a place offering  Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes. 

Favorites? A few ..  Soft shell crab roll, the lobster special, crispy ginger beef and when we have time, the all you can eat sushi.

Try to get the manager to take your order, the other servers are not always English speaking beyond taking your order and have trouble with complex instructions."}
{"text":"Riz has renovated, so the ambience is a bit different and there have been some changes to the space, including the addition of a few cozy booths.

My DC and I decided to try the made to order all you can eat menu ($15.99 per person on weekdays, $16.99 on weekends.)  The portions were small enough for us to sample many dishes, which was exactly what we were looking for.

The menu included soups, appetizers and wide variety of mains, as well as a few dim sum dishes.  I like that the har how and chicken sui mai came in a small steamer of 2, leaving room for other yummy things like shrimp spring rolls and mini Thai shrimp chips served with curry peanut sauce.

The chili cashew chicken was too sweet for my liking, but I did appreciate the reasonable amount of cashews.  The Thai curry fried rice had nice subtle flavours, with a good amount of shrimp and not greasy.

Too bad the menu does not include dessert.  There is a gluten-free option, but we ordered from the regular AYCE.  The serving staff was friendly, good natured and helpful.  Overall, a pleasant experience with good (but not fantastic) food."}
{"text":"SERVICE FROM HELL
The worst dining experience I've ever had in my life.  I went out of my way to dine here as the gluten-free menu options looked good on the website. Unfortunately, the reality was a rude awakening. The owner acts like a lunatic - she yelled in my face when I asked about the dirty cutlery and refused to apologize for her complete disregard for any professional courtesy. After I dared to request a replacement for a filthy knife set on the table, she slammed down plates of food (got the order wrong as well) and stormed away (not bothering to leave me with a new utensils to eat with).  Apparently she has a reputation as an unruly server?!  Wish I'd known before I went out of my way. The food was awful - overly salted and the ingredients looked questionable. The shrimp in my stir fry was rubbery and the mango slices were unripe and bitter. Disgusted and disappointed, I left the remains of the awful meal and trudged down the street in desperate hope of a last-minute replacement.  Verdi offered us a welcoming atmosphere and gluten-free risotto.  What a difference REAL service makes!"}
{"text":"A gluten-free paradise. I finally got to indulge in GF spring rolls, sugarcane shrimp. I was basking in the flavors. This place is awesome for takeout and to dine in (pretty small inside). I highly recommend the gluten free sampler and anything else on the menu. Lemongrass across the street is owned by them, also has a GF menu and is slightly more casual."}
{"text":"Great food with great service!

My wife and I had the thai spicy peppercorn lobsters and the Korean fried rice. Both were very flavourful, perfect if you don't like it too spicy.

The interior is charming and the servers were very friendly and attentive. Perfect place for dinners"}
{"text":"Complete garbage! Don't waste you're time staff is unfriendly and the owner is rude! Food is Sub-par at best and at ridiculous prices totally not worth the drive or the money to park. Won't accept debit visa and makes payment options impossible. Never again"}
{"text":"If you're gluten free and miss chinese food...........GO here!!! And go ravenous as the tasting menu was great for trying a few different dishes............the cherry on top was the wonderfully HOT hot sauce! Yummmm!
Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Pretty much a godsend if you have celiac. You get an ENTIRE menu of gluten free stuff to choose from, not just 2-3 items that are pointed out as being \"maybe okay, I think\" like a lot of places do.

They have dedicated fryers so you can actually eat awesome stuff like deep-fried spring rolls, bananas, etc. Stuff that is usually totally off limits, so it's pretty delightful to have such free reign over a gluten free menu. Lots of variety! The food is really excellent and portions are quite large for the price.

I've eaten here half a dozen times and never had any issues with cross contamination or anything of the sort. I bring my gluten-eating friends with me and they always really enjoy it as well.

The wait staff are usually quite polite and attentive. If you're lucky, you'll get Wendy as your waitress who is the funniest and coolest lady ever. She is delightful. I feel like she must be an owner or something because she is just so into her job, she must be somehow deeply invested in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered their Thai Red Curry to go and it was completely oily on top, the soup is very watery and doesn't even have a taste of coconut milk in it. No utensils were provided either. Would not order this from there again."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and fast. 
Food was fresh and full of flavour. We had the all-you-can-eat menu. Left stuffed! 
Best won-ton soup!"}
{"text":"The Best Gluten free restaurant ever!!

Everything on the menu is excellent especially the  crispy honey garlic beef strips! 

You won't find a better Gluten Free restaurant in Canada!"}
{"text":"This place makes me so happy. Anyone who's gluten free knows how much I missed general Tao chicken. Or for that case, most AYCE food. This place brought joy to my heart. Dishes are labelled GF so you know which dish is yours - if you're eating with folks who aren't GF. The all you can eat is pricey ($30 for the gf menu) but it's worth it for the first time you go so you can try a bunch of dishes. 

Their coconut peanut chicken is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Are extremely knowledgeable of gluten free diets. The food is amazing and the staff have amazing memories. They will remember you and what you ordered and are extremely friendly. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
