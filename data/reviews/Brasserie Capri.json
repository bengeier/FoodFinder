{"text":"Brasserie Capri seem's to be one of those hidden \"locals only\" places. We went with a small group of people on Sunday evening, they were clearly understaffed but apologetic for the slow service. The menu likely hasn't changed much over time - but they do know how to make the pork nuckle. One person called it French 'soul food'. Unless you're a regular, this is one of those places that you need to go to without expectations for speedy service, when she came, the waitress was friendly and supportive of our poor French."}
{"text":"No English spoken. Pig knuckles is insane. Delicious. With sauerkraut and boiled potatoes. Clearly a neighborhood bar. Old men drinking cheap wine. 

Close to burgundy lion, combine the 2."}
{"text":"Apparently you can't order things the way you want them here... some of our group tried to order poutine without the extremely cat-food looking beef...they were told they couldnt. Someone else tried to order vegetarian nachos and they came with bacon... The beer is cheap at least."}
{"text":"As a tourist, Brasserie Capri is not in the usual path of interests.  However, if you're reading this, you're probably interested in Quebec pork knuckles and you're probably thinking about going out of the way for it.  It's not actually a knuckle, but the shank portion above the foot.  It's braised in a slightly sour brine for hours until it's pretty much falling apart.  What you get is a lump that would have you wondering if you do have some cannibalistic tendencies, some boiled potatoes and kraut.

It is the most porky meal I've ever had.  It just exudes the robust flavor of the pig, the smell of cooked swine just radiates in all directions.  You navigate through gelatinous skin and fat to softened meat with simply a fork.  Gobs and gobs of pork fat and meat, tinged with a slight sourness of vinegar.  Bonus:  Suck that marrow out of the bone.  Glorious."}
{"text":"I've wanted to visit this place ever since I  saw Anthony Bourdain travel & food show Montreal episode. I must say I was a  bit skeptical at first on whether it is as good as it looks on TV, but my love for pork knuckles overcame any doubts I've had.

This place is full of simplicity and old traditions, it's a pub with a local diner atmosphere and an outside terrace. It's perfect for a quick bite to eat and to have some delicious food and drinks with your friends. It's very local, most of the regular customers are older gentlemen and some couples, but then again it was on weekday afternoon, so it's possible the crowd is different during the weekends.

Nevertheless, I fell in love with the place. The service was impeccable and quick, the atmosphere was warm, full of smiles and jokes and recommendations from other customers and regulars. The pork knuckle was simply delightful! I love hearty simple foods and this place was more than perfect for \"no occasion late lunch\". 

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to meet with friends, have some 'home-style hearty food' which can be heavy on a stomach (if you eat as much as I did) but easy on your wallet (the bill was also a pleasant surprise)."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was okay. It is what it is. But one thing I did not like about this place. they charge you 2.75$ for a can coke. We ordered a hamburger which was okay. pontine I really liked. It's  mostly a bar then I restaurant. Plenty of TVs to watch sports. But if you go here just to eat. forget about it. but to go here have a couple beers with the guys to watch a hockey game then it's not bad place. Unfortunately we came to eat. And got ripped off by the soft drinks again 2.75$ for a can Coke. But that was my fault they gave you free popcorn and you know the trick. salty popcorn makes you drink lol"}
