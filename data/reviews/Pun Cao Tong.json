{"text":"I love their food and dessert, chicken wings and the sesame seed seeet dunplings are my personal favourite and affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Have been going here for years. Desserts has been very consistent.  Can't really compliant about it.    I always get the stewed egg white with milk and red bean (sometimes with almond paste).  This is by far the best place in the GTA to get this dessert.   I have tried this dessert at pretty much every other chinese dessert place in the GTA and this place is the best.    The other desserts are pretty good as well.   I have not had a dessert that was not good here.   In terms of the food here... I would rather eat somewhere else and than come here for the desserts only.  I don't want to say it is bad... but not their specialty.     Definitely will  come back and will always recommend the stewed egg white with milk and red bean to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had the durian coconut milk sago and it was for sure a thumbs up! BUT, the service there was TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Nice little dessert place that stays open til 2 am. Came in a Saturday night around 10pm, the place was pretty crowded, but we were seated right away. We ordered the tofu fa, tofu fa with black sesame paste, and a black sesame paste. The black sesame had a really strong taste which is good because you know it was not made from the instant powder kind. The tofu fa was silly smooth. 3 orders came out to about $14 and change. Would definitely come back on my next trip to TO to try their other desserts."}
{"text":"Service was so slow, why cold desserts took over 25 minutes to serve is beyond me. My small bowl came out first, and I finished it. Then my friends came out after we had to ask when it was coming out! Looking around, others weren't getting their menus nor their orders taken. Saw a few people having to go up to the old waitresses to tell them in person because they were tired of waiting around unacknowledged. Desserts themselves tasted decent but not special. I've had better in other locations for the same price in bigger portions with much better service. Even as I was trying to pay, the waitress trying to cash me out wouldn't give me the tray with my coins, holding onto it with dear life it seemed. She was trying to say OH by the way tip wasn't included in the bill you know. Since when do you need to ask me for my tip like that??? So please, can I get the rest of my change back and let me decide on my own? It was all despicable. Won't ever return. What a waste of money, had a really bad evening out."}
{"text":"Came on Saturday night, ordered food and tea. We waited 1 hr and neither food nor drinks was served on our table.  The people came after us get everything they ordered. Complained to the owner once, we are being told in a very unfriendly voice that they only have one staff working in the kitchen.  We want to leave and they tried to stop us.... Will never come back again."}
{"text":"Several of us wanted to grab and go but decided to sit and dine instead once we saw the papaya with milk pudding. Alright, I was the one that wanted to sit and eat there because of the papaya with milk pudding. It took about 10 minutes to make but hey, in a cold day who wouldn't mind something warm?  Papaya with milk pudding: 5/5 (though the pudding could be a little smoother, it was a tad curdle-esque but at least the milk wasn't spoiled) Mango pudding: 4/5 (nothing exceptional in appearance but loved the heavy mango flavor) Coconut milk with sago: 5/5 (how can you go wrong with coconut milk?) Bird's nest with fresh mango: 2/5 (only got this cuz of the bird's nest but a friend commented it wasn't very good and diluted which I agree)  Bonus: the lady that was there was super nice and friendly and was also working alone, to which I applaud to because that is not some easy work!  I would say it's more of a 3 star but the nice employee really helped the place. Clean tables and welcoming decor is also a plus."}
{"text":"I was their regular customer. Every visit I order extra noodles & they charged me for $1.50-2.50 ( I forgot the exact price). A new girl served us tonight and she accidentally took our order wrong. I asked for instant noodles and they gave me regular noodles. They exchanged it for me. When I got the bill, they charged us 4 bucks for that extra noodles. Wtf????? This is ridiculous. Why would you charge me extra money just because your server made a mistake? This restaurant is a SCAM. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Once in a while whenever in Times Square when looking for Chinese dessert, we will come to this place.  We order durian on smooth bean curd - very strong smell of durian.  Walnut paste is not smooth as expected and it can be more sweet.  The taro in the Taro purple rice dessert is still hard and not blended well with the purple rice paste.  The best is the stewed egg white with milk in Papaya.  The papaya chosen is the best brand.  It is fresh and sweet together with the smooth milky egg white is one of a kind - highly recommended"}
{"text":"As a tourist, I think this is a good traditional HK dessert place. I have no problem with different choices on the menu. Most of the dessert place are seeking toast bricks, waffles, crepes.... but not these kind of dessert.  The black sesame dessert is not the best, but definitely not from instant powder.   Consider taste, environment, tidiness and choice of variety, I will give 3.8 stars!"}
{"text":"Huge selection of dessert here. The wait is a little long for the steamed desserts but it's worth it. I tried their steamed egg with walnut and it's just amazing!"}
{"text":"There's always room for dessert!  And I love Chinese desserts because I don't feel like I'm having something bad for me.  Chinese desserts can usually be classified as: * Soupy * Fruity * Custardy * Glutinous ball-like  Served hot, cold, or with some form of jelly or sweet rice.  Tonight, I wanted something warm, custardy, but not too sweet. I ordered the steamed egg white pudding with sesame paste ($4.50) High in protein and calcium, and black sesame is believed to be good for your hair!  The place is small and the decor is simple. Most people are drawn here for the extensive menu.  They have fancier items with bird's nest ($25) which is bird saliva that is supposed to make your skin beautiful.  Also, they have many items with Durian.  I'm not a huge fan, but everyone else was eating it up!...Except for one of my friends who I think wanted to kill himself because of the smell. :P"}
{"text":"Its a small place with TVs. They have lots of chinese desserts to choose from. I think they are pretty good so far, and their price is decent. They also have durian steam egg or milk that I don't see it from other chinese dessert places. It is very Hong Kong style too. I would recommend to my other friends for sure."}
{"text":"Love that this place is open later than a lot of the dessert places in the area. They have a very very long menu which is kind of confusing but I appreciate the variety. They offer almost every type of Chinese desserts, some of which sound very intimidating.   When you walk in you're immediately greeted with the strong smell of Chinese bitter tea, but you get used to it within minutes and don't notice it much anymore.   I've been here 3-4 times and have always gone for the fruity mango and sago desserts. Their sago is really delicious and depending on what toppings you want is around the $5 range. I also really enjoyed their mango pudding. I found it a little softer and creamier than some other places.   I find that both the presentation and taste is a lot better than some of the newer dessert shops that also serve sago and other Chinese desserts. It's also a little bit cheaper!  Note: they also have a small section of their menu for salty foods (noodles, rice, etc.) if you're not craving sweet stuff!"}
{"text":"I come here whenever I'm craving some light Asian desserts :) I usually order the tofu dessert!"}
{"text":"For a Chinese dessert joint, this is one of the smaller but better ones. There is a good variety on the menu, and even some nice set meal options.   We came here after dinner, so there were some parking spots available, but it does fill up at other times.   We decided to to go for Mango Sago Pudding and Fruit, Ice Cream, Boba, and Bitter Jelly in Coconut Milk.  Both were typical of where you'd get it elsewhere, but the fruit mix was quite different, with lots of different tastes coming together. The bitter and sweet together was quite good.   The only down side to this shop is that it is very small. Has about 6 tables that seat at most 6 people. Not the best place to go with a larger group, or when its busy."}
{"text":"I was hankering for some authentic Chinese dessert and dragged the husband along with me.   After some extensive searching on Yelp, I figured this is a good place to try out.   When you walk in,  the store is relatively cramped.   We shared a table with others.   I usually don't mind, but I didn't take into account that the girl sitting next to me had ordered a durian dessert (you either love it or hate it).  While I was sitting there, all I could do was try not to gag.   Their mango sago was $5.  Although they used fresh mangos, the dessert was quite small and the mangos were not ripe.   In a few spoonfuls, my husband finished his dessert up.     After my husband finished his dessert, about 20 min later, I finally got my steamed egg white with black seasame paste.   It was steaming hot and the portion size was decent.   That was definitely the tastier dessert of the two.   The atmosphere is loud, not because of the close seating, but because of the obnoxious TV show they were streaming.   It would stop at random spots and it was hard to tune out.     Now, I know it's hard to complain about Chinese restaurants for hygiene because it happens so frequently, I'm going to complain anyways.   The two waitresses were doing cash and serving.   One waitress used her bare hands to dress a dessert with fruit.   And I am quite certain, sitting next to their till (cash register) and hand washing station, that they did not wash their hands.      I liked my dessert and if someone were to go, I'd recommend the steamed egg white.   Personally, I think this place was an once and done type of place.   2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Space is small, we were back to back and I could feel the movement from those sitting behind us. When asked for additional bowls and spoons to share it seemed to be a hassle. Tofu fa was bland, and waitress failed to tell us one of the desserts would take a 15 minute wait, I feel that should be mandatory. Overall place is inexpensive and desserts were okay but would not come again."}
{"text":"This is the smaller, lesser visible (from the main street) Chinese dessert place in Times Square mall.  Food and drinks are consistent in quality, and quite good.  If you've had Hong Style Chinese \"dessert\", you know you will get a huge menu, breaking down into several categories.  I usually land on Essence Jelly, or egg whites/milk boiled in a papaya-half.    It's a small place.  Chinese antique style wooden stools are cool to look at, but not comfortable to sit on for long.  I get the point."}
{"text":"Pun Cao Tong is a pretty good dessert place with lots of traditional Chinese desserts/sweet soups. I'm also impressed with the variety of herbal and health-related desserts (such as their bitter herbal jelly) as well."}
{"text":"There is way too much stuff on their menu. They should focus on less items with better quality. We were very disappointed after coming here..  We had tofu fa and black sesame desert. Tofu was bland, and a big blob. Black sesame was very grainy and probably instant powder. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Very good! I highly recommend the purple rice with coconut milk, mango and grass jelly! It's perfectly sweet and creamy and the mangos were juicy and sweet. My bf got the mango sago but that was a bit tart, the prices here are very reasonable as I have been to other places before and they charge at least $8 for a bowl of dessert. They have a wide selection here so you can definitely find  something that suit your tastes!"}
{"text":"Pros: - This dessert place is more legit than other dessert houses. - Guilinggao better is better. The silky tofu had more bean flavor.  Rice balls w sea America and peanut was legit.  Cons: - We ordered a red bean drink and it was quite lacking unless you order it with coconut milk.  - Ginger tofu was very spicy"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place for Chinese dessert, however, I went 2 weeks ago and it was like a zoo.. I think the owners changed so everything tasted very \"different\", meaning it didn't taste like Hong Kong style anymore.  I ordered the simplest item on the menu and I had to send it back in.. I ordered a hot tofu pudding with black sesame paste, and not only did the tofu came out room temperature, it tasted a bit sour as I think that specific batch they made went bad throughout the day.  This never happened before, and the sesame paste on top tasted like instant powder mix; wasn't thick enough and the colour was rather pale grey than charcoal black. They were so disorganized that in the end they still charged my tofu pudding that had gone bad to my bill, when they promised to remove it. I had to repeat myself and reminded them not to serve anymore of the tofu pudding to other customers that same night.  I hope this place can recover soon because I used to like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for chinese desserts. I feel like a lost puppy in vancouver because I cannot seem to find any.. except Bubble Fruity that i finally managed to try a couple of weeks ago.  But in Markham - the options are endless - I asked my friend, and they know instantly... I'm such an Asian sometimes..  .. being super indecisive, I went to cancelling a UFC fight, to deciding to have BBT to last minute changing to chinese dessert - and thank goodness I did.  I came here based on my friend's recommendation on night 1.. and brought my parents here on night 2... i never do that - twice in one weekend, let alone twice in 1 month!  The first night - I tried the stewed egg with walnut paste. It took 15 minutes but it was Delicious. It was super hot and the egg was soft and creamy, with the nice tints of walnute paste submerged into the dish. We also got the mochi to share. I think it was made to order because it took quite sometime, but it was 3 flavours - sesame, coconut, and peanut. all equally good.  The next night, my dad tried the same as me because the whole papaya was sold out and he agreed that it damn good! My mom got the plain walnut paste while I got the black glutinous rice with coconut to bring home to share with my brother (he got the typical sago in coconut milk).  Everything is consistently good. Prices are decent and the options go on and on and on.... it was making my head spin. I guess it just means I have to come back and try something new next time!"}
{"text":"Pun Cao Tong serves up various bubble tea like desserts and iced drinks. There has to be at least 50-80 items on their menu and settling one or two yummies can be a challenge. I decided on the mango \"soup\" and an iced lychee drink. The mango dessert came with mango, tapioca balls, and shaved ice. The lychee drink was in a fountain glass with ice and lychee syrup. Both were quite sweet and amazingly refreshing on a May Sunday with the mercury topping 26c.  Seating is on low slung stools, ensuring you don't get too comfy. As the Boston poster (Go Bruins!) below noted, there's a flat screen on the wall showing some kind of Chinese drama.  Anyway, major points for the variety and the novelty. Parking is tight as its in the Time Square \"Mall\" complex."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese desserts! Lots of choices: herbal jelly, mango sago, steamed egg/milk, durian pancakes, sesame paste, etc. They were all good. They also serve hot food and herbal teas."}
{"text":"Most consistent good quality chinese dessert in the GTA. Love anything durian or mango that they have. My go to dessert is the steamed egg or milk with cashrew/walnut paste. Light and creamy every mouthful :P"}
{"text":"Tasted mediocre, on top of that they forgot half our order. If you're really craving asian desserts, it will do."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy chinese dessert place. Seats are limited and there is a good chance you will be dining with strangers because of the setup they have.   Tofu fa with black sesame soup $5 - not a bad combination.  Also tried the black glutinous rice with coconut milk. This also tasted pretty good.  And finally we also got the rice balls with black sesame filling.  Not a bad place to visit if you want something sweet late at night."}
{"text":"I found this little gem by accident.  I actually passed it several time without even noticed it.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the desserts and would look for a repeated experience the next time.    I think that they also have inexpensive food dishes and may give it try in the future."}
{"text":"Authentic Hong Kong Style dessert.   They have a great selections of herbal, drinks, sweets and savory items.  The Herbal Essence Jelly is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite dessert place to go to when I'm in Richmond Hill. They open later than other dessert places around the area. However, their menu is very long so you have tons of option to choose from. (It can be confusing and you'll probably waste a lot of time just figuring out what you want to order.) Besides dessert, they also offer a small selection of snacks.  Their dessert and snacks are delicious. For some of the desserts, I would prefer it to be a larger portion as for the price is a bit more expensive.   The restaurant is very small and tight. If you have a large party, your party will most likely be split up. Also, the wait for your dessert will take longer since they don't have a lot of workers."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I've learn about Pun Cao Tong from my coworkers who frequent this spot now and then. It is located next to my workplace in Times Square, so it is a good take out spot for me :) The menu is extensive, from the traditional Chinese desserts to snacks, iced drinks, and rice/noodle meal combos.  I have tried the Black Sesame Tong Yuen (Glutinous balls) in sweet ginger soup and they were delicious. This dessert is made to order and it really hits the spot after a nice meal.  I also really enjoyed the Fresh Coconut Pudding was light, creamy and refreshing. On the other hand, the Chrysanthemum Pudding with Dried Logan & Goji was slightly too herbal for my liking.  I always enjoy anything made with ginger... the spicier the better! Hopefully next time I can try their Ginger Tofu... sounds very spicy according to Marcia W. I am also very intrigued to try their steamed rice with ginger slices. Ginger always helps whenever I'm feeling under the weather.  I will definitely be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"Left this place v. satisfied!  We ordered the glutinous rice balls and passionfruit and strawberry sago.  You get 3 chubby rice balls - 1 peanut, 1 coconut, and 1 sesame. All are great but the peanut rice ball hit home with me. Not to get into micro-detail but the finely crushed peanut coating perfectly complimented the wonderfully chewy glutinous ball. It was so, so good.  The sago was so \"fresh\", and I say fresh not due to lack of better words, but it literally refreshing to have. Not in the same way the first sip of coke from the can is. It is \"guilt-free fresh\".  Because neither my partner or I are Chinese-speaking, we had to show our server pictures/point to the menu to order. Would never ding them for something as minute though. Awesome dessert place, definitely coming back, especially for that peanut rice ball."}
{"text":"This small little place is great for some quick authentic Asian dessert!    The service here is average, and the seating is not all that comfortable if you get the traditional stools, however if you're just having cold dessert, you'll be in and out.  They tend to take a little longer with hot foods, but it is worth the wait!  They always taste good, always consistent.    I wish they would clean up that little fish tank they have, poor little nemo."}
{"text":"First time coming here. The servers were super confusing when explaining the dishes to us and forgot couple items in our order. We waited a longg time for service, and they were just standing in a corner talking."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars   The shop itself is very tiny and seating is limited. Upon entering, the aroma of herbal jelly surrounds you and gives off the feeling of a very authentic traditional dessert shop.  Their traditional dessert soups are quite tasty. They have a wide variety to choose from, but most are either a hit or miss.  Their herbal jelly is quite pricey - $10 for a small bowl. Honey even costs an extra $1.20. The taste was quite good and the herbal taste was very prominent.  The biggest miss for this restaurant is unfortunately their dependency on using the microwave. Since my friend and I sat down, all we have heard was the constant beeping of their microwave. This simply means that they microwave and reheat all the dishes that they are serving.  The steamed rice rolls we ordered were also unfortunately microwaved. Very disappointed as the rice rolls were obviously microwaved even without needing to see it coming out of the oven. The rolls were too chewy and sticky and was not smooth at all.  Overall, I would recommend this place ONLY for their traditional dessert soups. Snacks and savory dishes are a definite miss. Not worth paying the price for microwaved food that came from a freezer.  If you want traditional and authentic Chinese snacks, then I would recommend going to Tracy's Dessert instead. Everything from savory dishes to desserts are delicious there and much more worth the price!"}
{"text":"Excellent asian desserts.  I especially like the boiled papaya with skim milk.  It takes time to make so you should call beforehand to order it first."}
{"text":"I love Chinese place for dessert! Why?? Because of the varieties in what they offer!   Pun Cao Tong Herbal is one of these Chinese dessert place I enjoy! There are such a huge menu of what to eat.. all I would love to try! Sometimes it is even hard to make up one's mind!  The dessert I decided on is the mango with glass jelly and black glutinous rice ($4.50). There are chunks of mango inside! Not too sweet, but nice and refreshing!  There are only 1 waitress working here on a Sunday afternoon, but the place is not busy.. The service is cold and indifference... wish she can say thank you and smile more to the customers. (I know it sucks to work on a nice sunny Sunday afternoon!)    I would be definitely be back again to try out other desserts! One good thing is for Chinese, some desserts suppose to be GOOD for us! They can give us better complexion and health. It is hard to believe, but this maybe just an excuse for me to eat dessert every chance I got!?"}
{"text":"Among the many Chinese Dessert restaurants around the Richmond Hill and Markham area, Pun Cao Tong is my go to place when I'm craving for some light dessert.  My family and I are  fans of their Tofu dessert as we feel theirs is softer than what other places can offer.  The restaurant is very small so I would recommend calling ahead or ordering as take out."}
{"text":"Ordered black sesame paste and it wasn't flavourful at all - kind of like ready mix sesame, \"instant\" flavour. We also had a taro sago and it was way too sweet. It is cash only btw."}
{"text":"The desserts were quite good, the menu was easy to read and mostly clear on the ingredients (except the \"baked\" chicken wings came out steamed) and the atmosphere is cozy. As expected from a Chinese herbal tea house. We were seated and served water with the menu promptly. I guess my main concern would be the service level - the employees were responsive and didn't offer much more enthusiasm than that. In particular, when it was time to pay, the server asked how we were going to pay for tips. the delivery and tone was a little uncalled for.  I would recommend to visit for the desserts but the lasting impression I have of the experience doesn't make me feel like going back."}
{"text":"this place originally started off specializing in herbal food/tea, then they started making desserts and snacks, later even expanded their menu to include smaller portions of rice dishes and noodles.  love their desserts there, from \"tofu fa\" (sweet tofu pudding) and steamed egg/egg white to glutinous rice balls and herbal drinks. their savory snacks are ok, too. service really depends--either they get too busy to be attentive, or the waiter/waitress doesn't know what he/she is doing.   bright side, they offer complimentary trash magazines and chinese tv for your entertainment, so even if going solo, you can sit back and relax there--if they're not too busy and need their table back for the next customers."}
{"text":"Lots of options! But some hit and misses.  ATMOSPHERE: As soon as you step inside, you're hit with the aroma - a mix of traditional herbal desserts and modern fruit-based or dairy sweets. It's a small little dessert shop, so expect a line-up on weekends. We were here on a Sunday night, so had to wait a little bit. Not too bad though. Tables are small, and some are placed side-by-side to form one long table - so expect to be seated next to strangers. We lucked out and got a table for our party of four.  SERVICE: Service is fast and courteous. On our visit, our server spoke Cantonese and English. Another server spoke Mandarin. Most clientele spoke Canto or Mandarin, but for those who only spoke English, the servers were very patient and explained the extensive menu.  PRICE: Average. The basic Chinese dessert soups ranged from $4.50 and up. They do have fancier dishes (like bird's nest) that would be over $20. But most people would probably order items in the $5-$15 range, which would include all the basic dessert soups, puddings and fixings.  FOOD: As mentioned at the beginning - lots of options here. We each ordered something different...  Hokkaido Milk Pudding - Great presentation, using egg shells to hold the pudding. Flavour was good. Comes with a little (very little) scoop of Neapolitan ice cream.  Walnut Steamed Egg Pudding - Great consistency and flavours. Crowd favourite.  Mango Sago Pudding - Good. Standard, chilled and refreshing.  Black Sesame Dessert Soup - Very disappointing. I'm a BIG fan of black sesame. This is a standard in Chinese dessert shops - and if you can't do this one right... that says a lot. Their version was lacking in flavour and the consistency was much too thick. Two thumbs down.  Black Sesame Dumpling - Good. Nice texture and flavour A HUGE contrast to the item above! Which made the dessert soup taste even more bland in comparison...  Overall, it's an OK place to chill with friends. But just be weary of which items you pick from the menu - some are great and others will leave you disappointed."}
