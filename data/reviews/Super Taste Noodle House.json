{"text":"Crazy nice ramen. I came here for the second time just to make sure it was not by chance. Beats a number of more expensive and pretentious noodle houses. I will check other items on the menu in the near future."}
{"text":"Several new restaurants have recently opened in Bridlewood Mall. We like to check them all out and have tried this one a couple of times, which opened 2 months ago. We are foodies and are always on the lookout for fresh and tasty food. This place exceeded our expectations. The service was fast and very friendly and the prices surprisingly reasonable for what you get. We shared a large bowl of Mapo Tofu noodles with yummy pork pieces. (7.99) which comes with a delicious egg drop soup with corn. This place has the best fresh noodles we've ever tasted! The spice is just the right amount of flavour without burning our mouths. We also had some calamari (1.99) and lamb (3.50) skewers. The barbecue flavour was delightful! And, my husband came home from work tonight, after he'd stopped in here again for takeout!! I highly recommend this restaurant, with a menu different than other Chinese places, for the best homemade noodles you'll find in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Traditional Chinese style hand pulled noodles are okay. Beef was tasty but a little hard to chew. If they add more vegetables to side with the noodles they could make a better balanced meal."}
{"text":"Would probably give 0 stars if the option was available. I had to wait 20 min just for them to acknowledge that I was there, and another 20 min after I ordered just for them to ask me what I had ordered again. Absolutely atrocious service, food is awful as well, would NOT come back."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and we generally found the food under-flavoured.  I ordered the noodles with spicy cumin lamb sauce (not the stir fried version). It was not spicy at all nor flavourful enough. I guess it's great for people who are looking for more subtlety in their food, but I think what makes this type of Chinese cuisine great is the abundance of spices.   Some positives: 1) portion sizes were very generous, even for a small serving of noodles (could've been shared between two people!) 2) my dad had the #1 (Langzhou soup noodle, I believe it was) and the broth was clear and tasty  3) the cumin lamb skewers were delicious and not too fatty  I would stay away from the noodles with sauce, and the stir fried noodles. The soup noodles were decent though!"}
{"text":"It can be hard to get away from all the salty, carby, oily ethnic foods that Scarborough has to offer but this little noodle shop does offer some delicious hand pulled noodles with a more home made taste.  Came here with my parents on a Saturday just after 1pm. To our surprise we were seated immediately. My dad ordered the braised beef Ramen with regular noodles, my mother ordered the seafood Ramen with sliced noodles and for myself I had the special linzhou with wavy flat noodles. All were $7.99 for the small bowl.   I have to say the broth was clean tasting and had a great flavor with tons of depth and not overly salty or over used msg. I can actually taste the beef broth with light sweetness.  It did not come oily as some of he other similar noodle joints have and must say the noodles were very good as well.  My mother and father both liked their dishes as well. Might I add the braised beef did come with chili oil on top.   Overall I think this a great option for noodles if you find other places oily and heavy. If you are someone who likes the soups with more flavor,  more msg than I would move on as the soup may be considered bland for some."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited here for a late night dinner around 10:00pm on a Friday night  We ordered 1 calamari skewer, mapo tofu on rice, and seafood udon.  the seafood udon was meh..since I requested no cabbage, the only ingredients left were shrimps and calamari..no onions or bean sprouts.  the mapo tofu on rice had quite the kick..but was oh loaded with salt.  I don't agree with the cost rating for Super Taste, I would give it $$ and not $.  slow service as other yelpers have commented.  can't speak to their hand pulled noodles...may attempt a visit in the future to try their hand pulled noodles..but won't hold my breath.  Agree with Jennifer K. based on her review of Super Taste."}
{"text":"Overpriced and so salty. My tongue was tingling due to the crazy amount of MSG in the broth. Had the pork and pickled mustard Ramen. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"The first thing that gave away that this restaurant was pure horrible was the Squid in Sizzling Plate that we ordered. On the menu, there is a photo of the dish which was a big squid on a hot metal sizzling plate. When it came, it was NOTHING like the photo at all. No sizzling plate, just normal plastic plate. Squid doesn't even look like the full squid in photo, half the size and hardly any tentacles unlike the photo. When we tasted it, the squid tasted like it was just boiled and then they slapped some sauce onto it. It doesn't taste like it was grilled or has been on any sizzling plate AT ALL. I've had this dish at many other Northern Chinese restaurants and I know for sure it's not supposed to taste like this. Talk about deception here. Same with the grilled tofu we got. Next, we got the Kung Pao Chicken with the wavy noodles. The noodles taste like the packaged ones you can buy from supermarkets. We also ordered the Nutritious Lamb Ramen noodle and we chose the hand sliced noodles. This is by far the worse hand sliced noodles I've ever had. Their noodles here just taste like strips of dough. Not like how hand sliced noodles are supposed to taste. The soup base itself had no taste whatsoever. Almost like water with a bit of seasoning and mild taste from them putting the meat in. I wouldn't recommend this place at all to anybody."}
{"text":"honestly this place was not good. We got the Beef and vege ramen and man were they plan. It tasted like all they added was salt. They had such a selection of menu items so we were excited but it turned out not good. The service was good, food came quickly and everyone was nice and helpful to help us decide. There's not alot of vege options maybe 5 in a menu of 30-40. The prices at least we're good, nothing over $10."}
{"text":"It's okay, average at best. The handpulled noodles are not bad but feels like it's lacking something, soup and meat could be more flavourful. We also tried their stir fried pork with peppers which was pretty good but wayyyyyy too salty. We also had this squid hot pot but the squid was tough and barely had any flavour."}
{"text":"Went with my family one day to try it out, when we walked in, it was pretty empty. We ordered 2 noodles and a grilled tofu and squid on a hot plate.   Service was pretty slow for a place that was basically empty.   Firstly, the squid on a hot plate did not come on a hot plate nor did it look like it was cooked on the grill or anything (like how places usually do it). Secondly, it was a super super small squid piece nor did it come even close to what they had pictured it on the menu. Not to say it did not taste good, it tasted like it was boiled quickly to cook and then had some sauce added on it and then pan-fried. Super unhappy for what we got for the price we paid since: a) it was nothing like the picture b) it was unbelievably small   The grilled tofu was just okay. Not memorable.  The 2 noodles we got were not good at all. We got one that was \"hand cut noodles\" but to us it just tasted like big pieces of dough because the pieces were \"cut\" so thickly and they were really long for what \"hand cut noodles\" should be. Super unhappy and unappetizing. The soup base for it was really bland. We had it with lamb and it was done poorly in which you could taste the unappetizing taste that comes with lamb when you don't cover the taste up. The other noodle we got was a bit better, but it was still not worth it for what you pay. It was super oily and there was nothing special about it.   I definitely would not go back. It's not worth the price. You don't get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Super Taste Noodle House is tucked away on Bridlewood Mall between a few restaurants. It's easy to miss and not really on the main streets. It is accessible through the mall. Not really that busy.  They offer a variety of Lan Zhou style dishes, which are typically spicy. But you can ask for non-spicy. The hand-pulled ramen noodles are freshly made and there's a window for you to see them stretch it out.  The food was just okay. The fried ramen was a bit on the oily and salty end. The portion wasn't big - pictures can be deceiving. But the prices were cheaper than most places. You can't expect $8-10 per dish at any other restaurant nowadays. Overall, it's good for a quick, cheap eat."}
{"text":"Bridletowne Mall has been making some serious development lately. First they added a Phoenix Chinese cafe, then a Yamamoto All You Can Eat sushi place. Now they have this, Super Taste Noodle House.  Unfortunately Super Taste was far from super. The only reason my friend and I came here was because it was 10% for opening week (or whatever it was).  It was really busy when we got here and we were put on a waiting list. A list where they just grabbed random receipts to give me a number three. We waited about 10 minutes and got a table appropriate for us as we also had a stroller.   The noodles seem to be made in house and the texture is not bad, but as I ordered a bowl of \"Traditional Lanzhou style beef soup ramen\", I'm not sure the legitimacy of this traditional noodle, but it didn't look very impressive to me. Just looked like a bowl of soup with some noodles, a couple slices of beef, a fried egg and not a whole lot of spices. Not exactly something I wanted to pay $8.99 for.  My friend ordered a beef rice bowl, it was pretty tasteless and she had to put a lot of soy sauce on it. It probably had about 2 portions of rice in the bowl and the rice was soggy. I mean, it's good that they have non-noodle options, because not everyone likes or wants noodle, but at least get it right.  Service was mediocre, the server who was processing our bill, pressed $2.51 instead of $25.10 on the debit machine.   For the prices they charge, I don't think we'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"New restaurant in bridlewood mall.  The modern decor and spaciousness of the restaurant let's you sit comfortably.  Lots of booth, and colour scheme is pretty good.   It wasn't too busy on a weekday, ordered a bowl of braised beef soup ramen, a beef and onion ramen (with corn soup on the side), snack size deep fried tofu, and 2 lamb skewers.   The size of the ramen are quite decent, i got the small size, and couldn't finish it, but they don't ask you what type of ramen you want. If you don't specify they will give you the normal ramen.  The fried tofu was really good. Sauce was good, and not bad for 2.99. The lamb skewer was 3.50 for two, and we're nicely seasoned, not too salty, but was pretty spicy.   The ramen was not bad, they give generous amount of beef in my braised beef.   We sat in a booth where one side is a wall, and the other side is where you get into the booth. It bothered me that the waiters and waitresses brought the food on the wall side.  Knocking over my chopsticks and tea cups.  I had to move everything out of the way because they were holding a bowl of noodles, and I didn't want it to spill on me.  It wasn't busy, and just like 5 more steps to walk around and serve me on the correct side of the table.   The other thing is they have an open kitchen.  I don't think the chefs really care that it's opened.  I saw them eating with their hands, then going right back to making ramen. Then another time I looked up and they were eating sunflower seeds, and spitting out the shells onto their hands, then continuing with their cooking.  I can't imagine how the closed part of the kitchen might be.  Eek.  So besides the service and uncleanliness of the cooks, I would have given 3 stars."}
{"text":"I always worry about restaurants in malls.  Too much envisioning food courts, I guess.  I had a couple of my staff with me, and we needed lunch while working in the area.  Lots of Asian offerings around, but this was downright close by.  Surprisingly, the food was pretty good!  A bit on the spicy side, and overall not very North American, which made it even better.  I had a big ramen dish with a rich broth and decent selection of other ingredients.  I wouldn't feel bad about stopping in again.  The noodles were very good, although I discovered they don't survive staying in a take out container until dinnertime."}
{"text":"very blend noodles?expensive?and the meat skewers holy?10 tiny pieces of meat the size of your finger nail for 3.50?No thank you?definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"A-OK but VERY SLOW SLOW SLOW...........  The food were decent, portions were pretty good (a lot of noodles) for small size, and taste weren't bad. However, the service was very slow. 1. we waited for some time for the noodles to come, so if you are in a hurry, maybe try somewhere else 2. a jar of tea for 5 people, we opened the lid for more, but the waitress passed by 5 times and she didn't notice the lid was opened and no tea for us until I actually asked for the tea and the bill. May 1 person is better because you have a jar of tea for yourself 3. I asked the bill and put down my credit card, but no one wanted to get the payment. we waited for almost 10 min, so we just put down the cash and left. What a great service right?"}
{"text":"Overpriced low quality food. There are plenty of places that offer better quality of Chinese food and services than this place.   A meat dish is like 95% random vegetables and 5% meat. Really slacking on the food but bragging in the menu"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and enjoyed the ramen. I live across the street, and being that it's Victoria day, I wanted to sit down, and just have some beers. The waitress told me that I couldn't just drink beer. I look around the tables, and 2 of the three are just people drinking beer. I point this out, and say \"how come they can but I can't?\" She replied with \"these are old customers\" I say \"well I'm an old customer, I've eaten noodles from here countless times\" I even recommended the place to friends , and had taken them there, also my girlfriend, and mother I've taken there for Ramen. Yet she just gave me a blank stare, and wouldn't serve me. Not to mention, she was being very rude about the whole thing. I'm a nice person, and I feel like I was treated unfairly. I won't be getting food here ever again."}
{"text":"Hand Pulled Noodle at Super Taste is not super or tasty enough for a special visit especially with so many similar noodle places opening up in Scarborough.  Arriving for a late lunch at 3:15 pm might not be the best idea as the kitchen was having a late lunch just like me. After I placed my order, it took more than 10 minutes before kitchen staff ready to make my noodle. I don't mind the wait but I personally think if you open through the day, it might be better for business and customer service if staff takes turn to have breaks.  Open Kitchen might not be a good idea if a business not having a really clean and hygienic kitchen. I tried not to watch and stare while they preparing my food as less I know the better it is.   The food tasted not bad. Noodle was cooked al dente.   I don't think I will be back unless I am shopping at Briddlewood Mall. But why would anyone shop there?"}
{"text":"I am not sure why, but the lunch experience gave me a less than stellar feeling overall.   Maybe because the services was super slow (waitresses stood aside and chit chatted).  Or maybe the food was oily.  Or maybe the booth seating was uncomfortable.  The fact that the hand pulled noodle tasted decent didn't save the day.  I walked out thinking I wouldn't return for sure."}
