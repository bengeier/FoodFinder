{"text":"Best pizza I've had in the GTA.

I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. Well finished. Spacious dining. Not your typical pizza joint but well priced."}
{"text":"South Etobicoke (south of Gardner) has a lot of pizza shops to select from. Pizza is average at best, inside is a typical pizza joint."}
{"text":"Super yummy. You can really taste the home cooking behind this family joint. You can't beat the price either :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for sometime now and I don't know why I never wrote a review. Their pizzas are always fresh and tasty. You get awesome tasting food for that price. It's my goto place for weeknight dinners. Their soups are hearty and healthy, my favorite is the minestrone soup. I love their garlic bread with cheese too. The owners are very friendly and generous."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! 
I just spoke with the \"chef\" to give him feedback, his response- \"don't order again, we don't need your business\".
You know the saying 'pizza is like sex, even when it's bad it's still kinda good' well this place has proven that wrong.
Inedible pizza, wings and garlic knots.
I've never been so disappointed with food.
Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Each time the food has been great. Pizza, wings and garlic knots are all great. The prices are quite reasonable for the food quality you get."}
{"text":"The best pizza on lakeshore (mimico) and hands down the best meatball sandwich in the city. I can see this place from my balcony, they are open late, and I eat there at least once a week. The business is owned by a really nice Italian family and everything is homemade at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Alas, I'm a little disappointed with my first delivery from Calabrese after my somewhat glowing review of their slices. 

The price is great ($20 for an extra large, two toppings, 3 garlic knots, 2 pops and 1 terrible dipping sauce). But sometimes a cheap price reflects quality. 

I believe in the holy trinity of good sauce, cheese and the importance of a good, springy, yeasty crust. It was the crust in particular that let me down, a little too bready... Think of late night, hurried homemade crust. 

It was definitely edible and for the value, it's a three star joint.  But I'm moving onwards to find my go-to West end pizzeria."}
{"text":"Best chicken parmigiana, Greek salad and bruschetta with cheese ever.  Ordered delivery and was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place left a bad taste in my mouth without me even getting to eat there.
I just called to ensure that the promo available on Yelp could be applied to delivery and the guy told me only if I bought it before, not if I bought it today. So I can still spend the $15 to purchase it but I can't use it for food. How the heck does that make any sense when it's still available for purcase? I guess I have a souveir of this stupid experience.
Potential long term customer lost over $15"}
{"text":"I go here sometimes if I'm really hungry, however it's not the most fantastic pizza around so I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I find it to be way too thin and quite cardboard-y if you don't get a slice with a lot of ingredients on it. However for the price it's pretty acceptable. It's a family owned place by the looks of it which I can respect but nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Updating to say we tried them again on the weekend, and again were very disappointed. The food was inedible.  Toppings on the pizza were wrong. Wings were covered in sauce when we asked for none. We threw out an entire pizza and a pound of wings. No more chances."}
{"text":"Delicious pizzas and best creamy garlic dipping sauce I've ever had! Overall friendly experience for me."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. My fianc√© and I order from this place EVERY Friday and we finally have had enough. The customer service has always been a bit spotty but tonight takes the cake. We ordered at 730, which took 10 minutes (normally 2) because the guy taking our order was SO slow. I had to then call 4 separate times to find out where our order was and it showed up at almost 10pm. Not only did it come over 2 hours late, but it came with no wings and half the garlic knots and no one called us to inform us. The driver told us it only took him 10 minutes to get here yet 45 minutes earlier they told us it was out for delivery, and it showed up cold also. Not to mention one of the times I called the guy just said \"hello?!\" and didn't even bother to say the name of the place so I had no idea if I called the right number. You would think also that after calling 4 times they would have told us they \"ran out of wings\". Calabrese you have just lost a weekly customer. The pizza quality in no way out weighs the wretched customer service or 2+ hour wait time, order from pizza pizza instead"}
{"text":"Alongside IL PAESANO the best pizza in the west end.  Friendly family shop.  Great walk in specials; medium and large, very affordable."}
{"text":"I hate giving a bad review, but when I ordered they showed up late, the bill did not make sense or reflects the prices on the menu, they just rounded it up to $45 , The guy on the phone was rude, I've ordered from them from just eat and it was cheaper and the food was great... So I'm not complaining about the food although they did forget my drinks:( I think I'll just order from Just eat then deal with them"}
{"text":"Oh man was this place awful.  I ordered from the maybe a month and a half ago, and just getting to review now... I got a pizza with pepperoni, bacon and I think beef... But it was just... So terrible. Barely any sauce, thin, dry... I got chicken wings from there as well, they were pretty massive, but bland bland bland.... The honey garlic sauce that came with them, were bland as hell also... Super disappointed, buyer beware."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Love the walk in special. Two medium pepperoni pizzas topped with fresh garlic for under $11."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza and for such a great price. The walk-in specials are a great deal. Definitely a hidden gem and one of the best pizza joints in this area."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Wednesday and gone this pleasantly delicious! You can tell this is a place where they make fresh sauce that is homemade. The dust is crisp and fluffy and the balance for the toppings us evident. They do use more spices and blends than the average pizza places. So I can see some people not liking that but I personally think they got a great slice!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times for pizza. I usually get the walking special.

Overall I think it's a great value. It's not the best pizza I've eaten however for the price but it's very good. Also when compared to other local pizza places the pizza is very similar in quality. This place is located close to where I live so I continue to go back. I would not drive out of my way to go to this place."}
