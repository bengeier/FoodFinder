{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and watch out Starbucks, their coffee is better. I bought a couple dozen for the office and everyone loved them. Also, the owners are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Saw this in passing on my drive down 90th Street, and I'm so glad I stopped. So good, I went two days in a row! Friendly staff/owners, the best bagel, cream cheese, and tomato sandwich ever! The Churchill a must get! Great simple menu."}
{"text":"The place is fabulous. Everything so fresh and tasty. Coffee drinks that put anything made by a chain to shame. Friendly personable owners. Great atmosphere. Just wish they were open at least one weekend day. Love it!"}
{"text":"Tried out the semi-new coffee shop which is located in an area in-between North and South Scottsdale that could use a name (NOSO?). Now, the name of the bagel shop was much better as they did clearly have many bagels on hand and an array of toppings to pick from. The friendly couple asked how my day was going and then I got steered towards a fig bagel with cream cheese and apricot jam (my choice). I think it has a name, but can't recall, but all the ingredients were tasty enough. The jam is not homemade. My coffee also hit the spot with the cream being behind the counter. Small patio looks good for cooler weather, but I was inside watching the world go past through a big window."}
{"text":"OMGosh... so good! Try the Churchill and you will not be disappointed! It's not only delicious, it's local and the owners are wonderful. I'm putting this on my favorites list!"}
{"text":"Great way to start the day.  Good coffee, pastries and bagels.   Nice new \"find\" in the way to work.  Tony is very friendly and great service"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, kickass bagels with some good coffee. What more can you ask for? I would go out of my way to come back here if I ever find myself in the mood for a great bagel."}
{"text":"Wow!  The best bagel I've had since living in AZ...seriously delicious.  Very \"East Coast\" style.  This will be our bagel stop from now on!"}
{"text":"How can something so simple be soooo good?! Had The Churchill - everything bagel, chive cream cheese, heirloom tomato topped with lemon pepper. So fresh and so good! Adorable new spot, will definitely be back to work and hang out. 

Awesome service too, the guy I spoke with this morning was super friendly and helpful. Can't wait to support this neighborhood business."}
{"text":"This place is quite nice. Simple, mom and pop type bagel shop and cafe. They make everything fresh. Coffee is real and strong. Bagels, croissants and scones are on point. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went there to patronize a local establishment rather than a chain and boy, was I delighted. 
Decided to get the Churchill (seems to be a crowd pleaser) and it was love at first bite. 
Worth every pence (if you will) and glad to see they are in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great spot for a bagel and awesome dark roast cup of joe! Friendly staff and the price is affordable. Definitely will be back :)"}
{"text":"This is gonna be a short one. Just had my first breakfast here and it was amazing! Service was very friendly and genuine.  The bagel was an everything toasted with butter and blueberry jam. They have apricot and strawberry too.

The food: the bagel had a nice crunch on the outside and really soft interior. A back east bagel if I ever had one (I'm from NJ)  I also had coffee with a shot of espresso and it was as good as can be. Not bitter at all.

Verdict : great new mom n pop shop and I'll definitely be back. Take out menu is coming next week I'm told so keep watching this space!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, great service! I only had been here once before and they remembered me! The bagels are great! They have some outside the box flavors I had a peanut butter banana bagel with the \"blackbird\"'toppings which was cream cheese and blueberry jam. Everything was fresh and tasty! It is cute and relaxing inside as well. They have coffees and fresh smooths too! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wandered in for breakfast and had a complete flashback to 1988. I went on my semester abroad to a college in the same neighborhood where the owners lived. And the music playing was a song by The Church from 1988. But down to business. The Churchill was amazing. Lovely combo of the cream cheese, heirloom tomato, lemon pepoand everything bagel. My iced latte was very good and kept me alert all day. Looking forward to my next visit. 

Patio is pet friendly. Here are two satisfied customers."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time.  Was in the mood for an eggy breakfast but there was no egg breakfast on the menu.  The owner put together the egg salad on an everything bagel with havarti cheese.  It was freaking delicious.  The bagel was crispy and soft at the same time, the everything seasonings were perfect, the egg salad was just right.  The espresso was great too.  My mouth and stomach were so happy.  I'm not in Scottsdale often, but when I am this is my new daily breakfast."}
{"text":"If you haven't visited The Brilliant Bagel...you are SO missing out on THE BEST local owned place in town! Tony arrives at 4am to roll his own bagels, create his own specialty cream cheeses, lemon curd with pistachios (my favorite!!), sandwiches, coffee and tea and the intimate list goes on! Tony and Kathy have created a space that is welcoming and casual with great music!"}
{"text":"Came looking for a breakfast bagel. Didn't realize it's a meatless establishment. I did get a great iced americano though and the gentleman working was really nice. Just don't come here looking for a more traditional breakfast bagel sandwich but some of their meatless combinations do sound delicious - for me, I'll save this place for meatless Monday's and amazing coffee vs a meal."}
{"text":"I like the location of this bagel shop.
I give it 3 stars because of a very important thing - the flavor of the bagels. The flavor could improve significantly and the bagels are a little tough to chew. Those are the big improvements I would suggest. 
Otherwise, I think it's a great bagel place."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale, AZ to see my very sick sister in the Mayo Hospital. A family friend(Chrissy Pacheco) delivered a huge load of bagels, croissants, muffins, etc... Everything we received was absolutely delicious!!! I would definitely recommend the Churchill bagel! It is a fantastic blend of flavors and cream cheese topped with a green tomato. I could eat that every day for the rest of my life and be completely content! That's not including everything else we tried... EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My coworker brought in a dozen bagels from The Brilliant Bagel and we had a little sampling of the all the crazy flavors. Hand downs, the banana peanut butter was the best! The flavors weren't too over powering, just delicious. The sun dried tomato was also a fan favorite. 

My coworker said that the owner was super friendly and the inside was adorable. Definitely going back!"}
