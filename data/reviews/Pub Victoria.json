{"text":"Atmosphere, drinks, and service were very good.  However, the smoked meat dish was low quality. I enjoyed my caesar salad but that is difficult to mess up.   I would recommend it for meeting friends for a drink but not if you would like a meal."}
{"text":"The four stars is for the location and beer. If I were rating this on food alone, I'd have to give it 1 or less! The outside terrase is a lovely spot to poke away to have a few beers during happy hour or a nice warm evening. Myself and my fiancé shared some nachos and jalapeño poppers. The nachos were just chips with a jar of salsa thrown on top and a mountain of mozzarella cheese. No veggies or anything redeemable about those. The guacamole was from a package which I could have guessed. The poppers were just regular ol frozen ones. So, go for the beer, go somewhere else for food! Although I'm sure it would be fine if you were half in the bag!"}
{"text":"Perfectly fine for a 5a7 (happy hour), but nothing that special about it. Typical pub range of beer and liquor."}
{"text":"I really like Pub Victoria for their beer selection, and proximity to my office in the Old Port of Montreal.  There is a limited liquor selection, so only go here if you are in the mood for a beer.  Food wise, their prices are on the high end for what you get.  But due to the locality of the bar in relation to the old port of Montreal, of course the prices are going to be high.  I especially like the 5-7 special where you save a whopping $0.40 per beer...cheap asses.  But, hey, they have a great selection of beer not common in Montreal.  They also have a large patio (aka terrace in Canada), where you can sit outside and enjoy your pub fare and spirits."}
{"text":"Pub bien situé, non loin de nombreux bureaux autour de la station Square Victoria. Il y a une grande terrasse à l'arrière, très agréable en été. Excellent service, bon choix de bouffe et de boissons!"}
{"text":"Différents plats de brasserie comme les saucisses et la choucroute ! Ce midi, il y avait au menu, un feuilleté de canard, un gratin de crabes, ...  Le service est rapide, on se demande si les plats ne sont pas préparés d'avance ! J'avais pris un hamburger simple, la viande était bien cuite et les frites étaient bonnes. Le gâteau au fromage était bon aussi ! On ne m'a proposé que le gâteau au fromage. Pas de cartes de desserts apparemment ! Les prix sont très honnêtes.  Mes notes : Ambiance : 6/10, Service : 6/10, Nourriture : 6.5/10, Propreté : 7/10, Rapport Qualité prix : 7.5/10 Ma note globale : 6.6/10"}
{"text":"I am in Montreal for a couple days for meetings (the company I work for is based here) ... I flew in this afternoon.   I didn't feel like going too far for supper and came across Pub Victoria on Rue Notre Dame Ouest. I like pubs and it looked interesting from the outside.   It wasn't too busy when I got there about 5:30pm but a few people wandered in as I was there.   I started with cheese sticks ... nothing outstanding about them. They arrived very quickly after I ordered them (too quickly) so I'm assuming they'd been made ahead of time.   There wasn't a lot of choice on the menu so I ordered a burger and fries. Not great. The fries were overdone and it seemed like the burger was warmed up rather than cooked freshed for me.   My server was efficient but a tad cold.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"The bruschetta appetizer is a must !! A nicely presented, generous and flavourful delight! The bread is fresh and soaks up the tomato toppings, shaved Parmesan. Delish!"}
{"text":"Jeudi 24 octobre 2013  Une belle fin de journée, après ClasseTechno. On décide de se rendre au Pub Victoria pour se retrouver entre amis. En entrant, on reconnait le pub typique, un peu sombre, très très bruyant, plus ou moins occupé mais en plein remplissage du jeudi. Si vous ne savez pas trop quoi prendre, commencez par un bon cocktail... une limonade maison avec Vodka. Délicieux ! Votre drink sera compté comme une sangria BL ... ??? Si vous avez faim, pour vous ouvrir l'appétit, il vous en coûte 9,75 $ pour 10 ailes bien ordinaires, rien de comparable aux ailes de Casey's !  En gros, l'ambiance très très bruyante vous arrache la voix pour le reste de la soirée. On s'ennui du Royal Merchant qui a bien compris l'organisation des lieux.  Thursday october 24th 2013  Nice afternoon and end of a good TechnoClass event. We decide to stop by the Victoria Pub. Coming in, nobody greats you in and you pick your place in a mildly dark but very very noise place, seems typical. If you don't know what to drink they can prepare a very good fresh made home lemonade with Vodka. It will be charge as a sangria BL ... ??? beats me !  Hungry ? if you get wing, it will cost you 9,75 $ for 10 ordinary wings with ordinary BBQ sauce. Nothing like the one's at Casey's !  In the end, the ambiance is very very noisy and strucks your throat with a nice voice loss at the end of the night. You start missing Royal Merchant very soon."}
{"text":"I dont know about the food but i can tell about the hidden terrasse in the backyard with song of birds.. for a litlle drink ;)"}
