{"text":"Great spot for a quick and solid burger. I absolutely loved the steak burger, and their fries are also really good. All the food is halal too!"}
{"text":"As I was walking down Bay Street, me and my boyfriend discovered this burger spot. I ordered their shrimp burger and I was super impressed by the quality of their burger, I tasted real bits and pieces of shrimp in the patty. My boyfriend ordered a steak burger (I obviously had to bite into it) and it felt like I was eating a juicy steak, the meat tasted cleaner because they use quality halal meat. The staffs were super friendly! Definitely would be back again!"}
{"text":"great vegan burgers and sweet potato fries! and excellent value. will be back here soon"}
{"text":"This new place opened where Jack Tans used to be. With the amount of burger joints nearby I was wondering if they were any different. Long story short, new ideas and poor execution.  I ordered the steak burger combo. The burger itself was high in price already, that is why I got the combo. The burger was a mix of meat and grizzle. Grizzle shouldn't be found in any burger. The combo overall wasn't very big. I did like the gravy though on the burger.  The place overall needs work."}
