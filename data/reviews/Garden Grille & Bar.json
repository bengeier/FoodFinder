{"text":"Amazing hotel food. Especially the omelette which is better than stack's omelettes which makes the 10$ already worth it. The other food was just about average but the omelette are 10/10"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out...and I will never go back again.  I had the butternut squash ravioli, which showed up looking and tasting like a tv dinner that was not fully cooked.  It was almost cold, and  the cream sauce was like water and had no flavor.  I would have rated this meal one star, but my boyfriend had the ribeye which was slightly better than my food.  He said he rated it a 3 out of 5 but he wouldn't go there again either.  

The atmosphere was also strange.  There was only one other group of people there besides us, and the restaurant is right next to and somewhat open to the area where they perform weddings.  A wedding was just ending, and all the guests and wedding party were standing around in the restaurant area.  It was an awkward setup and the food left a LOT to be desired.  For what you get....way overpriced.  I've had better meals at Taco Bell, so this was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We ordered a couple times during our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. Each time they forgot to include our second side item but they corrected it and sent them right up. My husband ordered the NY Strip (rare) with mashed potatoes and saut√©ed veggies. He literally said it was the best steak he has ever had because it was cooked so well. I ordered the Calypso Chicken Club with fries and it was great! The chicken was charbroiled and I could taste the grill marks! Excellent food!"}
{"text":"By far, the best hotel food I've ever had. Hands down. The atmosphere is very modern, chic, I loved it. Jimmy, the bartender, was also our waiter and he was fabulous. He was very personable which I appreciate. The food was AMAZING. Please, do not listen to the old reviews posted here. I'm very picky when it comes to my food and it's very rare when I have no complaints; and I have none with The Garden Grille & Bar.

My husband and I both ordered the NY strip with mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was cooked exactly how we both ordered, not chewy, and extremely tasty. The asparagus was fresh and cooked beautifully. My daughter ordered chicken strips from the kids menu and I managed to snag a bite before she devoured them. It was really good! My son is only 2 years old, so we ordered a simple (or what I thought would be simple,) Mac and cheese for him. 

Let me tell you about this Mac and cheese. It's made with three different types of cheese and it is delicious. I would order this for myself if it wasn't on the kids menu! Myself and my husband both took *a few* bites of this ha!

Then it was time for dessert. Gloria, the restaurant manager, and Jimmy, presented us with perfectly plated cheesecakes and a fantastic brownie with ice cream! Even though we were stuffed from dinner, of course we had to have all of this! Hey I'm on vacation so I will indulge a bit :)

My family and I plan on making annual trips to Arizona from California and you can bet we will be returning to The Garden Grille & Bar!"}
{"text":"Had a 12 oz ribeye for $14.95 and it was great. Cooked perfectly. I'm not generally a Dan of hotel restaurants but was impressed with thus on in the Hilton Garden Inn. Friendly service too."}
