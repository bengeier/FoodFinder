{"text":"AVOID AVOID AVOID

The only reason they are still in business is because they have a VERY large drunk clientele from the club area on weekends and some week nights

 I live close and go here sometimes bc its open really late weeknights.

firstly the people who work here are about as RUDE as you get. They act like you are bothering them from watching their tv shows as soon as you walk in 

the shawarma is dry, the vegetables are so basic and not ripe. onions are cut SO thick that they overpower the whole sandwich. 

they charge EXTRA for tabouli !!! actually extra for anything that isnt lettuce, tomato, onion and hummus. 

to top it off they DONT EVEN GRILL THE SANDWICHES. they wrap it and serve it to you with a grunt."}
{"text":"Naz's is a relatively quick-stop, late-night Middle-Eastern spot in the vibrating heart of the Entertainment District. You eat here because it's late and you don't want to wait for a burrito. Or you're right there and feel like a shawarma or fallafel. You don't go out of your way for Naz's. You do however, walk right past the shawarma place on Duncan and Queen and go here instead. It's certainly worth the 1 1/2 block walk. 

That's not to say Naz's won't hit the spot because on occasion, it will. But I can guarantee it won't knock your socks off. If it does I would look into that. That's a bit strange to have your socks just come off like that. 

The shawarma is better than the fallafel is better than the spinach pie is better than the baklava. The salad however, is solid.

Ah, shawarmas. The food of university days gone by and late nights out.

It's been ages since I've had one, and the other day I decided I needed a little variety from my normal diet of burrito lunches (I love you, Chipotle, but I need a little space!).

Naz's was the one place closest to work, where I could guarantee success on this front.

The place was empty, except for one other guy sitting there, so I was guaranteed swift service. (Perhaps I just happened to get there during a lull? Or perhaps it gets more business late at night with the club crowd? I dunno.)

The chicken shawarma I bought was tasty, had just enough spiciness, and was decently priced.

The only quibble I had was with the woman who works at the counter, as a couple of my fellow Yelpers mentioned a while ago. She was great with my order, and got it in a decent amount of time (since no one else was there). But SO stone-cold. 

I could understand her stern expression if the place was packed with hungry lunchtime customers, OR she had to deal with drunk party-goers late at night. But it was around 1 p.m. on a weekday afternoon, and I was stone-cold sober and polite. Despite this, she was stone-faced. She only softened her iron facade when (people I presumed to be) \"regulars\" came in to orders. 

That's fine. But it's a little unfair, especially if you **want** to become a regular. Do I have to come in every day for that lady's expression to soften? Because I didn't get much encouragement. Looks like my next shawarma excursion might be to Quick Pita a bit farther away. Sorry, Naz."}
{"text":"We had been walking back my friend's work from the waterfront cruises when we stumbled upon this place. She tried the beef shawarma while I had the chicken. Hers was great but mine was bland. I found that it lacked flavor and had to put a lot of hot sauce to make it taste good. She insisted that their other dishes are better but I have yet to try. I'll surely be stopping by to give this place another shot on my next trip to Toronto and update my review."}
{"text":"Naz is a hidden gem in a sea of touristy restaurants on King, Queen and John. If you are a tourist and looking for inexpensive food, yet healthy and wholesome, Naz is the place to go. For $4.99 you get a huge Chicken Shawarma that is packed with several veggies and great sauces. A Must try place to eat."}
{"text":"Naz was SO rude!! It was like she didn't even care to serve me even though I was her only customer. Small portions and high prices....way too much salt. Never going there again! Yuck. Don't go there!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry kids--Naz's is no more.  \"FOR LEASE\"  I tried to go last night.  It was a great spot to grab a quick bite before a show at the Scotiabank.  I was introduced to it when I was working on Spadina, back in 2010-2011.  Too bad, so sad."}
{"text":"Very good food at a fair price. Skip the lettuce and do chopped up Falafel instead on your shawarma. There are tons of Falafel houses in TO but I will probably stop here again."}
{"text":"Of course, this place, if I was just giving stars for its prices in downtown Toronto - five stars. It is dirt cheap for alot of food. I cannot argue with that. I have to admit even I was surprised.

After reading a plethora of reviews of Yelpers who have tried this place and given it more stars than me , I say, cool. However,  most were based on ordering Falafels. Understandable since it is a Falafel house but I just don't like those little balls. 

Ordering was quite the event. She took and prepared my order while on her cell phone. She was kind enough to set it down when I was being asked the sides for the shawarma plate. 

The veggies were wilted and had the colour equivalent of a beige wall.  Equally as appetizing. For the ridiculous price, it wasn't half bad.

Though it has unwanted decor from some bygone era, would I go back again?Maybe. Yes, it's at price point where you can't help but go back."}
{"text":"This is another in the long line of eateries that I can thank my friends for the introduction to.  Again, another lunch hit us, and someone in our posse said, \"I know a place.\"

Strolling in, the place is very plain to the point of bare.  Very few fixtures, counter service only, a smattering of tables and chairs that appear to have been lifted from a sports bar patio in a side room make this pretty plain.  But the line-up began pretty quickly.  Falafels, donairs and the like are the specialty here.  I went with the chicken shawarma and as you'd well expect for a \"place your friend vouches for\", wasn't disappointed.

I looked around the place, though, kind of disappointed that the place was so drab and plain.  Then I remembered the location as well as the hours of operation.  Ah.  Gottit.  Club Land.  Late late late night.  Drunks.  Hungry drunks.  Hade the breakables.  Here's another tip, don't look at the logo through the corner of your eye.  The apostrophe can play tricks on you."}
{"text":"Falafel was fresh. That's a plus. But the taste was unfortunately bland and the texture was too mushy for my taste. The other ingredients were good."}
{"text":"The food: I came here for a chicken shawarma and it was pretty good.  The chicken was moist, the fixings were fresh, and they had the obligatory sign of authenticity popping out from within: the pink turnip (other variations I've seen of the turnip are a dill pickle).  Granted, my idea of shawarma perfection is the shish taouk at Boustan's in Montreal, but I realize that's asking for a lot (and for an established Lebanese community in Toronto)

Naz's, like many other doner/shawarma/falafel places, are not exactly known for ambience or decor.  When you walk in you're overcome slightly by a cloud of grease, but when you get over that and chow down on your shawarma, somehow that disappears.

Bottom line: If you're in the neighbourhood and want something cheap and pretty yummy, come here, otherwise not worth making a super long journey."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much the opposite of a falafel connoisseur and my experience with Middle Eastern food is limited to my frequent visits to Naz's - they seem to know what's what. If you want a cheap and quick lunch option then this is a good, no nonsense bet. 

The lady (mom?) who works the counter has a perpetually angry look on her face, like she pooped her pants but doesn't have a clean change of undercrackers, but don't let that scare you away. She's just concentrating on blowing your mind with an amazing falafel.

She'll serve you up a trio of crispy falafel balls in a pita, load it up with tzatziki, tomatoes, lettuce (or in my case, not) and those weird pickled beets and wrap it up tighter than you could imagine possible."}
