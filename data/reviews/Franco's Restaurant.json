{"text":"I got stuffed banana pepper appetizer and steak with Gorgonzola. My wife got spaghetti ala Norma. Very well cooked and good flavor. Great and quick service. No problems for me except it is located in an old Eat n Park type building. Might turn off some."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to eat at Franco's at the last minute on New Year's Eve.  They were very accommodating with a reservation and seating, and the service was excellent for a very busy night.  The meal was top notch.  We had a fried zucchini app which was the best I've ever had.  I had the Virginia Spots and my friend had stuffed salmon.  Both were delicious.  The salad and dessert were also great!  I will definitely go back - expensive but well worth it."}
{"text":"Despite making a reservation days in advance and arriving 45 minutes early to enjoy a drink (read: spend money) at the bar, our group of 4 waited 30 minutes past our reservation before giving up and leaving. The bartenders were friendly, and we were excited to try the food. However, the hostess (who I suspect is one of the owners/owner's wife) seemed more interested in drinking, socializing and seating her friends than in honoring the reservations of other guests. There were multiple parties of 4 who arrived after our reservation time and were quickly seated. The hostess was well aware that we waiting and assured us multiple times that we would be seated in \"just a few minutes.\" After telling us this the last time, she flat out ignored us and avoided coming anywhere near us. In the meantime, the bar became crowded, loud and uncomfortable. When we couldn't get her attention, we simply decided it wasn't worth the frustration and left.  This is not acceptable treatment of customers, especially customers who have a reservation. We will not return to this restaurant and will advise others not to waste their time."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Italian-American joint. You know the drill.  I had the linguine pescatore with marinara sauce. The seafood was plenty and fresh. The marinara sauce was not bad, and the pasta was cooked properly al dente. I also had a salad with bleu cheese dressing (GREAT dressing) and a french onion soup, which was also yummy.  The food was good, but I felt Franco's was extremely overpriced. I spent about the same amount here as I normally do at Dish in the Southside, which has some of the best, most authentic Italian food I've had in the States. Bottom line is I don't think it's worth paying $40+ for a meal I could easily make myself."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a woman at the door, very friendly who tried getting me to eat in the bar area, I declined. I ordered Veal Parmigiana , it was off the menu but I was told it was $25.00, I asked for spaghetti noodles instead of the tubular noodles (my preference). I was told that it would be an up-charge, thankfully I asked how much and was told $5.00, I declined. The woman who greeted me at the door came by to ask how things were going and I confided that I was disappointed that I could not get a side of spaghetti, and that the $5.00 was a little much. She told me that this was their policy, I later found out that she was the owner. This soured what would have been a fine meal. Pasta is cheap and I have never been asked to pay that much to get a small side of spaghetti substituted."}
{"text":"Excellent high-quality authentic Italian cuisine....terrific menu. Best of all the other Franco's!"}
{"text":"We thought that this place looked kind of nice from the outside as we drove by at night so hubby and I stopped in for dinner.  It wasn't busy so we were seated right away.   This is an Italian-American restaurant and although we saw the yelp reviews, we wanted to try it out for ourselves since we are new to Pittsburgh. We found that the food choices were adequate but kind of overpriced for a place that really wasn't that nice inside.  Our server wasn't very attentive but I am rating the food.  It gets 3 stars.  We don't think we'll be going back."}
