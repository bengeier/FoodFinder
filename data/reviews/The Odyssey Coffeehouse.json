{"text":"As a student of SAIT, I spend a lot of time in this coffeehouse. It is your typical coffee place: coffees, teas, baked goods, and some meals, like sandwiches and grilled cheese. They sell waffles on Wednesday's for breakfast and the prices are reasonable. 

The food and drink are nothing special, although I have really enjoyed every soup I've had here. They serve their cold coffee drinks in a cardboard coffee cup, which I have always thought was a bit strange. They should be in plastic cups! 

Anyways, if you're just looking for somewhere to do some studying or to just chat with some friends, this place is great. It can get pretty packed around lunch time, so it's best to come before or after, although they are only open until 4 and close even earlier on Fridays. 

They usually play some relaxing indie type music, have a TV, really comfortable seating, and even a patio for summer days. This is definitely my go to place to catch up on school work on the SAIT campus!"}
{"text":"The coffee brand, which escapes me, tastes like absolute swill.  The food prices continue to go up year after year, yet the service and food quality go down every year.  It used to be a fabulous place to go, but the choices made in the operations and the unfriendly staff keep me from sitting down and relaxing environment.  The TVs used to play news in the morning now all we get to see is sports highlights--It is not customer focused it is what the staff want to watch."}
{"text":"I only ventured here to try their YYC Hot Chocolate fest drink and I'm glad I did. Odyssey has a great atmosphere of study and quiet conversations. I never found it too loud and I loved their music selection. A bit of oldies, featuring \"I Want Candy.\""}
{"text":"The Student Association coffeehouse on campus - quick food and lots of room to sit, with friendly staff and warm meals.

This isn't the most impressive caf√© in town, but for a busy tech school, it's a nice change from the other fast food joints on campus. The menu has decent selection for both breakfast and lunch, with both ready-made and made-to-order options, as well as a full-service coffee bar. Each day has a different special that will save you a few bucks on your meal a well, which is pretty nice.

If this place was anywhere except on campus, I'd rate it a 3 or 3.5, but because of the relatively low cost and the fact that it's a Student Association business rather than a franchise, I'm giving it a 5 star review. Take the time to check it out if you're needing a coffee or a quick bite when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Superb macchiato made with great care, perfectly textured milk and excellent Phil & Sebastian espresso. I don't go to SAIT- in fact I'm a U of C professor- but I'll make a point of stopping here more often. Quite possible the best coffee in NW Calgary. SAIT people- you're blessed to have this on campus!"}
{"text":"Location is wrong on the map!

If you've been a student at Sait this is a premo study spot chill music ability to grab coffees. The food they have is good little pricy but not gunna kill you so that's friendly and yea honestly it's just a nice chill place read a book work on a project grab a coffee befor school!"}
