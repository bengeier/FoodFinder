{"text":"They deliver almost as promised.  I got two hot dogs, a pretzel, and a regular soda for $8 plus tax.  My only issues were that the hot dogs were smaller than expected and there were no refills on the soda.  The hotdogs and pretzel (and mustard) were delicious.

Overall, for the price on the strip it was filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite! Tastes just like you bought it on the streets of NYC! Cheap, fast, and delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite to eat at a cheap price, sure, go ahead. Otherwise, you'd be better off going to Earl of Sandwich. $7 for a bratwurst and it really didn't taste like much at all."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs this side of New York prices are great come get a taste"}
{"text":"If you enjoy microscopic mediocre hot dogs, then this place is for you. Costco's hot dogs are better and sell some called \"Caspers,\" that will rock your world.

I'm shocked this place is still in business with the crappy product they are selling. A normal sized bun with an anorexic hot dog in the middle. Save your money and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"$2.50 for a NY dog with sauerkraut and brown mustard. 

There's really nothing more I can type about this place. We've all had a hot dog, you know what you're getting every single time. Plus, if you're stopping in here you've likely been drinking and need cheap, quick food. This is a good idea."}
{"text":"Good cheap eats! Fast Service !Love the Lime a Rita's !!!!"}
