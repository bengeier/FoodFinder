{"text":"I always wanted to stop in this  diner but never had a opportunity until recently.  The menu is very creative.  Look on the wall first! I ordered the chili cheese burger.  I was really disappointed with   The meal.   The burger and chilli didn't compliment each other.  Don't order it.  I also tried The chilli dog and that was delicious.  They got the old school French fries.  The people are very friendly,  the setup of the diner was a new experience for me.  Cash only,  \"I couldn't find a letter\".       This yelper is a fan of , fruit, and veggies"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas! Don't live on this part of town, so I decided to stop in when taking a course at the CSN campus nearby. Best decision I've made. The portions are generous, and the prices are ridiculously cheap. It's tradition for me to take friends and family there now. Great place"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a good place for breakfast for quite some time and we just found it here at the Maverick Truck Stop. The place is small and definitely not fancy, but that is what one would expect from a hole in the wall like this. The food however is unexpectedly good. The portions are large and the prices are small. We will definitely be back to this new favorite."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  The service was excellent. Loved the signs on the walls.  Went in for a cheap breakfast and got a GOOD, cheap breakfast.  I was, however, not a huge fan of their chocolate milk OR hashbrowns. Sometimes I wish shredded hashbrowns were ILLEGAL.  If you want a sit down meal for a few bucks, go here. It's obviously not fancy, but the wait staff is so bored they HAVE to check on you."}
{"text":"Love the old truck stop.. so much history and lots of story telling from the elders.  Great food and good people. BEST chili cheese dog in town.Sara is the manager and is amazing and always on top of the other services."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is the true blue truck stop hidden behind Wendy's.   Yellow and red placard on the wall announce all the specials and another sign lets you know that they have homemade macaroni and potato salad. All the tables and booths were filled with truck drivers.  I imagined Large Marge coming around the corner any second.  They have an array of cheeseburger sizes and the 1/2 pound we got seemed enormous.  The prices were beyond reasonable. It was a true blue truck stop cheeseburger served up by a sweet little old lady.  The fries were nothing spectacular and the side salad I had was good.  I  will return, if for nothing else to experience a true americana experience.   I will be back again for some rib sticking biscuits and gravy and apple pancakes."}
{"text":"Im giving this place one star because of the service. The food is really good and very reasonably priced. When my husband and I walked in we were not greeting by any of the 3 employees. Keep in mind this was our first time. So we assumed that we seated ourselves. The waitress who's name was Kennedy walked over, placed the menu's down and walked away. They're were 3 other customers there who I believe were either her friends or family that she continued to talk to and laugh with. When she came back she said \"what do ya'll want to drink and eat.\" We told her and she walked away again and continued what she was doing before. While we were waiting for our food she called across the cafe and said to my husband and I, \"if you're wondering what is going on, i have a really huge crush on the guy that just walked out.\" I believe the guy she was referring was another employee. My husband and I looked at each other and told her we would like to take our food to go and went ahead and paid. When we recieved our food she never once said thank you or have a good night. I'm use to people being rude in Vegas but we have never experienced such bad service"}
{"text":"The grilled cheese sandwich was amazing.  And cheap!  The truckers here were friendly but, holy crap, do they have some sad stories to tell.  And they will talk to anyone who will listen.  CASH ONLY.  But really, what did you expect."}
{"text":"Good basic American food generous portions very feeling nothing fancy and the best thing inexpensive."}
{"text":"Well this place is a typical dive joint. Still being said they could do better by having the waitresses keep their taco bell and Starbucks cups of coffee lying on a table in the middle of a resturant and making that area there unofficial brake room lol. The food was meh... it was cheap though, 6.95 for Patty melt and tea. The waitress was attentive but I will definitely never come back to this joint unless I Wana take a shot on the breakfast menu. I'm a sucker for good biscuits and gravy and that have that here. But skip this joint, seek your burger needs else where!!"}
{"text":"Very bad service and food was absolutely horrible. My mom and I went from a suggestion from someone. Mistake dirty, unfriendly and just basic cooking easy breakfast skills lacking. Friend said maybe she went when it was a diff cook. Will never chance that again. Just don't go."}
{"text":"I got 2 pancakes, and hash browns for $3.25! The food was amazing, it is family friendly, and it has the best service i have ever seen/had in Vegas! They need money so please give them big tips."}
{"text":"This is a no frills truck stop/ diner. If you're looking for a place that serves good food on the cheap this is it. I had bacon, eggs, hash browns and biscuits and gravy for $5.75. AWESOME! . You can't judge a book by its cover on this one because honestly mavericks isn't much to look at.  But they are serving great food at awesome prices.  So if you're in the neighborhood and your stomachs growling stop in and enjoy."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!:) great service and yummy food!!! Have been going her for years and never have had bad food yet. :)"}
{"text":"Only been here twice, the first was a few years ago. Decided to pay it another visit last week and I forgot how good the burgers were. The Service was good, Waitress seemed to know everyone who walked in the door. The ambiance reminds me of burger joints i use to go to as a child. I had the 1lb burger which was awesome! My girlfriend had their chicken wings and fries which were also surprisingly goood! Bottom line, if your looking for a laid back, good old fashioned spot to enjoy good food, Maverick's Truck Stop is it!"}
{"text":"They are open til 8 but they choose to refuse service at 7:30. That sux. Plus sign outside says open til 9.  But overall food is ok. Great, casual diner atmosphere makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Portions on the large size.  If you are looking for a place for pancakes, Mavericks is for you."}
{"text":"Chili burger was gross.........Chili must have been old and lacked flavor. The bun was not fresh either. The french fries are crap. The service was decent."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot ever!!!! It needs to be remodeled, but the prices and food is worth it!!! It feels like home!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and I've never been served anything I didn't like. Yeah, it's a total dive, but it's a charming little dive. Plus, their cook rocks. Good food, CHEAP, and consistent.   Stuff I've tried: Biscuits and Gravy Eggs (scrambled, omelet, over-easy, and sunny side up, all good) Sausage (if you see it, TRY IT - homemade and delicious) Grilled Cheese (also with ham) Hash browns Corned beef hash Onion rings Texas toast  Really, you can't go wrong. Also, take note - they're cash only."}
{"text":"how can u go wrong here.  great food, large portions and small $$. service is good and friendly.  Lots of regulars have been coming here for years.  white board specials and about 8 or so $3.25 - $4.00 breakfast specials. check the pics for what we had."}
