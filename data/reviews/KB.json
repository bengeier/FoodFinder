{"text":"We had been wanting to go here for a while as it came highly recommended by friends. We decided to take a chance. Do not go here without reservations. We did tonight and we were placed at the hightop table right by the bar. The large overhead TV flashing down on our table playing the food network. The phone ringing behind us the server having to pass by to grab cutlery..all annoying. But even more annoying was feeling rushed through our meal, the burnt chicken tacos, and the lack of caring on the servers part. When as how i enjoyed the meal i said it was okay except for the burnt parts I could not eat and those pieces were black the server replied with \"oh\". The dessert menu was tossed on the table...both my husband and i chose the coffee creme brule which was amazing but we were never asked if we wanted coffee or tea before he ran off to get the dessert. I would have rather been told at the door that reservation are required on Saturday nigh and have gone somewhere else...then be treated  the way we were and rushed out the door...huge fail kb!"}
{"text":"I went to KB to celebrate a late Mother's Day. First visit there and decided to go based on rave reviews from friends. Drinks and appetizers were served and were great. Main course was served and I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. It came out all steamy, hot and I took off the bun to put some aioli on it and what crawled out of my bun? A spider. I was shocked and quickly took it to the waitress to show her. They asked if I wanted another sandwich and I said yes, and to be honest with you that was my mistake because when I got my second sandwich it wasn't piping hot as the first one, hardly had any lettuce on it and even my fries were not hot anymore. I truly think they used my same sandwich where the spider had come out of and just re-served it. I try hard not to think about what I ate or why a spider came out of my sandwich. I was offered a free dessert on the house which shocked me even more because due to the situation my meal should have been comped. I will never step foot in that restaurant again. I have never in my life had that happen to me and I still try not to think about what happened. So beware when you eat there what might come out of your food."}
{"text":"Wow !!! La nourriture est excellente, menu spécial et vraiment succulent. Une endroit a essayer et un incontournable a Oshawa."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. One of the best restaurants in Durham."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Burger tasteless.  Waiter did not bring my change back.  8$ on a $31 meal is a bit much.  Great drinks, maple whiskey sour,  good coffee and desserts which were too pretty to destroy. Great staff.  great atmosphere but the menu and food was disappointing.   Very clean and cheerful."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  What can I say...great food, great variety of food, great staff, and nice dining environment.    The variety of food and regular changing menu are my favourite things about KB's.  The staff are excellent and well-versed on their changing menu items.    Great place to take friends and family for a nice night out...definitely a must try and definitely a hidden gem.."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Food was awesome, casual and lively. Made reservations and was seated promptly. We will definitely go back. The food was great, nice selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant in the heart of Whitby. Great food with wonderful ambiance. Friendly and attentive wait staff  Really liked the Flat Iron steak with mashed potato, fiddle heads and crab cake. Menu features local and organic ingredients and is changing constantly  so you can keep coming back for new finds.   Good selection of craft beer on tap as well as various other libations. ."}
{"text":"Wow! The food was amazing. Delicious meals made with local ingredients with an ever changing menu. Dessert was to die for. Excellent service, our waiter was excellent and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Outstanding catfish and tasty braised octopus in ragu sauce. They are a must try! Staff were very friendly as well and great service!"}
{"text":"It would be difficult to recommend KB on the strength of a particular dish - I've never seen a menu that changes so often!  However, because they make the effort to change the menu to suit the produce and meat available, you're probably going to enjoy whatever dish you do order.  The restaurant is very central to downtown Whitby and I've never had an issue finding parking.  The interior is a bit eclectic... it's modern and hip, but also has some odd murals painted that detract from the overall look.  It's unique, but not as professional as the rest of the restaurant.  Service has always been good, and a few servers are really excellent.  We've been recognized after only a couple of visits.  We've also been for brunch - excellent choice if you're sick of the standard brunch faire other restaurants offer."}
{"text":"Great food and selection went for a business meeting and had a great meal. Had the burger with fries. KB is a welcome addition to our downtown core"}
{"text":"As Whitby natives we have been to KB a handful of times now. The service is always top notch. The staff is friendly and accommodating. We actually had a chance to sit down for a drink with Kevin one evening and get to know who is behind everything.  The food at KB is definitely in the upper tier of Durham region. We recommend the duck liver plate. Delicious."}
{"text":"Went to KB for the first time on recommendation from friends.  I read the reviews and overall KB had received excellent reviews so I was keen to go and try the food and service. Overall - excellent. They are a farm to table restaurant which means the menu changes with what's available. We had to the cheese plate, home made pickles and the herbed frites to start. All of it was yummy. The pickles were perfectly pickled and fresh, the cheese selection was balanced with the wine. You can select up to 3 cheeses for $20. For our mains we both had the Walleye which I was happily surprised to see it in the menu-you don't see it often! Lots of flavour from the rice, asparagus and Spicey purée.  For desert we shared a crime brûlée.  There was a wide selection of wine and well priced. Cocktail and digestif menu was eclectic. Overall the menu was varied and very interesting. Something for everyone.  The service was top notch our server was very helpful and genuinely excited about the food we were looking at ordering. When the server was at the table we had Her undivided attention.  I can see how there could be issues with service as there were not enough servers to take care of the tables in a timely manner.  The service was excellent but just not enough staff to compliment the quality of the food.  We were there on a Friday night at 6pm-ish and it was fairly quiet but within 40 minutes the place was filling up.   I would definitely go back for dinner and drinks. My tastebuds would be happy"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little hidden gem.  Followed them from the Burb's in Pickering.  Casual dining.  The food is excellent with a regularly changing menu.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I have eaten at KB a few times while in the Durham region. Everything I tried was better than expected! Duck liver pate, burger, chicken tacos were all delicious! Overall, pleasantly surprised by everything they have to offer, from food to service. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday. Great food, good wine, excellent service - I will definitely be back. Love that the menu constantly changes to feature seasonal/local ingredients! And that they have options for vegetarians :)"}
{"text":"We are new to Ontario and from BC.  KB'S concept of farm to table we absolutely love as it reminds us of the west coast .  Food quality and service is fabulous.  We will always come back!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place except....FANTASTIC! I love how the menu changes according to local and in season produce/products all the time, not just once in a while.  The first time My husband and I landed in this cozy place it was by total accident, and thank goodness we did!!  Not only have we been back there several times but we have brought my husband's entire family there for a family celebration.  I can't say I've even had a mediocre meal there, every single thing I have ordered has been amazing and you can see the passion for the food in the finished product.  The service staff is what makes KB's go from a 4.5 to a full 5 plus ***.  Every person that we have encountered there seems to absolutely love their job and shows it to every customer they greet!!     Keep up the amazing work team KB."}
{"text":"The food at KB's is the best part of the restaurant. They have a lot of locally grown food - meat and vegetables. The atmosphere is a casual setting with very professional staff. The server really knew the menu well and could tell us where the food came from which was very cool.  I stepped out a bit and tried the Maple Smoked Cheddar ( $7 )with home made crostini. Then a burger with cheese and a sweet mango barbecue sauce that was incredible. It elevated my burger ( $14 ) into the \"great entree\" status.  That came with frites.   No dessert, I had to go back to work."}
{"text":"We enjoyed two great Friday night meals at this very nice restaurant with top notch quality menu choices and friendly staff. The homemade liver pate is my suggestion to start with along with one of the many cheese choices"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was friendly. The wait staff missed an item we order but corrected the oversight quickly. Went to celebrate a birthday. Received a chocolate brownie cake, with candle for the birthday guest. I will return."}
{"text":"OMG. Delicious. Your taste buds will thank you. Warm and welcoming staff. My kids loved the food too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came for an early dinner one night on a friend's recommendation. Because it was early were were seated right away and basically had the place to ourselves.   The service was superb. I have never met a waiter that was so friendly and engaged with us so well. He was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and very helpful with making our selections. Unusually for us, we got both a starter and a dessert.  We started with the aracini rice balls. They were fried perfectly and filled with curried cauliflower. Super yummy. I had the pork, and my friend had the meat platter which came with house sausage, duck confit, and a third meat that I can't remember as our visit was a few months ago. I don't like duck particularly but would have ordered that duck in a heartbeat.   Everything was fantastic.  We finished with the lemon Panna Cotta and it was accompanied with goose berries. Delicious.   Everything here is homemade, seasonal, and in most cases, local.   Looking forward to an opportunity to go back soon, and write a review when the meal is fresh in my mind."}
{"text":"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and service at KB. First off the waiter was just amazing. So accommodating and personable. His recommendations were spot on for us and we bantered back and forth like we were old friends.we will come back just for the service alone. I ordered tuna tartare, bone marrow and then finished with the Venison rib eye. My wife ordered braised pork belly. I can say this is in the top ten meals I've ever eaten,with the Venison so perfectly rare it melted in my mouth. We can't recommend this little Gastropub enough. Love it!"}
{"text":"Traveling to Ottawa made a stop in Whitby specifically for KB. Welcoming staff, great atmosphere & phenomenal dishes.  Ordered every recommendation made by the staff including the beverages and cannot point out a negative.  Menu changes regularly as explained but enjoyed their steak tartare, brie fritters and duck entree.   Even Heinz ketchup, a make or break for those who have grown up in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Love love love the food....best ive had except my husbands...love the ideas and  thought put into their menu!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God.  This might just be my new favorite restaurant, all-around. And in Whitby! Who'd have thought.  I had the rabbit, my friend had the porchetta, and we shared the duck liver pate as well as the flourless chocolate torte. Literally everything varied from extremely tasty to \"to die for\" (the rabbit in particular was spectacular, with the best polenta I've ever had and a sauce that had me scraping off the last bits). But their menu rotates every week or so, so who knows what will be there next time - though I would happily trust their chef with whatever he presented to me. Portions were also startlingly generous, especially considering the price, quality, and presentation of the food.   Service was attentive, knowledge, and very friendly. And the local, organic, sustainable aspect is just the absolute cherry on top of it all, as I always love to see organizations with good heart and a community mindset.   Bonus points, if they were not already maxed out, would be given for complete friendliness when silly me left my purse there and had to come back after closing time to retrieve it.  Thanks KB for a truly fantastic meal, and I'm looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Pros: Very central location and great ambience. Wait staff seemed very knowledgeable about the wine.   Cons: food is well done but bland. It seems ideal for the white buffet crowd. I had the flat iron steak, crab cake appetizers and my wife had the beef short rib. Food was well done and well presented just bland. Seems like they missed a great opportunity.   Physically it is very small so even getting in the door Saturday or Friday is a challenge. We had a reservation but there is really no where to wait but the front door.   Overall: if you like well done but bland food hit the keg. If I could speak to the chef I would say you are almost there so why not be more daring with your seasoning and make it memorable."}
{"text":"I love Whitby but I'm not so in love with the restaurants.  This place, this place is an exception!  The Angus burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had and they can make something as simple as mac and cheese stand out above any previous examples you've had.  Give it a try!  I think this is the bets restaurant in Whitby."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Friendly, happy staff enjoy their jobs. Menu changes frequently with seasonal ingredients. Chef's love of food is apparent in his menu! I would recommend this restaurant to anybody!"}
{"text":"My first Farm-to-Table restaurant that was highly recommended by a friend. Sometimes 'highly recommended' means 'if you don't go, I will drag you.'    Well, FINE then.   I headed there after work. Traffic was fabulous, as usual, so I was starving when I arrived and my mom was super impressed how late I was. Needless to say, an appetizer was in order! Burbs Bruschetta was our selection. Little cubes of sweet pear on a crunchy crostini topped with basil and garlic. I could've eaten 10 plates of these. The flavours were perfectly balanced and, not to mention, a great way to wake up those tastebuds!   Our main courses consisted of Willowbrook Farms Porchetta and the Breast of Chicken. The chicken was proscuitto wrapped and pan roasted. My mom said it was seasoned so that it didn't even taste like chicken; she wasn't sure she was given the right dish! It was served on a bed of beans and jus. Her plate was promptly cleaned!   've heard so much about pork belly, that I couldn't resist. If you haven't had it before, it was daunting at first; the word 'belly' was a bit off-putting.  It was so tender, so tasty, so juicy. I expected to enjoy it, but I didn't realize I'd like it THAT much! The pork was slow cooked and rolled with a healthy layer of fat. I'm one of those people that cuts the fat off everything, but I had to try it as it was intended and I'm glad I did. It actually had a pleasant texture. The meal was served with mixed veggies in a tomato based jus.    Desssssserts! Since, I'm a bit of a crème brulee fanatic, I chose the Avocado Crème Brulee. I know you're thinking the same thing as I was, but I HAD to. My mom picked the Homemade Pecan Tart. The tart was topped with merengue and whipped cream. After my mom's first bite, she definitely caught the homemade taste; the pastry was just like Nan's! As for my dessert.....it was the most unique crème brulee experience of my life. I cracked the hard, sugar coating and went right for the custard. This was followed by immediate confusion; I literally tilted my head. Trying to taste the avocado was difficult at first and then there it was. Subtle, it gave the custard a smooth texture. It was delightful(not warmed though!). Luckily, my mom tried it and was also confused, so I knew it wasn't just me. :D  The servers were great. Quick and knowledgeable, they were not afraid to joke with us. I think my favourite moment was when we asked the gentleman for the dessert menu and he said no and walked away, completely straight-faced. Cracked us up!   We had a great experience at Kb and recommend anyone to go there for either a family gathering, drinks or date night. As a bonus, the menu changes all the time! You'll never be bored!   Made it worth getting in traffic for!"}
{"text":"My real rating is 3.5/5 but I'm rounding up because I'm all for local restaurants opening up in Whitby. There is a serious lack of original and local restaurants in our town and everyone should check out KB - it's definitely worth checking out. Considering the menu changes with what's in season I'm judging mainly on service, decor and price point.  I ordered the Burrata cheese appetizer ($10) and the homemade ravioli ($22 I believe) and finished our meal off with peach cobbler ($8).  All of the food was fresh, seasonal, well priced and GREAT portions. Great food that doesn't take itself too seriously. Our server was attentive and entertained my questions about where the food comes from, which I appreciated.  I took off 1 point for the decor/music. There was a mix of 70's, 80's and 90's music playing. It was very distracting, a little too loud you could almost sing along. The ambiance didn't match the food - it made for a confusing dining experience.  I'll be back to KB."}
{"text":"This place was so great! Randomly saw the good reviews on Yelp, and my mother in law lives in Whitby, so i book marked it for future reference.  The service was incredibly attentive. Their Caesars are made w Walters, my favourite! All the food was excellent, everyone was happy with their choice.  I got the burger and it was GIANT. The fries were excellent. We all shared the cheese board w duck pate and the little crackers were great! Overall, no complaints at all. A true Whitby gem!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  An ever changing menu.  Prices make it a special night out versus a regular go to restaurant however for the quality of food the prices are reasonable.  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place has a truly great, creative and frequently changing menu prepared by skilled chefs.   It's a place I absolutely know will exceed my taste expectations no matter what I order.  It's here where I try all my new things because I trust I'll love them.  Pheasant.   Duck tacos.  Boar.   All kinds of interesting ingredients and sauces meld the meal together and form flavour combinations I'd never imagine in my own home cooking.   Trust this place for your meal.  Despite the 5 star meal experience,  this place isn't so formal that you can't arrive in your everyday garb.   The majority of diners are casually dressed suburban warriors happy to have found such a great place to enjoy a gourmet meal in a city full of fish and chips joints and pizza places.   The servers are also very relatable and friendly with great knowledge of and shared appreciation for the menu.  They have great recommendations for wine pairings.    My wife and I tried them all in Whitby and this is #1 for us."}
{"text":"Amazing locally sourced seasonal dishes.  We've been going since \"The Burbs\".  Always good.  Amazing wine and local micros on tap.  Have the KB Burger or crab cakes."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been once with my boyfriend and once with my family, everything was excellent both times. The wait staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and the food is incredible. Will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"I had dinner here recently with my husband, a longtime friend (who now lives in Whitby) and her husband, and let me tell you, it was fantastic.  KB uses local and sustainable ingredients.  Their menu is very creative, and I was told it changes frequently.  The food was phenomenal, the decor was cool and funky, and our server, Jo, was superb.  After we were seated, Jo asked us if we had been there before.  When we told her that my friend and her husband had been there many times before, but my husband and I had not, she started to tell us about the restaurant.  When she discovered that we were from Ottawa, she told us a bit about Whitby and the history of the town.  She was so friendly and a great server.  I had the Wild Mushroom Tacos, which came with a side salad ($16).  They were hands down the best vegetarian tacos I've ever had.  The mushrooms were really meaty.  They were very substantial and their flavour had a lot of depth.  The tacos also had some sort of slaw in it with nuts, some pickled onions and topped with microgreens (sprouts).  The flour tortilla was slightly crunchy on the outside but still somewhat soft on the inside.  It held up well (I really don't like it when tacos get all soggy and fall apart).  The side salad was mixed greens with cucumber and microgreens in a light vinaigrette dressing.  It was simple, but delicious.    My husband had the shrimp and grits ($14) with a side of fries ($4).  He loved his meal.  I got to try some of the grits and they were so smooth and creamy.  The fries were also excellent.  They had some Parmesan cheese on them which gave them a bit of a nippy kick.    My friend had the Arancini Balls and a side of beets, while her husband had the Mixed Grill.  I didn't try any of their food, but they really enjoyed their meal.  If I lived in Whitby, I would go to KB all the time."}
{"text":"The Sawdust IPA tasted like grapefruit.  It was the bomb. My husband and I were thrilled we ordered the 20 oz size. My husband ordered the blue cheese burger and stated it was very good.  Fries were limp and lovely.  My curry chicken burger was the worst.  Two small dried out chicken nuggets on a roll.  The menu stated curried but I failed to taste the curry flavor.  I requested some sauce, ate the nuggets and scrapped the bun.  All and all, for the price would not a return (the curry chicken burger should be taken off the menu).  My husband said he had a good meal and we had a perfect beer."}
{"text":"What a lovely dinner I had at KB. My partner and I ventured out on a Sunday night to find a late dinner. We saw that KB was open and decided to pop in. Thank god we did!  Our server Saviour was just amazing. He told us all about the restaurant, explained a few dishes, and told us about the Sunday night prefix menu. I started with someone wine, that Saviour happily let me sample before I bought it, and we were onto the meal. The prefix is $30 and includes a starter, main, and desert. We also wanted to order an app, but were told that it might be a lot, as the prefix menu was a ton of food. I appreciated that info instead of letting us spend more and not finish it!  To start, I got a salad and my partner got the soup. Totally vegan and totally amazing. If I recall correctly, it was squash with carrots and tomatoes. So perfect the salad was grilled romaine and was also just right. Our main was a roast beef on potatoes with a GIANT Yorkshire pudding. It was way too much for me to even finish! But in a good way. The roast was cooked perfectly to a med rare, just as promised. For desert I got the chocolate tort and my partner got some crazy coconut concoction. Both were just to die for.   We plan on making this a regular Sunday routine!"}
{"text":"*WHITBYLICIOUS REVIEW*  While Torontonians scrambled around to secure reservations during the Summerlicious craze, I decided to take a short drive East to check out Whitbylicious - who can say no to free parking?  This year's Whitbylicious featured prix fixe menus from 9 restaurants.  Downtown Whitby is actually quaint but you can find a handful of amazing restaurants all within walking distance.  My favourite restaurants in the area are all around Dundas Street + Brock Street intersection.  This year, we decided to go to kb (the initials of chef Kevin Brown) formerly at the now defunct Burbs Bistro.  While his new restaurant is void of white linens, the delicious food is here to stay!  The $35 prix-fixe dinner menu consisted of an appetizer, main and dessert.  We started with a bottle of Two Oceans Sauvignon Blanc, quite reasonably priced at under $25 a bottle.  To start we had Local Organic Lettuces, green and yellow beans, toasted almond + rhubarb vin.  Unfortunately, my dining companion was not too fond of this salad.  So....  Take 2: The Grilled Romaine with heirloom beets, egg, house Ricotta + sweet onion vinaigrette.  Always been a fan of this salad and the sweetness of the beets played off well against the saltiness of the cheese.  I opted for the Celeriac Bisque with house Guanciale lardons as I was feeling under the weather and this hit the spot!  For my main I opted for Local Organic Berkshire Suckling Pig with beet syrup glaze, local cucumber salad, potato and yam purée in jus.  This was quite delicious and the bounty of local Ontario produce made it even better!  I always think crispy, roast pork whenever I hear the term suckling pig so this was a bit different than what I imagined.  More like a pulled pork or slow-cooker pork. Nonetheless delicious.  The Artic Char was good, save for the bit of albumin that reared its ugly head on the surface.  I really enjoyed the grain salad of bulgur, local beets, greens + rainbow chard that came with.  It had a lot of different textures and flavours that just melded well together.  Dessert featured a Local Cherry + Passion Fruit Bread Pudding which was very moist, not extremely dense, and the tartness of the fruits made this dessert just right.  The Lindt Dark Chocolate-Espresso Mousse was more chocolate than espresso, interlaced with layers of Chantilly and topped with fresh raspberries.  KB is one of two go-to restaurants for me in the Durham region (the other being PORT in Pickering).  It's hard to find restaurants in the 'burbs who aren't \"playing it safe.\"  KB also offers cooking classes and a Sunday Roast (from 4-9PM) for $25, which is also a 3-course endeavour."}
{"text":"I ate here a year ago and loved it, I couldn't wait to return. Unfortunately my meal didn't live up to my high expectations.  I started with the grilled romaine salad, which consisted of one romaine heart with 3 blistered cherry tomatoes. On this visit there was very little dressing, all I could taste was the char from the grill. The romaine salad I ate here last year was significantly better with more flavour, interest, and a larger portion.  My sister and I shared the grilled chicken tacos and braised beef ravioli for our main. The chicken tacos were a major let down. They were incredibly spicy and the chicken was rock hard, some pieces even burnt. The braised beef ravioli were flavourful and the beef was very tender. However, I found the whole dish to be one note in terms of flavour.  The KB I experienced this time around was very different from last year. Perhaps a change in management or kitchen staff has led to lower quality food. I'd give KB one more chance before I write them off completely."}
{"text":"This is arguably the best meal I've ever had in my life. My partner and I pride ourselves as people who love exploring different and unique restaurants. Furthermore, I'm gluten free vegetarian which makes eating out a little more difficult - the chef at kb addressed my dietary needs with ease. My partner and I ordered a cheese platter (he also got a pâté which was enjoyed by him) and the chef accommodated my gluten allergy with corn chips. So amazing. He sources the cheese locally and it was flavourful. Furthermore he incorporates this cherry compote that was exquisite with the cheeses and the corn chips. The cherry compote was like a flavour explosion of deliciousness. Then we ordered the cauliflower steak which achieved this amazing juicy flavour that was so palatable; similar to that of a juicy meat steak. The vinaigrette was not overbearing and the whole meal was delicious and filling. After being completely wowed by this meal, we of course had to try dessert. The flourless bittersweet chocolate torte was to die for with a scoop of vanilla gelato and the cherry compote. It was the perfect amount of flavour and sweetness with a texture that literally melted in my mouth. Overall, the atmosphere is really lovely. The servers are so knowledgable and welcoming - a reflection of a truly passionate chef restaurant owner. People are coming in, receiving hugs and I get the feeling that with the chefs approach to changing up the menu weekly, they get a lot of regulars. After this amazing dining experience, when I noted the bill I was floored! I mean, food of this quality and a fine dining experience for under $60 for two people!? It is well worth the 45 min drive out of Toronto to visit this restaurant and an absolute necessity for those driving out to eastern Ontario. My sincere compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant on Saturday on a double date. Parking was free which was nice. When we first got there it wasn't very busy but it sure picked up later and I saw people waiting for a table.  Our server's humour took a little bit to understand but he was very friendly and quite the comedian. He was very good at upselling. We wanted a glass of wine, we ended up with a bottle. We wanted to try some cheese, we ended up with a cheese board. The wine list was a little on the pricy side for a bottle I felt. We got the highway 101 wine. We only did this because we were celebrating. Otherwise I would of just gotten a glass. The three cheeses were wonderful. (Blue, goat & smoked cheddar). We had the oysters which were also good. The sauce for them was really nice. We also shared tenderloin skewers. They were juicy, tender & the guacamole was excellent.  My boyfriend and I ordered the steak. I liked the veggies it came with. It was really good! The other couple got the duck & the veal. They said it was good too. We didn't get dessert. We were too full. We had a great time though. Food was excellent. Service was great. We will return."}
{"text":"Terrible place. I guess no-one that went into this place has any working taste buds. I had the pasta and this diarrhea soup, filled when solid starch chunks was served. The smell almost made me Gag... It smelled like a dead body. And why does this place have a $$ rating??  I spent $40 for pasta and a beer. Waiter was accommodating though. That chef needs a new job."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I made the trip from Toronto to Whitby to eat here but it ended up being a real treat. It's a farm-to-table, local produce-type restaurant with none of the pretentiousness you might expect.    Firstly, hats off to the service.  It was really good.  The waiters on both occasions were very pleasant and the water was always promptly refilled.  Now the food.  Given the frequency at which the menu changes, what's there today might not be there tomorrow.  Saying that though, there were a few standouts.  We really loved the mac and cheese appetizer and the pickled vegetables.  For the mains, the first time I went, I had some fantastic pork chop.  The second time, with no pork chops on the menu, I opted for the short ribs.  The short ribs were a bit salty but it was still pretty decent.  My partner ordered the home made ravioli which we both agreed was really good.  All in all, a solid place to have high quality meal."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times .. absolutely love their food and the atmosphere.  No matter what we've tried, it's been delicious! Love KBs! :)"}
{"text":"Honestly my DC and I had reservations here in October on the way back from Montreal but we over ate way too much to eat anything else for the week.  Fast forward 5 months another mistake lead us here. Mistakenly bought Oshawa tickets for marianas trench instead of toronto so with 3 hrs before the concert when we found out dt we sped over this way when I remembered this gem.  Best mistake ever! Great friendly faces and service. Everyone seemed genuine and professional.   For appetizers we had veal meatballs and tripe parmigiano. First the meat balls, tender and jam packed full of flavor! The sauce was definitely tomato base but almost had the texture of butter malsala sauce without the curry base. The tripe was in its own category overall, tripe was soft and not chewy with a great refreshing tomato sauce and baked with cheese and topped with a thick  rusty piece of bread. Great thing was both tomato and meat base but totally different flavors.   Mains we got the asian artic char cooked in a banana leaf, I'm normally really iffy about getting asian food or even fusion but great choice.  Fish was perfectly cooked, flakey and moist. The coconut with ginger really flavored it lightly but well.   The second entree was the fried buttermilk chicken (brined in bourbon) with and spicy slaw. Frites were meh but the sandwich on a potato roll was delicious. I was too involved in my fish to care much about that though lol   Overall amazing farm to table type dishes with a lot of creativity and heart!  One of my favorite dining experiences in 2016!"}
{"text":"Great dinner, had the soup (mushroom fennel) was delish, calamari was excellent, steaks were awesome. Can't wait to go back with friends to try the cheese and pate selections. Would recommend you try it out...."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have been more than happy with the meals, service, and changing menu. If there is a better place in Whitby/Oshawa I have not found it. Don't go if you like packaged meals - this little gem has some great flavour and offers game.  I look forward to what may come!"}
{"text":"Great local beers and wines available; super friendly and helpful service and excellent farm to table food including a daily revolving menu..."}
{"text":"\"I originally wanted to give this a 4 or a 4 and a half, but some of the food items were just okay and that really hurt the overall score. To me it's a 3.5\"  I've been looking for places like this for a long time. A restaurant run by someone who's been an executive chef for a while and wanted to start their own place. A place where the menu changes frequently because the ingredients do. Where all of them are sourced locally from local organic farms with strong and distinct flavours. On the surface and on the website, I was already sold as it checks off all of those boxes. Located on Brock St in Downtown Whitby, it's a nice looking place on a street with a lot of great places.   Atmosphere:   A bistro like atmosphere with two seperate dining rooms and lot of tables but still very cozy feeling. Full bar adoring the back end and nicely lit with again a bistro like feel. Staff is very friendly both front of house and serving staff. Professional and courteous and knowing how to judge the vibe. Coming with a couple of friends they gave us lots of time to chat, catch up while also giving us a lot of service.  Food:  The menu has a lot on it. There are a lot of items you can choose from for Apps, Sides, Snacks, and Mains with a seperate dessert menu and expansive Wine and Cocklist list. The menu is printed on regular 8.5x11 which I can appreciate as it probably changes weekly which is just great to see. We had the charcuterie with the Soft Cheese, Aged Cheddar and Duck pattie. It was smooth, different pieces of crostinis and fruit along with the cheese selection. Pate was smooth but also topped with a caramelised onion. Texture is very soft, but that's why they give you the crispy crackers.   For mains everyone except me had the burger and fries while I had the hanger steak medium rare. While the cook on the steak was fine, it was just doused in a very tangy, overpowering sauce that coated the steak and vegetables making it very tart, salty and tangy in the wrong ways which took away from such a flavourful cut of meat. I was disappointed in that. The burgers were fine, and topped on a nice lookin bun with fresh hand cut fries. For dessert we had the flourless tort and the brownie. Both were nice and chocolatey, smooth and creamy.   But by then I just couldn't get over how such a good steak, was ruined by that overpowering sauce. The food also did take 45 minutes or so to prepare which wasn't as noticeable since we were lost in conversation, but would've preferred for it to come out a bit quicker as we people were slowly leaving the restaurant before we got our mains.  Overall, a nice place that I'd love to give a second chance to because I think the first time was just an aberration."}
{"text":"My quest for discovering new places to eat in Durham brought me to KB. Their online menu looked interesting and their reviews were very good.  We had a 9:30pm reservation for a late dinner and it was still busy when we arrived and waited about 10 minutes for our table. I got the impression that a lot of the diners were regular patrons.  Our menu differed from the online version due to the ever-changing farm to table concept. We were looking forward to trying the Roasted Beef Marrow Bone and the Arancini but they weren't on the current menu. Our server recommended the Bruschetta, made with pear instead of tomatoes. It was a good start to our meal.  For our entrees, we had a roasted pork loin and duck breast. Both dishes were absolutely full of flavour and delicious! The portions were good but I definitely would have eaten more. The presentation was also very attractive. Excellent food!  For dessert, we chose the creme brulee but they were sold out. Darn. My companion ordered a cappuccino. Our server, who was very good throughout the evening, surprised us with two complimentary cappuccinos since some of the menu items that interested us were not available. That was a really nice gesture. That's service!  We'll definitely be back to see what other farm fresh dishes are being served!"}
{"text":"So we have been back since this my original review and the service team and culinary team just nailed it!!   My cocktail still came in a wine glass with ice and was watered down but other than that, it was a fab evening.  We will 100% be back!!   ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was our first time to the restaurant and we went on Valentine's Day. Upon arrival (on the exact time of our 7:30pm reservation) we were told that our table would be a few minutes and to go to the bar to order a cocktail. Yes, this is an old technique by servers to drive up the bill but if I could suggest that they don't do this when there are clearly 5 tables of two set and ready on the floor and no line up at the door.   I ordered a \"Glamour Girl\" cocktail at the bar \"while we wait for our table\" and it was just ok. Served in a wine glass with ice and a straw (one of my pet peeves) it was watered down and maybe better suited for a summer beverage on a patio.   For starters we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese which was very tasty but came as an entree size (I recommend sharing this). The bone marrow which was good but under  seasoned - a little salt on this dish would have elevated it to the next level. The toast points that accompanied it were done perfectly. We also shared the house pickles which consisted of beets, onions, pickle and carrots. The pickling flavours on this plate seemed to be quite basic. I probably wouldn't order this again.   Entrees were sirloin and pasta (apologies, I can't remember the exact name of the dish) and it was quite good. The pasta was cooked to absolute perfection! If the culinary team is reading this may I  suggest pairing these noodles with a braised meat and rich sauce on a future menu as it would be amazing!!  The second entree was the rack of lamb which I ordered a glass of red wine with. Although there wasn't a lot of meat on the rack, the squash ravioli it came with was quite filling. There are a lot of flavours on this plate which I liked but might be too much for others (depending on your taste).  Earlier in the evening while waiting at the bar, we heard a server talk to another guest about the delicious Butterscotch Torte so we knew that is what we wanted for dessert. However, when we tried to order it, we were told they had ran out. Again, it WAS Valentine's Day but it seemed a little early to run out of a dessert offering. So instead of each of us getting a dessert, my partner ordered a cafe late and we shared a creme brûlée. I do not like coffee, mocha or espresso flavours  AT ALL so you can imagine my disappointment when I tried the creme brûlée and it was pure coffee flavour (although there was no indication of this on the menu or description from the server when we ordered it). Sadly, this was how my meal ended.   Overall the meal and experience was \"ok - good\" and I will go back and try it again.  I think there is room for some finessing within a few areas of the restaurant but like I said, I would go back and try a few more dishes and cocktails.  Let me know what YOU think and if I should try something specific next time."}
{"text":"Man. What an amazing place in a small rown. Jackie has given me awesome service and everything on the menu is spectacular. Wine lovers: this is the place. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places I've found to date in Whitby. Charming but not stuffy. They were playing Jimmy Buffet, for God's sake, as background music on the evening I was there. So fun! My impression is they take their food and their craft seriously, but keep the rest of it all light.  Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and helped me find a perfect wine pairing for my meal. My meal was amazing and highlighted the skills of the kitchen: meat cooked perfectly, a sweet cherry reduction that complimented the pork and those veggies! I cleaned my plate. Don't risk not getting in on the day or evening you want to go - make a reservation to make sure you can eat. Love KB. See you next time!"}
{"text":"We just celebrated at KB with our 2 kids (ages 9 and 5) the food was spectacular and the way they treated us and our kids was fantastic. The service was impeccable and we were greeted and thanked for our patronage by Kevin Brown (KB) himself. Local, organic and fresh make all the difference.   My son crushed the chicken breast and my husband loves the lamb (and he's Welsh so he knows lamb!!!) I opted For the Tuna as I felt this was a place that should be able to handle tuna - I was not disappointed. It was spectacular. Probably the best meal I've had in years. They know what they are doing with tuna for sure   We are only sad that we are not local and cannot visit more often. It will be a destination for us the next time we are in the neighbourhood or even passing through.   Do not miss an opportunity to eat here. Don't do it. You'll regret it."}
{"text":"I like this place, and I think I will go back again to try their dinner. We passed by this place on our way back to Toronto last weekend after seeing a small field of lavender. It is located in the Whitby downtown. There are parking on the street or parking lots inside the small streets near the restaurant. We went there for lunch, and the restaurant is clean and bright. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very comfy. The waitress its very helpful and super friendly. The great part is that they have an online reservation on their website."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner at KB's for the first time a couple of months ago after someone recommended it to us.  This is a fabulous restaurant addition to the downtown Whitby area.  The ambiance of the restaurant, the wait staff, the food were all fantastic. We both had the braised lamb shanks.  It was an excellent dish that I thoroughly enjoyed, albeit the dish was a bit 'safe', ie, low on spices.  Nevertheless we both gave it the thumbs up (my friend is a professional chef).    The only downside to our experience was the amount of excessive noise in the restaurant.  KB's didn't implement any noise reduction options into their restaurant design and on a happening Friday night, it was beyond loud.  Hopefully they can do something about this in future.  Having said that, it is a fabulous restaurant that I look forward to visiting again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to my family and friends."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak dinner here. The chef is great, its clear he knows how to cook but the cut of meat they used wasn't great and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"So was it worth the drive from Toronto to Whitby...I'm gonna say no. I understand that the menu changes regularly. This is very good if you're a regular. We were one-timers.   The food was very good but not great as I expected. I ordered the Pork-loin. It was tasty but it didn't blow me outta the water, was a little overcooked. The appie was good. It was a cheese/duck liver pate with flat bread/crostini & condiments selection. Great idea & very nicely presented.   The house made desserts (we bought a selection) were all very tasty. My ONLY disappointment was the overdone Pork Loin. I'd probable go again."}
{"text":"We have been to KB several times for date night. The food/wine is always exceptional and the service is great. Make sure to have reservations otherwise the wait is quite long on the weekends.   We had the lamb shank and the hanger steak. The lamb melted in my mouth and was well seasoned. The hanger steak was cooked to perfection and the sauce was amazing.   Definitely one of rare great places to eat in Durham!"}
{"text":"I have been here once so far. I was offered a cocktail and was not carded(I am underage), it was great for me but not so smart on their part. My friend and I were quite full after our appetizer of arancini and soup. The server had no problem allowing us to share an entree. He was extremely kind and professional. I did see a spider on the wall. Most people are very frightened by them but I put it in my napkin and let it go outside. I sat near a family. I'm not sure if there is a children's menu but the kitchen prepared something suitable for them. It was a great night."}
{"text":"We came back for valentines day again this year and was pleased to see that they were no longer doing the seatings they did two years ago. The restaurant was quite busy on a Saturday evening (with valentines day being on the Tuesday, we thought we'd go early and have an enjoyable evening with no work the next morning!) but we were immediately seated in the back half of the restaurant. We don't often get to sit back here but it was quite nice as there's a TV over the fireplace so we were able to watch one of our favourite foodie shows while we waited for our meal!  I came here in December and was blown away by the pate and once again... TO DIE FOR. I honestly wanted to lick the container clean, its THAT good (I might have stuck my finger in the jar to scrape off all the remnants.... YUM). They put some kind of fruit compote on the top that really cuts through the richness of the pate while still allowing the pate itself to be the star on the flatbreads/bread they bring with it. I shared when I had it the first time and this time, no deal, no sharing, all mine! My hubby had the bone marrow, which he enjoyed but said he wouldn't get again as its not typically his type of appetizer. I tried this too in December and it was deeeelicious - didn't have the optional sherry luge after (they give you a bib, you put the bone up to your mouth and they pour a shot of sherry down the bone into your mouth, sounds cool!).   We both got steak for our mains, I got the hangar steak and he got the flat iron. While the cuts are similar, the steaks themselves and the way they're prepared are quite different. The hangar steak was the clear winner for me, SUPER tender, coated in lovely sauce and done to perfection. He really enjoyed his flat iron but for me, hangar steak all the way. I'm allergic to crab and his came with a crab cake on the side; we let our server know and they graciously subbed in a piece of chorizo instead of the crab cake, much appreciated.  I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get more of the gorgonzola butter that was referenced on the menu, I half expected it to be perched on top of the steak when it arrived. I was REALLY looking forward to that component and I felt like it was missing. Underneath my steak and veggies was a lovely confetti of harvest vegetables that was INCREDIBLE. While everything on the plate held its own, including the confetti, the confetti itself paired beautifully with the steak and really took the whole dish up a notch. Again, wanted to lick my plate clean.  Unfortunately the only shortcoming was dessert. I've had the creme brulee here before and it was disappointing and on this particular day it was orange flavored, which I'm not a fan of, so I ended up going for the donuts. They were disappointing... they looked great but there was something on the plate that just did NOT go. I'm not sure if there was too much cinnamon or something in the sauce but it wasn't the experience I was expecting. My hubby got some kind of italian layered cake thing that he loved, I wasn't as much a fan. I feel like KB does a fantastic job of everything else, drinks, apps, mains, but they really need to step up their dessert game if they want to have us stay for dessert. It's very hit or miss - when I was there in December, they had a lovely sticky toffee pudding, almost cake like in consistency, warm and delicious. But the time before that, nothing stuck out on the dessert menu so we passed.  This remains our very favourite local joint for dinner or special occasions. They know how to treat their customers right, the staff are incredibly knowledgeable and the food is top notch. You won't make a mistake in coming here for your next meal!!"}
{"text":"Everything Kevin makes is bloody delicious. I can't even. When he's not there, the food slips in quality a little bit, I've noticed. But when he is there, everyone is on their game. Love this place to death!"}
{"text":"Returned to KB with a friend for a quick Lunch.     Awesome choices.   I had the KB Grilled Cheese w chorizo and my friend had the Steak sandwich.  Both were ample sized portions - absolutely delicious sandwiches.  The grilled cheese was oozing with melted cheese.  Lightly grilled bread.  Slurpalicious.  My only complaint is that I HATE BEETS and they were diced into my side salad.... but no worries I know for next time.    If you haven't been you MUST go!"}
{"text":"I went to KB's in January - second visit - this time I had the crab cakes. The most delicious crab cakes I've ever had and the accompanying slaw - delectable!  The staff were friendly as always and very knowledgeable about the menu.   Perfect spot for lunch or a bite before heading out to the movies.   Small and cozy, easy to find street parking."}
{"text":"I don't visit Whitby often. Usually I am here because my camera has some issue and I need to bring it in for factory warranty work. For every time I am in the neighbourhood, I always try to go to a \"new\" restaurant I never been with recommendation from my Yelp App. So that's how I ended up at KB.  For lunch you can either order from the Main menu or their limited lunch menu with a sandwich for $12 or an entree for $15.  Fried Chicken with Side Salad($15) - Nappa Cabbage-Apple Slaw/Sweet Chili Glaze/Toasted Almond  Crispy Chicken is definitely my weakness.   The dinner menu is really promising and I guess I need to come back again.  KB also serves coffee from local coffee roaster Treblicock which is my favourite coffee beans supplier.   So next time, I need to have a cocktail and a coffee to end my meal!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the Best restaurant I've ever been to.   Being a somewhat picky eater, I am typically hesitant to try unknown items on a menu, however after my first dining experience at KB's I discovered a new found desire to always try something I would never normally try, but only at KB's. Not only am I pleasantly surprised time and time again, but I find myself anticipating their new menu each week and craving the wonderful feelings I get when I go there and widen my palate horizons!  Kevin (the owner and head chef) is ALWAYS there making a major presence and ensuring each guest is being taken care of. He either knows the majority of the diners, or he's just a friendly outgoing man, either way he definitely understands how to run a restaurant.   Jamie (the manager) is a fantastic individual. Always checking on tables and refilling drinks, genuinely greeting people as they come in, always dressed to impress and consistently making everyone feel welcome. Although a Habs fan, he is one of the (many) best parts of KB's.  A place for anyone who enjoys phenomenal, fresh, mouthwatering local food done right. Such a unique place that I would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants to open out in Durham Region, for their chicken liver pate alone.  Great catering to gluten free clientele, the food is always so fresh and a great selection from boar to rabbit to veal, etc. Even the vegetables, so often a forgotten side, are bursting with flavour. I could eat a plate over their beets alone.  Fantastic wait staff too!"}
{"text":"I decided on KB for my 30th birthday dinner this past Saturday the 7th, since it's local and I had been there once a long time ago, I thought it would be a lovely night.  There was 12 of us in the party, reservations were made quite a bit in advance. When we got there they were setting up a long table with candles in the back room, no problem, my guests and I had drinks at the bar (the main room is open concept).   After being seated it was from that moment until the moment we left three hours later that our evening was absolutely incredible. From management, to waiters, bar staff and the kitchen, everything was perfect. The food is incredible, the attentiveness to my guests and I was spot on! They brought out 12 shots (an extra tequila for the birthday girl!) for all of us on the house, a gesture that was surprising and so sweet!   I can't praise this restaurant enough, honestly. I will be back time and time again, without hesitation.   Go. Go eat here, take your time, enjoy the atmosphere. It's perfect."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people celebrating a birthday. The location is out of my way (about 30-40minutes), but the food, atmosphere and service makes up for it!  I do spend some of my time in the Durham region, and knowing that there is a small and classy restaurant along the way makes it better.  Most of the items on the menu is locally grown and in-season\"game meat\" (Elk, rabbit etc), cheese, breads and an extensive wine menu. The server was friendly and knowledgable about the current menu and which wine pairs with the food we were having.   I had the \"breast of chicken\" with mushrooms. The chicken was super moist and the mushrooms were good too. For dessert I had the Creme Brûlée, this was my first time having Creme Brûlée, and it was great. I could've had seconds!   This is a great place in Whiby, and whenever I'm in the area I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After being told numerous times to check this place out, me and my girlfriend finally decided to go. We made reservations for 8 and were promptly seated. We were given paper menus and told that it was because the menu changes on the daily basis, which I thought was pretty cool. They told us they use organic, sustainable ingredients whenever possible and that most of their stuff is local as well.  We ordered cocktails to start. I got a caesar, which is how I base a restaurants cocktail ability, since a properly made caesar isn't easy, and it was good. On the spicier side because they used Walter mix but very good. The girlfriend got a Kbana, which was a rum drink with fruit juices and other stuff. Not for me but she enjoyed it.   Then appetizers. We ordered buns, which I thought was a little strange they didn't simply come to the table, but they were amazing. Hot and fresh, with herb butter. So good. We also ordered the grilled octopus, which came on top of fingerling potatoes and was great as well.  On to mains. For myself, I got the venison sirloin, on top fingerling potatoes, with a beet salad, sautéed greens and jus. It sounded a little fancy for my taste, I like simple food, but it was actually really good. The deer was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the potatoes were crispy. The slightly bitter greens offset the sweet beets and the balance of the entire meal was perfect.  The girlfriend ordered hanger steak, which was tender and well marinated. I didn't have any of her sides but they came more or less the same as mine, since the deer was on special as a protein and was probably just integrated into the ingredients they already had.  Finally, dessert. We were given a dessert menu, and asked if we wanted coffee, which we did. The dessert menu contained multiple options, as well as a list of gelato and sorbet. We settled on the \"share plate\" of 3 items. Flourless chocolate torte, creme brûlée, and mango sorbet. We waited a few minutes, and our coffee arrived, and it was really good. More of a diner style coffee, which I love. Then the desserts came out and we were NOT disappointed. The chocolate torte was so decadent, the girlfriend could only handle a few bites, but I devoured it. We moved onto the creme brûlée which was rich and creamy, with a perfect crispy top and a sugar art presentation. We both agreed this was our favourite of the trio. Then we finished off with the mango sorbet. It was creamier than most sorbets, which made it all that much better, and the mango flavour really came through.  All in all the experience left us full, satisfied, and with a slightly expensive cheque, but we both agreed again, it was totally and completely worth it. You truly get what you pay for, and we got a fantastic evening full of delicious food."}
{"text":"Ok here's the scoop.. wanted to check this place out with a few chef' friends of mine given the raving reviews. Now, I have a rule of thumb, when rating on Yelp, please consider your full experience . This place truly isn't a 4.5 on Yelp and should between 3-3.5 at the maximum. The food we had, see attached pictures ..steak, chicken and veggie option one of each to be fair. The Keg does a far superior steak?? And they cut the steak for you and bring you a steak knife? Really? The mushroom needed to be washed not in water but vinegar to take out the earthy tones from it. The chicken wasn't too bad. Anyhow, I also realized the folks who are rating this place are from Whitby and they are not fine dining too much so to them ya I can see why this place has such great ratings. The service staff here can't even get you a drink on time and are too busy doing their thing but will greet you nicely till they seat you."}
{"text":"Just moved from DT toronto to Ajax and wanted to try out all the nice restaurants with my gf.  Found this place on Yelp and was drawn by its good reviews.    We ordered the Sunday 3 course special.  Foods are just as i expected, nice and not too expensive.  The big big big downside is the serving was just too slow.  We waited about 25 mins for the main course and another 20-25 mins for the desert.    But the people were very nice.  I give 4 star for the nice people and 3.5 for the food.  If u only care about the food, i would recommend.  But of u r not too patient with long wait, then avoid it."}
{"text":"I have been a few times, on a variety of occasions, and have always been impressed. They even did a great job on our small private (approx 30 people). Food quality is really great and the atmosphere is nice."}
