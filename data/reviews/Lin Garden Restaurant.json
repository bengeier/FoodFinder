{"text":"I got to say, I tasted my share of Hakka food, and obviously nothing can compare to homecooked Hakka food coming from my bestfriends house, but this tops all the Hakka restaurants I've tried, EVEN FREDERICS!   Thanks to the reviews here, I tried the shrimp fried rice and the house shrimp. While my company ordered the chili chicken. Everything tasted YUMMY!   Though the only downside was the noticable taste of MSG in the shrimp fried rice.  Overall, this is my new Hakka place! Service wasn't as bad as frederiks and it's very affordable. Try this place out. You won't be dissapointed =)"}
{"text":"This is authentic Hakka Chinese that we grew up with at Kolkata Chinatown. The best are the hakka noodles, chilli chicken, shrimp pakora."}
{"text":"I had so many second thoughts before I came inside this place. It is nestled in a small strip mall, you would easily miss the place if you are not looking for it.  I have been there about 4 times, twice for lunch, twice for dinner.  It is a favourite for business people during lunch, because it was packed in there. It didn't take very long to get seats. The servers and waitresses were very efficient.  There's also lunch specials that you can order as well.  The food always came piping hot. I am vegetarian and there are a lot of great selection. If you don't eat egg, you could always ask them to remove it from the fried rice.  Most importantly, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I go here every now and then.  We don't go as frequently as we used to because, like anything, you can get tired of the same old thing.  The menu items haven't changed.  Although they have duck on the menu, which was pretty good, you can't seem to order it.  Not sure why the items remain on the menu.  Green beans with garlic are extremely oily from being fried. I wouldn't recommend unless you like oil.  I had read that the pakora here were really good.  Tried them and would order them more often than not.  Chicken pakora are mushy inside and probably under-cooked. Shrimp and beef not bad, veggie I would pass on.  I was there two days ago and chose not to order the pakora since they have changed their prices yet again.   I'm pretty sure you used to get 12 pieces for $10.   Recently the price was changed to 10 pieces for $10.00.  Hand written in the menu as of two days ago (not sure when this change happened), the pakora are now way over priced at 5 pieces for $10.00. RIP OFF. A couple strikes against this in-need-of a desperate makeover restaurant will have me going elsewhere from now on.  Too bad for them.  We are usually a group of 6 and I will definitely spread the word to friends who are regulars.  Their pricing hits me in my pocketbook... we are going to take the opportunity to have them feel the same.   Good luck.  Try No. 1 Hakka on Kennedy Rd., south of Eglinton Ave. in Scarborough.  Glad I pulled over and tried this place yesterday.  Great food, more variety and a way cleaner looking dining room compared to Lin Garden."}
{"text":"Lin Garden was the first Hakka restaurant I ever tried and I still go back frequently. Yes, it's a hit and miss, sometimes the food is great but sometimes it lacks quality. The service is pretty bad but I never had a horrible experience with any extremely rude waiters. My brother actually confronted the guy that always sits behind the counter about rumours that the meat wasn't halal but he was very nice about it and assured him it was truly halal. He claimed that Lin Gardens competition spread that rumour.   Overall,  I still love Lin Garden! Their Munchurian chicken is the best in Toronto IMO. Also the price is great and they have a large sitting area.  Recommendation: Munchurian Chicken Shezuhuan Chicken Munchurian Fired Rice Hakka Fried Noodle"}
{"text":"Excellent hakka food, have had Indian Chinese food at quite a few places between GTA, Virginia and NewYork, but this has to be the best place I've tried. Chilli Chiken is legendary, if you are there you will find this served at every single table. Their chicken pakora, American Chop Suoy, and hot and sour soup are amazing.   Even though i live in mississauga, but i visit them often as their food is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their chilli chicken and Manchurian chicken . This has to be my favourite hakka place in town . been going to lin garden for about over 10 years now and the food is just amazing. i have tried chilli chicken at  many places but these guys are the best at their craft. might be going there next week again."}
{"text":"Hakka food is a spicy fusion of Chinese and Indian cuisine.  It's characterized by heavy sauces, lots of fried meat and full of green and red chillies.  It's a seriously calorie-laden, but irresistibly good style of cooking.  Nestled in an unassuming strip-mall (again?), this is very likely the best Hakka food in Toronto. The portions are inhuman, so order less dishes than people. I never leave Lin Garden paying more than $10 for a truly gigantic portion of food.  There are lots of tables, fast turnover, quick but gruff service, and they can seat 12 people without much fuss.  It's not going to win any design awards, but the food makes up for the lack of ambiance.  Dishes to try include Chili Chicken, Chicken/Shrimp Pakora, Crispy Beef, Garlic String Beans, Manchurian Fried Rice, Chicken Corn Soup and Hakka Chow Mein."}
{"text":"Do you like DISGUSTING FOOD? Rude service? THIS IS THE PLACE!!  Came here because my friends keep hyping it, I don't understand why. It's gross. No amount of MSG would help. I wouldn't eat here if it was free. Although if it were free, they would have a line up of crazy people that enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Lin Garden is a Hakka style restaurant. It's one of my favourites. This is a place I go when I want something delicious and cheap. Excellent food, fair prices and rapid service. My favourite dish is the crispy beef. It's a great place to go with 4-6 people as you can order several dishes and everyone will be satisfied.  I once went with a group of 14-15. We all are and were satisfied and the bill was $125.  I highly recommend this place. I have never been disappointed or had a bad experience."}
{"text":"It is one of my favourite Chinese food restaurant nearby my house. I love their chilly chicken and Manchurian fried rice. Since i am their regular guest they always treat me perfectly and super fast, but i noticed sometimes they are lack of costumer service.  The only thing i don't like about this resto is the restaurants setting. It doesn't look good for me, or even acceptable for a famous restaurant like Lin Garden. I just come for their food, but for place to talk it's not recommended at all!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several time before. Food tastes average to me. My experiences have been average. Pepper sauce is average."}
{"text":"Its an alright place. Sometimes their food is good and other times it sucks. I have eaten from here over 15 times and I have finally realized that they can make good food but they do not have good customer service skills."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing about 5 years ago...now it's sucks. I will never eat here/take out from here again. Called to order pick up and could not understand what they were saying because the music in the background was so loud. When I asked them to repeat the order they finally got it right, but when I got home and opened the bag it was totally wrong. Also the food quality has really gone down!  The proportions compared to other popular Hakka restaurants is totally weak!  Please do not eat here. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went there again to see if anything changed,and to my surprise it went ''Worst''. The cooks are Chinese from mainland China,not Hakka Chinese(from India). The fried rice;cooked it at home - taste the same. Chili Chicken; leaves a bitter aftertaste in your mouth;also can be cooked @ home. 2008 was my first time at Lin Garden; Chili Chicken was juicy and tender,had a authentic ''hakka flavor'' -no bitterness-not just chunks of dried chicken breast . Somewhere between 2010-2012 the ''hakka'' cook must have left Lin Garden. My advice, to you is: If you are very hungry and don't want to cook at home;save time and money and you don't care about the taste of the food- Go eat @ Lin Garden."}
{"text":"I'm not happy with my visit to Lin gardens. The food was not fresh at all and the noodles were really dry. Broccoli also tasted like grass. Customer service wasn't great as well, the lady kept ignoring us when we would ask for water. Overall, I will not be coming here again.  Toodles."}
{"text":"My family has been going to this restaurant for years. Despite the terrible customer service and total lack of ambience, what kept us going was the decently priced food and taste. After several encounters over the past year with rude servers and management, we won't be coming again!  When dining in the restaurant on a busy Friday, our food arrived undercooked (pakoras deep fried until quite dark, but raw from the inside) and when we sent it back, they simply threw it back in the fryer and brought the exact same batch out. When we inquired about this they were unsympathetic and literally told us \"if you don't like it then don't eat it\". We left without having a meal and took our business elsewhere.  A restaurant that does not care about the customer experience and only about delivering low quality food \"on time\" is not a place worth going to. Try the millions of well priced and quality food/service Hakka places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Lin Garden...USED to be our favorite restaurant.  Our frequency was about once very two weeks; then, we walked in one day and to our surprise - they had increased significantly the prices of their dishes and...DOUBLED the price of Pakoras.  Pakoras, for us has been a starter and important part of eating Hakka food.  Now, we have found another establishment which prices their dishes according to what their offering is rather than, just because they have more foot traffic.  Customer service, is inconsistent and shows with the previous comments.  Lin Garden has gone in the wrong different with regards to earning more PROFITS (maybe they are looking to sell their business in near future and, need to inflate their profits in the short-term get a better price) and, we have DECIDED to take our business, elsewhere.  C'est la vie!"}
{"text":"Good food and good selection of spicy and non-spicy dishes. The service is horrid, rude staff!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chili Chicken. Not the greatest place to eat in, not the cleanest place but they get the green pass. I have enough faith in the government that they deserve to pass. Good food, cheap prices. Two out of three ain't bad."}
{"text":"RUDE SERVICE! DIRTY! they don't stand behind their advertised deals! I will never go back and offer my business to them. If you want to be disrespected and eat in an unsanitary place then lin garden is for you. Everyone else,  avoid lin garden like the plague!"}
{"text":"Ok to be fair I've been here 3 times and I always found their servings are large portions and Manchurian noodles (orange color) to be good but things that I can't stand hence the low rating: 1. Service - damn right poor enough for people not to come back here  2. Smell - there is a bad odor coming from some of the food which doesn't really help increase one's appetite 3. Taste - I ordered the hot and sour soup once and it was I'm sorry to say terrible (I thought it was expired)  Net, I wouldn't recommend this place to others although it's one of the few Chinese Hakka places that serve Halal food in the area"}
{"text":"Delicious dishes at great prices! Chicken pakora, Hakka noodles (chicken Hakka chowmein) are my faves. Chili chicken is good too."}
{"text":"Picked up some take out tonight - it was the busiest I've seen the place in ages!  Almost all the tables on both sides were full, plus there was a lineup out the front door for people waiting for take out.  Ordered the usual; Chili Chicken, Hakka Chow Mein, Crispy Beef Kam-Bien, House Shrimp, Kan Shue Green Beans, Chicken Fried Rice (don't usually order this but we had some friends over).  Everything was hot and fresh.  It's hard to keep the green beans and house shrimp crispy in take out containers, but really, the best they can do is cut a hole in the cover so the steam doesn't make everything soggy.  Sometimes I feel like there's a bit too much MSG, but tonight I didn't down 2L of water after eating, so it must have been the perfect amount.  And steamed rice isn't included anymore when dining in.  I think it's $1 for a small bowl and $2 or more for the large family size.  I'm actually surprised they didn't start charging sooner for this, but it's a small price to pay for great food!  It's best to call ahead when ordering take out or else you might be waiting a long time.  They also offer a 10% discount if you pay by cash or debit on orders over $20."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food in the local area! Great price for the amount of food you get! Check it out if you are in the Scarborough area looking for yummy Chinese cuisine! It does get busy but they make an effort to serve you quickly.  Call ahead and place your order if you want to avoid waiting in line to order take out."}
{"text":"Generous food portions for dinner for 2.  Served with egg rolls, 4 main dishes and dessert for $30.  Left the restaurant with a full stomach."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for the lunch special whenever we get the chance for years. It has stayed pretty consistent and the price is AMAZING compared to the huge portions, I had enough for dinner as well. I had the Shrimp Chow Mein today with chicken corn soup (amazingly warm and delicious) as was the main dish. Both had just the right amount of everything in my humble opinion.  The rest of my family ordered Beef with Chili Sauce and Beef Chow Mein and one person ordered the hot and sour soup instead. Everyone loved it but two people did find it lacking in spice and basically finished the entire jar of chili that they usually have on the table with the soy sauce.  The service was really fast, we were barely half way through the soup when the main dishes arrived. They were warm but not as piping hot as some would've liked (i don't like my food too hot so it wasn't a problem). Atmosphere and location was good, I did find it kind of odd that they had popular English music playing but again, no biggie. The only con is that after eating, I was parched, no matter how many glasses of water I had. This is something I haven't experienced before but I guess i'm more susceptible to the salt level now that i've started eating healthier...or they've started adding more MSG, i don't know. Hopefully this dry throat will disappear soon. But just a word of warning, be prepared to intake more liquid than normal and don't visit this place more than once a month."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! my fave hakka place! always enjoy eating here, whether its dine-in or takeout. its family run - service is hospitable, restaurant is not the nicest, but its worth it for the food they serve.  food is cheap, large portions served family style. shrimp pakoras and manchurian rice is AMAZING! plus their chili chicken and chicken corn soup are pretty kick ass too.  always satisfied with this place...4 stars instead of 3 just cos so far its the best hakka place i've been too.   must try: manchurian rice, chicken corn soup, shrimp pakoras, chili chicken (around $10 per person - portions are large, perfect for 4 ppl - for two ppl would recommend either shrimp pakoras or chili chicken - unless u love walking away with lots of leftovers)"}
{"text":"I came to this place for the food and to learn more about Hakka cuisine.  And here are what I've learned:    - Hakka cuisine in Toronto is basically a traditional Chinese cuisine doped up with Indian spices.  - There are different variations of Hakka cuisine.  Hakka people moved around a lot and adapted to local cooking styles wherever they went.  - I think I'm in love! [with Hakka cuisine, that is]  The dish that blew me off my seat was the Chicken Pakora.  Those big balls of \"fire\" were so good and strong flavored that I could see smoke coming out of my WingMan's mouth.  They were super crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I loved that they used dark meat, heavy spices and fresh green chili.  It was the bomb!  Their famous Chili Chicken was okay.  It wasn't as hot and spicy I imagined it would be.  The biggest disappointment was the Crispy Beef.  It wasn't crispy at all and was lacked any distinctive flavor.  For the price and A-OK food, it is great for families and the budget conscious.  Would I return?  Yes.  Solely for the Chicken Pakora!"}
{"text":"I'm not stingy with my stars I swear!  So why two you ask? Well my good friend... because I feel like a restaurant should excel in all parts esp if its catering to as many people as Lin Garden does... and simply doesn't.  I feel sorry for you if you are going/went for  sit down meal there, honestly one of the worst things you can do! I have done it a few times and I have definitely learned the hard way.   But their food is pretty good I really LOVE the Chilli Chicken along with every person out there."}
{"text":"Great food - Affordable prices - Low quality service (don't let it stop you!)   Chicken is always fresh but don't forget to mention \"spicy\" if you want to feel a kick. Plenty of Noodle choices and they are all delicious....Rice plate is huge. Hot and Sour shrimp soup is a must. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great price. Great value. Go to place in that area. You would love it if you like spicy food.  But tons selection for non spicy food as well."}
{"text":"Food is great, portions are huge and price is right.  Chili chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"OMG !!! I have not seen such portions in awhile. We ordered the fish pakoras and they were huge and amazing. Everything else we got chow mein, machurian beef, chilli chicken were veru tasty. Enjoyed our dinner here.  And tomorrow is left overs :-) Great prices too !"}
{"text":"Good food, especially given the price. They have lunch specials around $5 with plenty of variety. There's not a lot more to say; it's fairly simple and cheap."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant ever with regards to customer service and food. I've been a long time customer until recently i noticed that the food started to taste strange the past few times that we went here. The food has a chemical taste and the chicken doesn't taste like chicken, it has a weird taste. We ordered food from here and the restaurant told us to bring it back for them to check, when we did the owner took the food to the back and said it's fine. I told him to taste the food in front of me, he refused to taste it in front of us and said food is fine. It's not about the money i didn't want a refund but the fact that he made us drive all the way back and wouldn't taste the food or apologize is what was upsetting.  We immediately stopped going here  because the chicken started tasting different and also tasted like there was chlorine like taste in the food. I have not gone there ever since and never will."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Hakka joints other than Frederick's. The portions are huge. Don't confuse the chicken with chili sauce lunch special with the normal chili chicken. They aren't the same. When I come here with coworkers for lunch we usually order full size dishes to share it comes to about the same price and you get to have more variety. With three people ordering the Chili Chicken, Chicken pakora and Manchurian fried rice there is still enough to take home for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great food would definitely be back! The spicy beans and the chilli shrimp were delicious."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things about Lin Garden and upon my first visit I could immediately tell why. I was not aware of Hakka food until I tried this place and I can basically sum up the food here with 3 bullets.  -tasty -huge servings -oily  While the food is good, I can't get past amount of oil in every dish. Each plate was literally glistening and while it was a delight at first, eventually the oil gets to you and you cant even finish your meal. Maybe its just me."}
{"text":"The food is below average but tolerable.  It's the greedy and dishonest business practice that will never have me coming back.  Our group lunched there recently and due to some distractions, we mistakenly overpaid by $15 (on top of the tip) for a $63 lunch. When we came back to ask for a correction, the owner did admit that we overpaid but just flatly refused to refund our money.  His excuse was the overpayment had gone into some irreversible account??!?  We didn't have time to argue with him, and we're never coming back.  If they can cheat you to your face, imagine what's going on in the kitchen! Don't waste your money there!"}
{"text":"Been going to Lin Garden for over 10 years. Great food and amazing prices. Personal favorites are the crispy beef, chili chicken and Manchurian rice."}
{"text":"This grease soaked mess is where the concept of dirty feed comes from. My friend Vanessa introduced me to the term a few years ago. And I quote \"dirty feed's the colon cleans-Ar of a few shit fuck days.\" Her words not mine, but poignant while I struggled to down dinner.   A few of us suffered together, ordering some good; shrimp pakora (crunchy curry filled shrimp ball), house shrimp (house seasoned and lightly fried) an inventive hakka version of chow mein with shrimp and chicken, and their garlic pan-fried green beans. Some bad; anything with their Manchurian gravy-like concoction (garlic chicken, Manchurian fried rice, spring rolls etc.) and the stomach ache that followed me for several days.   Beyond the lasting negative impression of the food, I was left feeling a little under serviced, when as we waited for one of our party to go to the washroom, we were unceremoniously kicked out of our table. While we were not eating, there were several people who still had drinks and obviously we were waiting for our friend. Honestly what has happened to the state of customer service in Toronto.   Bottom line...if you really need a colon cleansing I'm sure you can find one where they treat you with a little more care."}
{"text":"Great food and gret prices!    THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR RESTAURANT, SO WHY ARE PEOPLE JUDGING THE PLACE LIKE IT SHOULD BE ONE????  It's a cheap affordable restaurant, that dishes out fresh great tasting Hakka food.  If you want to eat in a 5 star restaurant, GO TO ONE!  These types of places should only be judged on service, seating size and taste. All of which Lin's have!  Yeah, the decor is somewhat tacky (yet they did recently reno) and the seats aren't leather and you don't have private booths, etc., BUT they serve some great tasting hakka food, with fantastic prices.  Recommend the chicken pakora - best in Canada!  Also, on weekend evenings for dinner, YOU BETTER CALL BEFORE PICKNG UP. IT IS BUSY!"}
{"text":"I like it spicy so my favourites are Manchurian Mixed Fried Rice (chicken and shrimp), house shrimp and chili chili fish. Their fried banana ice cream is great too if you're dining in."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years whenever I feel like having something spicy with flavour. I usually call ahead and order take out for pick up and the guy on the phone always seems like he's in a hurry to hang up. I had dined in once with a couple of friends over 5 years ago to celebrate my birthday. The food portions were more than we could finish, with the bill around $40 for three people including taxes and tip. I just found the dining area busy and a little crammed, but it was an ok experience and the service was also surprisingly acceptable at the time.   As mentioned by others you need to spend $20 and up for credit card use and I think that the $20 and up rule also applies to 10% cash discount on take out orders. The prices have increased over the years, but they still have reasonably priced dishes that you can share. They also used to offer free white rice with some orders before but now they charge for it, which I think is now $1 more. I usually stick to certain of my favourite and regular dishes like the Manchurian chicken and beef with chilli sauce, so I haven't noticed any change in taste and quality. I never had any bad experience with the food.  Today I had ordered crispy deep fried shrimp for take out and they were still preparing it when I arrived. As I was waiting for the order I looked around at the empty main entrance tables and chairs which must be the overflow area whenever the inside dining room is full. The décor does look outdated but the place always seems busy. They only thing that looked out of place was that they used pieces of cardboard under a couple of the table legs to keep them level. but other than that the place appeared clean and maintained. The shrimp I had ordered was also crispy, fresh and hot."}
{"text":"If i was writing this review 10 years ago I would I give them 10 STARS, Lin Garden was our cheap comfort food place , hang out, and what not, but now, first of all we are all older and matured ( at least we think we are :)  ), this place does not appeal to me as much or at all anymore, and on top of everything the food quality has gone down drastically.  My wife just brought some takeout from Lin garden yesterday, because she went there with her friend from Ottawa who was in town, and she is in love with this place, as they don't have anything like Lin Garden in Ottawa, that being said if you are new to the Hakka scene, you should definitely try  Lin Garden, they still do better Hakka than most Hakka places in the GTA, but it is not like how it used be.  Our usual order  Chicken corn soup, ( ask to be be steaming hot) Chili Chicken ( a must try ) Manchurian Fried Rice House garlic Shrimp( used to be out of this world good )  House fried rice ( i think it is chicken and shrimp)  Sweet and sour chicken Manchurian chow mein   Cheap beer :)   They are also LLBO, and get really busy on some nights, especially on the weekends  so if you are in the Borough, it would be worth it to stop by  Thanks for reading   PS. if yous are one of those, who treats their \"body like a temple\" then stay away, it is unhealthy on so many different levels,  just like any other Hakka food but once in a while it is yummy good :)"}
{"text":"Upon my most recent visit to Lin Garden I was most disappointed. This legendary venue used to be one of my most prized and go to Hakka spots, but on my last visit the food seemed off.   My hot and sour soup could have been much hotter, both with heat and temperature. I was not pleased with it like I have been in the past. The chili chicken was extremely dark and so salty, what does this mean? Either they ha ave changed the recipe, or the chef accidentally dropped in the soya sauce dispenser while making that batch.   For fun my mate and I ordered sweet and sour chicken balls, we both agreed it had been years since either of us had had them and it was very well priced. They were spot on. The sweet and sour sauce was thick, syrupy and very tasty. The chicken balls had the perfect crunchy/cripsy texture, while the meat inside is as good as it gets for chicken balls. Truth be told if it weren't for the chicken balls this review may have been 2 stars. The fact that chicken balls practically bailed out Lin Garden is very sad.   Please take it back to where you used to be Lin, until then I'll be fulfilling my hakka urges at Frederick's | http://is.gd/4NTgv |and Szechuan Gourmet."}
{"text":"Lunch portions are huge and very affordable. There isn't anything healthy here to eat FYI.   The house shrimp is bombbbbb."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Good for pick up. I wish they had delivery options. The crowd is all Indo Chinese."}
{"text":"Food was great. Chili chicken, green beans, broccoli/mushrooms, chicken corn soup and Manchurian chicken fried rice. Service could have been better. Place was really busy on a Saturday night with only 2 waiters.   Great price too.   Recommend."}
{"text":"By far the best Hakka food I've had in the GTA. Cheap, fast, delicious, GO!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND... - House Shrimp - Chicken Pakora"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, and ordered the Manchurian Beef and Lobster Sauce Shrimp. Food was unflavourful and bland, especially the beef - just tasted hot with very little flavour. However, it seems to be a very popular joint and the restaurant was almost full. I didn't like the food - but perhaps we should have tried the Chili Chicken that everyone raves about. Two dishes, a medium bowl of rice, and a ginger ale came out to 30$ including tax. Likely would not go again."}
{"text":"Hakka cuisine is what my parents would call \"cho\" food where everything is a bit heavy-handed (oil, spices, ingredients) and incredibly filling.  There's nothing subtle about Hakka food - Lin Garden merely satisfies this criteria.  One of my lunchmates told me that his South Asian colleagues swear by the chili chicken.  Really not that bad!  The chicken pakora was heavy laden by cumin, the fried rice was a neon orange, and the plain-ish noodle and tofu dishes were nice plain compliments to my already flaming, spiced-hot lips.  We left completely stuffed, with stomachs glowing a florescent orange, I'm sure."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming for over 10 years now. They are halal but serve alcohol which ia awesome if you have a mixed group. The house shrimp is life, I'm a vegetarian and it's my only weakness!!!  It is a hole in the wall, but a gem."}
{"text":"This is solid grub for hungry people.  It is inexpensive and does the job.  Plus, a ton of leftovers.  Just don't try to impress anyone by taking them here!  I came because I needed to finally find out in life what Hakka food is.  Now, I know...I think.  The service is efficient and the food came fast, suspiciously fast! lol  What we ordered (chili beef, house shrimp, sweet and sour breaded chicken pieces) had generous portions.  It was tasty, but was over-sauced or over-fried to disguise any day-oldness or reheatedness, which is about right, when I think of all the meals I ate, when I lived in China.  Leftovers were ok for about a day, and then I couldn't take it anymore!"}
{"text":"The Lin Garden UYE reviews by my fellow Yelpers Danielle, Sarah, Chris and Christine have hit the nail on the head here.    The overwhelming bland MSG gravy packaged (with bright food colouring) was too much.  We sampled each dish and left most fully intact.  The best overall summary of this place is the pic of Sarah L attached...her face really captures the true Yelp review of Lin Garden.  Go to Szechuan Gourmet instead (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/szechuan-gourmet-restaurant-north-york)."}
{"text":"They have great food and you get a lot for what you pay but their customer service isn't too great. I've called to place an order to pick up and they haven't picked up the phone or hung up on me several times."}
{"text":"Lin Garden has been one of our staple food places since we were in high school. So as someone who's been going there at least once a month for the last 9-10 years I have nothing but praise for the place.   We've tried many, many, many Hakka places but there's a reason we always come back to Lin Garden. The portions are ridiculously big and prices are very cheap. The service is normally outstanding. I have to say normally because there's been a few times that are exceptions to that rule.   We normally order a dish per person and everyone grabs something from each plate. The must orders according to our group are the Chili Chicken, House Shrimp, Manchurian Noodles, Manchurian Chicken and Special Chicken. As someone who doesn't handle spices well I have to throw my vote behind the Sweet and Sour Chicken which is one of the better ones I've had in Toronto.   This is a no frills kind of place. It doesn't look great indoors or outdoors but the food is great and service is usually very fast. This is the kind of place you come to satisfy cravings not to impress a date."}
{"text":"This place is honestly a Scarborough staple. It has some of the most diverse set of east asian food. The quantity is amazing for the price, nothing is over 10$! I ordered around 4 and got all my dishes at about 415, talk about fast service! Every dish is made very flavourful! Most dishes are very spicy however, so if you don't like spice make sure you specify when you order."}
{"text":"Good cheap Hakka food. The prices are on the lower end compared to other Hakka restaurants but the food is often fairly comparable.  The service tends to be decent as well. I'd recommended try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Authentically inauthentic.  I usually am not a big fan of fake Chinese food.  In fact when a friend of mine worked as a cook at a well known fast food chain, I refused to eat of the food even though it was free.  But for whatever reason having been inspired by an old episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservation where he travelled through Manhattan Chinatown to discover real Chinese food, he talked about the fake stuff he grew up on.  As he pointed out, there's nothing wrong with the food, it's just not Chinese.  As a kid he would look over at the Chinese people and realize the food he was eating was not the same, and in fact there were two differing menus.  One in a book, and the other on flashy paper stuck to the wall.  On this day I felt like having one of those authentically inauthentic meals, and Lin Garden was that place.  It looks like it was pulled from the late 70s and early 80s and managed to maintain the exact same menu too.  I knew this was going to be an experience as I was the only Asian person aside from the staff during a busy hectic lunch service.  The place was packed, and the line for take out went out the door.  I couldn't get myself to order the \"deep fried battered meat\" doused and drenched with some sweet sticky red sauce.  Broccoli isn't even a native Chinese vegetable!!  How this became the western symbol for Chinese food, I'll never figure out.  Funnily enough, China now has a few of these Western-Chinese food that serves fake Chinese food complete with fortune cookies.  Saw one in Beijing and it was fairly empty during a dinner service.  Instead I ordered something close-ish to what my mom would have made at home, a black-bean beef with veg on a bed of rice.  It was.. okay.  I just sat back and imagined what life would have been like during the 70s non asian, and thinking wow.. so this is Chinese food.  Dyn-o-mite... Out-of-sight!  http://app.toronto.ca/food2/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=9018449"}
{"text":"5 stars, ALL THE WAY!!  Best chilli chicken by far!! So much flavour and SO much food!!  It's like $8 for chilli chicken on rice and you get a massive portion! I have had knock offs of this and nothing has come even remotely close!!  Yes, its not like the 5 star setting, but my rating is strictly on the food. Taste is AMAZING. It's a blend of Indian and Chinese so there is TONS of flavour.  Oh, and its super fast service. If you call in they can have your food ready in about 15-20 min.  YUMMY FAST AND CHEAP. MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Hakka food and....LOVED IT!!  The chili chicken was good, the house shrimp was yummy but my favorite is probably the manchurian fried rice...  Gosh...writing this review is actually making me sad that we don't have any hakka places here in cali... =("}
{"text":"I will start off this review by saying that I came here with an open mind, as previously I only had Hakka food once at another restaurant and it was a wonderful experience. However I am not really a fan of this place.  The restaurant has two adjacent rooms. We entered the one on the right hand side and were directed to the left one, which is for dining in. The place was not very busy on a Friday night but seemed to have some local patrons. Decor was actually a bit dated and table was greasy.   I sat down with my husband and the server brought up the menu. We decided to order chicken with pineapple on the menu; however when I told the server of this, she suggested that we order \"sweet and sour chicken with pineapple\" cause it was \"more popular\"? It did not quite make sense to us but we took her advice anyway. Husband ordered hot and sour soup, which had chicken in it. The order came fairly quick. Chicken was alright but a bit chewy. And my husband said there was a weird taste to the soup and did not finish it.   When we walked up to the counter to pay, a guy was dozing off in a chair with his arms crossed beside the lady cashier. I guess some people might find it \"homey\". Unfortunately I don't. I understand that everyone gets tired but is it really necessary to let customers watch you sleep in your restaurant?  To conclude I am disappointed with my experience here, especially after reading so many good reviews on Yelp.   Still exploring for good Hakka food around GTA."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars  Came here with a large group of friends, this was my first Hakka experience so I really was not sure what to expect. We came in and were seated rather quickly, this is a small place in a Scarborough strip-mall. Being a large group we decided to order a few dishes and share everything (which is probably the best thing to do at this place since the portions are so large).   The best dish of the night was definitely the pekoras (we ordered the veggie and chicken) these were moist, crispy and seasoned with cumin which gave them a nice smoky flavor, this was probably the least spicy dish of the night. The house shrimp was also very good, lightly breaded fried shrimp that had a nice spicy kick to it  Honourable mention goes to the Manchurian rice which was a neon red fried rice made with red chillies, it was quite spicy. The special chicken which was another neon red dish it was pretty good. The chili chicken and Manchurian noodles were just ok nothing special.   The service here was surprisingly friendly as most cheap Chinese restaurants in Scarborough tend to have atrocious service. The server was very patient with our large group, we had a vegetarian who could not eat eggs and he gladly had our rice and noodles made with no eggs and was more than willing to make sure the chicken and veggie pekoras came on separate plates, A+ for service! In the end we all ate until we were stuffed and the bill worked out to about 10 dollars each including tip, SO CHEAP. If you are looking for a cheap and spicy meal this may be the place for you, I for one will be back."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time last night with my SO for take out. She is half Hakka and she told me that the Hakka food served in Toronto (Chinese-Indo fusion) is not what authentic Hakka food is, Hakka food is real fresh food, i.e. taking a chicken from your garden in China and killing it and cooking it right away, meaning having fresh food.  Here is my review based off the food and their pricing. Can't say much about service since we had take out. I'm definitely not an expert on Toronto Hakka food since the only place I frequent is Chuong Moi at Eglinton/Kennedy.  We ordered the Chili Chicken , Manchurian Beef Fried Rice and the Hot and Sour Soup which took about 10 minutes and was really cheap for $21 tax included. The place is definitely a hole in the wall  but it was pretty busy for dining in and people waiting for take out.  Chili Chicken: Just average, needed a little bit more heat and a bit too much fat, Chuong Moi does better chili chicken but more expensive at the same time, I think $9.95.  Hot and Sour Soup: Just average, had better at a lot of restaurants and definitely had worse, most restaurants whether Chinese or Hakka can't seem to get this soup right. Lin's needed more heat.  Manchurian Beef Fried Rice: This was really really disappointing, I can't believe that everybody orders this dish, it has no flavour whatsoever.  It is what it is, it's a place for cheap greasy Chinese-Indo fusion food in Scarborough. Prices are cheap and portions are generous. As a previous poster mentioned it does not cater to Chinese people, which makes sense since 70% of the people dining there were of Indian descent."}
{"text":"This place is a neighborhood institution. They've always been a hit-and-miss kinda place from when I started coming almost a decade ago. When the food is good, it's really good- and the same can be said for the service. It's a 50-50, though and I think that it's usually worth the risk."}
{"text":"Lin Garden is fitting of this Scarborough neighbourhood and this plaza.  It is a bit off the main street of Sheppard, therefore a normal passerby will not typically find their way to Lin Garden.  People will know of it by word-of-mouth or find out about it while visiting Le Cafe Michi next door.    I had some preconceptions of Indian Hakka because of my less-than-stellar experience at Federicks but sometimes reputations are based on some truth.  A thing I didn't like was that we sat right at the Table next ot the \"Dirty\" Dishes Table that they use to accumulate instead of taking it inside back to the Kitchen.  I wonder how many of the sauces and juices  flew my way?  The decor is very Old-style Canadian Chinese but at least the space was lit up nicely so you don't feel the darkness has something to hide.  I mean when a restaurant Deep Fries Meat in the form of a Croquette quite a bit your mind starts wondering......  CHICKEN PAKORA($8.50) - This is ONLY thing I have liked so far in an Indian Hakka place.  Much much better than the unappetizing clump at Federicks.  These Croquettes of perfectly juicy Dark Meat Chicken were nicely spiced and addictive.  I would love this as a Street Food, snacking everywhere I go.   2.5'd  Chili Chicken ($8.00) - Less gluely than my prior Hakka experience and it wasn't quite Spicy, more of a Mild Soya.  Again this is more Food Court item in my mind, so if thinking of that fact along with  price-point then it's less of a complete disappointment.  Crispy Beef($8.50) - Food Court style Chinese food has a similar idea of Cantonese Sweet & Sour Pork.  It was almost like eating thin strings of Beef Jerky with a Dark Sauce coating over it.  Interesting to see and try.  Additiona Info:  One of the server seemed quite lost holding the dish around to see which table it belonged to or who accepts it.  She was a spectacle that every table had someone looking at her to see if it was one of their dishes.  The Steam Rice side order we had seemed a bit blah passed its prime."}
{"text":"This place is GOOOOD! I've tried the following dishes: Chicken Pakora, Hakka Chow Mein, Chilli Chicken, Crispy Beef, House Shrimp, Sweet and Sour Fish, Chicken with Vegetables and Kan Shue Green Beans. All of these dishes are delicious, particularly the Chicken Pakora, Chilli chicken, Crispy Beef, House Shrimp, Green Beans.. um yeah, it's all good! The portions are huge and the prices are amazing. The place is busy, both eat-in and take out. If you like your food spicy, you will be satisfied. I'm already craving my next meal!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here... the last visit was extremely unpleasant.   So we got fish pakora, fried green beans, and house shrimp. serious the fish pakora made me so sick after I got home.  i had good experiences and bad experiences here.. and honestly I just wish the owner can just throw out things and not serve then as they go bad.   gross!"}
{"text":"Was craving Hakka food so we decided to come here on the recommendation from my friend. Apparently, they been in business for 20 years so they definitely doing something right. It's located in a bit dingy and rundown plaza so it's hard to spot the place. The restaurant is surprisingly pretty clean for the most part. I didn't realize they had but the restaurant is divided into 2 sections. It wasn't busy when we arrived. Seems to be a local staple has more people arrived after we finished our dinner. We ordered a few dishes to share. We ordered the chicken fried rice, chili chicken and chicken pakora. We asked for medium spice for all the dishes. My favorite dish was the chili chicken dish and it was quite delicious. Overall, all the dishes were delicious and the flavours were there. Food surprisingly came out very quickly and the staff here are pretty nice. Our meal came out to $30 for 3 dishes which wasn't too bad. Prices on the menu are pretty reasonable. Overall, pretty decent place to get some authentic hakka food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the best chilli chicken ever .. also getting hot and sour soup .. good place if you are into spicy hakka food"}
{"text":"Always a tasty meal and love the portions...my absolute favorite is Manchurian Beef On mushroom fried rice definitely a good flavor and spice"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap meal this is worth checking out. I went with a group of 4 and ordered veggie fried rice, veggie hakka noodles, paneer, stir fried green beans, and chili chicken. The noodles and the chicken were definitely my fave! The portions were also pretty large and we had tons of food to take home.  Decor was nothing too fancy. It's just a good place to grab a cheap meal and hang out with friends and family.   Servers were great. Super attentive and came by our table frequently. Also, since it's a small restaurant that's not too crowded, the food comes pretty quick!  Check it out if you're in town, it's definite;y worth the eat."}
{"text":"One of the older Hakka Chinese restaurants in the GTA, Lin Garden hasn't changed much, after all, why would it if its its serving kick a$$ hakka food, good portions, reasonably priced, and service is efficient! It has always preserved its reputation as one of the best hakka restarurants in the GTA, there are only a handful of these restaurants as many are starting to realize the fad!   Our group of 5 ordered their notables:  Chili Chicken; perfect portion, not overly salty, great blend of flavors, just got to watch out for those green chilis lol! Vegetarian Pakora; perfect size, a little bit on the oily side however still flavorful! Chicken Hakka Chow Mein; portion was huge, noodles cooked al-dente! and lots of ingredients used to create this dish!  Crispy Beef: Probably the best Crispy beef I've had, not overcooked!  Manchurian Chicken: was alright, nothing to rave about,   overall experice was a 3.5-4/5"}
{"text":"Chili chicken is delicious. Fast service, fairly priced, very friendly owners, I will be returning"}
{"text":"By far the most overrated place in this part of the city.  They were one of the first Haka places and are still big for people that find on place and never move on.  The food is good which is the only reason I give the two stars.  Standard Haka stuff chili chicken...  The worst thing about this place is that if you call ahead for pickup, they won't start it until you get their ad pay which saves you no time.  It'd also do rude like you are a prank caller or something.  But it fits with their total lack of customer service, I'm getting really tired of all the Asian places getting a pass on rude staff, its kind of racist.  Parking lot is small busy with additional parking in the poorly lit back."}
{"text":"Lin Garden is the type of restaurant you see frequently on road trips through the armpit of United States, you know, the ones you think will be hilariously bland and gross and the food unfortunately meets your expectations.  The restaurant is surprisingly busy as it caters to the area with its provision of Halal food. Should you make the mistake of venturing into this restaurant, be aware that the kitchen is strangely sweet on red food colouring and grease. Maybe it's good for hangovers, but I digress. Lin Garden poses as Hakka-inspired but it strongly lacks the Indo-Chinese flavouring of spices and heat. Their Manchurian dishes are sadly deep fried protein in red food colouring with corn starch.   In any case, I strongly advise walking down the same strip for some Japanese at Le Cafe Michi http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-cafe-michi-toronto or Shawarma http://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-shawarma-toronto http://www.yelp.com/biz/family-shawarma-and-falafel-toronto#query:falafel."}
{"text":"The green beans were good.   The Heineken was really cheap.  Yup, that about covers it.    The UYE that met up at Lin Garden left in utter disappointment.  Quick rundown of what we ordered.  Hot & Sour Soup; Spring Rolls (that were really egg rolls); Vegetable Pakoras; Spicy Shrimp; Ginger Chicken; Chili Chicken; Green Beans in Garlic; Crispy Beef; Hakka Chow Mein; Manchurian Fried Rice.  (see pics attached)  I had a baseline to compare this Hakka as Devan R. had been our Hakka host over at the Szechuan Gourmet where he annointed us with ginger chicken and crispy beef.  Lin Garden didn't even come close to that measuring stick.  LG was a complete and utter meh, all the way.  The only thing LG has going for it is cheap, cheap, cheap.  That massive pile of food we ordered, plus 7 Heinekens came out to $127 (tax in).    I'm not going to say much else because it isn't worth the effort.  Oh, I did mention the green beans were good right?    My Hakka hunt continues.  Frederick's up next."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place that you must try. Only reason it's a three star instead of four is because I question the cleanliness. But when it came to food and service it was really good. They also serve halal meat so that's a plus!  Prices are cheap relative to Toronto. Food was good. Fresh and flavorful.   I'd definitely go back there but probably for take out.   You gotta try and fried squid!"}
{"text":"***THEY ONLY ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS FOR ORDERS OVER $20!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***  Holy mother of God.... please come here and save me from this ulcer in my stomach.   Went here for lunch. Called in to order to 5 people - the first guy was SO RUDE! YOU SUCK! LEARN SOME MANNERS!!!! asshole. Anyway, beyond rude; the second guy (after the first one hung up) was ok. The food was ready in 20ish minutes, we got it fast.  I ordered there chicken pakoras, manchurian mixed chow mein and chili chicken. Anyone who has been here will know that this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. THAT is enough food to feed a starved army of soldiers with Alf like appetite. But the best part is - i only paid $26 with tax for everything. The portions aren't just big. I can't emphasize this enough.   - Chili chicken was OK - actually pretty flavourless, just spicy but not salty not sweet not sour. It needs something else, like a touch of lemon juice or something. - Chicken pakoras (there were like 12 massive balls....) were delicious. Spicy enough and soft. - Manchurian chow mein was pretty good too; it looks like someone bled all over it, but it's actually the least spicy thing I ate today. It had chilis, chicken, shrimp, egg, etc etc - yum!   I didn't even make a dent in this stuff...me. I probably ate like half the chili chicken and 5-6 chicken pakoras... I feel like a pussy. BUT I AM NOT! I gave it a good try, eating this stuff for at least an hour....The roof of my mouth is pretty much scorched, my tongue is packing up his stuff and getting ready to get out of the hot hell hole that is my mouth.....   I would go here again if i really craved spicy food or something? But i would definitely get one portion. And try the shrimp pakoras."}
{"text":"The Shrimp and Chicken pakoras are quite good but apart from that, I wasn't impressed with anything else. The place positions itself as Indian Style Chinese I.e Hakka but the masala portion is definitely missing. I have had better fried rice, noodles and manchurian at other places (Hakka 77, Fredricks). The pricing is very competitive -I think it's the cheapest out there. The portions are large and the service is fast. It's not a bad option but not my kind of food"}
{"text":"Ordered their hakkah nudle crispy beef chicken pakora and chicken dish .Awsome Chinese food cooked by chines people who use to live in Kolkata ."}
{"text":"Our server Michelle was really friendly, helpful, and prompt.  The food came fast and furious and she was on the ball.  Overall I thought the food was pretty good.  A few of the dishes were hit and miss so here's the breakdown by dish:  Wonton Soup: I wasn't really impressed that it was shrimp wantons and that there wasn't any sort of warning on the menu that they weren't the usual mystery meat.  House Shrimp: Freshly fried, hot and juicy.  Overall really well done.  Shrimp Pakoras: Also really well done, but not as good as the house shrimp.  Chili Chicken: This one was kind of odd.  It was almost like a soy sauce gravy on top of this dish.  Very odd, definitely not my favorite.  Ginger Chicken: Meh.  Hakka Chowmein: Awesome!  A must try.  Manchurian Rice: An interesting bright shade of red.  Not much too it.  Just an average rice dish.  ____ Beef: I can't remember which beef dish we got but I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was lightly fried and tossed in a tangy sauce.  Green Beans: Also really good, a must try.  As far as the portion size for your dollar you are getting a 5 star deal.  There were 6 of us and it ended up being $15 each plus drinks.  There was lots of food to take home also.  I'm sure there are better places to get Hakka in the city, but as a first experience this one was pretty good."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the service and food at Lin Garden. I've been there twice and both times were a total bust. Service was poor and the food was mediocre at best. It didn't help that a member of my party of four got violently ill shortly after. I'm not suggesting it was them but why tempt fate? There are better Hakka places around."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant but unfortunately the food wasn't even edible.  We ordered Garlic Shrimp which tasted like it was a sauce made out of Ketchup.  Then ordered the Szechuan Beef which was terrible.  We actually didn't eat dinner but paid and left.  Never going back!!"}
{"text":"Often get take out here, prices are good. Typically getting chili chicken and manchurian fried rice. 10% discount when you get take out, over $20 paid in cash. Huge portions, I would call ahead as it takes them awhile to get the order ready. Vege pakoras are really good, but can be very spicy depending on your luck..."}
{"text":"Well, it used to be one of our favourites for weekdays lunch and it used to be packed during the lunch time. Their lunch deal used to be 5.99$ which was a decent price for the portion and quality that you could have there.  However the last two times that we went there, they had increased the price and the quality of the food was really bad. I am a big fan of Chinese foods and usually order General Tao Chicken cause it is safe to order and no matter where you go, you expect to receive the same type of food and taste. But the last two times that I went there, they obviously had used soma trash cheap chicken meets to cook the Tao chicken, It was smelly and very greasy. I tried to eat it with hot sauce to not feel the smell and taste, but finally gave up and went to subway. I didn't go there anymore....  Sorry for their greed. Last time that I went there, it wasn't that busy anymore...."}
{"text":"I started going to Lin Garden almost every Friday night for take-out since they opened back in the late 90s.  The food was always very fresh and tasty, great service and good value for your money - I remember a former colleague used to drive from Mississauga every weekend for take-out.  Unfortunately, when I moved out to the west end, I went less frequently and the food became very hit and miss.  The crispy beef, mixed Manchurian noodles, house squid and chili shrimp were always favourites in our house and, now and then, when we're in the area, my husband may pick up a crispy beef.  I, however, am a little turned off because in the past three or so years, we've been maybe half a dozen times and there's been hair in the food three of those times.  Some of my friends still really like it a lot, while others have moved on to Spicy Dragon.  I still Yeuh Tung (across from City Hall) serves the best Hakka food in the city."}
{"text":"Pathetic service. Waited for 30 min with family. They bring the soup and then served food to everyone who came after us except us. On complain they bring one dish but no rice. Again after waiting several minutes they bring the rice but took it from my hand and gave it to the table next to us. Eventually I had to leave and had to buy food from some other place. on my complain the owner had no comments not even sorry pr anything he quickly took his money and gave me the change back as if he was worried about other customers. I am not sure that the chicken they use is actually real chicken, could be rat meat who knows what they use to save money."}
{"text":"This is truly one of my all time favourite Hakka Restaurants.  I am afraid to order something different because I love what we get each time.  The prices are so good and the portions are massive.  I love the owner she is so personable and when you go often enough she remembers you.  Must haves are Chili Chicken, house noodles, crispy beef, green beans however I dream of the house shrimp.  They come dry with a slight breading and they are so garlic that when I put one in my mouth I have gone to heaven......I must go there again soon."}
{"text":"My worst Hakka Chinese restaurant experience ever. I ordered chilli chicken, chicken noodles and shrimp fried rice. At the same night after eating that food i had to go to the hospital suffering from food poison. Their food is full of oil, MSG and soya sauce and it's so called Hakka Chinese. Y people don't understand that their food price is ridiculously low and there is no way on earth  they are serving good quality food. I wish health safety inspector pays a visit to this restaurant and shut this place down."}
{"text":"I would consider this place between a \"hole in the wall\" and an actual decent restaurant.  I normally get takeout or my workplace nearby will have events catered from here.  The chili chicken is the best I've had compared to several other Hakka/Chinese-Indian restaurants in Scarborough.  The general tao's chicken is also good, but not as spicy as the chili chicken. I've also had the house shrimp dish and the green beans which were also very flavourful, although the beans were somewhat greasy.  When you walk in, there is an area where people stand around and wait for their takeout orders, but there are also a couple of tables for customers and a table for staff to work on refilling empty containers of hot sauce. Around the corner to the left is more seating, and that's where majority of the customers are served.  The prices are decent and if you go with a couple of friends, you'd probably spend about $10-$12 each for 3-4 dishes (without drinks)."}
{"text":"Avoid going here towards the end of the day...I ordered some crispy beef and manchurian shrimp rice 15 mins before they were closing and ended up with an upset stomach. This place used to be better but now I'm not feeling it that much."}
{"text":"Ah Lin Garden, my go to Hakka Chinese food joint.  Hands down best tasting chili chicken I have had.  This little family owned restaurant located on Pharmacy Avenue just east of Victoria Park.  It's not just the chili chicken that draws me here but a wide variety of Hakka dishes that are offered.  Manchurian mixed fried rice, kan shue green beans, and Szechuan beef are my recommended starters.  Plus many other traditional dishes.  Thus place is good for lunch or dinner it can be busy at times but wait times aren't long.  Staff is always friendly and willing to serve you.  Take out order pay by cash so you can save 10%.  Minimum of $20 order to get the cash discount applied.  So good got them on speed dial!"}
{"text":"I love Hakka food (Chili Chicken is easily in my top 5).  Lin Garden is probably the closest Hakka restaurant to me.  It's a decent place, not Frederick good, but decent.   Pros: Good portions for price 10% off on take out if paying by cash  Cons: Nothing spectacular Decor could really use an update  I try to be fair when rating Hakka places because I love Frederick and it sets the bar really high.  Lin Garden has been around for ages and is one of the older Hakka establishments in Toronto.  They have a loyal following as they are the only Hakka restaurant in the area.  Every time I go, the place is busy with people eating in and taking out.  So Chili Chicken is probably the dish mostly everyone judges at a Hakka restaurant. I get this every time I go out for Hakka. Lin Garden's version is pretty good.  You get a very good portion for the price you pay. It's nowhere near the spiciness I want it though. For the most part, Lin Garden's dishes are good.  They'er nothing spectacular, but they won't really be horrible either.   Presentation is not a strong point here.  I think this place presents itself like a no frills place to just come, eat, and leave.  I think though, if you are a sit down place that you bring family to, presentation goes a long way.  Some of the decor looks like it hasn't been updated in years.    All in all though, Lin Garden is a solid Hakka restaurant.  When I crave Hakka and don;t want to drive all the way to Markham, Lin Garden is usually where I end up going.  Remember to pay by cash when ordering take out and you will get a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Update- I came here on a Friday night, it was a super long wait for takeout but the food was absolutely delicious!   I've mentioned before, Lin Garden has been a bit of a hit or miss for me lately, but I'm happy to report, they've stepped up their game lately, and the food has been great.   I've only dined in a couple of times, and it's  pretty old and run down, I honestly much rather prefer takeout from this location.   The main reason, we choose Lin Garden, is because half of my family is vegetarian, and their veggie options are honestly pretty amazing.   I some of my usual go-to dishes are:   Veggie  Pakoras : These are super spicy, and are cabbage based, it's unlike any other Veggie Pakoras you'll find anywhere else.   Chicken Pakoras: The chicken is covered in a spicy mix of green chillies and masala before being packed into a ball and fried. They're really tasty, but a tad more expensive than other places, You actually don't get too many peices in one order.    Veggie Hakka Noodles - The noodles are always thick and cooked so well. Never soggy or limp. One of the best ones.   Chili Chicken with Gravy  - a staple! it has a lot of green chillies   Chili Paneer:  THE BEST! Unlike other Hakka Restaurants, Lin Garden is the only place where they fry the paneer in batter just like they do with the chicken. It comes out fluffier than any other Chili Paneer dish I've ever had. It's honestly a great alternative if you're a vegetarian.  Veggie Fried Rice - it's honestly just as good as the Chicken Fried Rice, (they just substitute the chicken with Broccoli ) so if you have vegetarian with you, definitely get this to share!  Chicken Corn Soup - A Hakka Staple! It's a pretty mild soup with exactly as its described; chicken and corn.  - Only frustrating thing is,  are the only Hakka Restaurant who charges for plain white rice"}
{"text":"My first experience was when my dad decided to order food from them for a family reunion.Well my family were visiting from China.Myself yes I am half Chinese and like many South Americans a mix of many other cultures from my mom's side.Going forward I Wish my dad had warned out it was So spicy !!!! My tongue did not stop burning for hours from the red rice.I think they called it Manchurian .And the type of meat balls they had were the same .Our family from China declared their is no way this is Chinese! They knew of Hakka Chinese history but not cuisine.It's not to my taste .Clientele is majority Indian . I guess because they are use to and love spicy cuisine.Mind you I have known many westerners that can eat and lovingly lap up spicy and Hot ,who were friends .But not me ! My dad though is frugal and I think price counts more then anything. else for him so for my nephew's graduation we were forced to go to their restaurant. It's in an old strip mall .The interior is like the outside much to be desired.The table has the plastic covering for table cloths .Which well for me for fast food no bother ....but what I did not like is first the service is  not their ! I asked for a booster chair for my toddler to be told they don't have booster and the woman pointed to the wall and told me to go get it myself ! Lol but when I saw how unclean the old high chairs were ,their was no way I was letting my son sit in any ! Well from my dad did advise them to not make it as hot and spicy for us which they did oblige no problem .So if you don't like it hot and spicy ...just let them know . But still stay away from the Manchurian rice if you don't want  to feel like a dragon is in your mouth :)"}
{"text":"Not the best but definitely the most inexpensive Chinese - Indian food in town. They also offer discount if you offer Cash :) -  I have tried some of their food, not all of them are tasting good. My regular take out menu is; Manchurian Chicken or Shrimp noodle, House Shrimp, Chilli Beef, Chicken corn soup and banana desert. There is an added benefit to this menu, \"it improves your bowel movement\" :) WARNING! The staff is very rude, horrible service and always problem with placing an order. Do not take guest to dine in since I made that mistake and I was very ashamed to my guests. But great to take out (make sure that you check your order before leaving) the owner speaks English, Chinese (Probably Cantonese and Mandarin), Punjabi, Urdu and German :) Funny eh?  I do speak to hear all the time German and she performs very well."}
{"text":"Terrible experience, the chicken tasted like dried fish. The waitress constantly spills water on to our plates, which are poorly cleaned. Waiter has brushed me off for no reason. Washrooms are poorly kept, children shower in there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've gone this long without writing a review. This is LONG OVERDUE.  I went to high school down the street and I associate so many memories with this place from the past 4 years. This restaurant has been the place to go for comfort food and comfort from friends but also a cheap eats place when no one wants to travel too far or spend too much. The surroundings and the decor are sub-par but the mirrors in there will never cease to trip me out!  I know everyone raves about the chili chicken but I truly do not enjoy the dish and prefer the sweet-and-sour over it by a long shot. The last time I was here (which was last week, I kid you not) , it seemed like the portions got bigger. I always order some sort of Manchurian dish because I feel the Lin Garden experience isn't complete with a dish full of fluorescent red on the table. They have quite a few vegetarian dishes so herbivores and carnivores can rest knowing there is something for everyone.  I'm a total fan of spicy food but not the large amounts of MSG, salt or oil I'm sure all the dishes contain and in vast quantities no doubt. I'll be back for sure, but I'm probably going to have to starve myself all day for a meal here!"}
{"text":"Michael who answers the phone is the most rude person I have ever dealt with. He kept hanging up on me and I had to call 4 times just to find out if they are open on a particular day. I wanted to know what their hours were and despite calling back twice (after 2 hang ups) we never got to the hours because of Michael's rudeness. I've been a long time customer but I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Ok when it comes to hakka, there are essentially two choices:  Federick's or Lin.  There is the tangerine too but it doesn't compare.  And when it comes to hakka, ppl usually compare by chicken pakora's.   Federick's has the better pakora's, but Lin Garden is my top choice.  Portions are huge, food is dirt cheap. Less oily than Federick's, but it shouldn't really matter when you're doing the dirty and eating Hakka.  Why i like Lin better is because:  a) it was my first indochinese experience b) i like their deep fried shrimp better than any other place c) their hakka chow mein is better d) the lady who owns the store is my entertainment. She speaks chinese, swahili, hindi, urdu, some german. and she's a joker.  Now the reality check - this is not gourmet. This is plain and simple you getting dirty. The service is shit. Some dishes are flourescent in colour. It's often packed.   But accept it for what it is, and then you can see the good. Don't eat there, get takeout.   When you're depressed, don't eat a tub of icecream like some ppl do - load up on oily meats and noodles. The portions are so big that you will be sitting in front of the tele, wallowing in your self pity in a 5 hour eat, break, eat ordeal.  and then you'll remember your encounter with the funny multilingual chinese women and you will go to bed with a smile. the end."}
{"text":"Lin Garden is right around the corner from my office. A staple of our company pot lucks and a quick casual Friday lunch, Lin Garden delivers each time.  My co-workers and I would go each and every Friday when we wanted BIG PORTIONS and SMALL COST! The lunch combo with choice of soup, pop, or egg roll comes in at about $7. The portion is huge and options include chilli chicken & chilli beef.  About 6 adult males would go, order two chicken, two beef, and two noodles. The lunch special is served with rice that is shared by the table and everyone leaves happy and full.  Great value with quality fast service."}
{"text":"Move over Federicks, you have competition! Lin Garden is here to stay. Those that are frequent patrons of Federicks might find certain dishes (ie. Pakoras) to be far from what they are accustomed to eating, but the flavours are worthy of praise."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again.  Read on if you must.  The good: - cheap (but shitty) beer - green beans were good - but not as good as Chung King Garden or even Moxie's (yes, Moxie's bar and grill, frequently found in the parking lot of a mall, that Moxie's) has a better szechuan green bean dish - House shrimp was proclaimed delightful by all parties - I did not indulge  The inoffensive but not good: - The spring roll was actually an egg roll and it was not too gross to eat half of - Hot and sour soup was acceptable - but not even in the top 50 hot and sour soups I have ever had... there was a lot of tofu but it could have been hotter in spice and temperature... one of my favorite parts of the meal and I really didn't like it very much, so you can imagine what I thought of the rest of this failure dinner (I actually tasted failure... and it tasted like gravy)  The bad (where to even start...): - Everything was breaded and deep fried but nothing was crispy - Every sauce has the underlying flavour of cheap packet gravy... it was WEIRD - The following dishes were so gross I didn't eat more than one piece: ginger chicken (the most gravy flavoured of them all), chili chicken (not a single chili in it, and doused in fluorescent orange sauce that only tasted like gravy in the after taste), crispy beef (not crispy, sauce has no distinct flavour and pieces looked like turds - note - I am used to this being a dry dish, to have it covered in a sauce of a molasses viscosity that hinted at the flavour of gravy was... disgusting)  All in all, I would give this 2 stars, mostly because the beer was so cheap, but as we were getting ready to leave (Christine was finishing her drink and Shari was using the restroom) the owner asked us to vacate our seats because other people were waiting. Sure, I'll just take my half a beer out into the parking lot.  WTF?  -1.  Seriously, we would have been gone within the next 2 minutes, shut your face and go deep fry some more failure.  Interesting to note: nothing else in this plaza is open.  It is completely vacant, save this terrible restaurant."}
{"text":"You like Hakka? You have two options: Lin Garden or Federicks. Both are great with slightly different offerings. I think Federicks edges Lin Garden, but you can't go wrong coming here.  House shrimp is good, chili chicken is good (but could be spicier). I love the pakoras with the green chilis, Manchurian eggplant, and crispy beef. A couple orders of Manchurian Fried Rice or Chow Mein are a must. It's cheap and the portions are big...come with a group and try different stuff."}
{"text":"Lin Garden is supposed to be famous for their hakka food, specifically the chili chicken. I therefore decided to give this place a try. I ordered the chili chicken (dry style), steamed rice, and some egg rolls. First impressions of the chicken dish was it looked pretty standard as far as other versions I've tried. Perhaps lacking on the onion and green chili pepper. Taste-wise, it was very bland with almost so spice or even salt. I did order it without MSG however that shouldn't make a dish totally devoid of savoury flavour. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the dish at all and won't be ordering it from here again. The egg rolls were average and although possibly made in-house they were nothing out.of the ordinary."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.  My husband used to dine here twice a week.  Unfortunately we don't work in the area any longer, so we are down to about once a month.  We've often taken new friends and family to impress them with the different flavours and food selections.  Maria and Michael are two of my most favourite people.  We've been going here for over 17 years and keep coming back.  Our sons will often check the fridge the next day to see if we brought home any left over Hot & Sour soup or Manchurian chicken for breakfast.  Food favourites: Manchurian Chicken noodle, Manchurian Chicken, Chili chicken, House Shrimp, Green beans, Chicken pakora, Veg rice, Beef w/black bean sauce and of course Hot & Sour soup.  Staff: Amazing, from the moment we walk in we are greeted warmly and seated right away.  Water and plates are delivered, and our order is taken (we don't look at the menu).  Our water glasses are filled and our empty plates are taken away quickly.  Overall:  The decor is a bit dated, but the food and staff make up for it.  We'll keep coming for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my fav places to go for hakka food since they're down the street from where I work.  However, as the previous reviewer said, their quality has gone way down and their prices way up.  Not to mention if you order ahead, you still have to order when you get there because no one really wrote down your order.  Only reason I would even think of going back is their House Shrimp, it's really good but considering I haven't had it in a while, I wouldn't be surprised if the quality has dropped and price increased as well."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Not worth it. For a 'cheap' place, it's massively overpriced. Ridiculous queuing order. Not very warm food; if you do get served at all.  I've haven't been here for a while. We came in for nostalgia's sake. Boy, has it changed.   The prices appear to be the same. The pakaroas, however, are not the same. WTF???  The chicken pakaroas were deep brown and not very warm. A clear indicator that the oil was not fresh. Not a big deal. And been sitting around while we were waiting. They tasted okay; not great. The serving size went went 10 pakaroas per order to 6 per order. SIX.   Let's see here: What was $1 per pakaroa is now $1.67 per pakaroa. Simple math, that's a 67% increase in price per pakaroa. I know food prices have been increasing, but not by this much.   Even forgetting about the terrible value of the pakaroas, the rest of our dining experience wasn't so great either. In these places, you're not paying much for service. It's a cheap place.   But, at least serve the dishes you ordered at the same time. And have a queue for which tables ordered first.   It wasn't very busy when we were there. Yet, other tables that arrived or ordered after our table were receiving their food. We had one dish (the overpriced pakaroas) arrive and then sat there for 30 mins before deciding that it wasn't worth waiting for our remaining dishes.   Another two tables got angry and left because it didn't make sense. Why serve other tables first when you ordered before them? Ha, we joked that we were lucky because at least we received one dish.   No apologies for the wait, but I can't say I expect it from this place. I do expect food to be warm and served in a reasonable order.  Not worth it. I love a good, cheap greasy spoon but this is not it."}
{"text":"To be fair, this is probably the first and only hakka indian chinese food restaurant i ever frequent. One of the reasons why I always come here is because the food here is so damn good. The service here is absolutely horrid (slow, rude, careless) and sometimes the food can be too salty, but because of how flavourful the food is, i am drawn to it every time i come back to Toronto.  Our staples here include Manchurian Fried Rice, Chili Chicken, and House fried shrimp. Sometimes we'll throw in the beans for some vegetables. My friend always ends with a pistachio kulfi (indian ice cream) when it's available. Price is average, but the portion is gigantic. $10 a person will get you extra full and leftovers to take home for the next day. Definitely worth it as long as you're not expecting any service at all..haha"}
{"text":"I have to remember one thing whenever I go eat at a Hakka Indian restaurant is that they are not really catered to Chinese that used to eat Chinese Chinese food. I can see the horror on the face if I take some of my Western friends to a Hong Kong Style Cafe which does a Chinese twist to Western food.. that's how I feel when I eat at all the Hakka places in Toronto.   Price wise it is great! Especially with the Lunch Specials at $5.75 that includes a pop. I will be so stuffed eating one of their lunch dishes, weighted down with all these oils and spices.   Chicken Pakora does redeemed my faith in venturing to another Hakka place in the near future as those deep fried chicken balls are so damn tasty and spicy!! Using real whole fresh chili give this dish the needed heat!! The use of dark meat though not healthy but oh so moist and tender... 3.5 stars   Crispy Beef is nasty!! It suppose to be hot.. as stated in the menu. It is just covered in brownish sauce and those shredded of meat has no resemblance to any beef I ever have before... advice: don't ever order that! ... -1 star   Chili Chicken can be more spicier and hotter.. hotter in the sense of pipping hot... a 2 star dish.. not bad but not good enough for me to recommend for anyone.   The side order of rice is just warm to touch... and hard and grainy...   The deco and services here remind me of one of those small town restaurants. The young waitress in her jeans, wind breaker and dirty white sneakers does look really confused... service is not there.. but you cannot really expect service here.. cheap, quantity is what you expect...   If you into Indian spices and deep fried dishes, this is the place to go.   The search of what is Hakka continues...."}
{"text":"I will never come back here again.  Being a Chinese, I think this is a worst chinese restautant that I have been.  Everything is deep fried here, food are too oily and MSG must have been used.  I guess the reason why it is so full all the time is because that is probably the only chinese halal place in town."}
{"text":"I go here about once a week.  Love the chilli chicken, house shrimp, and green beans."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good at a decent price.  For four dishes, it was about $42 but the portions were huge.  There was more than enough to take home to enjoy for a few days.  Tried the house squid which was crunchy and tasty (tried to finish it because was worried that it would be soggy the next day but was too full). As for the service, they were quick and attentive.  Every time there was an empty glass or the glass was half full, someone would come by and refill the glass.  There was a little sink in the corner of the dining area, not sure if this could be used by the patrons.  The restaurant itself was pretty plain but clean."}
{"text":"I have known this place for many years but never been eaten there. I met some friends in the area and decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised! The sitting was comfortable, not over crowded like other Chinese restaurants. The food were big portions, great taste and cheap! We ordered chilli chicken, egg fried rice, Hakka noodles, Manchurian eggplant, everything tasted great. The chilli chicken is probably the best I have ever had. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"we came in and ordered dinner for two plus chili chicken. we came cuz a taxi driver recommended this place cuz it was like 2mins drive from my house(he wasn't Chinese. so I thought tonight maybe a good time to try it. I love to find new places close to home.). The place wasn't too bad. the service is really slow and kinda bad as they you have to call them all the time. the food was filled with sauce, so much sugar and salt. the food wasn't bad as it was edible. however, it wasn't Chinese food or good Hakka food. it was bland and non spicy. our egg fried rice was really burnt... U could smell it when the lady brought it and it had burnt pieced like charred rice in it.... you really can't serve that... not at home and never in a restaurant... this place really doesnt care about quality or freshness or anything rather... the place wasn't really to clean either... but not many Asian places are spotless clean, so I can't complain about that.  THE only complaint would be me wanting to pay but there was a dessert and it was fried banana and ice cream. I don't mind the desert... but waiting to 20mina for it, I rather not. plus I could've paid first.... but they just won't give me the bill... came by 3 times and just said \"oh you have dessert\", I tired to till them in both English and Cantonese cuz I heard them talking... that I could just pay first and i don't really want dessert t.t but they didn't listen.... so I wasted 20mins waiting and ended up trying the dessert.... 2 pieces of fried banana... and one small scoop of really sweet vanilla ice cream. ..  not worth waiting. ... I dont think this place caters to Chinese people.... we were the only Chinese beside the working staff there. the rest of the customers were Indian or white... so all I can say is... evem if it's hakka Indian Chinese food. . it's really western really fake hakka Chinese food. I've had better... I really don't see how this place can survive so long..  are the customers that come here ones with no expectations of food... or taste buds..  there is some serious health issues that can develop if you can eat that much sauce weekly even once.... and honestly this place feels like a really bad version of really fake western Chinese food.... the menu has no Chinese... it's all English .... no wonder no Chinese people come here...  Try this place with caution... it barely passes as hakka Indian Chinese food at all..."}
{"text":"I have been going for more than a decade.   I'd have to say that the quality has suffered in recent years.   It's hit or miss... not as consistent as before - especially w/the chilli chicken.    That said, House Shrimp, House Beans & Hakka Chow Mein remain one of my favourite dishes anywhere.  Chilli Chicken on rice for $8 beats Mcdonalds etc. any day for a quick lunch/takeout."}
