{"text":"Literally Closed...Not messing about here. Went for dinner, emailed reservations ahead of time, got a reply?!?!?!?!, showed up, and it's an Italian (sorry, Neapolitan) Pizza/Pasta place. Can't make that up folks...

I ended up walking in, completely puzzled of course, he said they converted about a week before. Have to give Back Alley a 1-star for not having the class to let people know that it no longer exists; well at least not in this location...and for keeping their website up with no notification of their closure/relocation(?). That email? That's one for the 'mystery' books...

Anyways, I'm about to put up a review for the Pizzeria that moved in...actually pretty damn good...look for it under 'Via Mercanti'..."}
{"text":"My favourite in Kensington! Food is tasty and fresh, atmosphere is fantastic and service is great. Love the grilled meats and seafood. 

They also make a rad homemade ice tea."}
{"text":"I did not order any food, but the place smelled wonderful, full of spices in the air, and the wood burning ovens provided a warm and charming scent.

The preparation counter is in full view and there are 4 wood burning ovens.  The place looked pretty pro and 2 chefs seemed like they knew their stuff.  I will try to check out this food in the future.

I ordered a pitcher of Sapporo = 18$ + 2$ tip = 20$

There was also live music, a 3 piece jazz band.  You will probably be happy if you come here."}
{"text":"I'm still amazed that this place has been open for 5 years, is in Kensington market yet has no reviews! 

We stumbled in here in search of a good place that would serve us both coffee and alcoholic bevvies.

Didn't get to sample any food but they do have a very interesting menu. Thin crust pizzas (many of them made with \"asian fusion\" ingredients), and lots of BBQ items (ribs, chicken, steak) which were also kind of \"Creole/Asian\" fusion. Pizzas seemed reasonably priced ($8 for a margharita, $10-$13 for most others) and BBQ entrees around $15.

They had a very cool and rustic kitchen set up. When you step into the restaurant, you can see the entire kitchen prep area and big stone pizza ovens. Stacks of firewood piled along one wall.

They have a good looking brunch menu which could definitely be worth investigating. Breakfast pizza for $9. Breakfast burgers for $8! 

There was also a live 3 piece jazz \"ensemble\" (three 20-something hipster kids) playing off to one corner."}
{"text":"I was across the street at Fada Scooters getting my scooter fixed when the smell hit me.  I love Italian food, Italian coffee, Italian ... stuff!

The sight of the wood fired stove was my first indication that I was in for something special.  But it was the stacks of imported Italian flour against the wall that confirmed it.

I was by myself, and there for the first time.  The waiter recommend I order a \"personal sized\" pizza that would be ready in 5 minutes.  I took his advice, ordered a pepperoni pizza and to drink, a Brio.

As promised, five minutes later, along with a bottle, (not can) of Brio, my pizza arrived.  

Yelpers', I've had a lot of pizza in a lot of places.  This was sublime!  

I don't know if the place gets busy at night as I was there at 1pm - but I imagine it would ... how can a pizza like that in a town like this not be?

I give it five stars."}
