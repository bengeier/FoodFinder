{"text":"our family enjoys take out from here. we get 1 meat dish and 1 noodle dish for the 4 of us. we have lots of left overs for the next day.. :)"}
{"text":"We go here often and we really enjoy it. The service is fast and friendly and the food is great!"}
{"text":"The wings are awesome, but this place needs a do over the decor is very old and dusty there's Italian decor mixed with Chinese  (confusing ) and there is this oder that has been there both times I've been. The owners really need to clean this place up"}
{"text":"It's really nice to have some variety in a Brampton, a city were your only options seem like Indian take-out our a meal from some cheesy chain restaurant like East Side Mario's or Jack Aster's. Had the Pad Thai Special to go and it was just as good if not better than Thai food that I've had from some hip sit-down restaurant in TO. Portions sizes were generous, which was appreciated. Brampton needs more food like this!"}
{"text":"The owner of bamboo sold the business awhile ago. I wouldn't say the restaurant was renovated--- Bamboo Gardens closed down and it's an entirely different restaurant in its place."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place, but of course I have to be a little biased because I know the owners. I've been coming here for years and as a viet/thai restaurant in Brampton, they do have some competition but they do stand out I believe mostly due to the fact that it isn't a chain/franchise, so they have the freedom to change the menu and experiment.    Pho is always a good choice. Sometimes I even venture off and order lemon grass soup, seafood egg noodles or a skillet of their garlic mussels (yum!). Portion sizes are great. I am the biggest fan of their spring rolls because they are amazing. Hands down it has to be the best in Brampton. I've tried many many spring rolls in my life, but never as consistent and delicious as Bamboo's. It's definitely a must-try.   The only con I would say is the language barrier between myself and the servers, but I find that to be most cases at pho restaurants."}
{"text":"I was very optimistic but as the evening progressed there were the tiny clues that could not be ignored which mean there will not be a second trip. 930 pm on a Friday night and we came upon the empty restaurant with a realty sign in the window. Once seated the lonely award on the wall was from eleven years earlier. Tea was cold. And my friend after ordering tofu pad Thai was asked if she wanted vegetables with the Pad Thai, really???? I ordered the seafood lemon grass soup. Lots of broth, a Tomato quartered, one shrimp, one piece of squid and three big chunks of bok Choy. Likely the same bok Choy chunks gracing my friends pad Thai. Which had three chunks of carrots. And three tiny pieces of tofu on a mountain of noodles. Disappointing is wholly inadequate to describe this meal and it was an effort not to warn the people who were seated when we left. Not to run while they had the chance."}
{"text":"Took my sis and family to the buffet. Great first visit for all. Niece loved the sushi, fresh and very tasty. In fact, everything tasted like it just came out of the pan. Price is right, food is awesome and service terrific. My niece (11) highly recommends the tasty sushi."}
{"text":"After hearing a few good things about this restaurant and their pad thai (which I'm addicted too by the way) I decided to give it a shot.  Who would've known that a little place down the street from my house, tucked away in the corner of a plaza, could deliver such delicious goodness.  I ordered the pad thai (naturally) and the bf ordered a combination that included mango salad, pad thai noodles, and chicken (I'm not sure exactly what two types of chicken it was). The pad thai was delicious and the bf's meal was equally delicious.  Service was great! Our server helped us get familiar with menu and recommended some dishes that would be to our liking. And the prices are also very reasonable. Everything came up to around $22.00 ($9.50 for both meals).   The dining area in itself is not extravagant but nice and simple enough to sit down and enjoy a good meal.   I will definitely be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Very nice. Very good for what it is. This is strictly buffet. It was $9.95 for everything, including soda, coffee, etc. You pay prior to sitting down. You seat yourself. There are three long buffet tables loaded with everything juicy and delicious.  The spare ribs were \"falling off the bone\" tender and sweet, but not heavily sauced as are most Chinese style spare ribs. I sampled a number of dishes, all excellent. The Bamboo Garden is surprisingly large. There a number of people there, which is a good indicator of how good the food is. It is airy and uncrowded, at least it was when I went there for dinner.  It was very clean, and I noticed that the food tables were kept constantly stocked and clean. I'd have given ithe place five stars, but I tend to hold that in reserve for more elegant dining. Again, for what it is, it's terrific. I will be sure to go there, again."}
{"text":"Food was bland and over cooked.  Fried rice had no vegetables in it and meat was tough.  We will not try again."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre... worst part is the false advertisement of prices! Went there once for lunch to sit in and eat the buffet, food was ok. Went back another day to eat at 3 and was told price was $3 more per person because now it was considered dinner time, so I left.  Went back one more time because we were on a budget & the take out price looked reasonable, well yet another unpleasant surprise, the price listed $3.99, WAS NOT the price per take out container. Turns out yet another twist... lady tried to charge the higher price again for dinner AND weighed the food... so now the price was $5.99 per pound?  All I know is for 2 styrofoam containers she said the total was $27!  Never again will I go here.  Too many bad surprises and innconsistancies."}
{"text":"I ate there last week and thought it tasted average, but on the better end of average, with nothing standing out as amazng.  Their Phad Thai was really flavorful and enjoyable, without having to use sweetness to add flavor.   Their Green Curry Chicken was good, although the sauce could have been thicker.  Their spring rolls were tastey, although still just average.  Their Mango Chicken was really good, but would have benefited from more than 7 little pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the area . The chicken wing are ginormous got 4 next time order 3 instead . Seems empty most of the time . But food is made fresh 15 min wait the norm . Try it for your self"}
{"text":"Sleepy little joint with a 10 year old running the front of the house.   Waited 20+ minutes for my to go order and I'm their only patron.  The lady who presented my order was very polite, which I appreciated.  Food was OK with the Orange Chicken repeatable.  Doubt I'll make the effort since I don't live nearby."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and there is a reason this hole-in-the-wall is one of the best reviewed restaurants in Brampton.  I recently had the pad thai and the amount of food you get for $11 is almost criminal. I forced myself to eat as much as I could and still had some left over. I also had the fresh vegetable spring rolls which seemed like a healthy choice and tasted like a delicious choice. How could veggies and tofu in rice paper taste so good?  The place is hardly visually impressive and could certainly use a makeover but cheap, amazing thai food is cheap, amazing thai food.  I plan to become more of a regular here. Would love to try some dishes from their Vietnamese menu too!"}
{"text":"Bamboo Garden is yet another one of your typical Americanized Chinese food places.  And that's the way I like it, folks.  Ain't nuthin' wrong with Americanized Chinese food!  I tend to give places like this three stars because they have no surpirses, but they're very solid and dependable.   They've also got your typical lunch specials here for about $4.95 each.  I orderd the General Tso's Chicken.  Can't go wrong with a good General Tso, y'know!  I started my lunch with a good egg drop soup. In fact their soup was so good, I ended up taking a quart home."}
{"text":"Hands down my. Family's favorite place to eat it even topped over the chocolate fountain at Golden Corral lol...it's never overly crowded  so u get the service u deserve food is always fresh my niece and I are here often price can't be beat ANYWHERE!!! Will remain a regular"}
{"text":"My measuring stick for Chinese-American restaurants are either S/S chicken or crab rangoon. My wife's is Rangoon and orange chicken. We have eaten here several times and never have we been disappointed! The rangoon has great flavor, not just cream cheese and onion powder. The S/S sauce is JUST RIGHT which is hard to find and the chicken is really good with zero bones/cartilage pieces. My wife always enjoy the food she orders.   Why not 5 stars? The place itself needs a LITTLE work and they could use one more employee to cut the long carryout wait time. I respect the hustle as only husband, wife and son are the ones running the place but one more cook or a cashier can't hurt and could speed up the wait.   Overall, after eating from other similar spots along MH2 (Mt Holly Huntersville Rd), this one and Red Bowl are the only ones thatv still have menus in our house....  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I guess we just keep coming at the wrong time of day or night. This is by far the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to. It's never full or the food is luke warm at best. The tables are either dirty or vacant for the duration of our visit.  I have given it the benefit of the doubt several times for conveyance sake. We will. It return."}
{"text":"**update: how does a Chinese place run out of wonton soup?  The last 3 times I've gone in or called, the young boy has said there is no wonton soup.  This is my favorite soup!**. -1 star for sad.  Excellent food!  Everyone here is really nice and very polite.  If you're looking for fast, that's only going to happen if you're the only person in there.  Mom and dad are making the food, and the young son is taking the orders.  I really like that his place, and there's a good chance I'll be eating here more than once per week!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy, my brother has a friend who works there so we went and tried it one time when my mom was out of town.  Pho, rice, pad thai was all yummy, only thing i noticed was instead of pad thai noodles they used pho noodles which made it more sticky and heavy, BUT still yummy.   Their mango shake is great and stir fry is YUM. the service was friendly but near the end they had kind of forgot about us but as soon as I waved my hand for the bill she came right away so that was great!"}
{"text":"I was not too impressed with the Thai menu. Food was average at best. Will try pho next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the same thing I always get and it was horrible. Soaked in greese, rubbery,chicken. I could even see burnt pieces of something from the wok. Not eating here again for a while."}
{"text":"A friend and I stumbled upon on this hole-in-the-wall restaurant. From the outside, I wasn't necessarily flabbergasted. BUT, low and behold, I walked in to a nice aroma of Asian cooking. I had gone at a time in between lunch and dinner, but to my surprise, I found a handful of folks eating away! Not even 2 minutes after self-seating, a waiter came out with a hot pot of tea and 2 cups asking if we wanted to sip. On a cold day, it was especially welcoming...He quickly brought out the menus, and everything looked amazing. From the appetizers, to the entrees, to the veggie platters, to soups, and even a LUNCH SPECIALs listing (available till 3:30PM)! Being a vegetarian, I was quite happy with my available options....not being incredibly hungry due to my first lunch at noon, I ended up getting the Veggie Springrolls (2 - HUGEEEEEEEE) in the clear wrap (super healthy) and a LARGE Lemon Grass Tom Yum Vegetable Soup. Mind you, I was more than satisfied (THAT's what she said)!!! LOL. But really though, it was HUGEEEEEEE (TWSS, as well)! My friend being a carnivorous, non-vegetarian, currently avoiding red meats (for lent) decided to go with the Lunch Special: Basil Chicken dish, which came with a good amount of Pad Thai (plain, but still good...kinda SWEET-ish), and a Side Salad. Being an Indian, we both were all about the SRIRACHA sauce, the other mixed blend on the table wasn't of our liking, since it was more like mexican chipotle style asian hot sauce. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, and would definitely go back. My entire bill (with enough leftovers to feed a pregnant woman) ended up being under $20 (it's a steal!!). I left a nice tip for the excellent service, and great food. And, to put the icing on the cake, our waiter brought only the best candies with our cheque. I forget if they were lychee or kiwi but they were so good, I decided to grab some more on my way out, since he offered. :) My mouth is watering just thinking bout my review. YUM."}
{"text":"My family likes it here. I like that drinks are included in price... 9.99 for dinner w drink is a decent price. There is alot of choices and for the price the food is pretty good. My husband loves the ribs. The bad is they dont seem to clear the table until u leave which i guess is okay since they dont have to get you drinks (self serve) but can make the table a little full. I do love that i can have soda w my dinner and coffee w my dessert w out paying for 2 drinks since its included."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices always fresh and nice employees. The General Tso Chicken  or the pork in garlic sauce are at the top for me."}
{"text":"This place is great and very affordable. Their crab rangoons are in the folded 3D shape vs a flat triangle...this offers more filling in each bite and just what I like!! The hot & sour soup was very flavorful as well. I will definitely be back...going now!"}
{"text":"This buffet straight up tastes like barf. None of the food has taste, and me and my friends felt sick after eating here. Even for a $7 unlimited lunch buffet this was straight up B-A-D. My lo mein noodles tasted like fried shoelaces. Go to burger king instead."}
{"text":"I LOVE Chinese food and have eaten at many a Chinese restaurant in my time.... This by far is the WORST! Rice was over cooked and chicken did not taste nor \"chew\" like chicken. Yuck!"}
{"text":"How do you mess up General Tso Chicken? How? Nasty. No flavor. Soggy breading. I took 2 bites and decided that was enough. The Rangoon was all cream cheese flavor.  Also do not like places that have their young children working the counter. Those kids don't choose to be there....almost a mild form of child slave labor, do you pay your children a wage?.....if you want to be taken seriously as a restaurant hire professional help and don't have your kids doing it. Based off the bad General Tso and child workers I will not ever be returning. Not a good experience. Not sure how you've mustard up even a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday afternoon.  Service has been great, the server's very attentive, and it's pretty busy.   We tried the mango, pineapple, avocado and coconut milkshakes. They were all delicious!   We also tried the sesame chicken, peanut sauce chicken, mango chicken and the chicken and shrimp pad thai.  We didnt wait too long, and I'm definitely coming back!   Now, i have to go walk off the food..."}
{"text":"Good food, fair price. It looks empty but its because most people take out. When we sat down at least 7 people took food to go and enough for a family. The food tastes good. My wife and I really liked the white rice. Next time will try the chicken wings, lots of people order those."}
