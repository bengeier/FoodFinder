{"text":"Ordered the 6 cheese grilled cheese which comes with fries.  First time, the fries were cold to touch and the cheese was resolidified on the bread.  Had to send it back.  Fresh order came quick, fries were hot and cheese was melty.  Not worth the $14 hotel price. Their Cesar's are quite good with home made Clamato.  Service very friendly, but a little slow.  No discount offered for the cold food.  I'm staying at the hotel, otherwise, probably wouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with a wag jag. The service is very slow. The food is only OK. Even though they have butter and jam on the table when you get there, they charge you 2.75 for 2 tiny pieces of toast. They told us they validate your parking but we had to see 3 managers before they actually made it happen."}
{"text":"This review is for T| Bar's Indian Lunch buffet.
Place: This is a small bar in Delta Chelsea Hotel (Yonge and Gerrard). The beautiful setting and great ambiance of the place is ideal for lunch with 1-2 people. I feel the place is still a hidden gem and should stay that way :)
Food: Absolute treat for your taste buds. The Indian buffet is unlike any other buffet. If you prefer quality over quantity, this is your place. They have 3 to 4 choices of dishes in both veg and non-veg categories along with Naans and Basmati rice. 
First round - have a little of things you like to taste and start enjoying. 
Next rounds - come back for the dishes you immensely enjoyed tasting. You can enjoy with focus now. 
The best is for the last - Variety of sweets, love the Rasgullas, not a big fan of cold Gulab Jamuns. The other non-Indian sweets are good too."}
{"text":"This Indian Restaurant is on the main floor of the Eaton Chelsea hotel on the southwest corner of Gerrard and Yonge.   Or you could look at it as the southeast corner of Bay and Gerrard.   

The decor is modern and stylish.   There is a lot of marble on the exterior.  The aura is suggestive of a place that is high class.   There is a full service bar that seems to specialize in Ceasars, although I did not partake.

I did go to the lunch buffet.   I had wonderfully cooked lamb that had almost all of the fat removed.    The chicken curry (they call it something different) was also well done, I suspect they are using a pressure or slow cooker to make it - successfully.

I will go back and would recommend this place as decent value for the money."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  Came here for lunch (Summerlicious 2015) with 2 friends.  Service was mediocre but the worst part was the food.

The theme was Mexican...  Appetizers, such as 'Corn Chips with Corn Salsa' and 'Chilled Avocado Soup' were good, but when our mains came (we all ordered the same thing - 'Carne Asada/beef tacos with a side of corn on the cob'), we were DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED.  The corn tortillas were so soggy to the point that we couldn't properly lift the tacos to eat them.  The meat was also quite bland.  My friend had to use a fork to eat the meat, and discard the tortillas.  I don't normally speak up when it comes to bad food (I usually just bear with it and make a mental note not to come back), but in this case, I had to say something when the manager passed by.  She said other customers had noticed the same thing, but her defense was that since the tortillas are made out of corn, they tend to fall apart (WHA? At home, I put my corn tortillas over the gas burner or grill to crisp them up a bit, so have never had this problem..  They couldn't do this here?).  She offered to have the kitchen re-plate them using flour tortillas instead.  We declined because we were pressed for time and had to go back to work (it took long enough for the mains to come out, even though the restaurant wasn't very busy).

Desserts were pitiful.  We requested our desserts to go (because service was so slow)...  Good thing we opened them up as soon as they came, because my friend discovered that they gave her an incorrect order...  My churros order comprised of 4 mini ones that looked like dog poop.  I had a bite of one of them...  Didn't taste fresh, was quite soggy with oil.  My other friend ordered some pineapple fritters, which were also soggy.

Needless to say, I will not be back to T Bar...  The food/service irked me so much that I felt compelled to write a review!"}
{"text":"We did the Summerlicious 2014 dinner menu during the weekend. Had the flat bread for starter which was jolly nice. The veal was disappointing though. I thought that it was overdone. The sticky toffee pudding was not the best I had. The plating was good, the portions were on the smaller side though. Would I do a repeat here? No."}
{"text":"Came here for the Winterlicious special with a couple of friends. We wanted something simple and not too stuffy. T|bar turned out to be just what we needed.

We were seated right away. The ambiance was very relaxing and our seats were very comfortable lounge sofas. Our sever was very attentive and our food arrived very quickly.

I started with a butternut squash soup, which was delicious. There were generous pieces of duck (yumm) and was not too sweet. Next was the Crazy Plucker burger. The chicken was extremely juicy, which made eating it not a pretty sight, but made my mouth happy. Loved the tartness of the mango salsa. For dessert, I had the Volcano Jar Cake, which is perfect for chocolate lovers. The side of gelato was nothing too special.

I thought the experience was great and the food was definitely worth the $25. In Toronto, it's a refreshing change to have a good meal without need to wait hours to be seated and served. I will definitely return and check out their regular menu and drinks!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chilaquiles on the breakfast menu. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Perfect portion size, flavorful, and memorable. Mildly spicy chorizo with lots of avocado, topped with eggs. I'd go back just for that dish. I can't say anything else on the menu is extraordinary- I had the salmon filet for dinner the night before and it was good, but nothing crazy. Definitely would go back for chilaquiles though.....SO good!"}
{"text":"Price is low- but the food and service were too. not what I was expecting to be attached to Chelesa hotel."}
{"text":"I had the great fortune of wandering into the T Bar at the Chelsea hotel last night. I saw their add for the Indian lunch buffet and Indian curry dinner.  It surprised me. 

I thought I would give it a try. 

It turned out to be a scrumptious meal.

I ordered butter chicken. They brought out a platter of food that looked awesome and tasted even better. Along with the butter chicken, there was a generous portion of jeera rice, a tiny portion of Raita, half a fried papad & 3 pieces of garlic nan. The aroma was delightful and the food was the perfect quantity and piping hot.

As I dug in, I realized that the taste was authentic and I could thank my stars enough....!

The best was saved for the last.
After I finished and I was beaming with happiness, I saw the check. The butter chicken platter was for about CAD 15. That was a steal of a meal in my book...!

Looking forward to trying their paneer makhani platter tonight...!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Chelsea hotel and open late.  Limited tap but the local Ale was refreshing with a hint of hops.  I had the lamb curry which bursting with flavor and full of tender, braised meat.  It was a moderately large portion.  Served with naan and some spicy chutneys as well as a side of jasmine rice that was overcooked and a little dry.  All in all it was just what I needed after a long day of travel."}
{"text":"This was my second time in this restaurant- mostly just for drinks. The service is exceptional and Ceasars are great.  Drink menu is good. But I have yet to try the food other than the pretzel/peanut mix at the bar-- complete with wasabi peas."}
