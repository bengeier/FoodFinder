{"text":"Food is really good, but portion sizes need to be a little bigger."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, but each time it takes probably an hour to even get food no matter how many people are in the party. That is probably the biggest con I can find here, just slower service. Other than that, the food is great and affordable and the ambiance this restaurant gives is great! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Kevin is amazing. The food he puts out is great. He goes out of his way to help and talk to everyone."}
{"text":"We ordered the two different pastas and were utterly disgusted. They were half cold and definitely overcooked. I don't know for the rest of the menu but I would not recommend the pastas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Best food around. I had an the sun rise burger! Southwest flavor with an egg on top! Lopes up and thumbs up for Canyon 49"}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel during our vacation to Phoenix and we knew ahead of time that it was a student-run hotel and restaurant but we would have hoped for more guidance for the students. Both times we went here, we were forgotten and both times we were seated at tables that had not been bussed or cleaned. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy either time we were there but the students tend to gravitate to tables with other students and stand around to talk to their friends neglecting their other customers. When we finally did receive our food, it was dry and flavorless. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich and it had obviously been sitting in a window waiting for the server to pick it up for a while because the chicken was dry and had very little pesto sauce on it. Our drinks weren't refilled until the server brought our bill and asked if we wanted more water. We said yes please and she never brought more water. Lunch service for two people from when we were seated until we had paid was an hour and a half. 

We waited a few days and decided to give dinner a try thinking maybe it was just that server or just an off day. We went for dinner earlier than the dinner rush we had observed while staying at the hotel. Once again we were forgotten and it took 35 minutes for someone to come bring us water. We ended up leaving because we were starving and neither our server or any other server was in sight to place our order. Would not recommend to anyone unless they had no interest in leaving campus and weren't particularly hungry."}
{"text":"I am a student here at gcu. I have gone to the hotel multiple times however yesterday will probably be the last time. The restaurant as a whole is nice however I have not got a server the last couple times I have gone that have gave me napkins/fork and didn't fill my water. I had to ask for my check multiple times and even had to walk to the kitchen to get myself a play. TSimple tasks have not been met and it's frustrating. The food is okay and because I am a student I don't mind eating it compared to the food on campus however if you are visiting Phoenix or looking for a place to eat do not eat here."}
{"text":"The food here is gross. Cool environment, but gross food. The pretzel bites were greasy with a side of fake watery cheese, and the BLT came with spinach instead of lettuce when we specifically asked for lettuce. Maybe rename it and call it a BST. We complained multiple times and nobody did anything. Just dont go here."}
{"text":"Ok. Despite working close by this is the last time I will come here.  I asked for a burger no cheese and to add mustard and mayo.  Of course nothing.  A dry burger."}
{"text":"A Sports bar type restaurant, but when you go at 7pm (they close at 9) you can't get a seat... So if you're visiting the hotel, you basically can't visit the in hotel restaurant unless you make a reservation well in advance. UberEATS it is.

Walk outside to get my food from Uber, plenty of unused tables in their outdoor area."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! Service was prompt and prices were incredibly reasonable. A great place to eat!"}
{"text":"It feels like a Marley's and has the acoustics of a gymnasium but the kids work hard and not a bad spread for Mothers Day brunch.

We made reservations but they could have squeezed our party of 13 easily without. Surprised about the lack of fruit for breakfast so bring your own. Buffet items were quite random but good for eating. Will go for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday the other day. It took an hour to get our food and when my pasta got there, it was cold. Me and my boyfriend shared a steak and that night we both got terrible food poisoning. And on top of that, we had a very kind waitress who was so apologetic about how long it took for our food to get there but they had a max amount that we could tip her, which was very disappointing. Definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"The restaurant is attached to the hotel and it is student ran with student workers. The menu has changed several times and they get rid of the half decent items. Have had several bad experiences here. Service is extremely slow with getting food out in a timely manner and on top of that, several times our orders have been completely wrong. Even a phone order at 12:20pm and getting there around 1pm to pick up, the food still isn't ready until 1:20. Yes it is student ran, but I think it's just the servers who are students. The behind the scenes staff, managers, and chefs need to care more and check tickets to ensure items are correct before serving or boxing them up and be more mindful of time management. When the food order is correct, it is bland and boring. The servers in general are always friendly and nice though and the only reason this gets 2 stars is because of them."}
{"text":"The BLT Flatbread is amazing! And GCU allows students to use their meal plans. Just another reason why GCU is the best."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Still new so I'm guessing they are still learning and making changes. Nice atmosphere! Server was attentive and polite!  Food was good and dessert was better!!"}
{"text":"I really like having lunch here! I've tried several menu items and enjoy them all. The bar is a friendly place to eat and I've had great luck with all the wait staff."}
{"text":"It was just alright. The food and service were mediocre. I ordered a burger, and it was nothing to write home about. Something positive about this new restaurant is the prices. I spent $9 for a burger and salad for lunch--that's cheap! I will be back to give this place another try."}
{"text":"As of lately, canyon has taken a ton of items from the menu, I hate having to take stars but not only did they fail to deliver the food at the time promised they also will get your food wrong. I absolutely love the students that work there they are probably the nicest waiters/waitresses ever! I just think no one is checking that the orders are correct and no one is checking the time. Super sad but here is what I ordered: Black bean burger with no bun, pickle on side and a side salad. I got the salad but didn't give me the Cesar dressing.and obviously my burger had a bunch and no pickle to be seen."}
{"text":"Wow. Came on a Friday night and expected a wait. They quoted us (party of 4) 30 minutes and sat us after 75 minutes. Then we sat at our table for 15-20 minutes before our actual server took our order. We were only offered water. That wasn't necessarily a problem considering we only wanted water. We just thought it was interesting. Then we all had the BBQ burger and the top half of the bun was nice and fluffy, but the bottom half was rock solid. It was like biting into a hockey puck. The service took so long throughout our meal that we were one of the last parties to leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here for a few lunches on Friday's and the food turnaround time and food quality is weak. I would compare it to the level of quality as you would expect at an Arby's. Staff is very nice but if the restaurant is half full anticipate a 1 hour wait just to get your food. I guess it's ran by students which is great but the quality of the product is no where near what company markets themselves as. If they increase the quality of food and figure out how to run a restaurant at more than half capacity then this place would be great. I ordered a French dip had to get it to go since it took so long which caused me to be late going back to work from my lunch hour. The French dip wasn't very good and was more bread than anything. You could make this in 2 minutes..."}
{"text":"Food is bland, had to wait 45 mins for a burger. Staff are all students, not the best service. Would not recommend come here."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Canyon 49 Grill and I lovee the food, the place is heartwarming and I wish they have a bigger serving size from the price that I paid."}
{"text":"Everytime I have come here, I have left with the \"I will never be back\" attitude. Yet again, Canyon 49 has shown me why I always say that to myself. The pretzel bites are greasy and flavorless, and the cheese the come with it is basically water. I ordered a Bacon Lettuce and Tomato sandwich, and had to ask for lettuce on it because it doesn't come with lettuce??????? Not only that.. but when I got the sandwich, it came with spinach. This is embarrassing as a GCU student. I wish my school was better in the public eye rather than a joke."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for lunch last Friday and really enjoyed our experience.  We were warmly greeted and quickly seated, the restaurant was lively, the servers were so friendly and attentive and the food was quite tasty too.  I started with a strawberry mojito (so tasty) and shared the pretzel bites with cheese fondue with my husband.  I enjoyed the 
black bean burger with tots for my lunch - perfectly cooked and satisfying.
Definitely a great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner if in the GCU vicinity!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best restaurant in the GCU area! Head chef Kevin is an extremely talented and hard working individual. Not to mention he treats every customer like a close friend and caters to every need or request. This extension of GCU's hospitality department is unmatched by any other establishment in the area by a long shot! Highly recommend, will be returning and bringing friends and family as much as possible!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for someone to service you, look no further than Matty. The guy is a boss! He remembers my name each time I come in to pick up food. Today, was no different Matty not only had a warm welcome but also offered to set a reminder on his phone to place the order in for me for an hour later so it would be waiting for me post workout. It was delish!"}
{"text":"Canyon 49 is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. Located near the  GCU campus, the majority of the servers, cooks, baristas and hosts are students from the University. I went several times over the summer and they remembered me and my family. Chef Kevin who is in charge, even went out of his way to make my daughter scrambled eggs during dinner. One of the servers at breakfast remembered that our daughter didn't eat any excess sugar, and when one of the cooks wanted to make her a pancake with whipped cream and she told him no, because her parents wouldn't let her eat extra sugar.... this was about four weeks after we had been the first time. The food is excellent, and they have a Great wine selection @ an affordable price."}
{"text":"I am SOOOOOOOOOOO Disappointed. I have been driving by the big \"Canyon 49 Grill\" sign on my way to work every day for about the last 6 months. I have been dying to try it. 

Tried it today with my husband and daughter and it was a HUGE disappointment!!! We drove up and were rudely greeted by the security guard- Whats Up? ... Um...What's Up?!?! No hello, how are you? Welcome to Grand Canyon University... how can I help you? He told us where the restaurant was. - Turn right at the stop sign\"- ...which was a circle drive. OK... 

Got inside and it took quite  a few minutes to be seated. We were finally  seated and promptly greeted by our server. We were surprised by the menu. It looked REALLY good!! I ordered the salad with grilled salmon, my husband ordered the jalapeno burger and my daughter ordered the chicken panini.  The server brought mine and my daughter's iced tea right away. It took a while for my husbands beer to come. 

Some time went by and we noticed people who were seated after us started  getting their food and ours still hadn't been served yet. The server told us it wouldn't be too much longer. So we waited a little longer. I thought maybe it was the salmon I ordered that was taking too long, but then we saw more people being served their food and other people who came after us were already finished with their lunch. By this time, it was a good  45-50  minutes since we had walked in the door.. ordered.... and we were still waiting for our food. 

I got up to speak to the manager who initially seated us and told her we hadn't been served yet. She promptly went to the kitchen to see what the hold-up was and by this time, the server saw we had complained. Well... wouldn't you know it?? Our food was sitting on the pass the whole time. The food was delivered and the server apologized and said she was just waiting for our fries. - That was her reason why our food was not delivered. 

We decided to start eating and my daughter took a bite of her panini - which by this time was COLD! My hubby touched his burger... COLD... my grilled salmon.. COLD!!  I got up to tell the manager we would not be staying. It was very frustrating. She apologized and did ask what she could do and we said NOTHING. Mind you ... we were hungry and frustrated. She said OK .. and we left. 

We ended up at another restaurant up the street - where we were greeted and welcomed and served fast... hot food and we told them about our experience and they could not believe it. They actually apologized to us for having a bad experience at Canyon 49 Grill. WOW. Sad. Disappointed. Waste of a good hour with parking .... waiting for a table.. waiting for food and walking back to our car... empty stomachs and  hungry.  I will not be back. Jerry Colangelo I hope you read these reviews. There are a lot of 1-star reviews. What a shame. Its a beautiful restaurant on a beautiful campus- with your name behind it and can be a wonderful neighborhood place- but  this restaurant has major issues. What a shame."}
{"text":"Kevin which is one of the managers had given us the best service!! The food was phenomenal and I would recommend this place to anyone coming to visit the area! We ordered slider with tater tots and the tots were perfectly crispy without being burnt! The chefs special of the day was beef and broccoli, which had a NY strip steak cut into pieces alongside broccoli and a sweet teriyaki style sauce. And it all went well together.. very satisfied"}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat the food was really tasty and fresh. The cost was very reasonable."}
{"text":"I would give it less than 1 star if I could. We've been here often and normally are okay with the service but most of the times have issues. We had an issue with a plate and asked for it to be sent back, and had a rude remark from the server so we did not feel she deserved a tip. Then after paying the check the server asked why we don't tip and told us that \"That is a bad reputation to have around here.\" Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times, and I have to say the food is okay. I don't believe the food is worth the price though. Also the menu could use some work. Considering the fact it has a bar, there is no like bar food. What I mean is at your typical bar most offer food items like chicken wings. Also they don't have a large variety for kids. They at least should have something like chicken tenders, or nuggets. I had the bbq burger, order medium well. It came out over cooked and charcoaled. It was hard to eat, and I stopped after a few bites. Also most bbq burgers come with bbq sauce, this one did not. The fries are pretty good here though. I also had the chicken Alfredo pasta, it was pretty good. It had the right amount of sauce to pasta ratio, and the cheese on top was a nice touch. But for the amount you pay you don't get a very large portion. This place is still new, and it is going to take some time to grow and overcome, and I hope they take a better look at their menu."}
{"text":"My first experience at Canyon 49. Their menus is very small. I ordered a NY Strip medium rare but it came out well done. And the steak was so small, it was a waste of $21. The outside of the steak did not look nicely charred either. The shrimp cocktail was a let down. It only came with 4 pieces of shrimp on a bed of lettuce for $8. Both food presentations looked like they barely even tried. Other than the food, the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but I have to be honest ..the food absolutely sucked was so bad we had a breakfast burrito truly the most flavorless thing I have had just nasty as were the potatoes. You are better off getting a breakfast burrito at McDonalds ..  (that's pretty sad)the reason I hate to say this is because the staff was alright pretty nice. the place looks like nice and like it could be really really cool. great outdoor area."}
{"text":"While in the Phoenix area over Christmas, it was a challenge finding a restaurant open on Christmas day. Canyon 49 Grill was one of them and we went for lunch with a party of 5.

Our server was friendly and did a pretty good job. We had to ask for refills once or twice and the food wasn't as hot as it could have been. The flatbread pizza wasn't hot, more like lukewarm, and my portabella sandwich had no flavor at all. Other than that, the other members of our party were happy with their food.

I was a little surprised with the issues considering that this restaurant is run by a university that has people studying for hotel and restaurant management. I would have thought they could have done a better job."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE! First of all, they don't even open the entire space.  You arrive to see an empty restaurant, but find yourself waiting 25-30 minutes for a table because the university refuses to hire more waitresses.  Next, the food is mediocre at best.  My burger was dry, crumbly, and a little burnt. There aren't enough food choices, either.  As a student from GCU, they should not be endorsing a restaurant that fails to even satisfy for the price.  Then on top of that, they limit the amount of alcoholic beverages you can purchase, even though the restaurant is off campus!  DO NOT GO HERE (don't go to the university either but that's a whole other review)."}
{"text":"This is surprisingly good for a restaurant attached to a hotel. Not too surprised though considering GCU does everything pretty well. I've eaten at their golf course restaurant and it was very good as well. I had an very good hamburger here. The nachos were a bit simple and did not have much melted cheese which I always like. The service was average but it's a pretty nice place - modern, collegiate decor. Friendly staff. Full bar."}
{"text":"We visited here for the first time for lunch today.  I will say I am not impressed and will not return.  I ask to order my meal off the children's menu and explained to the waitress that due to medical issue could only eat a very small bit.  I was told no. Not even a let me check with the manager.  Normally I would leave the restaurant and go someplace else that would accommodate me.  But since we were with other people I stayed. I ordered a regular item, ate 3 bites and was done. Others in our party were not pleased with the food as they said it did not taste fresh.  It's sad as it's a beautiful restaurant and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"First of all, the service is not that great. Orders are always wrong every time I have gone and the service is so slow. The food not to mention is always so dry!!!! The burgers always come out well-done no matter what you ask for and the chicken is always so dry! I have ordered their cocktail shrimp and the cocktail sauce ended up being just ketchup!"}
{"text":"The \"Carne Asada Burrito\" in the Southwest is as iconic as the hamburger in most US states. Ordered this burrito for lunch recently and almost cried from sadness. Turned out that Canyon 49 Grill has no idea. This burrito was a huge let down that should not be referred to as Carne Asada. No seasoning, no flavor, no heat, and no taste! Skip this place because it will break your heart!"}
{"text":"Service review-- This place is hit-or-miss.  I have been here a dozen times as I have a student at the university.  I have had some pleasant experiences here in the past which brings us back.   This particular trip was disappointing! The blonde young woman behind the bar, must hate people or she's trying to hard to be aloof.  I never got a thank you or you're welcome from her and service was extremely slow and we were ingnored for a good portion of our dining experience.  Our interaction with her was unpleasant to say the least.  

 The hotel was sold out this weekend and the restaurant was extremely understaffed.  I understand that this restaurant and hotel are run by the students, but I would have expected management to teach & train them and pick up where the students and faulting.  

We come here for the convenience of being able to pay with GCU dining dollars, not for the quality of their food or service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch in Canyon 49 on 4/21. I was disappointed that no one greeted us with any sort of a smile or eye contact with the exception of Will our server (I'll comment on him later). When we came to the hostess stand and my wife asked for directions to the rest room, the hostess never lifted her head and pointed and said it over there.
 
Back to Will. He was very pleasant and engaging. He offered suggestions on the menu, ensure our drinks were topped off and offered a to go cup for my wife's iced tea. I mentioned to him what we experience and he asked if we like to speak to a manager. That was when Mark came to hear our concerns. We shared with him what had transpired. He said we should come back for dinner as he guaranteed a different experience.
 
As promised, the evening service was completely different. The entire staff was friendly, smiling and greeting guests at the restaurant. I watched the team work together assisting one another. We saw Mark busing tables to ensure that customer wait time would be reduced. Cash was our server. Extremely friendly, engaging and a great sense of humor. The evening meal Definitely changed our perspective. The food exceeded expectations especially considering the prices (very reasonable). Good salads and the pork chop was great. 
Our daughter will be attending GCU in the fall and we will be returning. 
I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if it hadn't been for the initial interaction."}
{"text":"The food is sub-par but it is cheap. \"You get what you pay for\" definitely rings true in this instance. 

My chief complaint is that we just ordered our daughter (2) a kid's cheeseburger which the menu lists as $5. When we received our bill we were charged $7. We inquired about the price discrepancy and we're told \"I guess the price recently changed...is that ok?\"  No, that's NOT ok. If a price is listed, then you need to honor that price. If you change a price, then you need to update your easily-printable children's menus to reflect that change. Instead of honoring the $5, we paid $7 for a sub-par cheeseburger that our daughter took 3 bites out of. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I usually do not write reviews but as a culinary professional. Table service only touched our table once. No thank you, and cold in the approach to customer service. I went in at 2 pm and was forced to wait for a table when the service room was 95% empty. Great atmosphere and great potential, but bar food with poor service. One operator to another retrain your staff."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant twice so far. The first time was for dinner and I had a lovely experience with great service and food. The second time however was less than satisfactory. This time it was for lunch and I left quite upset. We had to remind our waitress to bring us our drinks and refills. She tried delivering our food to other tables before remembering who ordered it. I got a burger with pastrami. The pastrami was undercooked and the burger was more than well done. We decided to try and redeem our meal by ordering dessert. We orders a brownie with ice cream. The waitress asked us several times what we wanted before placing the order. Once the order was ready, it sat on the counter for a good ten minutes before she brought it to us. At this point the brownie was hard as a rock and the ice cream almost melted. It's hard to say if I would go again. Probably for dinner but not for lunch."}
{"text":"It was a little crowded when we went. It was move out week so I'm not sure if that's the norm or not. The staff was friendly and the food was good. Kinda pricey but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The staff was nice, but the food was just not good. Most of it was recycled from the night before -  not in an unsanitary way, but in a cheap way. Taking a trip to main campus for their restaurants is worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Canyon 49 Grill/GCBC for the past year or so. I must say that Matt and Aaron are the best baristas in town. They not only remember me by name but they always know and make my drink perfect. The food is amazing as well. Matt and Aaron are always full of positive attitudes, laughter and bring a different twist to my rather than stressful day! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!!! Absolutely God-Awful. I normally don't leave reviews, however this mind-bogglingly bad quality of food and service cannot go unspoken of. Long story shortened, it's overpriced, cheaply made food, served at the lowest quality. Our server was very nice, but it was obvious the restaurant was understaffed because the owners (just like the owners of GCU) are greedy and only care about profit by minimizing labor. The food was awful, the pasta me and my fiancé had was undercooked and hard, the mashed potatoes we had were cold in the middle and tasted crusty on the outside like they had either been sitting outside or microwaved. Both of the appetizers had been partially spilled as they were brought to our table, which we as a table noticed, however our server didn't seem to mind. Conclusion: please don't spend your hard earned money here, and if you're a student don't spend your dining dollars here, they don't deserve your money. This is an absolutely horrible restaurant, ran by absolutely awful owners and an awful school. Don't come here, ever."}
{"text":"The staff was super nice. However, the breakfast potatoes tasted a day old and the meat lovers omelet was overcooked and way over cheesed. The scrambled eggs tasted mushy. We tipped off the service but we were not happy about the food."}
{"text":"The service here is good but food always comes out cold. I only eaten here 4 times even though I am a student. I have had to send all of my meals back to get them warmed up, and I have tried different things on the menu. The only thing I enjoyed eating here was the cookie skillet."}
{"text":"Service can be pretty slow. Some of the food is good, I like the buffalo chicken sandwich and the burgers. I went for breakfast today and ordered french toast. It looked great but tasted strongly of onions. Clearly the grill needs a better cleaning before breakfast. I didn't get a chance to let anyone know because the server never came back until we were finished and I was too hungry to wait any longer so I just ate my onion french toast."}
{"text":"WOW!  Such a nice little place to get a bite to eat at.  I ordered a tea and spinach salad with grilled shrimp.  The salad was fresh and delicious.  The dressing was superb and was obviously made fresh and did not come out of a bottle.  For a quick bite to eat, this is surely your place."}
{"text":"We stayed here and ate at Canyon 49 a few times. The service was always great and the food was very good. 

I'll be back and will eat here many more times."}
{"text":"Food is average but what makes this restaurant a terrible experience is the kind of the service they provide. We were sent to the bar which was fine but we were not approached for awhile but when we were our waiter was not friendly and came off very rude. He got us water and gave us our meals and never bothered to check up on us after that. After we were done eating, we waited almost 30 minutes for the bill. When we get the bill, he has the nerve to circle tip suggesting that we need to tip his horrible service and I wanted him to know I was not going to leave a tip. Tips are earned, not given! I have absolutely no problem leaving tips to great waiters but he surely did not deserve it. After he sees we do not leave a tip, he prints out a whole new receipt and circles tip again and I made a point I was not going to leave anything so he can learn his lesson. Well another waiter decides to come at our table and suggest that we should leave a tip for him because they do not make enough money. I have never experienced a situation like this before at a restaurant. Our waiter found it important to let us know that he needs a tip but didn't find it important enough to actually do his job. I will never recommend this place to anybody I know. There are many different places in Phoenix that are actually worth your money."}
{"text":"The food is decent at best, they could definitely use an updated menu or higher quality ingredients for the options already given. The main reason I am writing a review is because the service was terrible. We literally grabbed our own glasses off another table and walked over to the water fountain and got our own water because she was so slow. I wouldn't recommended people going there."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time, always decent. I've had to send food back a couple of times because it's cold and I have gotten bad service a couple of times. 

Tonight we got the margarita pizza, chicken waffle sliders and the chipotle chicken pasta. Everything was delicious, but the flatbread was very soggy and not very good. This is what I mean about this place, they never seem to get everything right. But it's decent and cheap so I continue to come back to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at the restaurant and both times were disappointing. As a student attending GCU, having a restaurant off-campus that we can use dining dollars at is extremely convenient. However, this trip in particular to the restaurant was quite appalling. First of all, my friend and I ordered the tortilla soup which came to us lukewarm due to the fact that it sat in the window for 10 minutes prior to being served. When we told the waitress she took them and told us they would fix it. After about 30 minutes of waiting, we finally got our soups back still boiling and scorching hot where it was not even edible because of how hot the soup was. From what I know, this issue should have been dealt with immediately instead of making us wait an additional 30 minutes. I also saw staff be a little disrespectful in the fact that we said our soup was lukewarm. With a kitchen open to the view of the customers, I expected them to be more professional about the situation. This department is in the hospitality industry where the customer is always right. I should never, as a guest, see employees annoyed about a complaint I may have. What was even more appalling is that I saw the chef wiping his nose with his hand as he was touching my food. I was completely disgusted and shocked. This restaurant needs a lot of improvement before it can get to its full potential."}
{"text":"We were seated right away even though the place was pretty full. 
Definitely a younger crowd, but that's to be expected being located on campus. 
I was on a special diet and asked if it was possible to order off menu. After I placed my order the head chef came to my table just to be sure of the seasoning he could use. 
The service was fast and very friendly. 
Although it was crowded and loud it didn't seem crowded or overly loud. 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good. I've been here a few times already, mostly because it's a HIDDEN GEM amongst what is an otherwise bad neighborhood (27th and Camelback).  It's right off the 17 in the gated and guarded community of the GCU campus.
 Their Happy hour is (4-6 M-F) is a great deal, and the wings are fantastic (baked, not fried).
 The one complaint is that the happy hour deals are only at the bar, and not once did my waiter/bartender check back to get me a second drink before the hour (deal) was up - (4 of the 5 times that I've been there)."}
{"text":"I have been here about five times since they opened. My favorite is the margherita flatbread pizza. The size is good and the price is right at around $7. Plus it is a very quick dish, which makes lunch time dining good. They have a different menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My wife and I went for dinner and had the pork shank. It was $18 and initially I thought a little expensive, but oh wow was it wonderful. One of the best things I have had recently and it was worth it. The Sweet Potato Hash and Sautéed Spinach added to the dish and the entire plate was wonderful. My wife went with the three taco plate and enjoyed that as well. If you want some dessert I highly recommend the caramel corn house shake - it contains actual pieces of caramel corn. If you are going to a Grand Canyon University game or a performance at the arena I definitely recommend stopping here for dinner. If you are in the area for lunch, it beats the plethora of fast food chains that are on each corner. Come here, sit down, and enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Stayed at Grand Canyon University Hotel so ordered in from this restaurant which is right on site. I was very pleased with the food. Delicious cheeseburger on a soft tasty pretzel bun (never get rid of those!). Choice of fries, tots or salad. I chose the tots. All for $7. Can't beat the price."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise for a hotel restaurant. Went for lunch and had salads and chicken panini and they all were excellent. The ambience is beautiful and the service was excellent. Did I mention the prices were very reasonable. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Good for snacks, drinks, beverages any time. Bartender pours out a Guinness draft flat-bottom into the  glass,  instead of the 45 degree angle as is good form with Guinness. 

Otherwise,  they get it right in every way."}
{"text":"Really not impressed. On each occasion it has taken AGES to get the food... and it completely lacks ambiance, it's like eating in a hall.. a LOUD hall. Once the food arrives it's borderline - and certainly not good value at the prices. it's also quite a long walk from the parking area. I cannot recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor- beautifully decorated, fun outside patio with corn holl, tvs, firepit
Food. The good- all burgers and fries were excellent, tortilla soup, pear salad,good iced tea. The bad- tacos (lacked flavor and stale tortilla chips, only one kind of salsa which wasnt very good), turkey chili  (stale cornbread, chili lacked spice and favlor), caprese salad (soggy cheese). Good prices though . I hope to try more good things next time!"}
{"text":"Only need to say one thing: STREET TACOS! They are on the lunch menu and you would be crazy not to try them. My only regret is that there are not bigger portions of them on the dinner menu. Even when they were \"picking up pieces\" trying to get everything moving following a morning lock-down due to something going on in the neighborhood, they were calm, courteous, just plain fun, and ready to serve as best they could. One can tell how popular they are with the crowd every evening. Can't find where to post a picture or I'd show you a pic of our final night's dinner there. We had a serious feast and it was all fantastic. It does get a little loud because of the right angles of the room. What's more, it is a GCU run restaurant, meaning the people that serve you are likely students working their way through Bachelor's or Master's degrees in Hospitality and Business that require this as part of their experience. I have yet to meet a one who is not going to be overqualified just about anywhere else. Can't wait until I go down to Phoenix for my last residency. Hoping they took my suggestion for dinner plate Street Tacos to heart."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or a miss, one time I get a fantastic burger and the next I get raw salmon."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences at a restaurant I've had. Reserved a spot for my group of 8 people, and they made it work for us, which was great. We show up to the restaurant and sit at our table, in a half empty restaurant not a single server comes to the table to get us started. We look around and see the waitresses all huddled up and gossiping and arguing. After 30 minutes, we get someone's attention, only for the answer \"well I'm not your server, but I'll see who is when I can.\" So they didn't even plan and give a table with reservations a server.

 After a good 10 more minutes we get a server, finally. Once we place our order, the server waits a while then comes back and says, sorry we closed the section of the restaurant that makes the food you ordered early. Couldn't buy a tea, a smoothie, or any type of coffee. Which normally I can handle, but the menu is small enough already to close off a large portion of the drinks before they are even closing yet.

All in all, the worst service I have ever received. But, the food I did eventually get tasted good. I enjoyed the taste of the food, although it was not initially what I wanted to order. The poor service caused 2 of the 8 people to leave and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time trying for lunch with bosses pretty nice place on GCU campus. 

Very friendly staff as well, I had the Grilled Salmon BLT with a side salad, it was pretty good!

im definately coming again!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price! Very affordable with large portions. Attentive service and nice atmosphere... menu is pretty limited, but what is offered is good."}
{"text":"We are staying at the GCU Hotel and the food has been great at a reasonable price and the wait staff are great! I highly recommend the chili!"}
{"text":"We were visiting GCU for a week because my wife had to attend classes for phd program.  Since we were staying at the hotel, we ate the restaurant a few times.  The reason we ate there so often was because breakfast and dinner was included in the price we paid for the class.  Would not have eaten there as often otherwise.  First off, the atmosphere is fun and laid back and a great place to unwind after classes.  
The staff was very friendly in seating us and helping us out in making decisions on our menu selection. The first night our waiter was Cash who was very cheerful and helpful.  Unfortunately my dinner selection of the grilled chicken was not so great. A little tough and lacked seasoning.  Wife's chicken alfreado pasta was also missing something.  For dessert we were undecided between the lemon meringue shake or the caramel corn shake.  Luckily Cash helped us out by letting us know that the lemon meringue is tart and a lot of customers don't finish it, but the caramel corn is a hit. So we to tried the caramel corn shake and it was a great way to end the meal.  
The breakfast burrito here is very good with the side of potatoes and can be very filling.  The prices overall are very competitive with any other place if not better.  If they can work on the food, this place will be a neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Looking for good food, great service, and an overall good time? LOOK ELSEWHERE!! I have only had a good customer experience here once (my first time). Every time since then has been utterly terrible. Bad food, poor service, and limited, unchanging menu make this joint a one star joint. I honestly wish I could rate less than 1 star. Tonight I had the Chipotle chicken pasta, and it was GARBAGE. From a culinary standpoint, there were so many things wrong with execution of each dish that arrived at my table."}
{"text":"The service is actually about a 4-5/5
but I can not give more than 2 stars due to the fact that they are trying to pass off a poor quality food product as being much better quality than it is. You can definitely taste it. The prices are extremely high for the product being offered. 

The ambiance in the lounge isn't bad but once you move into the actual dining area.....well, that could use some work."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 4 stars because I love the look of it and Sam is the most awesome waitress ever! She's so sweet and polite and is on the ball. Our drinks were constantly refilled and she made sure we had everything we need. Best waitress ever! The only reason I deducted one star is because I feel the menu is a little limited, but I know since it's new that it is still growing. Another perk of the GCU Hotel Canyon 49 Grill is that you can use your dining dollars if you're a GCU student like me. :)"}
{"text":"Lucky to be working right next door to here now. What a great staff and decent food! They were very attentive to my gluten free needs. I got the tacos which were pretty good and the tuna salad which was also good. The prices are fair and they offer a discount for students and GCU employees. LOVE the ambience of the restaurant. The patio area is beautiful and hip."}
{"text":"Yo honestly I was not expecting much and it defied my expectations!

The burgers are A-OK and the bruschetta is A1.

The best thing about this place is that because I am a student at Grand Canyon, I am able to use my lopes cash to buy food. 

(Kinda) Free food is better than paying for it.

BB's Rating: OKAYTASTIC"}
{"text":"A friend who attends GCU treated me to dinner here; he eats here often because they accept dining dollars, but this was my first time. Overall not bad, but some menu items way overpriced. I got bbq bacon burger with fries ($11) and my friend the supreme flatbread pizza ($8/9). Food was served fresh and well cooked, but other than that was \"okay\" flavor-wise. For that price I expected better, so next time I'll probably grab a burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got a chance to meet Chef Kevin. Great guy and you can tell he cares about the food. I had the Southwest burger which was great. The milkshake was awesome. Had no idea the place existed and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for a friend's birthday, absolute trainwreck. Our server was rarely around, and we had empty glasses around the table for most of the evening. Ordered a Caprese salad, which was a bit smaller than I expected. The tomatoes were FAR from ripe, were bright pink, and tasted like nothing. Two of the slices were actually the ends with the stem part. Never seen a restaurant try and get away with that. Girlfriend ordered a salad with two ingredients removed, and of course got those ingredients in her salad anyways.  

Because we were out with a group of other people, I didn't want to make a fuss. Not like I could, because our server was again missing in action. When it came time to pay, it took our server 20 minutes (No exaggeration) to bring us the check, and another 15 minutes to come back with our cards (again, no exaggeration).  

Takes the cake on the worst service I've ever received.

Update 1/23/18: Despite the comment below, nobody has bothered to reply back to the email sent."}
