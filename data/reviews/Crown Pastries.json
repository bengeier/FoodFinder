{"text":"If you're in the market for middle eastern desserts, Crown Pastries fits the bill nicely.  They have all the pastries typical of a place like this, with a Syrian influence.  My favourite is the Esh al Ashfour, a birds nest with a filling of pistachios and cashews.  They also have a huge selection of other pastries of all sorts and sizes.  I like the Syrian variety of desserts more than baklava because they use less syrup, so you taste the pastries and nuts more than the syrup.

When you purchase, you tell the staff what size container you want, and you pick out what you want from their selection.  Prices are by weight rather than per piece, but a mini tray of a few different treats costs no more than $8."}
{"text":"Love everything we had here. Flakey, not overly sweet, truly yummy pasteries at very reasonable price. The weekend specials with cheese are especially delightful. Try everything! You will not regret your choices."}
{"text":"These pastries were delicious. The owner was so sweet to explain each pastry and let us pick a variety. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries and desserts-- so flaky, delicate and fresh! Not heavy or soggy. So many varieties to choose from, different shapes and fillings, most of them have nuts. Seems the most common is pistachio. 

Very friendly and helpful staff, they are genuinely proud of their work and are true artists in what they produce. 

No peanuts, so that's great for people with peanut allergies!"}
{"text":"I came to Crown Pastries on my quest to find kanafeh (a Middle Eastern dessert made with a firm cheese base, crispy, shredded pastry/noodles on top, and doused in syrup). I had it a while ago at Shawarma Empire, and I knew I wanted to do a taste comparison because after having it at SE, I craved it. That being said, Crown Pastries was the fourth and final stop on my quest, the first three having been duds. 

Walking in, I remember first thinking that something smelled delicious. Then I remember seeing all those beautiful trays of pastries on display and thinking that I wanted to try them all. I couldn't see kanafeh on display, but I asked, and before I got an answer, saw a tray of it sitting on the back counter. YES. I FOUND THEM. They were $22/kg, and I got a square for about $4-5? Something like that. 

I'm a newbie at Middle Eastern desserts, so I didn't know what almost anything in the store was. That being said, pastries + walnuts, pistachios and other nuts almost guarantees deliciousness. I have no idea what they were called, but they had what looked like little birds nests made of fried noodles, and they were filled with cashews, or pistachios, or peanuts, etc. They came in two sizes, the smaller of which was slightly larger than a toonie. They were absolutely gorgeous. We bought one to try. It tasted pretty good too. I like crispy, and I like nutty. It was a tad too sweet for me, but nothing a big glass of water can't fix.

To comment on what Zach E. said about having their pastries the second day, I believe I bought a box of either assorted day old pastries, or pastry odds and ends. It was $5 for the box of them, and I bought them so that I could sample some pastries I hadn't tried before. Even though they might not have been the freshest, at least I have some kind of start into this new sweet venture. I mean, here's the thing about food. The second day you have anything, it isn't as fresh as the day you first had it. That's undeniable logic. That being said, the assorted pastries I bought have been perfectly fine. I've had them for a couple days (I store them in the fridge and reheat them as needed), and I still found them enjoyable.

Great service here, by the way. I asked if the man at the counter would write down the names of the various pastries so that I could look them up (Wikipedia anyone?), and he not only wrote down their names, but wrote down a short description for easier identification. He then offered to give my mom and me each a cookie. The cookie I had was a cookie sandwich shaped like a five petaled flower, had a chocolate filling between the two cookies, and was topped with a very generous piece of hazelnut. I'm not a fan of chocolate, but the hazelnut made up for it.

Side note: To my knowledge, all the prices are by weight.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been on a baklava blitz as of late and that's how I like it. I've been on the search far and wide to educate my palette on this delicacy. I am not one for desserts but I do have a soft spot for baklava when done right. Probably because of the honey, rosewater or maybe it's the delicious nuts! Whatever it is when done right this stuff is heavenly every bite.

This place is located in one of the many ghetto plazas on this stretch of town with it's glaring lights it stands out! And also that banner that simply claims \"Best baklava!\". Sure - whatever that means.

As I walked in I am greeted by a young-ish gentleman in his chef attire with a gleaming smile. I see the articles on the wall; proudly featured in Toronto Life, newspapers...etc. This man proceeds to claim that unlike most, they make their phyllo dough in house from scratch. The very thought of meticulously making each paper thin piece of phyllo hurts my head!

One bite and you will instantly taste that handmade dough. Flaky, crispy, light and airy as it whimsically melts in your mouth like fine rice paper. Then it's an onslaught of nuttiness from an assortment of nuts like walnuts and pistachios. Finally, rounded out by the sweetness from the syrup that it's dipped in.

Admittedly, I love the dough but I think where they fall short here (of a five star) is with the slightly over roasted pistachios. The toastiness really overtakes a lot of the other flavours and is a bit overwhelming. Secondly, the sweetness is rather dull and it too is a bit much. Of course this is a personal preference as I generally don't eat too much sweets. And disappointingly, the honey didn't pull through at all or much of the rosewater either.

I applaud them for that great homemade dough but there is definitely room for improvements here. Still a decent Baklava though."}
{"text":"I saw this on a blogTO post claiming to be the best baklava in the city. I haven't consumed enough baklava's to call myself and expert however, I would recommend this place. I was able to get 2 of each piece for about $14 for a box, which was quite reasonable as each little pastry was packed with almonds, pistachios and other various nuts. I also like how they were open later compared to other bakeries. 

I would definitely come back for a baklava fix. The gentleman was very kind and great at explaining each item as I was unfamiliar with almost all. He also said they had weekend only baklavas, I'll definitely be back to sample those!"}
{"text":"This bright and clean bakery can satisfy any sweet tooth you may have. The bakery is located in the middle of a slightly sketchy strip mall, but the bakery space is open and welcoming. Large cookie sheets of different pastries and sweets sit behind glass along a long counter. You pick from three sizes of take out containers (that look suspiciously like what you would get sushi in) and point to whatever may catch your fancy. The price is calculated by weight, so you can get as much or as little as you like. 

Once you make your choice, you can grab one of the three small tables opposite the counter to devour your treat. The sweets were not as cloyingly sweet as I expected them to be. In fact, each piece had it's own unique texture, sweetness, and level of crunch. The different nuts used in each also brought something new to each piece, although some lent a more bitter flavor than I would have liked. I have no idea what any of them are called, but I liked the one that looks like the birdnest the most. A fun way to try some new pastries."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto and found this placed mentioned in multiple blogs and \"must eat \" list. Did not know what to try, but one blogger said, \"Just try everything!\" So, we did! We grabbed two of nearly everything and , boy, were we glad we did! Everything was delicious !!!!

Everything had just the right amount of sweetness, delicate,and melted in your mouth !

I've tried many Baklava and Middle Eastern treats in Chicago and this place beats them all.

So, instead of listing everything we tried, I will give the same great advice a fellow foodie gave: \"Just try everything!\""}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first about going to this place, as is the case in most places that sell middle eastern desserts, they often don't have fresh items. However, this place has amazing pastries and desserts, they were flaky, delicate, fresh, and absolutely delicious!

We bought Kunafa, a mix of desserts, and also Mammoul, and they were all delicious! The store is bright, clean, and everything is on display. Prices are reasonable as well, and if any, inexpensive compared to the amazing quality of the products. 

The man behind the counter (Sunday evening) was very nice and helpful. This place is now my go to location for good quality pastries and desserts! Must try."}
{"text":"Have tried baklava and other Middle Eastern pastries all over the GTA (and beyond) and this is easily top 3 for freshness, quality, and overall value. The service is also friendly and accommodating. Referring to the pics, I'm not sure which is what, although you can check out the website for info, but I can assure you, as many others have pointed out, that they're all delicious. For those unfamiliar with these pastries, many of them have common ingredients such as nuts, phyllo dough, honey, and rose water. Anything with rose water is my jam cause it tastes like eating luxurious perfumed pastry. All the pastries vary in shape (round to square) and texture (crunchy to cake-like), but you basically can't go wrong in what you choose. They're sold by the weight (as of this review, about $30 per kg), but here's a pro tip: if you go early enough, they have some discounted pre-packaged \"day olds\" to the side that are certainly not as fresh, but decent especially if you're on a budget. It's in a small plaza so parking is plentiful especially at off hours. Bonus is that Lawrence East in Scarborough has tons of good (and cheap) savory dishes for you to eat before you head here for some dessert."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for middle eastern desserts! The cheese roll and kanafeh are amazing!! The guy working behind the counter was nice enough to offer us a sample of the cheese roll as I was intrigued but wasn't sure how much to get. I will definitely be coming back here for all my middle eastern sweet treats!"}
