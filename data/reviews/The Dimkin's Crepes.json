{"text":"The crepes are fresh and delicious! And only $4 to $5 for large portions. The panini's are also good & make a great lunch option. The only negative is that if there is a line, it can take a while. But that's the price you for fresh food!"}
{"text":"I got the Nutella, banana and strawberries crepe and honestly it's like one of the best crepes I've ever had. Very cheap and convenient as well!"}
{"text":"Relatively cheaper crepes for the same taste you would get at demetres. Plus you get to enjoy the weather"}
{"text":"It's been 3 years and with a brand new food trailer to replace the previous cart, Dimkins crepes is experiencing much deserved success in celebration square.   Now with more space they've expanded beyond savoury and sweet crepes to offer, waffle sticks, a full espresso Bar and grilled paninis.   Stoycho, the owner is the nicest most passionate business owner you'll ever meet. Just spend a couple minutes talking to.   Love Dimkins.  Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time during all the events at Celebration Square but I'm either too busy, too full or have no cash on me.  So after having a big breakfast (eggs, sausage, toast, home fries), an Indian buffet for lunch, then a big 1/2 rack of ribs with two sides for dinner, I figured if I am going to engage in gluttony for a day, I might as well do it all the way.  Therefore I got a crepe.  It was the pineapple, Nuttella, and shredded coconut crepe.  The crepe was fluffy, had a very good amount of filling and just biting into it was heaven.  Much better than a Nutella crepe I had downtown that turned me off sweet crepes for a few years.  The best part about all this is that the crepe was only $5.  Very reasonable!  Will definitely come back for dessert when I'm walking by!  Note: cash only"}
{"text":"I always enjoyed their crepes (sometimes they can get too crunchy) but their churro style waffles are AMAZING with nutella, strawberries and ice cream. I'm addicted. Their savory crepes are really good too!"}
{"text":"More of a tip than review:-  I happened to be at Celebration Square last night since I literally live a block away and decided to try their crepes.$5 spent right!  The crepe were freshly made and was huge in size, it was easily shareable(saying so since I'm not a very passionate about sweet).They are fluffy and generously loaded with filling which for me was Nutella and bananas.And the highlight is the reasonable pricing.The lady making them was friendly and quick.I see myself coming here a lot during this summer!"}
{"text":"I was curious about this place and decided that today was a good day to try them out. It wasnt so busy when we came so the wait time wasnt so bad. This is pretty straight forward type of crepe/waffle dessert place. They are very generous with their nutella on my crepe and the waffle stick with maple syrup was also good too.  Also, they serve cold and hot drinks and some panini sandwiches as well. I would love to try those in the future.  Only bring CASH. They dont accept any other type of payment method.  Overall, I say if you have a sweet tooth give this place a try. Nutella is pretty much their thing. Lol"}
{"text":"Love how they haven't changed their prices  I've been going  here since highschool, my favorite crepe is the mozzarella"}
{"text":"Currently in Irvine and I'm craving these crepes so bad. I think it's the natural and fresh ingredients that gets me. If you're from Irvine, it's similar to Crepe Coop but much cheaper.   The consistency of this crepe this thick and he makes them perfectly golden with a fat splatter of nutella and a whole banana in it. To top it off I got Vanilla ice cream which tasted so fresh so I'm assuming it's homemade with light whip creme.   Soooo good. Please come to Irvine."}
