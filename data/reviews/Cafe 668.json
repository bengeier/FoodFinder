{"text":"No, no, no.  Cafe 668 you've got it all wrong.  The place was freezing, the service was just as cold, and the food was remarkably bland.  It saddens me to write this because I really wanted and expected to love this place but it quickly diminished from one-sided attraction to aversion.    I ordered from the large menu with anticipation, finally deciding on the spicy vermicelli soup while my companion opted for 'veggie duck'.  We waited hungrily before the soup arrived five minutes before the duck.  On first impression the enormous bowl of vermicelli looked beautiful with colourful vegetables and cascades of tofu on top.  But appearances can be deceiving, once I plunged into the bowl I realized it was just a big pile of noodles without any discernible flavour; all I could taste was salt from the faux meat that had been added in (without mention on the menu).  I added some sriracha to make up for the lack of spiciness, it was still pretty bland but I was grateful for the hot soup since I was still shivering even with my coat on inside.  The duck portion was smaller and also required an additional purchase of rice.  The texture of the gluten duck was interesting but the sauce was slimy and much too sweet; I was glad that I wasn't the one who had to finish it.  Blah.  Even if the food had of been decent, the prices are too high and the restaurant too cold to sit back and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"We tried out this place for the first time today for my bf's b-day. It is on a quieter section of Dundas, so we sat on the patio and it was a very nice environment to dine in. We ordered fresh salad rolls and spring rolls as appetizers, and I ordered singapore vermicelli (I was craving curry flavoured some type of noodles, so this was perfect) and he ordered spicy fried tofu (simply b/c he loves black bean sauce). Everything was very delicious, and the waiter (owner maybe?) was friendly as well. The food was homey unlike some other vegetarian/vegan places which try too hard to be trendy, and it had just enough flavour to satisfy your taste buds, on top of that, the amount of food was so generous that I had to take the other half to go. I will definitely go back there, next time I want to try their pho."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place, overall. The service was slow, the decor a bit cheesy, and the food was average at best. The fried noodles seemed stale and the vegetables were not well cooked. The best part was the deep fried eggplant dish, but the rest was really okay. I hate to rate family owned places lower but they need to focus more on getting the food right rather than trying to modernize their ambience."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through the TVA's Saturday podcast and decided to give them a try today. Even though my guy friend and I sat ourselves down and were browsing through the menu for several minutes, we were asked if were there for take-out by our server right off the bat. No introduction, no invitation to stay and enjoy the food (the place was empty when we got there) just \"you want take-out?\" was our greeting.   My guest enjoyed their king mushroom special which was served piping hot and full of flavour, but unfortunately my Summer House Vermicelli was stone cold. I asked the server/manager (I assume) why was my plate like luke-warm/cold. And he's like \"that's how we serve it\" but in this really rude tone. So I said that I don't like it that way and if he could heat it up. He commenced to throw a fit just as some other customers so conveniently walked in. Getting loud, he said \" I told you before this is how it's made\" trying to make it look like he explained the dish to me before i ordered (not true) and *I* was the one starting some shit. Yeah, okay buddy. I wanted to shove the plate in his face and walk out right then and there, but I remained composed.  I lifted the plate to him and he immediately assumed that I wanted to order something else and then says \" Well what do you want us to do?! The food is already cooked! What?!\" So i told him that he could set aside the salad, put the rest in the microwave and come back and serve it again. And he did without another word. Was that so hard rather than trying to cause a scene in front of my guest and the rest of the people in the dining area?  Unfortunately, even served hot this Summer House Vermicelli dish was as bland as water; there was food on the plate but absolutely NO FLAVOUR.   I felt very liberated in pressing $0 in tip when I had to pay. It was bad I had to pay at all for such uninspiring food and unconscionable customer service.  Suffice to say, I won't be returning. I'll stick with Vegetarian Haven or King's Cafe thank you very much."}
{"text":"Cafe 668 is the absolute best vegetarian joint in town.  There is so much flavor in every bite, it's outrageous! I have never tried anything on the menu that wasn't absolutely over the top wonderful. My favourite is the hot and sour soup an the crunchy noodles.  They serve fake duck, beer, chicken and fish and it doesn't taste like rubber. This is the kind of vegetarian restaurant that I would bring a meat eater too, because even without the meat, it's still all taste.  It's owned by a couple. He works the restaurant floor, and she cooks. they don't take credit cards or reservations and they don't serve booze, and it's still the best vegetarian in the city."}
{"text":"The food was fine but I probably won't go back.  Good:  Fake duck - crispy and fatty like duck, but tofu!  Lots of vegetables with the dishes. Tea pots to share.  Bad:  Some kind of bean paste in the wontons and the curry spring rools - it was mushy, not at all what I want in either of those dishes  Good service but I agree with the other reviewers that the restaurant was cold."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant! It is Asian fusion style vegetarian food. They have a pretty big menu with all sorts of dishes that contain a variety of vegetables and  fake meat. I usually get the Satay Veggie Beef on noodles. I love the flavour, and the textures of the fake beef and the crispy noodles.   Last time I decided to switch it up, and I got the Spicy Fried Coconut Tofu; it was amazing. I also got spring rolls to start, and they were so good too.   The atmosphere is nice too. It's got a modern style, very clean (the bathrooms too), and they have an aquarium, which i love! (and no, they aren't fish to eat haha).  I have been here quite a few times over the past few years, and I will keep coming back. The food is always well made and so delicious."}
{"text":"The veggie obsession is fabulous. Killer soups - you can't go wrong - order the noodle version and you'll have enough soup for two. Oh man, I forgot to take a photo of the amazing fried bananas! Friendly host, nice ambiance. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We had a terrific meal here!  Great soups, terrific dumplings and four of the best veggie dishes EVER!  All 4 dishes were very different and each was better than the last one!"}
{"text":"With a big crowd of vegetarians, you almost can't walk past Cafe 668 without being dragged on inside.  This restaurant has the distinct advantage of having turned me back on to veggie cuisine after a long stint as a recovering vegetarian.  Order something, anything, that involves spicy sauces or fried tofu, they really won't disappoint you.  That is, of course, unless you are an avowed carnivore with a hatred for soy or vegetable based matter.  In which case, go ahead and take a pass.  I was a little concerned during the Dundas streetcar line renovations, as it seemed like this sweet little place was going to be run into the ground.  But as all good things do, it has managed to thrive and continue on as one of the few affordable vegetarian spots in town.  Without the need for an upmarket designator, they have certainly cornered the market on what most vegetarians in the city will agree is a sorely lacking type of restaurant."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of vegetarian food (being veg myself), and a lot of Thai/\"Asian fusion\", and this is among the best of the best. Sure, it may be a bit pricier than most Chinatown fare, but dishes are always prepared fresh from scratch (so yes, you might have to wait a bit for your food - it's not fast food, people!) and the portions are generous.   I've probably eaten here about 30-odd times, along with my meat-eating bf and friends. I loved 668 when it was in its dingier digs years ago, and I still love it in its fancier abode. Quality is always amazing and dishes are consistent - we definitely have our favourites. Best to dine in with a friend or small group so you can share a couple of dishes, or if you prefer take-out, you'll definitely have enough for leftover lunch the next day.   I can't comment on the entire menu, as it's pretty extensive, though I wouldn't fault them for having a few less-than-stellar items. I generally prefer the non-mock-meat dishes (though I'm generally not a fan of fake meat anywhere), though they do the mock-meat pretty well. Best of the best: fried eggplant (with coconut curry or black bean sauce), coconut ginger soup, café 668 salad, spicy fried coconut tofu, coconut fried tofu (there might be a theme here!) and curry delight noodles. Personally, I don't find any of their \"spicy\"-indicated dishes spicy, though I do have a bit of a spicy tooth (is that a thing?).   I also have a soft spot for the owner/server (husband of the chef, who co-runs the place) who may be a bit rough around the edges, but is really quite sweet and funny. The couple have clearly invested a lot into the restaurant, and I hope that they stay in business for another 20 years. A tip for people finding the service gruff: try being friendly :)   Finally, I really can't fathom the negative reviews on here (and question people who've admittedly never eaten here giving 1-star reviews - it's not really fair to the restaurant or to people looking for legit reviews). Café 668 is the real deal - I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  We have dined here many times, and certainly enjoy the food.  But we usually have to muster up an abundance of patience and easygoingness when we decide to eat at Cafe 668.  The restaurant is run by a husband and wife team, and while the food is good and service somewhat friendly, they are definitely not an efficiently run restaurant.  Our most recent visit provides a prime example.  Only 1 table of 2 was occupied when 3 of us arrived.  The couple was already eating, and we were greeted in due time and left with the menus as well as water.  Much time passed by and we had to signal to indicate we were ready to order.  No drink orders were taken, so we ordered both drinks and food.   While we were waiting for our appetizers, another couple arrived and placed their orders.  Soon, their orders were served while we continued to wait for our appetizers.  Finally, appetizers for two of us came (and the couple who were there before us was served their dessert...more on this later), and as is our understanding from previous experiences at Cafe 668 - we do not wait for all individuals' meals to arrive before eating.  So two of us dove into our appetizers unapologetically.  We each had deep-fried tofu, and one also had an order of dumplings while the 3rd waited for the fresh salad rolls.    When I bit into my second piece of tofu, I had a bit of a shock to my tastebuds when I thought that what I had put into my mouth was putrid.  It certainly was not tofu, and then it dawned on me that I got a piece of deep fried banana (that I had just dipped into a mixture of hoisin sauce and sriracha).  UGH!  I do not like bananas, and even less when they they are deep fried to mush.  Others at the table thought something was wrong because I literally looked shocked and had tears in my eyes from the unexpected taste.  (I decided not to gross out my friends by spitting into my napkin, and instead gulped down my bite with a lot of water.)  With my amused friends consoling me, the gentleman at the table who had ordered deep fried bananas for dessert pointed out that he got one of my tofu pieces!    All of us were too nice to complain.  When the owner came to clear the table for two and looked puzzled at the left over piece of tofu on the dish of desserts, we informed him about the mistake.  He did not apologize;  he just shrugged and indicated \"she must have gotten the pieces mixed up\".  No offer to make up the dish;  nothing...and strangely, it was what we expected.  Somewhere along the way, my friend's order of summer roll arrived, and the she was immediately served her main course.  To our huge surprise, all 3 main courses arrived within 5 minutes of each other.  We consider that a \"win\" at this place.  They do a good job with the food which is the saving grace here.  So we're gluttons for punishment for continuing to dine here periodically, but Cafe 668 does offer something different from the typical asian cuisine.  And their restaurant is clean and spacious relative to some other places closer to Chinatown, so that's a plus.    My suggestion for anyone else wishing to dine here is to have low expectations of service, and to be in a laid back mood.  Otherwise, you will leave totally frustrated (as we have, in the past)."}
{"text":"We have been going to Cafe 668 for the last 14 year!! The food is amazing and the owners are great people!! Their curry eggplant, spicy pad Thai and black bean tofu dishes are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe 668 has been my favorite vegetarian restaurant for many years, going back to their small humble space just east of here. I love their current space. Modern and airy, offers the gentle sense of respect that is reflected in the surroundings as well as their food. You have to check out the incredible tropical aquarium, mesmerizing. And the food...I have tried many of the menu items over the years. I usually go back to my all-time favorites; summer rolls with the amazing dipping sauce They are moist and have many flavors and textures wrapped in the perfect eat-with-my-hands food. I always get two orders to take out so I can savor the yumminess another day. I love the Pho noodle soup. I have never been able to find a truly trustworthy vegetarian pho.  Cafe 668's pho is truly \"safe\" for vegetarians, and it is incredibly tasty and delicious! Again, there are so many layers of flavor that it is always interesting to eat. I also love the deep fried eggplant with homemade coconut curry, black bean veggie \"beef\", the steamed mixed Chinese greens-perfectly cooked and flavored. I really enjoy the different foods and although I order my go-to favorites, I try to taste something new each time. I often do take-out as my schedule just works out that way. I find that the quirks that I have developed over the years are not only respected and honored, they are graciously taken into consideration. For example, when I order pho I like extra broth. I like to have that for the second day as I always have way too much food for just one day, no matter how much I order!  Han always actually reminds me about my preferences and that makes it all even better!  So, this might sound biased, it is because I have always had amazing food from Cafe 668. I make a point of going there when I am able and am never disappointed. Sure there are things that I have not personally liked over the years, things I haven't tried because I do not like some of the ingredients, but that is to be expected. I figure it is worth trying as the majority of the time I am very happy with my choices, and wonder why I hadn't tried the dish earlier! If this sounds like an unabashed endorsement, it is! Comes from many years of wonderful food and appreciating the skill, love , respect and taste cooked into everything offered here! Thanks for being here!"}
{"text":"Great inexpensive vegetarian food, huge portions, nice staff and quiet side patio. Highly recommend sharing apps and a main. Didn't have room for desert but watched a couple enjoy theirs."}
{"text":"This place is really disappointing.  I've been there twice and each time I was not impressed at all.  My friends and I ordered 3 different dishes and shared them finding that they are more or less the same ingredients with a slight variation on the sauce.  The sauces are way to sweet for my liking.  The service was on the slow side but the food came out pretty quickly.  The decor was nice but it doesn't make up for the bad food.  Save your money and appetite, there are way better vegetarian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Large portions,  I was so hungry i thought it was amazing for the first 10 minutes..but honestly its just not worth the price tag considering the quality.. My dish was so sloppy and wet and barely any pieces of fake meat .. not that its $$ To use..  the deep fried mushrooms were horrible, i opened up the mushrooms and saw they used really old ones.. gross  yea wont be coming back"}
{"text":"i've been going for years.My favourites are the Cafe 668 salad and the two cold rolls...really great!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but Chinatown is cheaper.  You're paying for the fancy decor/ambiance and presentation.  My friend had vegetables & tofu on top of vermicelli and I had it on top of rice noodles.    A place you can take a date or to impress your out of town guests."}
{"text":"Love this place. The owners are very sweet and the food is fresh and tasty. The fried eggplant with coconut curry sauce is my go-to and the fat rice noodles are ridiculous. Don't go expecting a fine dining experience, but if you need a fix of vegetarian/vegan Asian nom noms...668 is hard to beat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! They have an extensive menu. I've been many times, and have never been disappointed!  The ambiance is lovely, and the service is good. Plus they have a wicked fish-tank.  Some of my favourite dishes include the 'Veggie Duck', the Water Chestnut Salad, the Coconut Ginger Soup, the Vegetarian Dumpling noodle soup, Veggie Obsession noodles, and the Crispy Fried Tofu (under main dishes) with option B) Spicy Black Bean Sauce (spicy)- carrots, celery, cabbage, green/red peppers and mushrooms.  Highly recommended... now I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"I love this place; not sure there are not more favouring reviews.  Cafe 668 is my go-to for yummy vegetarian asian fusion eats!  I love their cold spring rolls.  Their soups are comforting and divine; watch-out portion size are huge.  Curry pad thai is absolutely delish.  Get the stir fried vegetables, they are a must - fresh, crunchy and tasty.  Plates are served family style so bring a friend or two.  Price point is descent under $20 per person for a fully dinner.  Make Cafe 668 your vegetarian go-to spot as well!"}
{"text":"The Vietnamese hot and sour soup was outstanding. The broth was tangy yet slightly sweet and it contained a generous serving of veggies and fried tofu. You must taste it to understand it's beauty!   For mains, we ordered king mushrooms with veggie beef in a satay sauce and pad Thai and both were very good.   We can't wait to try the rest of their menu and update our review."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for about 6 years, and it never disappoints. The food is excellent. Decor is pretty great too, and the patio is fun to sit on because of all the unusual plants.  The service is great and very friendly. Hon is awesome and a real character, and yes, he is the only server. It's only a small family restaurant so don't expect your ass to be kissed the whole time.   Recommendations that never disappoint: Mango Salsa, Summer Rolls, King Mushroom Special, Curry Delight, Veggie Duck with Oyster Mushroom Sauce.   Portions are huge, so come hungry."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the bad reviews. To be honest, this place has the best vegetarian, pan-asian food ever. The food is full of flavour. I have come here many times and always enjoy it here. I have had the following dishes:  Spring rolls - Very crunchy and tasty. The sauce was bursting with flavour.The best spring rolls I have ever had.  Veggie Duck- You will not be disappointed. So full of flavour. Better than real duck.   Phat Thai- It tastes great, but let me warn you, it is really spicy.    Hot and Sour soup- So delicious, you must try it.  Mushroom Lover's - One of my favorites, nice crunchy noodles that are in a shape of a nest ( I call it the nest..hehehe) embedded with mushrooms, and other vegetables in a tasty sauce. If you have not tried this dish, you are missing out.   Vegetarian Pho- I could not believe how delicious this was. It is quite filling so make sure you save you appetite for it. This one is also my favorite. The portion size was perfect and it was not too salty which is excellent. I give this one a A++++.   Mango Heaven- I cannot leave this place without having this wonderful dessert. You have to try it. Plus, it is not a heavy dessert and not heavily sweet too. Just perfect. It is a spring roll pastry with mango slices inside. It is fried and then they pour some coconut sauce (made with coconut milk) on top. The sauce has some tapioca or sago in it, garnished with some sesame seeds. I love this dessert.  Next time I go, I want to try the dumplings, Vietnamese spring rolls, and won ton soup.   In terms of the service, it was excellent too. The man that works there is very friendly and is always attentive. Overall, the best experience."}
{"text":"The food just wasn't very good--not bad at all, just boring. We were the first ones in the place for dinner, having arrived somewhat early, so I was surprised that the service was slow. The server was friendly though, and the windows are good for Dundas West people watching. I won't be rushing back, but it was passable."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. I hate that I haven't visited here since it moved! Time to change that once bike season hits once and for all!  Such good value and lots of options for veggies and non veggies alike, though it's a fully vegetarian restaurant. Me and my dining partner had two non alcoholic drinks, two apps (dumplings - v tasty!) and curried spring rolls which were inventive. It was like samosa stuffed spring rolls! Yum!  For our entrees we had a soup and the king mushroom on noodles, both extra spicy. After they arrived I knew why the owner was surprised we had ordered both. They were huge. And they made a great spice level to accommodate our request.  I'm writing this the next day as I'm eating my leftovers and there is still enough for two of me!  For $48 for all of this , I was more than happy. Server, who seemed like the owner, was so nice too."}
{"text":"Considering the other reviews, I guess i've been lucky with the couple of visits i've had to Cafe 668. Both my visits (to their new location further west on Dundas) have been weekday evenings when the restaurant's been quiet, so service has been quick & unobtrusive, and the meals are served promptly - steaming hot!  There's a decent range of apps (and not all fried if you want something light) - the taro dumplings are especially tasty, and the deep-fried veg dumplings were great too.  I've had a regular main, and also a noodle main - both were packed with a nice and fresh range of veg, and the sauces were tasty. My only complaint is the small portions of protein. The size of my dishes was extremely satisfying.  The restaurant itself is clean and the decor is nice without being too much. When it's quiet, it is a great place to go and catch up over dinner - but can get a little chilly in the winter thanks to the big glass windows.  A solid 3.5, I think. Prices could be a little lower, and while the food is nice I think I would head to Loving Hut or Vegetarian Haven on a more regular basis. But if i'm out that way, I will drop in."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian.   But, I grew up in a vegetarian household, so I can appreciate good veggie food. I like good food, and good food can definitely be vegan, vegetarian, Kosher, etc.  Tip: sit next to the aquarium.  SUCH cool fish and shrimp and stuff in there.  When your dining companion becomes boring, you can stare at the fish.  (N.B.: my dining companion picked the table and actually told me that's why he picked it.  \"Now when we have nothing to say to each other, we can talk about the fish.\")  We had some soup.  The guy I was with keeps Kosher, so he doesn't realize it, but that soup was bland as heck and really REALLY needed shrimp.  The server brought things out in an order that didn't make any sense (plain white rice after we'd finished everything? uhhhh).  Everything was pretty standard \"meh\".  If everything was $3-5 a dish, I'd be behind it.  But overall, all the tastes were the same one-note, and I absolutely HATEHATEHATEHATEHAHTATHEAHTIEHTEIOARUAIODJSAKDJ cilantro, and I thought the rolls could use cilantro and was shocked I wasn't avoiding them like the plague.  Conclusion: lots of caps lock, and MEH."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food was absolutely boring and not very tasty.   I went to the new location with my partner about a month ago and was treated quite rudely by the server. When I asked how spicy the spicy food was, he volunteered \"Oh, we can make it mild if you want!\" At which point, I asked to make two spicy dishes less spicy (my partner and I were going to share two dishes, we also ordered two appetizers and wine).   When he brought the first entrée out, I tasted it and my mouth was on fire. I quickly called him over and simply asked if I could cancel the other dish since this one was too spicy and order a less spicy one since making the dish mild obviously didn't work. Even my partner who LOVES spicy food said it was INCREDIBLY hot but also not very tasty aside from that.  He simply told me it was too late to cancel. Then he told me that if I didn't like spicy food I shouldn't have ordered it! Well, that's what I was going to do until he told me they could be made less spicy.  After he brought the other dish (which was still very spicy but not nearly as spicy as the other dish), he didn't come back to our table once (we had finished our wine and wanted more, but couldn't order any because he didn't come over - lost profits for the restaurant!). He finally brought the bill after I went to the washroom without offering us coffee or dessert. Again, lost profits to the restaurant.  I highly discourage going to this place. My partner who LIKES spicy food was totally unsatisfied by both dishes and we were both horrified by the service and the waiter's attitude.  I highly recommend going elsewhere. Buddha's or Full Moon have much better food and the people there treat you like a human being for the same or less cost."}
{"text":"If you're within short walking distance of two or three other vegetarian Chinese spots, you really have to bring it with great flavour and freshness and I'm afraid Cafe 669 didn't fare well in either category. We tried three dishes - Cafe 669 salad, ginger coconut soup, and house special noodles and none of them swayed us from our dedication to Greens (they didn't even beat Buddha's.) They were bland and a bit blah. Too bad, we were really hoping to find a great new spot."}
{"text":"Having dined here before I was disappointed by my recent dining experience. We first commented that the restaurant was freezing and the waiter sternly commented \"the heat is on ...\". We found hair in 3 of 4 of our dishes and politely told the waiter only to be told that \"it happens\". There was never an offer to order something else or for our meal to be discounted to any extent. We had one last dish and the waiter said \"should I cancel the last dish ... there might be hair\". The bill came without anything taken off."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cafe 688 many times, but never before the move from 668 Dundas W, when I can only imagine it was one of the hippest little veggie joints in town based on the buzz I was hearing about it circa 2006/07, mostly fueled by hype from Now magazine.  These days things are pretty lacklustre at 668, which is now located at 885 Dundas, but kept the name. It's certainly not as bad as people are making it out to be on here but the days of having a constantly packed house are definitely gone.  The food is decent enough but don't expect to be blown away by anything. There's a large menu, but very little stands out. I've had the veggie pho on more than one occasion and I'm not wild about the broth they use or the chewy bit of tvp (I think) that float in it. It's huge though and makes 2 meals for me.  The decor is completely lacking warmth. Not only are there a lot of cold elements like floor-to-ceiling glass windows, a grey-white stone wall and a watery tank full of sad fish but the temperature inside is always cold, summer and winter. They blast the A/C when it hot out to the point of shivers and in the winter you need to keep your coat on, especially if you're sitting near the windows. I think this a major factor for why you don't really ever see more than one group dining in.  The dishes I've tried have always been somewhere between okay and good in the taste department. Nothing awful, nothing spectacular. I've generally had good service but the man who owns the place can sometimes be a bit rough around the edges, like someone who is in too deep denial to acknowledge that their business is now failing, in part because they decided to change it. I find the prices generally reasonable compared to your average asian joint, but at the same time there's better value and larger portions at other nearby veg spots like Greens Vegetarian.  The later incarnation of Cafe 668 represents the sad reality of poor business decision making. When you have something successful, you don't need to revise it. Right in the height of 668s popularity, they moved out of their smaller space on the edge of Kensington Market, near where Buddah's and Greens are today to a location several blocks west near Trinity Bellwoods. They changed the atmosphere and tried to make it more upscale and it's really seemed to killed their business even though the product is apparently the same.   I am actually amazed this place continues to survive off year after year with such slow business. The only time I've ever seen it half full is when I brought 20 people there to eat. I'd like to see it stay afloat but I definitely don't count it amongst my favourites. Strangely, I know a few people who do and I guess they are keeping it in business."}
{"text":"Pros Customer service  Location  Food was hot Design of restaurant  Staff Rose tea Cute mom/pop restaurant  Fish tank  Big portions   Cons Food was okay, but I've only ordered here once   Summary Great place to get together with a big group, and especially with fast service. Everything smells great and the staff are super nice. I would go again if my vegan friends asked me. It was a good experience, can't complain."}
{"text":"Who knows what the food is like because they are not professional enough to be open when they say they are open. I checked their website for their hours and arrived after they were supposed to be open, but the door was locked. The door had a big red open sign on it, repeating their hours. I called and received no answer, but once again, the voicemail rattled out the opening time that had since slipped by. I waited 10 minutes and called once more and then went to King's Cafe in Kensington, which was quite good and was professional enough to be open when it indicated it was open. I went on a recommendation but can't recommend cafe 668 to anyone."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  A good vegetarian option and I'm definitely going to need to try this place again (as there's SO much on the menu, and hey: I can eat all of it!).  We sat on the patio.  Very casual.  We tried three things.  My favorite, by far, were the fried dumplings.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of them.  We also tried the curry pad Thai and the coconut tofu.  Curry pad Thai is spicy, but dry spicy.  I thought it was going to come out like noodles in curry, but it was a dry spice rub on the pad Thai noodles.  The coconut tofu was decent as well.    Service was OK.  He was kind of all over the place.  Our rice came out 10 minutes after the rest of our meal."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check this place out for the longest time and finally got around to going last weekend.  It was very quiet when we went for dinner, they had just opened.  The interior was okay, nothing special.  The food was very good, but the mock meat was not what I expected.  The menu was expanse, but a tad bit pricier compared to similar restaurants.  I did not have a particularly bad or good time, but probably won't be returning again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan (hence the 4 stars!) Minus 1 star because the place is FREEZING cold and we all had to wear our coats!  I have been here a few times and I'm usually impressed. They have a very large menu selection.  I went here last night with a group of 15 people and the service was great (separate bills - yesss!!!)  I've said before that I'm not a fan of fake meats but I ordered the curry delight and to my surprise it did come with tofu AND fake meat and to my surprise it wasn't that bad! As long as the fake meat isn't the star of the dish its actually quite nice. The whole group was happy with their food.  I am for sure going back! The decor is also date appropriate (if you know what I mean, because I'm not sure I do...) ha ha..ok this place has a modern clean look. How's that?"}
{"text":"Very slow service (they did not come take our drink orders for about 20 minutes, we were all just sitting there) and food is really mediocre. Went here with about 10 people and no one really cared for their food. We also had to keep our coats on the entire time because the space was freezing."}
{"text":"Quaint patio, tried the Singapore noodles which for me were over sized and had far too much sauce in them. Don't think I'll be ordering them again"}
{"text":"Went here with my friend on a Saturday night. Place was pretty empty when we walked in which was great because we got a good seat! The server was very nice and friendly. We got the fried tofu as an appetizer, and the vegetarian curry fried rice, and the vegetable with fried noodles. Not a fan of the tofu only because I don't like silken tofu. But the noodles and rice were incredible. They were so delicious and the right kind of spicy. Service was a little slow but this isn't something I'm complaining about because it was so worth it. This was a great experience."}
{"text":"Booooorrrrring. I know vegetarian and vegan food can be delicious. I have had amazing food without a drop of meat in it, and I've gotten it for cheaper, and FASTER than Cafe 668.  Coconut Curry = good, but kinda hard to screw up. Every other dish was decent, but not worth $13 each. Small portions of food, but big glasses of water. They charge $2.50 for a pot of tea, which you would NEVER have to pay for in Chinatown.  Service-wise, they were so slow. Luckily I was there with a group and we could entertain each other while we waited for the food. Everything seemed to take forever -- I understand it's a husband & wife team who work the kitchen and the restaurant, but come on. Hire someone else, because you're moving way too slowly for a full house.  If you still decide to come here, ask to sit as far back as possible, or wear extra layers -- the place is FREEZING."}
{"text":"How on earth is this place a 2.5 star on here?  I am not a vegan, nor a vegetarian, yet I love Cafe 668, gone here probably 4-5 times and really really liked the food each time.  Good service, good ambience, good prices and great food.  Seriously the 2.5 rate here totally is not deserving at all.  I'd rank this place right up with King's Cafe, Hogtown Vegan, Fressen, Fresh, etc as some of the tasiest vegan food in the city.  If not better than those places in other regards."}
{"text":"I came here recently with a friend who is a vegetarian, and to satisfy my hankering for gluten/mock meat. Upon walking up to Café 668 from around the corner, there was a smell of stale oil emanating from the back, which was somewhat unappealing.  And, for about the first hour, it was just me and my friend there, which was very strange.  It's usually tough to find a restaurant in Toronto that isn't super busy!      The menu is huge - and I found it really hard to choose what to eat, as nothing seemed to fit the bill for a variety of mock meats.  However, for a vegetarian person who is accustomed to just being able to order a salad, this was great!  I asked the owner if they could just prepare some rice and mock meat, and they sure did!  This, I very much appreciated.  The Cotes du Rhone (2005?  Really?) was surprisingly nice and I also ordered some dessert - the sweet coconut cream corn dessert, which was like a pudding with tapioca pearls.  It was actually super yummy, and I would order it again!  On the negative side: the restaurant was FREEZING!  The owner had set out some space heaters for us, but it felt like we were sitting in a refrigerator.    Overall: fairly good food, nice staff, but the ambience needs some work."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I found the food a bit disappointing considering the price. Mediocre. For food that's just as good but more affordable for bigger portions, I'd just go to Salad King!"}
{"text":"As an enthusiastic vegetarian, I can pretty much name any veggie and vegan place in town, but going to eat at them is another story. After two years of hearing about Cafe 668, I decided to drag my mom along for a nice meal.  We were impressed by the decor. We were impressed by how the place was absolutely freezing. We were impressed by the menu (which is only Asian food, unbeknown to me at the time, not that it matters).  We were impressed that our food was disappointing. How could that be?  We both had an appetite to satisfy and found that our meals lacked a single item to give it umph.  I felt like my tofu was too soft and too doused in coconut sauce, the way your fingers start to get wrinkly and annoying to touch when you've been in the tub for too long.  My mom basically got a plate with some beautiful looking crispy noodles that was basically the equivalent of ordering ramen noodles' super attractive older, classier-looking sibling. In the end it was just served on a prettier plate.  All in all, for $40 (cash only!), totally not worth the hype.  PS It's not even at 668 anymore!"}
