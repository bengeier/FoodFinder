{"text":"I've been waiting for On the Rise to sell sandwiches for as long as they have been open.  So last Wednesday, I drive over, walk in and find out they only serve sandwiches Thur-Sat.  Bummer.  As it happens, the next day was Thursday and sandwiches were a go. My wife and I shared the Miller's Beef and House Burrata.  Both were excellent.  Surprisingly enough, as a meat loving guy, the House Burrata (Mozz and veggies) was better than the Miller's Beef. Really the only issue I have with On the Rise is the limited number of days that they offer lunch.  I strongly recommend trying them out for lunch if you are on the east-side."}
{"text":"This is the type of place you have to consider reviewing well, out of fear it will make the line longer on a weekend morning. Hands-down, this is my favorite pastry and bread place in NE Ohio.

If you're going on a weekend, you really want to be there before 10A, because much later and all the goodies are gone.

Their croissant is the perfect combination of flaky, chewy and buttery. Their pain au chocolat and pain au raisin are delicious. The breads are wonderfully crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside. And if you haven't had a Jennifer cookie, which is oats, nuts, and chocolate, you're missing out.

On the Rise may spoil you for pastries from lesser bakeries that you have loved for years, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Yum!  Highly recommend!   The bread, rolls, raspberry squares  and cinnamon rolls are my top picks.  This isn't anything I have gotten there that hasn't been great (except the peanut butter cookies - they were just OK).   I discovered this place after reading the back of Lolita's menu - they get their dinner rolls from here!  Very friendly staff.  You may have to wait in line a few minutes, but it generally moves fast.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Quick visit to Cleveland Heights, and I was sold on this quaint little place.

Nice quick brekkie of raspberry square and a cup of coffee -hey, the raspberry counts as fruit right?

The raspberry square was very crumbly and not too sweet just the way I like it, I walked 2+miles in the snow the very next day to snag up some more squares (this time raspberry and pecan) before heading back to CA. I will say that I preferred the raspberry square, but just a matter of personal opinion.

I would have to ask for some SOY milk for us lactose non-compliant folks because I do not want to die a slow, writhing death from consuming milk. The only options here are milk and half&half (not a fan of either).

I will be back, whenever next I find myself in the \"216\" a good bakery is a gem, trust me I'm always on a hunt for one."}
{"text":"Nice local Rustic French Bakery in the Heights.  The sandwiches are not cheap, however, they feature quality ingredients and are truly excellent.  The baked goods rotate and are of high quality."}
{"text":"Want to burn a big hole in your pocket?  This is the place for you! 
I came in the other day and ordered one of their sandwiches, the chicken salad.  $9 for a scoop of chicken salad and a slice of bread. It's not even a \"sandwich\".  Now, if the chicken salad was extremely delicious, then i would say it's worth your money, but it's nowhere close.  Another problem is the sandwich portion.  It's seriously enough for a five year old to be satisfied but not a grown adult.  I was robbed of my money.  I went again the following day to order a different kind of sandwich, and I left the bakery unsatisfied and hungry, wanting my money back.  Overall, go to STONE OVEN.  Better food, better prices, and better service!!  Stove Oven at least offers sides with sandwiches for a much more affordable price."}
{"text":"Favorite bakery in cleveland.

Great baguettes and pastries. Make sure to get there early in the day before they run out, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Simply the best! And not just because I share my name with their most delicious cookie. I'm actually more, much more, into the sticky buns. Into them as in will drive out of my way for them or call to see if they have them and then eat them on the way home. Yes, they really are that good."}
{"text":"We have been going there every Saturday for the last 2 years and having lived 25 years in France, this is worth it! Love their pastries cakes and breads!"}
{"text":"On of my new favorites in the area! The baguettes are perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My first time here I got the ham & gruyere with herb butter. It was super cheap and I made two servings out of it! 

Fortunately for me, my roommate snagged a loaf of the cinnamon swirl to take home. It's amazing! 

I will (frequently) be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say anything here that pretty much hasn't already been said. I love this place. It's always a bit strange when I'm there, because this bakery could be in San Francisco, North Beach in particular. It's almost startling to turn around and see Fairmount Blvd. instead of Columbus Avenue!

This is a Cleveland Heights gem, and the baked goods here rival those from any bakery in New York or San Francisco.  I wish they had some tables and chairs out front, covered by a retractable awning.  I'd love to sit out front with a newspaper, pastry, and cup of their delicious coffee."}
{"text":"I ordered couple take outs at this place. Food is good, I really like there bread. You can tell it is freshly baked. I had beef and pork sandwich. Both sandwiches  tasted really good.  I liked pork better, but beef tasted good after I reheated it for 15 sec. reason why I gave them 4 star is because of there service. There service is really slow and people at front register are rude, but I guess food makes for it."}
{"text":"On the Rise is one of the best bakeries I've been to on the planet (even in comparison to European bakeries). Nothing in Cleveland compares. Breads and pastries are delicious and very high quality."}
{"text":"Pork Bahn Mi is the sandwich of my dreams, seriously. The flavor is bright and intense with the richness of the pork and the tartness of the pickled veggies plus the perfect sprinkling of spicy jalapeno. I always want to try something else, but can never give up the heaven that is this pork bahn mi. 
Their baked goods are always delicious as well. Any one of their tarts/pies are probably safe for excessive consumption. I particularly like anything with berries and lemon, or nuts, or chocolate. AH okay I love all of them! Little bags of cookies by the register make great surprise treats for your friends or your hunny!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it coming from Vermont where we have some of the finest breads and cheeses but On The Rise is the best I've ever had. Focaccia, meesh, and onion rye are ridiculous! Oh and cinnamon raisin swirl.....foggeda bout it! The story of how they came about their oven is the stuff of legends! The service is spotty and not always the friendliest of folks and the sitting area gets too not and awfully cramped. However the product is Triple A."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Cleveland. The diversity and quality of the breads and pastries is top notch. I can't go in there without getting an Epi, and neither should you. The bars and cookies are decadently delicious, but what brings me back over and over are the sandwiches. Made with local ingredients, their sandwich offerings are both classic and unique. The ham and gruyere, the bahn mi, and the prosciutto with honey butter and arugula are in my usual rotation. I hope the house-made burrata with ramp pesto makes a comeback this spring. It's delightful. And I can't wait for their breakfast/lunch spot to open next door."}
{"text":"Unbelievable breads and pastries!  There are a few wonderful bread shops in NE Ohio, but this tops them all.  What a treasure!!"}
{"text":"I have come here several times and while I think the quality of the food is good, the personnel lacks in friendliness and it is quite overpriced.
I also preferred it before it expanded and was remodeled - it feels somewhat sterile now."}
{"text":"Chicken Salad was good but 9.00 is steep for 1 small scoop of chicken salad. The bread served with it is a little too hard to eat in my opinion. The oatmeal cookies are good though. I would try other pastries but I don't like that they're sitting on a rack out in the open for people to walk up to."}
{"text":"I generally love this place. Today I got a banh mi, which is already overpriced (but at least I accepted that before getting it), and got charged $0.75 for HOT SAUCE!!!! I was never informed that I was going to be charged for it or how much it was going to be. 

The banh mi itself needs a little kick, i.e. needs the hot sauce. It's a ok sandwich because the bread is great, but this does not taste like a banh mi at all. Expect a generic pork sandwich with pickled veggies."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bakery in the Cleveland area. French style breads and pastries are authentically prepared in this widely known neighborhood gem. Only wish that it were more convenient to the outer ring east side suburbs. Hoping the open a branch in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"My husbands family lives within walking distance of this divine bakery. Everything produced from this bakery is absolutely delicious. This last time we had their apricot and chocolate croissants and a cranberry tart.

Wake up early so that you can get the best pick!"}
{"text":"This extraordinary, French-influenced boulangerie is a gem. The owners and the individuals whom they employ are kind and earnest, with not a hint of haughtiness that typically accompanies similarly themed establishments. Every town should be so fortunate to have a gathering place such as OTR, a place that subscribes to producing a consistently high-quality product while serving up a friendly attitude and cozy setting. 

Moreover, OTR is a wonderful place to get work done. In fact, I frequently set up shop here and consider it my office away from my office."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a west side person and I consider going this far from home a ROAD TRIP ... but man oh man i haven't tasted bread this good since i was in France ... got the epi and cran walnut ... the epi was crusty and crunchy and the taste exceptional, if I closed my eyes I was back in Mouries ... the cran walnut was sublime.  I'll make the 26 mile drive again.  It is sooo worth it.  Got there at a lil after 9 am on Sat and the line was out the door, but it moved quickly and efficiently and i hardly noticed the brief wait, i was too busy fantasizing about what i would eat ..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bakery ! The staff is fantastic and the owners are great. They add such a special vibe to the neighborhood.  
I recommend the sticky buns with nuts !"}
{"text":"Yeah ok. I'm back because any rating less than 5 stars is criminal for this place. Their lunch sandwiches are unreal. The pork bahn mi particularly is out of this world."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is ridiculous....... first, the bread is amazing, we went in for a snack and ended up getting 4 loaves (a cinnamon raisin, olive, focaccia, and one with cheese) it's dangerous going in there with an empty stomach..... next, the coffee and tee was great, I had them make a half hot chocolate, half coffee and they even added some art in the foam which was cool..... last, the atmosphere is really cool, it seems like a neighborhood place where people come during the weekend, very homey and welcoming. Do yourself a favor and if you're in the area stop in for a snack!"}
{"text":"Great baked goods and sandwiches! 
My only complaint is the barista. I have been here four times in the past couple of weeks, typically in the weekends, and every time she is in an absolutely horrible mood. This morning as I was sitting for 15 minutes I heard her snap at four different customers waiting for their drinks. 
I understand that it's busy but being yelled at because I'm standing and waiting for my drink in the wrong spot is unacceptable (how would I know?)"}
{"text":"Amazing chocolate croissants.   Crispy and flakey and so rich.  Nothing like your typical grocery store croissant.  This is the real deal.  

And they have French Epi bread.  I've never seen this type of bread in Cleveland.  It's the perfect bread for Brie or butter.  The ideal combination of crispy, chewy and soft on the inside. 

What a great find!!"}
{"text":"The Ham and Gruyere sandwich is amazing. New Creation Farms ham, gruyere, and an herb butter on a baguette.  OMG. best sandwich ever."}
{"text":"In the suburban neighborhood of Cleveland Heights, there's only one place for my Banh-Mi sandwich fix: On the Rise. There is a pork version (I highly recommend!) as well as a tofu version for vegetarians. What makes this sandwich extra special and delicious is the bread - crunchy exterior and doughy interior that absorbs the flavorful sauce. I also love the cafe's house coffee - never bitter, always perfect temperature (hot enough but not scorching). The coffee pairs well with the croissant if you are looking for something flaky and buttery, or the lemon bar if you are looking for sweet and tarty with a foundational crunch.

Side note - hours are shorter on the weekends, especially Sundays. Closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"The breads and pastries are excellent! You can taste the passion that goes into them. 
I'm less than thrilled with the service, though. Although I go in at least once a week, the people up front are very indifferent toward you unless you're a regular who they know. Not rude, but not friendly. Luckily most customers are nice to chat with at the big community table."}
{"text":"It's a nice neighborhood place that's got a line out the door at 8:00 on a Sunday morning, kids and mutts a plenty clustered around tables on the street, and a nice big communal table inside.  To say nothing of the pastries and breads -- very fresh and tasty -- and the coffee, which hit just the right note after waking up with the wee one at 6:45am.  

On the Rise made me long, a little bit, for life in the suburbs. I'll be pleased to get back to the Big Smoke, but in the meantime, I was pleased to take a morning breather at this oasis of refined taste and local color."}
{"text":"The Jennifer cookie is my all time favorite! We love coming in for a coffee and some bakery! Sandwiches are great too!"}
{"text":"After a quick scan over the other reviews, it seems that another 5 star review about how great this bread is would be overkill. Yeah, it's great, worth a trip from anywhere in NEO to get, blah, blah, blah. 

But while we're here, let's talk about some banh mi. Pulled pork, mayonnaise, pickled radish and carrot, cilantro and jalapeno, all wrapped in a crusty baguette. I've made banh mi myself, and had it at several other restaurants in town, and On the Rise's is in a league of its own. When I'm on the East side for lunch, that is my go to."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I came here on a lunch break since it had such good reviews and I was craving fresh bread. When you walk in, it feels like you're entering a rustic, cutesy little store. The bread is on display in baskets and wooden shelves. And the smell is heavenly.

I got a ham and guyere sandwich and a roasted onion focaccia. The sandwich came on a baguette and it was super crunchy on the outside and delightfully soft and fluffy on the inside. It was packed with some awesome ham and lots of guyere--I know everyone will disagree with me here, but I'm not the type of person to have lots of meat and cheese in my sandwiches so I would have preferred less of both. I should have taken half of it and made a new sandwich out of it, but I was too busy chomping it down to care. 

As for the focaccia, wow! It was tasty and fresh and had the right amount of onions on top. I got the small ($2.25) instead of the large because they ran out of the large by 11:30am. And I can see why! It's delicious!!! I could totally eat this all day. But the small ended up being the perfect size for me anyway. It's about 8\" in diameter and could serve as its own snack or small meal for the carb lovers out there.

I'm totally coming back and picking up whatever random breads they have. They have a ton, and I'm glad I found my new go-to bakery!"}
{"text":"I came for a bahn-mi but got distracted by the special - brisket with a poblano relish & arugula - accompanied by a Meyer lemon soda and finished with a Jennifer cookie. I would eat any sandwich on the bun I got ... absolutely delicious. I will be back to this friendly, sunny space to enjoy more of their yeasty yumminess."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Bakery in Cleveland!!! The Baguettes are crispy on the outside and that perfect soft rich consistency on the inside. The Olive Bread is peppery, begging to be dipped in olive oil with dinner.

The specials will keep you coming back Friday and Saturday. Why?
Challah. You decide whether you like golden raisins or not. If you are there on a Friday you MUST get a Challah.
Fougasse - This is the reason to get up early on Saturday mornings! Sold-out by 9!!!

What is the best? The Cinnamon Raisin bread is to die for! Get there early and enjoy it hot or make the best French Toast ever. If you love cookies, try the Chocolate Chip and the Jennifer Cookie (kind of like an everything cookie, but strangely delicious). My favorite is the Blondie, it is moist and rich with delicate undertones of brown sugar. This Blondie will ruin your ability to casually order a Blondie at a random bakery.

{"text":"On the Rise is still amazing and still 5 stars. My review update is to comment on two things:

1. SANDWICHES. DROOL. They expanded their menu a few years ago to begin including sandwiches. Anything on this bread is worth it, but they do an especially good job of finding fresh ingredients and combining good flavors. My favorite is definitely the burrata vegetarian sandwich, using local Snowville cream, ramp pesto, arugula... could it get any better?

2. Expansion - they have also since expanded their space to include a larger dining area. They've also updated their look to be a little more modern - think subway tiles, etc. 

I love going by On the Rise and seeing the windows fogged up from the baked goods and the people enjoying them. We roll in here to pick up their fresh baguettes (same price or cheaper than groceries) and when we want to treat ourselves, the pastries!"}
{"text":"Ahhh ... my neighborhood bakery. I live around the corner and buy my bread here. They're best known for their sticky buns. Though, they run out fast, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Looking for a unique bakery with delicious pastries and bread? This is your place! On the Rise is a quaint bakery located in a quiet Cleveland Heights neighborhood. With this said, parking can be slightly difficult. If you come here on a non-busy weekday, there are plenty of street parking nearby! 

I ordered the Jennifer cookies (one of their most popular items!) and banh mi. The Jennifer cookies bring your homemade chocolate chip cookies to a whole new level! Each bite was filled with multiple chocolate chips and nuts. Mmmm mmm good :) These cookies are also quite dense! Even though they were so delicious, I could barely finish one cookie in one sitting! By the way, these cookies are NOT available on Tuesdays! 

I'm pleasantly surprised by how delicious the banh mi turned out to be! It's made similar to a Vietnamese banh mi. The only differences are that On the Rise salted the pickled carrots/radish (rather than sweetened), used chunks of beef (rather than slices of meat), and used French baguettes! The baguette was so soft and the beef was spiced just right! The only downside about the bahn mi was that the salty pickled vegetables were tooooooo salty! I ended up picking out half of them in order to thoroughly enjoy my sandwich! Also, this one banh mi costs the same as 3 banh mi's at Park to Shop. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Yes.

I'll definitely be coming back for some more yummy treats!"}
{"text":"Prior to moving to University Heights about a year and a half ago, I hadn't heard of On the Rise. Fortunately I was introduced to their artisan breads and pastries via an early morning work event and haven't looked back since.

On the Rise provides a wide selection of freshly baked breads, cookies, and pastries. Getting up early on a Sunday to pick up a box full of their expertly baked croissants, raspberry almond squares, and cinnamon buns is an easy way to get your day off to  a good start.

Though they do have minimal indoor seating and a handful of outdoor tables, I've always gotten my pastries to go. They tend to be very crowded on weekend mornings (8:30-10:30), but the staff does a good job of keeping the line moving. I would recommend coming early as they often sell out of particular items. If you favor a Cinnabon or Pillsbury style cinnamon bun, you may not be so wowed by their offerings. But, if you like your pastries to be light and flaky with  subtle, never overwhelming, sweetness, then On the Rise should be a perfect fit.

The prices at On the Rise are moderate; I can typically pick up half a dozen different pastries (the perfect addition to any breakfast/brunch) for around $20. They do accept credit cards, but have a minimum charge limit, so be sure to have cash on hand if you're just stopping by for a single item."}
{"text":"I. love. bread.  

This is both a gift and a curse.  A gift because some people can't eat bread and I feel lucky because I can.  A curse because I will literally stuff my face with  their rustic italian round loaf until I puke.  Thankfully, I have to go out of my way to get to On the Rise and therefore I do not spend all day eating delicious bread...or tarts...or cookies...or blondies...or brownies.   I seriously feel like a drug addict when I go to this place.  It's impossible to say no!"}
{"text":"Great authentic artisan breads, and the sandwiches are out of this world. The pork Bahn Mi is unbelievable. This place is a 45 min drive for me, but worth it."}
{"text":"On The Rise has risen, and hopefully does not plan to stop rising soon. Tucked snugly on Fairmount between a few independent shops, this local gem has become a bready staple in quite a few Clevelanders' early morning routines. 

Tip: parking lot in the back through the nearest side street. Plan on getting there before they run out of croissants - usually well before noon. Also - extra napkins are a must. And some water, tea, or coffee helps you swallow those delicious crumbs. 

We visit On The Rise on our morning commute to pick up a savory, buttery croissant - easily one of their best creations. They are expertly made, delicious and flakey every time. I am gluten-sensitive and still make the drive to get one of these, impending gut destruction and all. 

Why the knock in stars, then? Service is repeatedly rude, inattentive. At first, you give the sultry hostess the benefit of the doubt - maybe she's having a bad day. A fly in the dough. Too busy of a morning. But when it's a regularly calloused face taking your order and delivering your bread, snobby and irritable, you get tired of it. Minus one star - learn to smile, ladies, please. 

Second - the seating is terrible. If it's not warm and sunny outdoors, you are restricted to two tables, which are almost never clean nor free. We sit outside and attempt a croissant breakfast as the Cleveland winds whip the pastries out of our hands. The sparrows rejoice. Not my favorite spot in terms of vibe nor atmosphere. 

In addition, On The Rise is hit or miss. That is to say that some of their breads are delectable beyond a doubt while others are just... nasty. I had a lemon square a few months ago that reeked of eggs. I always pull food up to my nose before I taste it (a habit the picky eater in me will never outgrow), and I actually threw this pastry away after one tentative bite. This was doubly unfortunate to me because I am broke, I am a student, and the square was close to $4 while not even four inches. I don't mind splurging so long as I can swallow, thank you! 

On The Rise, you're the best in Cleveland, so don't stop rising soon. A fix in service and more attention to your less popular menu items will do you well. A reflection on the dining experience in your shop would also do wonders."}
{"text":"I visited here on a Saturday afternoon after having brunch next door.

Walking in the door, the smell of rich flour washed over me, taking me directly to carbland (coincidentally one of my favorite places). The staff was lovely as well; they were extremely accommodating and thoughtful throughout my brief visit. While here, I bought an apricot croissant, a chocolate croissant, a baguette, and two loaves of bread (sourdough and another I can't remember). To speak of each item:

Apricot croissant: Flakey, deliciously crispy, and filled with absolutely delicious apricot jam that complemented the pastry well. 

Chocolate croissant: I made the mistake of eating this the day after I purchased it, but it was still delicious albeit a bit less fresh. My fault! Learned my lesson! next time I'll just visit twice in one weekend. 

Baguette: Perfectly outer crust and delicious inside.

Loaves: Delicious, perfectly freezable, and came with freezer bags. 

I am delighted to have the chance to visit again this weekend."}
{"text":"We've been enjoying the delicious offerings here during the winter holidays 2015-16.  Everything is so good here and enjoyed the introduction to the Equator Estates brand of coffee; excellent pairing!  Almost pacing outside the door waiting for the reopening after the new year to try the quiche.  My wife and I featured quiche for a Christmas brunch with her mom but we used a pie from WholeFoods, so I wanted to taste the difference.  We shared a slice of the Vegetable and the Loraine. Our critique:  Loved the thick flakey crust and the texture but found it to be a tad too salty.
All in all this bakery is a gold mine for the area.  My wife said she's glad we don't live closer (we're in South Euclid) because she would be there Every day!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best bread & pastries in Cleveland!  Where to start?  All scones -- pear-walnut-ginger are my faves.  They strike a balance between the overly fluffy, cakey and crumbly-dry scones I've had in other places.  I heard that yogurt is a secret ingredient?  Jennifer Cookies, as someone else mentioned earlier.  BREADS, of course.  Chewy, crisp (but not hard enough to bruise your palate!) crusts; tender, airy and just-right stretchy, elastic chewiness inside.  Best eaten plain to enjoy pure bread integrity.  Yum.  Bread and water?  I could live on it if it's from On the Rise.  Plus, a few dog-friendly tables outside.  Get there early or you'll miss the best scones, though."}
{"text":"Great breads. Beautiful breads. 
Delicious sandwiches. 
Super dense quiche - my all time favorite - smooth, creamy, divine. 
Fabulous latte!
Awesome local bakery. Neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"all i have to say is veggie bahn mi sandwich. omg. a couple of months ago i would buy one every day while studying for a big exam. lived in cleveland for 5 years and only found this at the end before i moved away. one of the best sandwiches i ever had."}
{"text":"An ultimate Cleveland heights staple. Unbelievable breads! I get them fresh every week!
and ALL pastries are delicious and authentic. I come here every time I pass it, it's irresistible! Great strong coffee too, to compliment the pastry you order!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype?
Most definitely.

If you are \"in the know\", you will have been to On The Rise. If not, well, you need to get moving. I've been there twice in 3 days. All I can say is.... wait, I have a piece of bread in my mouth....

This bakery has been around for over a decade. I had no idea. It's nestled in a tiny strip of stores along a really residential stretch of Fairmount. If you blink you will miss it. And miss it, I did...for years.

That ended the other day when I finally stopped in, after having to look it up on my GPS. On The Rise reminds me of bagel places in NYC. You walk in and it's bare bones. There are a few unassuming tables and chairs in front and racks of bread and goodies behind the counter. They deal in more bread than pastries. So far, I have tried the baguette, rustic Italian, multi-grain, rosemary focaccia and wheat breads. Also tried the chocolate, plain and almond croissants and \"Jennifer\" cookie. Did I mention that I've only been here twice?!  OK, so I didn't buy all that... they graciously have a lot of samples out to try. Everything I tried was perfection. The crust is thick and chewy and the insides melt in your mouth. I wouldn't change a thing. The breads have a freshness that you just don't find often. It's the texture. The center is so moist, it feels cold.

There are certain local establishments that carry On The Rise breads. Murray Hill Market for one. Fresh bread is delivered daily except Mondays. That ridiculously good bread they serve at The Greenhouse Tavern? That's the Rustic Italian. For the experience alone, however, you have to stop in the main joint. You just must..."}
{"text":"We have been to on the rise Bakery two times so far this morning being our second. We travel from Willoughby so it's at least a good 35-40 minute drive. The first time I had called first and I needed traditional French baguettes. To my surprise the nice lady on the phone said I could reserve my bread so it would not sell out on me. I thought this was a nice gesture and policy. The first time we ordered two baguettes and 3 croissants(two chocolate/one ham and cheese) as well as a small mozzarella and tomato focaccia Todays order was two French baguettes 3 croissants a cinnamon raison loaf a large tomato and mozzarella focaccia bread and a chocolate chip cookie. We have had nothing but amazing food here with the focaccia being our favorite.  It's worth a nice Sunday morning drive from Willoughby with the family to go grab some fresh baked bread. The only thing that I did not like was on our first visit we felt very very rushed to place a order as they were busy and we being first timers needed to see what was available to purchase. It also can be kind of hard to read the writing next to the loafs so I'm not really sure yet what all they sell. But a strong 5 star rating for the quality we have received.  Again its really a great quality to be able to place your bread order to guarantee they make yours so it does not run out. They ask for your name and phone number and the bag it up in a nice brown bag with handles"}
{"text":"This is my number one. My baby. My everything. So very happy I stumbled upon this spot after kind of getting bored of Phoenix and Rising Star which have become ritualistic study spots. I originally ventured here to try the Jennifer cookie which ended up being AH-mazing, but is now just one reason why On the Rise is a treasure. From fresh french baguettes, challah, and sourdough to tarts, lemon bars and cookies this spot is THE spot for baked goods. Everything I've had here is lovely and my favs thus far have been the Jennifer cookie and the lemon blueberry tart. I have yet to try the lemon bars that I've been oogling for a while now, but I'm sure they won't disappoint. The true highlight beyond their baked treats are the sandwiches which are usually served till they run out. Happens often. You've been warned. Make sure to get the pulled pork Bahn Mi (they do roast beef too for no pork folks and tofu for vegetarians). They officially stop accepting orders at 3:00pm on regular schmegular days (weekdays). I've made it a habit to come get some work done here with coffee and a cookie and I usually order a sammy to go around 2:57pm. Effective timing. One thing I don't see many people mention is that they also serve a really delicious coffee from one of my favorite California beaneries called Equator. 3rd/4th wave level stuff folks. They sell the beans by the bag too! If you're interested try the Tigerwalk espresso. Def mah fave. Lastly the owner is seriously super cool."}
{"text":"Friendly service. GREAT products. Only wish the restaurant was a bit bigger. When the lines get long the place becomes overpacked. Overall: really enjoyed the experience. GO LOCAL FOODS"}
{"text":"Great bakery.  Everything is good.  Always.  Usually very crowded, particularly in the morning.  Service is not always the friendliest, but it's not bad enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"This place is really great! It reminds me of the European cafes I miss so much! Highly recommend the ham and cheese croissant; its so tasty, we ended up buying some to go for later! Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Oh my GAWD, this place is worth the trip. A French friend of ours stocks their baguettes in her freezer. \"This place beats many bakeries in France,\" is her often-used quote.

The smells, tastes, and atmosphere are wonderful. Walk in, and I dare you to easily pick items off their bakery cart or \"bread wall.\" Not an easy feat!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Cleveland a few months ago, I have been impressed with the amount of great bakeries just in Cleveland Heights- The Stone Oven, Luna, and Zoss have all been terrific on multiple occasions. Recently, I tried out On the Rise, after a lot of hype from various individuals. Over all, I was extremely disappointed. First, I arrive around 12:45 and was informed that they were no longer serving lunch. The girl at the counter seemed to say it with glee, too. Really? No lunch early in the afternoon on a Saturday? Since sandwiches were not an option, I ended up just getting a scone, which was definitely on the dry side with much of the flavor lacking. 

The service also was abysmal; the two girls were not necessarily entirely rude, but could hardly be defined as friendly. Welcoming service seems like it should be a critical element in the industry, so I'll admit that an unfriendly encounter will often leave a negative taste in my mouth. Parking is also a problem here. The only real option is street parking, which can be really difficult to find depending on the day/time you are stopping by. There also is not much seating area, so it's more of a grab-n-go type of bakery. Personally, I don't have a problem with that, but be prepared if you are planning to drop by with a friend.

I love Cleveland Heights and the many unique businesses and cafes/restaurants that make up the community. Unfortunately, On the Rise was the first negative experience I've had in the city, probably indicating that it will be a long time before I venture to give it another try."}
{"text":"Their croissant is the only one that I consider as \"croissant\" in Cleveland. Since I've lived in many countries including France, I have a serious trouble finding a croissant in this town.  I see that croissants from cafes and bakeries in Cleveland are definitely overprived around $2, although they are usually poor quality. I tried out Luna's pastries and they are ridiculously overpriced for their okay quality. ($2.25). On the Rise is my favorite bakery in this area. And of course their baquettes are the best too. They are no other bakeries that are even close in this town. My only wish is that they would bake more than once during a day. According to the staff, most of their breads and pastries are baked only once in the morning so they run out fast by noon."}
{"text":"On the rise is not a new comer to the area but very easy to miss if your not from here. You have to look for it. They do enough in house business not to advertise. I found out about it simply by driving by one day. 
Located on Fairmount just east of Taylor st. Great little morning spot or lunchtime for a quick brownie, cookie, lemon square or a delicious pb and j. 
Ive had good and bad service here so be patient. Parking is tough any time of day. Be sure to bring enough change because they don't cut you slack if your a penny short .
I must add a comment about these delicious Jennifer Cookies. They are chocolate chip oatmeal, pecan cookies that melt in your mouth. I had to buy two more after having tried just one. Delicious coffee comes in a couple different sizes. Service with a smile. Nice and clean, brightly decorated. Very Window-y and plenty of seating for everyone. Parking is a bit tricky but try to a spot in the street. Great Saturday morning meet up spot! 2 pastries and 2 coffees under 10 bucks. I'm sold!"}
{"text":"Best bread shop in town, better than Blackbird on the West Side. Their bread is perfectly crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside, and super cheap. My husband and I stop by and get their French epi, stuffed fougasse, and rosemary focaccia all the time. Their baked goods are also delicious, and when I want a sugar splurge, I go for their fresh baked cookies or sticky buns. For lunch, try their Bahn Mi.... one of the best in town, even better than any of the ones in the actual Vietnamese restaurants. Don't be intimidated if you see a line out the door. They are well staffed, and it moves quick!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Decor is fantastic with an industrial rustic vibe, service is wonderful and quick, and the bakery options are plentiful. I tried multiple things, including the banh mi sandwich and the lemon blueberry tart. The banh mi was great, but they wrapped it in a thin sheet of wax paper and the pickled veggies in my sandwich were pretty juicy, so the wax paper didn't hold up too well. That being said, the baguette, meat, and the pickled veggies tasted great and the sandwich is sizable for $9. The lemon blueberry tart here is special. I've tried tarts at a lot of places in a lot of cities and this has to be one of the best lemon blueberry tarts I've had. Blueberries were fresh, juicy, and ripe; just enough tart to the lemon cream, and the crust was perfectly crumbly and light. I'll definitely be back for another tart! 

The one only slight downside is the parking, but I parked in a nearby neighborhood and it wasn't a big issue."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is darling! It's Coffee,
Muffins, soups and sandwiches are great! The service is friendly and fast. It's a great place to pick up something quick or find a little spot on the long  family sized table or on a seat by the window. They also have whole loaves of bread for sale which are fabulous.

The parking can be a bit tight because it's all metered up in the front or there is sub in the back. But the street is busy and it can get congested quickly."}
{"text":"I am not normally a bread person. That's how good this bread is! It's so hearty and fresh- you can just tell it is made with quality ingredients. I went there today craving a sandwich with buratta cheese and apple jelly but was told that that particular sandwich was seasonal. Oh well-I tried two others and was satisfied with both. The tofu Bahn mi was excellent, as was the other sand which i got with ramp pesto. Other favorites include olive ciabatta bread and chocolate chip cookies. The interior is rustic and unpretentious. I hear they are expanding their seating area but for now it consists of only a few tables. I would go every day if I could!"}
{"text":"I love On the Rise! I come to Cleveland with my family twice a year and we ALWAYS make sure to stop here at least once. On my most recent trip, I tried a ham and cheese croissant and a sticky bun. Everything is good here. I ordered a Mocha Latte. It was late-morning on a Friday, and this place was crowded. When we placed our order, they let us know that the drinks would be a little while, because there were a lot of people in front of us, and only one woman making the drinks. We were in no rush, and were fine waiting. We enjoyed two different free samples while we waited, loved both the breads we tried!

When we sat down to wait, we noticed two older women waiting for their drinks. They were making it known to the entire place that they were VERY aggravated that they didn't get their drinks immediately. The woman making the drinks handled their very rude behavior in a professional manner. She let them know that this was NOT a Starbucks and that drinks were made with care. She was nothing but nice and respectful to these two customers. One of the women called her an a**hole. I was beyond blown away by these women and their rude and completely uncalled-for behavior. I hope they see this and know that this absolutely is NOT an acceptable way to act or treat ANYONE, but especially someone in the service industry!

I'd love to come for lunch and try the Bahn Mi. Everything here is tasty. The service is great. There's no reason to be mean. If you're going to be rude, go to Starbucks!!!"}
{"text":"The Miller's Beef sandwich may be among my favorite (non-burger and non-Slyman's) sandwiches in Cleveland, owing in no small part to the quality of bread, which adds significant taste and texture to the sandwich instead of serving as simply a neutral-tasting handle for the meat inside.  On top of that, the garlic-butter mayo, which is supplied in relatively generous proportions, really ties together well with the soft interior of the bread and dressed greens.  Ironically, the roasted beef may be the least impressive part of the sandwich, though it certainly played its role.

The Raisin Pecan Levain bread was very good and, despite all the initial pieces torn off, held on very well the next morning after some quick warming in the oven.  The Brownie was relatively disappointing (key word: \"relatively\").  While it retained a very moist interior, it could have probably used a deeper chocolate flavor."}
{"text":"Great food, but poor, unfriendly, rude service. We love the cookies, lemon bars, sandwiches."}
{"text":"Hey guys. first review!

Great freshly baked goods of all different kinds of variety! Baguette, Focaccia, Multigrain, Croissants and various other pastries. Randomly enough, their coffee is some of the best I've tasted since I moved to Cleveland in the fall of 2013, although Phoenix Coffee is quite good too.

I want to talk about their lunch items, and specifically their Bahn Mi. I have tried almost every sandwich they have on their lunch menu and all of them are good but some are better than others. The ham and cheese and the beef \"dip\" sandwich are particularly tasty.

My girlfriend and I met in Houston a few years ago and immediately got hooked on the Vietnamese sandwich food scene over there. Always served with Vietnamese style barbecued meat (usually beef, chicken, tofu, or pork) with an assortment of pickled veggies on top, Bahn Mi quickly became one of my favorite things to eat. Once I discovered the Bahn Mi at On the Rise I found a target for my cravings. Their Bahn Mi, while not necessarily traditional, are filled with either pulled pork or tofu, topped with pickled veggies, spread with a garlicky mayo spread, and served on fresh baguette from the back of their kitchen. CRAZY GOOD TASTING!

Please do stop by this place, you realize the kind of special attention they give to their food once you taste it."}
{"text":"What a cool place (finally) in the area!  This place is serious about making truly good artisan breads and the store fits in its location perfectly.  Everything I got there - croissant, sticky bun, and red pepper rosemary foccacia (or something like that)  - was all so delectably delishus and surprisingly friendly to my wallet!  Really really reasonable. There's always a crowd here too, so you know it's a good place.

The only thing I wish this place had was nicer and more seating.  It's more of a place to go and just pick up your bread than buy a croissant or sticky bun and coffee with a friend to sit and chat or read or hangout.

yay, i'm a fan."}
{"text":"Amazing croissants, arguably the best in the city. You can tell this place hand makes everything from scratch with quality ingredients, no premade frozen thaw and bake junk here.  I mentioned the croissants first because they are just so perfect but really everything they make is great. One thing to keep in mind is that because they make everything from scratch, when they sell out of something for the day, they are out out so don't expect the most popular items to be available near the closing time."}
{"text":"If I go to Heaven it will look and be like On the Rise. World class bakery. So worth the stop. Tea Bread is amazing, but really everything is amazing!"}
{"text":"It's all about the Jennifer Cookies. 

Unlike traditional chocolate chip cookies, these cookies feature chocolate shavings and crushed pecans, so that every single bite of these delightful cookies is full of chocolatey peacany goodness. 

I brought these to a dinner party and everyone could not get enough and loved 'em. If you're in Cleveland Heights, or even close to On the Rise, you should stop by and give the Jennifer Cookies a try...you won't regret your decision."}
{"text":"Order bread, they but the bread on the counter by the register not bagged.  I thought that was strange especially when I watch people place their money and other items on this counter."}
{"text":"Literally the best croissants I've ever had in my life. I have not had one that can compare. This was the only thing I requested as a \"gift\" from my husband on our wedding day. I had them for breakfast that morning. That's how much these croissants mean to me. I only wish I were closer!"}
{"text":"We were here for a swim meet and needed a quick bite to eat. Nice artisan bakery shop. Had the roast beef sandwich the bread was very good and the beef was medium rare and tender."}
{"text":"The french baguette is classic - chewy, holey, with a thick, chewy crust.

On Sundays, they only sell the bread and cookies - no sammies! Be. disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for so long.  Bit they're not open in the evenings.  Finally was able to stop by for lunch and it lived up to my ridiculous expectations.  The ham gruyere sandwich was delicious and though half of it with a soup or salad would be great lunch I could not stop eating the sandwich.  Its 7$ and the myriad of textures and flavors is delightful.  I also bought challah bread around 4$ and cinnamon raisin bread about 4.75$ and a jenny cookie 1.75$ (oats, choc chip and pecan).  I would come back for a baguette and regular bread routinely. This a cleveland gem."}
{"text":"Bread and pastries are great. Customer service not so much. Went with my 4 year old son for a snack break during our walk around the neighborhood. Stopped during the lunch rush. There was a line to the door when I came in and only one person taking orders and manning the register. The other employees were just standing there chatting, ignoring the line of customers. Woman who served me was not warm or friendly to me like she was to the other customers (maybe I wasn't their typical clientele? I wasn't old, rich, or dressed up. I was in workout clothes with a toddler. I had tattoos just like all the employees). I am not expecting a conversation by any stretch of the imagination, but to at least be treated like a person; a person paying for your products. 

Also I would like to suggest maybe a plate for people who are dinning in, even for bakery items. Seems very wasteful to give two items in two different bags that are going to be throw out in store."}
{"text":"My husband and I look forward to our weekend trips to on the rise. I love that we have this cozy and delicious spot in our hood.

Breakfast or lunch, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best bakery I've ever been to and I'm so lucky I have them in my backyard. everything is fresh, everything is delicious, and the atmosphere is just as wonderful as the food. It has a small town, family-owned feel to it, and I refuse to get my breads and pastries from anywhere else. Their croissants are my absolute favorite ever!"}
{"text":"This place is unreasonably good. Flawless, even. Their breads are spectacular; the Jennifer cookie is as good as they say (though in comparison I found their plain old chocolate chip cookie meh). The BLT is everything you want in a BLT; the Miller's beef sandwich with pickled pineapple is totally glorious. This is my favorite place in the east burbs for lunch, period."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! 
I love to come in and grab some sweet treats and some bread for the week. 
I love the renovations that you guys have done.
The service is always awesome, the place is always packed.
The pecan cinnamon rolls are my favorite. I've tried to make them at home and haven't been able to. Lol!

I do however wish there were more parking options. Other than that, this place is fantastic. 
Good hearty home baked bread that is perfect with anything.
Pastries that will leave you begging for more."}
{"text":"Bread is amazing! So fresh, unlike anything else you can get in America. They had a nice vegan tomato faro stew that I got and I also got the banh mi Vietnamese sandwich. I got it just with pickled vegetables since I don't like tofu, and it was surprisingly very good! Would def get it again. Very unique sandwich that's not offered most places."}
{"text":"Been here a few times to pick up pastries.  It's a tiny shop but it's so delicious! Everything I've had is fantastic and the workers here are very friendly.  It's a nice little shop if you want to sit and read for a bit too or catch up with a friend.  This past time I tried the Jennifer cookie for the first time. O.M.G. To die for.  Definitely stop by and try this place for some delicious pastries, get there early because they tend to run out of stuff by the end of the day!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times, and finally decided one random weekend to stop by and check it out. I'm so glad I made the stop! This place is a cute little shop stuck in between other random shops in a predominantly residential area. You have to find street parking, which I usually abhor doing...but this place is worth the annoyance! Everything is freshly made, and you can actually see people at work as soon as you step through the doors. I've tried the ham and Gruyere cheese sandwich, which is my favorite! The bread is crispy and they use fresh ham and cheese, with the perfect proportion of meat and cheese for a sandwich. I normally dislike places that absurdly over-stuff their sandwiches to the point you can't even bite down on it, or even try to fit it in your mouth. I've also had their Miller's beef sandwich, which was nice and refreshing. The place in general is great for a fast bite, or if you want to take out some sandwiches and eat outside. I'm definitely coming back to this place for lunch again!"}
{"text":"This is truly one of Cleveland's gems. The epi bread is second to none. They work tirelessly to make an ungodly amount of bread.  Thank you to everyone who has a role in the production of this magnificent bread."}
{"text":"Your Saturday mornings can get tastier if you start a cult of visiting On the Rise on Fairmount Blvd. The warm bread and pastries are continuously popping from the oven and you won't regret any of your choices. Be ready to have long lines at the busiest hours, but I can guarantee it's worth it. Make sure to check the small street fair being held around On the Rise on Saturday mornings to find some treats."}
{"text":"Every proper neighborhood should have a bakery. If I had my way, it would be a rule. The Heights neighborhood claims a significant one at that. Among the rest, I truly believe that On the Rise stands alone. 

Envision this: an early morning loaf baking from inside the Fairmount Boulevard kitchen. The bread ovens-- so warm-- steaming the windows and shrouding the mystery of within from passersby. And then there's the sweet smells of freshly baked bread wafting in the Cleveland Heights air. It's enough to both awaken your senses and melt your heart with desire and envy. Fresh, airy, buttery goodness. To Celiac's living nearby, this would be considered torturous. 

The bakery itself is no frills. The front of the house consists of a couple cafe tables, but for the most part, it's a take-out business. Behind the counter, you can see where all the magic happens as bakers covered in flour work to replenish the stock . Come in for a traditional French baguette, a buttery croissant or infamous sticky bun and take with or sit on one of the benches outside and devour. The daily offerings also include a variety of artisanal breads and loaves along with several pastries to chose from. They also make a homemade granola that's out of this world. As for coffee, they have that covered too. 

A quick tip: A line usually forms on the weekend that stretches outside. This is obviously a sign that this place is locally approved. To be able to live so close is a blessing. I can see a visit to On the Rise becoming a morning tradition."}
{"text":"I go here every week-end it is the best bakery I've ever been to better than I had when I was in France.  they but time into the bread and in their sandwiches they only use the best ingredients possible the staff is friendly and nice and the sticky bun is to die for."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer since their open. Usually, when restaurants expand, quality overall goes down because they can't handle the higher quantity of food. However, On the Rise has only gotten better... it's on the rise! Their chocolate chip cookies, apple tarts, and ham and gruyere sandwiches are to DIE for. Decor is cold but perfect for a modern bakery setting."}
{"text":"The almond croissant I received was completely burnt on the bottom. I'm sure not everything is but I'm not sure why they would serve it. I've heard great things so I will try it again."}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of a friend. I definitely like the location, being a quaint suburban area in Cleveland Heights. I went on a Saturday, and there was a pretty big crowd and a long line for the bread. Finding parking was a bit of a hassle, but fortunately the side street had 3 hour parking.

As far as the food went, I tried the banh mi sandwich. I've only had banh mi at 2 other establishments, but what immediately struck me about this place's banh mi was the fact that the pickled vegetables were very, very sour. I felt the vegetables overpowered the sandwich, and I decided to eat the vegetables first then try the rest of the sandwich. Texture wise, the baguette wasn't bad, but I thought it was just a bit too thick for me. The meat was pretty good but not stand out ish.

Given the long lines and the hype this place gets on Yelp, I'm willing to give it another try in the future and perhaps try their standard fare. But as far as the banh mi goes, I felt it was overall too sour for my tastes and I think I'll have to try something else."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet!  This is that amazing bakery on Fairmount that frequently has a line of people out the door.  They have delicious bread - I particularly like their rosemary foccaccia.  I also really love their apple tarts, croissants, Jennifer cookies, everything!  Ever since we've discovered this last year we've come back multiple times, often when we are off on a road trip and want some bread to munch on for the road.

Their lunch options are a little less exciting to me.  Their Banh mi is probably their best lunch option with the most flavor, but really, this is not a lunch place.   Also tried their ham and gruyere which was, well, ham and cheese."}
{"text":"Michael Symon's restaurants get their bread here. Enough said. Truly as good as a French countryside bakery. How lucky we are to have this in the Cleveland area.

On the Rise bakes bread and pastries the authentic, European Way. Their bread is as good as any French bread I've had in Europe. Baguettes are supreme. And there's nothing quite like the taste of a slice of cinnamon raisin bread still warm from the oven.

On the Rise is in a residential neighborhood, and parking takes planning. Plus, it is a small place, and if you go there for lunch, expect tight quarters. But the food is well worth it.

Once you have tasted bread from On the Rise, you will find it hard to accept anything less."}
{"text":"Won't lie, I'm very let down after stopping by On the Rise. During class I found awesome reviews and delicious lunch photos for this place. I was excited to grab lunch and study in their limited seating area after class. Unfortunately, it was 3pm and apparently they stop selling lunch at 1:30pm. Downfall number one... 

I took a brownie to go regardless, just to try the bakery part of this place. This experience was downfall number two... It was dry! Probably from being out in the open on the display rack. Sitting baked goods out in the open really is not working well. Plus it is kind of gross... Imagine the bugs and the heavy breathing of patrons!"}
{"text":"We love this bakery... 1 because we can walk there and not feel as bad about the delicious calories we are about to eat. And 2 we haven't had a bad item from them. Prices are reasonable and even with a line out the door, the wait is never long. From breads to pastry's and sandwiches, i have done the homework. Parking can be a pain as its all street parking so if you go on a Saturday best bet is usually a side street . Enjoy, we do!"}
{"text":"When I am in the neighborhood, I stop in for a treat.  Finding a place to park can be a challenge, but the neighborhood is lovely, so I park wherever a space is available and walk.

Each time I stop in, I choose a different bread;  today's pick is a gorgeous French baguette (all the loaves look great, but the two of us can handle just one at a time).  Chose to indulge in a Jennifer cookie, and enjoyed half of it with a cup of coffee (the cookies are large);  the other half will make a nice evening snack with some hot tea.  

Glad/sad that I don't live in this neighborhood;  would love to have these goodies nearby, but would be eating too many goodies if they were too accessible. Two yums up for On The Rise."}
{"text":"Good coffee and breads! They said they will start breakfast sandwiches soon. The almond croissant was divine."}
{"text":"My favorite place on the east side! 

I pretty much only get the prosciutto & arugula sandwich with honey butter. It's amazing! But in general, all the sandwiches are the best sandwiches. 

All their pastries are also awesome. Haven't had a bad or even just ok item yet. It's all good. Really love the lemon drop cookies in a bag, though."}
{"text":"Super great bread, cookies, and sandwiches. I had a ham sandwich and my bf had the prosciutto and arugula. Both were really great. Not too fussy and the bread is to die for. He also had a cup of coffee which was nothing special, but worked out just fine. Tried the chocolate chip cookie. It was quite crisp around the edges and then super soft and moist in the center. Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's so good, it's now a part of my routine.

Apparently I'm not the only one hooked on this gem of a bakery. Every time I'm there I run into friends and colleagues.

On The Rise is a quaint operation that produces amazing stuff. Their scones are fantastic. Try their Jennifer or Hermit cookies! They're on part with Momofuku's Compost Cookies. Chocolate croisants, tarts and of course a great selection of the non-sweet variety of breads. Their badguettes are great. They serve a wonderful fair trade coffee too!

What makes On The Rise different than the typical pastry case at a coffee shop is the quality. Everything tastes real / home made. It's hard to quantify this but when you taste it you'll agree. They don't seem to take shortcuts and the proof is in their work.

Check them out but don't wait too long. They often run out of several items by 11, which I suppose is annoying but it kind of adds to their charm and validates my theory about how everything they make is painstaking prepared.

Current Favorites: Rustic Apple Tart, Chocolate Croisant."}
{"text":"This place is what the phrase \"eye candy\" refers to! When you walk in, you are greeted with a beautifully bare-bones rustic bakery vibe, in which you can see straight back into the kitchen area. All the breads and baked goodies are out on display for viewing pleasure...oh and don't even get me started on the aroma! Instant salivation upon walking in. 

Desserts:
- Apple tart: This crust is buttery, crispy, and all around crumbly goodness. With a center of warm sweet apples, this dessert cannot steer you wrong!
- Apricot croissant: This is where On the Rise truly shines. I've NEVER had a better croissant! It was just the right amount of flakiness to feel light and airy without completely falling apart. It was buttery and the apricot center was delicious. Definitely a must try!
- Raspberry square: This one was kind of a dud. The top was too crumbly and the raspberry tasted like store bought jam. This one was a miss unfortunately. 

Breads:
- Sourdough: The sourdough is great! Not too dense and just the right size to last a few days, even if shared. Yummy!
- Olive loaf: I wish this loaf wasn't so flat! It makes it difficult to use the slices for sandwiches. I resorted to open faced sammies, which were still delicious, I just wish that they weren't so thin! But the olive to bread ratio is just perfect and the price is comparable if not better than the olive loaf at Whole Foods! 

*Tip: Come early! This place gets packed very early in the morning on the weekends and there is very limited seating."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying: I REALLY wanted to love this place.

First, there's no parking, except on the street.  It's comical watching people try to parallel park in front of this place (in front of the fire hydrant, too.)  

Second, know this is more of a \"grab and go' place: you point to what you want, pay, and leave.  There's very little dine-in space.

Third:  The food...  We ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (they were out).  So we ordered the ham and Gruyère sandwich and the roast beef sandwich, an apricot pecan square for the child, coffee, and a baguette.
The apricot pecan square was tasty.  The coffee was good.

We waited over twenty minutes...finally, the husband inquired about our order.  They lost it.  We waited ten more minutes, got our sandwiches and left.  The staff was nice but seemed disorganized.
We got home...and that's where the real disappointment began.  The sandwiches were COLD...really?  A cold ham and cheese and a cold roast beef?  Big turn-off for me.
I thought they would be hot sandwiches; but, to be fair, it was not specified.  
The ham was fatty, but the cheese on it was very good, as was the bread.  The roast beef, on the other hand, was topped with radishes, arugula and some sort of sauce, and so much cracked black pepper that I coughed.  In my opinion, these would be MUCH better if served hot (personal preference.)

The baguette was good, but so is the one you can buy at Panera.
All in all, this place did not live up to the hype for me."}
{"text":"Great place for artisanal bread and natural tea or lemonade.
I recommend The Chicken sandwich, that comes with a delicious homemade sauce."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Perfect croissants. If it's a sunny day, sit outside and met the neighbors. Also, great pies for holidays, but be sure to order ahead."}
{"text":"Sticky Buns . All I need to say. Everything there is super fresh and good. Friendly staff letting you know if something you would like might be a little burnt so that you don't have the surprise."}
{"text":"Great coffee, not super sweet and the espresso has a nice smooth tone (not too bitter). I appreciate the cozy atmosphere, although it is small and can be loud with more people inside. Was able to eat and do minor work, but not a place I'd study for a big test. It's very family friendly and Baristas are super sweet!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place for over 12 years now   

Like the great local bakeries in Europe ... On the Rise offers a superior product  bakery product with a local neighborhood feel and friendly staff.  They have great tables to sit outside in the warmer part of the year.

The owner Adam started out small focusing on limited number of pastries (like his sticky bun w or w/o nuts, cookies, brownies, scones) along w artisan breads coffee and tea.   

Now they greatly expanded product offerings, added bakers, serve local gourmet restaurants, & serve lunch.  This year there expanding to give elbow room to more customers inside when the crowd can't sit at the outside tables and benches.

Stop in early as some of the popular items (croissants) sell out.  Stop in for Brian's creative and expanding lunch offerings - especially with more indoor seating with the new expansion.  Stop in at end of day for that special bread to go with dinner, or just after your long bike ride or run for that cookie, epi, baguette, or multigrain treat."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Almond Croissant
Pear Frangipane Tart
Bostock
Apricot Croissant
Sticky Bun with Nuts
Oatmeal Raisin Cookie
Jennifer Cookie - Chocolate Chips, Toasted Pecans, Pulverized Oats, Shaved Chocolate

Located on Fairmount Boulevard and shockingly well attended considering an eight o'clock arrival on Tuesday, On The Rise Artisan Breads has quickly made a name for itself as one of Northeast Ohio's go-to spots for Baked Goods, Soups and Sandwiches, the team's passion for local products and skilled craftsmanship highly evident in each of their creations.

Technically a part of Cleveland Heights, the wealthy suburb allowing for prices necessary to make products the right way, On The Rise features a variety of seating options sprawling left and front of the open kitchen and glass cases, the list of temptations numbering about twenty during this visit and said to change frequently throughout the week as well as the season.

Busy but pleasant in service, Coffee service near a hallway en route to the back and bathrooms, it was with seven items bagged or plated that seating was secured for pictures and some tasting, a child and his father enjoying story time over Almond Croissants to the right as the youngster played with toys kept in the restaurant, first bites of that same pastry sending golden shards skyward as layers of lamination gave way to pure nut filling.

Finding the Apricot Jam Croissant every bit as compelling as the more tradition Almond version, no sog at all found amidst the Butter-rich core, Bostock unfortunately came across far drier than those tasted overseas or at Tartine in San Francisco - the course immediately back on track as the Sticky Bun unraveled in elegantly caramelized ribbons beneath Cinnamon Roasted Walnuts.

Unable to resist a good Cookie, the Oatmeal Raisin sweeter than many but still excellent with a center as soft as a bowl full of cooked Oats, the signature \"Jennifer Cookie\" is perhaps even more compelling as Chocolate Chips and Pecans dial up the toothsome circle's texture, a Pear Frangipane Tart rounding out the morning with more than half of the delicious Almond base and soft Fruit proving just as tasty several hours later."}
{"text":"Amazing! We had a baguette, a brownie, and a Jennifer cookie.  The skill that it takes to pull this off is noteworthy.  Sorry I have no pictures. I ate the evidence."}
{"text":"Very cute bakery with fresh bread and pastries. I usually get a mocha (sweetened) and it's very good. Good customer service. The only thing is it does take a bit to make everything but besides that it's very nice."}
{"text":"This is a cute little bakery. We parked up the street in the neighborhood and walked over. We could smell the bread all the way at the car.
We stopped in for a few croissants. They were a little pricey but way better than anything you get at Starbucks. The place is small and seating is limited, so I imagine it can get pretty crowded on the weekends. Overall, a good place with a lot to offer in the area of bread and pastries. I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but still thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't like spiking my insulin so I avoid bread and white rice most of the time. I try to get top-of-the-line bread when I do indulge. I knew I had to drive to On the Rise after I read all of the glowing Yelp reviews. The bread was excellent and it lived up to the Yelp hype. Blackbird Baking Company vs On the Rise is the Clash of the Titans."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Breads, pastries all top notch. Try everything. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday about hour prior to closing. People were outside enjoying a meal or bread and the inside was fairly quite.  On the rise uses a proofing rack to display many of their baked goods, all of which looked amazing. 
My mother and I purchased three loaves of bread , two desserts and one seeded flat loaf. All of which were amazing ! Very tasty , great texture and bite. 
The reason I give two stars ? Because the clerk behind the counter was a grumpy witch! She was rude, condescending to my myself and mother. She could barely be bothered to toss our bread in a paper bag, and by the way thanks for stacking my $6 tart and blondie bar in the same tiny container they really lent a great flavor to each other. We enquired as to larger orders for our family owned east side restaurant and when we mentioned where it was located and if it there was a delivery option grumpy replied \" ummmmm no , never\"in her hipster best tone. 
Here is the run down - want great bread and willing to deal with asshole- ery? Then stop in.
Want great bread and actually want good service ? Because you know , you're paying for it , find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick breakfast while visiting a friend. 

My husband has a sticky bun, I had the almond croissant and we shared the bacon/cheese quiche! The baked goods were great and the quiche was amazing!!!! So good and moist!"}
{"text":"Welcome to French-inspired bakery where the croissants and pains aux raisins feel like a slice of childhood. Their feuilletage (flaky pastry in croissants and sticky buns) is out of this world! The diversity of breads (épi, baguettes à l'ancienne, fougasses aux olives) is wide and each of them is a testimony to the baker's kindness with the rising process--perfect caramelized crustiness and not overly soft or dense crumb.
The store's atmosphere is warm and welcoming to the not-so-awake gourmet. There is a large table shared by strangers brought together by wholesome baked goods and delicious coffee and tea, which often leads to interesting conversations. 
Delightful little crumbsnatching connoisseurs  at play gather around a few books and toys left there just so. 
This place is a source of simple fun, deliciousness and joy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bakery in the Cleveland area - and that's high praise considering Zoss and Luna are nearby. Having lived in Europe for six years I learned to appreciate good bread, and this is the best around. The sandwiches are amazing. My personal favorites are the ham and gruyere and bahn mi. My favorite breads are the French epi, the Pullman loaf, the Honey Oat, the Cherry Chocolate and the Cinnamon Raisin. The sourdough is my go-to for stuffing at Thanksgiving. My sister could not stop eating it last year and looked forward to it this year. Their croissants are perfect - flaky with the best shatter, whether they are plain, chocolate, almond or apricot. The sticky buns are amazing - both with and without nuts. And there is nothing better in life than a warm Jennifer cookie fresh out of their oven. You really can't go wrong with anything here. The lack of parking is a bummer, so I try to go at off hours and avoid Saturdays altogether if I can."}
{"text":"On The Rise knocks it out of the park, every time! 

By focusing on what they do best - and what we all came here for! - which is simple breads and pastries executed beautifully with great, fresh ingredients, On The Rise wins my vote for Best Bakery on the East Side, if not the whole City.

Other reviewers have noted the limited seating space and limited hours of operation: On The Rise isn't really trying to be a cafe. They are only trying to be a wonderful bakery, and that they are!

Everything I have tried here has just knocked my socks off! The Sticky Buns are a favorite, as is the Bacon Gruyere Loaf, Sourdough Bread, and all of the Croissants! 

I have found their prices to be more than reasonable and the waitstaff to be reliably pleasant on my numerous visits. 

Come to On The Rise. Perhaps don't plan on languishing here as you might in a coffee shop. Come, grab your heart's-content of baked goods and head out for a walk around one of the Shaker Lakes or take their treasures home to your family. It's a truly perfect bakery experience."}
{"text":"This is a true baker's bakery.  Cookies are often presented warm and melty.  All of the breads have a real tooth to them--golden crispy exteriors, chewy delicious interiors.  No bubble gum bread on this premises!  For those of you who know the Zingerman's Bake Shop empire, On the Rise is of a similar ilk, with a more low key local vibe."}
{"text":"Great bread, good coffee, excellent pastries.  I live nearby and frequent On the Rise for many of my bread needs, as they easily have the best bread on the east side of town.  If interested in a loaf of bread, this is the place to shop.

While their food is great, I have a few issues with the establishment.  The available eating space inside is quite limited, don't plan on eating in if you go during a busy time.  From my experience service has been mixed.  Prices are not modest.  Parking situation is not optimal.  The establishment does not have a bread slicer, nor means of slicing.  While they have a strong commitment to serving and preserving their fresh bread, I have an even stronger commitment to eat sandwiches made with sliced bread.  While slicing may have a small effect on shelf-life and taste, it's a service that any bakery should offer.  My hulking, jagged slices I end up cutting at home really kill the experience.

Excellent if on the east side, but I'll continue to buy most of my bread from the west side market."}
{"text":"I am incredibly spoiled person. For 5 years I lived within 5 blocks of On the Rise. During those years many days were filled with rosemary foccacia bread, sticky buns (omg, sticky buns!!), and baguettes. The pastry is always incredibly fresh, the crust is perfect, and it's near impossible to just pass this store without purchasing something- the smell is so incredibly alluring!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years, every chance we get, though we don't live in the area. Good people, simple decor, fantastic offerings. Don't miss the pecan rolls. Just love how in the warmer months, neighbors walk there on a Saturday morning with their dogs to get a cup of coffee and a pastry.....just a charming and wonderful place."}
