{"text":"My family frequents Rosita's and I can see why it's been a Tempe staple for so many years.  The chips and salsa are excellent and worth the trip alone.  I always get a black bean burrito enchilada style and it is the best black bean burrito in town.  The servers are really attentive and friendly as well.  I notice that many people seem to think it's overpriced, but I don't agree.  You can get a cheese crisp at happy hour (which is all day Sat/Sun) for $2.50.  My burrito on the lunch menu is around $6, less than most other similar places.  I do agree that the bathrooms are not the best, but I don't pass up good places simply because of the bathroom.  I'd miss many great dives in larger cities if I did that.  Overall, I think you'll be happy with your meal and the service provided at Rosita's."}
{"text":"THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN THE WORLD!!   Been going here for over 30 years and will continue to come here!  This will always be my favorite!!"}
{"text":"This is your normal Mexican restaurant. Although I eat there at least twice a week, I do not think there is anything special about the food. I do love their bean and cheese burrito but that isn't all that hard to make.   The atmosphere is very casual and there are always kids there. If you can enjoy your meal while sitting in a loud place, then Rosita's is for you. I usually get my food to-go.   The service is good as well, but once again it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Used to come here at least weekly, food is ok but they where cool and had good prices on patron and had a good poor, except last night, we always have two drinks with dinner \" we live in the neighborhood and walk home\" and how , first  one was a little short and I noticed  it was some one else working the bar, so we ordered another and when they showed up it was half the size of the first one that was barley 1.5 oz. So we complained very nicely and they didn't do nothing, no refund on the crapy shots, no new shot, nothing. And when I told them I wouldn't be coming back ever again because they didn't fix their problem, they didn't care and kept saying that so annoying word :im sorry\"  Never again, my tab is always over a hundred and now I will not ever go back over 3.00 of Patron and Ill make sure everyone of my customers and friends and family do not support them or places like that , that think its ok to act like you work at wal-mart"}
{"text":"I don't know why there are bad reviews. This place has friendly staff, great chips and salsa, and great food combinations. Its also quite affordable. I come here for lunch and dinner quite frequently. It is a top choice of mine for Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"I genuinely hate places like this; \"this\" being places that lull you in with some back story of the \"MUY AUTENTICO\" food/founder and their story of making wholesome food from old recipes, et cetera, and then you get your meal and realize either the founder was a liar or they just have been serving trash since she died.  I had a combo plate with a tamale, a tostada, and a taco. All tasted like they came straight from the microwave, and the standard beans-rice accompaniment was typical from a box/can in taste. (I got black beans, and they were served in a bowl. They were *just* like you would get from a can, and pretty sure they were floating in the can-water which most people discard).  I guess you can say one thing about this place: It's an equal-opportunity employer. However, that's not a good thing in this case: The college valley-girl type staffs the joint and very loudly gossips in front of customers- Like, welcome to Tempe! As if!  Can't believe they charge more than 3 bucks for a plate for this stuff in good conscience.  Leave it."}
{"text":"This isn't bad if you want cheap and convenient and greasy Mexican food. I live in walking distance and a few friends and I go sometimes. Their happy hour is cheap (dollar off margs and 1/2 price appetizers). The margarita is weak and corn syrupy though. The interior is run down, and that can be charming if a place has out-of-this-world authentic and fresh food, but this is sub-par and have had much better cheap Mexican. The salsa is fresh and delicious, and that's what it mainly has going for it. The chips are usually a bit stale. They douse everything in cheese. The best item I've gotten is the spinach enchiladas, which I recommend if you're hard up for Mexican and end up here. I go if I'm bored and don't want to drive or bike anywhere -- convenience, but I would rather make my own Mexican at home (which is sad that as a Kentucky boy I feel like I can do better). I expect so much more out of Mexican food places in this part of the country and have had mind-blowingly better than this even in Kentucky."}
{"text":"My coworker and I love stopping by the lounge for lunch. The chip guy is great!! Always friendly and greets us every time.  Always right there when we needed more chips or some of the hotter sauce. Great service!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow... can you say bland? Flautas would be much better with seasoning. The Peppi Burger was too small for the bun and had more breading then stuffing in a Thanksgiving Turkey . If you like guacamole from a jar and tasteless food this place is for you."}
{"text":"This last weekend was the first time I had been to Rosita's in over 15 years. Back in undergrad I used to date a girl who worked there. She would bring me different dishes pilfered from the kitchen after each shift. Life was good. Anyway, I can report that nothing on the menu appears to have changed much since then. It is still hearty Sonoran fare. The salsa and red sauce have bite, the chips are warm and the burros are well stuffed. I do, however, have one gripe. My dinner arrived at the table with a most unappetizing helping of pre made soylent green looking goo on top of it. For a $12 entree, they really should have stepped up and rocked the fresh guacamole. Other than that, it is an A-OK place to grab a filling meal."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch when I arrived in Tempe. The menu has a large variety of different Mexican and not so Mexican dishes. I had the carne asada; it was decent. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either."}
{"text":"Checked into a hotel on University yesterday and decided to drive down the street looking for a restaurant. I should have gone to Subway and saved myself about $20. They didn't have any 100% blue agave other than Patron, which I don't drink. The house margarita is Jose Cuervo which is headache city, so I ordered unsweeted ice tea. I was hungry so I ordered the Fajita Trio, consisting of beef, shrimp and chicken. When it arrived I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it, so much food. The beef was tough, the chicken was dry, and the shrimp was passable. The refried beans were runny and the rice wasn't very good. I could go on, but I think you get the picture. The entree was $16.95 and I didn't finish it, nor did I ask for a doggy bag. Rosita's Fine Mexican Food is misnomer. Oh yes, I did have to rush back to the hotel to go to the bathroom. You can figure out why."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and figured I'd give it a try .. Didn't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to ASU . Place smelled dirty right when you came in .. Poor greeting and the place was empty. Came in around 645. Ordered a fajita and an enchilada. The fajitas were ok , they didn't provide any lettuce or cheese, or tomato. The guac was less than desirable and looked like it came out of a bag and the sour cream didn't seem fresh . The fajitas didn't have any sizzle to it upon arriving at the table. The enchilada was ok .. Nothing fancy . The server didn't seem like he even wanted to be there .. This place needs a huge makeover! Better lighting , refresh the menu and update the decor . I found this place on yelp!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why I keep returning to this place, it really isn't great or fancy.  Last night I didn't even like the salsa, and the chips seemed stale.  I had a pork burro, very very very very very salty.  Yikes!  And I a usually the one who uses the salt shaker.  I guess it is convenient to meet a friend, but something has got to give here.  One more shot then I will possibly have to move on.  Oh, and did I mention that they didn't even offer us a refill on the chips?  they gave us an extra salsa but whatcha gonna do with extra salsa?  It was ok, just not great..."}
{"text":"My brother and I were heading to the restaurant next door and decided to try here instead. We won't be back. The half-price bean dip appetizer sounded good, but came out very runny and bland. We added a ton of salsa which only helped a tiny bit. Service was extremely slow. We wanted to send it back but nobody returned to the table until our dinner arrived. I asked for a side of enchilada sauce since there was so little on my plate. Finally something that tastes good! We mixed a little with the bean dip (which the waiter never took back) and it was finally decent tasting! Waters were finally refilled after asking twice and my soft drink was replaced with the wrong flavor. We didn't bother trying after that. Our waiter dropped off the check and didn't care that our food was hardly touched. He was not phased when we declined to-go containers either. The bill had a $2.95 charge for the extra sauce that we thought should have been included. We tipped according to the service provided and left. I think a major overhaul is needed here."}
{"text":"My wife and I were only in Phoenix for a night, and figured we would try some Mexican food  seeing as we had never been in the Southwest before.  Our 1st restaurant down the street never got around to serving us, so we came to Rosalita`s figuring it might have authentic Mexican cuisine.  It was brutal.  The service was atrocious, as one poor guy was working both the bar and the \"lounge\" area which had about 8 tables full.  He was pleasant, but completely overwhelmed.  The food itself tasted as if it had been left out all day and simply reheated.  The chips were stale and the salsa tasted suspiciously like the crappy Ortega stuff you buy in the supermarket.  My shrimp dish was so disastrous that I only ate half of it because I was afraid it might make me sick.  The shrimp were overcooked to the point of turning into rubber, and the sauce was nauseating.  The rice was overcooked and dry, and the green salad of lettuce and carrots was steamed!   This was without a doubt the worst mexican I have ever eaten in my life.  My wife thought her tacos were bland, but much more edible than my shrimp, even though the cheese was not authentic, or tasty at all."}
{"text":"We drove from Tucson to attend our friends 70th Birthday celebration.     The hosts had reserved a private area in the restaurant for their guests.    We were having a good time . There was a friend who brought his guitar and was playing Mexican music for the guests and the Birthday girl   Most of the guests were in their sixties or older. The service was fair ; the food was good... BUT then.. the cake came out, it was a ice cream cake that clearly had not been put in a freezer area as it was a puddle! Just as the cake soup was being served.. the owner of the restaurant came into the room and started yelling at the top of his lungs for everyone to leave. (mind you this was an hour before the party was to end) The host was Terribly embarrassed  in front of her guests . The owner claimed there were intoxicated people that were smoking  cigarettes in the restaurant (which was not true.)   I personally would have taken the host or hostess to the side and explained why I was unhappy rather than come into the room yelling and making a scene! That was completely uncalled for!!   I don't live in Mesa , so I probably won't be retuning to this restaurant but I can say this , the 30 people that attended this party won't return either and after hearing this story told to 10 of their friends each, there goes 300 potential customers out the door.     Nice going boss man. How's that going to work in your favor?"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I have not been terribly impressed the two times I have been there. It is standard mexican sit-down restaurant faire. I would rather go to Guadalupe and get some good street tacos."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa, ok but does not taste homemade and how hard is that?  I order a bean burrito with enchilada sauce on it and asked the waiter if it was vegetarian. The waitress looked unsure but said yes. When the food came, there was a definate meaty taste so I asked her if she could make sure it was veg. She huffed back to the kitchen and returned saying it was. I threw up that night and my friend threw up the next morning but didn't know what to attribute it to.  For some ridiculous reason (probably the location and a margarita craving) we came back a few weeks later. I ordered the same thing and again asked if it was vegetarian. The waiter, Seth was very polite and said he would go check. When he came back, he informed me that their enchilada sauce is NOT vegetarian and apologized.   I won't be back for their bland, uninspired food and rude (except seth)  wait staff."}
{"text":"Love the Queso Chicken Stacked Enchiladas. About five of us go and always order the same thing."}
{"text":"The food is great here; I've been a customer for at least 15 years.  The only drawback is that it is very busy sometimes, and the kitchen can get a little backed up, but usually your food arrives within 10 minutes of ordering. The bathrooms need a major overhaul, but that's the case with most family owned places; they spend the money on staff and quality food. I highly recommend any of their dishes with green chiles. Very, very good."}
{"text":"I went there last night, and both my boyfriend had a bad experience. Let's start with we got the appetizers. Decent Appetizer Platter... minus the fact that it was cold. Margaritas- Okay nothing amazing. Cheese Crisp- Good Flavor, but hard to chew  The service/waitress was kind of rude, and wasn't very attentive even on the aspect of a glass of water.  We just figured we had a bad time and would try it again, that was until 2 am the next morning when he was puking his soul out."}
{"text":"The cheesy spinach white sauce over the chicken enchilada was super delicious! We had great service from Jordan. Restaurant and bathrooms were clean. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Bad food, but lots of it.  If you have a hangover and need grease, this is your place.  Other than that, drive a block and eat at Mucho Gusto down the street--now that is real mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is just a hole in the wall mex. place but I love some of the servers. Especially manny. We typically stick to margaritas and snack food, but we still love it."}
{"text":"This place first of all is way over priced for simple food, service is poor and the food just has no taste, I had the  chicken enchiladas lunch special the only good thing was the size of the enchiladas were decent but the bad is only one side for 10 buck rice or beans all Mexican places come with both...also had a burger but they wanna charge 2.50 for fries that should come in my 11$ dollar plate .. I went in a group of people from work nobody was happy"}
{"text":"What was that freaking smell? Holy crap. Smelled like a dirty diaper wrapped in farts. Permeated the entire restaurant. Sure didn't do much to make the greasy over-priced food any more appetizing, I'll tell you that. Thought maybe it was a one-time thing, but after a quick scan of a couple previous reviews, it seems to be a recurring theme with this place. Yuck."}
{"text":"Pretty average Mexican food.  Went for lunch and had the stacked enchilada plate with chicken.  The chips served before the meal were hot and crispy but the salsa was only fair.  Like mine chunky and this was a bit too watery for me.  The stacked enchiladas were nothing special.  Store bought corn tortillas swimming in green sauce and cheese.  The chicken inside had little flavor and could have been shredded better.  It came as a couple of large chunks of meat.  The beans and rice...well...average once again.  Service was okay as was the cost.  Guess I prefer the little places closer to downtown Phoenix in the 16th-24th street area as they are much more authentic tasting.  This would probably be a good option for families with small kids or older folks looking for more bland Mexican options.  All in all rates a meh.  This is my first usage of the meh word as I didn't feel I understood it until now."}
{"text":"Growing up in Tucson, I often have a craving for Mexican food.  I have tried many places throughout the valley and Rositas is great.  The food is cheap and is consistent.  I typically get the taco/enchilada combo, or a green chile chimi.  The margaritas are also pretty good.  I also always ask for the hot sauce with my chips and salsa.  I can't give it 5 stars because I have had better Mexican food, but this is the best I have had in the Phoenix area so far."}
{"text":"the WORST mexican food ever...no, the worst food ever.  in phoenix for 2 weeks for work from LA. don't bother coming to this restaurant if you're used to living in a city with plentiful delicious mexican food. taco bell has better tasting beans and rice than rosita's.   got the sampler platter which was more like a random mash of sauces with unidentifiable food.   the food was completely BLAND. the salsa, refried beans, tamales, etc were all tasteless. how do you mess up refried beans? the enchiladas were made with what seemed like nacho cheese. even the chips seemed stale.  the only mexican thing about this place was the music. they should import some of the immigrants arizona kicked out and get some people that actually know how to cook, prepare, serve, and host a mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Our server was very attentive and warm-Kudos here. The three \"street tacos\" however, was much less impressive. These bland, luke-warm, crockpot-style shredded beef with onion and cilantro \"tacos\" need a different name other than the universally loved \"street\" tacos depicted at such places like America's Taco Shop off 7th St and Monte Vista.  Note to the Rosita's management - look at the photo of the three street tacos depicted at America's Taco Shop off 7th St and Monte Vista, and either model your version of the street taco after theirs, or call yours something else.   Good luck,  Gloria and Licia, Chandler"}
{"text":"I've had decent experiences at Rosita's in the past. However, went to eat there this weekend and it was truly AWFUL. I ordered the huevos rancheros burrito - there were barely any eggs, and the rest of the burrito consisted of soggy green peppers. My girlfriend ordered a grilled chicken burrito, but could only get through one bite before sending it back. The chicken was pink and rubbery.   Not sure what happened but I wouldn't recommend going here anymore."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I had the arroz con pollo and let me tell you it is definitely the best I've ever had! I also ordered a Bloody Mary and would not order that again, but hey I still drank it so I really can't complain. The service was top notch, Great spot! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, and it's always just as good as the first time I came. A little hole-in-the-wallish, but that's part of it's charm. It's fine, no-frills delicious Mexican, with excellent chips and home-made hot sauce. Just about every item on the menu is a winner."}
{"text":"Visited Rosita's about a month ago. The food was really good and the margaritas were even better.  The service was spot on and very friendly and helpful, the restaurant was clean and cute, and it was an overall good experience.  Rosita's is located in a corner of a strip mall and we visited specifically based on others' reviews and we're glad we didn't. Can't wait to return and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for the quality. I thought it was nasty. Made me gag. Didn't like what I got nor what my husband got. I'm pretty picky though...I don't even like serranos."}
{"text":"Was going to give this place three stars before the bill came for $40 for two people with no alcohol. There is good food here but the rice is awful and so is the carne asada. Stick to chips and guacamole and you will be fine"}
{"text":"When I first saw the outside of this restaurant, I didn't think i had come to the right place, however after trying the food. I feel in love. The food and prices I give 5 stars, the restaurant exterior... I give 2."}
{"text":"I've been to Rosita's quite a few times now and it's consistently pretty good. Salsa gets brought to your table within a minute of being seated and tastes great. The last time I got the fajita quesadilla and their sangria margarita (special of the day) and both were excellent!! Especially the sangria margarita. It really hit the spot during the warm evenings of Tempe.  As far as the staff goes, they're very friendly most of the time. It was only once that my server seemed very annoyed to have to serve tables. I haven't seen them since.  On the downside, I do not recommend the guacamole. It's similar to an avocado paste or puree, which is a bummer. It could be as delicious as everything else and is significantly worse. I had to mix in some salsa to enjoy it at all.  All in all, I think it's a good Mexican place that's unassuming, friendly, and quiet. Nothing too special, but I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good selection, though the food was tasteless.  Service was OK, though a little confused as to who was who and getting the orders straight.  Don't bother, their best days are behind them . . . . ."}
{"text":"Margaritas are good.  Food is average, but always hot and consistent."}
{"text":"I'm going to put the caveat on this review that I am friends with a few of the family members who own Rosita's BUT, I got to know them by coming in to eat.   The fried beef tacos are a fantastic indulgence. But I've discovered that I'm a fan of their carnitas too. Their fish tacos are great - marinated not battered and friend. And, if you're not a bean eater, try to sopa de fidello (noddle soup).   From the bar, consider the house margarita or the matriarch's namesake cocktail - Rosita's Tea.   Check your attitude at the door, sit back, relax, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years with my family. Always had good food and service. My favorite Mexican restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in the East Valley. Tacos, Enchiladas, cheese crisp, menudo, albongidas, pozole, etc. It's the best! I've been coming for over 25 years and I've never been disappointed. The chips and salsa and hot sauce is the best too."}
{"text":"First time at Rositas. Food was fabulous but the service was terrible. We sat down and were immediately given chips and salsa. But then our waitress took forever to come over, and when she did she took our food order at the same time as our drinks. It took what seemed like forever to get our drinks! In fact, we finished a basket of chips without them! Then it seemed like things were smoothing out. Our food came and was amazing so we were feeling good about it. Then the wait for the check was probably 10-15 minutes! And I saw at least 2 other tables in the same position we were. There were only about 6 tables total there. So, food is amazing; service not so much."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this restaurant often. It's a sit down for dinner type place, and the menu is quite extensive. I try something different every time I go, but the fried ice cream is something everyone should try at least once. The person I dine with enjoys the Tamales, but they are a bit pricey for the meal. The daily specials are worth the effort in price, and the lunch menu can't be beat for the time of day.   I do caution people to understand the waiters. It's a touch and go topic, some of the servers are attentive and quick to refill a glass of soda, where-as others can't be found regardless of where you sit. It really just depends on the day and time."}
{"text":"Love the hot sauce and the chicken burritos, love the green chili and red chili.  Service is great especially Armando in the bar."}
{"text":"Solid lunch if you want mexican food. I like the flautas and beef burritos.  Good chips and salsa as well.  Not the best around but definitely not the worst."}
{"text":"Food was alright, but let's be real here...service is everything. The whole reason to dine out is to be served and taken care of. Bald dude with glasses clearly does not know how to offer this. When a table asks for something, you say yes and do it. No one wants to hear your excuses and your flat out no. Give the table what they want. Period."}
{"text":"No. Don't go. We came here as a group of three and each ordered a large meal. I got their Carne Picada which was 13.00 and 2 of their margaritas for 3.00 given that it was margarita Monday. My friends got a margarita too and a taco salad 10.95 and their fiesta bowl 8.95. Personally the food was only ok, I've had better at even Filibertos, definitely other mom and pop shops around. After paying, we sat around as I ordered my second margarita, which, by the way, is not strong at all, because after two I felt nothing. So we were chatting and the waitress comes back and asks us why we had only tipped her 7%. After going over, in detail, who tipped how much, she deliberated that my friend's bill of $11 and tip of $2 was around 12% and that my other friend's bill of $9 and tip of $1.50 was less than 7%. I don't know if she just sucked at math, or something, but I also added on a tip of $4 to a $20 bill of my own. She didn't see it like that and confronted us. First of all, I've eaten out a lot and I have worked as a waitress. You don't go an confront your customers basically blaming them for not paying you what you wanted and asking for more. Then after seeing me pack half of my food away, we left and I forgot my box. I turned around and went back in to grab it. Oh but they had conveniently tossed my box out.   The service, HORRIBLE. I would give it a negative if I could. The food, average. There are better places out there that are cheaper and more authentic. For a mexican place in Arizona, they could have done something that put them above the rest. I should have just gone to Cornish Pasty Co. next door."}
{"text":"We know Mexican food, and Rositas was great. The shredded beef in the chimmis was the best we have had. We liked the guacamole was very creamy and good. Guacamole is like potato salad, there are all kinds, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Desert was more than you could  eat,and good no complaints on the drinks . Staff very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"No matter what you order the salsa and hot sauce aren't good.  The hot sauce is just not good. The salsa tastes like they added vinegar to preserve it. Otherwise, it might be good if they made it fresh and more often. I've lived in Az over 50 years.There are only a few things that a mexican restaurant needs to get right, sauce is one of them."}
{"text":"Consistency is lacking, which for me is a lose! Last week I ordered the 6 pack of shredded beef tacos to go 3 nights in a row. Each night the 6 tacos came in 1 styro box, and were hot, crispy, and very good. They also came with chips, salsa, and hot sauce. I ordered another 6 pack to go last night. The lukewarm to cold tacos were not crispy, and came 3 to a styro box.....waste of a box, and more trash. I asked for NO chips and salsa, but I did not get any hot sauce either! I called, and a manager is supposed to call me. I only called to complain about the lack of hot sauce because it was before I ate the sub par tacos and was extremely disappointed. The chef that made my tacos the week before needs to teach the chef that made them on the night of 10/13/2015 how it is done! I really hate when food I have had before is totally different when ordering the same thing again.               UPDATE: I spoke with the manager the morning of 10/14/2015, and he was very receptive, and said he would speak with the kitchen manager. He also comped me a taco 6 pack which was very nice. Rating changed"}
{"text":"Rosita's has a bad rep. It's a good little place and they retain employees for years, which is a good sign. When you go inside you'll immediately notice a sort of icky, midwestern grossness about it. Expect to see many corpulent men with military hair cuts. They will be squished tightly into their booths shoveling massive quantities of cheese covered food into their mouths. Try not to let that spoil your meal.   Those guys go there for the same reason I do. When you sit down you get a basket of warm chips immediately. Their salsa, which is made with oregano, a much neglected herb in Mexican cuisine, is my favorite. I'm usually in a food coma from eating so many chips before my burrito even arrives. You will not leave hungry. It's good hangover food. If the wait at the over-rated Harlow's diner across the street is too long then try Rosita's instead."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner the other night and ended up wishing we hadn't.  The staff is very friendly and that's probably what keeps this place open. The food is bland at best and way overpriced for a little hole in the wall. I ordered a strawberry margarita and found that a strawberry had never been near it. Clearly a flavored mix. We each had a shrimp taco and a fish taco. The shrimp had been so overcooked that it was like chewing on little lumps of plastic. The fish had no flavor at all as it hadn't been seasoned. We left with a feeling of \"Lesson learned.\""}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed.  Thought it would be morr authentic Mexican food, but it was rather Americanized.  My torta was meh. My friends fish taco was huge, however, and she said it was good.  Food's expensive here, but if atmosphere is what you're looking for, it will be a winner. The music was authentic!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down for this place.  I was craving mexican food.  I always see alot of cars here each time.  I ate a combination plate tostada and taco with beans and fideo. The salsa had a weird taste then they brought us hot sauce that one was alright.  Chicken taco tasted like it came out of the can. Avacado tostada tasted from the bag not fresh. I'm originally from El Paso, Texas. Used to eating all sorts of mexican food. Even crossing the border to Juarez to get our fix on tacos, seafood and flautas...was very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Average Mexican food.  Not really much to write, except average. There was nothing special about this place. I was not disappointed, but I would not return."}
{"text":"Came here about once a week when I lived a few blocks away. Can't go wrong with the Mexican flag plate, chimichanga, or carne picada dinner. Very good Mexican food on a consistent basis. Service is usually very good as well."}
{"text":"Where else can you get Sonoran enchiladas with homemade chorizo and an egg? A favorite with the locals! A family run restaurant which has been here since 1963. The red salsa is incredible!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive.  Our server, Steven, was great.  Friendly, polite and on top of things, we never had to ask for more iced tea.  He is the reason this is not a one star review, because the food was absolutely awful.  Even by Arizona standards, it was bad.  In our experience, Arizona has many things to recommend it, Mexican food is not one of them.  I've had better microwave burritos than what they served here, though.  My bean and cheddar burrito was tough and tasteless.  The beans tasted like they dumped them right out of a can, which isn't automatically a bad thing.  There are some fairly good refried beans out there, they just didn't buy any of the good ones.  My cheese enchilada was OK, but the red sauce was like ketchup.  I'll let my husband tell you what his tacos were like, since I didn't eat them I can't really give you the full measure of how bad they were.  I can tell you they were bad, though.  This was an expensive ($31) fail.  I don't think we'll be going back.  You should probably skip it as well."}
{"text":"Service: Good, very quick at refilling chips as soon as you get low. Chips and salsa were actually already set at the table for us when we were seated, which was nice - kind of makes you wonder how long they sat there though.  Food: Fish tacos were bland. Quesadillas are extremely lacking. Don't bother with them as you can get a better one literally anywhere else. Guacamole looks like runny green poo. Other items I've tried tasted pretty standard - not stand out or especially delicious, but edible.  Ambience: Large restaurant, always somewhat busy for lunch. Feels a bit dingy though.  Verdict: Mediocre. If you're not set on Mexican food I would suggest going next door to Cornish Pasty Co instead."}
{"text":"Pretty sure just thinking about the chicken chimi with salsa con queso right now is enough to make me wanna head there for lunch.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was fantastic. We were seated right away and provided with chips and salsa within minutes of being seated. Our waiter was really friendly, nice and attentive. I ordered a beef taco and rice and it was a great size for the price and delicious. The atmosphere is typical of your usual mexican restaurant and did not disappoint.  This place is also great if you are going with a group of people. The seating is accommodating to whatever group you have."}
{"text":"LOVE THEIR FOOD!   Our favorites are the green Chile chicken enchilada and beef tacos!!! :)"}
{"text":"Their green chile (anything) is phenomenal. Been there for both lunch and dinner, and they give you nice big portions. Parking is a bit cramped since you have to share it with Cheba Hutt, Cornish Pasty, a Dentistry, and some other places. I had to knock off a star because median that separates the booths is flimsy and so your neighbors are prone to rocking your booth/drinks/plates."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Rosita's. While it isn't life-changing, I really haven't found better Mexican food in another restaurant around town. When I lived in Vegas, I would crave food from this place and couldn't find anything that was even a close comparison.   It is definitely unassuming, located in a little strip mall at Dobson and Guadalupe. There's predominantly banquette-seating with just a few tables that are half banquette, half chairs. There is a bar and a dining room - they often offer the option of seating in either area and I recommend the dining room over the bar. It is brighter, more comfortable, and I feel that the service is more attentive.   They serve delicious salsa and chips to start, and also have a hot sauce that has a good kick. If you're interested in an appetizer, our standby is the Cheese Crispi - either plain or with Green Chiles. Adding some of the aforementioned hot sauce is a good plan for nice flavors :)   My \"go to\" is their Green Machaca Beef Burro, deep fried, with Cheese inside. I have had Machaca at a few other restaurants and theirs is definitely at the top - it is a stewed shredded beef and is nice and moist with LOTS of flavor. I order it as the Burro deep fried, which is basically a chimichanga but without the sour cream and guacamole.   Another fun item is the Rosita Chiquita Sampler - you choose 4 mini items from a list - I usually get a Chicken Taco, Beef Flauta, Green Chile Beef (served in a little tortilla bowl), and a Green Corn Tamale. This comes with rice and beans and is nice when you aren't sure exactly what you want and you can instead try a little of everything.   I don't order dessert here very often, but have had their sopapillas (fried dough with honey, cinnamon, and sugar) which are a bit iffy (sometimes good, sometimes not)   The service at Rositas is typically pretty good, although not always the most upbeat. They tend to be quick and efficient. They serve their sodas in HUGE glasses so that you don't have to wait for refills (because you typically don't need one)   The pricing is a bit high for what you get, in my opinion - their prices have gone up $3-$4 an entree over the past 7 or 8 years, and the quality has stayed exactly the same.   That said, it is delicious and a great standby - check it out!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible, not to mention overpriced. I felt sick to my stomach for the next 2 days. Avoid."}
{"text":"Excellent chips, salsa, tamales, enchiladas, chimis, tacos!  They even had posole, horchata & fideo that was delicious!  Don't listen to negative reviews...must have not had authentic Mexican food.  Try it...you'll love it!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight looking to enjoy some decent Mexican food. Unfortunately, the food and service were less than decent. My boyfriend and I were extremely impressed with how terrible it was. First, our server got an attitude when HE brought me the wrong beer, despite my unnecessary apologies. Second, my boyfriend ordered a carnitas burrito which was small, came with nothing but tortilla and meat, and the tortilla wasn't even cooked. For $9.25. Talk about over priced. I would think a near $10 burrito would at LEAST come with rice and beans but that's a $3 up charge. For rice and beans......seriously? My chicken tacos tasted like they came straight out of a can. Four tacos for $10.95. I would happily pay that much for four tacos if the meat was half decent and the toppings were fresh. Needless to say, not the best customer service, outrageously overpriced, and poor quality of food. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Two stars for good service.  Canned enchilada sauce and flavorless beans and rice Don't do it for me....Next!"}
{"text":"Oh jeez, no. I came here after escaping the airport, thinking that any place I went would have better tacos than where I was coming from (Pennsylvania.) I was so, so wrong. This place served me the whitest white people tacos that money can buy. Plain, unseasoned shredded chicken, flour tortillas with diced tomatoes and cilantro on top. WHAT. Where are the doubled-up corn tortillas?! Where are the jalapenos, the Pico de Gallo, the Salas?! When I asked for hot salsa she offered me the same one that came with the chips. Uber disappointed."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place numerous times and never tried it until today! Was pleasantly surprised by the portions and prices! I highly recommend the combo platters -I got the burro and tostada with rice and my bf got the enchilada and Taco with beans! Huge portions for 9$ a piece. Place was clean and server was friendly. My only complaint is the chips needed some salt and my rice was a bit bland.  Overall good experience, if you looking for a casual cheap lunch or dinner check them out!"}
{"text":"Horrible. This place has not changed since I worked there 24 years ago. Granted, I was the worst busser in the world, but that does not excuse the bad food, old decor, tired menu, and lackluster staff.   The food is essentially taco bell but more expensive. The guacamole is neon green without flavor, the food swims in grease, and the beans and rice are often cold by the time they get to the table.  There are better restaurants just a few minutes away."}
{"text":"2nd review for what used to be one of our favorites... used to be. Came here today- We finished our basket of chips before the drinks came out. There were three tables in the restaurant so not sure what took so long, but we were well beyond thirsty. Husband ordered his carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream on the side, so naturally it came out with it on top.  I had the huevos rancheros and asked for a corn instead of a flour tortilla- you guessed it, I got the flour.  Our waitress took so long to check on us we just decided to deal with it and eat anyway since we were hungry. Halfway done with the food before we were asked how it all was. Just responded with a shrug.  Sat there for 10 minutes after we finished eating. Where is she? Where is our tab? Nowhere to be seen. Finally my husband got up and found her socializing behind the scenes. He asked her to bring the check.  Okay so get this.  Each diet Pepsi (which were flat) cost $2.50. No refills were offered. Carne burrito served enchilada style A LA CARTE came out to be around $14... Lol! What?! My huevos was around $10. The food was ok. The service was negligent and deplorable.   This experience cost $31.50... seems high for Rositas, especially given there were a few booths that looked pretty dilapidated and there was a hole in the wall in front of one.  1 star... for the food today, and fond memories in visits past. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"Lunch.  Affordable lunch prices.  Taco, Rice and Beans were very good.  Red tamale was bland.  Lunch peeps had the green tamales and they were better than the red.   Server was very attentive.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! My family and I have been coming here since I was a little kid. Jessie is always our server and she's the best! The two taco plate or the Pozole is heaven in your mouth!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new Mexican food place today so I stopped in and was quite disappointed. The food was mediocre at best, but the service was quite good. I ordered vegetable fajitas and there was minimal flavor. The guacamole was just a paste with no veggies and this is what really bummed me out. I loooove guac. The salsa was ok, but nothing special. Wishing I had just skipped this place altogether."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Second time I've been in here and they have charged me for items placed on my plate. I was charged $2.50 for small dribble of onions $2.50 and for refried beans which I ate in four bites. They charged me for rice and green Chile.  By the time I got out of there with a ice tea drink I was charged over $20 for a very simple small meal. The waitress was running from one area to the other area and was extremely slow getting to our table. There was nobody attending the bar area and we were there for 30 minutes and never seen anybody in that area."}
{"text":"Great family friendly place. A Tempe tradition for generations.  Great chips and salsa.  The mole enchiladas are my favorite.  Very good rice and beens. Friendly staff who remember regulars."}
{"text":"Love this place..have been going here for over 32 years. The wonderful lady Jessie is my favorite waitress"}
{"text":"it's two years later and tried Rositas again for lunch.  I asked if they still had the \"Rosita's Special\" and they said yes.  I was brought what looked like a Rositas Special, but it was far from it.  (btw a Rositas Special is a cheese crisp with green chili burro filling and folded over.  tasty).  On one end of the Special was melted Colby cheese (as original) but the other half was nacho cheese...aka Velveeta)...it was aweful.  The cook must have run out of shredded Jack cheese and used the nacho sauce in its place.  I complained, but nobody seemed to care.  To top off the meal, the brought us someone else's ticket...around $30.  Ours was half that.  Still the dive it was two years ago.  Cant understand why there were so many customers there."}
{"text":"What happened?!?!? This use to be my favorite Mexican spot near campus, but apparently it's heading downhill fast.  Went in for a quick bite around 8, the restaurant was almost empty, but the three servers still seemed way to busy to be bothered with my order.  Ten minutes to take an order is ridiculous.  Once my food finally hit the table, it was another 12 mins before I found the bus boy to track down my server because my order was wrong.  The food is consistently average, but the service is just awful right now."}
{"text":"All you can eat menudo, great service and a good place for a margarita and sum drinks"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and fair prices. There's a reason this place has been in business for so long. Interior could use updating, but the foods some of the best around."}
{"text":"3 weeks ago, I dined alone at Rosita's on Guadalupe, usually I dine there with my family, but they were out of town. I ordered two beef tacos with rice and beans. Already the service was below par. The hostess was rude and the waitress was even worse. When I did get my food I took a bite into my taco and chipped my tooth on a chicken bone, the size of a quarter. I'm not sure why the tacos were chicken and not beef like I ordered. I asked for the manager. She was of course very kind. She took an incident report and placed the large bone in an envelope and sealed it. She told me the general manager would call me, but he never did. It was gross biting into a big bone and the restaurant never even cared enough to contact me and ask if I was okay."}
{"text":"Interesting little place. Pretty similar to all run of the mill inexpensive Mexican places.  Came here on a lunch break from work and it was bumping. Food was good, pretty bug menu, although limited vegetarian options.   I generally try to avoid heavy food mid-day so this might nor be a repeat Lunch spot but my bean and cheese Burrito was worth the $5 :-)"}
{"text":"We've been searching for really good vegetarian Mexican food in Tempe for about two years now. Rosita's is definitely it. Our server, Lupe, was super friendly and helpful. He let us know that the green chile sauce isn't vegetarian, but recommended alternatives and made sure that we were okay with other ingredients in the food. I had the chile relleno platter and my fiance had the tamales. We each had a margarita with lunch, and the bill still hit under $30. Great service and great food; we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"i keep going here. i don't really know why. i think maybe they're using an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!  better than the one on university.  delicious salty chips and 2 different salsas. giganto sodas.  average tacos (the chips and salsa make up for it).  probably will go there tomorrow."}
{"text":"Good, but not amazing, \"traditional arizona \" mexican food.  for some reason, i've had about five friends who have worked here as servers, and they all stuck around for at least a year, so i imagine the owners/managers are pretty cool.  on sundays they have discounts on pitchers of beer and margaritas all day. the food is good and relatively inexpensive, and the select apps are half off during normal HH times.   located right on hardy and university (wedged between Cornish Pasty and Cheba Hut) it's convenient and has good service."}
{"text":"My co-worker raved about this place and said it was her favorite Mexican food place. Never again. The food was okay, not bad but not great. Priced very high for what you get. It was very busy, so I understand slow service, but one of the servers knocked a bowl of salsa off the table which hit the floor and sprayed all over me. Salsa in my hair, on my face, neck, blouse, slacks and shoes. Completely covered. They did not acknowledge the incident,  when I asked for more napkins I was made to feel it was an inconvenience. They finally brought me a wet paper towel and the bill at the same time. No discount or offer to clean my outfit. Not even an apology. I had to return to work and meetings stained in salsa. After explaining to other coworkers what had happened, they exchanged stories of their own bad experiences at this Rosita's. Be warned."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 100 times. All i can say is that  this place is somewhat inconsistent.  Tonight the bar area was a 5 for sure.  6 months ago it was a 2. So tonight for happy hour all bottled beer 2.5 and well drinks 3 bucks. Half off appetizers and an awesome bartender. Ordered the cheese crisp with machaca beef and a sampler.  All was hot to the table and super tasty.  Give this place a go if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This is traditional AZ mexican food and has been for several decades.  The food is good and resonably priced being near ASU.  A great place to go when no one can make up their mind on where to eat."}
{"text":"I went to Rosita's as a reward lunch with my team from work yesterday, let me tell you going anywhere with us is a challenge in itself!, we have Juan aka lunchbox, who can certainly eat his share and more! We did give Rosita's a headsup that we were coming even though there is just 8 of us, but the place is always busy! We got there and were seated right away and got Lauren as a waitress,  she took great care of us! She even got assitance to bring exta chips and salsa which by the way was super yummy! Love their super size cups, never have to ask for a refill they're like a half gallon size, perfect for my diet coke addiction!  I decided in 2013 to enjoy life more so I ordered dessert first, the shortcake soppapiah, fabulous! I had the spincah enchilada with white sauce which was melt in your mouth goodness! I am a lucky girl because I sampled my coworkers lunch, a tasty bite of a chimichanga, and a fajita! Oh yes and I got a bite of the fried ice cream too, can you say pajama jeans, I needed them by the time I was done! Everything was fantastic, service included!"}
{"text":"Very unspectacular food.  There are so many other fantastic Mexican restaurants to go to I would pass this one up.    Chips:    Average from the bag variety.   Salsa:  Sitting out all day on the tables.  How fresh is that? Hot Salsa:  In a plastic squeeze bottle.  That's all that needs to be said.   Refried Beans:  bland. Tostada:  Average Bean Burrito:  Average  I know, that's a lot of beans!  But again, I've had some pretty tasty refried beans, and this place doesn't cut the mustard!    I spent $15 after tax and tip for a 2 item combo and a coke.  It's not worth it. And you're not paying for any atmosphere either."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rosita's for years now. First started going to the one in Tempe but now that I live in Mesa I frequent this location most often. If there is one great thing about Rosita's it is the consistency, I have never been disappointed and the food is always great. The food is served quickly too so if you're starving like I usually am when I come the wait isn't long for it to be made. Portion size is fantastic, you get a lot of bang for your buck and a buck goes a long way. The girlfriend and I can get a great meal with leftovers for around $25. The only knock I can give is the service itself, it varies from time to time and usually tends to be on the subpar side."}
{"text":"I love Rosita's! The food is awesome and the happy hour is fantastic. I go at least once a week. I highly recommend the spinach enchiladas and the shredded beef tacos."}
{"text":"Food and service is excellent! Salsa is fresh and delicious and the guac is equally delicious with a hint of jalapeño. They must've included a bit of jalapeno in the fajita veggies in my chicken quesadillla because my mouth was craving milk.  Our server brought my hubby a free fried ice cream since it was his birthday. :)  They also have gave me 2 free dinners for buying over $30 in gift certificates.  We loved Jessie, our server!  However, they don't have jalapeño cream cheese and the women's bathroom is old and little gross.  Just go to the bathroom elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place has great customer service. However, the food quality is poor. The prices are too high for the portions and the pricing. I was not pleased with the food at all. If you want authentic mexican food, do not come here."}
{"text":"Avoid.   Quality control is missing from: the physical building, the seats, the service, and the food. I was so close to barfing about 2 hours  after having a taco/chili rellano plate.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Not authentic Mexican, but definitely authentic Arizonan Mexican food. Where else can a native AZ'an get a cheese crisp without judgement? It's old and dive-ish after being there for so long, but it's a nice place for a taste of my childhood. Good tamales, too."}
{"text":"I've had better from a \"Rosita's.\"  This place has the atmosphere down, but the food could use some work. All the ingredients are there and the menu is definitely a full one, but there's just something missing.  I would, however, recommend the salsa. Both the mild and hot are impeccable."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always feel like I'm walking into a grandma's kitchen when go. The chips and salsa are always fresh and tasty. The seasoned chicken burro enchilada style is my fav. It's pretty massive, and I can only finish it when I'm absolutely starving. The booths are big and comfy, and the bottomless beverages are always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"We used to go here back in the day and the food was awesome.  Just went back this week after a long hiatus and disappointing is an understatement .  Went for lunch, service was so so.  Room was very hot and place hasn't been renovated I years - update your decor!  Husband and I got lunch specials of tacos and burrito, to start a small saucer of queso dip.  Chips and salsa were ok, tacos were good but queso dip was nasty.  I loved coming here because not many places have fideo - it tasted like nothing even when I added salt.  So fit two lunch specials, two iced teas and a saucer of cheese whiz $32!!!  Overpriced and disappointing...better places with better prices all over the valley"}
{"text":"So disappointed after visiting. Was looking for \"authentic\" Mexican food, had done some research before coming to Phoenix and what I remember looking up for Rosita's did not match what we were served here. My husband's \"tamale\" was nothing more than just shredded chicken wrapped in a corn tortilla. Arroz con pollo was delicious, but not like a traditional arroz con pollo, comes with only one tortilla (doesn't appear to be homemade either), and a weird steamed cabbage/carrot/corn salad on the side with absolutely no seasoning. Chips and salsa was mediocre at best. Someone's review says they are homemade chips, I highly doubt that. Haven't gone back and figured it out but pretty sure we were overcharged as well but couldn't read the ticket to know for sure."}
{"text":"Was looking all over Phoenix for good Mexican food.  Found nothing. Discouraged. Decided to go to Scottsdale. On the way found rositas. Great food good value. Great customer service.  Friendly. Plus the margaritas are amazing"}
{"text":"I was in the area for a business meeting and a co-worker and I went in to grab a quick lunch.  The service was quick which is about the only positive thing you will read in this review.  Upon being taken into the front room to be seated the first thing I noticed was the extreme heat.  I alerted the hostess to the issue and she said that it was a hot room and would seat us elsewhere.  The other bigger room was cooler, but far from comfortable.  I am sorry but not having good air conditioning in Tempe/Phoenix is unacceptable.  Figuring we could manage the heat, we ordered guacamole to start.  I am an avocado lover and consequently eat guacamole all the time.  I have NEVER seen guacamole like this before.  It looked puke green and was completely pureed, the consistency of liquidy sour-cream.  In addition to the guacamole, we also ordered a quesadilla.  How hard is it to make a decent quesadilla? Whatever the case, Rosita's quesadilla was cold, hard, and seemed like it was just reheated from the day before.    We paid without eating 98% of the food.  I will never return to Rosita's. Disgusting hot dump."}
{"text":"We havent been here for years because the service last time was terrible.  But we decided to give it a try again. NOTHING has changed. They werent busy at 330 pm. But we waited at least 10 minutes before being seated. Then another long wait for someone to take our drink order.  The chips were hard and tasted terrible.  The service never got better.  The furniture is old worn out. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Fine Mexican food is a misnomer here! This place is average at best. I ordered the Carnitas. They were very dry and the flavor was nothing to write home about. The beans and rice that came with the plate were pretty average. I ordered water with lemon to drink and the water tasted terrible even after squeezing the lemon into it. Overall I would not recommend this place if you like good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great AZ Sonoran style Mexican food. I've been coming here for probably 40 years. I particularly like the chicken chili relleno platter."}
{"text":"As a Mexican myself this food was not good what so ever it was very disappointing I love guacamole and the guacamole was disgusting I've been here twice and both times I was very disappointed the only thing that was good was our margaritas and that was it I don't recommend this place AT ALL unless they've improved on it in the last 4 months and for a Mexican to say IT IS NOT GOOD that says a lot! !"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had the best authentic Mexican food ever I have gone here several years and I just love the food the flavor and the tastes of their food is amazing I try to come here at east every 2 months and I came in today saw they had a few new servers and i am so pleased they are so nice attentive and just show that they are happy to be working here defiantly know how to serve food to the paying customers the one name i got was Justin the other was just helping out while Justin was busy but he was  just so very happy and had such a sweet smile come and let them serve you defiantly worth a good TIP$"}
{"text":"I went here last week and I was very please. I have a gluten allergy and I called ahead and the hostess was very knowledgeable. I couldn't eat the chips or corn tortillas because they flash fry them SO they fire grilled my tortillas for me. I was impressed how they went out of their way to help and did not act as though it was an inconvenience. The meal they suggested was above my expectations. I don't know how many options they do have for GF but I was pleased with my meal. My husband and our friend are not gluten free and they both enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"I went to Rosita's for the first time tonight after driving by it for about 20 years on my way to other establishments. Tonight was the night to try it out because a place we know we like looked really busy. The entry way was super crowded (not from being too busy) as customers who enter have to walk around the customers who are in line paying for their meals. It seemed like my kids were getting in people's way. I'll be the first to notice when my kids are being annoying, but in defense of their innocence on this occasion, I must say they had nowhere safe to stand as we waited for the hostess to return. My toddler was almost taken out by a bag of takeout food being offered to a customer standing in the very crowded foyer. How could I have explained that tragedy to his grandparents?   When we were finally taken to the \"dining room\" I felt as if I had been magically swept away to a 1970's Waffle House. The lighting in this room -which consisted of ceiling fans and recessed can lights- could truly only be understood by folks who have found themselves in police interrogation rooms. The sunniness of the room does nothing for the ambiance, as it only makes patrons aware of how many crushed chips are on the floor and how the decor is reminiscent of the living room of an 85 year old \"winter visitor\" from Minneapolis. Normally the decor of a place isn't something I would critique, but I would expect something a little more pleasant when price range is considered. It's like being asked to pay the price of a bottle of Dom and instead receiving Boone's Farm Wine. No, it doesn't break the bank, but seriously, this is AZ; some of our best Mexican food is served on a paper plate. I would never critique these places for their lack of ambiance. This place, however, with their $6 (for one) shrimp taco, doesn't warrant the price tag.   Upon being seated our waitress took our drink orders. I decided to have the chicken mole (12.95) and my husband had the green chili chimi dinner (10.95). I think the kids' meals were a pretty good deal and I liked that I was able to order soup for my little guy. After our drinks came, we waited and waited to have someone bring us chips and salsa. We began to wonder if they were in fact complimentary here, as numerous members of the staff walked by without offering them. I finally asked our waitress for some as she walked by. She looked at me like I had a butt growing in the middle of my forehead and said, \"yeah, sure,\" and kept walking. About 5 minutes later she stopped a busboy right in front of our table and told him that when he \"had the time\" he should get us some chips. I was mildly annoyed.  He stopped what he was doing (I guess he had the time) and got them for us. Thanks big guy!   When the food arrived I was in shock at the portion size. The meat on my plate was enough to serve my whole family. In my opinion this isn't always a good thing. I would rather be served less food and charged a smaller price. These grotesque portions have led to our country's reputation in the global community as the land of lard. Enchanting. The chicken mole itself was decent, nothing to write sonnets about, but it was good. It was served with some iceberg lettuce (tepid from the hot plate), pinkish tomatoes (delightfully flown in from Chile, I'm sure), and a warm, soft tortilla on the side. I liked it well enough. The boy's soup (ablondigas) was \"mildly seasoned\" exactly as the menu proclaimed. The prevailing flavor was that of the saltines we crumbled over the top. Was this bad? No. He's 3, he likes \"mildly seasoned\". He also seemed pleased with his very large meatball. My daughter must have enjoyed her taco, because she left no evidence of its existence on her plate. My husband's chimi was really good. In fact, if we find ourselves there again, I'd suggest splitting one of those with him. It was enormous.   The bill came to $39 and some change. I felt a little cheated, as I know places in this town where the experience would have been a bottle of Dom at a Boone's Farm price. At least I'll get some \"not too bad\" warmed over chicken mole out of the deal."}
{"text":"We decided tonight to explore Mesa and find a good Mexican. Our selection for tonight was Rosita's. The atmosphere was a tad old but some holes in the walls are often unpolished gems. But this gem was in need of some updating. The service was decent, a few times we were left waiting for a bit and the dining room wasn't crowded at all.   The food was ok, the fresh salsa had the right amount of heat. The first round of chips were freshly made but the following baskets tasted as it from the bottom of an over cooked basket. The pricing for most of the menu very over priced. My pork carnitas chimi's were delicious and very moist though. The retried beans were not very creamy and lacked flavor. The queso dip was quite small for the large price and not very fresh as I am accustomed to. The soda was served in a very large glass and my bf beers were good lol as he had two. Overall not a bad selection but a bit overpriced for the quality of service and food."}
{"text":"Good choices of meals and sides, etc.  Food comes out super duper fast, like minutes.  Tried the shredded beef chimichanga.  It was pretty good.  Refried beans were good.  Chips were okay.  Salsa was good.  The fideo is a little bland.  Needs salt and sour cream.  The fried ice cream isn't warm or fresh but it tasted pretty good.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but is decent and not to expensive.  Hostess was flat but the server we had was really friendly and a great server."}
{"text":"We are staying overnight in Phoenix before flying out tomorrow morning after vacationing out West. The hotel recommended this place. Great choice. Perhaps the best Mexican food we've had in a long time if not ever. Husband had a combo plate with 8 choices. I had the arroz con polo. Both were delicious. Chips hot and fresh and salsa good. Large portions. Betsy was our waitress and she was helpful, efficient and friendly. Don't worry about the three star reviews. If you're near the airport and hungry, check out Rosita's!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. I asked the hotel concierge for a recommendation for a nearby Mexican restaurant and we landed here. I ordered the veggie fajitas burrito and the fajita veggies were barely cooked. I ordered the burrito \"wet\" with red sauce on top and it tasted as though it came out of a can. Typically with a wet burrito there is cheese sprinkled on the top - but Rosita did not include any. Also, the tortilla chips tasted as though they were made with old cooking oil. If you're starving and there's nothing else open, then this place is a good option."}
{"text":"Rositas is great for semi-authentic Mexican food. Their margaritas are great too. Food comes out quickly. Price is average. Never had an issue here."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Rosita's was after we moved right down the street and not disappointing.The food was about what we expected but better.First rate hot sauce,as good as the sauce my husband makes.And that's good. Service was always great as we sit in the lounge or even at the bar when we go.Awesome happy hour,2$ beers,half off appetizers.What could be better!"}
{"text":"All I can say is very bland!  Their chicken fajita bowl had no flavor and their spanish rice was so so.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wowza! Huge menu just like the portions! Many locals are here and often when the specialty soups are on, there'll be a line!"}
{"text":"I go there for lunch often.  The food has always been great, and we're able to get in and out in time to get back to work in time, atmosphere is casual...not a fancy place, but it's comfortable.  Service can be great or not that great depending on the server...but overall, we love it and will keep going back."}
{"text":"I miss Rosita's.  I've not lived in Arizona in a few years, so perhaps it's gone downhill.  However, their chips and salsa were always fantastic.  I could get full just from that.  And their chimichangas were to die for.  I always went during lunch, as it was just up the road from work.  It was cheap, quick, good service, and tasty for the price."}
{"text":"While we were in Phoenix for the weekend all I wanted was to eat at a really amazing Mexican place. But, everywhere we went was fast food, order at the counter. That isn't what I wanted.   We finally found Rosita's. The salsa was delicious (and I am picky). The food and the service was outstanding and the price was perfect.   I was going to take pictures but, I was too busy shoveling food into my mouth and I forgot. Super great option for Mexican. So much better than any of the chains."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice and the environment is set to the mood of the night or the day the restaurant is always very clean, the staff are very hospitable. When it comes to the food they provide you with chips and salsa and hot sauce very yummy then your food comes out very hot the plate is presented very nicely the food is very fresh when it comes to the staff they continue to help you no matter what until you leave and then make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Great food! My family has been dining here for years. Their menudo and beef tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb me. It beat out all the local competition and I will definitely be back. We had a wonderful experience and delicious food. Our server Alycia was fantastic, she was very attentive, friendly and polite.  All of the staff from the host to the server greeted us with a smile. The atmosphere was very authentic and homie. We will definitely be back! I recommend the cheese enchilada special."}
{"text":"In AZ I expect a lot for Mexican food and I want power packed flavor. There is just too much competition not to have a flavor buster of yummy awesome goodness. I also think relatively fast service or moderately paced service should come included as the food is mostly already prepped.   Well........ 0 for 2.   The food is average, we got tacos of all types, nachos, rice, beans, chimis etc. It's all bland. And the service is crappy.   That's about it. Wish I could go into more detail but seriously. There are tons better places to go."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the decor really needs to be updated the restaurant is in need of a remodel the walls, booths and carpet seem very used up and dirty. Maybe if they fixed that stuff I would go back, there are many newer places that are just as good"}
{"text":"Been eating here for years.  It's our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Our only complaint over the years has been the poor bathrooms.  They have always been dirty, run down, unkept. We try and avoid them at all costs."}
{"text":"Came into Rositas this afternoon.  Was greeted by Christina who turned out to be my server today. Ordered the Carne Picada and a cold refreshing beverage. Service with Christina was better than epic so big shout out and kudos to all that she does.  Definitely coming back for more. Thanks for all you do and continue to do.   Thank your Rositas for all of the outstanding food that you make."}
{"text":"Horrible, totally disgusting food. The waiter asked how the food was and asked us if we wanted boxes, being we took about two bites of our meal. We laughed and said no boxes, please...insinuating, the food is horrible. He smiled and discretely nodded in agreement, he knew the food was horrible too and works there. I don't know who would even run a restaurant with gross food , what's the point in running a crappy restaurant. The water tasted like sewage even after adding 6 lemon wedges to it. A Mexican restaurant that is too cheap to provide customers with bottles of habanero sauce or even tobasco for that matter. The food tastes so horrible they should at least provide that. Crappiest joint I've ever been. I'm laying in bed at a hotel with a rubber boot settling in my tummy."}
{"text":"This was another location that was on the list of places to try while in town. I did, and enjoyed the food very much. Being from South Jersey and now living in MD there are cookie cutter Mexican and Southwest places throughout the area. So that being said even an OK Mexican Southwest joint is going to be fantastic for me. There are a few staples that make places stand out for four stars and this place had them. There are a few things in addition to the food that makes this place great.   \"The Good\" -  The staff is very attentive and polite. The fresh chips (which were awesome) arrived before I could crack open the menu. The Dr. Pepper stayed filled the entire meal and the food came out fast and was delicious;. I ordered a combination platter to try some different things that I like taco, tamale, etc... all were very good and delicious, the plate was packed but did not have that ...\"Oh here are the sides with a few small bits of the main. It was a good balance and tasted even better. - The Salsa is also homemade, tastes great and is a great start to the meal.  \"The Meh\" - When you are told to lock your doors while inside ... take the advice. - In a strange out of left field observation ... not a lot of windows.  \"The Bad\" - Nothing really bad to comment on."}
{"text":"The service was great and we were seated quickly. That's where the good part of this review ends. Unfortunately, the chips were cold - which is odd for 11am in the morning, they should be piping hot, right out of the fryer. The 'salsa fresca' was bitter, which tells me it wasn't made this morning. Maybe change the name to salsa vieja, to tell the truth. I ordered a taco salad and I received about 5oz of beef fajita meat/onions. There was at least 1lb of lettuce and little else. The service was quick and they were courteous, which is why I'm rating it two stars."}
{"text":"Green chili burrito smothered in green sauce and melted cheese, rice and beans - time and time again - one of my fav meals anywhere.  I have tried green burros everywhere - Rositas is always the best.  Chips and salsa (and hot sauce) are the best around -and margaritas are great!  Sit at the bar and Mando always is the best bartender around.  I love Rosita's!!!"}
{"text":"It's easier to think about the things that I don't like about Rosita's than it is to think about why I eat there every now and then.  Pretty much, I only eat there when I'm either extremely hungover and don't want to drive any further than I absolutely have to or when I'm in a hurry because it's so close to my house and the food comes quickly.  Basically, this place has got two things working in its favor:  1. It is extremely close to my house 2. Damn good salsa.  However, this is a Tempe Hotspot for some of the ugliest and weirdest people around, including some old drunk dude I always see staggering around University and Hardy with the same look of bewilderment.  One time, I'm pretty sure he was being thrown out because everyone looked mad at him and he walked out with an air of indignance.  Another time, I heard a different old man cough, then fart, then cough again.  These are the kinds of people you will see at Rosita's.  Overall, the food, though not great, is not bad.  Yes, it's greasy, but if you're hungover, you'll feel better.  It's fine for what it is.  I really enjoy the chimichangas."}
{"text":"Would have given 3 stars based on the food, but the server (Brianna) was what made this place get only 1 star. We (4 of us) went for Cinco de Mayo and they weren't busy when we got there, about 430.  Brianna took our order, another guy brought our drinks, she didn't bother to tell him I wanted lemons for my water.  She didn't bother to ring in margaritas on the rocks instead of frozen, and when she finally came back to the table, she just kinda chuckled and said she didn't write it down and told them to take the wrong drinks to us anyway because we would be happy since they had alcohol in them....UMMM NO! it is not okay, we asked for more chips, she walked by them and kept walking.  A few minutes later we passed by them and got our own.    Asked for extra napkins...we had to get our own.  She didn't seem to do anything right. Asked to speak with a manager, Forrest, he seemed very timid and unsure of everything.  Not sure how he is even a mgr.  All in all she shouldn't be allowed to be a server, she also discriminates offering certain tables stuff while doing not even the bare minimum for others."}
{"text":"My better half suggested I eat here when I visited Phoenix. I think he likes it so much because he has memories here.  The food was ok. The cheese crisp is really good. The best part of Rosita's was the prickly pear margaritas."}
{"text":"Service is top notch. I, go there for the best red chile in town! One point I did have an issue with their service and manager that had arizona syndrome but I have yet to see that person there ever again. They take care of their customers and ALWAYS serve great food. The mole and sopa was not quite as tasty as I like but decent. Great drinks as well. Rositas is a diamond in the rough. High 5!! HU"}
{"text":"Today we decided on a take out order.  I have never been inside to have a meal, but i have heard all good things about this place, so why not?!    we ordered simple things: a tamale, a green chile pork burrito with rice and beans and two fish tacos.  the orders came with chips and salsa.   i have one basic question: WHERE ARE THE FLAVORS?   the salsa was pretty flavorless.  the green chile pork was described as \"not bad\" but the rice was dry and beans with the slice of cheese draped over the top were still bland.  the tortillas for the fish tacos seemed like they were microwaved rather than cooked on a comal and it had so much garnish on the top that we couldn't see the fish.  the chips tasted like they were fried in old grease.    i would not ever recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Average salsa and all around dirty.  I cannot give a good rating when the menus, restaurant and restrooms are repulsive.  Sorry!  Staff was very nice, but owners should think of replacing carpet, paint and pressure steaming the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my friend Sandy. It was nice and quiet despite being busy and lunchtime. We were seated right away and not 5 minutes later, we were blessed with chips and very delicious salsa to begin our lunch, as we both perused our menus, deciding what to have.  Our waitress was an older lady named Jessie & she was very helpful with suggestions on what to try and the daily special. Sandy has been here a few times and decided to try their Street Tacos. I went with the Daily Special, which was 2 Cheese Enchiladas, rice, & beans. We each got a soda to complete our orders & as we waited for our meals, we caught up on things and enjoyed the complimentary chips & salsa.  Jessie was very efficient and great about checking on us, especially after we got our food. Our meals came out piping hot, looking & smelling very good, & we both enjoyed our lunch. My enchiladas were made just right & the cheese melted in my mouth upon each bite! Sandy said her Street Tacos were the best she'd tried in a while & I knew that I would definitely come to this restaurant again.   Great food + fantastic service=return visits!"}
{"text":"(This review is from 2011) the rice was a bit dry. beans were good. shredded beef taco was good. shredded chicken taco was okay, the chicken looked a bit odd lol. the beef tamale was okay. tortilla chips were okay. the salsa was good but the chile was not good. all this was not worth ~$14.15 cause of the taste"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful if you know what you like. I always try something different when we go and have never been disappointed, even the hamburgers are enjoyable.   Unfortunately the service is a crap shoot. Sometimes we will go and the servers are attentive and active; they make you feel almost like family. But others, usually when we end up in the lounge, can have large breaks where the server does not even appear in the room. I have witnessed times when the only server is the bartender who focuses on flirting with a few customers and leave the rest of the customers unattended for prolonged periods. Other times my table has waited close to 15 minutes for a refill.  If you go, try to avoid the bar. Either way the food is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"More like Rosita's mediocre Mexicanish edibles.  I remember eating here, but nothing about the food was memorable.  What I do remember was that it was the type of restaurant that you see in small town horror movies.  I'm thinking the old lady retired, the kids are retarded and don't know anything about the food, and everything has just quietly been sliding downhill for years.  Eventually when they go out of business, (old) people will think \"Oh.  That's too bad.  What happened?\"  The answer:  nothing for many many years, and that was the problem."}
{"text":"I really love this place but tonight not just the salsa but also the hot sauce was sour. Maybe it was because of xmas I assume theu closed. We asked for the manager and he brought out fresh salsa that was also sour. I cant think of any reason that would be acceptable. I know for a fact this placw jas a clean kitchen but maybe they need to revisit the inventory and product rotation. We got 10 percent off. But so me one please give me a reason why I should go back? Thank fully I did not get sick. Also let me add I love their crispy chicken tacos.  Tonight is just wasnt good.  Let me add that I have provably ate 100 of them over The last 15 years."}
{"text":"This place smells like bug spray. I give it a F. The carpet needs to be removed. The resturant has a stinch smell when you first walk in.  My daughter and & I was their many years ago. And while we were eating our lunch. A cockroach was crawling on the wall next to us. We told the female waitress. And she told us to knock it to the floor and smash with our shoes. We will never ever go back their to eat. The food really isn't that good anways."}
{"text":"Hey Everyone ! Today, I was very satisfied with the service and the awesome food. I will certainly go back and eat their. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. My food came out steamy and smelled very delishous. I was very happy !"}
{"text":"i have been here twice and it was always great service and great food! just moved to the area, so I was happy to find a good Mexican food place"}
{"text":"My husband and I went about a month ago!! I usually take my left over home! But I didn't from here! I always order guacamole on the side but.... OH MY GOODNESS THIS GUACAMOLE WAS THE WORST!!!!AND I MEAN BAD BAD BAD!! MY husbands food was ok needless to say the ONLY thing I liked and enjoyed was the Margaritas lol  I like to give the benefit of the doubt so I will give it another try!"}
{"text":"Rosita's is awesome. I lived 2 blocks from here during my undergrad ASU days and it was my favorite place to get my Mexican food fix. There's nothing better in this part of Tempe as far as Mexican's concerned so I have no idea what some of the other reviewers are complaining about. Great salsa too."}
{"text":"We walked into this place to see not 1 but 2 hostesses just walking away from the hostess stand. It was several minutes before we were acknowledged despite the appearance of them being adequately staffed considering they weren't particularly busy. The chips and salsa arrived immediately -- salsa was good but chips were the greasy, stuck together variety. When I asked the waitress for recommendations (the menu is quite extensive) she replied, \"I don't really like mexican food but...\". Against my better judgement I ordered the arroz con pollo per her recommendation. I ate some of it, it was \"fine\", but I left about half on my plate and I NEVER leave food on my plate. It was also accompanied by steamed cabbage & other veggies which I found odd and have never experienced in a mexican restaurant before.   I'm glad I tried it .. but am glad I didn't have to go out of my way to get there & I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Waitress Jessie is very friendly and informative. We ordered a meal that we intended to share and it was brought on separate plates for us (bonus points for that). Food is good (had enchiladas). Salsa not too spicy (for me). Will come back when next craving Mexican food. From what I saw, the restaurant is clean. No complaints!"}
{"text":"If I could have a negative star I would!!  I paid $20 for 1 rolled taco/flautas w/black beans and one taco w/ beans!!!!   Are u kidding me????? F$uck this place! I tried to give benefit of doubt, boy was I wrong!  Rip off!   DO NOT EAT HERE, WASTE OF MONEY AND RIP OFF!  What a joke! Taco Bell is better!"}
{"text":"I would definitely say go with the Abondigas soup, or the Menudo! It always hit the spot no matter what time of day, it's also a really good hangover remedy. I would say avoid the Sonaran Enchilada only based on the fact that the sauce was bland, I come from a Hispanic family so I know when something is supposed to have a great flavor, and the Enchilada was not of them. The next thing I will complain about is that I ordered a breakfast burrito. I had no idea that the Chorizo was going to cost me an extra $5 dollars to add on to it. The egg was cooked like an omelette, and was not scrambled, and then the chorizo was spread across the burrito. So not only was it underwhelming but it was also bland. One last redeeming quality of this place is that they had a good happy hour."}
{"text":"tonight is saturday and we were the ONLY 3 people in there? yet, our server was below average...way below. had to ask twice for water and for beer refills. and salsa...had to ask twice for that as well.   my dish was ok. standard mex but very salty. i won't count our dinner companion because she is too picky (everything was wrong with her dish according to her). however, my girlfriend loved her fish with lettuce wrap dish...said it was \"the bomb\", a phrase she has rarely used since entering her mid 30's! our prickly pear margaritas were quite tasty though, so a grand 4 stars for that.  but what made me give it only 2 stars was the service...we never, ever expect much because we know how hard it is to be a server...however, with us as the only customers, the service tonight was way off. overall, 50 bucks for 3 entrees, 2 margaritas and 2 beers."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this place is the closest Mexican restaurant to me and that's the main reason I go there.   The food is generally pretty good but on multiple occasions I've gone there at later hours and noticed the chips to be extremely stale to the point where you can't really eat them. The salsa is good but not my favorite. The entrees I've had are always the best part though, which it always should be. I typically get the stacked enchiladas with shredded beef, which is good but could have more flavor, with rice and beans. On other occasions I've had a chicken chimichanga which was also good. Compared to some other Mexican restaurants, I can say there are other tastes out there that I prefer.   If they could make sure to have fresh chips and salsa the entire time they're open, I'd give them at least one more star. The food is good, but isn't out of this world amazing. I will be returning and plan on being a repeat customer thanks to the proximity of the restaurant to my house, and good service."}
{"text":"All the food here is very good and I recommend trying it all; but, the real reason we keep coming back to Rositas for the delicious Steak Fajitas!  They are cooked to perfection and have an excellent flavor profile that I consider to be the best in town.  This is a newer location and I am glad they opened up because we used to have to drive out to the avenues to eat these babies!  Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"This place is an Arizona classic. Will I am partial to their taco lunch special (yeah, I'm basic), their red chile is absolutely to die for. Great margaritas too. Always go with the top shelf, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So when my friend Kevin and I are looking for a beer fix, this is usually where we head. They have decent deals on pitchers and oh so edible salsa (personally I like the hot version) but that is where the love affair ends. And even though we have gone to this spot several times, I wouldn't say that either one of us are fans. We go for the convenience.  I've tried several items on the menu and have to say I've never been particularly impressed with any of them. That's a nice way of saying I've never had anything here that wasn't done better somewhere else. I have spent years learning the nuances of what makes a good Mexican plate and if you are looking for something authentic, this wouldn't be my first choice. On the other hand if you are happy with an Americanized version and in need of cheap beer, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes to be seated because of our party of 4 adults and 3 children.  Fortunately we had a great server.  Unfortunately we waited over an hour for food that never showed up.  This was on a Saturday evening at 7 pm but this place was dead.  There were maybe 10-15 other tables in the whole restaurant. We left hungry.   Never coming back."}
{"text":"very close to a 5...  so a 4.5 but yelp fails at halves  Only reason prevented me from a 5 is that it's more of a family place and traditional setting that I'd like to hang out with friends at... lots of kids... sorry I can't do the screaming thing.  Food wise... chips and salsa are SOO frickin good.  I used to stop by on my way home once a week and buy a big bag of chips and a big thing of their salsa...   Cookin is always good and comes out pipin hot exactly as ordered and I always order custom style and they have no problem making it the way I want it.  I've been going here for years and will continue to do so.  Also this one is better than the one on University."}
{"text":"A few years ago I had a coworker that loved to eat here so we'd come by often but I left that job and I hadn't been back until recently.   When I used to come regularly, I'd always get the Arroz con Pollo and it was so perfect.  The chicken was slow cooked so the meat was tender with so much flavor, the cooked vegetables and rice that accompanied were also delicious on their own without the chicken, it was a perfect meal.   I was excited to come back and I naturally ordered the same thing.  When it arrived I was so disappointed.   The juicy well prepared chicken had been replaced with long skinny strips of precooked chicken, it wasn't even edible.  The medley of vegetables had been replaced with just cabbage and the rice was the only edible item so that's what I ate.  We had ordered some guacamole to share and out came this mint green pudding.  It tasted like a tub of sour cream with a small amount of avocado put into the blender.  The margaritas were good though."}
{"text":"Meh.... Not bad. Not goooood though.  This is cheap college campus Mexican food where you get a LOT of food really fast for a small price.  The quality is there but this place is in no danger of taking home a \"Best Mexican Food in Tempe\" award."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas for Margarita Monday!  We split the Mexican pizza.  It was delicious.  We will be back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my parents favorite restaurants to eat at together. We all have been going there for many years. Their freshly made chips and two types of salsas are fantastic! My favorite is the bottomless pasole soup on weekends.... Especially after a night of drinking. The best hangover soup in my opinion."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Food is priced too much esp for Mexican. Guacamole here is just a guacamole cream. Wish I didn't pay cash so I could dispute. Never intend on coming back"}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Arizona, I have to eat here!!!! Their machaca beef chimichangas are excellent! Top it off with their margaritas is even better.  Their free salsa and chips are so good too! Their prices are inexpensive and their servings are humungous! You can't go wrong here. Great family atmosphere. I wish they can deliver to me in Los Angeles lol."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin, I was born in California, lived in Chicago for 15 years both of those locales had better Mexican food. Now after living in Arizona for the last year trying some restaurants and take away spots. What is the deal Mexican food here so close to the border yet the flavor and colors of this food don't illustrate any thing but drab and boring. Pureed guacamole is not what I was expecting when I ordered it to accompany my Combo Grande of Chile Rellano and Chicken enchilada, do not order the fideo way too soupy and it taste like watered down spaghetti O's not good. I love Mexican food but I won't be back here to have it."}
{"text":"We always sit in the lounge and we love it! It is an amazing hole in the wall Mexican joint. Good service and good food. Salsa is nice and chuncky but they hot it you want to test your wild side. But seriously it isn't a fancy place but nice food and great service."}
{"text":"This is really good basic tasty authentic food. Not expensive but big portion.   The Bean-dip is off the hook.  I like the Burros the best but of course the chimichangas can't go wrong either.   Machaca is off the hook good."}
{"text":"This was a stopover on our way to Texas, I wanted to eat Mexican food so I yelped this place, it's really good except, my fajita words not sizzling hot like I'm used to, and being from Los Angeles, expected homemade corn tortillas, The chicken had a good flavor and the salsa was OK, again being from Los Angeles we expect get a hot salsa, but if I was in Arizona again I would probably stop as it was tasty next time I will try a michelida. You would got 5 stars if you had homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"Cant be a five unfortunately. Nice place and would recommend, but they don't give you bean dip with your chips and salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Never again rositas!! My husband and I ordered some food for take-out Monday night for mindless football grub. We ordered two carne asada burritos, one with black beans and rice, and two beef tacos a la carte. The tacos were $5 a piece, and we're tiny! I'm sorry, but for $5 I could buy a much better taco at a gourmet taco restaurant. The burritos were also small and over-priced at $9.95. The black beans were an absolute joke; they literally emptied a can of beans into a container, with all the fluid that should be discarded when rinsing beans. Neither of us took a bite of those, and they ended up right in the trashcan.  The chips that came with our order were completely stale and chewy. The meat inside the burrito was tasty, so they can keep one star. Next time I want crappy Mexican food, I'll head to fillibertos and save myself $30."}
{"text":"WARNING FOR VEGETARIANS: This is one of those places that it is really difficult to order vegetarian, and when you get your food you are still not too sure everything is really meat or meat juice free, so it is kind of uncomfortable. We all (veggies) have experienced when we ask if something is made with meat, they say \"I don't know,\" and do not seem to care to find out. Or they say \"No,\" and you are doubtful, so you ask them to check, and they come back and confirm you were right. Ugh.  I don't mind if you do not have a veggie menu, but I know I am not the only guy asking  these questions.  The food was OK, but it is hard to evaluate when you are trying to figure out of you are eating meat or broth, and scared if it will make you sick all afternoon.  Anyway, the waiter was nice, if not that helpful. It is a hole in the wall, as others have described. There are better Mexican choices nearby, for veggie or carnivores. Check my reviews for more on that."}
{"text":"Place is still ok...the lights were turned up this time and I saw the restaurant in its full glory. It's clean, but a little dusty here and there. Service was fast and friendly and I forgot they served Pepsi...and none of these 8oz glasses of pepsi, either. We're talking, plastic cup, chug a lug cuz you're thirsty kind of big - I was looking the glass and was thinking, \"Is this a 40 oz diet pepsi goodness?!\"  The food was so-so. It hit the mexican food craving since Rosa's was closed on a Sunday. Damn you, Rosa's!  This is still an ok place for me to eat, but I won't deliberately go there unless all other mexican food options are exhausted -- and I will choose Rosita's over Serrano's any day.  ps Did I mention they have big glasses of Pepsi?! Oh yea, the no windows thing still freaks me out.  :D"}
{"text":"ARIZONA SOUL FOOD.  Love the food and atmosphere. A great old school Mexican joint. Nothing fancy just great Mexican food.   The chicken nachos on happy hour could feed 3-5 for $5. Serve their iced tea in big cups. Margaritas in big glasses and chips and salsa that will blow your mind.   Try the cheese crisp with guac or anything with guacamole... It is to die for."}
{"text":"First timers...had the stacked enchaladas with shredded beef and the Rosita's Special.  Good salsa and chips and the dinners were good as well.  Lot a food and carried home leftovers.  Friendly staff.  Will be back..."}
{"text":"My friend took me to Rosita's for greasy Mexican food, except what I ordered was possibly the leanest dish on the menu. D'oh! Bad ordering on my part. The sad thing was, I actually wasn't trying to be healthy this time. I guess the really greasy cheese and beans covered Mexican food just doesn't appeal to me.  My friend got a combination plate that had chili rellenos, tacos, fried something else, beans, and rice that looked like a heart attack waiting to happen. He had me taste the chili rellenos, which was good, but I don't think I could've eaten a whole plate of that. I got a carne asada beef sautéed with onions, peppers, tomatoes and spices. It was quite bland and indeed very lean. When I ordered it, the server said it was her favorite dish. In hindsight, I never should've taken that as a good sign, cuz she's skinny as a stick and probably doesn't eat half of the time!   Sigh...usually I'm so good about ordering the most delicious item on the menu. This was a pretty big fail. Thankfully I had a few more days in Arizona and was able to redeem myself and get some good, authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"This place sucks!! The staff (specifically Laura) was indifferent towards the customers and the food was not good. They ripped me off on price and it was a terrible experience. I highly suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"this place is ridiculous. ive had pretty mediocre food from here a few times, but its down the street from my house so i think i just keep hoping it will get better. The Carne Asada is totally bland. And their quesadillas are practically inedible. The one good thing is their salsa and bean dip.  So I just called to place a take out order for a side of bean dip. The woman informed me that chips do NOT come with the bean dip and it would be $1.99 extra for them (Do most people eat bean dip WITHOUT chips?). Ok. Fine. I will pay the $1.99. Then i ask if salsa is included with the cost of chips, to which she replies no, salsa is extra as well. I hung up. Everything they were trying to charge me for is FREE if i was going to sit there and eat my bean dip!   I think i have finally given up on this place just go to cheba hut next door ;)"}
{"text":"My family and I love coming to Rosita's. I like most everything here. I am not spelling it right but i love the machaka burritos and tacos. Chips and salsa are the best. The only thing i stay clear of (and this is at all Mexican food restaurant's not just Rosita's)  is the shredded chicken because it tastes boiled and bland. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the yelp haters, this place is fantastic....good food great service...the  bartender Nessy is wonderful and deserves a raise! Can't beat the chips and salsa and happy hour prices!! Been coming here weekly since first finding out about this place. Do yourself a favor and get over there!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Top notch Mexican fare. The restaurant has been around for ages, and it looks dated, but clean. I very much enjoyed my stop in this place for lunch. I'd go back when I get the hankering for Mexican while in Chandler/Mesa."}
{"text":"I come here often. The prices and food quality are great.  Appetizers are half off during happy hour."}
{"text":"Not really sure where to begin so I will start at the beginning. The hostess took our drink order but I only had water. And sadly, that was the best part of the meal. The waitress had the personality of a wet noodle with no smile, short answers, and not friendly at all. She wasn't unfriendly, just like I said...a wet noodle.   The chips and \"salsa\" came. We tried the hot, but the waitress was right in calling it smooth. It was blended, had little flavor, and was literally and figuratively cold. As if it was in a fridge. The regular salsa had little flavor as well.  Then came the menu which was set up nice until I saw the prices and the size. The prices were easily half again as most places with portions half the size of the better and cheaper restaurants.   We got a \"bean and jalapeño\" dip that had no flavor whatsoever. We mixed in the \"hot\" sauce in an attempt to salvage it. It got a little better.   So I ordered my usual go to at a new Mexican restaurant. Flautas with refried beans and rice. The rice was ok. The beans actually had good flavor, but the tiny little flautas were bad to the point of I just stopped eating anything all together.   Then on top, they over charged me!   This place was a disappointment and not worth your time and money. I would have done better with a bean and cheese burrito at a shady gas station! I suggest doing your pallet a favor and keep going down the road..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Arizona style Mexican joints. Their chips are always hot and fresh made. Their salsa is nice and spicy. The red is a little smoky. The green is hot and flavorful. Their guac, if you order it, is fresh made and tasty.They have a few stand out items on the menu.  Albondingas Soup - mexican meatball soup. It's about $5, huge, comes with a plate of refried beans and warm tortillas, your choice of corn or flour. (Corn, bishes!#@) Delicious, filling, and relatively healthy.   Tamales. I love their green corn tamales. They have green sauce on them and some hot chile inside. Yum!  Short ribs. Yup. Grilled and very meaty. Delicious.  Enchiladas. Perfect.  If you like menudo, you can order it with or without the hoof. I don't like medudo or hooves, so you're on your own, but it seems popular with patrons who have that inverse make a run for the border vibe.  The reviewers who panned this place must have smoked crack before visiting. Or filed the wrong report at the wrong place. They can't be talking about Rositas!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I only came a 2nd time because I wanted to give it a second chance. I should've just stayed home and gotten Filibertos. First off its so unorganized with the 6 people they have at the host stand. You don't know who do go to to be seated. We decided to sit in the lounge. I'm not a fan of ANY restaurants with carpet, but this carpet looks 20 years old and dingy. Besides that I still wanted to eat here because I like authentic Mexican food. The only person taking the entire lounge area is this older man who is very impatient. His huffs and has attitude when you have questions. I accepted it's because he was the only person taking an entire room of people and it wasn't his fault, but then again why was he the only person in that section. The bartender server also told us that everything on the drink menu is different and that it was an old menu so not everything would be available. Time for updated drink menus. All in all the food was ok, Chips and salsa were good. 3rd time won't be the charm for me because I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was alright. I got a vibe of not very clean. The staff appeared to not be so well groomed. Not very nice but it makes me wonder how things are in the kitchen and never mind bathroom. I won't be back. Correction ~ 2 of the staff that handled our food were not well groomed. The others were fine~ but it made me nervous for what we were eating."}
{"text":"As I was eating a delicious mini-combo plate (chips and salsa, 4 items, rice, beans, sour cream & guacamole)  before the game Saturday night I thought I should tell others just how good the food is at this place.   I wouldn't want any Mexican food  aficionados to  miss out.    Rosita's has been our favorite for 25 years.  I remember our first visit and we saw some popular local sports figures there enjoying the fare.  The chips and salsa are the best and the drink glasses huge.   Nobody deep fries a chimi better, hot, crisp yet a bit flakey.  How do they do that?  And unlike other places, the green corn tamale is moist  and tasty and has some cheese on top...  perfect.   My wife likes the spinach enchiladas which are topped off with a white melted cheese, just great.   I go for the red beef tamale, tacos and enchiladas. What I'm impressed with is each individual item I've had at Rosita's is seasoned to perfection and a delight to the taste buds.    The place has been around a long time and shows its age somewhat.   It's not pricey and not cheap, but the food is the best."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. I had the enchilada special and that was delicious. The table I sat at was clean. The waitress and waiter were very nice. The food came out quickly. I brought my wife and mother in law for lunch. Me and my wife had been wanting to come here and we are glad we did."}
{"text":"Great Mexican good.  Love their happy hour prices.  Excellent service from Flow.  Had a wonderful personality and was very attentive to our needs. Food was amazing. Prices are still great. You get plenty to eat.  Yum. Yum."}
{"text":"Rosita's was a real disappointment. I was craving a hard shell taco with rice and beans for lunch and gave Rosita's a shot at satisfying my hunger. I chose wrong.  The chips and salsa were okay, not great. The salsa was a pretty watered down and didn't have a lot of flavor. The chips were warm, like they promise, but tasted like they'd been sitting under the warmer a little too long.  I went with the burrito and taco lunch special; everything I was craving. I chose a chicken burrito and machaca taco. It was sorely disappointing. The taco was okay, but didn't have a lot of flavor; the burrito was horrible.   A thick, store-bought quality flour tortilla filled with flavorless, boiled chicken and absolutely nothing else. I had to cut open the tortilla and douse the atrocity that lay inside with the remaining rice and beans on my plate and a large helping of salsa just to make this thing palatable.  Whether Mexican, Italian, Thai or American, really good food is all about flavor. Unfortunately, Rosita's had none to offer."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! Used to be the best, but after new owners took over, it has slipped a little! Great salsa, and spinach enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Another Delicious Lunch!   This time I went all out and ordered a Carnitas Chimichanga Enchilada Style (see pics)  Wow! The Pork was so juicy, tender and flavorful it wasn't greasy at all this was such an indulgent thing to eat with all the cheese and sour cream and sauce etc. The only thing I didn't like was the guacamole because it was too spicy for me other than that it perfect to the last bite, Yes I ate it all! OINK!!   The Hubs got his usual Stacked Enchiladas with a fried egg on top.(see pics)  This time the enchiladas were served in a little crock which made the edge of the tortilla crisp but other than that he loved them once again.   Rositas will be the perfect place to pick up some food for a \"potluck\"  I'm going to take advantage of their catering menu since I've got a party to attend next month.  If you're ever in the area don't be scared, just go in and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"I've had a mixed experience at Rosita's. The first time I came, I ordered their signature dish with chicken, that came absoutely swimming in melted cheese. I should've known, as Lauren V. noted, Rostia's serves Arizona-style Mexican food for the most part, which means uber helpings of cheese and sauce.  Wiser the second time I went, I ignored my waiter's advice to order another dish that seemed to be also a prime candidate for cheese drowning, and went for the fish tacos, which were quite good and served with a heaping portion of rice and beans.  I should also give props to the salsa, which was somewhat spicy but comes with extra hot sauce to add to one's own pleasure. While this seems common out in Arizona, it's a tradition that should make its way east, for sure.   I guess it all depends what you're looking for. Most of the dishes here seem to be in the \"cover with as much cheese and sauce as possible\" category. If that's your bag, then you're set. I, on the other hand, feel I need to choose very carefully here."}
{"text":"i like rosita's- especially their salsa. the food is average mexican- the chile relleno platter is good and their shredded beef is the best bet. the service is good but like i said- it's just average"}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has such low ratings. We got food catered for work and since I'm not from here I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised to have a very authentic authentic tasting chimichanga. Large flour tortilla stuffed with shredded beef and deep-fried then covered in enchilada sauce and more cheese. I really like the factthat they include sour cream, guacamole, salsa and chips for each lunch order."}
{"text":"five of us from the office went out to celebrate a new client contract and Rosita's is close to the office - the margarita's were good, the service was good, the food was good, and the chips and salsa were good.  the shredded beef chimichanga I had was as good as Macayo's, where the price is 25% higher. the enchilada sauce could have been Kroger's brand - the salsa made up for it.  my friend gave me a bite of her tamale and it was very good.  - So, basically, ya pays ya money and ya takes ya chances"}
{"text":"I had a tamale combo here with a friend. It was okay, I've had much better for around $12. The tamale was kind of \"fluffy,\" there was hardly any meat inside. Beans were very standard, chips and salsa were okay. The water was absolutely horrible though. It tasted like how sewage would taste.  I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I was a little iffy about eating here because of the reviews, but I think for the low prices, the food ins't bad. We had the lunch specials. I had a cheese enchilada with white sauce on top with rice. The rice was good and the white cheese sauce was tasty. My husband had a chicken enchilada with green sauce and he liked his meal okay. The inside is really outdated. But if you're looking for a lunch spot that isn't drive thru, this place will do the trick."}
{"text":"Since moving to Arizona, I've found an appreciation for mexican food (except for beans... I dont know why, but I just can't get into them). We went to Rosita's on a double-date- my boyfriend and the other couple used to go there a lot \"back in the day\" and they all love it. I guess I just don't fit into the mold.   The chips were average... the salsa too- not very spicy and a little watered down even. I ordered a combo plate, trying a beef enchilada and a chicken taco. Both were average... nothing to write home about. Equivalent to Filberto's for about 3x the cost.   The atmosphere was not my favorite... lots of families there at 8pm... with lots of screaming kids. Why did each adult couple have 7 kids with them???   My favorite part of Rositas = their huge glasses of pop. I only needed one refill of my diet coke :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything Ive tried on the menu is great.  Cant beat their happy hour, mmm margaritas.....  While I agree w/ Tiffany that calling it \"fine food\" is a stretch, its definately authentic, and filling."}
{"text":"I used to love this place before they changed their menu.  They use to have this awesome chimichanga, which was filled with peppers, spicey pork and lots of other goodies.  I always got it with the white cheese sauce.  Let me tell you, this chimichanga was DA Bomb!!  However, for some reason, they took it off the menu!!  Ugh!! The food is still pretty good though, but I miss that chimichanga more than you know!  In fact, let's have a moment of silence, please!  :)"}
{"text":"After 20 years, I am DONE with Rositas. The quality of service and food is not what it used to be. Staff turnover is high. Management does not seem to care. So sad but I am not going back any more."}
{"text":"Rosita's is pretty average. I probably stop in once a year, I stopped in the other week on the way to Gammage to catch 9 to 5.   There is nothing outstanding about this place, but nothing to terrible either.   the chips and salsa are always good and plentiful, but they are just ships and salsa, its hard to mess them up.   I always get the same thing, a green corn tamale and a shredded beef taco. I like them.   The service is hit and miss. Last week was horrendous. Our waitress was no where to be found, never checked on us to see if the food was ok or if we needed anything and we waited for ever to get the bill and had to flag her down to have her take our payment.   When I go here I don't ever have high expectations, so I am generally not let down."}
{"text":"Third time having it and it has been spot on every time. Quesadillas chimichanga tortes. I mean even the rice and beans."}
{"text":"We have tried many mexican food here in the valley. This is probably the best we liked.  The salsa just tastes fresh. They said they make it everyday and we go there every month just to taste that salsa. Spinach Enchilada on stack with white sauce hasn't tasted better anywhere else (even in El Paso !).. same goes with Chicken Enchilada with red sauce. We love the Flan to end it..Awesome food every time you go.. Very friendly staff. I am writing this review after about 20 visits in the last two years with the family. The quality hasn't changed at all.. Good one.."}
{"text":"Went here last night!  Was pleasantly surprised.  Walking in, my first thought was to turn around and walk out.  Hot and muggy inside- but I am so glad that we stayed.  The food was really good.  Like- really good.  I do not like guacamole- so I don't care what they do to it- but the consensus from my group was that it was no bueno.  Everything else- 2 thumbs up.  Margaritas were good- could have been a little stronger.  Prickly pear was the best.  Salsa's were delish- wish the \"hot\" was a little spicier.  Overall, the food was great and price was even better!  Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to this place? I used to come here often when I worked close by and the food was always good. This time around, it was lackluster at best. The place looked dirty, dingy. This place looks like it's on life support. It's a shame too, really liked this place before. I hope it pulls through and the owners really step it up."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant! We come here almost weekly. Salsa is amazing, chips are amazing,staff is amazing, food is amazing, and the pina colada's are the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing! Riley was our waitress and she was so sweet and helpful! Emily the manager (assuming) is also really great and professional. They made a minor mistake and charges us less! So generous we did not expect that. On top of it all, food was amazing! Street tacos were so great the beef was outstanding! My mom wanted hotter salsa and Emily made their regular salsa hotter with a yummy spice and brought my mom the spice to make it her own if she wanted! Prices were amazing, food was amazing, service outstanding. Definitely our new favorite AUTHENTIC Mexican place!"}
{"text":"I have since returned to Rosita's after my bad/mediocre experience and it seems to be just fine.  Just fine as in it would be amazing if located in a northern state, but here in Arizona where delicious Mexican food is plentiful, it doesn't stand out.    I appreciate that they offer two types of beans rather than just the standard refried variety.  The service and food have been fine lately."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. My wife and I both had chimmi's enchilada style but they didn't deep fry them so they where really enchilada burritos. My black beans where also under cooked."}
{"text":"Food was great, we tried a few different things on the pick 8 mini sampler platter. The prices were a little higher than expected, but the food was worth it. Also, $3 margaritas on Monday!"}
{"text":"A throwback to nostalgic 80's mexican cuisine. Don't let the dated decor fool or mislead you- Rosita's serves great food at affordable prices. Lunch specials are great. Our server was friendly, service was snappy, and the little kids menu was full of options ($0.99 for cheese enchilada rice & beans!). Overall a great experience, come and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Our meal started out great with tasty margaritas and above-average nachos. The real downfall was the chicken tostada, which was made with canned chicken!  Seriously, neither of us could eat it.   To add insult to injury, our waiter totally forgot about us so it took 45 minutes to get the check. At least they told the lousy tostada off the check!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the white dip. It's amazing. Try t on the chimichanga, enchilada or burrito. Amazing! Service can be a bit slow depending on the time you go and the server you have. One of our go-to's for good Mexican food"}
{"text":"I have to concur on the weird smell... a little like sewage. Definitely not good for the appetite.   I liked the friendly service, but while the food was cheap and edible, it was nothing special. The salsa is indeed pretty good, but not so amazing  that it's worth coming here instead of going somewhere with better food. I had a prickly pear margarita that had a nice flavor, but was way too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but the prices seemed a little high for the area. Try the fried ice cream - it has sunflower seeds!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican Food.  I love their tamales, tacos, and enchiladas.  Their cheese crisp is a good appetizer.  Their menu is impressive, with a wide range of things to choose.  If you have nothing else, however, make sure you have a serving of their deep fried ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years! It's right down the street from my house. Their spinach enchiladas are the best! Ask for Jordan! He kicks ass and is alway attentive!"}
{"text":"This place has been here forever. and it hasn't changed at all it seems. It wouldn't really be THAT bad if it wasn't for the fact that EVERY damned thing you order is oversalted to the point of insanity. It's crazy! And my girlfriend is a salt fiend....she really loves it! But even she couldn't stomach that much oversalting. It seems to be the only trick the kitchen knows! And you can see the evidence on every table...completely full salt shakers, that likely never need refilling. A person would have to be mad to actually add additional salt to their food here. There are much better Mexican food places around- try Susie's Mexican cafe, up the street on University."}
{"text":"Seemed like we were going to have a Wonderful dinner, comfortable seating, hostess and waiter very attentive, chips & salsa medium hot pretty good so far.  Then it ended right there we (3) of us had something different for dinner WE ALL complained to eachother about the same thing...........bland, bland no real flavor and definitely no mexican flavor at all.  Rice very very bland as well as the beans.  Tamale flavorless, dry and beef well (definitely frozen).  The ONLY thing I can say was \"good cheesecrisp\" !!  1st time & last to try this 54 yr family owned restaurant...........the recipes definitely got lost somewhere???????????"}
{"text":"They have a huge menu that is VERY original. I HIGHLY recomend the Mexican Pizza for an apitizer, the Shirmp Fajitas, and also the CHICKen Mole is To die for!"}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland. I had thought that there was no place more gringo than Matas. I was wrong.  Continuation: As I was paying my bill, the woman at the register asked how I liked my lunch. I was honest and told her it wasn't my favorite. The food had been very bland. (I ate less than half of the small tostada I had ordered.) She said that she was sorry that I hadn't liked my meal. I told her not to worry too much about it, I just wanted to pay and be on my way. She returned my money and said that she wouldn't charge me for a meal I hadn't enjoyed. I appreciate her doing that. I left a tip for my server and was gone. It's sad because this used to be one of our go to places. My husband and I were there for this location's grand opening some 30 years ago. (The cook quit on opening night and it took forever for the food to come to the table.) Sadly, I was reminded today of why we stopped eating there."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant. Fast, good chips and salsa. Staff is nice. I've been going here since I was a child, they give kids coloring pages and crayons and have been doing it for years!"}
{"text":"As my friend from high school likes to say, \"this is my second favorite place to go eat.\"  The first, of course, is Someburros.  Oh Rositas, how I miss thee For in Cleveland, the land is bereft of good Mexican food (and NO, Chipotle doesn't count) Eating here brings back good memories of times spent with friends Ordering chicken mole, enchiladas HUGE glasses of refreshing horchata!  I revisited Rositas a few days ago As good as I remember it to be Green corn tamale and spinach enchilada Although I've had tasty enchiladas here before, The flavors for me didn't quite taste right. Green corn tamale was delicious though.  So, not perfect food, but really close!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Rosita's for years, and have generally been pretty satisfied with their meals here.  Portions are good, and even their \"lighter\" size burrito is still big enough to make me full."}
{"text":"I visited Rosita's today for lunch with a group of coworkers. A couple of my friends had previously visited, but this was my first experience. We chose Rosita's because of a promo coupon today which donated 15% of the total bill to a local animal shelter.  Previous reviews described poor service; however, our service today was about average for a busy lunch timeslot. I ordered the two item combo with rice & beans. I chose the shredded beef taco and the green corn tamale. Good flavor on the tamale, nice crunchy hard taco."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I haven't reviewed Rosita's yet!  This is always our go to for authentic Mexican food that doesn't disappoint. I love the chicken flautas or regular chicken tacos. Kids love the cheese enchiladas. And apparently they make their red chile with beef fresh daily with a wonderful recipe that is favorite of my husband's and the server's.  The chips and salsa are full of flavor, especially when you mix in some of the hot sauce.  The only thing I can think of that I don't like is the water... It's tap and tastes terrible. Thankfully they have Pepsi products and gigantic cups to feed my Mt Dew addiction."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of co-workers for lunch who don't seem the adventurous type, though everybody always says they are.  It's a pretty standard Mexican food restaurant that you can find just about anywhere.  There is nothing standout about the menu, other than the fact they call their burritos \"burros\" which we were all pretty sure meant donkey.  You get the standard chips and salsa.  There is a big lunch menu with lots of options.  They charge for just about anything extra.  The server was good and made sure to take care of us before he got to a very large group so we wouldn't have to wait.  I wouldn't not come back here; but there are so many options that I wouldn't necessarily seek out this place either."}
{"text":"The hostess that sits you and cashes you out was less than friendly. The bathrooms are disgusting. We ordered the mini appetizers and the tacos were really good. Chips and hot sauce were good as usual but chips weren't hot. Our waitress was attentive and courteous. Shredded chicken quesadilla was really good. Guacamole is gross and blended with no chunks. Should have a bigger variety of coloring sheets for the kids. They did give my baby a fresh balloon. FYI I've been dining here for thirty years and this place is nothing like it used to be when mama rosita was alive. I bet she's rolling over in her grave as she's witnessing the demise of her empire. I Still come here out of habit. Bring back the chip station and boiling hot plates of food. Portion size has also decreased significantly."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this place for the first time a few weeks ago.  I want to say from the start that in the interest of fairness the service was great, the place is attractive, and (since I know this place has been around forever) it must appeal to a certain clientele who like this middle-of-the-road type of Senoran food.  And 3 stars means A-OK according to Yelp.  So the flavors here work if you are in a pinch, but there is nothing that really wowed us.  Have you ever ordered a cheese crisp and wondered why there was so little cheese on it?  Have you ever dipped your chip in a salsa and thought, \"I could probably chop up a better salsa than that\"?  Nothing was bad, but our combination plates contained nothing that would bring us back craving something.  Taste is subjective, and it's a comfortable hang and the servers are attentive, but if you know, it all comes down to recipes, and we found the flavors merely adequate but not fantastic."}
{"text":"We've been here a bunch but I feel like it's a little bit overpriced and most recently found a big long black hair in the hot sauce. The server apologized and said the manager would come over but he never did.  It's like they could care less about their customers.  I'm sticking with Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale for the best ever tacos!"}
{"text":"Rosita's has been my go to Mexican food place since I got here three years ago. The staff are very friendly, they have amazing chips and salsa and really good queso dip! If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I remember trying Rosita's a long time ago and being pretty disappointed after a number of my friends had hyped it up pretty heavily...so today, as my co-worker and I debated over which Mexican place to try, I decided to give Rosita's another opportunity to win me over. For starters, the chips and salsa were pretty average. The chips were a little thicker than I prefer, and the salsa (at least in my opinion) tasted like a thin tomato base mixed with water. Very little spice, and not much taste at all. I ordered a shredded beef burro and a chicken taco combo plate because it was one of the best deals on the menu at $7.50, and I enjoyed the shredded beef...perhaps a bit dry, but it still had a decent flavor to it. The chicken, however, gave me flashbacks to my bad experience at Manuel's...although not quite as awful, it was very bland and lacked any real redeeming qualities. I still don't get how a place can f-up chicken! Jeeez. The spanish rice I had on the side was pretty standard, but all in all this was another pretty \"bleh\" dining experience. My dining companion just sent me an email to inform me that his bean burrito was already trying to make a comeback, I'm just glad I went double rice verus rice and beans. I give it two stars because we had a good waitress who was fairly attentive and because the shredded beef was passable."}
{"text":"Rosita's is better than Macayo's (that's not saying much), less commercial and more traditional AZ mex.. It is decent, but they over-cheese everything. Their food tends to be a bit greasy and overpriced, however the salsa is excellent. The menu is humongous and they cater which is nice when you forget it's mexican potluck day at work :) The service has always been fast, friendly and very attentive.  I'm knocking it down to 2 stars because on last two visits the sewer smell (remember that smell from Long Wong's..) permeated the entire restaurant and I just about lost my appetite (which is not good when you are paying $8.95 for a freaking burrito)."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for spring training and Rosita's was suggested by our hotel.  This was our first visit and will be our last.  I should have known something wasn't right by the smell that overwhelmed us when we walked in the door. Something must have died, it was terrible.  We waited then waited while the hostess had her back to us while taking a phone order.  She was so surprised when she turn around to see us and 3 other groups waiting to be seated.  We were seated in the bar area and met by a pleasant waiter who clearly was overwhelmed.  My margarita was delicious wish I had another but after delivering our order we never saw our busy waiter again.  I had the green tamale, and it was very good.  Unfortunately, that tamale wasn't good enough to overcome the negatives."}
{"text":"this is very bland, Americanized Mexican food. I had the stacked enchiladas, with fideo as a side.... i gotta say the fideo was REALLY good, but.. well. it's hard to mess up fideo!  Otherwise, the salsa tastes like raw tomato sauce, the enchiladas were far less than spectacular, and the guacamole we ordered was similar to what could be had at any grocery store. There are so many more exciting, fresher tasting, less expensive Mexican eateries in the area, so I don't have any plans on returning to Rosita's."}
{"text":"Horrible!! My food, which was beef, tasted like mold & seafood!! I couldn't finish and I'll never come back!! On top of that, the place was filthy! GROSS.GROSS.GROSS!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Staff is very friendly. Most of the food is delicious. I personally am not a fan of their guacamole. This is my second visit. Both times we had to ask for silverware."}
{"text":"This was my first \"Mexican\" restaurant after I moved here. Eh, it was OK. I was expecting more. Considering that when you're from Pittsburgh, the closest thing to Mexican is Taco Bell. Ha. I went with the safe bet, Carne Asada, which I'd never heard of, but sounded good . It was good but, not enough to bring me back. Besides, I like the risk factor of Fili-Bs :D"}
{"text":"Still our favorite. Food is always excellent. Service is always great. It is a pleasant place to be. Portions are large. Get the chili reyeno with red enchilada sauce and carne Picasa."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I hold very close to heart. I grew up eating here and anytime I come back to the valley it's a must stop. Today was that day and I can only say it's as good as it ever was.  Old school, Arizona style mexican cuisine at its finest.  Thank you Rosita's for staying true to your roots and never compromising your quality.  5 stars isn't enough but all I can give."}
{"text":"Rosita's is pretty standard Mexican fare, but that makes it none-the-less delicious! They have fair lunchtime specials and great tortilla chips to compliment your meal. Highly recommended if looking for some no-nonsense, simple and straight-forward-delicious Mexican!   Keep singing,  -Jerron"}
{"text":"We decided to give Rosita's a second chance and I'm glad we did!    The chips and salsa are excellent here.   I ordered the Monday night special - chicken fajitas burro and it was delicious. Much better than anything I've ever ordered in the past. It came with rice and beans that were.....fine. The rice could use some help.  One person in our party ordered the green corn tamales - she did not care for them. My husband said the fajitas beef burro was good. My daughter inhaled her kid's grande plate that was fill of mini tacos, tostada, rolled tacos, etc.  My son ordered the beef chimi. He said it was good, but soggy.   I definitely agree with other reviewers - this place needs a major face lift and deep cleaning. The restrooms are a disaster.   Very casual atmosphere. The service was fine, but not great.  Nothing to compliment but nothing do big as to complain."}
{"text":"Pretty good homestyle Tex-Mex.  The salsa is outstanding.  Just don't go here for lunch unless you are able to take a nap afterwards."}
{"text":"I have lived here since 1984 and this was the first place I ever ate in Arizona as a 5 year old. I keep coming back for more over and over again. I crave it constantly! I get the simple cheese enchilada with rice and beans and it's super hot on a hot plate every time and still tastes the same after all these years. Best salsa/chips you will every have as well. Massive drinks is always a bonus. Not giving it 5 stars due to the inside not have been touched in probably 30 years. Needs to be updated a tad, but other than that...food wise, it's my favorite mexican food in AZ. :)"}
{"text":"It was decent, it states fine dining and no it was not... It was mediocre at best. I will say I liked the music and some- some of the staff was quite genuine.  Will I return? no- but I didn't regret it."}
{"text":"Welp, let's start off with the name Fine Dining, definitely not a \"fine dining\" establishment. I understand some places shoot for the whole run down old fashion type look but this placed just looked like it legitimately need a renovation.   I ordered a carnitas burrito $9.25. Figured at that price it would come with sides and/or a fat girthy burrito. When he asked if I'd like to make it a platter for an extra $3.50 I immediately became deflated. \"Well what's the platter come with?\" I ask. He said rice and beans. Cool, but no thanks on paying extra for the poverty sides. I love margaritas so I decided to indulge. $9.75 later I received a delicious, sweet, mediocre sized margarita with the smallest amount of salt on the rim. This place has nothing on El Zocolo in downtown chandler for their margaritas. No problem paying $10 there for one. The beautiful woman I was with had order a beer but unfortunately he brought the wrong one and he sure had no problem making her feel like it was her fault for ordering the wrong beer. Which she didn't. Dude just needed to listen better. Whatever. Food came out extremely quick, soon enough I'd realize why. I receive my burrito with chopped lettuce and that's it. This little guy had an undercooked tortilla and not very much carnitas. That's it. $9.25 for a tortilla and meat. Awesome. If you want a great burrito go to Los Favoritos and it won't cost you $10. The best part of this dining experience was that we didn't have to pay for the stale chips. Salsa was great tho!!!!  One simple burrito, four small street tacos, one beer and one margarita... $37. I'll let you decide if that sounds worth coming here. Mexican food ain't fancy food. Keep it simple and prices affordable.  Suuuuuper disappointed guys. Come on. At least we know this is not a place for our fancy fine dining exquisite taste in what we think Mexican food should be. Didn't really think it was that easy to mess up a Mexican food dining experience.  NOOOO GRACIAS!!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for three years. Walked in and was told that there is a 10-minute wait to be sat at the bar when I can see a dozen seats open. Maybe I won't go here again. Time to invest in some staff?"}
{"text":"Terrible, this is just about the worst Mexican I've had in AZ. And that includes Taco Bell. Granted, standards for anything Latin are pretty high in Phoenix, but I couldn't imagine people would enjoy this place no matter where they're from. My company orders lunch here from time to time, so I'm forced to eat it or *gasp* pay for my own lunch. Yet this is the one place we order from that I actually consider sitting out for. The portions are tiny, it's kinda expensive and the small amount of food you do get is bland and gross. There are so many good Mexican restaurants in the Valley, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the service is soooooo bad on a consistent basis. The worst part about it is that they don't give a flip. It's close to my house and convenient,  only reason I occasionally come here.  I would definitely NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a week ago and was definitely satisfied! The steak tacos were very yummy, as were their salsas."}
{"text":"this place is the best!! been going for years and enjoy it every time. they have the best salsa ever, good hot sauce and omg the shredded beef, especially in the tacos, is so awesome. refried beans and rice are also so good. try a shredded beef item, the enchiladas, the cheese crisp or stacked enchiladas, just really good. I don't even know what they do differently to the cheese crisp, but man is it good! Don't expect a new age, \"healthier\" Mexican American food place; expect good, standard AZ-style Mexican food that's easy to crave.  the staff is usually friendly, but of course sometimes you get someone a bit cranky (won't say her name). however, overall it is a very laid back, comfortable place to be, with generally friendly employees. yes, the environment is dated, and not the epitome of \"fine dining\", but they have been around for years. You can order a drink from the bar to your table or sit in the bar area. They make a great Roy Rogers (Cola and cherry grenadine) and the sasparilla is also good. you can't go wrong with a rositas shredded beef taco and salsa n chips; even on their worst day. so give them a try!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place and it was worth the wait! Service was too notch they are very attentive and friendly! The food was absolutely wonderful! I cannot wait to come back and bring my family and friends when they visit"}
{"text":"We eat there once a week. Chips and salsa is the best."}
{"text":"This is a family run Mexican restaurant in Tempe. We were there for lunch and the place was packed. We did not have to wait for a table, but the place was hopping. Our server greeted us very quickly and took our drink order. She returned with chips and salsa along with our drinks. My wife got the enchilada, which came with refried beans, rice and lettuce and tomato. I ordered two soft chicken tacos, which came with black beans, rice and lettuce and tomato also. Everything was fresh and seemed to be home made. The flavor for both of our meals was nothing short of outstanding. The amount of food you got was very generous. If you are looking for the REAL Mexican experience, Rosita's is your place. With Momma Rosita's picture on the menu, you know this has to be authentic."}
{"text":"We dined here on January 20th, 2018, and was not disappointed.  We sat in the dining area instead of the lounge. (Quieter)  Service is prompt. We started with quesadillas , these are huge, and delicious. Keep in Mind , you get fresh chips and salsa too.  For drinks we ordered a Mango Margarita and a Cadillac Margarita(recommended) both were refreshing.  Mango was sweet , but just the right amount of sweet, the Cadillac had a nice bite to it. Then our food came out just as we finished our quesadillas.  The samplers are either 4 or 8 mini sized  options of their bigger items , for example I had flauta, tostada, relleno,  and a beef chimi, served with beans and rice. It was fantastic! The server we had kept coming by and checking on us!  The resturant is dated , but that doesn't affect the foods taste ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've been there multiple times and ordered many different when you items, they were all awesome. I particularly loved the burritos and the pollo con arroz. When you go, you have to try the pan de leche dessert - so good. Drinks are very large cups, and even if you manage to drink the whole thing, servers are attentive and quick to refill. Food always comes in a reasonable amount of time and right when you sit down a server is at the table with a large free fresh basket of chips, fresh pico salsa and hot salsa. The Horchata is wonderful, the food is wonderful, the margaritas are great, and the happy hour is such a good price... regular prices are also pretty awesome for this area of town. If you want some great authentic Mexican food, go to Rositas!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites for salsa and excellent Margaritas!"}
{"text":"I come here on occasion, usually with coworkers for lunch during the week.  I have always enjoyed the food here.  The lunch specials are great and the chips and salsa are always plentiful and warm.  I will definitely return when in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Accidently found this little gem, after an afternoon of shopping. Went in, there was a line waiting to get in, ok, this could be good.  Smelled wonderful! It could be updated, but it was clean. I would like the music to be softer, so that we could talk without letting the other customers in on our conversation. The food was amazing!  My friend ordered a lightly fried chimi, she devoured it. I wanted a Shrimp Taco Salad, not on the menu, but they did it for me anyway...Thank you Seth for a great evening."}
{"text":"The only redeeming thing about Rositas is the free chips and salsa.  I grew up coming here all the time but my family switched to a different Mexican restaurant due to the mediocre food served here.  If I am craving salsa I stop in for happy hour and order a cheese crisp and eat it with refried beans and tons of salsa."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this establishment, and normally, when I write a review, I usually wait until my second visit.  But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was not over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.  I think it's better than Serrano's.  The decor is mediocre, at best, but they make up for it in the food."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic cuisine.  We live bed the table side guacamole and fajitas were great.  Our waitress Vanessa was superb"}
{"text":"Finally stopped by this place after a year of living right by it was actually way better than i thought it would( yes I judged) Lots of seating and the bar area has nice big comfy booths also. Service was very good and food came out quickly. They have a HUGE menu and not too expensive either. Everything was really good, we had a crap load of leftovers. Chips and salsa were also good as well :) Will have to go by for a second time to see if I can bump up my star rating. I'm just not a huge Mexican food fan so i am pretty hard to please in this area of food so go and try it out for yourself cause it def is not a bad place!"}
{"text":"This place is good for local and fast Mexican food. Better than Macayo's or Filiberto's. The atmosphere is relaxing and I like that they have daily specials. There is an interesting story behind Rosita's. Mama Rosa opened the first restaurant in the 60s and it was very small with only four tables. Now it's much bigger and they still use her recipes. Yum! Now I want a chimichanga."}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Rosita's for 14 years and we keep going back. It's authentic and spicy. Great salsa and many choices. I usually get #37 (taco, enchilada and tostada). I recommend trying Rosita's if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I consider three stars a safe visit. Some people loved it, some people hated it. That's life!   It was a average restaurant. The chicken enchiladas were  OK. They didn't have a lot of taste. I didn't really like the beef tamale. It was too thick and lacked taste. The margarita was drinkable. I agree with the Yelpers...The salsa was DELICIOUS! You can't mess up rice and beans. My partner said that his chimichanga was OK.  If I lived in Tempe and lived close to there, I would probably go back. As a visitor, I won't go out of my way to go there during any visits to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place looks very dirty. I don't know if it is, but I didn't feel very comfortable eating there. I did eat there, though, and the food was pretty mediocre. Nothing had much flavor or spice. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Two words - beef chimichanga. I love chiimis and theirs is hands down one of the best in the valley.   Overall, Rosita's is a pretty average Mexican restaurant. Calling it \"fine food\" may be a bit of a stretch. I love their chips and salsa and their black beans along with the chimi. Steer clear of the \"guacamole\". I don't think it includes a single avocado. It's more of a green sour cream.  We affectionately refer to it as \"the creepy green sauce\". The service is usually fast and always friendly which makes it a great place for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent chips, salsa, and cold beer! Service is friendly and efficient too.   PROS: chips are homemade, light and crispy, and not too oily as some restaurants tend to serve. Love their salsa, as it is just the right amount of spicy and not too chunky.   I had a carne asada chimichanga that was superb: fresh oil used to fry the chimi, and the meat was plentiful and tasty!  Throw in a textbook cheese crisp and a $2.50 pint (maybe 3) of cold Dos Equis, and life is good!  CONS: Jury is out on the guacamole: I'd describe it as creamy, not chunky. This left me a little skeptical, as I like to know there is fresh avocado involved.    I'm a fan of Rosita's. Service w/ a smile, and they've got the basics down!  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"I love this place for Mexican food and have been going here for the past 7 or 8 years.  The service is always great whether you're with a large group or alone at the bar and the food is always great and served hot.   If you're looking at drinks you have to try the prickly pear margaritas... Seriously. Now understand that I love prickly pear anything which is surprisingly hard to find out here, but this place has got the best ones. I mean it... With sugar on the rocks, please.   This particular visit I ended up ordering the 2 item combo with a chicken enchilada and a tostada, which is pretty much my usual here. I enjoyed the chips and salsa while I waited for the food to come out, however this time they gave me both the regular chunky 'mild-ish' salsa along with the hotter stuff, guess they're starting to know me. If you like hot salsas be sure to ask for this, because they usually only serve the regular unless asked.    Anyways, the food came out promptly and was exactly how I like it.  The tostada was crisp and the enchilada was full of yummy chicken (they don't skimp on the chicken or add weird fillers here).  All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone over one of the larger chains any day. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Rositas used to be my favorite family restaurant.  Sadly, this location has gone downhill  due to current manager.  Despite being longtime customer-and I mean 50 years between Tempe and Mesa, the manager is very rude.  He does not care about customer service.  Gave me two small containers of hot sauce for 4 takeout dinners and said needed to charge if I wanted more.  Would not honor frequent diner card for item that cost less.  Do yourself a favor and drive to Tempe Rositas or go somewhere else.  Wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Rosita's. Everything is really cheesed up, a lot of it is greasy, and the've expanded their menu within the last few years. It's almost overwhelming how many things are on there but I especially like the fajitas and of course the chips and salsa.The salsa is definitely 5 stars. I've gotten college kid servers who were cleaarly stoned, twice! My eating partner and I asked what one of their favorite things to eat was, and it was classic to see the look of delight in his red eyes, because he got to dispel his great wisdom of Rosita's fare on us. \"Dude...anything with the red sauce is the best...\"  I wonder if he hit the Cheeba Hut next door after a serious case of the munchies?"}
{"text":"Ordered Togo & when I got it was cold. It was sitting out on the bench when I came to pick it up. Also there wasn't enough salsa, one hot sauce & one salsa."}
{"text":"Street tacos were not street tacos and the fideo was awful.  Classic you get what you pay for and not good Mexican food.  Expected authentic Mexican food and got what tasted like day old, reheated in microwave food."}
