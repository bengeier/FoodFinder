{"text":"Not understanding how people like this place.  Got spring rolls and bun bo hue.  Food took forever to come out even tho there were 3 ppl in the restaurant.  Spring rolls were worst ive ever had.  Beef in soup stunk so bad even though i removed all of it it tainted the broth and there were 2 tiny half pieces of sausage in a large. Didnt even even finish a quarter of it. Mad at myself for paying. Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here...and not impressed.  Service was TERRIBLE!  No one greeted, acknowledged or seated is when we walked in.  So we seated ourselves, and after waiting 10 minutes, a lady came by to drop off menus.  She seemed to be the only person working, and she clearly couldn't handle 4 tables at 1:30pm lunch time.  After ordering, food took an eternity to arrive.  We had to ask for water after sitting there for so long with nothing on our table.  Food finally arrived, and it was pretty good, but don't think it made up for the bad service.  My avocado shake also came AFTER I finished my food, which I would have preferred to drink WHILE I was eating.    Last but not least, as we left, I realized they charged me $9.50 for plain noodles!  I wanted just noodles, to go with my shrimp on sugar cane app.  I asked her why it cost so much for plain noodles when I could have got pho w beef toppings for the same price.  Most restaurants only charge $5 or so.  Anyway, she looked at it, and reduced it by a dollar.  Well, thanks for the discount lady!!    Needless to say, not happy.  Would not come again.  I also gave ZERO tip."}
{"text":"Very authentic Vietnamese cuisine with a large selection of traditional dishes. I love the ones I ordered so far (combo rice, pho, bun thit nuong, hu tieu Nam Vang, etc). Their prices are very reasonable which is always a plus in my book. My family only go there because we know we won't be disappointed. The one and only good Vietnamese restaurant in Markham, Richmond-hill area."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food was quite disappointing. We tried the special pho and the beef brisket noodle soup. Flavours were bland and they were reeeeeally skimpy on the meat. The beef brisket noodle soup base just tasted weird. People who left really good reviews need to try out other Vietnamese restaurants. They also charged us extra for a few additional tiny pieces of lime. We also tried the wings which were tiny and expensive considering the number of pieces that they give you per order. They didn't give you any sauce to go with them which was a shame. The only positive was that the tea that they served was iced steeped tea which was refreshing on such a hot day."}
{"text":"As others have noted service can be a bit inconsistent, but because it's a small family own eatery I'll cut them some slack. It's located in possibly the worst plaza in the GTA. Access to the plaza is impossible unless you're driving westbound on Hwy 7 or Southbound on Langstaff. Whoever designed the intersection was incompetent! Most of the businesses have failed over the last 10 years and Saigon occupies a space that has been inhabited by a burger joint, middle eastern restaurant and a Starbucks. Fortunately they seem to be surviving and the food is pretty solid. There's not much choice in this area for restaurants unless you drive 6 kms east along Hwy 7 so hopefully they can survive."}
{"text":"This is mine and husband's favourite Vietnamese restaurant in all of the GTA.  I am a Vietnamese food connoisseur and have eaten at many authentic pho restaurants but this one is at the top #1.  We have only discovered this about 6 months ago everytime driving along Hwy 7 so finally I told husband to let's stop by one time and give it a try.  We brought our baby here when she was shortly born and the owner was very nice and loved her.   These are the must tries:  1) BBQ chicken and rice is so good, flavourful, tender, broken rice with it makes a perfect combo.   2) steamed egg is very authentic and tastes like what I remember back home in Vietnam.   3) bun bo hue very authentic and flavourful, beef is very tender, very generous amounts of meats.   4) hu tieu, my first time trying it and it was very delicious. The soup was hot in temperature, good mix of vermicelli noodles and yellow noodle and  quite a few shrimps.   5) spring rolls were exactly how spring rolls are supposed to taste, they used taro and only a authentic Vietnamese restaurant would do that, deep fried to a perfected golden colour and moist on the inside.   6) beef noodle pho, the soup broth was so flavourful you can tell they must have cooked the broth for a very long time, fresh slices of beef perfect for the steaming hot bowl, the noodles are so fresh and cooked perfect.    Perhaps the location is not very widely obvious so the place isn't overly busy.  I highly recommend anyone in the area to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, acceptable service, nice staff and clean restaurant. I ordered medium size beef Pho. It was a very big bowl! Very tasty. I will definitely go there more often."}
{"text":"Lovely family business. Always had amazing food and good service. Very cozy environment. Love the pho and porkchop on rice."}
{"text":"My bf and I ate here twice on our short trip to Toronto. Didn't know what to expect when we first stopped in as we were hungry and just wanted a quick bite before heading into the city. Overall, the food was decent. We liked Pho out of the 4 dishes that we tried. The service was friendly. I give it a 5 star review since the employees here were welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"Ate here with family. It was a good meal with relatively fast service. You could get some vietnamese dishes here that you dont normally get at pho shops. Helps to know vietnamese cuz a few dishes we ordered like grilled fish and grilled pork werent on the menu but off posters on the wall"}
{"text":"There was nowhere else within this vicinity for a quick Pho fix. I didn't expect much and was a little concerned about the raw beef with low foot traffic. I walked in before noon and there was already several tables seated, so I thought I was pleasantly proven wrong. They were friendly, place is very clean and the menu was very elaborate. I've uploaded a page of the menu with the \"traditional\" Viet soup noodles aside from Pho. I had raw beef with tripe pho. Just as good as any other I've had. I'm not rating 5 stars only to not devalue the 5 star they might get from true pho connoisseur."}
{"text":"It is what it says it is and for this I'm happy.  The bad thing is that after the road construction they've made this place harder to access if you are travelling east bound. Either u turn at the light or take the turn and u turn there.  Very casual atmosphere and very typical pho place. Like the Vietnamese run establishments because not just the pho but the grilled and fried stuff are all good. Was happy to order their house special and some spring rolls. Very tasty, aromatic and fresh. Prices as expected were under $10 and you can do fine eating the medium and be full the whole day.  They accept all payment forms not just cash and have a decent take out selection too. They also do the Thai items too using a lot of the same ingredients though I didn't get a chance to try that this time. Given the location and given the value of a nice place to stop if you're travelling through the area.  4.0 out of 5.0 and happy to stand by that."}
{"text":"I'm really into pho - it's my favourite kind of soup. The soup base of their pho is the best I've had in the GTA - super-flavourful, more than other places. If you love pho, you will love this soup. The times I have gone have been off-peak hours and the service was a bit slow, mostly because one person was making the food and providing the service.   So, why the -1 star? Well, firstly, I found they were a bit chincy with the meat. Secondly, I found the price for pho a tad expensive compared to other places - most other places are $8 or so for a large and here it was $9.50. However, the taste of the broth makes up for both of the above, and I'll definitely be going back.  You should definitely try it once, if you love pho, to understand just how tasty the soup base can actually be."}
{"text":"For Viet food, this is a real disappointment. They are in my hood and I'll never come back here again. The food quality is bad and the price is high. Seriously no wonder this whole plaza is gonna go under."}
{"text":"Saigon Grill is kind of in the middle of no where and if you driving at 80 km along Hwy 7, you might even miss it.   Menu is quite standard as with most of the Vietnamese restaurants. Since I was alone, I ended up only order Bun Bo Hue ($8.50) which is my to go Vietnamese Noodle instead of Pho. Though it does not have all the traditional toppings but  beef is of good cut and quite tender.   I will be back to try out other items on their menu. Price is a little more than other Vietnamese restaurants but being in this area with no competition, it is worth paying more for decent Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Saigon Grill seems to be located in a empty sketch area in Vaughan, but don't judge the restaurant based on its location or looks, its pretty good! The menu has a large variety of different pho dishes as well as other rice dishes too. Their prices are typical of other pho restaurants and pho entrees go around 8.50 for small and 9.50 for a large. But the small for me was pretty large enough, portions are really good and there seems to be a lot of meat. The soup base was delicious.   The restaurant itself is very clean and spacious, and waiters are pretty responsive. Food came out super fast (as it should). We got the viet coffee and it was AMAZING. It had a really strong coffee taste and the right amount of bitter and sweetness."}
{"text":"Pho Who doesn't love a bowl to hit your peak of food satisfaction! My favourite joints in the city currently are in Scarborough Out of the way and too far Been seeking for closer options that are worthy to repeat visits  First i was skeptical The plaza is dying and pretty empty When i entered the restaurant, i was the only customer while i saw the owners/workers just chilling at a table talking their local tongue Some hope was ingrained again because they were speaking vietnamese, has to be authentic and good right? Not necessarily...we shall see  Ordered a large house/assorted mix pho Took awhile to come, maybe like 15min? Its all right, im patient and dont expect it to be like a fast food restaurant   Finally the bowl arrived! Before diggin in Take a whiff, smell meets my approval Take a spoonful of the broth, full of flavour They dont cheap out on portions and just looking at the broth, its beautiful No overcooked noodles or meat, just the right temperature and hot broth (oh im sure you all have experience luke warm pho at bad places before) I think i found a winner :D Incredible!!!  Absolutely love it, almost on par with my fav place :)  Other reviews mentioned bad service Yeah i can see that Even while i was the only customer, it was tough grabbing their attention for the bill haha But the food, just wow! I have return many times since, just worth it! If you love pho and in the area, just go and try it now!"}
