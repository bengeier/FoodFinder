{"text":"3 - Stars I know.  Although the food was fabulous, our waiter left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and questioning whether or not we should give it another shot.

Our party of 6 sat down and we were promptly greeted by our waiter who pressed us for sake tastings.  I'm not a fan of sake, I try it and I hate it everytime...he was convincing, so I tried a \"taste\" and still I hated it.  The rest of our party liked it and he just brought out a bottle.  I ordered a bottle of wine to share and we went on to look at the menu.

He was oh so convincing that instead of ordering we should allow the chef to prepare us a \"tasting\" menu that would be complimentary to our tastes and desires of a sushi experience.  I was hesitant because he was pushing this \"tasting\" menu as much as a car salesman pushes a car knowing you have cash in your pocket.  It seemed slimy and creepy to me.  As a control freak I immediately had reservations, but everyone else thought it would be a good idea.

The fish was incredible, although I have no clue what came out.  It all came out so fast and the portions were so small there was literally one piece and one bite per person at the table.  Before we knew it the bill came out and the looks on the faces of the ones paying it were in shock.  Over $800 for our \"tasting\" menu with one bottle of $36 wine and one bottle of $85 sake.

My initial creep factor was right on, my stomach was empty, and my pocket was bruised.  For $800 for a party of 6 with a little over $100 worth of drinks I like to think I at least feel full at the end of my meal and at least have a buzz.  So I'm sure we will be back because of the Fun Center to drop the kiddos in, but this time I will be in control of what I order."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Fish were fresh and comparable to the fancy sushi at the $$$$ sushi spots on the strip. I was able to get happily full on the sashimi alone without spending double. Hubby was surprised when he saw the bill - he thought it would be double like at home in the SF bay area. 

The daily special menu had an uni sashimi and the scallop and uni carpaccio. I couldn't resist. Fresh uni at a decent price is hard to find. The dishes were perfect. No fishy aftertaste that is common with not fresh uni. Reminded me of the fresh uni I had in Japan's fish market. They were out of the Steamed abalone with truffle oil by 8:30pm so I was a little disappointed to miss out. 

Also the only Japanese fatty tuna left that night was akami. It was still buttery goodness. I would have loved to try the otoro.

I was still a little hungry so I ended with the 3 assorted sashimi of salmon, tuna, and hamachi - my faves. All fresh and good size pieces. 

Hubby had the sukiyaki pot. It was smaller than we expected but the quality was perfect. Beef was fresh and cooked just right - not dry. Sauce was properly salted. Usually other places can be too salty. And hubby was happy with the clear noodle. Usually it comes with more starchy noodles to fill you up. 

Hubby also enjoyed the spider roll. He said the rice was fresh so it was soft and the crab was fresh. He said other places usually use old hard crab. 

Neither of us tried the yakitori. Next time. Considering it's an izakaya, its non-yakitori offerings were surprisingly delicious. 

The service was good. Appropriately attentive. Server helped pick the perfect sake for me - small 300 ml light, slightly dry and sweet.

Will definitely have to come here next time I am in LV."}
{"text":"We came here because my wife got a $15 credit on $30 check and because she wanted to try something different. We ordered two appetizers and one main dish. The main dish, shrimp and spicy noodles was excellent: big tasty shrimp, spicy noodles with a few veggies. The two miniature lobster tacos were OK altho the delicate taste of lobster is hard to survive when thrown into a taco. The little spicy shrimp appetizer was very tasty altho obviously very high in fat content. My wife ordered a Sapporo beer and the waiter brought the 20 ounce bottle, not the smaller bottle without asking which she preferred. The waiter also upsold us to the spicy shrimp appetizer from the crab cakes. Since we didn't get the crab cakes, I don't know if this advice to spend a couple bucks more was good or not. Otherwise the service was excellent. I gave four stars because we liked two of the three dishes a lot, nice ambience and good service altho I am not sure if the waiters have instructions to upsell. Definitely not a value proposition, but an upscale, innovative restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best services but food's even better. They also have a big selection of sake. Uni is so good. If you have a bad experience from other places like me and didn't wanna eat it again. You have to try it here. Sashimi is fresh and yakitori is a bomb. Price is also reasonable."}
{"text":"Everytime we come the service is always on point. I came in twice this month with my family who were visiting and everyone loved it. The food has flavor and everything we ordered always comes out hot or all the sashimi dishes come on top of crushed ice. This place is perfect for Japanese bar food"}
{"text":"Best sushi we've ever had. Hiro \"sushi master\" was very knowledgable, and very very friendly!!! We recommend this place to anyone who is near red rock casino!!!"}
{"text":"A great overall dining experience.  The food was interesting and well prepared and the service was excellent.  Atmosphere was also wonderful."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this place with very high expectation.  After moving here from OC three years ago, we have been craving for a good Yakitori joint.  
Well after our first visit, we haven't returned to Hachi again. Couple of the Yakitori order we placed were under cooked and semi raw.  This is a no no in my opinion especially with pork or chicken meat.  I thought of complaining to the server but decided not to after the second dish came out with under cooked meat.  Whoever trained the guy doing the Yakitori pieces did not do a good job imo.
I am Japanese and have been eating yakitori since I was about 5 years old.  I have been to real high end Yakitori restaurants in Ginza and other part of Tokyo.   In OC, there were couple of super good Yakitori places as good as Japan.  Staff cooking in OC places are not Japanese but they are trained well so they cook well.
My favorite Yakitori place in LV so far is Cocokara.  
Maybe I will try Hachi again soon and see if they have improved.  I will write a review again after my next visit."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and it never disappoints. Always consistent in quality and service with a wide price range so that you don't have to worry about breaking the bank. I recommend their carpaccio (yes, all of them)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside of the Red Rock Casino Hotel.  $8 for a variety of 38 items and the items are definitely worth it! They also have a regular menu with lot's to choose from.  I had the chicken fried rice,  vegetable tempura, and beef skewers which was plenty enough for me.  The servings are very generous. 

The servers and hosts are all very friendly and attentive.  You must ask for Troy he was the best!  He also suggested the Asian Pear Tart for dessert which was to die for and I will be sure to order this again the next time I'm there.

Love it!"}
{"text":"We will definitely come back. We tried the Pork Belly, chicken thighs, Paitan Ramen and baked mussels. Very affordable appetizers range from $2 to $10. Loved it"}
{"text":"The service is horrible here. 10 minutes for them to acknowledge that we were seated, 10 minutes more before they got our drink orders. We almost left before ordering food. We had come here with the intention of having some delicious sushi. Not so. We left spending over $100 and felt underwhelmed and still hungry. Meh."}
{"text":"I come to Vegas every year. Of all the places around, this place is THE BEST when considering price, taste, atmosphere, etc... 

Every single thing on the menu is top notch."}
{"text":"Their sushi was ok.
Me and my friend had 

1) shrimp tempura with creamy sauce - was too heavy for an appetizer
2) 4 different kind of sasimi appetizer - it was cutted to thin and soaked in suace I couldn't taste the fish 
3) uni nigiri - ok but it wasn't fresh fresh
4) seared salmon belly nigiri - yum!
5) unagi nigiri - ordinary nigiri that you can get in any sushi restaurant
6) one of their signature roll - I forgot the name of the roll, the server recommended it to us.  It had mango on the top and the taste? very unique.
7) shrimp skewer - 5 out of 5  

Service - 4 out of 5 

spent $ 90

It was ok experience overall but not worth spending $90
I've been better places.. cost less... more fresh..
For nigiri, rice is very important and I don't know why they don't use Japanese rice.
Vinegar in rice was too weak."}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing here!  I tried the sea urchin sashimi and it was very fresh and yummy!  The only disappointment is the lack of ramen and udon here.  Hachi serves mainly sashimi, some izakaya and yakitori.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is the price. It is a little bit more expensive compared to the other similar Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"had a party in one of the private rooms, ordered several apps and rolls, food was overall okay but not UH MAY ZING. bill came out to $500 because they tacked on a $20 \"amuse\" fee, the server said it was the cake cutting fee (party of 8 people) and a TWENTY percent gratuity. if you are coming in a large group be aware of what you order, i told them we didn't order some of the items but our server said it was because one of the rolls we ordered \"didn't have a button\" so they entered a $35 '8 piece sashimi' instead. yea. a $35 sushi roll ??? I don't think so. never again. I work in the food and beverage industry, having a server tell you what you ordered when 'the customer is always right' is NOT OKAY. spend less money at a real japanese place like raku"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is delicious.  It is a very modern atmosphere that fits the food they serve.  I highly recommend the salmon, avocado, and mango roll; it has a very crisp taste.  The sumpin' sumpin' roll, spider roll, caterpillar roll, and the yellowtail sashimi are all delicious too.  If you like sashimi with a citrus taste the fluke tiradito is something to try.  For dessert, I had a raspberry floating island.  It was so good that we actually asked the waiter for another one.  We would've asked for more, but the second floating island we asked for was the last one they had.  All in all, this place is a place that I will visit again for the great food and service."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous and well priced, get off the strip and eat here!"}
{"text":"Great sashimi 
Must try hamachi belly awesome
The Yakitori Izakaya
 pork belly to die for

Ask for Mimbu San  the head chef or Sunshine a great waitress for best service

They just opened but definitely worth try

BTW this is coming dro an Asian foodie"}
{"text":"Nicely priced. Great selection. Roomy sushi bar. One of the better casino sushi restaurants around."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while now but it was just always out of the way for me.

Came around 10 last night with a friend and to our surprise there wasn't a wait! Was seated immediately and given a good amount of menus to look at. 

I was expecting the food to be quite similar to this other place that i go to but there was a slight difference- for starters I got a lychee chu hai( must try!), Ika karrage, garlic edamame, zucchini wagyu, cheese Yaki, sweet corn, tamago Yaki and cheese Chikuwa. All were delicious! 
There after, the rest was history- I started to forget what I had ordered, lol. To finish it all off we got the honey toast with red bean topping.


Interior was clean and inviting
Our server Sunshine was knowledgable about the menu and very kind. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"great service and food. Not big place but enough. Beef tongue is great. we need end with pork on the rice, wow, that is super......Love this place. will come back"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on sushi, but for my tastes Hachi certainly delivers. I've been here a couple times and their rolls are not only delicious but look like little works of art! The Pink Elephant (spicy crab, shrimp tempura, sweet mustard wasabi) is pricey at 16 bucks but at a place like this that's to be expected. It's one of my favorite rolls. 

The interior design of Hachi is beautiful. It's modern and intimate. There is a small bar area offset from the main dining room as well as a sushi bar overlooking the kitchen. I've only visited early in the week but it was relatively slow during dinner hours. I'm wondering if they have changed their HH or discontinued it because $6 for a beer at 5:30 doesn't seem like a deal to me. But that's just a minor detraction on an otherwise fine experience. It is Vegas after all. I'll be back Hachi!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The staff was all very friendly, professional and appeared to take pride in their jobs. The food and drinks were amazing. We had so many rolls I can't remember them all but they were all tasty. 

I strongly recommend the french bean tempura and shishito peppers. 

You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Having been to Japan fairly recently I'm genuinely impressed with the quality of food here at Hachi!  Every single thing we ordered was tasty and fresh and incredibly well made.  I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Doesn't deserve even one star. But that's the lowest and that's what they deserve. One of the worst experiences ever! Don't go! They don't value their patrons. Five of us went for dinner. If you want a good sushi experience try Sushi Fever.  The restaurant was not very busy. It was more than half empty on a Wednesday night.  One of us ordered a teriyaki steak and side of chicken fried rice. The others decided to have sushi and sashimi. We ordered off the the more expensive right side of the menu expecting better. The waitress was very unattentive and distracted. Miso soup was ordered and poke appetizer. The food did not come out  for almost one hour. The server from the kitchen brought out one bowl of chicken fried rice that sat on our table as a side dish 15 minutes before anything else came out. The soup came out at the same time as the entre only after asking or it. The poke was literally three small pieces of tuna the size of a thumb nail with a bunch of fried stuff covering it to make it look like more than it was. It was overed in a overly powering sweet sauce.
After waiting an inappropriate amount of time I asked a women walking by to speak to the manager. She said she was the manager. I explained how we have waited for a long time and we have yet to receive our dinner. I also complained about how one side dish is sitting on the table for 15 minutes getting cold.
She said she would find out what was going on with our sushi. The 3 rolls all came out  on one plate  was unimpressive and indistinguishable as to what anything was. No one explained what was being served just dropped and left. The manager nor the waitress ever returned to find out how our food was. Uni was also ordered and never was served. The portions, the terrible service, the presentation was extremely disappointing.  After a $184 bill I  actually had a peanut butter sandwich when I got home since there was not enough food to satisfy a normal dinner.
Please don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some beer and snacks and decided on this place based on the reviews. Not super crowded or loud so that was a plus. They use the super hot burning charcoal here for the grilled items. Of the items I tried, the best were fresh water eel, salmon belly, pork belly, chicken thigh yakitori, fried chicken thighs. The beer price was reasonable and the service was prompt and courteous. I would return."}
{"text":"This Japanese Tapas restaurant is awesome. The servers and cooked greeted us with a Japanese cheer. The atmosphere is contemporary, and inviting.  Everyone is very nice and attentive. The food is awesome, you have to try the unagi (Eel) or chicken \"toriyaki\". The lovely BBQ charcoal goodness can be smelled from outside (honestly, that's what drew us in). The prices are affordable too, for awesome charcoal grill food. Order a sake as well. \"Kanpai!\"  you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I've never been to Japan, however when I do finally make it there this is how I imagine the food will taste.  Everything that we ordered was SO delicious!  
The location of the restaurant has a lot of competition in such a small strip mall: Chubby Cattle, District One Kitchen, Chada Thai & Wine and Ramen Tatsu to name a few (all of which are bookmarked and I have yet to try).
My husband and I enjoyed the food so much that I did not even take pictures of what we got so I took pictures of the menu so I could remember what we ate.
It's awesome that you can try a little of everything instead of being committed to one big entree.  Portion sizes are decent and sushi was very fresh.
We tried a little of everything and ordered the following:
(We are not very adventurous and stayed away from \"exotic things\" ie: tongue, pork belly, intestine etc..) 
Sushi 
Passion Roll $11.50 Spicy tuna and cucumber inside and tuna on top were so fresh
**Natto Roll $3.50 (for me) if you do not know what this is then skip it.  It is fermented soy beans so healthy and good for you however it is an acquired taste and something that I have been eating since I was a little kid. Whenever I go to a Japanese or sushi restaurant I look to see if there is Natto.

Ikayaki $7.95 The squid is marinated in their signature \"Tare\" sauce and was prepared perfectly.
Dynamite $8.95 Baked scallop, crab, mushroom and onions baked in a mayonnaise? sauce, one of the best we've ever had!
Sukiyaki Hot Pot $7.65 The meat was not fatty and the broth was very tasty.  There was a lot of food 3 pieces of tofu, clear noodles, bok choy, enoki mushrooms, onions and green onions.
You can add rice and miso soup for $3.00
or rice, miso soup and California roll for $7.50
Cheese Chikuwa Tempura $4.65 I liked this one, my husband not so much.  It was a very interesting texture combination with the melted cheese, chewy fish cake and slight crisp outside from the tempura batter.

Yakitori-All Yakitori is cooked on Bincho-tan Charcoal that is imported from Japan so that they can make it as authentic as possible and also makes the food crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside.
Chicken Thigh Tare $2.25
Chicken Thigh with Citron Pepper $2.50-Hubby really liked this one, it had a good flavor but a little too spicy in a peppery way for me.
Shitake Butter $1.85
Okra $1.50

Dessert
Honey Toast I was very excited about this for dessert and almost didn't get it because I was so full from dinner, but I did and OMG it was the tallest piece of bread I have ever seen! It was so delicious! Bread, vanilla ice cream and honey! Very basic but so yummy and a MUST to top off your dinner, save room!
They also had a a pretty big selection of sake both hot and cold, by the bottle or carafe.

Overall we had a great dinner experience and will be telling everyone we know to go and check this place out!  We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and design of the place is pretty good. There is one particularly attentive guiding individual amongst the wait staff coordinates well.  Food - hit or miss. The grilled items were good. Sea items: blue fin previously frozen but good quality, uni ... chef should have tested the bunch in advance of serving. Raw vegetable items were different - eggplant with dashi and bonito was refreshing. Pea sprouts were eh. Price per head was a little high in the end. Return is iffy."}
{"text":"\"First of all, this is an upscale restaurant. Their prices are high, the quality of food is high, service and knowledge is paramount. Get over it.\"  (from Jen K. aka Shorty Got Lolo).  I've been fortunate to have dined at Hachi several times.  Since they first opened to last evening, Thurs. Dec 3.  Every single time has been a 5 star experience.  We were enjoying ourselves after eating last evening and one of the cute hostess girls needed our table so she got us seats at the bar and bought us Champagne !  The bar area is really nice also.  I've eaten at a lot of Japanese restaurants and Hachi is one of the absolute best.  Quality of food, Quality of preparation, Quality of presentation, Quality of service.  You won't be disappointed.  The Eight Dollar Menu should make Everyone Happy !"}
{"text":"Ichiza is better.  The only thing I like was their wagyu yakitori.  We ordered mostly yakitori: chicken thigh, wagyu tongue (ok), wagyu beef (good), pork belly (meh), duck (meh), grilled octopus (ok)

We won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Hachi has a beautiful atmosphere with really good food. Yes Bernie is \"HOT\" my husband loves to ask her saki questions but the food is good. 

The downs are that th pieces of sashimi are small, and expensive. But it is a nice place to go and relax if you like sushi"}
{"text":"Love this place- the menu, atmosphere and servers are great.  Nice and intimate or modern and classy with a group of friends.  Love this place!  Would totally go back."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is friendly and accommodating. I come here multiple times a month and order the same things. The staff knows I I'll pretty much order the  same things and are taking my order down right when I'm seated(no way am i being rushed its just how i like it) and starts to bring out all the nitpicking extras I like. The food is always the same quality every time which I enjoy because nothing worse than coming in for something you really enjoyed last time being not as good the next. I will continue to have this place as my goto for as long as time would allow."}
{"text":"Good variety and quality of foods, but dont come for the sushi theres a lot better elshewhere for cheaper."}
{"text":"Surprised I never reviewed my past dining experience at Hachi as this review is strictly for my experience over the long weekend. Words cannot describe how amazing the food was this time around. 

Given we did not have comps to use or a host to pay for our bill this time around, the food was on point and came with so many options such as dipping sauces. The kumamoto oysters set the mood right as they came with three types of dipping sauces.

Next, we ordered two sushi rolls, one of them was a a spicy tuna as I forget what the other way. Everything melted in our mouths and made use very happy campers. 

The gave us an amuse bouche to start which was gross. Otherwise, a great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent just like most reviews state. The We Love Locals coupons make this place an Incredible Bargain. Especially since you can pair them with the Half Price Gift Cards that are available occasionally on the We Love Locals website. Bottle of Sake and Two full meals at $ 60.00 Net Cost. WOW !"}
{"text":"\"Legitimate\" sake bar. Food is awesome, especially the bincho charcoal grilled skewers. This is coming from a Japanese person  so trust me with this place. Ice cold Kirin draft and Tako-wasa. Mmmm."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Loved the Kobe beef sashimi and the variety of specialty rolls. A little pricey but your in Vegas and at a resort so what do ya expect?"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. I prefer to sit at the bar. Very large restaurant. Bar area, sushi bar, dining room, and private rooms. Nice happy hour. Plenty of drink and food specials. Traditional sushi is available but, there unique specialty rolls are a must try."}
{"text":"They have a wide selection of Sake and Japanese craft beer that I wanted to try all!!!

There was a speciality sake called Ikezo Sparkling Peach Sake that was served with champagne glass! It is jelly sparking sake which I never seen anywhere in US! It was jello!!!! Very tasty and enjoyable Unique sake! Must try!

Food was absolutely great! Their Tsukune is hand made and made from Fresh (usually many restaurant pre-cook) and cook with Low heat which makes tsukune very juicy! 

Also all Yakitori is cooked with BINCHOTAN charcoal!! Which makes a lot difference! Significant difference on flavor and more tender inside!

They have a great Sashimi too! We had assorted sashimi with 6kinds! OMG it was fantastic! And you won't imagine how big it would be with that price! Must try!

Interior is very nice and clean! All servers and chefs are friendly and we got great service.

Ever thought I live 30 min away I will definitely come back!! Can't wait to try more!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a trusted fine cuisine food addict friend much like myself.  I can honestly say that I've never tasted unique Japanese dishes like this before.  Simply AMAZING!  From the Bacon Wrapped Enoki to the Halibut Sea Urchin Carpaccio, all the flavor from the chef's ingredients worked so well together.  Did I mention that the chef is actually Japanese?  One of my favorite dish was the Pork Belly Yakitori skewer.  OMG! The smoky flavor coming from the meat was so unique.  Our waiter later told us that they actually import the special charcoal directly from Japan!  Definitely worth making plans for on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Better try this, will see you most likely to be there too. Alot better compared to most yakitori place to go in lv"}
{"text":"One of our favorites. Skewers are great, the fish is quality, and the kitchen-prepared foods are always interesting and delicious.

Small plates, so you can order something that you're just curious about, and it's a $3 gamble. And I've been pleasantly surprised by nearly everything.

On my most recent visit, four of us ate (no drinks, unfortunately) very well for $100 plus tax and tip, including some very fair (but not exceptional) quality otoro and uni nigiri. Very fair for the price.

They'll also do an omakase if you ask, just tell them what you want to spend. $40 is a very nice price point for this. 

It's not 5*, but I've enjoyed every meal I've had there, it's phenomenal value, and I'm a regularly returning customer."}
{"text":"\"Hidden gem\" about 7 miles from the strip. 
This place is amazing ! Loved all the food we ordered, service was efficient .
They have  many sakes to choose, and many selections for food to try.
We were so happy to find Hachi, we will definitely come back.
We always appreciate Japanese food, Hachi reminded us how much we love Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Nicer decor and feeling than you might expect in a \"local casino\" I tried their most popular roll sampler and a sweet/spicy beef stir fry dish. I'd go here again, and glad to have something like this out in this part of Summerlin."}
{"text":"With so many izakaya places in town, this is probably my least favorite.  Selections are not as big as other places and they were even out of a few things on the menu when we went.  

First of all.. maybe it's a bad day at the restaurant, but they have to get their AC fixed!  My friend and I were literally sweating while eating our dinner.  The server saw me faning with my menu, she was kind enough to move us to another table with a better location with the ac.  We did feel the air move at the new table (one of the booths), but the air was not cold and minimal.  That made the dining experience not very enjoyable if I had to wipe my forehead while eating...and I wasn't in Asia eating street food.   

Service was great, with 4 or 5 servers in the little restaurant, they were all very nice and come refill your drinks and take away your plates.

Food is ok.  Solid 3.5 stars.  The chicken thigh skewers were perfectly grilled; the pizza one...well, guess it's our fault to order pizza skewer at a Japanese place; chicken wing was meaty and nicely flavored; grilled whole squid was done perfectly, not too charred to make it ika jerkey, just the right amount.  I wish they give you more ground ginger on the side (like Ichiza does) instead of more of that mayo sauce.  

Tried 2 cold dishes, the sashimi carpaccio and their version of tuna tataki.  Sashimi carpaccio is 2 stars at its best.  It's a combo of halibut and salmon, I think they dressed it with some kind of oil on top instead of just ponzu type of dressings.. it made it pretty oily for my taste, especially the salmon was already a belly cut with extra fat.  And again, didn't feel the dish to be very refreshing because it wasn't very cold... again, maybe I was just hot from the lack of AC in the restaurant.  Seared tuna tataki was much better, with a huge amount of red onions on top, although flavors were great and the right amount of dressing, wish the star of the dish would be more of tuna itself instead of red onions.  It's hard to find the tuna under the huge pile of onions.  Needless to say, both cold dishes were not my favorite of the meal.

Chicken karaage... I think they need to cut the pieces smaller, either bite or 2-bite size like other izakaya places.  They were huge pieces, 4 in an order, I felt like I was eating the chicken tenders from Cane's.  Although flavors and breading were pretty good, the size was just way too big and made it kind of gross... I had to double check every bite to make sure the inside of the chicken was fully cooked since the pieces were huge.  

Dessert: They didn't have the matcha soft cream, I was looking forward to try it.  Tried their Honey Toast because who doesn't love some Honey Toast, right?  Who knew you can screw up honey toast.  It was overly sweet....not sure if they were using extra honey or bad kind of honey, it's too sweet for my taste.  And they had to dust powder sugar on top to make it \"prettier?\", like it's not sweet enough, we need extra sugar on top.  The vanilla ice cream was probably a very cheap kind... it's SO WHITE, like hospital white and not very natural taste.  So, definitely would not order honey toast if I ever come back here.

Overall, it was a decent meal, most dishes were tasty, but nothing memorable.  My friend and I love Japanese food so was really looking forward to try this new spot.  Unfortunately I don't think I'd want to come back here.  With their limited selections of izakaya and overall taste of the food, i know I'll have much better experience at other places, unfortunately."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! My grandson ordered for all four of us and we had the lovliest, freshest assortment of beautiful Japanese food. Very attentive staff, sparkling clean environment, fun atmosphere and oi shii food. What more could anyone want?"}
{"text":"Fantastic yakitori place and the sushi was super fresh.  One of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  We started off with some hamachi sashimi then some chicken and pork belly grill.  Spot on!!  Love the sake selection.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Outstanding service from all employees, from beginning to end. Love the location plus great sake and interior/ ambiance. This place does many things right :) Thanks for a great night!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten at a Japanese restaurant & had a life changing experience via my mouth. I took my grandma out on a date and we decided to try Hachi. I'm very glad we did. We were seated within minutes and our waiter helped us promptly, I want to say his name was Paul. We ordered the Pink Hibiscus Sake (it was sweet but I don't think I'd order it again), chicken pot stickers, crab & mango salad, a beef dish, chicken fried rice, & hot sake. Everything tasted great, my favorite being the chicken pot stickers and chicken fried rice. I have never had Japanese food that was light, not greasy, flavorful, and filling before Hachi. Our service was perfect. I really dislike being asked how I'm doing or if everything is okay every 5 minutes. Our server took our order, made sure it came promptly, gave me eye contact while making his rounds, asked me once or twice if I'd like to try anything else, made some suggestions, wam bam, thank you ma'am. I will definitely be returning to try more of the menu. Oh, and the decor is stunning. Next time you sit down in the main room, just look up :)."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm back in Osaka. ( visiting)

Excellent Yakitori .  I can't stop eating.  Hahaha.  My new late night hang.    The ice cold beer doesn't hurt either.    Ha !!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a late dinner. The open very late which makes it very convenient. Their oysters are really good, but I tell them to not put the radish and stuff to put on it. $1 a piece during happy hour. Very cozy setting. The booths are awesome"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   The sashimi, service and food is always great.   Not many true Japanese restaurants like this one in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here as a backup after our usual ramen place was packed with post-Christmas diners. The remodel from the previous restaurant is great - minimalist, clean lines yet warm. 

The service was quick and attentive; water glasses kept full. 

The food was great. Ordered a variety of dishes, but we were a little limited by our kids' immature palates so we didn't experience the breadth of the menu.  The menu was a little more extensive than I've experienced at other izakayas, though. Ordered: salmon sashimi, sashimi bowl, tamago yaki, oyako don, yakitori ($1.40/stick), chicken karaage, hire katsu, chicken skin chips, and honey toast.  These were small plates so they were shared amongst our family of five. The flavors were good but maybe generally on the sweet side. Fried chicken skin - how can you go wrong? The hire katsu is not as tender as I've had elsewhere (talking Tonkatsu Kiyoshi). Tare yakitori was sauced slightly and the charcoal taste was prominent. One kid thought it was overly smokey, but the mom and dad liked the campfire taste. Sashimi was very fresh and the thick cuts were appreciated. Honey toast was a highlight; best I've tasted in a long time - perfectly crunch on the outside and just enough honey to not make it overly rich.

We enjoyed our food. After eating standard Christmas fare for a few days, izakaya hit the spot. I would agree with another reviewer that this place is a little on the spendy side, but it's not entirely unexpected at the same time. Would totally come again...maybe without the kids next time."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour, only to find out they no longer have the same HH offers.
Service at the bar was friendly and I enjoyed my first cocktail.  
For appetizers, the fish part of the Fish and Chips was delicious; moist fish with a perfectly crisp tempura and flavorful dipping sauce.  The chips were cute, but flavorless.
I didn't care for the flavor of the Wagyu Yakitori, though the texture was fine.  My second cocktail was a Mango Chili combination that was all chili heat and no mango.  I can't imagine anyone consuming the entire glass as the overpowering kick got old after the second sip.  Even though my glass sat full for the rest of my meal, the bartender did not inquire if I liked it.
I did enjoy the Hachi Roll."}
{"text":"This place was beautiful first of all, the decor was so inviting and pleasant. It's definitely a date night spot! The sushi was very good, my favorite has to be the LSD roll!!! Delish! And the waiters were very nice and attentive. Overall, this was a very nice place but like I said before, more for just a date night."}
{"text":"Brilliant and very flavorful. Each little dish had its own flavor profile, all super special. Even our 1-year old loved it."}
{"text":"They use a special coal from Japan and it makes a difference! The skewers are so good! Plenty of drink choices to choose from, so ordering took us a while. The menu didn't seem like it was a lot, but there's quite a few choices. So there's bound to be something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I would die for sushi, it is just that delicous- yum yum!

The restaurant was really pretty and modern. I thought it would be very uptight but it was not at all. It was relaxing and was not to over priced, especially since they have an $8 menu. 

Their sushi was amazing, and for me when sushi is that good I do not even have to use soy sauce or wasabi. The rolls didn't fall apart on me, which I love- because to be honest I am not the best with the chopsticks. I am more of a fork and spoon kind of girl.

I am always looking for new sushi spots, and I would definitnely drive all the way across town to eat here."}
{"text":"Finding a good Japanese restaurant is so hard out here with all the choices and everything being mediocre, that is until we stumbled upon Hachi. This is a gem of a restaurant that my boyfriend and I adore. Let's start off with their yakitori. Their wagyu beef is awesome!!! We also had their pork belly and duck yakitori with salt and the pork belly was definitely just as flavorful and well seasoned as the wagyu. What I enjoy about their yakitori sticks is the char flavor that enhances the overall flavor of any yakitori sticks.
Their maguro and chutoro are fresh and I love how they serve it on a bowl of fresh ice to keep it cool. 
One of our go to dish is their chicken steak. As everything on their menu, this is also a dish full of flavor. What's becoming my favorite appetizer is their fried chicken skin. All I can say is YUM!!! It is fried to crispy perfection and again seasoned well with garlic salt. It's comparable to chicharon. 
What I didn't get to take a picture of was their special which was a marinated beef skirt steak. Omg!!! The best dish of the night. Nicely cooked to medium rare and so tender and fu of Japanese BBQ flavor. Anyone that has bbq'd skirt steak know it's not always an easy task as you need to also cut against the grain to keep it juicy and they definitely got this dish right. 
The staff is always friendly and courteous and it's pretty easy to be seated without reservations. This is one of my highly recommend spot if you're ever nearby Chinatown. 
The majority of the dishes are small portion size reminiscent of a tapas style so be prepared to spend some money but not a crazy amount if you like variety like we do."}
{"text":"Every dish we ordered were delicious! Wish I can remember the names...lol. We were just there last night too. Our waiter was also awesome and attentive. He definitely knows the menu well and gives great suggestions. Make sure to order the shrimp chipotle...something like that...sooo gooooood!"}
{"text":"Good soup but the wait to be seated is long. The waitress tended to our needs/orders but seems unable comprehend my request for warm water instead of coffee/tea. I am not just being cheap but I just want to drink warm water not tea or coffee since the soup is already warm. I'll go back again to dine but the thought of the wait without a place to sit in.... I'll pass for now."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Las Vegas/Summerlin area from Los Angeles and are in search of a really good sushi joint, similar to our all time hands down favorite (\"Sushi Nishiya\" Glendale, CA) http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-nishi-ya-glendale 

So we tried this place, we sat at the Sushi Bar but were saddened that we were not able to order directly from the sushi chef. Instead we needed to deal with a waiter who could relay our questions to the sushi chef standing right in front of us. But whatever, again we had to address the fact that we were there for Sashimi and had no interest in rolls. We were kinda guided through the menu but it was lacking variety and when the plates came out the Sashimi slice were so thin I could practically see through them. Although the food was VERY tasty I needed to order the Chilean Sea Bass in a Miso sauce, in order to fill somewhat satisfied. So all in all, I will leave this place as a \"Special Occasion\" sushi joint and probably eat prior to going since the portions are more on the appetizer side.

But so far for our weekly sushi fix, we are really liking Wayne's Sushi Bar http://www.yelp.com/biz/waynes-sushi-bar-las-vegas 
He's funny to hang with and he has quite a few dishes that are phenomenal, and we didn't even have to order. I asked him for the freshest fish of the day and he offered to just \"feed us Omakase style\" which was music to our ears!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love coming here for date night! Everyone is friendly and helpful! We like to come for happy hour when the oysters are only a dollar! They are amazing! Must try the squid and the tempura not greasy at all it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I came in here a few weeks ago around midnight for some ramen, since they popped up as the closest around me at the time. 

-I stood around for at least five minutes without being helped and when I was finally greeted it was 'are you an uber driver?' Staff seemed completely frazzled although it didn't appear to be that busy to me, but I could be wrong.
-One bowl of ramen was on the menu and it was honestly mediocre at best. The service was quick, however. 
- Still hungry I decided to grab a tuna roll and holy heck did I regret my decision. I made a point to specifically not order the spicy tuna roll because I'm not a fan of spicy sushi but when I ate a piece it was hot as heck! Definitely had wasabi everywhere but I ate another piece in the event that the particular piece had touched against the wasabi on the plate - this was not the case. 
-After asking the server what was wrong with my food, he informed me that their rice was made with wasabi? Or maybe it was the roll either way I scanned the menu and I couldn't find a warning about it anywhere. 
-I'm a server in this town and was utterly astonished when the food I gave back to the kitchen was on my bill. Never again."}
{"text":"Best Japanese food experience that I ever have.  Great service and excellence food.  As authentic Japanese food as  it can be.  I will come back again on my next Las Vegas visit."}
{"text":"Wow! Every dish was incredible. Between 6 of us we ordered sashimi, sushi dishes, several yakatori, whole squid, bacon wrapped asparagus, two types of shishito, NY steak, pork belly, sausage, hearty Hachi Miso soup, seaweed salad and the ultimate finale Honey Toast. Every bite delicious! But we doubled ordered the jalapeño chicken Yakatori, bacon asparagus and miso sauce edamame. Prices were so reasonable and the waitress was intuitively accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a great izakaya with delicious food and amazing service. The otoro is high quality and melts in your mouth. Everything grilled is delicious and you can really taste the difference with the quality of the charcoal. They have a great sake menu and beer on tap."}
{"text":"Best yakitori I've had. The garlic edamame was perfect! The pork belly was delicious, the duck with balsamic was also great. My boyfriend loved the beef misozuke, very flavorful and tender. The kire katsu was the best I've had, and the cabbage salad served with it was really good, with a delicious dressing. The karaage chicken was seriously perfection, and the sauce that came with it was fresh and had a lot of ginger, so good.

The honey toast for dessert is a must try, but huge, so be ready to share.

Service was awesome, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is my birthday when we went here, service is fantastic! Food is awesome but kinda pricey for their serving. The place was clean ambiance is good, all in all, everything is fine, and for sure will come back."}
{"text":"Great Izakaya with Soboro Gohan!!! Perfect place to eat Yakitori and enjoy a real Japanese Izakaya style restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm leaving another review because in my previous review I mentioned that we were not impressed with some of the items we ordered from the kitchen but we loved the yakitori and sashimi.

I've been going back to Hachi more since then, and I have been ordering solely sashimi, yakitori, and some fried stuff from the kitchen like chicken skin.  Everytime it's consistently delicious!!"}
{"text":"Beautifully presented, deliciously done Japanese food.  We had the grilled scallops, beef curry rolls, spicy tuna roll, unagi and salmon nigiri, and udon with veggie and shrimp tempura (perfectly fried, though the udon broth was a little bland.)

The decor is stunning.  The red blossoms hanging from the high ceilings could either be jellyfish or the sensation of being at the bottom of a pond looking at floating flowers."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow. Amazing sushi here. When you eat sushi, you can tell easy if it's fresh or not, this place only serve the best. I go to different places to find a great spot that serve great fresh sushi... this is definitely one of the best!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant in Vegas in my opinion. I go here quite often, and their service is never bad, neither is the food. Everything in here is amazing. I definitely recommend the Chicken Karrage with Special Negi Sauce. One of the best dishes for the price. The only downside is that it can be very busy on the weekends, but it is well worth the wait. The food tastes just like as if you were eating in Japan."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  It's ok for a sushi bar in the middle of the desert, I suppose.  The coveted toro was blah.  It didn't melt in my mouth like the best ones do.  I enjoyed their tuna better.  The salads are a delight and the sea bass is like sugar, perhaps a little to much caramelizing.  Overall, it was OK."}
{"text":"Very good experience.  Ate at the bar, ordered Edamame, and sampler 6 piece of their sushi.  It was also happy hour, so had the house hot sake.  It was all fantastic, though the Edamame was a little over-steamed.  Service was ok, but not as attentive as I needed at times (had to flag them down a few times, and place wasn't busy)."}
{"text":"Food: Wanted to check out the yakitori places here in Las Vegas, and Hachi has been a great experience thus far. The BBQ's were good, the pork belly and the squid were good choices. we also ordered some ala carte food on the menu and those turned out great as well.

Ambiance: The location is great for social drinking with finger foods to order.

Service: Service was great they accommodated my family, with 2 small children and were attentive to our needs.

Overall: Would definitely come back for the yakitori grills."}
{"text":"This place had the worst service in town as well as worst management. The food is overpriced for the quality as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE HACHI!!!!!
This place is consistently amazing!
The atmosphere is fun, dramatic and just really, really cool!!!!
The food & service.... incredible!
We regularly let our servers suggest the entire meal now.
We like to try different things every time and have not once had the slightest disappointment!
YAY Hachi!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We get it, it's in a hotel/casino that is technically owned by Station Casinos, it's not \"authentic,\" blah blah blah.  It's Vegas, folks- everything here feels manufactured!

First, you need to realize that this place is fantastic because you can go big on a $100+ dinner for two at a nicer Japanese joint at the Red Rock, OR you can spend less than $30 on dinner for two when you are rushing to catch a movie.

There was only one roll I tried here that I didn't like, and the name eludes me (will update review if I find it, but it was mainly because I dislike jalapenos, but the boyfriend wanted me to try it.

I love the Hachi roll, the SAM, the Little Sumpin Sumpin, and Smack rolls.  Their spider roll isn't as good as it used to be, something has changed so I might not order that in the future.  The real steal at Hachi are the hot entrees, such as the chicken yakisoba, which goes for $12-13.  A huge helping, definitely for sharing, for an awesome price.

As for cocktails, GET THE SAKETINI.  I don't care if you are a guy and don't want to sip on a bubblegum pink colored martini.  It is like candied sake, if there were such a thing, and you get a lychee fruit as garnish.  I get at least one every time.  Maybe I should start thinking about happy hour, hmmm.....

Hachi has something for everyone, even those who don't want to delve to far into the world of nigiri and other super-raw products.  This isn't really a place for families though, the atmosphere is geared toward adults, and why are you trying to drag your six year old to a sushi joint in a casino anyway is my question.

If you stay, live, drive, or work near the Red Rock, stop in some time.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here for my bd with my friends and my boyfriend. The food we ordered were everything good and server was very friendly and nice. We are really like this place and satisfied! We will come back soon. 

Me and my bf did uber eat from this restaurant as well because we like it!"}
{"text":"Hachi is a great sushi spot in the Summerlin area, located in the Red Rock Casino. I stop in here every couple of weeks and will meet friends for a bite. 

Their 38 under $8 portion of the menu is great! Some of my favorites dishes are:

-cucumber salad (huge portion)
-salmon/avocado roll
-salmon sashimi
-shrimp and rice noodles (not on the 38 under $8 menu)

Staff is always very friendly and the atmosphere is casual but chic."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and outstanding service. I'm not going to give you the frustrated food critic on social media review, I'm going to keep it real. The food was prepared and presented expertly. The flavors are all there, and the rest is in the pictures! Cupcake"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Everything is very fresh. Really a nice hidden gem. The parking lot is almost impossible to park in so arrive early to look for a spot or park in one of the parking lots close by.
This is a really fun place for small plates and sharing!"}
{"text":"After a long night exploring Fremont Street.. we ended up offstrip at this place. We were going to FUKU burger first but they had no more food.. yes I know.. so we ended up here since they don't close until 2:30am. We came at about 12:30-1am starving! 

The guy that greeted us and served us wasn't very happy about something. Sorry we came in? Or... maybe he was just having a bad night idk but I didn't like how cold he was.. 

The food was pretty good tho. They have a special type of soy sauce that tasted yummy. 

And They have a late jught menu of cheap items.. maybe too cheap.

I ordered the poke bowl.. the flavor is there.. but the fish was not.. pretty sure there were like 7 pieces of fish.. wish there was more fish.. even off of the late night menu like regular size with more fish because it tasted yummy. 

I also ordered a chicken thigh skewer which was small but it was only 1.85 glad I ordered that because I wanted more protein from my poke bowl.

My man and his dad shared the supreme salmon roll. It was yummy!

See the food was good, the hours are great, but the service and the amount of food was eh.

Would try again sometime tho.

3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Especially when it's the bald chef on the grill, we order more. We like their grilled scallops, spider roll, grilled garlic tuna nigiri, ikayaki, and green tea Panna cotta. Their chashu is to die for!"}
{"text":"I stayed at Red Rock Casino with a bunch of climbers and we all ate here one night since it was convenient to get a table for 11 people.

We ordered one of each roll on the menu, and a bunch of other appetizers. The B:42 (?) roll was definitely the best. Cannot go wrong with seared Kobe and lobster. Not just surf n' turf. More like yacht n' resort. lol

Everything else was pretty solid. We shared a nice bottle of cold sake (not the 1.8L one they tried to sell us for $180) and a bunch of beers. With a few desserts, it came out to only $69/person including tax/tip. Not bad for the amount of food we ordered and drinks.

I would definitely recommend this place if you are staying at the Red Rock Casino since it's really convenient and probably the best restaurant in the hotel."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant located inside of Red Rock Casino. We arrived late and actually were the last ones to leave the restaurant, but never felt rushed by any of the staff. Everyone from the hostess to our server was very attentive and friendly. 
I had Miso soup and we shared three rolls: Q, EE and Hachi... I found them to be extremely delicious. The fish was fresh and the rolls very well put together. The prices range from $11-18 per roll from what I recall. No AYCE here! They have few specialty cocktails and several beer choices..oh yeah, and a huge sake list!"}
{"text":"I went to Hachi couple days ago, I really like their menu because it explained well with picture. Their service awesome."}
{"text":"The rolls are all named after popular drugs from the 70's lol how could you go wrong? In all seriousness aside from nobu at the hard rock this is the best sushi in town. It is without question the best sushi in summerlin. I went with a friend and his parents (who happen to be high rollers at the red rock). We were treated very well and as the meal was a comp we tried almost everything worth trying on the menu. Sometimes Vegas really pays you back, this was definitely one of those times for me.

Try the tuna, it's pricey but if you're looking for a piece of fish that will melt in your mouth this is it. The manager walked by and showed us his iPad he said every day his guy in Hawaii goes to the local fish markets and sends him pictures. His sushi chef here then picks the best cuts and they are flown in fresh every day. He pointed to my plate \"that was swimming in the ocean, less than 24 hours ago\". Needless to say I was impressed. 

I'm definitely going back, probably with a date. This place has a stunning decor and would be the ideal place for a trendy night out. 

Highly recommend and by the way the hostesses are gorgeous. Lol not that I pick restaurants based on such things, just happened to notice :)"}
{"text":"The sea bass is one of the tastiest meals i've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Strictly Japanese, this place stays true to it's identity. The dishes are high quality, well prepared, but timing is the major issue here. Once the order is placed, dishes just come out willy nilly, leaving too much food or too little. Come here for authentic Japanese fare, and a respite from Vegas noise, a little gateway to Japan for the time being."}
{"text":"Really liked this sushi spot! Fresh fish, great atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff. The only suggestion I would offer - add a few rolls to the menu.  With all that great quality fish, it would be cool to see some unique rolls.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Best place we are in Vegas. I usually don't like oysters but these were so good I'd definitely order them again. The garlic seated tuna was delicious too, really everything was  really flavorful and amazing"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese style bar/tavern style, \"on-a-stick\" BBQ and other Japanese food.  They have raw fish (sashimi), sushi (nigiri and fusion roll), salada, noodle (ramen) and so on.  Nice modern interior with black color and ambient lighting.  Food and service is good enough. just I can't afford the price. I would be very happy to go if I have somebody to treat. lol"}
{"text":"Extensive menu from sushi to yakitori to a age mono (fried foods). 
They are fairly quick to bring food out and the service is always great!
I've held a couple company dinners that were around 10+ people and the service, speed and quality remained high. 
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For this being the only yakitori place in Vegas, thank goodness it's amazing :) 
**You can call for reservations**
They have table and bar seats, but the place overall is limited seating. The service was friendly, too. 

They give you a couple different menus, but all I was looking for was the yakitori. You order by the stick and things add up quickly, but how can you say no when the food is amazing? My absolute favorite was the pork cheek. Forgot to take enough photos of the food, but it's great how they keep bringing the orders out as they make it. It's an open kitchen so you can watch them grill the meats. 

I'm sure there's other things on the menu, but if you're craving yakitori, I mean you'll only have one choice, but it's worth it"}
{"text":"I'm hardly writing review on anything expect the experience is exceptional! And YES it is, Hachi is my favorite Japanese cuisine in town! very glad they finally opened on REAL JAPANESE CUISINE in Vegas. I called it cuisine coz the kitchen has renovation on food! And the special menu is changing all the time. More important, the food is renovated in Japanese style, NOT American style!!! That makes the entire restaurant awesome good in food. The service is also good. May not be good as you are purchasing a Lamborghini that salesman can fulfill you, but definitely on top. 
They also have a pretty good list on sake choice, well they are izakaya that makes sense. 
Whatever, you stomach speaks for you, so do I."}
{"text":"Don't judge the book by it's cover. Come and see for yourself that the food will speak for itself.
Must try
Pork Belly, salt or tare or 1 of each
Chicken skins
Tsukune
Parking can be a pain during the weekends, the restaurant is in a strip mall filled with various places to eat"}
{"text":"Chicken Karaage:
No fancy sauces needed! Prepared and served the way it should be! Just chicken marinated in a ginger-garlic-soy mix, coated with potato flour, and fried to perfection to give it that crunchy, golden-brown crust, that makes you recklessly take a bite of that steaming, juicy interior, leaving you no choice but to chase it with an ice cold bottle of Sapporo. The best part is they leave the skin on the chicken too!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced this is the best izakaya in town. I recommend their grilled squid, hamachi Kama, and their carpaccios particularly. They have a great beer and whiskey selection as well!"}
{"text":"We love Hach restaurant so much !! They have so much choice of Japanese sake and alcohol.All food is amazing!!! We love Wagyu Kush Yaki !! This Wagyu taste is  incredible!!! omg soooo
 yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant just opened up in the plaza full of yummy shops, Japanese tapas and sushi. The service has been 10/10 each time I come eat here and so is the music! Haha. The interior is quite nice too, I mean it's perfect to eat and talk stories with your friends, the ambience is just dark and loud music. 
Now the food, I ordered a hachi salad and it was made with rice crackers and that was pretty delicious if you ask me, a little too saucy for a salad but it was still good.
I also ordered hamaguri clams, 2.50 for a clam. They were a little hard/chewy and the sauce for the clam was a little salty. 
All the other stuff I ordered was up to par though! Like the salmon sashimi, the salmon rolls, sukiyaki ($15 for a bowl good for up to 2 people) chicken skewers, and the desserts. The oysters are okay not the best I've ever had. But if I had to really recommend anything my absolute favorites to order is the sukiyaki, the fish, and all the cheap little tapas. surprising they fill you up! That's probably my favorite thing about this restaurant, all the tapas are very good priced and the quality is pretty on point too with most of the stuff and the variety of stuff to choose from, but all still in the Japanese category. Oh and I would definitely recommend dessert, the matcha panna cotta is my absolute fav!! It has little red beans at the bottom and the honey toast is a little sweet and really honey but it's good for a group of friends and it's HUGE. My overall experience was 5 stars"}
{"text":"Been here twice and am in love with the place. We've visited during normal hours as well as happy hour.

*fresh oysters 2 pcs. $3.98 - with a ponzu sauce garnished with scallions. This is a must-get. The oysters are BIG and fresh, they apparently are korean oysters 5/5 

*salmon kama - grilled to perfection! Had the right amount of seasoning. The skin was nice and crispy and the salmon was succulent and not dry. Eat with rice to make it into a meal (:

*chashu - this I probably wouldn't order again. Was more lean than I'm used to, dry, tough and overcooked and barely had any sauce on it. Wish it had more fat in it..

*pork cheek - we preferred the pork belly over this. Didn't have much fat on it

*pork belly - delicious! Very juicy and the person grilling knows exactly when it's perfect!

*wagyu premium beef tongue - was a little too chewy for our taste but the quality is there

*Oyakodon - small serving size but had a good amount of soup. Juicy chicken and egg, not overly salty or sweet (:

*sashimi bowl $9.98 - my bowl had 2 ea. of tuna, salmon, whitefish, mackerel, and yellowtail. Fresh, was satisfying and I was able to finish it with no problem.

*nasu dengaku - it comes in two small pieces. Love the flavor but was kind of pricy for the amount you get lol

*Paitan ramen $10.50 - my bf really really loved this. It's on the pricier side compared to most ramen but is well worth it. The noodles had the perfect bite, was neither thick or thin but in between, perfect onsen tamago, and the broth was not too salty, subtle but flavorful.

Use the condiments! The pork skewers with salt went really well with the buta miso paste. Hachi soy sauce was sweet and salty which was different and I used it with my sashimi.

Service here is impeccable! We've always sat at the bar and all the servers make sure to check on you. Refills come on time which is a plus. Chefs are nice.

Overall I prefer Hachi over other izakayas, even over kyara. Kyara will be a close second."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent.  They have rolls for all levels of suchi eaters.  I had 2 great spicy tuna rolls and yummy appetizers.  The Red Rock Resort is beautiful and every restaurant in the resort is excellent.  Hachi has great service and wonderful food.  

One word of advice...no sake bombs.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I was too sad that my phone was dead during dinner tonight because everything looked amazing! 
It was our first time at Hachi and we definitely enjoyed everything! 
As you enter, you're greeted and helped right away. We sat at booth and they accommodated us with a high chair for my one year old. Lyu was our server tonight and made great recommendations. Throughout our dinner he was very professional and always made sure we were doing great. 
Tonight we tried the ikayaki, sashimi roll, juicy karaage, pork chashu, corn, and shrimp with tar tar. 
Everything was delicious!! I loved the ikayaki and sashimi roll for sure! It was SO fresh!!  I also don't eat meat, only seafood, so I'm happy that I was able to enjoy dinner. My husband had the karaage and pork chashu with rice and had no complaints. As I fed my daughter some of the karaage and pork chashu, I could tell that the meat was cooked very well. The pork chashu was soft and the chicken was crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside. She also enjoyed her dinner! 
Service all around besides Lyu was on point. Always kept our table clean and offered refills whenever needed. 
As for dessert we went with the honey toast which was \"the bomb\"! It was massive yes but so delicious! 

Overall, the restaurant itself is nicely decorated and very clean. 

We definitely will be back for more! Excited to try the sashimi don, carpaccio and other desserts next!"}
{"text":"I only stopped in for a quick bite and a drink with a friend. Got the sum thing sum thing roll, Lychee cocktail and a corn soup taster before my sushi roll came out.  I had a really nice little snack there. I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Went here last night.  I expected much better.  Salmon belly, toro and a special roll I got, smack or something,  wasn't anything special i've ever had.

If it was cheaper than ok but way overpriced for the tastes,  Service was great pretty decent. 

I probably will not return here for sushi again."}
{"text":"Just found my new favorite Japanese restaurant thanks to you Yelpers.  We had a pork chashu bowl, assorted sashimi bowl, yellowtail jalapeño carpaccio; wagyu beef skewers, grilled clams and scallops; hamachi and big fin tuna sashimi; seared garlic tuna tataki; whole grilled squid; otsumami appetizer (raw, seasoned baby octopus, cooked spinach, and enoki mushrooms); chicken steak; miso soup (with tofu, chicken, corn). 

The bill was cheap and everything was fantastic. They have a great selection of sake. Definitely get the chashu pork bowl and the chicken steak. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Nice place.they make more than 6 months.seafood is fresh,teriyaki tofu portion is small.car parking always full.friday may be better cause the asian bbq noodle which close every friday.60 dollars per head.service is good.
There are two tables and eight people in glass vip room.
The place have been a noodle , pho soup and japanses buffet."}
{"text":"Lounge Review:

Sometime after my third lap around the tables, this place finally caught my eye.

Looking to satisfy my craving for whiskey, I was really hoping to find some nicely aged Yamazaki but secretly hoped for Hibiki.

I reluctantly had to settle for Black Label neat and decided to wash it down with a side order of tempura.

Tempura was crisp, light and delicious.
They served an avocado tempura that was a rather half-assed attempt to try something different or a stroke of genius; considering how good it was, I'm thinking it was the later."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here and I got to say I like it!!!! The food is very good especially the oysters, the three sauces it comes with are good but when you combine them its fantastic. The sushi rolls are all unique in their own way. The best roll there is the sumthin sumthin roll.  I'll be eating here again since I got pretty much the whole meal comp'd."}
{"text":"It is not \"sushi at the mall\" or assembly line stuff.  It is still definitely chic, trendy, low-lit, etc.  Got a bunch of the 8$ items, and a couple of appetizers.  I think that is probably the best route to go here.  DO NOT come here to load up on food and to  \"feel full\" unless you're good with exceeding triple digit$ for two.

As a place that wants you to pay more to get more.  Here are some items to NOT get:

-- foie gras --  I know it is a sushi place first, but I hadn't had foie gras in some time Anyhow, the presentation of the foie gras plate was nice, with seared tuna as well...  it came off as if the chef put effort in it since it is change from being another sushi plate, but I expect a little bit more of the foie gras itself.  It was good but seemed a lesser grade or maybe cooked in an oil that didn't complement it.

-- o toro (fatty tuna belly) --  Good, but not great.  Same as the foie gras above in that it kind of misses the mark even though it was good.   It seemed seared very lightly to keep in the oils--It was surprisingly bland and tough for being sold as high grade stuff.  

SAKI NOTE:  I have hit some saki here and there.  The \"Hou Hou Shou\" Saki was freakin' good.  It's a great combo of sweet, citrus-y, fragrant, without being overly so in any of those categories and it wont claw at your throat on the way down."}
{"text":"Expectations were pleasantly met here tonight! Service came with a smile from the moment we walked through the door. The menu here offers quite a variety, but we stuck to exclusively the yakitori selection and it still made for a great dinner. The food came to our table in good time and was pretty darn super. Will certainly order the umeshiso chicken, pork belly, and beef tongue skewers again next time. Hachi served a great dining experience and I'm hoping to return for another."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, excellent cooked food.  I really loved the seared tuna with foie gras.  The lamb chops were incredible.  Really love this place.  If you gamble, you can pay with your points...fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing from the moment I arrived. Authentic Japanese food, the service was amazing! The waiter went out of his way to explain everything in Japanese to my mother and were knowledgeable about all the items on the menu. Food was amazing from the appetizers to dessert!  This place sets the standard for Japanese food in las vegas. A must eat!!"}
{"text":"What a great izakaya-style spot! This plaza is rife with great offerings, and I'm glad to see the new dishes offered here: a mix of hot and cold tapas, with some sashimi and yakitori grill items thrown in. Their charcoal grill items are featured, but their fresh fish items are standouts for us!

HOT DISHES
The grilled ika and grilled mackerel are both great! Nice blistering, perfectly cooked, simple and tasty. Daikon, lemon, and spicy mayo are offered alongside, but neither dish really needs it.  The chicken karrage was juicy, but not a standout. Crispy breading seemed uneven. 

COLD DISHES
The sashimi roll is perfection: fresh fish, rice paper, and shiso leaves, with a tasty yuzu sauce. The sashimi carpaccio features garlic oil, herbs, and seasonings- the crispy garlic in particular added great texture and flavor to the fish! What's not to love?! I am hoping they add more raw fish dishes and light rolls to their menu, their fish is very fresh and great quality. Will come back for sashimi. 

GRILL ITEMS
Various meats on sticks. The chicken thigh is tasty, with a nice char to it. They have a house-made chicken sausage that is fairly unique, and available with a poached egg dipping sauce- didn't much care for it. The offer two types of beef tongue, and the lean version we tried lacked the flavor we expected, seeming more like liver? The kurobata sausage and tomato/bacon are staples that are executed well. Grilled mackerel was the best dish in this section of the menu: simply prepared, crispy skin, moist interior, best with just a squeeze of lemon.

DESSERT
Matcha pannacotta is sublime. Cool, creamy green tea custard features a surprise red bean filling, topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. I prefer desserts that aren't too sweet, and this perfectly fit the bill. Their honey toast seems to be very popular though, and many groups around us ordered it.

Service sitting at the sushi bar was attentive throughout our visit, with constant drink refills and small talk with the sushi chef. The interior space is modern, with both booths and the bar, and loud EDM/House style music, which was an interesting contrast to the simple, classic food. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place, this will definitely be a must go every time I visit Vegas. Any restaurant that reminds me of the food quality in Japan is an A+ in my book. The food tastes authentic and the skewers have a perfect char taste that I love. Service is always great."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I'd have given them 5 Stars. 

Tonight, One. 

Long story short - our unfriendly waitress misunderstands our order, brings us twice as many things as we order, and EVEN AFTER WE CLARIFY and ASK HER TO STOP, CHARGES US FOR THEM.  She argues with us that she brought them and because we ate them, we're paying!  
I have never had a restaurant mistakenly give me the wrong food and then say we're paying for their error!  Especially when we tell her this issue, she says okay, and walks away, leaving the food there!  If the restaurant was going to charge us, you would think they'd take them away??  Not leave them there without a word??

And this is called \"Penny Wise, Pound foolish.\"  Enjoy that little bit of extra money you made from dumping random food off and refusing to acknowledge that YOU made a mistake because in the long run, I will NEVER return to your restaurant.  You are missing out on tons of late night runs with my friends.  And it's a shame because your food is GREAT.   But there are plenty of other places nearby that are just as awesome that will give me quality service that YOU couldn't provide."}
{"text":"Awesome 5 stars for 1/4 the price of those rip off strip hotels!!  New favorite place 5 minutes from condo in Chinatown!  Super friendly chefs and server!  Loved the shitake, enoki, steak grilled, chicken grilled, shashito peppers and seared tuna!"}
{"text":"After multiple times of coming here I can honestly say this is not only one of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown or even Vegas but in the entire country. The service is spot on from the second you walk in the door until you walk out of it consistently. I've noticed that they've had mostly the same servers for awhile and it's a solid staff that really know what they are doing. The owner/sushi chef is there pretty much every time I can remember and serves up some of the best scallop nigiri I've had in the U.S. I generally keep it to the yakitori menu and It's turned out some of the juiciest most flavorful pieces of meat I've ever had. Some stand outs from the yakitori menu are definitely the duck and the wagyu, the tongue is good but ichiza has them beat on that front. When it comes to their dessert they are known for their giant honey toast that whole very good is also sometimes too much after a full dinner and some of their other dessert options are a little weak but their beer and liquor selections are solid and their happy hour flavored sake shots are an extreme deal."}
{"text":"Good for dates, good for a quick eat, good for family- it's a pretty well-balanced restaurant.  Service is great, decor is stunning, everything is just right.  

The reason why I'm giving Hachi 4 stars is because establishments that I give 5 stars to usually have a \"wow, oh holy %^&\" factor that applies to them.  When I gave it to Parasol Up, it was because of the ambiance and crowd it managed to maintain every time I went there.  For Tao, it was the experience I got.  Bradley Ogden, their food.  But here at Hachi, everything is just.. good.  Not great.  Good.

I've been to Hachi many times and as with many restaurants out their, they've catered to our slumbering economy by dumbing down their menu.  They now have a section in the menu that features small, tapas-type dishes for people who aren't too hungry or that on a very strict budget.  The sushi is still very good; they have a sushi roll with mango on top which I think everyone should try... when mango is in season :)"}
{"text":"My mom loves Japanese yakitori, so we came to try this place out. The yakitori options were all very well-done, only wish there was more selection (they only had chicken thigh, wing, and pork(?!) tsukune when we went). It was nice to have such a large menu, though, we also tried a bunch of specials and nothing was a miss. We especially enjoyed the grilled oyster and the paitan ramen (LOVE the thick wavy noodles). Honestly just wish they had more actual yakitori."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant inside the Red Rock casino.  Our waiter was well versed on the menu and quality of each selection we inquired about.  He made several recommendations and each was superb.  When asked if we wanted to Saki we said we didn't like the taste.  He brought us a few samples and to our surprise, they were delicious!  The atmosphere is upscale yet fun and lively."}
{"text":"Very good yakitori and fresh salmon sashimi.  Overall a very good restaurant and I highly recommend this place.  Here are a few tips:
Grilled oysters are pretty small so even $2 seems a bit costly.  Happy hour will lower the price more.
The brick toast is very large portion.  The bread is about 8\" tall and loaded with ice cream so it'll be good to share.  Takes 15-20 minutes to make so order it during mid meal can avoid some wait time.
Chashu bowl is very good and I think kids will love it."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review for Hachi yet?  Weird.  Always a nice place to stop by for sushi.  I really like the S.A.M. roll. Salmon, avocado, and mango with a lemon dipping sauce.  Light and refreshing.  

Food presentation has always been top notch.  Get the sashimi sextet or octet if you want to impress someone.  Beautiful presentation.  

Service has always been good.  The sushi chefs don't do service or interact with the folks at the sushi bar though, which has always been a little weird. Instead, the servers just sneak up from behind.  

We've dined at the bar a few times and that has been nice.  They have some excellent cocktails.  Yummy sushi, good drinks, nice atmosphere.  I dig it."}
{"text":"I was originally going to give this place a 5 star rating, 4 for the food and 1 extra for Joe, the absolutely best bartender when it comes to Customer service. Seriously, this guy took care of us or made sure our server went above and beyond every time we stopped in. 

One star now, because they closed. We were there a month ago and no one gave us a heads up, which tells me it was pretty sudden. Red Rock told me they are putting a new restaurant there but don't know what it will be yet. Even LBS burger right next door knew for months that they would be closing and a Mexican place would be replacing them. 

At least I got the recipe for their kabocha squash soup. 
Now I only wish I knew where Joe is going to work now so we could go there."}
{"text":"I want this place to succeed. And, my rating is not so much for the food, but for the service. Not to mention, when one has overindulged in gambling for more than 6 hours without peeing, while drinking free drinks (and not peeing), they HOPE for some good ass food.

Anyway, we were seated and a waitress (Japanese, of course) came and took our order. But, we were quite perplexed because as we observed throughout our \"experience\", what she really did was pawn off any order or request to someone else (that wasn't Japanese)... So, I am not sure what her function was, other than to impart some cultural something something to the place. Anyway, this made waiting for food unbearable and long.

Food was above average. Spicy scallop hand roll was great, as was the unagi. The tempura is pricy, but actually the best I've ever had (French Beans, Asparagus and carrot)."}
{"text":"We stopped by a Saturday evening around 5:30 right when they were opening. This was unintentional, but turned out to be a good idea as this place gets busy. We were seated quickly by a friendly staff.

The restaurant itself is super nice and comfortable. I immediately felt excited to experience their food.

We primarily ate only grilled skewers. Everything we had was prepared well-timed and was all delicious. The grilling method they use really adds fantastic smokey flavor to their food.

You will definitely have a delicious and satisfying experience here."}
{"text":"Really, no that great.  The sushi was bland and not impressive.  Service was okay, but it also was not impressive.  I have a few local places that have better food for the price."}
{"text":"Hachi is the best Japanese tapas bar in Las Vegas.  The food is delicious and the service is very hospitable and friendly!

Location 5/5
I love the wooden accents and brick walls coupled with the Japanese-inspired booths and tables.  The use of bamboo shoots and plants also brings a nice, natural vibe to the place as well.  Beautiful.

Service: 5/5
I've been here 3 times now and have always received the most friendly and helpful service.  These guys are extremely nice!

Food: 5/5
I absolutely love the grilled squid.  The grilled chicken thighs with the sauce is also delicious m.  Basically anything from the grilled menu is a game-winner with the special coals they use to fuel their grill.  I also really like the chasu here!  Oh, and the honey toast is HUGE!  Be prepared with multiple mouths to feed if you order it.  It's fun to share all kinds of their delicious food with people.

Overall: 5/5
What more can I say?"}
{"text":"This place is okay, not a stunner by any means 'tho.

Disappointing they ran out of their popular \"Black Cod\" dish.

The portions are good sized and fairly priced for a Hotel/Casino restaurant.

If you fear never getting filled at Japanese Sushi restaurants, I'd recommend ordering their Chicken Fried Rice for $10, it's enough to help fill 2 people (or feed more), and then you won't go broke ordering so much sushi, that you're potentially faced with a huge bill and still empty stomach. 

The sushi rolls are okay, nothing spectacular, but then again, I'm not a big fan of those fancy rolls with special names and all sorts of random assortments thrown together.  I'm more of a fan of the basic sushi and sashimi where there's no sauces or blending of multiple flavors, and the quality of the fish can be tasted without distractions.

The service is decent here, as is the decor.  

I'd still rate Nobu at the Hard Rock with higher ratings, 'tho that comes with a higher price tag too.  

I think you can come out of this place for about $100 for dinner for 2 feeling satisfied, and maybe up to $150 if you add alcohol and order a tad more liberally."}
{"text":"A better Japanese restaurant in town. Service is great, the food is great, the atmosphere is great. The one downfall is the parking. This plaza has too many restaurants for the size of the parking lot. Hard to find a space if you go during peak hours."}
{"text":"Hachi is the best Japanese Yakitori place in Town, I had a beef tataki salad, sashimi 6 kinds, tsukune (ground pork) with poached egg that it was sooooo good! and big pieces of chicken karake with house sauce (green onion sauce), Everything was so delicious and service was awesome too. I will come back"}
{"text":"Amazing food, very reasonable prices and outstanding service from the watiresses and staff. I've never been here before but I will be coming back often.

This is what's great: 

Service is top notch
Amazing Japanese decor
Seating isn't cramped 
Great tasting food
Great selection of sake! 
Very clean 
Lighting is perfect
Unique and relaxing Japanese music

Will return for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  3rd time here, so this review isn't based on a one-time experience. 

I'm a well-travelled white guy who knows authentic asian foods. This place is legit as  Japanese Izakaya. There is one person who only attends the grill. Result: perfectly prepared skewers. The sushi chef is very traditional in sushi styles and flavors. 

The restaurant makes their own soy sauce and spices in house. All flavors are subtle and well-balanced. 

Everything is so good that you have to be careful about over-ordering.  Prices are very reasonable for the amazing food quality. 

Service is friendly and comes by often, but never seems to get in the way of our conversations. 

All in all, you should be here right now. I am."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and delicious.  We dined on a Sunday night and it was not crowded.  We had three rolls and there was one with watermelon that was my favorite."}
{"text":"Y'all,  I'm a yuuuuge yakitori fan, but omg. I love this damn place. The outside doesn't look like much but once you get inside...dyammmm. the menu is amazing, the Y-grill is for real....the selection is amazeballs. Service is on point. It's easy to over-order, so be careful!!!! But, you can always take it home, so there's that. Price point is right on, if your in the area, give this place a try. Then do drunk karaoke right across the parking lot. #GreatFind"}
{"text":"this place is on point, and lives up to every bit of the reviews and ratings. 

A small restaurant located off the strip that strangely enough had very few people when i dinned in but that made it even better. The decore and service are all really great and add to the experience as a whole.

One thing that provided hints of a really good restaurant was that the only other patrons that night were japanese..and the wait staff was also japanese. 

The sashimi is fresh, flavorful, and the yakatori is amazing!!! If you are looking for some japanese food this is your place!"}
{"text":"Order the coconut soup, pink elephant role.  Pretty much all good and all expense."}
{"text":"You need to come here!  The essence of Japanese flavor is stunning!  We had tried Raku the night before and Hachi is hands down phenomenal!  If you want a truly gastro nirvana experience for the taste buds,   Hachi will set the new standard for Japanese Izakaya in Vegas!  We had the Halibut Uni carpaccio...indescribable at PG13 which prompted this review....Hachi got us at carpaccio.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!! Literally something for everyone on these menus. Good veggie options! We tried a little of everything, and all was outstanding. We had fried smelt on skewers, yakitori duck, pork, wagyu, mushroom, and bacon wrapped scallops. Seriously, so good! The Hachi miso soup really hit the spot after a long draining day. Excellent variety on the Special Board, including higher quality fish selections. All the sea food we tasted was very fresh and high quality. I'm quite picky about sea food, and this is excellent. 
The service was warm, friendly, helpful with tastey suggestions, and absolutely on point. The atmosphere is cozy while fresh stylish Asian contemporary. Cool music. Immediately upon entering the smells were fresh and intriguing. 
I'm very excited to come back and try more new things!"}
{"text":"Yakitori always hits the spot!  meat on skewers, can't go wrong.

perfect for a cool day with good buddies, ice cold beer, and crispy hot meat sticks.  

love all the chicken skewers: regular chicken thigh with salt or the one with ponzu sauce.  chicken were moist and delicious.  too bad they didn't have chicken cartilage or chicken hearts! 
mochi and bacon was super delicious.  bacon was crispy and the mocha was crispy outside and ooey gooey and chewy.
fish cake and mozzarella cheese was mehhh but cheeeeseeeeee
overall, all the skewers were yum and fun to eat.  
chicken karaage was alright.  crispy, light, fried.
uni sashimi was not worth it at all.  about $15 for 3 tiny pieces of uni.  
hamachi sashimi with jalapeño and ponzu was refreshing and fresh.  definitely a good start to clean the palate."}
{"text":"good sushi, a bit overpriced.  udon was soggy.  tempura wasn't seasoned, just deep fried,and the batter was tasteless.

decor is, um, strange.  one wall of blown up cherry blossom branches, dark woodwork, glass cherry blossoms hung from the ceiling.  one wall is eyeballs.  eyeball wallpaper (they're more cartoonish than real) all the way up.  creepy.  distracting, too.

have to say that our server sucked, too.  he had problems hearing us and had to physically lean over the table to hear my girlfriend's order (for the record, she doesn't have an \"inside voice\" so not being able to hear her is usually not an issue).  

not the place to go if you want an intimate dining experience."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas last Thursday and have dinner here. We lived in Japan for 6 yrs and finding a wonderful Japanese restaurant like this is hard. Everything was great from the food. the beer , the service and ambience."}
{"text":"This is one of two go-to izakaya-style eateries for my wife and I.  Absolutely love, love, love this place.  The kushi are expertly grilled, sashimi/sushi are top quality and fresh, and the service is attentive and friendly.  And for dessert?  You need to try the honey toast...uniquely Japanese and so frickin' delicious.  You know what, now that I'm thinking about this, I am going tonight for dinner."}
{"text":"We came at 630pm and was greeted by a rude Asian lady. She asked if I've any reservation, I said no. She rudely replied \"No reservation, no table... it's Valentine day...maybe 930\".  She could have been more sympathetic instead she gave me that look? We went across to District One and was greeted with a smile and they politely gave us a table with no wait. Hachi just lost my business, I'm local and always in the area...."}
{"text":"Second time at Hachi and we're never disappointed. Must try the chicken thigh with Citron pepper and the seared garlic tuna sashimi."}
{"text":"First time eating sushi at this place and it was a well designed restaurant. Very modern theme throughout the restaurant. 

When entering the Restaurant you are greeted by very attractive hostess that look like they are ready to hit a CLUB...

The sushi was a bit pricey for sushi but i guess its all about presentation. Some of the chief special rolls are good, especially the ones with jalapenos. 

If you can go somewhere else i would, for example an all you can eat. For the price i spent here i could have got all you can eat instead of 3 rolls"}
{"text":"I am really happy to find this place. Their squires are amazing (beef tongues, pork bellys, cheeks, and chicken thighs are absolutely worth it and even for the price. The chicken karaage and seared chasu pork is highly recommended too. Their sashimi and sushi is always fresh and worth the price too. Gotta have their 1 dollar oysters for late night special after 10pm. I am surprised that this place is not known much in Vegas but give some time. One of the best local Japanese restaurants I have been to that I recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Good but not Raku great

Pretty standard dishes.

Had too many dishes to write about

All yakitori was good

Their agedashi tofu is good

But overall coming from out of town I wouldn't come here on vacation.

Nothing memorable.

Great service and high quality food.  But pretty uninteresting."}
{"text":"If you want good food, great atmosphere and authentic flavors then Hachi is a must try. They have delicious yakitori and sushi. Everything is fresh and authentic. It almost feels like you got transported to Tokyo even though you are in Vegas. Definitely order their yakitori and items on the special menu. I am not a fan of chicken skin but their chips was delicious. They also have a mountain potato chips which is a must order. I loved their hachi salad and the raw scallops special. 

The staff is super friendly. Make reservations because this place gets packed!! We did not have room for dessert but we saw another table order the brick toast. It looked impressive. 

Will be back to try more items. This place does not disappointment. The friends we were with loved it so much they came back the following night with their friends for dinner."}
{"text":"one of the best meals I've had in my life! I've had grilled skewers at other japanese restaurants, but this place blows them away! Everything we ordered was amazing. Not too often you find a place where so many things from the menu are all consistently delicious. Already planning on when I can come back. Didn't even get a chance to try the sushi, because the other food was so damn good."}
{"text":"Went with friends and we ordered the Fried Rice, BBQ Baby Back Ribs, Shrimp Tempura, Veggie Tempura Plate, Formula One Roll, Plus more....... Oh my was that good!!!"}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked on my yelp for awhile now and finally decided to give this place a try 

I came in around 11pm and was greeted right away and seated I always choose to sit at a table I'm not a big van of the bar 

They have happy hour starting at 10 :) 

I ordered two items off there daily special menu the oyster and the grilled oyster and the seared garlic tuna both were delicious I've never had a grilled oyster but I was very pleased

I also ordered the jalapeño yellowtail carpaccio this was my favorite I loved all the flavors together yummy 

I ordered some beef as well which was yummy but it wasn't super amazing 

I would come back the price is great I was full and spent only about 40$"}
{"text":"GET OFF THE STRIP and ENJOY!
A new little izakaya that stands alone right across from District 1 and opened in early August 2015!  The decor is inviting and comfortable from the minute you walk-in.  The focus of the restaurant centers around the kitchen as the seating area encircles the cooks and the bar area.

The food emphasis is on small tapas type dishes ranging from classic Japanese yakitori skewers, grilled seafood...to a variety of carpaccio dishes.  I would say that you have try a few things from the authentic Japanese charcoal grill.  The grilled items have a smoky taste that is unlike anything else that you will find in general at most places.  They use a specially imported Japanese charcoal that imparts great flavour to the food.

They have other typical items of sashimi, katsu's, and other ramen/donburi but you should really start with their specialties first and fill up toward the end should you need.

Don't forget to look at their alcohol menu as they have many different sakes and sochus that are bound to fit your taste.

Service is great and very attentive.  My water glass was never empty and I was drinking constantly during this summer heat.  Servers were also very available a moments notice when called upon.

So everyone should try this new izakaya and enjoy a little taste of Tokyo.  And don't forget to try at least ONE of their yummy desserts!!!

On a scale of 8 (8 being the best), I give this one a \"Hachi!\""}
{"text":"I have to say I was happily surprised by this restaurant. I live in the area and have gone to Red Rock but had never eaten @ hachi. I assumed that it was another sushi joint and the food would be just ok, and the drinks over priced but I was wrong.

I would give the scene 4.5 stars, super sexy not what you would expect from a stations restaurant.

Service - 4.5  We were seated right away and there was no pretentious attitude - so I was a fan of that. Our server was super friendly and very helpful with suggestions. After dinner we sat at the bar for a night cap and both bartenders were very quick to make recommendations and knew there stuff.

The food & drinks - 5 plus Everything we had was ridiculously good. We had about four different rolls (LSD, Smack, g13 , Little sumpin) all super good, inventive. Drinks- Girl had the pink lotus- looked kinda like a chick drink but tasted amazing, cool presentation ( poured alcohol thru cotton candy to make drink). I had the velvet revolver, if u have ever had a really good cucumber vodka martini. Trust me this is so much better, really balanced with and has a bit of heat at the end ( think it has Sirachha or tobasco in it).

Overall the whole experience was amazing **"}
{"text":"Food was decent but not worth the price. Had lobster tacos which were good, but only four bites. Also had the x roll which was awful from conception to execution and it was $16. I spent 40+ tip but will head to pinks because I am still hungry."}
{"text":"Opened just late last year, Hachi Las Vegas is still finding its  customer base - on this past Saturday night, it was only a quarter full, and the sushi / kushiyaki bar area was empty.

It deserves much better.

The service was excellent - polite, sweet, friendly.  One small suggestion to the manager and BOH - slow the kushiyaki down just a little.  Kushiyaki is meant to be eaten hot, fresh off the grill. When they are spaced as they are - not all together, but too tightly spaced sequentially - the guests can't really enjoy the previous skewer without the next skewer getting cool.

Nearly every kushiyaki item we ordered was excellent, on par with the best I've found in LA and better than most. 

A large part of my happiness with the kushiyaki items was due to their use of bintochan to grill...

The fish sashimi and uni dishes were very good, not quite excellent. Certainly better than good enough for those who like raw seafood instead of or in addition to the grilled items, but it was not destination sushiya level.

The decor was great, with an authentic Japanese izakaya meets modernist US west coast feel to it.

I really enjoyed my experience here and I greatly hope they find their fan base; it is a worthy addition to the area, with the superlative Raku just down the street and so many great Asian and especially Taiwanese places nearby, in Las Vegas Chinatown. 

I look forward to stopping by whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hachi isn't a hopping happy hour joint like nearby Yardhouse but they have good deals like $3 Sapporo and $6 sake-tinis. A lot of food items are under $8 and you have to try their bbq baby back ribs. Sweet, saucy and to die for. Unfortunately, my order came in literally an hour later and I had to bug the bartender a few times to see what's up. Baby needs her ribs. Ergo, Hachi gets bumped down to a mere 3 stars for service lacking."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in vegas, all food we ordered were fresh and delicious.  So glad we decided to skip bacchanal and go with high quality yakitori dining.  Food came out fast and the waitress was attentive to all out needs.  Mushroom wrapped with bacon was excellent, all carpaccio, beef tataki and yellowtail uni were pefect. We preferred our skewers salted vs with sauce.  
Overall I definitely recommend and would stop by if in town again."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chicken karage in Vegas.  Went here for dinner last Friday with my son and wife and we loved it. Being from San Diego, we have been looking for an izakaya spot that was like Tajima 2. This is closest, thus far.  

They have a great selection of Sake and Soju. They also have beer and wine. If you don't finish it, put your name on it and save it for when you return. Love that.

As I mentioned the chicken karage  is even better than Tajima's and closer to some of the ones in Guam or Japan.  The Yakatori selections are delicious. The grilled New York steak was good but I wish they added a Japanese seasoned butter to it. (Maybe one day)  

The ambiance is unassuming by looking at it from the outside and is very nice. The service was very good.  It is safe to say that we will be frequenting here even though we live in Henderson. So many more things to try like the ramen and more yakatori, hamchi kama and etc... 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is from 5p-7p. Bottomless mimosas, bellinis, and champagne/chambord is only for $8!!!

The rolls are VERY TASTY. I had the TOP 6 which was phenomenal; basically you get a sample of their 6 best rolls in the house in one plate. This is the best way to taste 6 different rolls at the same time without having to pay for 6 full rolls and without costing you a grip of money along the way!

The Pink Elephant was really good it is comparable to the yama crunch roll at Yama Sushi, is the best way I can describe it. 

Here is the Hachi Menu if you are interested in viewing what they have:

The place is a little on the pricey side. I spent $60 bucks and felt like I had appetizer only. =P"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Good food, good decor and good chill atmosphere. For me, skewers are the best things to get here - great taste. Will go back soon and recommend."}
{"text":"So many great sushi options in Vegas, but Hachi will not disappoint. Their prices are very reasonable and the quality is exceptional. The service was good too.

I recommend the $1 late night oysters, anything with uni, toro nigiri, and their seared salmon belly nigiri! The chef is awesome!"}
{"text":"My second time here, the ambiance is nice and quiet and romantic.  Some of the potlights are a little bright, which could cause a headache. 

We chose to sit at the bar this time, so we could see some of the chefs at work.  

They have a daily special menu, with discounted items which was awesome. The day we went there was sweet shrimp nigiri, and choice of fried shrimp head or miso soup (add $1.00). It's only one per person, so we tried the fried head, and it was so crispy.  You could eat everything. The nigiri was very fresh, kept me wanting more! Each piece including the fried head was only 2.50.

We ordered some skewers, chicken thigh, tskune, pork cheek, beef.  They were all very juicy and had a nice aroma.  Their blend of house soya sauce was very tasty and not too salty.  

We had the other daily special which was a baked clam (2 pieces), the presentation was very nice, but the clam meat was a little salty, perhaps because of the natural habitat of salt water. 

We tried fried oyster (2 pieces) and this was very nice and juicy.  The outer layer was really crispy with a silky texture inside. 

Fried chicken skin, this was really yummy.  Nice starter, great crisp, and a squeeze of lemon cuts the saltiness. 

Takowasabi, this had a good Wasabi flavour and crunch. 

Yamakeke, we got this last time too because we really liked it.  It's mountain yam with tuna sashimi chunks, salmon roe. The mountain yam is very gooey and has an interesting slimy texture with a touch of crunch.  We mixed it together with their house blend soya sauce.  They put a bit of Wasabi to mix in, and this gave it such a nice kick!! 

Definitely will want to come back and try other dishes next time. We were on a time restraint to catch our plane!!! 

The prices are very reasonable for great quality of food.  Service was great and attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent! My new favorite late-night Japanese! Hachi ranks up there with Raku in quality and presentation but won't necessarily bust your budget like Raku will. Went there twice in one week, it's that good! Try the blue point oysters if they're on special with the fresh wasabi! Go go go!"}
{"text":"Its my third time here within a week cause this place is really good!!! GREAT customer service!! Everyone is friendly!! They serve the food pretty fast and great price too!!Drinks are pretty cheap also!! I will def. keep coming back here! :)"}
{"text":"I finally, FINALLY tried this place out. 
The employees were very very nice and attentive and there was too much to choose from on the menu. 
Everything that was ordered was really good so I have no complaints on that. Well.. Just a fair warning but if you order the honey toast, it's going to require 3 people. It is also more drenched in honey than other places so prepare for the sweetness. 
The music was good (to me), and my sister was literally Shamzaming every single song that came up. Even the bathroom was like a party! We came in at night, that's why but it made my first experience so much better. 
I'll be coming back (:"}
{"text":"Oyakodon and Magic Mountain are delicious! Restaurant is small and it's got a nice ambiance:)"}
{"text":"Everything was and still is great! You won't regret going here. Servers were friendly, the japanese chef (not sure) was meticulous and a little perfectionist when preparing food (watched how he made my sashimi roll, twas neat) yakitori was really good. You should try it! Triple thumbs up to the people who work here who continuously make  every effort just to make everyone feel overly satisfied with their choice to dine here! 

Brought every family and friend visiting vegas and as always, they are impressed!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Japanese food ! At a good price :) 
My Japanese mama & I sat by the bar which was nice because the chef asked what we liked and customized the dishes for us . We started with a couple pickled dishes and salads then ordered the sashimi plate , chicken skewers , fried shrimp, grilled oyster, toro sushi . Everything was super flavorful - my new fav Japanese spot !"}
{"text":"This place was so disappointing.  I was staying at the red rock resort for business and craving sushi.  

We were seated right away but then it went downhill from there.  The drink and app orders were taken right away.  It then took at 15 minutes to receive the drinks.   I had asked for warm saki, when she brought the drinks it was cold.  It was then another 10 minutes for a new saki.  

We ordered the LSD roll (the only good roll we received), Cali roll (meh), veggie tempura roll (so greasy), and some roll with about 15 different things on it that just wasn't very good.

The waitress was rarely seen and took a long time to receive the the over-inflated check.  If you want good sushi, head somewhere else."}
{"text":"The grilled squid was grilled perfectly. A good option if you are looking for a robata other than roku."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service could be better and chefs were outstanding. We had a party of 7 plus 2 babies. The staff are absolutely accommodating. Thank you"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Service is consistently good, friendly, helpful. I really like their skewers, their different salts that accompany the skewers, and atmosphere is fun and modern yet still reminiscent of old school Japanese craftsmanship. Their dessert was okay. The chef from the bar area came over to say hi to different tables."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here last night for a date night. We've been wanting to check out an Izakaya forever now, and figured based on reviews that Hachi was the place!

The atmosphere is intimate and all of the staff was welcoming. We decided to sit at the bar as to not take up any four top tables. I'm glad we sat at the bar because it felt like a much better experience.
We ordered a couple of Kirins and perused the three menus. One was a nightly specials menu, one was an appetizer dinner, and the last was their full menu. 

We began with the crispy rice appetizer, bacon wrapped tomatos, and a scallop and sea urchin crudo. Everything gave out super fast and all of the ingredients tasted very fresh. 

We went super fat kid mode and ordered the following:
Wagyu tongue misozuke
Pork cheek
Duck
Pork belly
Beef tataki
Kurobuta sausage
Seared garlic tuna nigiri
Chicken karaage 
Honey toast (to finish the night off)

Overall I had an incredible experience and it made for an awesome date night. Sitting at the bar was fun because we would get all of our food handed over the counter to us as soon as it was finished on the charcoal grill. I would definitely recommend coming to Hachi for an authentic Izakaya experience."}
{"text":"Since I stay at the Red Rock when I go to Vegas, I often see the restaurants and partake in them.  This time I stopped by Hachi to pick up some take-out dinner since we arrived late and the wife had to tend to the baby while I foraged for food.  Sounds very cromagnon.  I love it.

Well, it wouldn't have been bad if not for the price.  For two rolls and a sashimi plate (the 10 piece), it cost me a pretty $55.  That's ridic no matter how you slice it - and considering that it was a casino who wanted to pull my away from my hard-earned money, you'd think they'd cut the food down a bit to keep me there.  But no.

We ate and weren't displeased with the sushi - of course, it could have been better.  But if we wanted authentic, then perhaps we should have gone to Chinatown and eaten in a Japanese restaurant rather than a casino.  But if you're in a pinch and are ready for the price tag, then go here for some sushi and you'll walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"People are very courteous and friendly. The place is cozy and clean. Menu selections had a wide variety and was very affordable. I recommend the sashimi salad to start your meal."}
{"text":"Do you think it perverse that I gave this SUSHI restaurant four stars based on their preparation of a vegetable. They must have the director or Cirque Du Soleil back there because I swear to the heavens their broiled eggplant tasted like the rich goodness that is pork belly. You get 6 or 8 uniformly cut, lava-hot, pieces of eggplant that melt in your mouth after you crunch and chew away the perfectly caramelized corners.

I forgot the rest of the meal and I order 3 other things. I would defo come back for this scrumptious little night shade."}
{"text":"Still labeling this place as \"a-ok\" but not a stand out.

Sake bombed here with 5 friends. Ate some decent sushi, had one horrendously bad roll, but it was my fault for ordering it.

It was dinner, no great shakes."}
{"text":"I enjoy Nasu Dengaku (grilled eggplant with special miso sauce on top), Sashimi Octet (8 different types of fresh premium sashimi/ 2 pic each), and 8-ball rolls (Soft Shell crab inside, and yellow tail  and avocado outside). I like the fact that you can order shrimp tempura by the piece.
If you are not sure what to order, try vegetable fried rice. ( Shitake mushroom, edamame, fried tofu, carrot,  onion, scallion, and sesame seeds on top)
Hachi has fresh ingredients and servers are knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Please try all kinds of fishes here, they have very buttery salmon sashimi. It tastes fresh and sweet in your bites
Authentic rolls with no sauces rolls. I highly recommend yakitori skewers but it will be pricey. 
Good takoyaki with sauce. Oysters are fresh as well"}
{"text":"Delicious meal. I was looking for a late night mea and Hachi came up big. I had some dumplings and a chicken and rice bowl. Both were tasty and perfect for a late night drinking hangover cure. Hachi is a great late night dining destination for Asian food."}
{"text":"Ever since I've had an obsession for pork belly skewers from Kyara, it started an ongoing search for more places similar to their standards or better. 

Welp, I found a place. Hachi is amazing! I'm not subjected ONLY to pork belly skewers, I love a variety. So their JUICY CHICKEN KAARAGE is top knotch!! I love love kaarage and when I go to japanese restaurants, I always have to have a side of kaarage. This place is probably the best karaage I've had in vegas so far! I also have an obsession for Kurobuta sausage and its so good here also! Sashimi was fresh which is always a must. Place is very inviting and ambience is typical low dimmed light japanese decor which is always cute. I finished my meal with their honey toast. You can never go wrong with honey toast!

It'll definitely be a hard decision between Kyara and Hachi when it comes down to my favorite style of izakaya food. But hey, more options are better than none!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here and this place is pretty amazing. I feel bad because I can't remember names. I know one of them is Lou and the other one was Justin? Service is great here, very friendly. Amazing tapas and their home made soy sauce and paste is a must try with the food they offer.

To give you some perspective, imagine Ichiza, but a lot fancier. So much fancier. 

Now all their meat is fresh. Everything is FRESH, so they will run out of the popular items towards the end of the night so try to get here when they open! 

Tsukune is also a must try and for dessert, the honey toast is massive, so ask for extra plates and forks to share!"}
{"text":"I have always gone to sushi joints and when my fiance wanted to try this place, I was a little worried. Hachi is a very sophisticated restaurant without the dress code. The food always smells and tastes amazing! My favorite 3 would be the cheese chikuwa, oyakodon, and tamagoyaki! They are instant comfort foods! I also love the lychee sours! As someone who can't find a sweet drink without a million things is super hard! With this drink, I cannot taste any alcohol but it's a great feel good drink that won't get you drunk on the first glass.

We moved away from Hachi sadly, but luckily it is on our way home!! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some amazing Japanese food and who's looking for a place that doesn't just serve sushi!"}
{"text":"salmon skin handroll=only gross thing here--had some kind of inidan curry-like powder mixed in it was really bad.

Lobster wontons=crisp, tasty, delicious appetizer with an out of this world corn-mango-onion salsa woooow. 4 small pcs I could down a few dozen of these (easy boy)

Chef gave us complimentary chilean sea bass sushi 2pcs with tempura outside was great.

Cold kirin light in chilled mug, very smooth

Shrimp fried rice---this aint your panda express garbage...one of the best dishes I have ever eaten anywhere in my life, that good. A must to order.
$16 bucks its like a main course and awesome.

Yellowtail, tuna and salmon butter lettuce wraps---sick, sooo goood.

All sushis are great, appetizers leave you twitching and begging for more
A great dining option that I am still having withdrawals from.
Very fresh sushi, $8 appetizers superbly crafted and tasty.

Order the G-13 roll, its got tuna, chopped tomato, cilantro touch, wrapped and hand-cut drizzled with a sour cream like sauce, freakin heavenly

Do yourself a favor, even if you are on the strip, pick up the phone, make reservations AND EAT HERE!!!!

I wish the bar wasnt blocked-off with a slab of red stuff so we could see the master chefs preparations
Ate like 2 horses paid $110 including tip, alcohol, appetizers and that impossibly good flied lice.

Yes its dim, but not noisy I'll take that combo any day."}
{"text":"Great Japanese restaurant in Chinatown. I wanted Oyako-Don. I did a search and this place popped up.
The wife and I went after work one night and we were not disappointed. The oyako-don was excellent. My wife had the charsu bowl both were excellent. We also ordered karage chicken. Very tasty. We'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"This was my first sushi experience and it was very delicious!

All the rolls were very fresh and tasty, but a little too expensive for my taste.  My favorite appetizer was the green bean tempura.

The staff here are top-notch

The atmosphere/decorations are very hip and the place looked brand new it was so clean."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I am picky about my Sushi.  This place is the bomb.  My new go to place in Las Vegas.  Extensive menu, but a total local place with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"38 for under $8 is the way to go! i brought my mom here for a nice dinner and we ordered: tea, veggie fried rice, LSD roll, crab salad, chicken dumplings, edamame, veggie tempura, and beef skewers for $57. 

the servings are very generous and not what you would expect for a classy place like this one. if you are used to dropping a grip for the atmosphere and presentation, you will get more bang for ya buck here. 

troy was our server and was supa sweet! great personality, attentive, informative, and a comedian. actually, come to think about it, everyone was really great. =) 

i am definitely looking forward to heading back for some mo' LSD roll, that shiz is good!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend, was initially skeptical since it's in s strip mall.  However once you step in, you're immediately greeted like family.  We sat at the sushi bar.  The service was outstanding and they clearly work as a team.  The manager was quick to come over and provide recommendations.  The food was fresh and WOW, so tasty!!!  Will definitely tell my friends... Will definitely be back.  

Recommend: 
Tsukune with poached egg.  
1/2 shell oysters were fresh!  
Carpaccio"}
{"text":"Almost managed to try half of the items yakitori menu and a few hot and cold appetizer. I can say without a doubt, \"no regrets!\"
Make sure you make a reservation for dinner on the weekend! We didn't because it was our first time there but got lucky there was a few spot at the sushi bar. 
Definitely a new favorite for us in Vegas, affordable and NOT on the strip."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! Really friendly people and phenomenal food, definitely one of the better Japanese places in Vegas. The interior is also very sleek. Not cheap but that's to be expected.

I can't remember much else since it was so long ago that I came here, but see my photos!"}
{"text":"I came by myself late night, ordered 50 dollars worth of food and asked for more White rice half way through my meal AND THEY CHARGED me for another additional bowl of rice! never been to a Japanese restaurant so cheap. I just ordered 50 bucks worth of food, including a bowl of rice, then you proceed to charge me for another half filed bowl of rice! ridiculous.... not coming back. if you can't even value my business to refill my rice then I'll go else where."}
{"text":"We LOVE HACHI!! 
This has become the once a week place I take my middle son for alone time. We both love sashimi! At an AYCE lunch price of 20 bucks, extremely friendly individuals & fresh fish, you cannot say no!!!
I'm not a huge salmon fan but their baked salmon roll is delicious!! I also love the super white sushi with garlic ponzu!!
The red tiger roll & the Mona Lisa roll (ask for super white tuna instead of the spicy tuna), it's SO YUMMY!!
 We have become regulars here & its heart warming to see that they recognize you when you walk in.
They know exactly what we like now.
Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Everything was delicious! This is my second time being here. I ordered yellowtail jalapeño carpaccio with ponzu sauce, amazing!!! I also ordered Uni, pretty pricey ($4.25 for just 1 piece) but it was on point of course! Very sweet and buttery! I can't live without uni!!!! My boyfriend ordered some yakitori, the Wagyu beef tongue is very juicy! Love this place but I won't come here for a while cause it's a little over price"}
{"text":"Delicous! Gracious and friendly service. Tastiest yakitori. Amazing charcoal flavor. A varied and tasty menu of Japanese deliciousness. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Uuuggghhh. They haven't changed, but the have. For the worse. The BEST part of Hachi was the 38 for under $8 deal they had. No more, saaaay goodbye, it's gone. Some of the items from that special menu, are still on the \"regular\" menu now, and for the same price...yaaaaay!!! But the service is still horrible. I really should have capitalized horrible. So, against my better judgement, we came here last night. Big sign as you walk in. Happy hour daily. I guess I misunderstood daily meaning every day. Waiter tells me it's only at the bar and it's only Sunday through Thursday. SMH. We look over the menu and nothin catches our eyes so we decide to go yardhouse. As we leave, waiter says \"don't you want to enjoy our happy hour specials\"?  This coming from the guy that told us we had to sit at bar, and they didnt have Saturday happy hour. The food is really good. I've tried a bunch of stuff and it is GOOD. But service is a HUGE partof the experience and in this they lack. Big time. They clearly don't care about customer service and i guess they think they are on the strip (which they arent) with the prices they charge!!!! Save yourself time, money and aggrevation and go to Chinatown for some good Japanese."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is cool and modern but not as over-the-top as many of their competitors on the strip. The hostesses seemed a little aloof and not very inviting, but after being seated the staff we met were very friendly and made our dining experience a pleasure. My wife and I ate here early on a Friday night with our 18-month old son (yeah, we're that obnoxious couple that brings our toddler into a fine-dining restaurant with us). A lot of places will make you feel like you're not welcome if you bring a kid with you but our waiter didn't. He was nice, knowledgeable, and provided good service all night. Both he and the sommelier made some good recommendations for food and sake.

Some of the items we tried were the \"sumpin' sumpin'\" roll, cougar roll, marijane roll, and the yellowtail sashimi. All were amazing! Everything tasted fresh and melted in our mouths. The only disappointment of the night was the pan fried chilean seabass cake, which was lacking in flavor and had the texture of a grocery store crabcake. In my opinion the food here is better than most of the japanese restaurants I've been to, with the exception of Nobu (the executive chef at Hachi trained under Nobu by the way). And better yet the price of our dinner was about a third of what we paid at places like Nobu and Yellowtail. This is a modern japanese restaurant so they do have a lot of Americanized food (rolls, etc.), so if that's a turn-off for you you may not be as impressed as I. Hachi made a great impression on me and I'll definitely be back several times."}
{"text":"New Japanese style Izakaya sure to become  a go to gem. 
The style is authentic to the traditional Izakaya in Japan. 
The staff is very friendly. The service is top and on their game. 
Water glass never went empty. 
The food is very good and you should go outside your comfort zone by ordering something you would not regularly do.
Personally not a big fan of yamaimo but the dish that had it was very well prepared and pleasing."}
{"text":"OMG! this restaurant will be on my Favorite list. My bf and I went here for the first time last night and we absolutely loved it. 

I like the decor and we sat at one of the booths. The booths are intimate and comfortable.

There was a wide array of food such as hot and cold appetizer, salad, sashimi, Yakitori, Ramen, etc. I noticed there were Daily Specials and Happy hour I think at 9pm Oysters are for $1. The sake menu was extensive as well.

The food didn't take too long so that's good. We loved everything we ordered -
Ika Karaage (Deep Fried Squid), Juicy Chicken Karaage (Deep fried chicken thigh, outside in crispy, juicy inside), Seared Albacore carpaccio topped with red onion and chive, Crispy Chips, Pork Belly, Pork Cheek, and Passion Sushi Rolls. The food were fresh and scrumptious.

Splendid atmosphere, quick and attentive staff, impressive quality food and an all round great dining experience."}
{"text":"Red Rocks attempt at modern Japanese is not a total failure, but their reverse happy hour falls short of impressive due to a lack of consistency in their offerings as well as a lack of drink choices.

Of what we had, one was borderline terrible while the other was quite tasty. Their mini ramen for 8 dollars is truly mini. One could easily devour all of the ingredients in two bites or so, if one felt the need to do so. The truffle flavor is non existent and the bowl I had was so incredibly bland I didnt want to eat anymore. After adding two shots worth of soy sauce, there was barely enough of a salt flavor to make it edible. On both value and scale, it was a miserable disappointment.

On the other hand, the 808 Fried Chicken was well textured and had a nice balanced sweet and salty flavor. If anything was wrong, it was just a tad salty but perhaps only because of the stark contrast to the ramen.

Having only sake bombs and bunny bombs for reverse happy hour seemed like a poor variety. I had just had higher hopes for this place's reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I had a bunch of really good rolls. Everything was presented pretty awesome. I noticed in the back you could sit japanese style on the floor which would of been really cool. The decor was awesome. Every ones meal was presented very well and looked awesome. The people that I was with all said that it was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow? what a great find.

Walked in and expeced a vegas style Japanese restaurant. Was surprised to discover a really traditional Japanese restaurant with home made miso and amazing rolls.

Nice place and great price!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! From presentation to service to ... Absolutely yummy fresh well prepared dishes! Best green tea, actually brewed not from a tea bag, big difference right there! They were very accommodating to my special needs and answering my question about use of GMOs in their kitchen! My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"New fav Japanese restaurant in Vegas! Get the French bean tempura to start, great alternative to the usual edamame. The lobster tacos are also a great small bite. We had the s.a.m. Roll which came with a lemony vinaigrette, the Hachi roll and the white lotus roll. Everything was so flavorful and so original."}
{"text":"Excellent Yakitori Izakaya place!! Compared to NY, LA and Japan, this place is pretty comparable or better. Highly recommended!! Very good price!! 

Food: 5stars
Interior:4.5stars
Service: 4.5 stars
Price: 5 stars"}
{"text":"Went back to hachi and it was amazing As usual . The service is A++++ the servers are always very happy and on point . I think this is my top top Japanese tapas place in town . 
 Seared garlic tuna- is very good melt in your mouth . 
Wagyu yakitori - buttery and great flavor 
Grilled oyster - really good flavor
Assorted tempura - lots of different tempuras really good 
Everything we had was very flavorful and done the right way ."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times so far and it's my new favorite izakaya restaurant in town. The service and ambience are great. Some of the stand out items are:

Beef Tataki
Seared Garlic Tuna Carpaccio
Yakitori - pork cheek, wagyu beef tongue, bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, and beef intestines
Seared salmon nigiri

The parking can be difficult so it might not be a bad idea to Uber or carpool."}
{"text":"Overall great service, great food and selections, great atmosphere, and great prices.  I had nothing to complain about.  My waiters were on it and very polite.  Food selection was good and we enjoyed their happy hour selection. I had a lychee flavored alcoholic drink, and it was delicious!  My favorite skewers were the pork belly and the beef intestines.  I tried the matcha panna cata and the honey toast.  This made me feel like I was in Tokyo again.  Couldn't have asked for more."}
{"text":"Who knew there could be good sushi in the desert?  Hachi does it right.  The service is great, and both the waiter and the chefs were extraordinary in accomodating my gluten free needs. Kobe beef sashimi is worth it. Peyote roll is delish. Even the cucumber salad is fancy. This is one thing I don't want to stay in vegas.  Sure, it's pricy for sushi when I consider the normal prices for things on the east coast where fish is easy to come by, but this is one place I would definitely come back to during my next Vegas visit. Unexpectedly great, which is the main reason they get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great services. Waitresses consistently checked our table, very efficient and professional.  

We ordered grilled wagyu beef tongue and pork cheek, it was juicy and tasty. Beef tataki salad was a ok, a bit too saucy & salty. House special chicken karake was disappointing, the chicken was dry and no flavor; the dipping sauce should be ponzu sauce base however, all I tasted was sesame  oil.  

Parking is super easy, park inside the plaza parking lot."}
{"text":"It's grad to relate the food fairly because the service was so bad!!!   I went with a friend after being told there was a 45 minute wait at the near empty restaurant next door.    We were seated right away and my dining partner said she hadn't eaten all day and needed food fast.  The exact opposite happened.   It took forever to order and then we waited and waited and waited.   The table next to us arrived later and when they got their food there was quite a lot.   I noticed they got exactly what we ordered.   We talked to them and it turns out they didn't order it and just dug right in.   It also turned out that the waiter gave them our food in addition to their order.  By the time we flagged down the waiter both of us were hungry and cranky!   We could have waited in the non-existent line next door and been served faster.    It took about an hour to get my sashimi and it was a monstrosity!!   Not in terms of quantity but one of the worst presentations I've seen!   Huge bowl if ice with stuff sticking out of it like a partially complete flower arrangement .  Food was just so so for both of us.   We were offered a dessert to share for the inconvenience.   It was particularly bad and I didn't eat it.    Needless to say, I won't be going back"}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  I particularly like the chicken kushiyaki, as well as the LDS rolls.  I think the value on their $8 menu is excellent - and also their happy hour has some very good prices on drinks.  The servers tend to be extremely friendly.  Often, the manager will say hello, I get the impression that they really care about the quality of peoples experiences.  This is seldom found in many restaurants.  Also, the decorum is really nice.

On occasion, service can be a little slow, which is why I ranked this place 4 stars instead of 5.  It is sort of hit-or-miss regarding speed.  That said, it is a terrific place if your in the mood for Japanese food with a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Murano glass everywhere.  Very unique design with many different areas to sit and eat. Very relaxing and comforting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the flavors not just some ordinary Japanese Restuarant, the ambiance and customers service is always on point."}
{"text":"Request the hamachi kama (not on the menu) so good!!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food volume was good for the price. Food quality was fair. The atmosphere was intimate: if you're into that thing. Personally, I think there are better food on spring mountain but can't match the atmosphere or price. Had two beers and a massive amount of food and it was only 60 bucks."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Japanese Tapas restaurant. I must say that it was a delightful evening with my coworkers. Ambience was great, service was super fast and attentive and food was simply delicious. For those uninitiated like me, make sure to ask for suggestions. I had a seared pork chashu and was divine. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Words cannot explain my happiness on my dining experience at Hachi. Let me first start stating that I did not get any special treatment, nor I am a repeating customer. I have been to a few other more expensive izakayas in the area as well. Me and my gf walked in on a Monday night at around 10:30pm, ordered water and some food from the menu, and to my surprise, everything was shockingly delicious. This is a traditional style izakaya, more than enough for anyone to come in for a drink and some yakitori. Definitely try anything on the yakitori menu, with salt, I am so touched, I am writing this review as We are sitting here and waiting for the desert. I could feel love coming from these dishes, and this is not something I say   Lightly, nor often. This is going to be our spot for Vegas now."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decore is fantastic. 

Lychee martini is five star and at 12$ it's not supernovae priced. 

The beans are a must order 

The kimbucha soup was good

The mushroom salad was below average
as well as our tofu rice noodle large dish,  especially for 18$.

I believe that there are better restaurants at Red rock."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Found hachi on yelp. Glad I came here but was surprised to see it slow on a weekend night. Great service and the food comes out quickly. I just kept ordering whatever sounded good. The specials were great. We had the sweet shrimp (wish was fresh and not frozen according to my sushi chef friend) and wagyu as specials. Also got ramen to wash it all down. Ordered a dozen more meats. The miso is great to add as flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool, but service left something to be desired.  Had to flag down a manager to ask why nobody has tended to us after being there for 15 minutes.  At the sushi bar no less!

Food was good, but not outstanding, and definitely overpriced.  What do you expect for being inside of a hotel in Vegas, huh?  With so many good sushi options in town, doubt I'll be back too often.  Sorry, Hachi."}
{"text":"F@&!NG Love it. They are so attentive and alway checking up on you. All my orders are timely delivered and of ever they had a delay they will tell you. All sake at beer and Shots are awesome( yes I tried them all) my wife loves every food that I ordered for her. All the staff are aware and focus for you and to you only when ur talking to them.

And yeah I know they have a not so big table, but trust me, they will make sure that when ur done, they will take care of your plates so that you have space for move AWESOME food!!!!  Just saying, don't believe some of the low star that gave a review here, probably they were just HANGRY. ^_^ (right now I am drunk but it doesnt mean I am lying about my review.) LMAO"}
{"text":"Hachi is still the best in Las Vegas! Was here last night after being away for a while during all of the holidays.. Glad to reconnect. Some great new items.. A Japanese eggplant grilled yakitori was an amazing addition.. I had their Sukiyaki for the first time and it was absolutely awesome. The Yellowtail Jalapeno special roll was awesome as usual and if you are lucky enough to have Yumi as your server she is the nicest server you will ever find anywhere. A great find in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this spot based on the reviews of some of my Yelp friends.  I started off with some warm, salted edamame.  That's warm and salted.  Very tasty.  Then I had the spicy kabocha coconut soup with pumpkin seeds.  A most flavorful soup and I'll be back if only for the soup!!!  I followed this up with the vegetable tempura plate - a melange of broccoli, pumpkin, avocado, asparagus, zucchini, onion, and shiitake mushroom.  The vegetables were ever so lightly coated and the dipping liquid was superb! 

How could I leave without trying a roll?  I couldn't so I ordered the kholester roll, which according to the menu is kimchee and cream cheese stuffed jalapeno tempura.  It was also very good.

Dessert you ask?  How could I?  I went to have a light meal and ended up eating like a sumo. But it was so worth it!  Thanks, Misti!

Note:  the edamame is not complimentary as it is at most Japanese places."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Yakitori fan. I visit Vegas twice a year and I make sure to eat here every night no matter where I'm staying. If you like Yakitori this is a must!The owner of this restaurant is truly a master of his craft."}
{"text":"The food is decent but this place is really, really loud.  I do not like going here on date night because I cannot hear my wife.

The food is salty or sugary, but still tastes good; it's nothing special though.

We go here maybe four times a year; not a bad place before catching a flick at the red rock regal cinema."}
{"text":"It's been exactly 2 years since I wrote a review for Hachi and updated review is much needed. Hachi has grown on me over the years and I've come to really like this place. 

Their service is 10/10 every time. They are attentive, knowledgeable, professional and extremely polite. Back in Japan these type of service is the norm but that's not the case in US unfortunately. I liked that both chefs and servers genuinely care about their customers. You can just see it in their eyes when they greet everyone. 

If you are dining in at Hachi, I would highly recommend their yakitori. There are several that I always always order:
-Duck (I like both balsamic vinegar and salt)
-Beef tongue
-Pork belly
-Okra

As for other items on the menu, my favorites are:
-Yamaimo somen
-Beef tataki salad
-Ochazuke (Highly recommend..this is not your typical ochazuke)
-Magic mountain
-Sashimi 

The only thing I don't like about Hachi is their playlist....I believe there is only one song on the playlist, which becomes annoying after hearing it over and over again. Of course that doesn't stop me from coming back here because they have some of the best authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Definitely 5 stars! Excellent dining experience. Overall everything was terrific! Most of all the staff is super friendly and accommodating. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We traveled from Oakland, and everything from the smells from the kitchen, friendly staff, and fantastic food, makes you want to come and have more.  We ordered seconds it was so good.  If you want great sushi, and a great atmosphere, try Hachi."}
{"text":"Two words: Lobster tacos!
                     Service Superb!
                     Food Outstanding!
                     Fabulous Menu!

This will be my go-to place for a date night.  From the friendly smiling hostess to the waiter our service was five stars.

Hubby and I were out on a date night so after hanging at the Onyx bar listening to awesome live music (which is also located inside the Red Rock Casino) we were ready for dinner.  We were seated immediately, no wait!

Menu was incredible with lots of offerings. Since I was down a few cocktails I can tell you that my hubby did all of the ordering.  We started off with some lobster tacos which were incredible.  Tasty little yummy treats that had plenty of chunky lobster bites.  Next we ordered some shrimp and mushrooms...mmmmm, then we had some thin slices of beef that we seared over a hot stone!  Some miso soup and a cold beer was also on our order.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had a review for this on the backburner for a while and I guess I can finally come back to it.  Mind you, we ate at Hachi back a while ago when the Happy Hour was still in effect.  So...I think late last year.  Reason we went was because we were staying at the hotel and had a $50 food credit we could use during that time.  I thought it would be a good idea to go to Happy Hour and try a lot for a little.  It ended up being so-so.

Hachi is the Japanese/Sushi restaurant located in the Red Rock Hotel & Casino (one of my fave stay-cation places).  It really is one of only a small handful of places for sushi in that corner of the Summerlin area.  Naturally, a lot of folks end up here for their sushi fix.  You would think that Hachi would step up their game by bringing some premiere eats.  I can really only give this place an 'average' when taking in food and value.  Food is ok, value, not the greatest.  I guess it's because of the markup when you go to a restaurant in a hotel.  But for the kind of money you spend at Hachi, you could almost do a full meal at another fine dining restaurant in the Red Rock, T-Bones.  Yes it is possible, especially if you get carried away at Hachi ordering multiple signature rolls, nigiri or sashimi, and cocktails.  Watch that cash!

Back when we visited, we did the menu where there were 38 things under $8.  The wifey and I concocted an entire meal on this with our $50 food credit.  We got several tapas-sized dishes and a cocktail or two to dine on.  Bad thing is, I don't recall everything we had right now.  We had five or six different dishes, and when you consider drinks, tax, and tip, we were right above the $50 food credit mark, I paid about $65 total ($50 food credit + $15 out of pocket).  Very good for a cheap date night dinner!

Here's what I remember we did have:

-Crispy Spicy Rock Shrimp - with chipotle aioli
-Hachi BBQ Baby Back Ribs - with crispy noodles and butter lettuce
-Vegetable Tempura - including pumpkin, onion, asparagus, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, and shiitake mushroom
-LSD Roll - spicy shrimp and crab, tempura flakes, avocado, and spicy ginger mayo

The LSD Roll was kinda 'meh'.  It tasted more shrimp than anything else.  The stars of the night for us were the Crispy Spicy Rock Shrimp, and the Hachi BBQ Baby Back Ribs.  Those ribs were tasty!  Sweet, a little bit of heat, but definitely with some Asian flair.  My guess is there might have been some hoisin or ponzu in the BBQ sauce.  Cooked just right, fall off the bone but not soggy.  The shrimp were great as well with that aioli.  The chipotle in it gave it some oomph and accompanied the tender fried rock shrimp.  

Reason I remember having to do this review was because we were there recently and thought about eating at Hachi again when I noticed they got rid of their touted 38 under $8 menu.  The new menu now?  Some changes here and there, some additions, but definitely a bit heavier on the price.  Also, noticed the place just wasn't as busy as it was in the past.  Prices definitely can affect traffic, especially in this dank economy.  We ended up just eating at the food court instead.

But I'll give them this, they got some HOTTIE hostesses!  As I was with the wifey, I merely just glanced.  Glanced.  But they were hot.  Yes, hot.

Hachi as a restaurant?  Lately, not so hot."}
{"text":"Top 3 things at Hachi:
Famous Joey (ask for him to be your waiter!) 
Asian pear (drink) was amazing
LSD sushi roll"}
{"text":"Slow service plus just ok food.  Spent $80+ on baileys, jack and ginger, 2 sushi rolls, and edamame.  The Marijane roll was dry and didn't taste fresh.   The edamame took 20-30 minutes to come out.  Not worth the $$.  The decor of course was beautiful but it's possible to get fabulous decor, food, and service else where."}
{"text":"After a disappointing dinner the night before at a different Red Rock restaurant, I was hoping to just be satisfied.  Hachi delivered, and then some.  We were a large group and had one of the back rooms.  The wait staff was very attentive and their suggestions for sakes and beers were spot on.  We started with the mixed green salad which was crisp and cool and very nice.  We then shared a variety of rolls, including spicy tuna, pink elephant, and, my favorite, the qualude--loaded with salmon, jalapeno, and avocado.

For an entree I chose chicken yakisoba, a noodle dish.  I enjoyed it a lot but was so full from the salad and sushi that I couldn't eat much of it. My colleague next to me had the seared beef tenderloin medallion and said it was amazing. It sure looked good!  For dessert we all shared chocolate fondue.  How can you go wrong with warm, melted chocolate?  Served with strawberries, sesame cookies, and other bite sized treats, it was light and sweet and a perfect ending to the delightful meal."}
{"text":"Hachi is AMAZING!!

Four of us arrived at about 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night. We were promptly greeted and told it would be a short wait. We sat down in the waiting area and the man who greeted us also brought us menus to look at while we waited. They were so nice about keeping us updated and apologizing for the wait, which was not a problem at all. 

Once we were seated, we were promptly served and the waitress took our drink orders. We looked over the menu and basically decided to do everything family style except everyone ordered their own rice dishes. Everything was amazing. First of all, they had natto rolls. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know that I love the traditional Japanese staple and that I judge the authenticity of a Japanese restaurant by the availability of natto. +1 already for having that (it was delicious, by the way).

We ordered the following items:
-Juicy chicken karaage with negi sauce: AMAZING. The sauce really brought out the fried chicken flavor. 
-Chicken thigh with tare: Easily one of the best yakitori sticks I have had, both in Japan and domestically. Great, great flavor.
-Pork belly: probably the winner of the night for me. We got it with tare and I am drooling just thinking about it again.
-Pork with negi shio sauce: OMG an explosion of flavor. This is tied with the pork belly with tare
-Kurobuta sausage: I didn't eat this as I was getting full, but the others in the party seemed to really enjoy it.
-Beef misozuke: so tender and flavorful. We all shared one stick of this. We should have got more!
-Sweet corn: the corn is sweet and there is just something great about grilled corn.
-Shiitake butter: delicious. I liked that they put katsuo flakes on it. It was a nice touch. 
-Ume shiso chicken: Two traditional Japanese flavors that are always a home run. Yummy. 
-Sashimi bowl, unagi bowl, and yakitori bowl: these were the ones we ordered separately and everyone enjoyed it very much. 

The service here is beyond excellent. Our water and soda glasses were always full, and even though we ended up staying at the restaurant for over 3 hours, we never felt rushed or anything. In fact, they kept coming over even after the checks were paid to see if we wanted more water. 

I am definitely coming back and want to try the other menu items. This place really reminds me of the two years I spent living in Japan, and I have only positive things to say about Hachi. From the moment you step into the door to the moment you leave, they treat you like a valued customer and their food is so good. Perfect all around."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour with two girlfriends before we headed to play Bingo at Red Rock Casino.  I have to say, I just really was not impressed with this place, and I definitely wasn't impressed when we got our bill!  Food wasn't very good and it was overpriced.

What I tried:

Miso Soup ($5) - Don't know how you screw up miso soup, but it had a strange aftertaste.

Lobster wontons ($15) - Six wontons, way too little filling.

Sampler Sushi Platter ($15) - One piece of Hachi's six signature rolls.  I tried one piece.  Can't remember the name but thought it was good.

LSD Roll ($8) - This was a good roll

Krystal Roll ($7) - Watermelon and mango with cucumber.  Kind of different but would not want it again.

My friends also had chicken skewers and some sashimi.  Even the LSD roll, which was good, was nothing compared to some of the rolls I've had at I Love Sushi.  Our bill came to $100 and none of us were very impressed with the food.  This is happy hour and we were there for 1 hour!  Maybe the worst part is that about an hour into our bingo play we all admitted that we were still kind of hungry.  Do not recommend this place unless you like paying a lot for a little, in terms of quantity AND quality."}
{"text":"Hands down best robata grill in Las Vegas. Products are fresh and tasty, and they have an extensive skewer menu. Atmosphere is very cozy, reminds me of Japan in many ways. Very recommended!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall with a yakitori grill up front , and dark ambient lighting , they serve up yummy and exotic yakitori ( tongue and the like) to chicken and fish and even wagyu beef and duck.
Sushi was available as well. But we only had yakitori and the small plates.
The fried cartilage was amazing. So was the duck and the wagyu beef yakitori with just plain salt.
Kirin draft as well.
A place to visit in LV Chinatown."}
{"text":"1. Service was attentive, a little too attentive. I was asked if everything was doing okay after every dish i received. I guess its better than no service. 
2. All of the food is really good, but honestly would rather just pay somewhere else for an all you can eat sushi since a lot of the food they have to offer is on any AYCE menu. Ex. Hamachi kama, tempura, yakitori skewers 
3. This is the kind of place that will charge you for anything and everything. I got charged for barley any jalapenos (see photo) it says i was charged for extra jalapeno but that was the first time i asked for it. 

So everything was good, I just dont see myself coming back here. The menu isnt creative but it's so expensive. I left barley full and not satisfied. Ill probably just stick to Inyo or Yonaka for tapas dishes."}
{"text":"Very cool daily menu. Fresh ingredients. Yakitori menu, sushi and more. Service was wonderful and it matched the atmosphere. Definitely goes on the return list!"}
{"text":"We were staying at Red Rock while visiting family in the western Vegas area. We went into Hachi for dinner on a Thursday night. The place looked great- I loved the dark ambiance and decor. We were seated right away, but then again, there were only about 5 other parties in the restaurant. 

We were served a soup, compliments of the chef (although, the server slipped them onto the table and I did not hear what he said it was). It was good in taste... but a cold soup, which I'm not a huge fan of. We then ordered Edamame, which was good... although I have yet to see a restaurant screw up Edamame. I mean, they're steamed and salted and then placed on the table. My boyfriend ordered a sampler plate of sushi and he seemed to really enjoy it. Since I'm not big on sushi, I ordered california rolls and chicken fried rice. They were both good, but I'd put them on the same level as eating at Ra... except double the price."}
{"text":"I love their food, specially the duck skewers. Their sashimi is probably one of the freshest I have tasted in Vegas. Hirame is a must try I would say!

The only down side is that their drinks are pricey, but everything else is good!"}
{"text":"This was a great find during my trip to Vegas. Everything except the beef yakitori was good. The ambiance was excellent as well as the service. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"When your Japanophile foodie friend who's actually traveled to Japan recommends a restaurant such as this one, you pay attention. When he invites you to dinner there, you smile and reply yes.

Hachi is an izakaya which is also owned by the person(s) behind local restaurants Sushi Twister and Ramen Sora, both of which I've enjoyed. It took over the old Kaze Sushi spot (RIP AYCE sashimi lunch) and contributes to the massive parking snafu of the increasingly jampacked Mountain View Plaza on Jones near Spring Mountain. My friend likely suggested this spot because of the late night specials (aka happy hour), which are offered nightly from 10pm-2:30am (last seating at 2:00).

Needless to say, we took advantage of said happy hour menu. However, we also dived into the daily specials and the regular menu, leaning heavily toward the binchotan-grilled and other cooked items more so than the sushi for tonight.

Crispy chips ($2.95 special): chicken skins on steroids. It's just a flavor bomb in a crunchy format, and the simple lemon squeeze does so much for it.

Raw oysters ($1 special): I wouldn't call myself an oyster expert despite having had the food at several places, but I didn't find anything off-putting and appreciated the wasabi and sauce on this. The lemon squeeze was almost not necessary.

(Paitan ramen: I only had a taste of the broth, but I was intrigued by the bonito flavor listed on the menu and easily tasted it in this dish. FWIW, my other friend is a bit of a ramen fiend, and it didn't think that highly of the dish overall. It's a little pricy at $10.50, but I'll consider trying it for myself in the future.)

Chicken Thighs ($1.95/skewer): perhaps a relatively bland meat is actually the best vehicle for the charred flavor bestowed by the highly prized binchotan charcoal. The salted version was actually one of my favorite skewers of the night, while the sweet yet salt-deficient tare version needed help from the tableside condiments. I used the special house soy sauce, which is actually nicely sweet.

Ume Shiso Yaki ($2.60/skewer): a totally different take on the chicken due to the plum and shiso leaf. Not that memorable for me, but worth a try.

Pork Belly ($1.95/skewer): far more meat than fat in the cut used here. The salted versions didn't work as well as the tare for me. I was a bit underwhelmed here.

Pork Cheek ($1.95/skewer): I opted for the tare seasoning here, and I found this juicier and more flavorful than the pork belly. It's one of the better cooked porks in town, but I've tasted truly fantastic pork cheek from another restaurant, and this doesn't really match it.

\"Wagyu\" Tongue ($3.50/skewer): I'd rank this a bit above at least the salted pork belly. It has the distinctive \"crunch\" of tongue and of course that beefy flavor.

Duck w/ Salt ($3.50/skewer): I probably need to try more non-sweet duck preparations to appreciate this fully. I'll say that it was nicely cooked and tender at least.

Bacon-wrapped Enoki ($2.50/skewer): you can never go wrong with bacon, the crunch from the enoki was tremendous, and the ground pepper was a nice touch. I think I could've used a bit of sweetness here though. Maybe I'm sugar-spoiled...

\"Japanese Delicacy Sampler\" ($6.50): one of the real highlights of the meal despite the tiny portion size. Firefly Squid w/ ginger & soy sauce was a tender yet delicious preparation. The other two were both rather chewy but still special. The raw baby eels with daikon and ponzu are a very unusual special, and the fermented squid was surprisingly not that bitter and had obvious citrus notes. I hope it's not just a limited-run daily special.

Ebi Yaki ($3.95 special): think takoyaki, but with tender shrimp in the middle instead of chewy octopus. I wouldn't call this special, but it's very fun and they even force the server to struggle with sprinkling the bonito flakes onto the dish table-side (because you're provided the option of having the server drizzle sauce over it or leave the sauce on the side). It was a good but not exceptional variant of the dish.

Seared Salmon Belly Nigiri ($2.25): I couldn't let the night end without sampling one of my favorite cuts of fish, and it was indeed a delicious, cooked variant of the fatty fish. Some may balk at the touch of sauce on it, but I liked it.

Macha Panna Cotta ($5): yep, had to have dessert too. It's a little thicker than I would've liked, but the matcha flavor shined in every bite, and the azuki (red bean) surprise at the bottom was also fun. I wouldn't say that I was blown away, but I enjoyed this.

And on that note, I wasn't really captivated by a majority of the items that I ate at Hachi tonight. I did enjoy everything though, and I appreciated the care that they showed with quality of ingredients and cooking. I'll definitely come back some time to explore the vast myriad of items on both their regular menus and their daily specials. Oh, and I'm pretty sure I saw otoro listed somewhere..."}
{"text":"Great experience. We sat at the bar and watched everything get prepared. We tried a lot of items from wagyu beef tongue to chicken satay. Everything was fantastic. I would say the wagyu cooked over coals were even better than the blue fin toro, which we had 3 orders of. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"You should definitely try this place! Every single dish we had here (and we were a party of 4) was exceptional. Each item on the 6-type sashimi platter was very good quality and beautifully presented. The grilled scallop yakitori and other appetizers we had were flavorful & perfectly cooked. The seared garlic tuna nigiri was another delicious stand-out. Their \"sashimi roll\" is hands-down my new favorite roll at any restaurant, period. Cannot recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"I love the space here.  I took a bunch of photos in fact, but they disappeared off of my iPhone.  Lame.
It's like being in an underwater jellyfish/cherry blossom garden in the main dining area, and like being in a glass of champagne in the bar.
We sat in a private area in the back with the low tables and cushions on the floor.  Clever designers left plenty of leg room hidden under the table, so instead of sitting on the ground which is what it looks like you'll be doing at first, you actually slip down and sit as you regularly would at a table.  It's a bear to get back out though, especially if you were say, tipsy, wearing a skirt, or elderly.  Or all three.
The food was decent, I think I was actually more impressed with the non sushi offerings than the sushi itself, but it was fresh and tasty.  Service was a bit slow, but we were a large group that came in without a reservation, so maybe our server was slammed with other tables?
I'd recommend it - the space is lovely and the food pretty damn good."}
{"text":"This place is really average. I think there are lots of other places to go for really good Japanese food in Vegas."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for the first time on New Year's Eve with her sister and brother-in-law and we all absolutely loved it. It was super packed with couples, groups, families with kids - just about every demographic.

There was a wide array of food to suit everyone, and it was pointed out to us that the menu often changes which gives everyone a chance to try new things and keep it fresh.

We loved everything we ordered - the crispy spicy shrimp tempura, kobe beef carpaccio, kobe beef gyoza, lemongrass chicken teriyaki - while also enjoying what our tablemates ordered. Definitely recommend the hachi rolls (very much like a california roll) as well as the kobe beef carpaccio and lemongrass chicken teriyaki.

Great atmosphere, quick and attentive staff, fantastic food and an all round great dining experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in town. Their small plates are packed with flavor. My absolute favorites are the Beef Tataki Salad, Cicken Karaage, Crispy Chips, Gyoza, and Yakitori Bowl. Their dessert menu is to die for!"}
{"text":"This would be my favorite place for a late eat out if it was closer to my house. An amazing place with great food and friendly staff. Lou and Sunshine are the best! 

For their food, I love their sashimi, specially the halibut. They have one dollar oysters for late night specials after 10pm every night. I thought they would be bad quality, but they were actually really good and not as salty as other places. Some of them had too much wasabi, but it was still delicious. We also got their 6 kind sashimi combo and otoro sashimi as well. The otoro was just the perfect portion, and their price is definitely unbeatable. They also got 2.50 kirin specials during their late night HH. Service was attentive the whole meal! Will be back as always ;)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Me and my gf have been here several times now and I don't think I've had anything I didn't really enjoy. Well, maybe one dish..Crispy Rice just wasn't my favorite preparation. Otherwise, all grilled and raw items were pretty top notch.
Meat on sticks, usually not my favorite idea in general, but got the duck, chicken thai, wagu tounge, sausage, tomato bacon all very good. Grilled Mackerel tasty. 
All fresh sashimi and rolls very great. Very fresh and great presentation. Very good service too actually. There is just so much competition in Vegas for these type of places, otherwise I would probably give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Creative display of attempt on Japanese authentic dishes.  I have a tastebud for their aged beef but both of my friends thought it stunk; folks, that is an acquired taste just like balut or the 1000 year old duck egg.  I did like tasting the Hikibi Whiskey, whew if you mixed it with Pepsi it will knock you out.  We did not think it was outstanding but we didn't think it was bad as well.  The Sushi was sliced really thick and that is cool but it made no difference if we were going to Makino's to eat their big Tuna slices.  The service was excellent, they like to wear themed holiday uniform and they have great knowledge on their food but you will get to hear, 'Japanese authentically made by Japanese Chef.'  Decor is fabulous...check it out, it's worth the night out."}
{"text":"First of all, this is an upscale restaurant. Their prices are high, the quality of food is high, service and knowledge is paramount. Get over it. 

Station Casinos had some kind of employee appreciation thing going on for the month of June, so you could eat at any restaurant in a Station casino for 50% off. Sweet. This is the only reason my broke ass was able to go. Two people in our party knew the Hachi staff so we got special treatment. We had two servers and two bussers. 

Hachi is the Japanese word for 8, an auspicious number in Japanese and other southeast Asian cultures. The waitstaff wears belts with a sideways eight (otherwise known as an infinity sign) buckle. 

One of the things that bugs me about this place is the decor. It's all good ... just not cohesive. Murakami's signature eyeball wall paper, a huge picture of an ambiguously Asian chick with a giant dragon tattoo (that I've seen all over the interwebs), and cherry blossom ceiling hangings. But I know that's just my nit-picky art faggotry. Onwards. 

The food is really good and they have a mega selection of sake. We had the Demon Slayer, a well-rounded sake, really good to please a party of various sake-drinkers. Their menu is a long list of sushi (temaki, nigiri, and sashimi), as well as entrees, and they do omakase. If you can spring it, there are four different choices ranging $65-120. If you can't, they also have a section of dishes for $8 and under. 

I think one of the gluttonous propensities of America is the delight of variety and at Hachi, we #$%^& capitalized on that ish. We went family style and pretty much ordered everything we wanted (prices are shown before our 50% discount): 

Salmon avocado and mango roll $11. Meh. 

Hamachi sashimi $9, 2 pc. Big pieces, very fresh, clean cut, perfect marbling (but then, I am a fat-chaser). So good with the shiso. Don't throw it away! 

Nasu dengaku $6. Broiled eggplant with miso glaze. Very good. 

Hachi vegetable fried rice $7. Decent. Filler. I think fried rice is a comfort thing. You can have it any where. Move on. 

Spicy kabocha coconut soup $5. Outstanding. Nicely balanced. I'm a sucker for coconut milk and that one bowl of soup probably had a fully day's nutritional requirement of fat. 

Tofu miso $5. Filler. (We get a lot of these flller items because half my family is vegetarian.)

Pan fried Chilean Sea Bass cake $7. This is a pass. If you want sea bass, get the Broiled Sea Bass. 

Hachi BBQ baby back ribs $ 7. 

Braised short ribs $17. 

Broiled Chilean Sea Bass $32. The highlight of the meal. Cooked t perfection, so tender and moist, marinated in miso. 

(We also got lamb chops and some kind of spicy popcorn shrimp, but I don't see it on the online menu. The spicy shrimp things were really good. Reminiscent of the Chinese honey shrimp dish.)

Each of the dishes came with carefully-crafted garnishes, like a marinated daikon cross-section or scallion shafts. The colors and architecture of the pieces were amazing. At Hachi, you get what you pay for and you pay for aesthetics. 

We didn't get these, but they have gimmicky rolls like Pakalolo and Smack. Yum, drugs. 

For dessert we got the Trio brulee $9. Green tea, ginger, and macadamia guanduja [sic?] (tasted primarily like chocolate). Pretty generous portion, comparatively. The ginger was my favorite. 

We sat in one of the two tatami rooms in the back of the deep restaurant. The tatami room has a sunken hearth. You sit on the floor, but you can dangle your legs into a pit. The room we were in had one flat screen tv with the controls mounted on the wall in the room (we watched the Lakers take the Celtics. no comment). You can close the door to keep out most of the outside noise, changing the atmosphere of the room. It was very sexy. But you can't completely seal off from everything. There's a gap between the floor and the bottom of the screen that divided our room from the other tatami room. There was a window view to the outside water and fire feature. 

They also have a sushi bar you can sit at. The restaurant is partitioned into two large sections plus the tatami rooms. 

In the end, I think our total bill was $240 with the 50% discount ($480 before the discount) before tip. It was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. (The listing of foods and our total bill does not reflect the fact that we ordered several of some of the dishes.) 

I think Hachi is one of those Japanese places that's very American or American places that's very Japanese. It does well to educate an American palate of Japanese cuisine with many compromises, how's that?

Everything is so reasonably priced that you're able to enjoy the entire menu. From raw octopus in wasabi to yakitoris to chicken cartilage karaage and price friendly alcohol. 

Just make sure you have a big appetite prior to coming in, or else you'll be saddened by the fact that your stomach won't be able to take another yummy bite of their tasty morsels."}
{"text":"Post-Tokyo Depression can be treated. If you or a loved one is suffering from mediocre American food, poor service, and routine places to eat then Hachi once a week is right for you. No referral or prescription needed, this establishment will be able to relieve all symptoms of disappointing foods and at a generic level price!

Having severe withdrawals from my trip to Tokyo I wanted to experience the quality of Japanese kushiyaki that I had there. Fresh meats, marinated over Binchotan Charcoal and not cooked using a conventional gas grill. I've have had this place bookmarked ever since it first took over the previous sushi restaurant and with some friends in town, we decided to go check it out.

Setting: In the middle of the busy jones/spring mountain plaza, there are tons of places to eat and do. Q karaoke, billiards, cafe moda, hookah etc.... This area to me is the new focal point of go to eats in the chinatown area. 

Interior: Dark and sophisticated, the area has a light smoky smell from the grill but well ventilated. Sushi bar area with seats and booths surrounding it, usually there isn't a challenge to get seated which surprises me because of how good it is.

Food: Sushi, Karage, other japanese apps but the kushiyaki, THIS is why you come here. Ever since my trip to the Philippines, eating with my hands has changed my life and grabbing food with my hands feels so right. So grabbing these meat skewers and sliding it off with my mouth has an usual satisfaction for me. They have chicken, beef, seafood based skewers but my favorite in order are 
1. Wagyu beef tongue
2. Tsukune (you don't need the $1 raw egg, it slides off the meat)
3. Pork cheeks
4. Chicken thigh
5. Intestine
*i prefer the salt over the sauce for the thigh, cheeks, and intestine
**make sure you get a bowl of rice to accompany your skewers

Service: Everyone here is nice and approachable to ask any questions about the food and menu. They welcome you with a big irotshimasen and arigato gojieemasu after you're done, it's like I haven't left Japan.

Overall: I crave this place and if I lived closer i'd be here every other day (we actually came here 2 days in a row)."}
{"text":"The food at Hachi is excellent!  I highly recommend this restaurant.  The Service was as good as the food.l"}
{"text":"This restaurant does not even deserve one star. My family and I went to Hachi to celebrate my little sister's birthday and we had the worst service we have ever had. It took 50 minutes to get our food, and after 50 minutes passed the waitress put a side dish of rice on the table to wait for another 20 minutes. They never refilled our water, the food was way overly priced; $200 could not even give my family of five more than a few bites each. 3 rolls came on one plate without getting a description of what they were. The waitress was completely rude and snappy. When we complained about the service to the manager we received no apology for anything or explanation, just this excuse, \"Well, we have a large party in the back...\". The restaurant was less than half full and it was a Wednesday night. The manager never checked back with us and we never received one of the dishes we ordered. We won't go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Sushi!!! Yum! We come here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"A great selection of brews, whiskey, sake and shoju!!

The miso soup is the best miso soup I have ever had! Has mushroom and bacon in it! Garlic edamame is really good, and huge portion. 

Same owner as Ramen Sora and Sushi Twister!!

Service was great!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chirashi bowl and some of the fish did not taste very fresh. I asked the server to switch it out with a different fish. Waiter talked to the chef, came back and told me that they have been serving this all day and no one complain about it and that that is the taste of the fish (She literally said that). They basically refused responsibility and told me to f*** off. First time here and never again. One star for their grilled squid. That was very good."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised!

Okay, so over the years I've developed almost a snotty attitude towards \"fusion\" or Americanized Japanese food, and it's hard not to when so many restaurants around town do such a poor job at it. So yeah, it took me by surprise that I actually liked this place haha. I ordered their version of fish and chips where they used tempura batter for the fish and used fancy-looking potato chips on the side. The fried food wasn't overly oily which is always a plus. It was seasoned well and the serving size was not bad. I also got this eggplant dish that was disappointing in size but made it up for the taste. My mom got this crab salad that didn't have much crab in it and the dressing was lacking pizzazz but at least it was edible and fresh. Oh! but the best thing that we ordered was this mushroom \"pasta.\" When the dish arrived there was no pasta included, so my mother and I were a bit confused but didn't care enough to ask a server what's up. It was literally the best mushroom dish I've ever tasted in my life and I don't even know how to describe it!! They definitely used shiitake and that's all I can figure out. 

I'm glad we tried this place out. Now I know a place to bring my non-Asian friends to a non-traditional restaurant that actually serves delicious Japanese food."}
{"text":"Great specials - 38 items under $8!!!

Many sushi rolls, hot, and cold dishes were included in the $8 specials. My favorites were the LSD roll with shrimp, avocado, and crab was fresh and flavorful. The baby whitefish were sweet and crispy; the chili sauce was a great contrast for dipping.

Michelle was an extremely friendly/personable bartender who made my friend and I feel very welcome at the bar."}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for a room at Q studios. First impression, the dining room is very nice. The place is very cozy and the staff were superfriendly. We ordered pretty much everything that was on the yakatori menu. Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked to absolute perfection. The standouts to me were the Beef tongue, these were my favorite by far. The pork cheeks in tare, the wagyu beef, duck with salt and pepper. Everything else was wonderful as well but those are the must haves. I also tried the mozzarella cheese in fish cake......i did not like this dish and unfortunately that was my last bite of food. That aside everything else i tried was amazing......simple yet executed perfectly. This is definitely on my list of favorite restaurants in Vegas. Did i mention they have ice cold draft beer? I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Let me start off this review by saying, by the second visit, I almost wanted to move in here.

First time we had dinner here, everything was good, the chef's appetizer sampler with the crab butter, beef tataki with cucumber, and the eggplant--it all took my taste buds for a sweet ride. The least remarkable was the eggplant. The beef and the crab were good. Must try. I also had yakitori: chicken thigh with tare, pork belly with salt, shiitake butter, shishito pepper and tsukune. Everything is delicious. The first bite I took of the tsukune, my first reaction was mmm.... wtf is that?! (With a look of disbelief--in a good way). I then ordered more of the tsukune. The wagyu tongue is sooo good too. Must be the charcoal they used. All their yakitori is soooo tasty. You have to have some yakitori when you eat here.

Second time I went, I had all of the above again AND the kanpachi collar which landed on our table by accident (fortunately). Another must have. I also had mackerel and halibut sashimi which were both good thought not as out of this world as their yakitori.

On both visits, my kids loved their katsu and karaage as well. They have really good karaage.

Service is good. Ambience is authentic japanese.

Overall I would definitely come here again. Highly recommended. This place provided me with a positively unforgettable Japanese food in Vegas experience."}
{"text":"Was attracted to this sushi restaurant by a coupon on weluvlocals.com.  This place isn't really bad, but I didn't find it especially out of the ordinary, and thought it was very expensive even with a coupon.    

The upside for this place is the atmosphere, which is nice.  If you are willing to pay up for atmosphere and like to be forced to eat very little food by way of high prices, this place may be for you.  It is not for me.

Waiter was courteous, but pushy and big on the upsell.  Under pressure and not having seen the price on the menu, we succumbed to ordering a $5 plate of edamame which was small, maybe about 20 to 30 pods.  We resisted his suggestion of mineral water.

California roll was edible but nothing special, with the usual \"krab\".

The other roll we got we didn't care for at all.  Forgot what it was called but it was one of their rolls with a wacky name.  While we generally try to be adventurous with foods, we often find that ordering sushi rolls that we are not familiar with usually turn out to be a disappointment.  Some of the rolls we often order as a safe bet, such as the caterpillar and the rainbow, were not on the menu.  

Miso soup is a la carte for $5/bowl.  We did not order any.

Chicken Yakisoba ($16) was below average, even when compared to other much less expensive restaurants.  Noodles were sticky and slightly greasy.  I wouldn't normally order this but I was very hungry and in need of some filler, and was concerned that I wouldn't otherwise get out of this place with a full stomach for under $100.

Also, my beer was brought to me and it was warm.  I sent it back and it was replaced with another brand, but I was charged full price even though it was not my desired beer, without any other compensation offered.  I didn't bother trying to argue for a free beer because I just wasn't in the mood and didn't care that much.

Order included the plate of edamame, small sashimi, 1 california roll, one other roll, and chicken yakisob.  Plus one 22-oz beer and one glass of wine.


Total for 2 people with tax and tip, less $25 off coupon, was $72.  I could eat the same thing in Sacramento in an equivalent restaurant for about $45 inclusive, without a coupon.  Shall not return."}
{"text":"I took a party of approximately 10 people to the Hashi on Mondy October 1, 2013 for dinner.  They convinced us to do the chef special which as I understood it is they bring you a variety of sushi and a lot of it.  The price range they quoted us was $60 to $150 per person, and we chose the $60 per person.  After waiting for food for an hour and a half, we left the restaurant.  We complained several times and no sushi ever came.  What they did bring out was non-sushi appetizers trying to hold us at bay, and in the end, I think they were trying to fill us up on non-sushi.  

The service was absolutely horrible.  Waiter would leave and not return for 30 minutes at a time, and was nowhere to be found.  They give the pretense of being a nice place with great service when you walk in - 2 attractive hostesses and a man in a suit who escorts you to your table.  We never saw from the man in the suit again and as we walked out nobody even tried to apologize."}
{"text":"Friend recommended new izakaya place called Hachi to me, and I just had to go. 

1) Crispy Chips (4.5/5) - fried crispy chicken skin....so bad for you but so good. 

2) Sashimi Roll (5/5) - assorted seafood wrapped by rice paper topped with an amazing yuzu miso sauce. one of the mandatory dishes you must order...it was delicate and delicious

3) Kurobota Sausage (3.5/5) - all the times I've gotten kurobota sausage...I've been underwhelmed so I may be a bit biased. but it was cooked just fine. however, compared to all the other dishes, I probably wouldn't get this again next time.

4) Chicken Thigh (5/5) - $1.60 per skewer. you can get it with salt or their tare sauce. they grill all their yakitori with this high quality Binchotan charcoal, and it just tastes better. the meat is succulent and flavorful.

5) Chicken Teba Wing (4/5) - $1.50 per wing. cooked perfectly with the skin just delicately crispy while the meat itself is very juicy. 

6) Yamakake Hachi Style (5/5) - mountain yam sliced into thin noodles with tuna sashimi and greens. I love unique, authentic dishes like this and I would get this over and over again. 

7) Pork Belly (4/5) - $1.75 per skewer, same with chicken thigh, you can get it with salt or tare. tasted good but I think the chicken thigh is superior.

8) Assorted Sashimi (4.5/5) - got the three kinds of fish for $17. comes with standard tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. fish was fresh, thick slices, what more can you ask for.

The head chef was awesome.  The variety and quality of food was awesome. If you come, I think you have to get the Sashimi Roll and Chicken Thigh (and also the yamakake hachi style if you're feeling adventurous)."}
{"text":"All the grilled skewers were very delicious but the sushi my table ordered was just okay. I was actually a little bummed out until the yakitori showed up and saved the dinner. My suggestion would be to skip the sushi entirely and order only from the menu with all the skewers. Also they have Orion beer which is a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday.  Great place to enjoy sake with friends and pig out on everything from chicken wings to sashimi.  Every dish we ordered was delicious. The salmon sashimi melts in your mouth.  Everyone loved the bacon covered mushroom.  The waitresses were also very attentive.  The ice cream with honey toasted bread was amazing.  Can't wait to come back on my next trip."}
{"text":"We were looking for authentic Japanese places to eat for awhile. Hachi is a nice surprise. 

Yakitori is really good. We had chicken thigh in several sauces and tsukune. Sushi was good too especially scallop carpaccio. My favorite were fresh oysters with wasabi sauce: creamy and delicious. 

This is going to be our to-go yakitori place from now on. Service was excellent and atmosphere was good for having a conversation."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you like izakaya and yakitori types of Japanese food. The atmosphere is perfectly Japanese and is matched nicely with the quality and fine taste of the food. The service is decent and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. I especially liked their yakitori with ume and basil. We will  definitely return."}
{"text":"I dined there for the second time a couple of nights ago. I really love their LSD Rolls that's one of the main reasons why I came back.! This roll is made of spicy shrimp and crab, avacado,spicy ginger mayonnaise, and tempura flakes that give it a little bit of crunch.This is part of their $8.00 menu. I also had this salad on my first visit that had mango, and crab meat in it. I thought it would be a yummy combo but I wasn't crazy about the type of greens they put in the salad. I think it's called frisee' it was a little too prickly for my taste. I think it may taste better with raw spinach. It also has a weird smell to it.That would be something I would never order again. I also had the Chicken Fried Rice which was really good and it was only $9.00 for a good sized portion. On my second visit I had a steak that was topped with crab meat and tempura asparagus surrounded by a cream sauce. That was tasty because the steak was nice and juicy. I'm used to eating rice with my steak so I ordered a side of white rice with my meal. I had the Molten Chocolate Cake that came with vanilla ice cream and Shiso sauce. It was delicious !
On my second visit our waiter introduced me and my hubby to sake. We had the Wakatake which has a much milder taste then wine does. I also has a sample of their plum sake which was sweeter. I wanted to try their blueberry sake called Star Rabbit but they were out of it. It's supposed to be one of the sweetest! 
Overall I love the cherry blossom decor and the eyeball wall and the service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place.  I only ate here once so I am hesitant to give it 5 stars yet.  However, the whole experience was wonderful.  And even found ourselves talking to the chef who was helping out in the dining room with service.  

Hachi - 8.  The restaurant  serves several selection of dishes for under 8 dollars.  The menu also had more pricier dishes but we stuck to the under 8 dollars.  Ordered japanese beer and hot sake and waited. 

In the interim, we received an amuse bouche - it's a mini starter to whet one's appetite.  broccoli soup with rice cracker bits. And it did ours.  We look forward to the dishes we ordered.

Our order
Standard edamame
lobster akadashi - red miso, fried lobster mini rolls
asahi crab salad, greens, bits of crab (generous portion) with cilantro vinagrette
kholester roll, kimchee/cream chesse stuffed jalapeno tempura
LSD roll - spicy shrimp and crab roll with spicy ginger mayonaise

ALL GOOD!!!!  

Then of course, we needed to try dessert and we picked the tres creme brulee with the following flavors, green tea, macadamia nut and mango?

The chef was nice to talk to and she had come from NY and was offered to open the place and is now a pearl in the restaurant world of empty oysters.

When you visit the Red Rock Resort and Casino, run to Hachi for a delightful meal."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and entrees! Nice atmosphere (a bit loud to have a conversation, though) and good service! The desserts were extravagant as well. This place would have gotten 5 stars if it were not for the slightly high prices. If you're in the neighborhood, have a sushi craving and a few extra bucks, this place will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I went on a friday night (had a 7pm res), met 2 friends and was seated very quickly.  Very good wait staff....water glass always refilled.  Don't miss the Sake-Tini...I had to order a 2nd even though it's a bit pricey.  The waiter was sort of pushing more drinks but I was thinking about the blood alcohol level on the drive home!  We had a bunch of items from the $8 menu....the ribs were amazing!  I could have easily made a meal out of them.  The beef croquettes were really good as was the chicken kushiyaki, veggie tempura plate, crispy wontons and curry beef.  The salmon tiradito was amazing but I wouldn't order again...very little on the plate.  LSD and Formula 51 rolls were good but not great.  From the regular menu we ordered the  Maryjane roll which was very good not great (I wasnt blown away by the sushi here).  We also ordered the Hamachi something which is the yellowtail collar.  It's not on the regular menu so you may need to ask for it.   It was just a bit fishy but once it hit the dipping sauce, it was DELICIOUS....really tender and juicy.  We ordered a 2nd round of babyback ribs....best thing we had that night!  Then we had the creme brulee dessert sampler:  the flavors were ginger, green tea and chocolate hazelnut.  Don't miss this one.....very exotic and really good.   The atmosphere was pretty trendy and lots of party people were dropping in and out on a regular basis.  If you don't mind the hipster trendoids (I have been ignoring them and their irrelevance since the dawn of time), definitely pay this place a visit.  This place needs to be supported by regular locals after the hipsters move on to the next IN place!"}
{"text":"Was recommended this new place by a colleague - stellar! The miso and the teppan beef were excellent. I finished up with hot saki and salmon sushi ( also great ) . Great service and cool vibe . 

Highly recommend without hesitation !!!"}
{"text":"When I was in Vegas over the summer, I was craving sushi. My family loves the Red Rock Casino and Hachi looked amazing. My boyfriend and I went in twice. The first time, the server(who was really sweet) gave us a card for our next visit that would discount our meal. So, we did. Both visits were great. It is pricier than the other sushi restaurants I go to back home. I think a California roll was 10 dollars. 

The sushi was great though. Fresh, delicious, and good quality. I did end up ordering a salad I did not like but the server was kind enough to take it off our check and I was able to try some of the edamame. Next time I come to Vegas, I have to come back."}
{"text":"It's my first time visit here, and the food is absolutely great! After 10pm, they offer drink special and some discount to certain  food item. I just love it! Will come back again^_^"}
{"text":"This is one of the few restaurants that offers Yakitori in town. The quality of the food was very good. Most of the items are single orders so keep that in mind when ordering. I especially enjoyed the seared garlic tuna sashimi, the oysters, the seared homemade pork chashu and the wagyu beef stick. We had two different types of chicken on a stick, however, they were both very average. The menu is pretty extensive and there are plenty of options available. The decor of the restaurant is really nice and pleasant. This is definitely a good place to come with friends. The service was also very good. All of their staff were nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here to try something new and it looked nice and had good reviews but I quickly felt this place was over hyped. From dish to dish I just kept waiting to be impressed and every-time I ended up disappointed. The edamame had way too much salt on it. And all of the skewers were just whatever. The cutlet bite steak was literally a deep fried steak with bbq sauce made to sound like way more then it was. And the Teppan beef was unimpressive. So now waiting for the honey toast I have come to the peak of my disappointment with the match panna cotta. Don't think of it as the \"sweet\" fun \"white girl\" desserts because it's more of the hardcore Asian type. Try it and you'll know what I mean. All I have to say is the honey toast was good."}
{"text":"Excellent service and tapas style Japanese dishes.

They pretty much have everything for everyone at Hachi. Of course the highlight was the wagyu beef plate that is cooked to perfection. But you can also get udon dishes, croquettes, fried skewers, and much, much more. There's yakitori and there's sushi/sashimi for the raw fish eater. 

Very pleased with everything here and would certainly come back."}
{"text":"We timed our arrival to take advantage of the drink specials offered during happy hour at the bar.  Ann ordered a glass of Chardonnay (3 Sips out of a possible) while I chose a Zen-Tini (Chai liquor, green tea liquor and Stoli vanilla vodka) (3.5 Sips).  We started off sharing a bowl of the spicy Kabocha coconut soup (4.5 Spoons) and nasu dengaku (broiled eggplant with sweet miso (4.5 Forks). Our next order included a large portion of veggie fried rice (3 Forks), a mixed greens salad with ginger dressing (2.5 Forks) and chicken kushiyaki with a Peruvian sauce (2 Forks).  Overall the meal was very satisfying though the portion size of the chicken skewers was ridiculously small and the meat overdone."}
{"text":"My wife and I settled on a wide variety of small plates that included:  cucumber salad w/seaweed & yam (3.5), bok choy ohitashi (2.5), garlic edamame (4.5), chicken thigh steak (4.5), enoki mushroom wrapped w/bacon (3), shishito pepper (2), tsukune (4.5), age nasu & mochi oroshini (2.5) and a small rice (2.5).  As noted by my assigned rating for each dish, quality ranged from fair to very good with price points well below the more famous Raku."}
{"text":"This restaurant rocks. The food is so good and so tasty and so yummy and the Hachi roll is the best roll and we ate two and we should have ordered eight and I tried their Dragonberry Sangria and it was so good that I had two but I never would have had eight and I just love their food. Arigato Gozaimasu!"}
{"text":"Yum, YUM, Yum. Good but pretty pricey... Ok... Very pricey. The green tea was the best I've ever tasted, the white sangria was killer, and the sushi was fab. Losing one star for the cost to quality and portion ratio. Don't get me wrong, the quality was high, and maybe I'm just expecting too much seeing how far they are from the ocean... But, what can I say? I've been eating sushi since I could walk, so I'm picky."}
{"text":"Very much real Japanese dishes. Food is good here. They even open till 2:30 am so I often go there. One of my favorite restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Greeted right when you walk in. Service was very attentive, food was so good, and honey toast was sweet and HUGE!!"}
{"text":"How are you not packed with lines out the door? It leaves me confounded!

This is absolutely the best and my favorite Izakaya in Las Vegas.  The service is great and the chefs are professional and friendly.

Our server Lou was attentive despite a Friday evening service.  

Definitely get sashimi, skewers, and any specials on the board. Cheese chikuwa, not even sure who thought of this genius/insanity, but it's a must have! 

Been here many times and never had a single bad bite.  That's a hard thing to say, but it's true."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Las Vegas.. lots if deliciulous options on the menu.
For sure try the duck, salmon collar (I had 2), and the Mackerel fish."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Hachi and again, I was completely impressed. The service was great as always and the atmosphere light and very comfortable. I have not had a meal I didn't care for or regretted. However, I you want to really give yourself a treat, get the vegetable tempura. I am not a typical vegetable person but man there tempura is the best. When I first visited, you could select the tempura by vegetable but now you must by the plate of mixed veggies. 

The meat skewers, the fried rice, the Teriyaki, the rolls... need I go on? The majority of the items on the menu are quite reasonable and they offer a boat load of selections for eight bucks and under. 

Do yourself a favor and get away from the strip when in Vegas and try out Hachi -- I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here about 3 weeks ago and wow, I'm definitely making it one of my regular yakitori go to spots. I love that this place is open late and the servers and chefs are very friendly. Fun casual ambiance, great for groups of friends or date night. Now on to the food! These are the memorable dishes:
Beef tongue : mustttt get. Mine was cooked was perfectly, so tender. I ordered 3 of these :D
Pork cheek: reminded me of the Korean pork neck/pork jowl. Order it!
Pork belly: definitely get an order of this if you like pork belly. Its not too fatty and very flavorful.
Kire katsu: BESTT katsu in vegas yet.. you're missing out if you don't try katsu from here.
Tako wasa: i looooove tako wasa. it's not the best I've ever had but still worth getting. Best I've ever had was in San Diego and let's be honest... No way Vegas seafood is going to beat SD's seafood.
Duck: can't remember if I had this but if we did, it was good. There was nothing I didn't like!
Spicy tuna roll: it was alright. The tuna looked like there was additional food coloring added in.
Wagyu yakitori: omgg, melt in your mouth goodness!! This came very close to the kobe beef I had in Japan, which nothing can beat. 
Honey brick toast: WAYY too big for 2 people but nonetheless we had to order it. It comes with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. I probably wouldn't get it again because I felt like a fatass afterwards. This brick toast is a lot more simple than ones I'm used to but it was still yummy. Worth trying if you've never had brick toast before.
Overall, I'd recommend this place to EVERYone. The prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Damn.

I have never had fresh raw fish like this in my life. If something like this exists in Chicago then I don't know what or where it is but I need to find it NOW.

We were only sort of hungry when we decided to dine here late Friday night so we didn't order much but what we sampled was just fabulous. The best bites of food we had the entire time we were in Vegas.

I was leery of Hachi because it's located inside Red Rock Hotel and thought it would just be bad hotel food but I was totally wrong. 

We ordered the vegetable tempura and a sampler (not sure if it was a special?) of 4 types of fish, sashimi style. 

The vegetable tempura was awesome. All tempura for the most part is awesome. Their's was light and crispy with warm ponzu sauce. What I liked most about this tempura was the fact that it came with veggies that I never see in tempura on menus in Chicago. Large slice of pumpkin, avocado and shiitake mushroom. All three to die for. Avocado in tempura batter????? What??? YES PLEASE. Long green bean, onion and broccoli too, so delicious. So light and just plain yummy.

The sashimi sampler was really the show stopper though. Each type of fish came with 2 pieces. If this was in fact a special, each type of fish can be ordered individually under \"New Style Cold Plates\" on the menu. All 4 types of fish were outstanding but the two that made me almost cry out of sheer bliss were the Albacore with crispy onions and citrus and the Tuna Tataki with bacon crumble, cilantro and sweet sauce. Perfect f*cking bites of food. The fish was sliced pretty thin but each bite was so meaty and delicious, so rich and chewy (chewy in a good hearty-oh-my-god-way). I have just never ever ever had raw fish that tasted this incredibly amazing.  The Yellow Tail with Jalapeno and the 4th option (I cannot remember what it was now!!) also tasted great, no complaints what so ever, but the Tuna Tataki and the Albacore were life changing. 

If you are staying on the strip Hachi is about 20 to 30 minutes drive out of the way, but there is still a casino and bar about 20 seconds away in the hotel so you can still get trashed, gamble and eat amazing sushi all at the same time. If you love sushi as much as I do and don't live in a part of the world where you can get fresh fish flown in from Hawaii shoveled into your mouth on a daily basis then you need to make Hachi a priority so you can live a complete life and die fulfilled."}
{"text":"We love this place, come here every few
Months and are never disappointed. Brought my mom in and she loved it too. Great thing about this place is you can order as you go you so can try lots without being stuffed. Every day they offer a special item at a steep discount and this day it was grilled oysters and scallop skewers. We ordered both and they were both good. The scallops were really good. We then ordered the crispy chicken skin and marinated salty squid. Crispy chicken skin is like pork rinds, salty and crisp. The squid was not what I was expecting but cold and in a heavy sauce. It was really good. We then had orders of duck with salt, chicken thigh with salt, wagyu beef, smelts, mackerel and shrimp tempura and all were excellent. We ended the meal by having a passion roll and the special ramen. Everything was so good we left full and happy"}
{"text":"I don't have a long drawn out review to place here today. I was thrilled with their happy hour sake bottle specials and the LSD roll is to die for. So far everyone I know that comes here, makes that at least one of the selections for the evening devouring. This place is hip, and I love the decor as well. Definitely worth a try if you haven't been there, and a repeat visit if you have."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Hachi for a belated birthday party. The ambiance and atmosphere were wonderful. Classy yet modern. The 38 items under $8 were quite fun, but that's the extent to what Hachi has to offer. The food there isn't great. There are plenty of much better sushi restaurants in town to choose from, but if you're looking for a fun place to hang out, then Hachi is your choice."}
{"text":"We came in here because my friend wanted sushi and my husband doesn't want to eat sushi because of Fukushima. This place satisfy both.  We ordered:

Jalapeno Yellowtail (Delicious)
Spicy Tuna Roll (Not bad)
Seared Garlic Tuna Nirgir (Delicious)
Grilled Oyster (First time having grilled oyster, really enjoyed this)
Chicken Karaage (Too oily for my liking)
Kurobuta Sausage (Good)
Seared Pork Chashu (Too dry)
Pan Fried Gyoza
Wagyu Beef (Delicious, but $6.95 for a piece I would call it...to me they cut a regular piece into 3 pieces on a skewer)
Premium Tongue (It's the same situation like the Wagyu Beef)
Shishito Peppers
Baked Green Mussels

Soy allergy people shouldn't eat here.  It's filled with soy ingredients here.  I know I won't be back.  But it was nice trying to please everyone by come here.  Friend and husband were happy.  

Parking is a little bit of a nightmare.  Come 5-10 minutes before your meet time, just in case you can't find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Bottom line..Bad service, customer is always wrong at this place..The food was pretty good and the place is hidden enough so there's not much if a wait, for Monday night atleast.  We had a male server in which we ordered a pretty decent amount appetizers..we asked a few questions about the truffle oil app and we went back and forth and told him well wait til rest of food c9mes out before we order..after about $71 worth of apps the truffle oil abalone came out. We told lady we didn't order it and she respectfully took it back..the original male server came back and insisted we ordered it..basically customer is wrong at this place. I didn't argue any further and dude seemed upset so I took it back and ate it. Sucks cause this place is good and waiter ruined the experience, atleast the male one did."}
{"text":"What can I say?

After the first time we went, we went 5 more times in the next 10 days. #truth 

Here's the rundown:

Sashimi specials - if it's on the board, try it. Never let an opportunity pass you by. 

Jalapeño yellowtail - fresh, delicious, not spicy, love the onion slivers

Pork belly skewers - delicious both ways, salt or sauce. The flavor is amazing, the charcoal they use really enhances it and makes it just that much better than any other pork belly you may have had. Promise!

Chashu and or the chashu bowl - oh mah gah!  The chashu is just DEEELISH!  Can't even describe it. I want it every day! 

Chicken Karage - go for it...get it with the sauce.  You won't be disappointed. 

Other highlights: enoki bacon skewer, chicken thigh skewer, okra, tsekune...yum!! Get it with the poached egg..so rich, 1 egg is enough for a table to share, sashimi plate, squid, and of course...the brick toast! 

See you there!! Lol. 

 Also, staff is attentive, place is clean. Parking is hit or miss. It's in a busy plaza. And they have a private room for parties. It's great!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance in the Red Rock Hotel/Casino. The entrance to the casino is pretty at night with the water and the flame spouts. The restaurant itself has a gorgeous ceiling. I found the setting of this to be the best part of the experience.  I had a cucumber salad which was fresh, as well as the small and not necessarily worth it, steak skewers. The sushi seemed a bit expensive with even simple spicy tuna rolls costing 11/12 bucks. I tried an 8 ball roll which I liked. I usually dont try exotic rolls and prefer to fill up on basic ones. But I tried White Lightning and the Jake ? Roll. The Lightning is one of the best rolls I have had in some time. The rice pudding with peaches and coconut milk was delicious for dessert. I will come back but many of the rolls are automatically 16 dollars or more. This is not a good late choice since i think they dont take people for sushi after 10."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I loved this sushi restaurant. It is located inside the Red Rock Casino. We went because we had a $15 off coupon. The only thing is it is a bit pricy but I was expecting that since it was a higher scale sushi restaurant inside a casino. We started with their edameme which was good (can't go wrong with that!). They then brought out the salmon that was done in a citrus sauce. This was the best sushi salmon I've ever had! The sauce was amazing and made the dish. We also ordered the two mini lobster tacos which were to die for! I wish they were bigger or came with more because two was just not enough. We ordered the spicy tuna and hachi roll which were both good. My favorite part of the meal was the lobster tacos and salmon. I would go back just to enjoy those two dishes again."}
{"text":"For a contemporary Japanese cuisine joint, not too shabby.  Decor was neato bandito with lots of pink coloring and giant Sakura (Japanese Cherry Blossom) pics on one side, and a giant Eyeball mural on the other (which I swear was watching me...).  The ceiling was lined with a huge chandelier made with a rainstorm of pink glass in cherry blossom shape.  Nice!  We showed up on a Friday night with no reservations and were seated within 5 minutes.  On to the grub...

After perusing the menu a bit we ordered tons of little things and shared everything famiri sutairu (Family Style).  Here's the rundown:

Risotto w/ Shitake Mushroom Appetizer - a little bland, but ok for a comp starter

Mixed Greens Salad w/ Ginger Dressing - Freakishly delicious!

Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Serrano Chili Ponzu - Nicely done!

Lobster Akadashi Soup - Red Miso Soup with a hint of Lobster essence and leek.  Nice!

Various Tempura items - Shrimp was average, Japanese Eggplant had a neat flared presentation, Asparagus was tasty, French Beans were good as well, Fresh Hearts of Palm was interesting, and Avocado... Avocado Tempura?  Holy weird beards Batman... not too shabby either.

Chicken Kushiyaki Skewers with Spicy Peruvian Sauce - I was hoping for the spicy green aji sauce but it was something else... although fairly tasty nonetheless.

Wagyu Gyoza - Probably the most lux type of meat I've had in an everyday dish like Gyoza.  They were deep fried wonton style rather than the traditional pan seared and steamed, but quite scrumptious!

Chicken Yakisoba - Lots of shitake mushrooms abounded and the sauce they used was excellent.  Once of the tastier items!

Various Sushi Items:  Shima Aji Nigiri (Striped Jack) was good, Uni Nigiri was excellent.  You can always tell the quality of a place if they have good Uni.  Stinky Uni will have me running for the hills in a hurry.  Salmon Skin Handroll was good as well, but bad for my breath.  Doh!  Spicy Tuna Roll with Chili Mayo dip... nice kick to it.

Pics are up, and overall a meal nicely done.  Kudos to Executive Chef Linda Rodriguez and her crew."}
{"text":"It's Sunday night. We're at Red Rock Casino and have time to kill before watching The Croods at 9..My boyfriend is starving and I am on day 6 of a detox so can't eat with him but will settle for some tea with lemon. We were just going to get him some prime rib at the cafe but the line was long so we decided to venture out and give Hachi a go since they looked pretty empty. 

I really loved the ultra chic look of Hachi.. You definitely don't feel like you're at Red Rock Casino anymore. I would say the prices are pretty high for a local casino joint almost strip prices. My bf decided on a chicken teriyaki plate (chicken + steamed rice) which was $22!!!.. must be some bomb chicken teriyaki right??? Ehhh he said it wasn't bad but it's definitely not the best he's ever had. It was a grilled chicken breast with teriyaki glaze on it. As I watched him eat I was thinking hmm we should come back and actually eat a meal here since the atmosphere is so nice. 

So the 2 stars is for the service. I know from working in the restaurant industry no one wants a couple where the guy just orders an entree and the girl just gets tea. But I am on a DETOX ...which I told our server from the get go and my man didn't want to be feasting without me. We just felt as though the server thought of us as a burden for being there & looked down on us. Had he done a better job and been more friendlier perhaps we would have left happier and would want to go back like we were originally planning on doing. pftttt. 

HOT TIP: check out their daily Happy Hour at the bar 5-7 and hopefully their bartender will not treat you like you're a burden."}
{"text":"Their sashimi was really good. This place would be good place to go if their place is in Japan. (I recently moved the States from Japan). I definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the service etiquette in a restaurant. The food was delicious or at least the ones we ordered. The waiter that we got was snobbish and didn't really pay attention with our questions and concerns with certain dishes. He took it upon himself to think that we wanted the dishes since we asked what it was. Long story short , His mistake was the customers fault..(customers should not be blamed cause u want there business )and the chef and other staff were arguing in front of the customers in their language. I felt that was extremely unprofessional and just embarrassed for them cause the place looks classy but service doesn't match.Japanese tapas/yakitori  in Vegas is a dime a dozen.. I can take my business somewhere else and get same food quality and better service."}
{"text":"This place was great. I attended the Yelp Elite event and won a $100 gift certificate to Hachi. In my head I envisioned all the hours of working out this $100 dinner was going to entail. Yes that was my very 1st thought. well that's not exactly how it happened...

APPETIZERS: my bf got the Kabocha Coconut soup $6 - and worth every bite. oh so good. my weight suggested the Crab salad. $8. eh. It was the least liked thing I ate that day. 

SUSHI: Ah.. the good stuff. I ordered the top 6 sampler. To this moment I dont know all of them except the LSD roll but the middle 3 were beyond delicious. I'd order that roll again. bf had the smack and qualude rolls. damn. good. I had the G-rock and it too was to die for.  I ordere dht chicken Kushi great. 

SASHIMI: Let me begin by saying I've never ordered sashimi but I pictured sushi w/out rice. I was wrong. It was slivers and I do mean very finessely cut slivers of fish. On our waiters suggestion we got a sampler. 4 bites each for $16. overrated (not b/c it was hachi but just sashimi in general. I can say with 100% honesty it tasted really good but I'd never order that again. 

DESSERT: We never saw a dessert menu but our waiter suggested a cheesecake slice or creme brulee trio which sounded heavenly. and IT WAS. one was green tea, one was chocolate and one was original i think. it was to freakin die for. we almost finished it but I decided the green tea was my fav. and left most of the chocolate one. after the calorie fest we just had... 

Hachi is a very chic restaurant. feels like they plucked it straight out of a Sex & the City HBO TV shoot and yes right out of NY city. Would I be back. yes, probably for the HH since apprently that is one hoppping place to be during HH. 
We left Hachi and gambled a little and I walked in w/ $20 and walked out w/ $60. love it when that happens. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I love the decor and ambiance!!  They have private rooms in the very front of the restaurant (unfortunately facing the parking lot!!) but they are beautiful!! The happy hour (at the bar only) from 5 - 7 pm is awesome.. they have bottomless mimosas for $8! 

The rolls are great, averagely priced sushi for the location... You'd think Red Rock would be charging $15 minimum per roll, but no.. You can get a roll for $8 - $11 just like everywhere else.  Great place for a first date!"}
{"text":"Izakaya 

My favorite unfiltered dame and I arrived a little early to Hachi last night; none-the-less there were quite a few others waiting to get in as well. Usually a line is a great sign something amazing is about to go down!!

The stars speak for themselves the fish is very fresh and totally the opposite of your typical low grade AYCE joints! The seared tuna was by far one of my favorites. 

I'm not a fan of oysters or so I thought until I took mine down like a pro! I was expecting a gritty taste but the oysters were rinsed well before put back in the shell to serve! I skipped on the wasabi that junks totally an acquired taste. 

The soy sauce wasn't your typical salty condiment; it's actually refreshing and not overbearing. 

Highly recommend this place if your about that quality vs quantity lifestyle. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! The good is so good, priced fairly and it all tastes so fresh!"}
{"text":"Hachi is one of the latest izakayas to open up shop, taking up residence along the popular corners of Jones and Spring Mountain.  With ramen (Ramen Sora) and AYCE sushi (Sushi Twister) under their belts, the owners went a different route with their newest venture in yakitori. 

Greeted promptly and eagerly on a recent Sunday evening, the restaurant was a third full with Japanese-speaking clientele. 

Our waiter was thorough and energetic with explaining the menu and there was a bit to review.  We ordered a little of everything, but let's get to my favorites first. 

* Crispy Chips \"Deep fried chicken skin chips with house seasoning\" ($3) - Oh. My. Gawd. This had me dancing in my seat! Fresh off the fryer with a squeeze of lemon and I am having a party in my mouth. I love deep fried chicken skin and their version just makes me so happy. As a result, we added 2 more orders. Love love love! 

* Yamaimo Chips \"Japanese mountain yam skin fried isobe style\" ($3) - Having only experienced this dish at one other place, we were psyched to see it here. Yum. Yum. Yum. Can I get an Amen? Oh yeah! There's a limit of 3 orders a day since they don't carry a huge quantity of mountain yams. We were more than happy to claim all 3 for ourselves.

* Ika Karaage \"Deep fried squid\" ($3.50) - A tasty aioli accompanied this dish.

* Skipjack Tataki Hachi Style ($6.50) - This dish came from their specials board. It's loaded with raw red onions, which may not be something for everyone. I especially liked the shiso leaf, onions, and mayo(?) combination, but it was a little too heavy-handed with the Hachi sauce.

* Assorted Sashimi Bowl ($9.98) - This came with about 10 pieces of fresh fish on top of rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice and I didn't expect it to be since they don't serve any nigiri here from what I gathered. This is a great opportunity to use their special soy sauce blend made with bonito flakes, so it's a bit sweeter.

* Scallop Carpaccio \"Scallop sashimi topped with masago, cherry tomatoes, micro cilantro and micro greens. Splashed with olive oil, white soy sauce, lemon yuzu, and yuzu miso sauce.\" ($9.95) - The scallop was fresh and bright, and the fish eggs were flavorful (although they seemed more like tobiko than masago). I wasn't the hugest fan of the micro cilantro and micro greens and felt the yuzu miso sauce took away from the clean flavors of the seafood.

* Halibut and Sea Urchin Carpaccio \"Thinly sliced halibut topped with seared sea urchin, green onion, momiji oroshi and yuzu ponzu.\" ($12.50) - Although delicately presently, it lacked something. The flavors weren't coming out as much as we would have hoped for this dish.

* Tsukune with Oroshi Ponzu ($3.50) - It's made with ground pork and was surprisingly quite juicy. Their yakitori does take awhile, so I suggest putting those orders in early. They use Binchotan charcoal (versus a gas grill or regular charcoal), which means the food grills at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Be sure to utilize their condiments, specifically the Buta miso which is made from miso and crispy pork discards.

* Otsumami 3 Kinds ($5) - We received bean sprouts, squid and seaweed, and bonito flakes and veggies. It was a little uninspiring. It does change regularly though. 

We tried ordering their Match soft serve, but it was unavailable. 

Overall, food was good. I would come back just for the Crispy Chips and Yamaimo Chips for sure. I would request light sauce or sauce on the side for the sashimi dishes, but that's my preference. I would definitely be interested to see what other specials they offer and any additions to their current menu. Service was attentive and polite. Water glasses were constantly filled and they worked as a team checking up on us. Love that.

Note: They do use peanuts as their chopstick holders, so those with severe peanut allergies should be aware!"}
{"text":"Frankly, after eating at some of the other restaurants at the Red Rock Resort, I lowed my expectations when I walked into Hachi tonight. I guess I'm such a pessimist. Well, I learned my lesson because Hachi was great, really great! I vibed with the bartender and listened to her recommendations. I was surprised to hear her steer me away from some of my first choices, letting me know the beef short ribs just hadn't been up to par recently. Thanks!

Instead, I started with a substantial Lychee Martini that was decorated with an edible orchid blossom. I was presented with an amuse bouche of tempura duck roll which was nice but just okay. The two kumamoto oysters that followed were tight and salty, served with three dipping choices, one of which was a gorgeous tropical fruit granita thing. My next course consisted of two short skewers of beef satay served with a crunchy salad of bean sprouts and (I believe) pea tendrils or some sort of peppery micro greens. For my entree, I had three succulent, tender, seared scallops in a light lobster cream with a cold pear and apple compote and some lightly dressed micro greens. I wasn't going to do dessert, but as I've been avoiding the stuff for a few weeks, I indulged (it is Vegas, baby) in a molten chocolate tart with homemade vanilla bean ice cream. The tart had a beautiful bit of gold leaf. 

Overall, service was friendly, generous and timely. Recommendations were sincere, not sales-focused. The atmosphere was fun, lively and a bit sexy. I may return tomorrow night!"}
{"text":"Decided to try it here for my b-day dinner. No regrets! Everything was cooked to perfection. Amazingly delicious food with various selections. Great service and clean environment. Plus, I love the name - Hachi's one of my favorite story/movie."}
{"text":"A great little Japanese spot, and probably one of the most authentic places that I have tasted so far here. The last time I had anything close was when I was in San Francisco. So props, Hachi. *clap clap* I applaud you. 

Ambiance: 4 - A rather small place with 8 tables and one set aside in a separate \"party area\". However, if you don't want to wait long for a table, there's usually some seats at the bar!

Service: 5 - Fast, friendly, attentive. Honestly the service was so good that I don't have anything to say about it. 

Food: 4 - Let me just list off the ones that I really loved: 

//Yellowtail Collar: Yummy, tender. Always a fan favorite if you love fish. 
//Chicken Karage: Fried chicken that is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I love chicken so it was one of my favorites. p.s. I dipped it in soy sauce ;)
//Duck with Balsamic sauce: Since it's small plates, they only give you one stick...but it is DELICIOUS. 

They are known for their yakitori, but they will also give you a small menu with their special items on it! 

All I have to say is..someone message me and tell me if their honey toast is bomb because I am dying to try it!"}
{"text":"Not much to look at from the outside. But appearances can be deceiving. Inside elegantly? furnished if a little dark. Our server was courteous and helpful. Japanese tapas, grilled meats and seafood on skewers, sashimi, oysters, both raw and grilled. Overall great for the ?money."}
{"text":"Still in awe as I write this review of Hachi. As a fairly frequent traveler to Japan, I can now say that I've found an izakaya as good as most in Tokyo. The only issue is that Hachi is in Vegas and not in LA. First heard of this place from a good friend that happens to travel to Vegas once a year. We were eating at Totoraku when he mentioned he was heading for Vegas for a little fun and asked whether or not I've tried Hachi. Now I don't travel to Vegas much anymore so I am slowly discovering hidden gems off the Strip.

Made reservations easily via a phone call and with a little coercing, Hachi was able to squeeze us in during CNY. Arrived to a fairly packed restaurant (I think I only saw a few seats open at the bar) and waited a few minutes as they cleaned up a booth for our party. The first thing I noticed while walking in was the yakitori grill full of skewers. I love how this place uses bintochan charcoal which produces some amazing flavor. 

Ordered a pitcher of Kirin and a small bottle of dassai while we looked over the menu. The waitress quickly brought over the drinks and offered a few suggestions. 

Started off with the yamaimo chips, crispy chips and chicken karaage. The three were brought out fairly quickly and all were perfectly fried to a golden brown. Out of the three appetizers, I loved the crispy chips (fried chicken skin) and the karaage. The crispy chips paired well with the beer and thought that it was perfectly seasoned (especially after a quick squeeze of the lemon). What I found unique about the karaage was that they do include some of the chicken skin which added a nice crunch to the juicy and tender pieces of chicken. Once again, a quick squeeze of the lemon added a nice brightness of flavor to the well seasoned fried goodness. 

We ended up ordering the hachi salad (to balance out all of the yakitori that would be coming) which was pretty tasty as well and wasn't drowning in salad dressing. 

Out of all the yakitori that we ordered (and we ended up ordering several rounds of it) my favorite few had to have been the beef tongue, wagyu beef, pork belly and enoki mushroom. Only complaint I had was that the enoki mushroom was a bit overly sauced during a few rounds.

As for the sushi items, we ordered the scallop carpaccio which was super tasty as the combination of sweet scallops, olive oil, yuzu and yuzu miso paired perfectly.  Only regret was not being able to order more since I wasted my stomach space at a less than memorable Hainan chicken rice place for lunch. The steamed abalone was also pretty tasty especially when they serve it with bits of the liver and add a splash of truffle oil to it!! The uni was super sweet though it didn't appear to have been from Hokkaido, it was tasty nonetheless.

I can't wait to head back here for dinner once again. Hopefully in the not so distant future. To the owners and chefs here at Hachi, please consider opening up a location in LA!!!

Oh I also wish they'd consider lowering the temperature inside the restaurant. Service was also phenomenal. Definitely do head here for dinner if you're in the area but I would recommend making reservations as this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. Sashimi starter was fresh and thick cut, tasted the sweetness of the fatty tuna, amazing. Wagyu beef plate was cooked perfectly. Katsu pork cutlet was tender. Offered winter specialty Oden soup, flavor was rather light; first time ever seen Oden in America. Quite a treat ! Honey toast ice cream is as good as it looks. All this plus sake came to $77 for two.

If you enjoy grilled salmon, try their grilled salmon collar or any other grilled fish collar. This part of the fish is super tender with some fat on it. The grilled fish skin is crispy and lightly salted. Hachi is the place I always take my out of town friends to, and everyone always enjoy their food and hospitality."}
{"text":"Oh, man...Hachi was absolutely delish!  The ambiance at Hachi was great...modern but sexy and inviting.  The food was just as good!  Too bad it's not closer to the strip, or that there's not second location on the strip (food for thought!), but Red Rock Hotel is awesome, too, so i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Charcoal grilled stuff on a stick.  Yes please!  

A simple and surprisingly authentic izakaya that focuses on great robatayaki plus a few other izakaya staples.  Yonaka Modern this is not.
 
Note:  This review is based on two visits and includes seasonal specials that may not be currently available.

Tip:  Order in waves.  Dishes are brought out when they are ready.

Raw - Limited, straight forward, and fresh.  Correctly graded chutoro, clean tasting hamachi and halibut.  The salmon and aji could both be higher grade and fattier but for the price, all good.  

Deep fried - Again, straight forward, no free ranged chickens or specially sourced beef.  The \"juicy\" chicken karaage is in fact juicy; cooked mid well, tender, with a well seasoned coating.  The ika karaage, aggressively seasoned but slightly rubbery.  If available, the deep fried chicken skin (AKA crack) is... suffice it to say, I'm salivating just thinking about the crispy, salty, goodness.  

Grilled - The squid, excellent.  Perfectly grilled with the right amount of charred bitterness on the outside and tender inside.  Correctly grilled, aggressively seasoned hamachi kama, salmon kama, and saba filet.  

Robatayaki - One skewer  per order.  Most prepared either with just salt or a sweetened soy based sauce.  No exotics.  Two choices of chicken (thigh and wing).  Requested mid rare and grilled to temp with no argument, juicy.  Crispy fat pork belly made better by adding the house miso.  Very good, thick sliced, beef tongue.  A squeeze of lemon and ahhhh.  If available, the whole smelt is good eats.  The stomach imparts a fishy bitterness that makes the rest of the flesh taste sweet.

Efficient and friendly service.

Well chosen selection of sake by the bottle.  Reasonable markup.

Easily one of the better, though simple, authentic izakayas in the Vegas."}
{"text":"Hatchi is a new favorite of mine with great food and awesome service. I enjoyed everything from the grill especially the ground pork skewer served with a poached egg. The jalapeño yellowtail and the beef tataki are great starters. Hatchi also has a nice selection of sake and cold beer. Try to save room for honey toast or the chicken karaage."}
{"text":"YardHouse was full, so instead my friend Mike and Flo invited me to Hachi instead, which was next door. It was our first time in this Japanese restaurant and I didnt expect anything special but high end prices that will be no different in taste compared to what I can find in Chinatown. But I'll admit the higher prices were definitely worth it and the servers were really friendly and great with reccomedations.

I ordered a \"lil sumpin sumpin\" roll which tasted really good. It contained tuna, cilantro, serano chilli, tempora flakes and spicy ginger sauce. and I also freeloaded off my friends dish but I can't remember the name of her order. Best way I can explain it is a whole small fish fried in tempura. Pretty good as well. I can't really comment on all the overall menu since i didnt order much but from the taste of the ones I did order, I'm assuming overall that all other dishes are delicious as well.

The atmosphere is upscale with good lighting and music.  However there was a certain wall decoration that stood out with a wallpaper containing cartoonish eyeballs. Just threw me off because the rest of the walls contained floral art paintings and pictures.

Ths place is a must try though especially if you're out on a date. I'm a cheap date so I'd only do this once in a while."}
{"text":"Hachi is a trendy, upscale, modern Pan-Asian restaurant/lounge that focuses mostly on Japanese. The orange theme and decor made for interesting eye candy. 

To get to the point.. everything I ate here was very very good. And we ordered a bunch of food too. The edamame ($5) was warm and salted just right. All of the sushi (Rainbow Roll -$12, Uni -$12, Eel -$6, California $10, Spicy Tuna -$7, Salmon Avacado Mango -$10) was delicious and the spicy mayo dressing I can't get enough of. The Yellow Tail Belly ($12) and Seared Salmon Belly ($8) melts in your mouth; fatty, smooth, and flavorful. The Kushiyaki (skewers) only come with 2 small skewers and not worth ordering. The Broiled Chilean Seabass ($32) was fantastic and their speciality. It was recommended by our waiter, Chris, and it didn't disappoint. The Calamanci Pinenut Tart w/ Honey Marscapone Cream ($9) wasn't bad. A little sour for my taste, but looked great. I had so much fun eating here and would give Hachi 5 stars except that we called to make reservations and they said they were full, but when we came downstairs to get a table we were able to get one. And also,  the prices are a bit high for the portion size. But hey, it's Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is as close to perfect as possible.  We have gone now at least 3 nights in the last 2 weeks!  The sashimi is the freshest I have ever had anywhere.  It is cut perfectly and served at the perfect temperature.  I love that the wasabi is freshly grated - what a difference!  

We tried the yakitori as well and it is wonderful!! So juicy and delicious it is incredible.  Everything we have tried and it is quite a range has been absolutely perfectly executed and delicious.  We especially love the gyoza.  

The service is incredible.  The servers are attentive but not hovering.  They remember what we had before and ask to see if we want the same to drink, etc.  

I love this place!!  We will go once more before we leave Las Vegas, but will be sad to leave this very special restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a bite before a movie.  The bartender was entertaining and good for conversation,  as I would expect in any more spendy place like this one.  The sushi was excellent (Salmon Roll and Dragon Roll), but the beer selection was limited.  I shaved off one star due to the fact that it does not have any beers on tap."}
{"text":"Justin our server was great!!! Great food, will always visit this restaurant, I will not get tired of eating their food. Kudos to the restaurant owners and staff!!! Please visit this restaurant, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Saturday night @ the Red Rock, where to eat? Well, we were looking for something with a short wait so Yardhouse & LBS were out and so we turned to Hachi. I wanted to sit-down and be served place for dinner before our movie started. It was our first Saturday night out in over a year without the baby so it didn't really make us very picky about what we ate. I do have to say it was nice to eat someplace that doesn't seem very family friendly for once. No screaming kids anywhere (yes, we have THAT kid.)

I decided on the tonkatsu ramen and the hubby picked the lobster tacos and hachi roll. I did feel a little tricked in ordering the edemame, it was offered to us right before we even opened the menus. Not something I would normally order when it can be cheaply made at home and taste EXACTLY the same (steamed with salt.) Ah, oh well, I learned. But we did order some french bean tempura with almonds. That was very good. Not heavily battered where you could actually taste the green beans and the 2 sauces they put on top worked well and didn't overwhelm. I needed something with a little crunch to go with my bowl of ramen, it worked.

Speaking of ramen, it was tasty. I'm not a fan of hot mustard (it seemed to be hiding in there somewhere) but overall, it hit the spot on a cold night. The pork was melt-in-my-mouth yummy. A sucker for some fatty pig, I split it with my hubby who made his yummy noises with his first taste. I would have liked the dashi (soup) to be hotter. It came separately and the server made a comment of \"be careful, it's hot\" while pouring it into the bowl, but not so much. When I get hot soups, I like them steaming so hot I always burn my tongue on the first slurp because I'm so impatient I don't know how to wait. (I don't think I'll ever learn.) 

The lobster tacos were laughably tiny. It would be the perfect serving size for the baby (if she were to eat anything besides cheese quesadillas and chicken.) The hubby's take was \"it was refreshing, but I wouldn't order it again.\"  It was a good thing he decided to order a sushi roll too or he would have been highly upset if the tacos was his only meal. The sushi was good, but I didn't feel it was something so crazy good I'd go back just for it. Now those green beans on the other hand..."}
{"text":"So of course Hachi was on our \"must-return\" list on our latest trip to Vegas. We actually ended up going two nights in a row! We ate at the restaurant Monday night, and then ended up doing to-go Tuesday night after seeing \"Ka\" at the MGM. Yep, in spite of the vast array of choices at the MGM, we went back to Hachi for take-out. And the waitresses remembered us from the night before. Of course we had to order the crispy chips (a/k/a deep fried chicken skin!) and the grilled homemade chashu. The husband is obsessed with this dish! We ordered two orders of the grilled chashu Monday night, AND Tues. night! Also tried the stir-fried pork belly with kimchi, which was damn good. The kimchi was not overly spicy, yet had all the flavors you'd expect.

Thank you Hachi for two more awesome dinners!  Service, as usual, was spot on. 

Oh, when we dined at the restaurant Monday night, the chef was awesome! I'd hear him say \"Delicious!\" and then \"Table 7!\" I asked our waitress if we were seated at table 7 and she said \"Yes, why do you ask?\" And I told her what I heard the chef say and she laughed. Glad to see people enjoying their work. But then, when your job is to feed such yummy delicious awesome food to people, how could you not enjoy your job?? 

Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Red Rock, how did ya get so hip? One minute I am dodging herds of teenagers at the movie theater, and the the next minute I am whisked into a sleek, too cool for school Japanese spot with crafty cocktails and solid American-ish Japanese, and best of all, if ya stick to the 38 under $8 it won't bust your bank (let's hope the secret doesn't get out to those teenagers!).

This is probably my favorite spot to eat at Red Rock because the menu offers a diversity that is sure to please a wide variety of eaters and because I love the interior. The eyeball painting makes me smile. If you happen to be traveling in a herd, their tatami rooms in the back are incredible, especially when the weather is nice and they can open up the windows. I would host a party there in a minute. Who's coming?

As usual, I found some truly stellar items on the cheap list! Vegetarians delight because of two of my faves are all for you: the vegetable tempura platter (it includes avocado and asparagus!) and the kabocha coconut soup with roasted pumpkin seed. The soup is the love child of squash and coconut. I have also had the basic mixed green salad twice. The first time it was amazing, but the second time the ginger dressing was salty. They were kind enough to remake it with a different dressing. I would order it again regardless. My husband has enjoyed all of the sushi and fish dishes he has sampled.  

And, I would like to make a special paragraph to note that they have one of the best green tea pots in Vegas. If you like hot green tea, you absolutely must get it here. 

I will say the noodles fall a little short for me here. They simply lack some of the deep flavor of a well-seasoned wok, so I would say they are good, but not amazing. I wouldn't make a special trip for the noodles. However, for tempura, soup and salad, this would be a hard line up to beat. And, there are some tasty, creative sushi numbers. Throw in a trippy eyeball painting and what more could you want?"}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN VEGAS!!!! People-  - - get off the strip, head over to Red Rock,....and wait to get you socks knocked off!!! Creative, Delicious, AMAZING food!!! I almost didn't even notice the beautiful decor the food was THAT good.....I would recomment the spicy popcorn shrimp, the donot-things for desert....the sashimi....omg, probably EVERYTHING if I got the chance to try it all...lol. Skip the steakhouse and spend your $$$ on a dinner and some fancy sake you will remember even once you get back to the reality of home  :)  Damn, I wish I was back there at Hachi RIGHT NOW! 

The Service is EXCELLENT and they'll make a couple of hours in there seem like minutes passed.....Ask for the server's recommendations and you won't be sorry. They all know their stuff."}
{"text":"Great Yakitori,  pork belly, and grill options. Lots of menu and excellent quality.  Service is great.  You may want to make a reservation on the weekend."}
{"text":"Hachi has a great happy hour. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. 
The food was delicious, the coconut soup was yum! The service was excellent and the happy hour prices were great!"}
{"text":"for being in the middle of the desert, hachi delivers melt in your mouth sashimi.
fresh, innovative, and absolutely delicious!
their sushi is spot on too!!
try their ginger salad.
This has been our favorite sushi spot while traveling the US.
It's off the strip but worth the drive."}
{"text":"perfect late night dishes with friends. Small portion and good environment. we tasted three different of liquid and all taste good. Price is okay. Gonna come back."}
{"text":"I've been her twice now and both visits were wonderful. We have tried most of the menu, everything is so great. I love the yakitori items. Service is about the best in town."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and have left both visits very satisfying. 

Must try the Yakitori chicken with cheese!! The chicken thigh is juicy with a yummy charcoal taste.

Pork belly with salt and tare are delicious!! I ordered about 5. :)  Also the Takoyaki is a great price for filling and tasty food. 

The drink menu is fairly priced. 

10PM- close deals are awesome! $Oyster! Yum! 

I definitely recommend this place for visitors! It's a great local spot."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and constantly changed but only complain is the bathroom it really smells"}
{"text":"An excellent sushi restaurant hidden in the slot machine jungles of Red Rock, with a very large array of $8 rolls and bites you might not expect from the classiest casino this side of 95. In fact, despite all the amazing decor, the place is very affordable with friends, even when bringing on the sake and the specialty selection of delightful sushi. 

All the specialty rolls have narcotics names, so when I say to try the 8-ball, maui wowie, LSD and poppy rolls, please, do so responsibly.  They can kind of be addictive.  Chase that dragon roll in moderation!

 I can't imagine what happy hour can do to one's diet or liver, but I only assume it's the best thing for your wallet. The service is always attentive and fast here, even on weekend visits.  The multiple sushi chefs always seem upbeat, which is always a plus when taking a bar-view seat.  A restaurant that has yet to do anything but please my group!"}

Located on Jones, in the same plaza as China Mama and Chada Thai, Hachi is a relative newcomer to the growing izakaya scene in Las Vegas' Chinatown and owned by the team behind acclaimed Ramen Sora it was with two friends and a four year old that dinner was enjoyed this past Saturday, the results a bit mixed but at times more impressive than Raku at a lower pricepoint and far less of a hassle.

Spacious in layout, a center bar welcoming solos and those looking to experience a limited selection of raw fish cut to order, it was at one of the comfortable booths circling the restaurant perimeter that our group was sat and with service always nearby, pleasant, and happy to answer questions it was after a brief description of daily specials that a bakers-dozen items were selected, several ordered in duplicate with the total bill tallying just under $30 per person.

Unfortunately one of those places to which \"coursing out\" plates is a foreign concept, despite several requests not to overwhelm the table, it was with a relatively limp and flavorless presentation of chilled omelet that the meal kicked off, but following this up almost immediately with two styles of fried crisps both the chicken skins and house-special mountain yam were lightly seasoned and virtually oilless, the first bold bit of flavor presented by garlic soaked edamame that permeated the air in a ten foot radius.

Underwhelming again with buttered mushrooms that were tender enough, though not particularly well displayed beneath too much salt, it was with the whole squid that grilled items began to arrive, the tenderness of the cephalopod's flesh found beneath snappy initial resistance as a kiss of charred lemon added 'pop' with or without the spicy mayo addition.

Surprised by the thickness of fried chicken thigh that was both tender and immensely juicy on a plate of  miso sauce imbued with smoke and onions the evening's most intriguing bite was soon offered by \"Cheese Chikuwa Tempura,\" the thinly rolled fish layer not dissimilar to the flavor of salt-cod beneath light batter with a gooey mozzarella interior.

Progressing to three items from the low temperature binchotan grill, all 'Out-Rakuing' Raku in terms of smoke profile and tenderness with the ground pork Tsukune particularly memorable amongst the group, it was with a bit less enthusiasm that the daily appetizer trio hit out table - the raw tuna well flavored while the rest were mostly throwaways, the daily special beef tongue marred by being overcooked by tableside searing, a Bill Walton quote-in-waiting about \"letting the show get in the way of the game.\"

Saddening the little fella at the table by informing us that softserve was unavailable it was nonetheless in two desserts that the evening called it an end and although the bittersweet panna cotta with an unexpected red bean core was a bit meager in portion considering the $6 pricetag, the $7.98 Honey Toast more than made up for it as the half-loaf was presented golden, buttery, and crisp yet at the same time still saturated with sweetness.

***Excelling with some items while fumbling and frustrating with others that seemed slipshod in their execution despite otherwise good ingredients and intentions, Hachi is the sort of place where a good meal can be had at a relatively low investment while a more memorable overall experience would be better sought at Raku for those interested in esoterica or Kyara at a similar cost."}
{"text":"what a great japanese restaurant for a station casino.... 

always make reservations... everytime we go it's packed.  i love the decor of the orange...it's so pretty.

it's similar to a tapas type of menu, here's our last order....

lobster tempura..$25. big pieces of lobster battered in tempura and served with a yummy sauce.  we always get this.

tuna tataki salad..$16. it's seared ahi tuna salad with an AMAZING dressing... its a bacon dressing and it's killer.  bacon makes everything better lol

miso marinated sea bass $32.... it's a small serving but it is wonderful.

shrimp fried rice...$13.  nice big juicy shrimp with a great fried rice.  

grilled new york strip $36... perfectly cooked... i love the potato thing that comes with it... 

we always want to do dessert.. but were always stuffed."}
{"text":"This is the best yakitori restaurant in town! 

When we walked into this new restaurant, the interior was stylish the sushi bar located in the heart of the restaurant and there's many booths around it, there's another separated area almost like a private room will sit comfortable for 10 people.  

We sat to the sushi bar like we always do in a Japanese restaurant.  Most of the dishes are tapas style and they are kind of dandy.  So feel free to order more! And dont forget to order the house special as many as u can.  

The service is superb and food is amazing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere awesome, service easily gets 5 stars!
food was GREAT, we were a group and order many plates to share...ahh, my fave thing to do-  Not normally a coconut fan, but this soup was special.. potstickers , yum... the ribs you must try... sushi rolls were unique and good... but I have had better... ahi flatbread was my fave! fresh food in all areas, ohh crab salad too!! Drinks rocked too..!!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this place.  Had great drinks, really yummie sushi I got the sumptin sumptin, and the coconut soup w/ pumpkin seeds sounded so unusual I had to try it. It was very good. I will say other Yelpers seemed to really like a couple of rolls that I did not find on the menu, so that was kinda sad.  They don't have brown rice, but I asked for light rice and they did me right!  We sat at the sushi bar so we could watch them prepare the rolls.  Had a nice ambiance, great music, and the staff was very friendly.

One of the better sushi restaurants I have eaten in Las Vegas- Nobu and I love Sushi are still 2 of my other favorites, but if I'm craving sushi I would definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in late night for their late night specials. The interior is amazing and everything looks new and the seating is intimate. I was excited to tried their grilled items since the menu boasted multiple times about their special type of charcoal used for the grill. We ordered the premium beef tongue and it tender, juicy and melts in your mouth and you can really taste the unique charcoal flavor and it was delicious. Also got the raw oysters and it was fresh and topped with the right amount of sauce. They do have have a wide selection of menu items and I will be back to try them all."}
{"text":"Great food ! Great Service ! Great Price! And lastly great atmosphere!
Yakitori at its best!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! The bar area is small but the food and prices are amazing! Happy hour is from 5-7pm daily. Love their french bean tempura!"}
{"text":"Do you like grilled beef, chicken and pork? Do you like salt on your grilled meat? If you answered yes to these questions, you will love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant inside of Red Rock Casino.  Kinda pricey but a great place for a date night if you're wanting to splurge a little.  The \"Top 6 Roll\" is my favorite and my husband loves the \"Jeffrey Roll.\"  Great selection of sake if you're into that...my hubby always tries something different each time we go.  Great selection of specials that are $8 and under to allow you to order a variety of things without killing your bill.

They used to have these to-die-for mussels in a spicy coconut broth but they got rid of them because not enough people were ordering them.  Wish they would bring them back. 

Decor is super modern and trendy, service has always been great and it's open pretty late on Fridays and weekends."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner around 7, Saturday night and it was the busiest I've seen. Waited almost a hour because we wanted a table.  The table turn around times took long but it all paid off when we finally got sat and food started coming out. Uni nigiri was a really good price and so was the Chu Toro.  One of my favorites was the crispy chips (fried chicken skin).  Their carpaccio were good but just too much onions and junk on top.  Hamachi kama was smaller then usual but delicious. Regular sashimis were priced well and decent size portions.  Recommend coming a little early to look for parking. Parking in that complex is madness."}
{"text":"You are lured in by the micro mini black dressed hostesses who may be young enough to be your daughter.  My first instinct was this was going to be another overpriced, underwhelming attempt at sushi.  After a horrible sushi roku experience, I have avoided Hachi thinking it would be more of the same.  Fortunately, that is not the case.  The sushi menu, although limited in the variety, has some very creative combinations.  The Smack roll, lobster, avocado, cream cheese, tempura shallot, teryaki sauce and deep fried was to die for.  And with large chunks of real lobster meat.  The EE roll was also delicious.  We ordered the rib small plate expecting 3-4 small riblets.  Instead we got 9 large, meaty ribs covered in a spicy teryaki based bbq sauce.  For $8.00, the rib plate was worth every penny  The two of us got out of there with drinks for about 65.00.  The specialty drink options are again not many varieties but what they have are  creative mixological delights."}
{"text":"Hachi is my favorite \"Go To\" restaurant that is down the street for me for my Japanese food needs. I love the customer service and ambience in this restaurant. Everything is fresh like their sashimi. I also recommend ordering the garlic edamame for appetizers. I will constantly be a customer for this restaurant non stop. Go try HACHI now !!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place . Fresh and tasty ... Ambiance was great . Prices closer to $$$ than $$. We will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"Famous Joey was the greatest waiter ever! The Sushi was delicious! My favorite was the LSD roll. I loved that the sushi was fresh and very tasty. The restaurant was very nice and modern and clean. I loved the atmostphere it was very relaxed."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi quality & service! And at very reasonable pricing. Well worth the 15 min drive from the strip. 
Enjoyed sashimi, sushi, some cut rolls. Also, the grilled chicken and wagyu beef skewers were outstanding!
Certainly as good as any LA restaurant japanese restaurant I've experienced!"}
{"text":"A solid Japanese restaurant. Have a little bite of everything, works great with a group when everyone crave for different things.
There are few items I really enjoyed.
1. Yellowtail sashimi.
2. Mackerel sashimi
3. Scallop sushi (the scallop itself was fantastic, great flavor and a nice sweetness to it but the rice was just okay. It fell part when I picked it up and I personally prefer sushi rice with a little more vinegar in the seasoning.)
4. Eggplant cold appetizer
5. Eel yakitori. We ordered few other yakitori items like pork belly, duck etc... Most of them are alright but the eel was excellent, the charcoal grill works great for the eel, it gave a nice smokey flavor to the fish.
I definitely will go back! Hachi will make it to one of my regulars."}
{"text":"I have been going to Hachi for years and LOVE it. 
I usually always get the Omakase. For a long time it was pretty much the same with only couple new plates updated over the years. But, it never bothered me because it was always top notch! 
Last weekend I was pleasantly surprised to taste an entirely new chefs selection! Everything about the night & menu was exceptional including the server, and the bottle of saki he recommended. 

Hachi is great cause it's never overly crowded, nor does it seem super pretentious, for more of a fine dinning sushi place. The giant wall of eyeball art always intrigues me. 


They also have some of the best oyster shooters I have had in Vegas. 

I have had a few things from the regular menu as well, and they never disappoint. 

In my opinion, much between than Nobu."}
{"text":"i hardly ever go to red rock since i live closer to aliante, but i was there this past friday meeting a friend for dinner & a movie. we decided to check out hachi's 38 for under $8 promotion. the place had a really cool vibe and the decor was pretty hip! my friend and i decided to order about 5 dishes off the $8 menu...pan fried chilean seabass cake, hachi vegetable fried rice, vegetable tempura plate, steamed chicken dumpling, and california roll. to our surprise, the portions were a pretty good size and the food was very tasty! the only thing that was a little disappointing was the wait for our food was a bit long, but it was friday night at 7pm. what do you expect!?!?! :) i would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Literally, hands down, by far, the best Izakaya style Japanese restaurant in Vegas. Staff was attentive, informative, and super polite. Had ebi yakitori, perfectly grilled. Grilled ika, perfection. Beef katsu with spicy mustard, AMAZING. Sashimi carpaccio, mix of salmon and super white tuna, BOMB. Saba (mackerel), to die for. Just go here. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Everything is good & worth it!!
It's affordable and delicious food.. It's our first time
And i can say that they have a Excellent service!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect.... the place is super clean and the staff is attentive. The crispy chicken sounded boring but was delightful! I'll be back."}
{"text":"OMG! I am embarrassed to say that I have walked by this little slice of sushi/fusion wonderland way too many times without stopping in. I must admit to skepticism when I encounter ANY sushi restaurants in the middle of a desert. Please understand, I have always lived in the lands of water and FRESH live seafood. Needless to say, I was so happy to find that this place is not all about the beautiful decor..... It is all about good food too. After reading the reviews from fellow yelpers, we had to try the soup and they were spot on. YUM! I could come to Hachi just for that in fact. We did partake of a variety of offerings and most of them were good to great. Highlights, Kabocha soup, Baby back ribs, Special Shrimp fried rice, Vegetable tempura, Tako, Eel, and the Hachi roll and a couple others that I can't remember the names. (That happens when you get my age). The only just ok thing was the Crispy, Spicy Shrimp. All I can say is I will mostly walk in instead of strolling by in the future. The ambiance is too lovely and the food....just plain ONO!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner there. Here's what I had:

Omelet. Properly cooked, flavorful, fairly filling, and cheap. 5/5
Tuna (middle grade since they were out of the premium). Very tasty. 5/5
Garlic tuna. Nice taste, solid item. 4/5
Chicken thigh: not quite as good as Raku's version, but an enjoyable skewer. 4/5
Beef tongue: not my favorite tongue dish. The only item of the bunch I would probably skip. 3/5

Overall: this is a bit cheaper than Raku and delivers some very tasty items. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place was just.. good.

Scallop nigiri was tasty and fresh.

The hama-something clams were really good, but so overpriced. Almost $3 for a single clam the size of a dollar coin.

DO NOT I repeat DO NOT get the giant clam. It wasnt even a clam it was like a fucking conch. It was super rubbery and tough, and had a nasty ocean animal innard taste to it once you got inside the clam. Huge waste of $15 and was a bit annoyed because the waitress recommended it to us -_-...

Tsukune was good.. didnt really understand how I was supposed to eat it with the poached egg so I ended up basically drinking egg.

The grilled squid was my favorite, cooked perfectly and great flavor and tasty sauce.

The pork skewers were meh.. nothing spectacular.

Bacon tomato and bacon enoki were both tasty. Cant really fuck up grilled bacon.

The chashu pork bowl was delicious, but they are pretty stingy with the pork.

Udon hotpot was meh

Unagi bowl was meh, granted I was pretty full when eating it, but still nothing out of this world. Also barely any charcoal grilled flavor to it.

The HONEY TOAST was seriously the highlight. I demolished like half of it by myself. The vanilla ice cream goes so good with the warm, sweet, crunchy, honey covered toast. The ice cream itself was really good too.

I left stuffed, but we spent over $100 for 2 people.. not sure ill be back any time soon with that kind of price point with so many other delicious much cheaper places there are in Vegas"}
{"text":"I normally do not like to go to Japanese restaurants because i am not too adventurous in my food choices.
This  s place has a very lengthy menu and you could try sushi or octopus but you also could order chicken and egg over rice which is what I ordered.
Very good food and nice quiet atmosphere
I will return"}
{"text":"Featuring the slow grilled method of cooking meat. It's their highlight I believe. The food is ok nothing special. It's mostly Japanese tapas dishes. I like others Japanese taps places in Vegas better than this one."}
{"text":"Came for their happy hour (which they call Ureshii Hour) which runs from 5-7.  Bar only seating, really liked the salmon sashimi (lightly seared for excellent taste) and special Hachi roll. Also ordered the Dragonberry Mojito, which was unique. Got there right before 5, the bar filled up at 5:15 so I'd recommend to get there early for happy hour specials.  Well worth the visit if you're staying at Red Rock."}
{"text":"I've been struggling to write this review and give it a star rating because I both loved it, then quickly afterwards hated it as I got a dose of food poisoning that required immediate bathroom attention. I'll give it 3.5 stars for now and when I go next time I'm sure I'll bump it up.

Went here on a Saturday night with my friend around 7pm. As usual, no place to park in this busy shopping center parking lot. So we parked next door near the Filipino place. 

Nice looking place. I remember eating here when it was a Pho restaurant a long time ago, and the space is nice with several tables around the edge, and a long counter area ala a sushi place, which they have, but really you come here for the marinated meat BBQ sticks. Menus dropped off and drink orders taken quickly. Our waitress must have been new because she had to go ask when I inquired about the pricing on the specials. Nonetheless she did a nice job even though it was kind of weird getting the meat sticks at different times and not all at once. 

We ordered:

Salmon belly special - lightly seared and served sashimi style with salmon egg and sauces. Since I was the only one who ate this it might be the culprit. It was good.

Chicken Thigh Tare style - very good flavor. My first couple pieces here were so tender that maybe they weren't cooked through because I ordered a couple more of these sticks later and they weren't as tender. This might be the other culprit but this stick was shared.  

Umeshiso Yaki - w/sour plum and japanese basil. These were just ok, I wasn't wowed by the flavor and didn't order more later in the meal.

Pork belly tare style - absolutely delicious. I love pork belly and these didn't disappoint. 

Magic Mountain - salmon and cream cheese wrapped by soy paper and deep fried. This was delicious as well, a combination of my two favorites.

Beef Misozuke - This was actually one of the very first japanese yakitori meals that I'd ever had as a kid. This version was so-so...didn't have any flavors jumping out at me. 

Garlic Edaname - I believe this is fried in butter and garlic instead of steamed. It was really tasty. 

Overall, I'd come here again. I liked many items and saw many more on the menu to try. I'm a bit concerned with the quality control though."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. 

Grilled mackerel is small, but the best item out of all our orders. Green tea panna cotta is definitely worth getting as well. I was bummed they ran out of green tea soft serve. :(

We ordered some chicken, beef tongue, pork belly, bacon tomato, bacon enoki, and tsukune yakitori's or skewers. All were good, but not mind blowing. Solid 3 stars for me. 

The beef tataki, tuna carpaccio, and seared mackerel were also good. 
Nice decor, great service, and good place for a date or small group of friends. 

I'll comeback for their soft serve, panna cotta, and grilled mackerel. 
Price is reasonable for an izakaya."}
{"text":"I met some friends for drinks and apps before we hit the tables.  Not authentic but more fusion-definitely prefer authentic Japanese like Ichiza. Apps were ok but nothing special.  Definite eye candy at door and  was very loud.  Service was a plus and drinks were strong which was a plus.  Prices ar high for being a local casino."}

{"text":"Hachi is a simply beautiful restaurant in the equally visually outstanding Red Rock Casino. Friday night Wifey & I were greeted by 4 stunning young ladies and quickly shown to a nice table in the back of the restaurant . Were offered water immediately and waited just a few moments for our server. Drinks came quickly as we studied extensive menu . We ordered a Top 6 sushi , which is , as you may guess , a serving of 6 different sushi rolls , we paired that with Sashimi Octet . This is a selection of , wait for it , yes ..8 different Sashimi. Served on a bed of crushed ice , this was a spectacular and tasty delight. With the Octet , there are 2 servings of each of the 8 fish. The server explained what each one was , but I can't remember that many types of raw fish.
It would be helpful if a list/menu/explanation was left at the table so a dummy like me would know what to order next time on an individual basis. I almost forgot we had Edamame to start which tasted fine , I guess it hard to screw up , but the portion was tiny. 
Anyway , am I going back? Yes , but I'm gonna feel stupid writing down the contents of my Octet for subsequent visits. Also , it cost $100 ish for the sushi and a couple of drinks each. No frugality here."}
{"text":"I am a foodie and this is my FAVORITE Japanese BBQ place in Las Vegas. The service, the atmosphere and the food of course is Awesome.  First things first....get the Seared Salmon Belly (if they have it...some days they don't and it is extremely disappointing when they either run out or they don't have it that day) I have gone there 8 times in the past month and i try to get something different every time.  The Wagyu beef is a must as well - the meat is not HUGE but you don't need it - the bites make you close your eyes and make food noises. The ramen is completely on point and the Sashimi is as good as you will find anywhere at the top sushi restaurants in Vegas. check out their happy hour menu (reverse happy hour at night from 10 to close is awesome especially if you are into Oysters."}
{"text":"Smack roll, yon yon cocktail, fried rice & vegetable tempura. Everything was delicious. Great overall value! The service was kind of slow, thou."}
{"text":"What a great little Japanese spot! From the same group that brought you Ramen Sora, Hachi is the new Japanese yakatori and small plates restaurant in town, rounding out the impressive and delicious Asian eats that populate this strip mall on Jones & Spring Mtn. 

So why is this place so great?
FIrst, the food is delicious. The yakatori here is so juicy and flavorful, whatever it is about that charcoal grill they have, it's magic! All the meats are seriously cooked to perfection. Tiny little skewer portions so you can try tons of different meats/flavors! My favorite is the chicken w/ salt and the tsukune pork.  Also, I'd recommend the bacon wrapped mochi....it's good, trust me!!!!  Their fish is also incredibly fresh. Portions are small, but this is a small plates kind of place :)

Second, the ambiance. It's a small restaurant that is super clean, with a fresh minimalist Japanese feel. Music doesn't really fit (dance music), but I like dancing ;)

Finally, the service is pretty good. The servers are very knowledgable about the menu.  Not the most efficient restaurant (took a while to get the bill), but overall no overt complaints. 

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Don't you worry don't you worry child... the outside may fool you but on the inside it's super cute and clean and just very modern!

An awesome Japanese style tapas/small plates restaurant. It's small but very decorated nicely and to the tee. I've sat at the bar area and the booths. If you want to have a nice time, come here. They have an awesome staff and play great music as well. Atmosphere is awesome! 

Now let's get to the FOOD!

The yakitori (I don't know how to spell it) is amazing and at a great price! I like the salmon collar. It's HUGE! I also love getting the tomato cherries wrapped with bacon, they're honestly really tasty. I've gotten the bowls and they were all delicious. Everything is a good size at a reasonable price and it tastes authentic and juicy! Definitely try the Miso soup as it is special there and has a lot of stuff in it and can definitely fill you up unlike the plain miso soup at other places.

Overall, this is a great place to dine in and bring your friends for small talk or a gathering. The guys that work the sushi bar are all great and super kind. You will definitely see me eating here a lot!!!"}
{"text":"I loved it here 2+ years ago when Iived nearby (pre-Yelping), and I still love it.  While the menu has been redone and missing some of my old favs, the new menu had some interesting new items, and thus, I now have a few new favorites.  The decor and lighting are really gorgeous, romantic and colorful.

Amazing:
------------
1A.  Salmon Carpaccio (absolutely amazing; wafer thin gives it a super soft and tender texture), with sesame oil, ponzu, and sesame seeds.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w

1N.  Spicy Tuna on crispy ricecake (great presentation, tobiko, avocado, chili; ricecake was too crispy, and while tasty, I've had it better many times elsewhere)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#lsZKgmNnGTA6yz0y6oo0xQ
2N.  Shishito peppers (in a miso sauce, all mild)

Meh:
-------
1M. Albacore Sashimi (with Crispy Onions in a CItrus Ponzu sauce; great presentation, but its more complex than it needs to be, and it hides the tuna...that's my goal for sashimi, hello!)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#KGCR_WyqmS6CdQvpjsSGwQ
2M.  Saki - Nigori Genshu (Murai Family).  I wanted a cold, unfiltered saki, and received a thick-as-a-milkshake one, that's sweet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4ugJ4F8jDJ9-2dEiZ47wLg?select=J0FFzxNuH4TF0jexP2tY3w#vRFiQLLbInhEkYdlAhr5wg

Service:
----------
Everyone was super nice, BUT, everyone I spoke to was newly hired (all less than 3 months).  Beside the manager (who was super and recommended the White Lotus Roll), the server and the assistant were very young and unseasoned, and I don't believe fit Hachi and it's lovely appearance and price-point. Plus, no Bernie, the girl with the dragon tattoo (see my earlier review, posted 11/3/2011).

Summary:
------------
Food is still a 5.0, prices are fair, and I love the decor, but the service dropped it one star."}
{"text":"Sushi is not my forte. The land where I come from rice is the center of universe and curry and roti revolve around it. I eat so much rice Sumo wrestlers follow me. I ended up with this place with trepidation and to meet some friends and I have become a convert for small cube shaped rice with sushi. I ordered Shrimp tempura that came with a chili sauce on a little white plate and it was the best Tempura & sauce I ever  had, so much so, I was trying to enter the kitchen to get the recipe tor the chili sauce and the Hara Kiri security guards stopped me with drawn out samurai swords.

The tempura which uses Japanese fine panko bread crumbs and the technique of using ice cold water to get that thin coating makes the shrimp with tails so appeasing I ended up ordering five of the appetizers instead of the main course. The bartenders in the front are morose beings, the kind who only take care of their usual drunk patrons and ignore others. Next time I will bypass them and order Saki from the waitresses who are quite a friendly bunch.

The eatery is spacious with booths that makes dining with friends a happy jaunt. I knew I  was not in a Chinese restaurant since the waitress did not say Enjoy or give any kind of warning. This is the best Japanese eatery in Vegas."}
{"text":"After watching a movie, my husband and I decided to stick around Red Rock and eat dinner. We wanted to go to the Yard House, but it was pretty crowded and they told us that it would be at least a 20-minute wait. So we walked next door to Hachi and decided to try it out. 

The lighting inside the restaurant is very dim, but I did like the cherry blossom décor. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She didn't mind answering our questions, refilled our drinks often and stopped by our table frequently to see if everything was okay. 

I honestly did not see anything that I would really enjoy from the 38 for under $8 menu, so I ordered the Seared Beef Tenderloin Medallion & Shrimp entrée. It was 3 small pieces of beef and 4 medium sized shrimp. I thought it tasted alright, but definitely nothing special. I didn't like the sweet sauce that was on the mashed potatoes. For the price of $25, the portion was very small and I wish they could have at least included a side of rice with it! My husband ordered the Boiled Chilean Sea Bass. He said it was good, but of course, for the price, the portion was small. We also shared the Molten Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream for dessert.  The cake was pretty good, but I thought the ice cream tasted funny!

Overall, I was kind of disappointed. Spent over $100 and we were still hungry at the end! For the same amount of money, we could have had a great dinner at Sen of Japan! Oh well, at least I can say that I tried this place. I doubt I'll be back, unless someone else offered to pay for it. :P"}
{"text":"Food was great! Price was pretty good. Service was horrible. They only had one server actually doing anything. There was a second server but she stood around not doing much at all. Had to request for our bill over 15 minutes after we finished eating. Took another 15 minutes after that for them to actually bring it to us. On top of that, they never cleared the table of our dirty dishes. Extremely understaffed, especially for a Friday night. We loved the food though!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. The sushi menu is not super extensive, but what they do have is awesome. Great appetizers too. I suggest the beef carpaccio. They also have awesome sake flights along with pretty much whatever else you want to drink. The staff is super friendly and even though it is a more upscale looking joint, they don't make you feel uncomfortable. 

Big ups to Paul and Ryan. We have seriously come back to this place just because of them. Will be back soon."}
