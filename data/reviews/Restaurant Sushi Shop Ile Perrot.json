{"text":"Do not waste your time nor your money here.. Tried their new Soup, it sucked.  The noodles were not cooked enough and once I lift it up, notice that it was still raw.  It also caused the broth to taste like chalk.  Once we compliant at the front nothing was done.. 

Sushi.. could be better, .. should of went to IGA it would of been the same or even better. 

Sushi Shop downtown and Ahunstic is better than this one by FAR."}
{"text":"Ridiculous place. I'm shocked this chain stays in business. It's basically take out sushi at \"dine in\" prices.

Portions are tiny and overpriced. Nice packaging but I'm not here to pay for packaging. I want QUALITY SUSHI! Very few traditional raw rolls - lots of rice paper wrapper rolls - trendy stuff.

Go across the street to Masako - same price for table service, excellent decor, and much better quality of food."}
{"text":"Great location amazing food, just pace your self the price does add up. plus there is only soo much Maki or sushi you can eat in one sitting."}
