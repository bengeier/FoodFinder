{"text":"Staff was nice, it was packed, and there was good music, but our actual hookah was supposed to be margarita flavored, and it came with no taste, I was with two friends, so we ordered three hoses, mine didn't work, so I asked a staff member to fix it, and they tried but it still continued to not work. Finally right before we left, the people who were cramped up next to us fixed my hose, and I still had to pay full price, which was kind of expensive. This place isn't too bad, it has potential, I'll be back."}
{"text":"VIP...riiight. Hookah sucked. Ordered Queen Peach and White Mint, pretty sure the mint was completely forgotten. Couldn't pull anything from the hookah. Had to wait 15min for enough smoke to pool up for a 'decent' hit. Microwaved spinach and artichoke dip with \"pita\" chips (more like doughy triangles: undercooked is a nice way of putting it). Service was horrible, no one came to check coals, the one girl (who has only been smoking hookah for a month tried to tell us it was us who were hitting wrong....like no, I've been smoking longer than you knew hookah even existed), hose was never replaced, still made us but drinks despite everything. Not to mention after the new management change everything is overpriced. Every party member \"must order or drink or everyone in your party is charged $2 each\" this didn't happen a year ago. Not sure why this is a new \"rule\" all of a sudden. But to be
 honest it's a waste of money especially because of the bad/trashy music. The \"music video\" in the VIP is a video of a CHURCH sermon. I simply do not recommend this place to anyone because of the new management. Should have gone to King Tut where they actually remember their guests and cater to them. I know what it's like to live off of tips, and Hubbly Bubbly employees don't deserve s**t. I will never come back to Hubbly Bubbly again, which is rather sad after 3 years of devout service. #duces"}
{"text":"I love this hookah bar.  It is fun, casual, and relaxed.  Except if you wanted to put your feet on the couch or the table.  I can't relax in those deep couches if I can't curl up into it.  The music can get way too loud but at least it is good music, and karaoke nights are a hoot.  I will recommend it more if it allowed a bit more interaction with lower volume during non-happy hour.  Happy hour is nicely cheap."}
{"text":"I've never been able to get into Hubbly Bubbly. There's always attitude from the employees and if you're not with a large group, you're practically ignored. I don't like that. I'd much rather go to Red Sea or some place I'm respected.

Even worse, the entire time you're there, someone is blaring crappy youtube music videos on the TV, advertisements and all, even going so far as to playing two different songs at once. Dueling sound systems are not my thing."}
{"text":"This place was really great! I loved the atmosphere and the comfy couches. I went with about 5 other friends and we were seated promptly at a couch section in the corner. I loved how we felt sort of secluded from other people. The hookah was pretty good. I also loved the DJ. He was playing mostly hip hop music which I love so we were all just having a great time. The price was reasonable but during happy hour it's half off so try and go during that time. This is a good place to go to if you just want to chill with your girls after a long day and smoke hookah while listening to great music!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but I've gone about 8 or so times and finally decided not to return.  As others have stated, the ambiance is very elegant, more so than your average hookah bar.  There are nice couches thoughtfully arranged, dark lighting with some blacklights, and nice TVs playing Arabic music videos.  At the front there is a small tobacco shop where you can purchase shisha, hookahs, zippos, and cigarettes.  On occasion I would end up there on nights when they had bellydancers and other forms of live entertainment.  

I started going when it first opened, and it was a very pleasant place because the owner was running it on a daily basis.  Now, however, the place is run by obnoxious ASU students with terrible attitudes.  The last time I went the place was very quiet, maybe two to four other patrons in there when my party (three of us) showed up.  We were seated at a portion along the wall on a three seater couch, all facing outward from the wall.  The location wasn't great but utilizes space well.  However, because the place was 90% empty and all three of us were larger guys (all over 6', one of the guys is 6'6'') we asked if we could sit at one of the numerous other seats that would be much more comfortable for guys our size.  Like nicole n., we were refused on the basis that it was \"going to get busy very soon\".  Well we were there for about 2 hours and it never got busy, at the end I left more than a little annoyed and told myself I'd drive the extra few miles to Urban Cafe the next time.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't mind that there was no one waiting at the cash register to take our money.  Yes you have to wait a minute, but to their credit, the employees are usually milling around through the place rather than camping out near the register.

The one big upside to this place is that they sell all the brands of shisha they carry, and even some that they don't, and because it is a lounge as well, they are open late.  My recommendation is to use Hubbly Bubbly as a late night hookah supply run location if you are given to smoking at home.  Otherwise, go to Urban Cafe."}
{"text":"My friends and I were treated soo badly here. We got kicked out because they said they were getting ready to close, and then the two workers there let people come in and sit and smoke where WE WERE SITTING.  I felt like we were treated like animals, and actually, the animals(birds and rabbit) they had there were treated better than we were.  I called the manager, and she said she would make it up to ME but not my friends.  As a manager, you make it up to the whole party that was treated poorly, not just one person.  I was very upset at the experience I had here, and never have I been so disrespected at an establishment."}
{"text":"I went to this location for my very first time and the atmosphere was great and music was good but when going to pay our bill came up to $32... when all we got was a one hose hookah and a smoothie, when going back in to discuss the price they proceeded to tell us we got a ice hose which we never asked for and charged us for a drink we never got... Even with these items the price wasn't adding up and they basically disregarded what we had to say and dismissed us... terrible way to make a living but great way to lose business"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my husband and our friend who was in town from San Francisco.  We are relatively new to Phoenix, and were looking for a good hookah place.  Instead of just looking on Yelp!, which I should have done, I saw an ad in the New Times for this place.  It had all of the potential to be a decent spot - there are comfy couches, mellow black lighting, and Middle Eastern music videos on big screens.  However, we will not ever be going back because of the terrible service we received.  We felt like we were intruding and unwelcome.  We were the only ones in the place at about 6p, and when we asked if we could pull up a chair next to a couch, we were told it would be a problem because it would be 'getting busy' (no one else came the entire time we were there).  We also were told the kitchen wasn't ready, but when we were finally able to order hummus (for $8.99), it was a tub of store-bought pita chips and hummus (with no plates).  When we were ready to pay up, he was nowhere to be found.  

It looks like there are plenty of other places in town so that we'll never have to give these guys business again."}
{"text":"Very expensive. Be sure to go with friends so the bill is divided so it wont seem as much. Hookahs hit decently. Only thing i dislike is that they use wood coals instead of standard coconut coals. One MAJOR problem is the service. They take forever to come around for new coals. Also they don't give you tongs to fix the coals yourself. So hopefully they dont burn out you hookah in 20 minutes like they did mine. But i have to say the environment is good. College girls and a DJ is a HUGE plus."}
{"text":"Been going here for a while. This recent time though we paid 5 dollars per person for the VIP room even though no one except one other table was in the entire lounge but whatever, rules I understand. But how are you gonna have a pool table that only uses quarters then say you only have enough quarters for 2 games??? Then our hookah burned out and one of the guys had no idea what we were saying when we said it was burnt he didn't speak very well English at all. So he didn't change it obviously but all in all not a great experience. Back room is very hot and don't go their to play pool unless you have lots of quarters."}
{"text":"haha this place is a joke now! i use to go here back in the day when it was \"cool\" and now when i returned the only thing that has changed was the higher than usual prices and gross food. I also think its dumb how everyone MUST pay 4 dollars for a cheap water bottle even when you don't order a hookah! why not just be honest and call it a cover charge to get into the place that you are already paying 30 dollars to smoke! They also don't do a very good job at ID people. So have fun hanging with 15 years old children and enjoying your night while listening to LOUD music where you can't even hear yourself think"}
{"text":"One of my friends and I favorite places for hookah, I would have to say we are regulars. It's very chill and relaxing. Eghh the DJ's can be better, and they just now recently started putting Hip hop music videos on the Tv screens instead of the arab videos that did not go with the music at all. The VIP room is okay, not much of a VIP other than a tiny room that is HOT and won't get as much service as you would in the main room. I tried the hummus once, not pleased. I always get a bottle water or flavored water, delicious! And great flavors and Fruit bowls to choose from. It's a great place for a group of friends, if you're going on a date...I wouldn't prefer it."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came in tonight, thinking we'd have another enjoyable experience, however we left early and very unsatisfied. You're Karaoke DJ had few songs for the age group your lounge caters to, and our server failed to inform us that the fruit bowl hookahs are not a part of happy hour. While the rabbits and birds sitting out in their cages on the patio were \"cute\", I have to wonder if the animals were in good health as they looked overheated when we left at about 9:30pm. We probably will not be back anytime soon, which is a shame since we've had many great memories at your establishment."}
{"text":"this place has the stupidest pricing ever. 4 fucking dollars for a water bottle and you HAVE to pay for that or pay a cover fee. the hookah was good, we ordered sex on the beach, atmosphere was nice. another thing that sucked was we got there, ordered our hookah and waited 20 minutes before i had to go ask someone to get it for us. we were there for about 2 hours and got checked on once by the girl. we had to get up multiple times to have people replace our coals. only really liked the music and atmosphere other then that it sucked. can probably find somewhere cheaper in arizona."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!

The servers were beyond RUDE. My friend and I arrive at Hubbly Bubbly at 10pm on a Monday night to meer our friends that were already there. As we sat down the server took my friend and I's order. They told us we had to buy a drink no matter what. I asked for a can of coke(2.50) and my friend ordered a snapple(3.50). Then she asked if he could put in a order for 1 hose hookah/watermelon flavor (12.99). The man returns with our beverages and gives us a 2 hose hookah with a fruit bowl top(22.99). We confronted the gentleman and told him that he gave us the wrong order. He told us that is was our problem and we just had to deal with it. (No I am not joking).

As the night progressed, My friend and I did a few songs for karaokee, in which we were told it was free. By the time my friend and I got up to leave, we went to pay for our ticket. He told us the total was \"52.50\". I asked to see the ticked and what he showed me was a hand written ticket that he made up. He charged us for the 22 dollar hookah, 4 sodas, 1 monster, 2 Red Bulls, 4 waters, and 3 dollar karaoke fee. I refused to pay that, since that is not what I ordered. He YELLED at me saying that I had to pay it no matter what, and that it was not his fault. He said that I needed to talk to the people at my table to figure out who owes what.

I gave him a 20 dollar bill and told him that I only wanted to pay 10 dollars twords the hookah and pay for my soda. He took the whole 20 and refused to give me my change. So he basically stole my money. My friend was forced to pay the rest, or else he wouldnt give back her drivers license. 

PLEASE BEWARE!!! THEY WILL CON YOU!!!"}
{"text":"I think the meaning of American style service is lost in translation here.  There are some serious attitude issues.  The policy of holding your drivers license hostage until you leave needs further explanation.  My license was never returned.  The message I left on their VM was never returned.  After reaching someone on the phone, I was told that it \"should\" still be there.  Maybe they are not aware that we are in a recession, and that people are going to go where they mostly feel welcomed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a lot of fun but its not worth the bad service. My group officially  said we wont go there again bc every time we go its understaffed and are coals die fast and hit week. They blow us off when we ask for new coals or take forever. Despite it's expensive."}
{"text":"As a born and raised Californian, I wanted to explore different states. I moved to Arizona and was convinced by a friend to try hookah. I knew what it was but never cared for flavored tobacco. I thought it would be nasty and taste like cigarettes.

So we go on a Friday night. As soon as we walk in they ask for id (they keep one persons id to ensure payment) then they seat us. Once we're sat they provide the flavor menu. Keep in mind this place is pretty damn dark, but they have lasers going on, so you can see. 
Only catch is... You HAVE to buy a drink (soda, water, etc) 

The furniture there is very modern and comfortable. They have high tables to sofa chairs. They also have a fog machine running, belly dancers, and music videos playing on a projector with LOUD music. You meet a lot of people there (that's if you're outgoingly loud like me lol) we met a few guys who were having a party later so it was a night to remember. Service there is amazing. I never tried the food there so I wouldn't know much. Pricing is a little on the high side, but well worth it.  
   I'm back in Cali and have yet to find a hookah bar similar to the Hubbly Bubbly. Definitely going back there when I go to Arizona ;)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time was whatever. It was crowded and apparently karaoke was going on. The second time, it was empty with loud music. I ordered a cream soda (because you have to get a drink) and they didn't have any. I also ordered hummus. When the hummus came out, it tasted so damn weird, then I looked at the container and it was expired. Awkward. This place is also too expensive for what you're getting. I mean, to each it's own. 
P.S.- if you are coming with a group of friends, be ready to give them your ID or a friends ID so they make sure you guys will pay."}
{"text":"I dont actually like or partake in hookah but got dragged as a saftey net along with my friend who was meeting a guy there for the first time. The staff is friendly and made conversation with us and shared horrible first date stories before the guy showed up,
They have a good selection of hookah flavors it seemed. And I thought the music was kind of annoying at  first but it wasnt actually too bad. They place is decorated really well and the crowd was very mixed."}
{"text":"1 drink minimum.  Shisha is excellent.  Bring cash to tip the guy that brings you coals!  They bust their butts for you!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to come and hangout with friends. Great owner and staff. The amount of flavors is hands down better than any other hookah lounges in Phoenix. You never feel crowded here. So many comfortable couches and they have a pool table."}
{"text":"Club feel, kinda goes against the relaxation of the hookah is supposed to give you.

Karaoke was annoying. The guy and gal who have led it (in the few times I have been there) love to hear themselves.

Service was slow."}
{"text":"Dark, so can't really tell if its clean. Some nights the service is quick others it feels like an eternity. Sort of feels like a high school house party. I recommend trying the smoothies! Which are the best part and try to blow smoke bubbles, but be sure to whip off the tip first:D"}
{"text":"Visiting from new york. Very friendly staff and popping music AND the only place around open until 4am? And to comment on everyone's complaints on the pricing, you're paying for the chillass environment for you to dance or do whatever the hell you please. Don't be stingy about few dollars just saying"}
{"text":"This place is sweet, it is open till 4am on fri and sat. A friend and I went there at like 2 am and it was till busy. It had lasers and a lot of cool stuff. Huge TV lots of people and cool stuff to do. When there ask for the bubbles so u can blow smoke bubbles."}
{"text":"If you go to Hubbly Bubbly, it should be for nothing more than the atmosphere. It's dark with multi-colored neon lights all over the place, it plays catchy music, and the crowd is fun and young. However, the shisha is not the best, and it is fairly expensive. The cool thing about this place is the fruit bowl hookah (you can literally smoke out of a watermelon, pineapple, melon, etc.), but be ready to drop about $20 on one. Hubbly Bubbly is fun maybe once or twice, but if you're looking for an everyday hangout, I'd suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not sure how to feel about this place... the service was good and the hookah was great. The place reminds me of a furniture store, but on a Saturday night it was much more lively than other hookah lounges would be. However, one person from our group said he saw a large cockroach and some throw up on his way to the bathroom. A little off putting but if you don't care for cleanliness, the hookah is pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times with friends. Fun atmosphere but the hookahs suck. You can't fix your coals.You have to wait for a server to come buy and by the time they do the hookah is practically burnt..They are expensive. I would recommend Memo's hookah lounge. Best hookah I have had in tempe!"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with some friends and relax. The music there is way to loud though you can't even hear the person next to. It ended up giving me a headache so I had to leave. The staff was very friendly though!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this hookah bar is pretty relaxing. It is darkly lit, with a couple of sofas strewn around. There are a couple of huge televisions, playing melodic Arabic music. So far, so good. I can't complain about the hookah or the service. The staff is friendly, and they even have a nice collection of hookah flavors and zippos.

If you're looking for a nice, secluded place to relax and unwind, I'd suggest the Hubbly Bubbly."}
{"text":"If you know me you know I'm not a smoker... but I did try hookah here once...very nice dark atmospher...

great Middle eastern music videos...I thought country music videos had beautiful women....

had some sort of cherry stuff... I guess good ... never had anything else so can't compare...

Got really busy wile there.. was with group and did take a wile to get service.. and like another reviewer said .. No one to take my money at the end..."}
{"text":"Without a question the best hookah bar I've seen in Arizona.

Everything about this place is intense, but comfortably so. The place is well decorated, which nice furniture, lighting, and music. Most of the time, the speakers and televisions are on a station called \"Melody Arabia\", which is apparently Dubai's infectious answer to MTV. Catchy stuff.

The crowd here is great; you'll see everything from college students here to try something different, to foreigners looking for an American take on what they enjoy at home. There is plenty of live entertainment, from your conventional DJ, to belly dancers to Ethiopian sitar players. OK, that last one is pretty weird, but it proves that the Hubbly Bubbly can culture you more than the vapid, dilapidated smoke lounges that imitate it.

The product itself is top notch, and can't be matched anywhere else. Sure, you can get Starbuzz at a few places, but will they make your bowl out of a watermelon? How about a pineapple? 

If you know someone that doesn't smoke hookah, this is your best chance to change their mind."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the service. My friend and I came here for the first time to check out the karaoke and they wanted $5 per table to sing and told us we had to purchase a hookah as well.  Ridiculous. We couldn't eat and sing unless we bought a hookah. I am never coming back."}
{"text":"I used to be there every weekend since I turned 18. My sister recently introduced me to a cheaper better place. The one issue I've had here was getting coals.....I would sit with ash on my bowl for 20 to 30 mins without anyone even looking to see how my hookah was doing. It's super expensive considering I pay 10 bucks less at my new place for better longer lasting hookah. I loved this lounge. But it started getting sloppy. Made friends with some employees but they ended up leaving and told me they were forced to quit. DJ's were always awesome. Great crowd but I go to smoke.....which it what I pay for....so not worth money."}
{"text":"Great lounge!
Plush leather furniture, great atmosphere.
Good hookah, fast service.
Staff was responsive.
Will go there again."}
{"text":"Me and my bf went here because there was a music performance there and we had a blast! The only thing stopping this from being a 5 star rating is the fact that they don't give you your own tongs. But the guys with the coals come around often enough to swap out the coals that it didn't matter too much. It was pretty cheep for hooka and it lasted a long time too."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the worst experiences at a Hookah Lounge. Our hookah never worked bt no one ever stopped by to check on us. So we sat most of the time trying to make it work, but no such luck. Instead all the employees danced around us helping everyone else. I will never come back here again."}
