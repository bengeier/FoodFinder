{"text":"Terrible. 

BEWARE the coat check! I was only there for an hour and they gave my jacket to someone else who described it. The food and drinks was overpriced based on the service and the ownership was particularly surly. Not worth the time, not worth the money. Plenty of better locales in that area."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN....

I went here a few weeks back with friends who know the owners and kind of call this place their's....now I have a wonderful time with my friends and was even treaded to my meal, but if I had to pay I would have screamed.

The only thing that was good was the wine...and they didn't make it (eek!)

Each item is a-la-cart and the sides are served up family style almost.  I had the Shrimp with chorizo  on a polenta bed.  I had the massed potatoes as the side because the waitress talked me into them....cause they were SOOOO good.....not in my books.....the whole meal was lacking in taste and substance for the price.  The potatoes tasted like a box, the chorizo was chewy and over cooked and the polenta was hard to cut....I thought polenta was to be creamy.  My friend steak was cooked from frozen and tough to eat.  He also ordered it with no onions, but it came with no mushrooms.

For after dinner my buddies ordered Espresso...I'm not a fan, so I just watched as they went through 2 rounds of sending it back and it was still crap!"}
{"text":"Church Street is definitely NOT the place for fine dining, and Voglie is no exception. Food is disgusting. Coffee is disgusting. Don't go here for lunch, dinner or anything.

The only time it's somewhat ok to go here is late night on a Friday or Saturday when there's music. Usually the music is decent but it's not great. Drink prices are nicer priced than the neighbouring lezzy bar Slack's.

The only time I go here is if my friends insist on going here and I have nothing better to do... which is rarely the case.

Daytime service is absent and sometimes rude, especially during Pride when they're automatically guaranteed the business so they don't feel like they have to be efficient or nice. Serving the two gay men that came in after me BEFORE they served me seemed a bit odd since I was in a lesbian bar (and I guess kind of expected my female privilege to come into effect).

Sometimes it smells like vomit (but only if you're lucky)."}
