{"text":"I think there has been a change of owner. There are no longer daily specials and there are now many (pretty good looking) Indian curries on the hot table. They don't have beef shwarma any longer as far as I can tell. The chicken shwarma is still good.

It's also nice to see the out of place anime posters gone."}
{"text":"Sindebad (NOT Sindbad!) is a cozy shawarma place in the area. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate (picture below). Chicken was tasty, portions were generous. Service was friendly. Their prices were reasonable especially for their daily deals.

Overall a nice place to walk in and get your shawarma fix."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, but the sauce was way too watered down. Seeped through the wrap without adding flavor"}
{"text":"I have to update my review because since the placement of the new menu on the wall, the daily specials & student specials have disappeared and the prices of every food go up by 1-2 $. 
The restaurant still serves fresh food but this place is not my favorite anymore since this \"joke\" was told to me by the owner on a Saturday. 

Me : Can I know the daily special for Saturday? (because they've removed the huge 'Daily Specials' billboard standing outside a few days earlier) 

Owner : We're changing the whole menu, there won't be daily specials anymore. Okay can you check that? (the menu flyer for delivery) 

Me : There is every day but no Saturday! 

Owner : So today is not your lucky day (laughing). 

This is how you lose customers"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible once they switched owners about three weeks back. The quarter chicken deal for students is gone, prices have gone up across the board, the people are without manners an have no clue what they're doing half the time. I am currently eating my last meal from there as I chew the burnt SINGLE falafel that I got in my wrap. Don't go here, that's the best advice I can give you. They need to learn good customer service and decent cooking before they up and decide to buy a restaurant. 

This is the first time I've ever posted on Yelp, and that in itself should tell you how bad my experiences there were with these new owners."}
{"text":"One of the worst food experiences I had in life. I ordered a felafel and a plate. After half an hour struggle, a team of cooks prepared for us something I didn't order !! I wish the quality was good at least! 
Super unprofessional! Lazy guys! 

I was so angry with the service that I wanted to just leave! I canceled one of the orders and got out of this place asap. 

The quality is not any good!"}
{"text":"Went there the first time. Had a falafel only Coz other things didn't look appetizing. Maybe Coz it was Sunday night. 
The falafel was freshly cooked- excellent

Areas to improve: attitude of the people there. Very dry, non-welcoming tone. No pleasantries exchanged. Maybe a smile and a greeting would have brought me here again. But with such attitude, probably not coming again."}
