{"text":"I used to work in the very first TenRen when it first opened in Toronto. There was a lineup because of the good tasting drinks (ok and maybe the girls too). This place tastes almost the same, but at an amazing price. 
My personal favourite is peach green tea.  I go there whenever I want some solid old school bubble tea."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! 
every time i go to first Markham Place i would go straight here to buy myself bubble tea. 

- its only $2 ! ( $2.50 if including tapioca/jelly) 
- The Drinks are the best!
- The service is the best. they are really nice =)"}
{"text":"There's a lot of competition in the court at First Markham Place where many vendors offer cheap bubbletea with tons of flavours.

I don't have a favourite spot but I can say that Leaf DeTea's bubbletea comes out consistant each time I get it and the milk tea special for $2 including tax is amazing...what I get when I'm in the area. 

They also have a deal with curry balls and a large bubbletea for $5; a great snack combo!"}
{"text":"One of the many bubble tea stalls inside of First Markham Place. They may have even been here when the mall first opened, since I've always remembered them being there (although they did move their stall a couple units over).

I've been a regular here since a couple years ago (6+). Having been open for so long is a testament itself to the quality of their service and drinks!

For only $2 you can get a regular sized drink with a wide assortment of flavours. They also offer a stamp card so every 10th drink is free.

Of course there are much better quality drinks that can be found in stand alone bubble tea shops, but this place offers the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This review is purely based on my experience with their popcorn chicken.  I haven't tried their drinks. I'm giving them 2 stars because I am still open to trying their drinks at a later date.  Their chicken is not fresh. When you bite into the nuggets, the colour of the meat is greyish brown and it tastes bad.  Probably the worst popcorn chicken I have ever had. It costs 3.70 so I didn't feel so bad about throwing it away.  However, for the same price, I can probably buy a bbt and would probably have enjoyed it more."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bubble tea place. It's run by a cute mother and son combo. Great prices and friendly service. They're so flexible with your orders too. Eg. Half sweet, half jelly, half tapioca etc. And their bubble teas always taste amazing. They also have a stamp card and other offers like free fish balls if you spend a certain amount :-D"}
{"text":"My go to Bbt joint in the GTA and have been going here for years. Fair prices and great service. Family run business that's different than your chain places that are usually over priced and crowded. You also get free fish or beef balls or grass jelly if you order a large sized drink. 

They take care in customized orders and offer different jellies (lychee!) with your tapioca pearls. 

It's a small place in the corner at first Markham place next to a Korean food stall."}
{"text":"I only tried milk tea with grass jelly, so I don't know about other drinks/toppings/food. Milk tea was just okay...You get what you pay for. I would pay more to customize sugar level because milk tea here is quite sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"One of the few places I can find pomegranate tea anymore. I have the Taiwanese Chicken Nuggets at least once a week, also comes with a full size green/black tea for $6.20 

Edit
Price is now $6.80"}
{"text":"Been here for their bubble tea for years - authentic Taiwanese drinks and snacks, at a very reasonable price. The bubble tea they offer is one of the most consistent over time. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The papaya milk is amazing! The family is really nice, and they've been at that spot forever."}
{"text":"A mom and pop store serving the most authentic Taiwanese street food/snacks one can find in Greater Toronto! My husband and my brother in law were searching for a light snack to hold them over until dinner. 

Despite over a dozen choices in the food court, they were immediately attracted by the familiar smell of tea eggs! 2 tea eggs and 1 small minced pork with rice - plenty to share for less than $5. 

Foods were exactly ones we had in Taiwan a little a year ago. Who knew we would experience the same flavors without having to travel half way across the world! Definitely will return to sample the rest of the menu when we ever revisit Toronto!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE for inexpensive snacks and drinks! The woman who works the cashier is very thoughtful and sweet (she saw that my drink had dirtied my shirt and offered me some napkins, rather than ignoring me after my order was completed).

All the food and drinks are tax included, and I absolutely love the $2 milk flavored bubble tea--you can switch it to fruit jelly for free, and even choose the flavors for your jelly(which often costs extra at other snack shops)!

In particular, I ordered my usual milk flavored bubble tea but with mango jelly and the jelly came in unique star shapes--which was a little something that brightened up my day (Or when the woman gave me my milk tea in a cute cup with pictures imprinted on it). 

Not to mention the stamp cards, where every tenth drink is on the house (any size/flavor).

Definitely my favorite snack/bubble tea shop to go to in all of Markham, I'd  recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Great milk tea!! it's one of my favorite milk tea to go beside Chatime and Presotea.  It is cheap and tasty compared to other bubble tea shops nearby, it's more authentic Taiwanese milk tea than other tea shop nearby.  I always come to get my bubble milk tea to go and get a stamp, for 10 drinks you get a free large bubble tea, worth the price and no line up too !!!! I'd recommend this place but make sure you come early as they close at 830pm :("}
