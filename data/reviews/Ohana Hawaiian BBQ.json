{"text":"I ate lunch here when my office was on Durango and it gets a little busy around noon to 2pm but the chicken and beef teriyaki is delicious and they serve Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"This place is alright I get the BBQ short ribs. Good price for a big plate of sticky rice and short ribs."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ and I absolutely love the food. However my experience with customer service today I don't think my family or I will be ordering from this location anymore. On lunch break I have enough time to order and take my lunch back to work. Thought id treat my family member and order for them to pick up already paid my treat.=) The cashier lady who has been at this location forever gave me so much attitude over it. I asked her if it was a problem having my family pick up their order and I took mine with me.... even explained I didn't have enough time to drop off to them because I'm on my lunch break!! She did not care she gave me even more attitude. Rudely asked me to sign my receipt. Feeling uncomfortable while waiting for my food I could see she was clearly talking about me with the other cashier while the other cashier looked at me and nodded. All I wanted was to treat my Family!!!!!! I shouldn't have to deal with this attitude as we're loyal customers.  Ohana......right. Well they weren't very understanding of the meaning."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!  Food is now mediocre and expensive.  Business practice is still unethical:  i ordered $10 of crappy food (spam musabi) and used a credit card to pay.  Without even telling me this time they added on the 50 cent credit card fee.  It's obvious they only care about money, not quality food or customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is great, cheap and they give you a lot! I always order the half and half. I can never finish it and have to eat it again the next day. Everything is good here. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. I especially recommend the garlic shrimp and kahlua pig. The cute Asian lady is very nice too! She's always so friendly and helpful. Try the Thai tea as well, it's very refreshing and goes great with Hawaiian food!"}
{"text":"Price is right. Portion size is right. Food is ono. I like it and definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Decent Hawaiian food. The beef isn't the best quality, but it's not a five star restaurant. More of a casual dine in or take out place. The macaroni salad is also very peppery and strong so beware of you prefer the milder fare. Very cozy place, clean, and the cashier is super cute!"}
{"text":"I'm not Hawaiian,  but neither was any worker.  I had bbq chicken with Mac salad.  Pretty simple but still good taste.  Also ordered spam musubi  bbq chicken musubi sausage musubi but ried only the spam which taste just right."}
{"text":"I've been a fan since opening, now they have added my other great food I love pho on the other side this is my spot to go!"}
{"text":"Great food, but terrible service. I called in a to go order, and when i went to go pay for it, there was no thank you from Lyn, the cashier, nor a you're welcome after I said thank you. And after I paid, she doesn't hand me the food, she just says \"Oh, your food is right there.\" I can maybe understand if it was busy, but I was the only one there. Someone needs to put a smile on Lyn's face."}
{"text":"I ordered the spam saimin...Im not sure what Hawaiian saimin people refer to but the broth is more vietnamese than \"local\".  Dont get me wrong it was great but far from local.  I was surprised to see a piece of spam (that would be used for a musubi) laid out on top of my noodles, its usually cut up into pieces but thats ok too...like i said ..the flavor was great!  We also ordered a combo plate, spam fried rice, one spam musubi, and an order of manapua.  The bun (steamed) was good but the filler meat was just ok.  I wouldnt order it again.  The spam musubi - lol i would hope no one would fail at spam musubi!  The fried rice and combo plate were good.  Im not a fan of mac salad so i wouldnt be able to give an honest opinion.  I havent tried the L&L there yet either so i cant compare but I will let my local resident friends/family know that \"ur there\"!!!  I'll be back again to try something new!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The chow funn was local style and so Ono! I had the pan fried combo and it was amazing enough for 2 people, the price is rt here and you get your Money's  worth. They even allowed me to bring my cat in out of the heat too ( who was in a cage) all u local people will love this place, I will def b back and with all my Ohana !!"}
{"text":"Greasy chicken, but white girl with black hair was as rude as anyone I have ever encountered. She is the only reason I decided to start writing reviews because of how horrible she was!! will never go back although it is 20 sec from my work. CUSTOMER SERVICE MATTERS!!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a long while. Disappointed in their Katzu Chicken sauce. It's like they watered It down and all the breading was falling off the chicken when I opened up my box. Still good but disappointed as it used to be my favorite place for Hawaiian BbQ."}
{"text":"Food no complaints. They have week day lunch deals 11am- 3pm. Monday & Wednesday: Kastu Chicken (#3) for $6.50 and Tuesday & Thusday BBQ Chicken #2 $6.50. (Regular size for the price of mini.)

Only negative is the mannerless cashier that has the look of dread of working there."}
{"text":"I got the number one it was a BBQ mix combo was really good for what it was almost fancy restaurant good try it out"}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews, I have to say that this place is now my fav for Hawiian/chinese food. The curry katsu was huge. The curry was not Japanese but a thai version which made it much better.
I'm going to make this my place now."}
{"text":"Comfort food. I'm not going to be as lengthy with my reviews as normal, but just trust me that you MUST try this place. The decor lacks. Not dirty, so feel free to dine in if you want, it's just nothing special. My husband loves Hawaiian BBQ- he went to college 20 years ago with a lot of islanders and got hooked. Me, not so much. But in an effort to compromise we have searched for places that have a broader menu. This one is hands down the best. He can choose any plate or combo he wants with the macaroni salad and rice, and I am sure to find something I truly love as well. My first ever order was the Fried Shrimp Saimin Soup. So good. I branched out to the sugared donuts (Malasadas?) and hey- fried dough and sugar, can't go wrong there. Finally the other night I tried their Garlic Noodles. Omg- I thought I had died and gone to heaven. This plus one to two orders of Crab Rangoon (served with their pineapple dipping sauce- not just any old sweet and sour) is my go to order now. It is just amazing. The service is friendly and fast. We live less than 5 minutes away. I have discovered if I call my order in advance, by the time I grab my shoes and car keys, I arrive just as my order is finished. Prices pretty decent as well. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Service is always good here. This location is much smaller than the one in Henderson.  

Food on a 5 star scale:

Fried Shrimp 4.5 Star
They give you 8 big pieces, not too bready like L&L. The mustardy tartar sauce might be too tarty for some people. 

BBQ Salmon 4.5 Star
Flavorful with generous pieces... sometimes.

Shrimp Curry 4 Star
About 5 shrimps, with potato and carrots in a yummy curry sauce. A little cincy with the curry though. 

Kalua Pig 2.5 Star
Dry and bland. 

Kalbi 2.5 Star
Too sweet

BBQ Chicken 2.5 Star
Bland.  

Macaroni 3.5 Star
It's much better than a lot of places but not better than Zippy's.

Musubi 3.5 Star
Where's the spam? Nice hint of teriyaki sauce.

Malasada 1 Star
Come on, we know your trick.  Pillsbury biscuits deep fried and coated with sugar.  

Garlic Noodles 2 Star
It was garlicy, but missing something. 

Chicken Katsu 4 Star
Golden Brown to perfection.

Manapua 3 Star
It's all bread and hardly any char sui.

I'd rather go here than L&L or Island Flavor any day."}
{"text":"Garlic shrimp dish was discussing frozen cooked shrimp saut√© in oil and garlic does not taste good leaves an after taste in your mouth, my wife puked after the second bite. It was awful."}
{"text":"My bf and I love hawaiin food and we always go to ohana by greenvalley. Today we decided to try this location because its closer to my parents house. Omg let me tell you this location has a bad customer service nothing like the greenvalley cashiers. We walked in no hi or hello from the cashier. My bf and I were confused and wasn't sure what to get. The cashier didn't bother to atleast ask us if we need help or have questions. Instead she was just looking at me. When we were leaving no thank you at all. We would never come here. Very bad customer service and cashier is snobby."}
{"text":"This place would be my favorite if it wasn't for Ross J's. Ohana comes in as a close second for me. I don't know what they do to their meat, but I can't get enough of the flavor their chicken has. I could eat their bbq chicken every day and for some reason, their macaroni salad drives me nuts. When I go there, I always get an extra mac salad.

The staffing is incredible. They are always friendly and courteous. It's a pleasure to come here for casual dining."}
{"text":"Terrible saimin. The broth tasted and smelled like watered down sesame oil, no flavor at all. No hot mustard available either. The container was only half full. If your portions are this size then perhaps you should use a smaller container so the customer does not feel ripped off.

The spam musubi and mac salad were ok, but these are hard to screw up. Then again, I thought the same of saimin.

I gave it 2 stars instead of"}
{"text":"My go to for fish filets and short ribs to fix a craving! This place is fast and the quality is great. Be sure to ask for an extra side of sauce for your filet."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The service is always friendly and quick.  The daily specials are awesome and at $5.50, one of the best deals in town.  Wednesdays the special is BBQ salmon and you get two or three big pieces of salmon and three sides!  For $5.50...seriously, how can they even do that?  It is really a treat.  And they have great boba tea too.  I recommend this place to friends and family a lot!"}
{"text":"I like to get the Garlic shrimp it's always really tasty and they give you the option to have the tails off or on which I dig.  The mac salad is good and the service is pretty quick"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to get your Hawaiian food fix.. From spam musubi's to the chicken cutlet. Place is pretty clean and another upside is that they show some sort of professional or college game if you like to just relax, sit in, eat and watch a decent game... Only reason this place doesn't get the full 5 stars is because couple of the cashiers have that attitude that they don't wanna work there or don't wanna serve you as the customer.."}
{"text":"I think it is the best Hawaiian place around. 
Always love the bbq meat especially the short ribs. They were juicy and tendon. The bbq source too was delicious. 
Singapore style noodle and the beef chow fun were as good as some Chinese restaurants that I had in China town.
Chicken katsus was done right. Very crispy outside and juicy inside, of cause, it will taste a lot better with either katsus or curry source. 
Pork belly steam bun was one of my husband's favorites. I like it too! 
Wonton noddle soup is now my favorite. I just realize that I ate the wonton noddle soup 3 times last week. You can choose different kind of noddle but I like the original one. Or just order the wonton soup without noddle as a side. 
Chicken wing was not too special...in my opinion. I can get the same anywhere. 
I have never tried the musubi or boba tea but these are my kid's must have items.
The price is not expensive at all and the service is great. 5 starts!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what is wrong with people giving this place 1 or 2 stars complete wackos, because my girlfriend and I have been eating here as regulars for 3 years the food is always excellent maybe some things slip but it's probably because the place is so busy has nothing to do with the food.We will always recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was great, great customer service was welcoming and made you feel like home will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I love their food! The BBQ salmon and Mahi mahi are my favorite dishes! I love their fish menu. The dish comes with 2 scoops of rice and the macaroni salad. Good price and good food. Definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good selection of Hawaiian fast food, huge portion at an affordable price. Wanted to try some of my favorites so I ordered a mini loco moco and a BBQ plate lunch.  While the food was flavorful, the marinade had too much salt.  The food was so salty that I had a difficult time finishing everything."}
{"text":"Loved it! Went here with my cousin for lunch. Had the Seafood and BBQ Combo Plate, 2 Spam Masubis and 2 Thai Tea and was more than enough for 2 people to share."}
{"text":"This place seems pretty popular but I'm not feeling it.  If you really have a craving  for local food then maybe you might go here, but really the food is kind of lousy.  Big portions, but no good flavor.  My katsu was kind of soggy, mac salad is weak and tasted of garlic powder, manapua is like the kind you get in the frozen food section at 99 Ranch, kalbi is average, grilled salmon is ok but the Teri sauce is cloying sweet.  I can cook most items bettah myself.  Depends how hungry you are, but the girl at the counter was cool.  And they have no hot mustard for the saimin and wonton min.  There's a big flat screen tv in there though."}
{"text":"Was looking for something affordable, yet filling during a lunch break when I stumbled across this gem. Literally all the food is reasonably priced, made to order, and full of flavor. They have a great selection. I like this place because they aren't trying to \"wow\" you with unnecessary plate presentations or over the top decor. The food alone is enough to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for close to 8 years!!! YES, it's always GOOD and it's ALWAYS consistent and fresh... I love everything on the menu... And the cashiers, I've seen at least 4 different ones in the 8 years I've been going to them--2 of them, surprisingly, remembers my name! :) I tried many other Hawaiian BBQ places but they are the most tasty and fresh...  I live farther away now but I still go and pick up my favorite dishes there! Spam Musubi, Samin Noodles {not overcooked} , bbq ribs, chicken...everything.. and it's not a long wait, I normally call ahead! Don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened and so decided to give it a shot. There menu has a good selection of various items. I decided to get one of their combo plates to give a variety a try. Went with the Hawaiian BBQ Mix of short ribs, chicken, and beef, 2 scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad - all for $8.25. I waited about 10 minutes for my meal as they cooked it fresh, but not bad as they have a TV in the room and the dining area is rather clean (you can eat there or take it to go - i was doing to go). In addition there is seating outside along with a few other eateries in the area. 
I'm no Hawaiian and I never have had much Hawaiian food but what I got when my food was ready was a box filled with goodness. Everything was flame grilled with that great taste of char and grill and had a tasty sauce over it. The macaroni salad was perfect and left me wishing i got a second helping. I devoured the short ribs, and got about 1/2 way through the beef when i felt myself getting full. Now I'm a big boy and to fill me up is quite an accomplishment. Especially with the tasty food I was given. I tried a bite of chicken and it was really good but wasn't able to finish.
I gotta try a few more things to go the full 5 stars but if i could give it 4 1/2 I would. A great place to get a good freshly cooked meal in my opinion."}
{"text":"Tuely enjoyed kastu chicken and curry sauce, must try pinaple ragoons.  Very generous portions. I find this food much better than aloha kitchen. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"In vegas for work which has me here for a month. i do what i do best when looking for a place to eat. \"YELP\"read a few reviews and i know the food is good so i decided to come in. Ordered my usual half chicken n beef and it was great. Place wasn't to busy so the food didn't take long. Cashier was nice didn't say much just got straight to the point which i like. 

I went here two days straight, told co-worker about the place and he wanted to go so I don't mind but ordered the Katsu. Yup it was good to so for sure anytime i'm in vegas for work or fun and craving Hawaiian BBQ i'm for sure coming here. I think you should do the same."}
{"text":"Kalua Pig is with the trip alone!  Broke da mouth!"}
{"text":"This is a unique Hawaiian BBQ location. They do not serve just Hawaiian food. Its also a hidden Chinese food restaurant too!! 

A few friends and my family were planing on a cheap fast but tasty dinner and we ended up here. I have to say that I'm happy we did. I ordered the BBQ combo plate and the overall flavor and portion size deserves 5 stars alone. This place puts L&L to shame with there tender and juicy meat, fresh tasting rice and mac salad. Usually I'm not a fan of mac salad and I killed the huge scoop that was on my plate! Its pretty awesome that you can order some great BBQ and an egg roll in the same place!

So why did I only give this place 3 stars even thought the food was worth 5 stars?? The service was terrible the night we went. I will have to defend them a little since they were pretty busy and the place was hectic inside but that does not excuse the crappy attitudes from the cashiers and people calling for you to get your food. They seemed overwhelmed and stressed out. 

The terrible service will not keep me from going here again as the food is honestly the best Hawaiian food in Vegas. There layout is a little tight when you have a large group of people but all in all I cant wait to have another combo plate!"}
{"text":"Have always loved and favored Ohana Hawaiian BBQ! Service is always nice and sweet and the cooks know what they're doing! I've been to Island Flavor, their katsu chicken is a lot more crispy/crunchy and I was not likin that lol. LOVE the salmon here and their katsu chicken and grilled chicken is delicious! Will always go here!"}
{"text":"In Vegas, which is referred to (in my mind) as the Lost Island of Ex-Pat Kama'ainas, this our family spot for Hawaiian BBQ."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been eating here for 5 years a few times a week. Thanks for quenching my hunger. Great Hawaiian and Asian food. There's something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Great food! Use to be my favorite spit for lunch until they raised the prices! Now, I only eat here when I feel I can afford it. i wish I could get more rice instead of the mac salad too."}
{"text":"One of my comfort food all time favorites.  I always get the Salmon, 2 mac salad and 1 rice, with extra cabbage.  I gave this a 4 start because although the salmon is one of my favorites It always same my salmon I can tell is reheated which is fine except for the fact that I would like it to be reheated properly so it was hot and not just warm with a hint of chill in the middle when I take a bite.  It's not a huge deal and I still eat and I always forget to ask them to heat it hot. Other than that It is always great.  Parking thought is horrible with the Karate studio next to it and another couple asian style restaurants on both sides makes for a busy area."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has a big islander community, so Hawaiian food is easy to come by. I've been to a bunch of different restaurants, and Ohana definitely stands out.

Price wise, it's similarly priced with other establishments of its kind. However, the servings seem a bit bigger than normal. I order the mini katsu (one of my favorite dishes), and can barely finish it. Don't get me wrong, your boy can eat. I've tried maybe 6 or so of their dishes, and have yet to be disappointed. 

I haven't had a bad experience yet at this place. The service is always nice. They greet you when you come in and say goodbye when you walk out. Wait time for food is normal. A coworker and I have even recommended that our office have Ohana cater a luncheon, and the whole office loved their food."}
{"text":"The best loco moco - excellent gravy!!  Had the spam musubi which is also very very good.  Will definitely be back to try all the items on their menu!!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Hawaiian food and I'm addicted to their Chicken Katsu Curry.  I get the mini as the full is just too much food!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food!  Thank you Brittany and your staff for the hospitality.  Will definitely make this my go to spot to eat if we are ever craving food from Hawaii.  Thank you for having \"Hot Mustard\" as a condiment. Some places do NOT have this, it's the little things that make a huge difference."}
{"text":"So I had the Pork Lau Lau & Pork Kalua. Food was to g. Had the Thai iced tea. That was excellent! Although the Pork Lau Lau was over cooked and dry which was a real bummer and the banana leaf even stuck to the meat. Bleh! That's why this got 3 stars. I've eaten here in the past when the owners worked in the kitchen & behind the counter and the food was superb!! I will order though from here again!"}
{"text":"very good hawaiian bbq chicken
i always order hawiaiian bbq chicken
its the best~better then any other teriyaki or the bbq chicken places
wont hurt to try!"}
{"text":"It's just so convenient.  They are so close.  This is my 2nd review.  My son still loves their chicken Katsu. 

BUTTTT.....  They are ALWAYS getting my other orders wrong.  Today in particular, I ordered for pickup over the phone.  I specifically asked for an order of Shrimp TEMPURA.  When she repeated my order, the girl said shrimp TEMPURA herself.  Gotta make sure since they've messed up on my orders a hundred times.  My hubby gets there to pick up our order, and sure enough, they give him Fried Shrimp.  She offers to give him 10% for the inconvenience.  More like a very bad miscommunication between the lady who took the order and the cooks.  Fried Shrimp vs. Shrimp Tempura is a big difference to me.  They should have offered to make the tempura and gave it for free.  10% off is an insult after numerous mistakes."}
{"text":"Ok so ive never had Hawaiian bbq before. The reason being mostly that i love real bbq, and what is served here is not bbq. Its Hawaiian bbq. That being said, i am now converted. I had the seafood combo with short ribs. The cod fillet was crispy fried goodness and the butterfly shrimp were huge. The short ribs had good flavor and were a great change of pace from the sea food. The combo also came with mac salad and rice. It is simple but flavorful food. I am disappointed that it has taken me this long to try Hawaiian bbq out. Dont wait as long as i did."}
{"text":"i was so ono for the loco moco plate. i ordered to go. when i opened the lid i knew it was going be junk!  the appearance look like slop.  i was so disappointed.  the hamburger steak was smashed down on the rice and the gravy just all over the thing....i should've taken a picture but after one bite i just threw it in the rubbish!  how junk....i guess now i goin back to island grill!"}
{"text":"Their Loco Moco not all that Loco good. The gravy they add is a little weird for my taste, it's not sweet or sour, it's more of a bitter taste. The Macaroni is decent. I also tried the Portuguese Musubi is good, as for the Manapua dumplings."}
{"text":"Their loco moco is on point! Perfect creamy center on the yolk and plenty of beefy gravy. DH's beef short ribs were the meatiest I've had in a very long time. Tender, juicy, plentiful, for the price of a $6 burger from Carl's Jr. You gotta love it!"}
{"text":"The pregnant owner was rather rude when we came in with our free Crab Rangoon offer. They had a sign on their register saying if you spend over $20 you also get 2 free egg rolls. I showed the nice guy behind the register my offer code and he stated he would have to have the owner approve it....what? I used the yelp offer code and she said I had to choose between the Rangoon or the fried eggs rolls. We spent $40 here and I thought it was bad business practice to have both those offers and no mention of a only being able to use one offer at a time. It felt very dishonest to me when she continued to say that we were wrong and it's one or the other..."}
{"text":"I just tried this place yesterday and it was delicious. Being from So Cal I'm used to places like Ono's in San Pedro, and hoping to find something similiar. Service was great, friendly, clean eating area, reasonable prices, had a lot of specials to choose from. Our food was served fast and comes in big portions. It was great and completely satisfied my chicken katsu craving. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to eat everything that I have tried I have liked. The spam fried rice is one of my favorite things. Great service with happy faces. Will return again."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly! Love the environment it is very cozy! The food is great especially when they have their specials. The pan fried noodles you have to try!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and parents here for the $4.95 special.  It changes daily, but the day we went was Katsu Chicken or Kalua Pork.  We got two of each and split them.  Both were very good.  The Kalua Pork had a nice smokey flavor and the Katsu chicken was very tender with a nice crunchy breading on it.  The sauce was sweet and yummy.

I also tried a bowl of the Saimin noodles, which is similar to ramen.  It had chicken, onions and a nicely flavored broth.

You will get a lot of food.  My parents took half of theirs home to eat for later.  The price is cheap and the food is very good and good quality meats.

I should note that this is the only location for the $4.95 specials.  I think they are $5.50 or $5.95 at the other three locations and they are different specials than this location."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here.  I like their chicken katsu better than Island Flavor's.  It comes with a better sauce & the chicken is all white meat as opposed to chicken thigh at Island Flavor.  The garlic shrimp is flavorful and each shrimp is plump. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian spot in Vegas :) I love it. My favorite is the Chicken katsu, spam musubi and the macaroni salad!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. The employees work hard but under staffed. My food was cold since it sat at the counter for about 15 minutes. The  cashier was taking orders, answering phone calls, and bringing your food out."}
{"text":"My mom loves coming here so she brought me to lunch here when I came home to visit. It was good, no complaints.  Lots of choices to choose from. Hawaiian, chinese etc. Food is authentic :)"}
{"text":"Excellent choice if your looking for a little island flavor close to home.   Mac salad-oh yeah baby!  Mixed plate was tasty and hit the spot.  I will be back.  Food:  Excellent flavor!  Quality:  beef a little tough in some spots but not too bad Price: comparable to other Hawaiian BBQ.  Service:  friendly
Thanks brah!"}

Garlic Shrimp, Chicken Katsu, Wonton Soup. (This is all I've tried so far haha their menu is endless!)

Deals:
Bowls - Curry Katsu, BBQ Chicken, BBQ Salmon, BBQ Beef

Customer Service:
A+! The ladies who work here are super friendly. I come in here often because my work is nearby. My coworkers and I have become regulars and I sometimes notice other regular customers."}
{"text":"We used to live down the road from this place and we hit it up AT LEAST twice a month. Soooo good! 

As a girl who spent a good chunk of her childhood/teenage life on the north shore or Oahu, I know my Hawaiian food and this place is bomb. Not much for ambience but its cute and clean with really good service. Their kahula pork is out of this world and their MAC salad is divine."}
{"text":"i only started going here b/c its the nearest hawaiian place near me.  its located in a strip mall.  its just a fast food hawaiian joint also offering catering items, which i would like to take advantage of in the future.  i usually order the mix meat plate...usually chicken katsu and beef short ribs w/rice and macaroni salad.  the chicken katsu is crispy and the beef short ribs are tasty, but could use some more kick.  my lovely dining companion seemed to really enjoy the pork lau lau b/c she finished that thing pretty damn quick.  it must have been tasty, but i question that she had to put a lot of soy sauce on the meat.  the portions are allright.  i think you get more at LL, but i give i am so glad they are right down the road from me.  ill be there a lot...."}
{"text":"i am a hawaiian bbq lover. Ohana's is a great place if youre appetite is on high! the amount of food you get for your dollar is more than enough yet again it tastes so good! other than just the normal hawaiian plates, they have various dishes to choose from burgers to chow mein! great quality bbq & amazing fast service! i eat here every week!"}
{"text":"Cashier needs a serious attitude change. I went to order one thing and she gave me the dirtiest look and said um is that it? Her face expression was rude and overall attitude! She's so lucky I was the bigger person!"}
{"text":"best chicken katsu in town and HUGE portion.  The whole thing feeds my husband, my 3 year old, and myself!"}
{"text":"I go to Ohanas for the chicken katsu often!! It is so filling you get steamed rice, some mac salad and your chicken katsu. They are very giving on their portion size so you could even share there dishes."}
{"text":"My husband was working late and the office ordered him dinner. This means great things for me. It means I dig in my 2011 Entertainment book for a NEW place to eat that has a BoGo coupon. 

The BoGo coupon at a new dining spot allows me to try two new things and as in this case with Ohana, saves me from making a single \"bad\" choice. Yay! 

I've never been to Hawaii so the concept of Hawaiian food and Hawaiian BBQ is somewhat new to me. I've been to Roy's and I have a Sam Choy cook book where I experiment with recipes, and I've thrown a luau with food from those recipes and gotten rave reviews of my skills.... but I've never eaten at a Hawaiian BBQ joint before. 

My first question to the girl behind the counter is, \"what is your favorite menu items, and what do most people order?\" She gave me two recommendation and that is what I ordered. I had the BBQ Mix and a new menu item, Garlic Noodles. I loaded up on BBQ sauce and headed home to eat while enjoying a chick flick on the couch. 

First up: Garlic Noodles. Honest opinion is to pass on this one. They were dry, sticky and besides the obvious garlic, lacked flavor. I love garlicky foods where you can \"feel\" the garlic, but this had a cheap, powdered garlic aftertaste. No bueno. Few bites and I quickly moved on. 

BBQ Mix: WOW! Lots of meat! Two decent scoops of rice and the \"Hawaiian Vegetable\" (per one Yelper's review) of Macaroni Salad. The rice was cooked well, and the Mac Salad was very tasty! The meat was full of flavor and not lacking in the quantity department. 

Worth the stop and try. Can't compare to other Hawaiian BBQ because it was my first."}
{"text":"I used to regularly go here when I lived in Vegas , the lady at the front is one of the nicest people on the planet.  I absolutely love the food.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"After reading just a few reviews of this place I decided to give it a shot. The cashier immediately greeted me while she was still with a customer at the counter as I walked in. My order of the Mix BBQ Plate was delicious and it did not take long for them to prepare. I will be back for other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood plate....heavy breading..mahi is on the menu everywhere...but it's actually swai..mac salad tasted funny..was hoping for some real 808 grinds cause I live nearby not like home...mac salad is key..."}
{"text":"Onolicious! Reminds me of home sooo much. Good place to grab lunch before or after work (in between too lol) I got the mini chicken katsu, bigger than L&L's mini for sure. Cashier was very nice too! Right now they have a buy one get one free boba! Milk tea is prime."}
{"text":"Went here and grab some to go foods.

2 cashiers and at least 4 cooks are working. The restaurant have pictures of food entrees in their wall that help customers to decide what to order.

I ordered Loco Moco, Malasadas and boba tea.
Got my order within 8 minutes. Fast service.

My family been here at least 20 times.

You can call ahead of time or order online, which is very convenient. 

Definitely a place to visit for Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"I came three days in a row. Their Hawaiian BBQ Chicken plate is standard in terms of quality but quite the bargain for the price. The BBQ Chicken Musubi is really good. The Shrimp Garlic Noodle has enough garlic to kill a Las Vegas vampire. A vampire in this context is a hooker. The BBQ Salmon is a really good dish too. I will become a regular to support this small business owner and to see the cute island girls."}
{"text":"I'm a coupon-attic! I got a buy 1 get 1 plate lunch free coupon from the entertainment book. Sadly it could only be used on a mini plate. That's ok, saved me $7 (wich paid off my book. NICE). If the friendly service don't have you coming back for more, definitely the garlic shrimp will do the trick."}
{"text":"This place has become a regular go-to spot for my girlfriend and I. We go here every other weekend, and we are not even close to getting bored with them. The service is spot on every time and the food has yet to disappoint. Their menu can be intimidating at first, but it just makes you want to try more things the next time you go. There has also never been a moment when this place was empty of customers, which I have always considered to be a very good sign. Although the menu is vast and they have so many options that are clearly NOT Hawaiian, they were smart enough to clearly label on the board which items are the \"Hawaiian bbq\" dishes. My two favorite things to order are the Curry Chicken Katsu, and the Chow Fun (chicken, beef, shrimp, or combo of all 3). 
Ohana has two dining options: you can go to the counter (the girls are wonderful and very friendly) to order and sit down or take-out, OR you can go to the other side of the restaurant and sit down for table service. Personally, I prefer to take it home, so I can stuff my face like a little piggie, but that's just me ;)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here about 4 years now. Here are the stars!
Crispy Kau Gee (add some hot mustard to these bad boys)
Wings = like 10 big crispy wings for $7, can't beat that! This place is a hidden gem for wings. Just be careful, they take like 15-20 minutes to cook so it's better to do a take out order and call ahead of time.

The Hawaiian food is good. The Singapore noodles are GREAT. The Chinese food is OK but I'd go to a Chinese restaurant like China A Go Go for better food.

Also, an interesting note, the FASTEST thing they can make is garlic shrimp... now these aren't anything to write home about... but if you're looking for something quick, they can get this out within 2 minutes if they aren't busy! -- I actually learned this by literally ASKING THEM what is the fastest thing they can cook :P"}
{"text":"Officially my fave Hawiaiian joint. L&L's chicken has alot of fat in it and they're generally more expensive than Ohana's. I've been to 3-4 different Hawaiian places in Vegas. Ohana's has stuff on their menu that other places don't have and the food is cheaper and tastes better. They have the special sauce for crab rangoon. They also have a deal for 4 manapuas! They just started selling their pulled pork BBQ sandwich (with a big onion and tomato and lettuce on it!). It's basically the same pork they would use with the Kalua Pork EXTRA TASTY! Their chicken teriyaki bowls and Katsu (not spicy) Curry chicken bowls are good too."}
{"text":"I have come here twice. Both times great food and wonderful service. Really generous portions. This is going to be a regular stop for us when we are on this end of town."}
{"text":"So, my new latest thing is Hawaiian food. I have several Hawaiian co-workers, one who just left whom I miss dearly. Pining for her Aloha, I decided to try Hawaiian cuisine, and I am HOOKED! In the past month, I've been to three different Hawaiian places.

Ohana is the location closest to me, so I stopped on the way home from work. Now, on the other two places I went to (L&L off of Sunset and Stephanie - it's a chain, so I don't know if I will Yelp it yet, and Island Flavor, which will get a big ol' Yelp coming up soon) one of my favorite things is when I walk in, I'm instantly greeted by a big smile and a hearty greeting. But when I walked into Ohana, I got, \"Hi, welcome to Ohana.\"

Oh. Well, that was less than hearty. Oh well, I shrugged it off. I ordered my favorite: chicken katsu with fried shrimp, and an order of pork eggrolls. The wait time was a little long but nothing too excessive, and when I picked up my order, I got a limp, \"Thank you.\"

Eh. I took out my take-out and headed home, maybe about 5-6 minutes away. I dug in, excited for my Hawaiian feast...

Continued eeh. Even with the katsu sauce or gravy or whatever it is, the chicken katsu seemed really dry. So did the shrimp, which is really depressing, because shrimp is amazing. Shrimp is the seafood of the gods. Red Lobster Shimpmania or whatever it's called is like a national holiday and I drag people out with me (Emily R. will concur).. Dry shrimp makes Baby Jesus cry. And the accompanying sweet-n-sour sauce seemed more like the sweet-n-sauce from McDonald's than from a Hawaiian place.

Not that that sauce sucks. But... I want something a little better if I'm not at McDonald's!

It was okay, but that combined with the half-hearted service, it dropped it down to only three stars. I will probably go back and try it one more time to see if I just came in on an off day. I certainly hope so, because the proximity to my house could earn them a lot of my money."}
{"text":"When I starving first thing it come to my mind Hawaiian bbQ super good and hot and ready in 1 min.:)"}
{"text":"This place needs to replace its front of the house people. Wish I could say I was able to try the food. We ordered and paid for the food, waited half hour and that was when they realized our order never got placed to the kitchen. The staff has no clue what they are doing... Even when we asked to be refunded our money so we could leave it took another 10 mins to figure out. Without getting us our food they still made us pay for our sodas. Really ? You made us sit here waiting all this time without food and you can't even give me my full refund? I don't Understand how this place is still in business!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day and it was a pretty good dining experience. The wait time was not very long and our server was really attentive. I got the BBQ platter. The chicken was very tender and not dry at all. I also had their spam musubi and their crab Rangoon. The serving size was a lot that I had so much leftovers. I will definitely go back and try more on their menu"}
{"text":"I had the short ribs. They were spoiled. Retrospect: The chef in the back looked at me and had a look like, \"Is this guy going to know if the meat is old?\". Took a bite and immediately knew it was spoil."}
{"text":"The hometown hero from durango and warm springs now has a location on rainbow! Order all the things, take home your go-to menu items and try the new chinese favorites. These folks have been serving the southwest community for years, so make sure you stop here for lunch because I told you to."}
{"text":"I wanted a loco moco and stopped by here since I saw it the other night when I went to 808 Sushi. I was hesitant about going to L&L's since the ones back in L.A. are gross so I decided to come here. I got the mini loco moco which was very filling. A hamburger patty on some rice with an egg on top covered in gravy. The gravy was pretty good. My egg was a little overdone because the yolk was cooked. It was good though but not great. I'll have to try the katsu next time and maybe it will change it to 4 stars if it's good."}
{"text":"Always friendly service and good variety of food. Glad to have them closer can't wait till the seafood side opens."}
{"text":"Head down Rainbow Blvd towards Warm Springs and you'll run into this little joint. Please don't drive past it because you will definitely regret it!

First of all, the place is clean... very clean. Compared to other Hawaiian food chains/places I've been to, this is by far the cleanest & has a very updated style (which is probably due to the location). Right when you walk in the cashier is smiling and welcomes you, gotta love feeling welcome. The usual plates and combos for a 

Here's what we ordered:

Mini Fried Shrimp (5/5) - Plain and simple, but very good. One scoop of rice, one scoop of mac salad, and a good amount of BIG ASS BREADED FRIED SHRIMP! Please don't be fooled, I'm pretty certain the shrimp is prepared fresh in house. It's not that lame frozen kind that others claim is fresh. Also comes with a very flavorful tartar sauce, I think they add a little mustard in it. SO good with the shrimp.

Shrimp Chow Fun (5/5) - I LOVE flat noodles, so chow fun is always a plus in my book. A big portion of noodles tossed with onions, bean sprouts, green onions & shrimp. The shrimp was also seasoned perfectly, it wasn't bland at all. Very good flavors!

I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Can't wait to try the other food here, they also have milk teas! Not your average Hawaiian chain, lots to pick from. Swing by & check it out, you won't be sorry! :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered kalbi plate (reg), chicken katsu curry bowl and malasadas. 

Everything taste was so good. Especailly Malasadas was soooooo yummy.  But the portion of kalbi plate was smaller than the portion in other Hawaiian places- usually there are 4 kalbi strips for a regular plate but only 3 strips in here. 

Wish they are getting more portions fot the regualr plates."}
{"text":"This place is literally my jam. That katsu curry is to die for and the portions are great"}
{"text":"We discovered this place by punching the zip code of the place we were staying. Great food and service. I had the shrimp tempura and the garlic shrimp with udon noodles and my boyfriend had a shrimp, fish, and pork platter. Large enough to share."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu Curry is the only reason why this is a 4 star and not 3. Everything is OK, except the CHICKEN KATSU CURRY! The service is normal, food comes out pretty fast, everything you expect for a semi-fast food hawaiian food chain."}
{"text":"Average portions. VERY greasy short ribs. OK chicken katsu. Mac salad is so-so. Sauce is very sweet. Price is on par with other Hawaiian joints."}
{"text":"Food is good and it comes out quick for being cooked to order... The cooks do an awesome job :) the girls who work the front desk are never friendly seriously would it kill to just smile or not roll your eyes when I ask a question... but once again the food from Ohana and the noodle place next door is really yummy lol"}
{"text":"Huh. It is Hawaiian BBQ, Las Vegas edition but to me it was pretty average. I wasn't expecting hula dancers and fire eaters to come out but what I ate was pretty A-OK. I ordered the Spam Misubi, which I will admit was pretty good. My main entre was the BBQ Beef bowl that in my opinion had way too much rice and I did pick through the vegetables. I know, I am Filipina but I am a weird one because I don't eat a lot of white rice. I am sure the amount of rice served is standard but it didn't meet my preference.

I will say that the service was fast and friendly. The restaurant is clean and pretty sleek. The prices were right on the nose with Hawaiian  BBQ in Vegas but what I ordered just did not WOW me. I am in the critical stages of trying to find a Hawaiian BBQ in my hood, so I will go back in, try something different and hopefully find it delightful enough to keep going back."}
{"text":"I love their Hawaiian BBQ chicken. It's so so good. The service is great. Some reviews complained about their slow services, but it's worth the wait.  The food is made to order. You can see the food being made from behind the counter. I don't mind a little wait to get hot food."}
{"text":"This my \" I don't know what I want to eat \" place . They have Chinese, Hawaiian , and Hamburgers.  Pick and choose.  Now really close to the house."}
{"text":"I eat at this chain pretty frequently.  I've fallen in love with their pineapple chicken option and will usually make two, sometimes three meals when I pair it with a few spam musubis ( you can make pineapple spam musubi ).
    Now thanks to yelpers today I gave their garlic shrimp a shot.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and tasted great, only downfall being the amount of shrimp provided.  Needless to say, for the most part you get a lot of good food when you order anything from here, but today's shrimp plate left me thinking, \"damn that's good, but that's it?\".  6 shrimp was all i got, now maybe if they were H&J or Boiling Crab size shrimp it'd be cool but that wasn't the case.  They were on the smaller side.
    Hence the 4 out of 5.  I still love the place though and know whenever a kanak attack lurks this place most often than not satisfies.  Food is ono, service good, portions tend to be ample... just not today, but yeah lol"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Los Angeles to get the \"Garlic Albacore\" roll! Awesome food and even better service!!!"}
{"text":"Ohana Hawaiian BBQ Noodles houses two rooms that is befitting for customers who would like to either dine-in or go for take-out. I notice there are two entrance, but I didn't know which door to go. It just so happens I see someone walking towards the entrance to the right. So I went to the right door. There are plenty of tables and seatings on both sides of the room. I notice more people going for the right door and I realize that if you choose this door, expect your order to be serve in a take-out box. But if you want to have a good feel of dining in, looking at the pretty menu, and enjoying your meal on a nice plate accompanied with a silverware, enter the left door. 

The menu is quite extensive. They offer a selection of rice dish, BBQ combo, burger, sandwich, masubi, all kinds of meat, and noodle dish. There is a picturesque wall of food to help with decision-making and to alleviate some of the pressure from guessing what your meal will look like. I chose the Singapore Rice Noodles ($9.25) which usually comes with spam and shrimp. Now as a person with specific food allergy, it is good seeing that this restaurant can accommodate to special request. I wanted to try the Singapore Rice Noodles with just chicken. This meal comes with a nice, spicy curry flavor and is serve with thin rice vermicelli noodles stir fry with onions, green bell pepper, slice carrots, bean sprouts, scramble egg, chop scallions, and generous portion of tender chicken which taste so soft it just melts in your mouth. This specific dish has my favorite kind of noodle and the food is so good and flavorful, I had to save up the rest so I can enjoy more of this deliciousness at home. 

The atmosphere is lively, casual, and laid-back, and the songs playing in the background are a mix of R&B, Alternative Rock, and Pop. The service is welcoming and friendly, and the people who have attended to my order are Kiana and John. Both have shown sincere kindness, a warmth smile, cheerful disposition, and excellent hospitality. I forgot to get my drink and John had filled my cup and personally brought it to my table, which I feel is the nicest gesture. You can tell there is a lot of love and dedication by how people treat you. The service is very much family-oriented and the moment you place an order, the staff is attentive and ready to make your meal with fresh quality ingredients. On top of my order, I had the Malasadas ($5.50) for dessert and this is a simple treat that I am familiar with in my culture. Malasadas is a deep-fried, round and puffy doughnut that is rolled and coated in granulated sugar. It is the good kind of sweet that you can most certainly share and enjoy in bounty with others."}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect for the price! I've been here a few dozen times and have never been let down.  Friendly service with a smile too  :)"}
{"text":"Legit Hawaiian food/plate lunch. We tried a couple of things (chicken katsu, combo fried rice & spam musubi). Delicious Mac salad. The spam in the musubi was hot, crispy & fresh. The fried rice was great too. Great prices, portions, & customer service. We loved it all."}
{"text":"so many great things to say about the experiences we have had here. we recently moved to Las Vegas and was missing the \"local\" food and this place came up on yelp. so we gave it a try.

and we were NOT disappointed. I think we have eaten here at least 10 times already.

some of my favorites include; Minute Chicken with Cake Noodle, crispy Gau Gee, Chicken Katsu, of course the spam musubi, kalbi, the pho is even pretty good!

as far as service, they have GREAT customer service. whether eating in or taking out, it has been a great experience. plus the prices are very reasonable.

I'd highly recommend trying out Ohana BBQ!"}
{"text":"I actually ended up with a food poisoning after eating their Katsu.. sooo I won't go here again."}
{"text":"Definitely my fav spot for Hawaiian food. It's also a good happy medium for the hubby and I because they have Vietnamese noodles as well. So he can get his pho and I can get my saimen and we are a happy happy couple! What's cool about this spot is they have two sides. One side is a walk up window where you can order to go, and then the noodles are served on the other side which is a sit down atmosphere. So whether we are in a rush and want to take food home, or if we want to sit down for a family meal, we can have both here. The girls working the noodle side are always super friendly and helpful. I haven't ordered to go from here yet so I can't speak on that side, but I'm sure they're great too. Oh and the spam fried rice is amaaaazing."}
{"text":"I work close by and I've been coming on and off for over 4 years now. Sadly, they still have not set a good system for promptly bringing the food out or in order. 

I was craving for gyoza today and I walked in to a fairly empty place. I was pretty stoked since I only have an hour for lunch and I knew ordering gyoza will not be a long wait at all. Well, I was dead wrong.

It got pretty crowded after I ordered. I sat down and 10-15 mins passed, I realized that people who ordered after me got their meals first. Mind you, these are actual meals with rice, mac salad, meat, etc. Two people came in and seemed to know the workers and ordered a bunch of stuff and they got their food so fast!

I waited 30 mins for my order of gyoza and they weren't even pan seared as well as they used to be. Everybody after me got their large orders and I was still sitting down. They only grabbed my order when I stood up from my chair. 

Guys, please figure out a better system. Don't treat customers more kindly than others just because you know them personally. I haven't written a bad review for them the past years just because I kept giving them more chances but this is the last straw. I'll take my business elsewhere despite this place being close to work."}
{"text":"I love the variety of options here. My personal fave is the S&P pork chops. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Their portions are what you would expect from an Ohana BBQ which is great. I ordered the katsu curry and had plenty of leftovers to last me at least another full meal.  The only downside is that their curry is more like green curry you'd get from a Thai restaurant rather than Japanese curry.  I'm used to Japanese curry at Hawaiian restaurants and was really looking forward to that flavor, so I was disappointed.  Their kimchi is good, and the service was friendly.   Will probably go back again, just not for katsu curry. :P"}
{"text":"Eh... this place is so so. I think I am pretty bias though, since I have been a fan of a particular hawaiian place since college. The saimin soup is a 3-star... spam misubi is a 3.5 star. The beef teri is 3 star. Nothing that really stuck out to me. But It is overall a decent place and affordable."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Hawaiian food you will ever have! I've been eating here for ATLEAST 2 years now. The service is quick, and friendly. The manager is super sweet and so are all the workers. I'd personally say it's way better then L&L. Every time I eat at another Hawaiian spot, I wish I woulda went too Ohana instead. There is 3 locations, available for pick up and delivery also. If you're in Vegas you have to check them out! Yummmmmmyyy!!!!"}
{"text":"I actually really love it here because of price and how many options there are. I've come here with 5 other members of my family when we were all craving different things.

The main food item I keep coming back for are the grilled pork belly buns. Seriously. It's amazing. They give you 5 pieces of grilled pork belly, five pieces of bread and cucumbers. onions, lettuce and hoisin sauce to fill it however you want. 

The reason it gets 4/5 stars is because the pho lacks in flavor and the calamari rings had too much breading.

Service is pretty good here. Super friendly servers & quick!"}
{"text":"Really hate all these wannabe Hawaiian places who  say aloha as you enter there place of business, but in Hawaii you never ever hear them say that....
 secondly when you order hot saimin with spam.  ..thus place don't cut da spam in slices....cause we think people like it one whole piece....and by day way the picture just right of the register SHOWS IT SLICED????? What up with that?????
food was okey...but not to filling.

Alohaaaaaa and better luck next time."}
{"text":"Nice spot for Hawaiian bbq, or some lunch fine ramen. I eat lunch here once a month. Great food"}
{"text":"I enjoy Hawaiian BBQ and this place has some of the best in the city. The place is small and cozy, but very clean. The staff are friendly and brings your food to you when you eat in. The food is affordable and enough for 2 to share. The beef is a little on the salty side but still good, the macaroni salad is my favorite. Their pot stickers are super yummy, every time i eat there i have to get an order. I have been curious to try their pineapple crab ragoon, but have not been brave enough yet. I enjoy eating here because the food is made fresh and they are never over crowded."}
{"text":"Was on this side of town and dropped in for a quick bite.

I have eaten at the Ohana in Henderson and thought this establishment would very much be the same.

It was not.

The girl behind the cash register was not very friendly nor helpful as I stalled out staring at the menu.

The picture of the Siamin caught my eye and I ordered it.

What I received was nothing like the picture. It was the most alohaless thing I have ever tasted.  This made me very sad."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted because I'm not sure if I just don't dig Hawaiian food or if it's just this place. The malasadas were A1 though, so they've got that going for them in my book. 

I've actually visited Hawaii a few times and ate there...I enjoyed the food during my visit. I was craving some Hawaiian food and decided to try this place. It was simply OKAY. The chicken that I ordered didn't seem all the way done, but perhaps it was a fluke? Not sure. The rice and mac salad were both tasty. The fish that I ordered was good, the batter that they use was tasty!

The wait time wasn't extremely long...though, we did have enough time to visit another place to order food (for the boyfriend). The service was...quick. Seemed like everyone was in a hurry. 

I am willing to give this place another try... scratch that, I want to give this place another try. So I will update then... but for now, it was simply \"okay.\""}
{"text":"Great to go food!!! Large portions make it easy to feed big groups! Friendly staff and it was ready quickly."}
{"text":"I used to eat at L & L until I discovered this amazing place! Don't get me wrong, LL is good, but Ohana is really good!! It comes down down to flavor. Their seasoning game is in point. Now when I want Hawaiian bbq, I only go here. My favorite: The Loco Moco."}
{"text":"Was our with the Boy & GF and stopped in for a bite while on the way home.  We arrived about 20 minutes before closing time.  Not wanting to deal with styrofoam monsoon, that seems to come with take-out, I asked if it would be cool if we could quickly eat inside the restaurant. The girl behind the counter did not seem to have a problem wit it.  I was stoked!

I ordered up some Chicken Katsu in a Curry sauce, it's been something that I have been wanting to try for awhile now.

We prepped or table for the feast the come and when it did it came wrapped up neatly in a plastic bag..???... \"Oh\" I said.  \"I thought that you said that we could eat here?\"  \"We are closing\" was the reply.

I did not get wrapped around the axil about it.  I understand when you want to close shop and head home.  BUT...the GF heard the same thing I did and she has a much better memory than I do.

No biggy..we rolled out and over to the outside dinning area next to SB's.  It was a little chilly outside not big deal.

So they plastic bag is ripped open and chow is dispersed.  I consume probably one the best Chicken Katsu with \"Gravy?\" DAMN! no curry sauce! After a few more bites, I forgot all about it and enjoyed the succulent, homey compliments of the gravy, crispy chicken, rice and mac."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. We took a suggestion from Rick at Bass Pro Shop (if you see him say mahalo) to eat at this place and wow what a gem! The servers are incredibly friendly and helpful. The restaurant is vey clean. And the food, hands down best Hawaiian food I've had. We got the chicken katsu and the tonkutsu ramen and I can't decide which was better. First the katsu- huge portion, HUGE. Super crispy and comes with rice and Mac salad. The tonkutsu was creamy, spicy (with chili flakes) and also huge portion for ramen. I will definitely add this to my go to place whenever I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was very displeased. First thing I notice was the large menu that speared all across the walls.  I ordered orange chicken which was bland and some fried rice that was just okay. Long wait time to get food."}
{"text":"Love this place, they always satisfy the Hawaii fix when I need a local plate lunch!!! The Bbq chicken, loco moco, and chicken katsu Just to name a few! They have lots of food here to satisfy any craving. The spam musubi is a great side order, grab two if your hungry!!! They do cater but they need at least 24hr notice if you have a big order....."}
{"text":"I give one star, not because the food was bad. In fact we didn't get a chance to try the food. Walked in and they said, \"no more orders.\"  That's bad when you're open for 20 more minutes. 
Its hard to earn new customers and we probably won't go out of our way to come back"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service!  The store is clean and prices of their food is about right.  Its a fusion of hawaiian and chinese foods.  Lots of good entry to choose from, it will not break the bank to treat the whole family!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but not the best. I usually get a Loco Moco, BBQ mix, or Katsu/Cutlet, with the occasional spam musubi. I recommend getting a regular size meal over the mini, because it really is mini. The regular sizes are about double the size of the mini for about a dollar more.

Its a small place, not really ideal for a family dinner, but more for a quick bite or if you don't feel like cooking at home.

I'll stop by here if I'm in the area, but I've been to better Hawaiian places.
ps. They have a $15 minimum for card which is A LOT considering their meals are $6-8 on average, so carry cash."}
{"text":"I just lost my appetite. As soon as I open my order of the chicken katsu, all I can see is that nasty little black piece of hair stuck to the inside of the to go container. How do you not notice that when making the order? So disgusting! The food looked delicious, but I couldn't get over that wavy little black strand of hair. Just thinking of where it could've came from. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I was still in high school when this location opened. 

Come here regularly since it's right by my house and anytime I'm too lazy to make my own musubis I just stop by. 

Not going to lie a small piece of me dies everytime I fork over $2 for a musubi. 

But, they do a decent job of making plate lunches the way we would back home. So I guess I can't complain too much. I usually get the chicken katsu or the bbq chicken. The kalbi is good too. 

I have never tried their malasadas because I'm afraid I will be disappointed so... if let me know if you have tried it and if it's worth it. Oh, and if you're not from Hawaii I won't really think you have a valid opinion."}
{"text":"This is the first time in 8 years I have had Hawaiian food.  The layout of the restaurant is weird, you enter either the left or right side. If you enter the left,  you are seated, given a menu,  and served on plates.  You enter the right,  you order at the counter, and served in Styrofoam containers.  The cashier was nice,  perky, and friendly,  which is rare. 

There are tons of things to order from the menu,  which I'm more than sure,  Chef Gordon Ramsay would hate! I had the Loco Moco, which is 2 ground beef patties with gravy on top, served over a big ass bed of white rice.  And to top it off they serve you 2 fried eggs on top! It was all delicious, they also give you a side of macaroni salad, it was okay,  just needed some salt.  

My cousin had the combo with chicken katsu, fried slices of chicken,  not greasy,  very good especially the teriyaki sauce! And he also had short spare ribs,  also very tasty but it looked like carne asada, nice and tender. We also ordered the spam matsu, looks like an sushi roll, but stuffed with rice and spam! All delicious, next time I'll try the meat combo or wonton soup.  They do have a Chinese menu here! And everything is affordable!"}
{"text":"Continuously a great place to have a meal in Vegas. Thank you for the continued service and fresh quality food."}
{"text":"Asian/Hawaiian Caf√© style diner. D√©cor is simple fast casual. The food was really tasty. The combo is enough for two to share. In fact, most entrees are so large two people can share. The chow fun was really surprisingly good. The wonton egg noodle soup is my fav here. Reminds me of home cook meals. The people here are friendly. I will definitely be back to try other entrees."}
{"text":"Excellent food, huge portions, and a real Hawaiian feel.  I had the Broccoli w Chicken and the Chicken Katsu Curry.  Both were delicious!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Hawaii several times and one of my favorite things about the trips (other then just being in Hawaii!) is always the lunch plates. This restaurant has come the closest to the flavor I remember on my vacations and is very good. I only have had their combo plate with the chicken, spare ribs and BBQ pork - of course it also comes with white rice and macaroni salad. The one plate was enough for two people, typical mainland American serving size (AKA, way too much for one person), but I'm not complaining! Just gives me lunch for two days! Great place!
Additional note - I saw the person who reviewed before me said the chicken was a bit dry but I did not have this. I was actually surprised how flavorful and juicy the chicken was. Maybe hit or miss on the chicken? The BBQ beef was awesome though, I do agree with that!"}
{"text":"This Hawaiian BBQ place is awesome and amazing! !!! The salmon and rice is delicious and the hamburgers are amazing! !!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat if you're looking for local food. Prices are very reasonable and portions are huge, like it use to be in Hawaii. Hamburger steak taste like its made from scratch and not just store bought.  Gravy could use some \"love\" but it is expected. Noodle soup was a lot and wife could not finish it. A must stop if you want local food away from home and California Hotel. Customer service is awesome. Friendly, inviting, helpful.  Make the food taste even better. 
Food 4 stars 
Customer service  5 stars"}
{"text":"Fast dependable service. It's your typical Hawaiian flavored foods. Very consistent with taste and portions. Every time it's satisfying. Try the garlic shrimp! Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Been here before and it was decent a year or two ago, things definitely went downhill.  

Called in an order for pick up as it's cold/windy/rainy outside and just wanted some good eats at home.  Ordered a Chicken Katsu/Kal Bi combo and their Salt/Pepper Pork Chop (they've got an extended Chinese menu added to their \"Hawaiian\" menu).

Finally got home and opened our plates to see HAIR right next to the Chicken Katsu.  I was not about to drive back, wait for another plate to get cooked, then drive back home to eat, (not to mention my other plate getting cold while I go out and do all of this) so I figured just call and they could credit my card back or give me another replacement plate another day.  

Their response:
1- come back on the same day and they will make me another plate
OR
2- come back another day for a 10% discount

REALLY?  
If I don't want to drive back the same day for YOUR mistake ALL you're going to do for me and my plate of food with HAIR is to give me a 10% discount on whatever I decide to spend more of my money on for an additional plate?  So I lose my money on my first plate for apparent reasons, then I CAN spend another $8-$9 minus 10%??  Horrible customer service and bad judgement on managements part.

P.S.
I tried their \"Salt and Pepper Pork Chops\" and they should more accurately call it Salt and Pepper Batter Balls with slivers of pork and bones.  There were about 3 pieces that tasted like actual pork chops and the rest of it were balls of deep fried batter with little bitty bones.  I've had this dish at numerous chinese restaurants around Las Vegas like Joyful House who nail it, sadly Ohana missed the mark on this dish.  I'd hate to taste their General Tso's chicken/Orange chicken dishes with the same batter balls and bitty pieces of meat...never on my penny.

Needless to say they can take that 10% discount (what a joke for having HAIR in their dish) and give it to someone else, I'm never going back.

Go to L&L Barbeque, Island Sushi, Rice Trax, or Island Flavor for good Hawaiian Style plate lunches.  If you want chinese go someplace in Chinatown (Asian BBQ & Noodles, Joyful House), Hawaiian Chinese style at Diamond China or Wo Fat. 

Save your money and stay away from this place, too many good options out there for you with better service and better food."}
{"text":"Everything we had was so good! Loco Moco, beef chow fun and spam fried rice were all delicious. Icing on the cake was the fresh malasadas. They were still piping hot. We had to have some right then and there."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Hawaiian BBQ place in Vegas. They have delicious food that you can't get enough! I've tried a few other Hawaiian places and they never compared to this one. 
My go to meal is the combo with BBQ chicken and Chicke Katsu with all macaroni salad. It's a huge portion which is very filling, a lot of the time I have left over to either dinner or lunch. Let me tell you, this delicious food also makes pretty good left overs. 
The staff is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Rude!! Called today to place a catering order. Asked if delivery was available today. 
Guy responds \"uh, uh, um no. Catering with delivery requires at least two days advance notice.\" 
Me: \"ok no problem, can I place the order for pick up by noon?\"
Guy:\"uh, Ugh,uh  I guess.. for how much?\"

No need! I'll call and place and order with any other place similar to yours with the expectation they will have what you lack! (Didn't actually say this to Ride Guy)

 Customer service is obviously a value at Ohana Hawaii. Fortunately, L&L on Mowry was polite and happened to be slightly cheaper for the same food."}
{"text":"Food was oh so ono! Inside is nice and clean..the food is better than L&L for sure. Cannot really see the location from the street, recommend a bigger sign on both sides of the main streets(Warm Spring & Eastern)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the staff has always been friendly and the food is fantastic. I always order the saimin and a spam musubi. We arrived yesterday at around 4:06p (not too busy to warrant a very long wait). We stopped by on our way home for a take-out order. They took our order pretty quickly and we waited at the table for it to be done. It was taking a little bit longer so I waited in the car since I wasn't feeling well. Several minutes later my husband came out to confirm my order because they didn't know what I ordered. A little while after no sign of him so I went inside. Still no order and he was looking annoyed. I asked the girl at the counter how much longer and she said 5 min. Not a big deal but 25 min had already passed so it was upsetting. I asked to cancel it cause I was so upset but my husband was hungry so we changed our mind. The food was ready a couple minutes later and I let him pick it up since I was so upset. She offered us a drink for the inconvenience but I feel that a drink was not enough for the 35 min wait. We only ordered a combo plate, one spam musubi and a chicken saimin. 3 items in our order should not have taken THAT long. The time on our order was 4:06p and we left at 4:40p. I'd like to be contacted by the manager of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great staff and great flavored food. Only complaint was the spare ribs were over cooked today. Doesn't mean they are always, every day and meal I'm sure is different. Honestly it's hard to find spare ribs not cooked to long it's actually pretty Normal."}
{"text":"Food is good but to get it takes some time to get it. I called in my order to pick up and still wasn't ready after the quoted 10 minutes. It's food to go for a reason right? Not get there then wait another 15 minutes for my order...let alone the person in line before me will get their food in 10 minutes. Waiting for 30 minutes to get a mini BBQ chicken is too long.

I understand it gets busy but if you're backed up on orders don't tell me when I get there. Bad time management, communication and overall slow cashier. 

3 stars for the food and location...probably won't be back though. Go to Island Flavor, it's right down the street."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food I've tested  Near where I love.

Love this place, Combo plate is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Better than L&L, nowhere near as good as Dakine's or Keilani's."}
{"text":"This is the Hawaiian BBQ in town.  I go here on a regular basis and the food is always good.  Portion sizes are pretty big."}
{"text":"This is the third location of Ohana I've tried and it is much better than the others.They must have different cooks. One of my favorites is the Hawaiaan BBQ beef saimin. It's so simple but the meat is full of flavor and super tender. It's perfect on a cold day. I usually order a side of kimchi to go with it. Their kimchi has a little sweetness and just enough heat. If youre going to try Ohana this is the one to go to."}
{"text":"I come here very often with my friends and family, and I must say that this is probably the most delicious Hawaiian food I've had in Vegas. It's relatively close to my house so I like the location. My all time favorite is the BBQ mix and Katsu Chicken. I definintly reccommend this place if you're looking to dine Hawaiian."}
{"text":"i only get the chicken katsu here or the chicken katsu curry.  Ohana is one of the few places that uses chicken breasts instead of thighs for their katsu which is great.  ive tried the hawaiian bbq beef which was a little chewy and the garlic shrimp was a tad oily.  i cannot complain about the chicken katsu curry. 

However the curry is like a thai curry."}
{"text":"Glad I stopped by this Hawaiian bbq before heading home! When you step in, it has a separation to the restaurant for more seating. Decor is fresh and clean. 

Food:
I had the mini garlic shrimp where I was asked if I wanted my shrimp peeled or not, nice option to let me know. Shrimp was fresh and meaty. The Mac salad was actually good and not too much mayo. I loved everything about this place! Back home, Hawaiian food is super greasy and no quality in their meats... 


If you're hungry, head over here!!"}
{"text":"This place is great and fast better than some L&L locations and the food tasted very fresh not preheated or anything like that.

I recommend getting the bbq and seafood mix combo. We got Chicken katsu as a mini plate and it was nice and crunchy and tender on the inside. They also have a Chinese menu too for the greasy craves. I love Hawaiian food and this place satisfied my appetite."}
{"text":"Delicious, from the Chinese food options like Chicken fried rice to the bbq beef plates. Haven't ordered one thing that I didn't end up LOVING. Portions are generous and prices are good. Always a happy customer."}
{"text":"Second time trying this place.  :)

Is it the best Hawaiian place I've tried in Vegas?  No. Is it better then L&L which is also close to where I live?  Yes! :)

It's like your normal Hawaiian place.  Nicely decorated and staff is always on par.  Food is decent....like I said above....not the best....but decent and most importantly close to where I live.  :)

I've tried the Loco moco and one of their meat combos. All decent.  

Will I be coming back?  Yup! Why cuz my favorite Hawaiian place is just too far sometimes and I need my Hawaiian fix NOW! lol :)"}
{"text":"they got now cake noodles very good!  If your from Hawaii you wont be dissapointed. Try the fried won ton strips ... not greasy."}
{"text":"The chicken Katsu was delicious and the rice was also delicious too The people there were nice and it is a good place to relax and grab a Pepsi this place deserves a commercial you should try it"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great selection and even better, reasonable prices! They package everything as take-out, so no need to have to worry about asking for a box to go. I can't wait to try other things on their menu, even though I am a sucker for the crab rangoon. I thought only Chinese places had that? frankly, I don't care. 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! We always order chicken katsu when we go, and even if it is pretty simple food, it always tastes so great! Even my extremely picky-eater son loves this place, and even asks to eat the \"crispy chicken\" from here. We also ordered a tray of their katsu for my son's first birthday a while back and their katsu stayed crunchy and fresh tasting, albeit it sitting out for a while. Their bbq plates are always, also, so tasty, and so is their macaroni salad... And I don't even like macaroni salad! Service is great, and the elderly lady at the register (who I'm assuming is also the owner?) is always so sweet and welcoming. Knockin of one star cause their thai iced tea wasn't that great, but everything else we've tried so far were excellent! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Staff is very very nice and food is great. Come and check the new extended side of the restaurant. They have soup and much more."}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaiian bbq in Las Vegas.  They make everything from scratch.  The servings are enormous.  It's challenging to finish your entree.  Also if you like spam - this is your go to place.  I'm not big on spam but I love everything I have tried there.

The staff are amazingly nice and helpful.  The locals know about this spot and it's usually busy.  But a lot of people get stuff to go. 

If you are in the mood for some Hawaiian food swing by and try it out."}
{"text":"Great food. Really !  The wife loves it and we will go back for more great cooking. The crispy chicken wings are some of the biggest I've seen or tasted. Great crust and very tasty."}
{"text":"Very yummy food. If never been order the shrimp with rice or pineapple chicken with rice way good 2nd time going and I've been to Hawaii a few times and ate at the shrimp shacks and it's very close... Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"yeah, . . . no.

I've grown to expect a certain level of awesome when it comes to Hawaiian eats in Vegas, which shouldn't really be too unheard of, especially when considering how many folks from Hawaii actually reside here
(Vegas is officially Hawaii's ninth island for goodness sake).

And don't get me wrong, Vegas does have some amazing Hawaiian eateries.
Ohana just doesn't happen to be one of them.

Was it because it is a chain place?
No, for whatever reason, I'm a little more forgiving about that kinda stuff out here.
*Not to say Vegas lacks originality or anything but this town is home to a mini Statue of Liberty, Tour Eiffel, and one pyramid of Giza (complete with Sphinx).

What was really disappointing (besides the food obviously) is the fact it is regarded so highly on Yelp and received some really super positive reviews.

Chicken katsu, pork lau lau, bbq chicken, and garlic shrimp.  meh, okay, meh, and meh.
Oh well, I guess you can't always have a winning hand.

Aloha Ohana."}
{"text":"Brought the Mr here because its sooo convenient for us that one likes ramen and the other likes Hawaiian food hehehe. Im glad this place exist because they have a friendly crew, fast and relaxing eating area for a pretty reasonable price, nothing too fancy but a local joint and great food!"}
{"text":"i love how the owner of this location has step up their dining services, they are also the owners of the Blue Diamond/Decatur location which makes them even more fantastic! We are/were not fans of the regular Ohana BBQ locations out here but these newer locations definitely won us over. We have been to both locations with very great services. 
You have 2 options which is funny and cool at the same time. . . so your entrance will be 1st Ohana BBQ which then gives you the option to eat there which is like any other fast food sit in but with more comfortable seating and you get a charging station at your table which is sooo awesome because you can charge your phone, laptops etc. . . so if you dont want to sit there then theres your 2nd option which is pretty cool too and is another room next door with different menu like chinese and more restaurant feel and you get a waitress and all that good stuffs. what makes it great is that say you want to try the restaurant option you may still order from the Hawaiian selections and that means your group or partner doesn't have to be split and can enjoy a meal together."}
{"text":"Def 1 of my most fav noodle spots. Personal fav is the won ton noodle soup with the crispy gau gee! Price are good, quality and portions are good as well! Big parking lot so never have to look far to find parking. Service is always good here, all the staff are super friendly. Def a spot to check out when on this side of town."}
{"text":"Delicious!
Staff was very friendly, made great suggestions. 
They seemed to know everyone that walked in. 
I had the pork steam buns which were very tender.
So many choices!  That might be the only negative."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible service, say at the counter for a few minutes while the cashier was on her cell phone ignoring us. Once we finally got her to get off the phone we place our order and she informed us their ice machine didn't work. We waited for our order while it sat on a tray but she was too busy on her cell phone again to bring it to us. We finally grabbed it ourselves. I would recommend never going to this ohana, the one on blue diamond is way better as far as service goes."}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened nearby! I believe these are franchises as not all Ohana BBQs are created equal. We always order take-out from the Blue Diamond location and this one seems to have the same owner/menu.

The restaurant is clean, modern and they have phone outlet chargers throughout (which is a cool touch).

My favorite menu items include the cake noodles, stir fried udon, hamburger steak and Korean pork belly buns. 

The saimin is your typical saimin, although I wish it had a little more spam (comes with 1 piece, cut into 4 strips).

They have a large menu and overall the flavor/quality is good, compared to other quick casual Hawaiian restaurants. We will definitely be frequenting this new location!"}
{"text":"We ate here on the 2nd after driving around hungry and indecisive. I pulled out my handy-dandy Yelp app and searched for what was nearby. Our little blue navigating arrow showed we were headed straight for it, so we figured, why not?

I ordered the BBQ mix - you get chicken, one slice of kalbi ribs and bulgogi style meat. It also comes with rice and mac salad. I always forget to ask for no mac, as I usually don't like them - but this time it turned out ok. I actually at the whole serving!
 The chicken was good, juicy and full of flavor. The Kalbi was ok. It was what I expected from a Hawaiian joint (I prefer traditional Korean) - I would eat it again, but I doubt I would ever crave it from here. The bulgogi style meat was dry and a little bland. Even Chris wouldn't eat it (and bulgogi is one of his favorites!). 

Chris ordered the chicken katsu plate. It was a big serving and must have been decent, because he ate the whole thing! Oh, and the Katsu plate is the special 3 days a week!

The atmosphere is nothing special, but is definitely comfortable. 

The total bill for us with our 2 dinners and 2 small drinks came to $19.13, which isn't horrible, but definitely isn't the cheapest out there, either. 

It's not a new favorite place or anything, but the quantity and quality was decent. I think I might just stick to the chicken and kalbi ribs and skip the other beef. We both agree that it's not off our list, but isn't really a strong top contender, either."}
{"text":"I came here because of their location near the golf course. I ended up trying the beef, chicken and short rib combo. In spite of being a unplanned visit, I was very pleased with the flavor, quantity and quality. The meats had a great flame grilled flavor and their sauces were flavorful without being too sweet. It might be one of the best Hawaiian BBQ places in Las Vegas, I took 2 home for the family and they agreed."}
{"text":"Best Katsu Ive tasted in Vegas and the bbq chicken plate is fat boy goals frfr. Have loved this place for years now. Cheat meal days are at Ohanas lol. The burger and fries are good here also 

 Dont forget the extra katsu sauce.

{"text":"There are over a hundred reviews for Ohana Hawaiian BBQ. One more positive review will not change the other positive reviews, so I'll just keep it short and sweet.

***** Seafood/BBQ combo
****   Loco Moco
****   Thai Milk Tea with Boba
***    Chicken Katsu

Of note: Look for a license plate sticker that says \"Paradise\" on the kitchen side entrance.

It's true. This is a gem of an island food in the desert."}
{"text":"Their new additional section has many delicious dishes I love. I love the pork noodle soup with boiled egg which is cooked just right. The soup base is incredible. 
I also enjoy the buns with grilled pork belly slice.
This will be my favorite noodle place here."}
{"text":"Ohana is located in one of many many MANY strip malls in Vegas. A good stop for a quick bite to eat, or to take something to go.

Had the Chicken Katsu and the Mixed BBQ dish (which includes a bit of Short Ribs, BBQ Beef, and BBQ chicken). Both dishes came with mac salad and rice. Both were REALLY solid dishes and the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. I think two people could have been decently full off of one dish. 

At decent prices, fast service, ginormous portions, and great food, why wouldn't I come here again? Definitely would like to try their thai iced tea or boba next time."}
{"text":"Overall, I don't really have any complaints here. I always get fast and friendly service and you seem to get a lot of food for your money here. For example, I have to get the mini Chicken Katsu because the regular size one is way too much food. It's great if you don't mind taking leftovers home. I can't really comment on the authenticity of the Hawaiian-ness of the food but it tastes like any other \"Hawaiian\" joint."}
{"text":"Wow! Went here for the first time last night. We ordered the BBQ plate and the Katsu Chicken plate. Both were outstanding. The BBQed meats were done perfectly, the Katsu Chicken was super crunchy, but not greasy. The macaroni salad was perfectly chilled. This is the best Hawaiian food I've had in Vegas. L&L is okay, but cannot compare to Ohana."}
{"text":"My favorite Hawaiian restaurant  love the garlic shrimp, fast service & friendly staff always clean."}
{"text":"I had the chicken katsu saimin.  The flavor was decent and the value was spot on but the chicken was as tough as, well, I don't have an adequate description regarding the texture of the chicken.  Not tender.  I had to ask for a knife to cut it.  The flavor of the broth was good.  My dining partners had loco moco (he described it as 7/10), and a chicken chow fun (8/10).  Service was a bit uneven.  Our three dinners were served to us at three separate times.  Can't blame the servers, they didn't want to food to cool down while the other orders were still waiting."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Hawaiian place I've been to so far around here. There are just too many awesome things to order off the menu here-can't possibly eat all of it. I did manage to get through a seafood combo which came with fried shrimp, fish and terriyaki beef for less than nine bucks-not too shabby. It of course came with the standard mayonnaise macaroni and plenty of rice- best part of eating Hawaiian is never leaving hungry. I also had the Thai iced tea which was delicious and even had the boba balls which I haven't had in years since coming to Vegas, but I'm told the milk tea is even better. My only complaint of the night was getting run out at 9:45 pm-I cannot emphasize how crucial the \"late night\" selling point is for Vegas, yeah you could play poker at an Indian place in CA, but can you have spam musubi at the same time?"}
{"text":"Stopped by to give this place a 2nd chance.  Both times food was horrible.  Slimy general chicken that was rock hard and super salty veggie mix.  Won't be back!  Stick to Island Flavor instead.  There more accommodating with orders.  I have never complained but literally I found the food to be inedible.  When I called to let them know they didn't care."}
{"text":"I have found my new Hawaiian place to grub at, and it's only a 30 second drive, woo-hoo!

I was madly craving some spam musubi, so I pulled up my handy dandy yelp app and this place happened to pop up first. The only problem is that it was already 10 after 9 and they were closing in 20 minutes, I decided to give them a call anyways and asked if I could place an order, to my surprise, the cashier said yes. 

Most places turn you down so I was extremely happy. I ended up ordering the loco moco with a spam musubi on the side. I got to the restaurant and there were about 5 people waiting to get their food, so that's a good sign, still busy late night. The cashier was really friendly and I got my food very quick.

The loco moco was amazing! The gravy wasn't as salty as other places I've been to, and the macaroni wasn't overpowered with mayonnaise, phew! The spam musubi on the other hand, could have used a bit more sauce, it was a bit too dry for my liking. Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"This is the best Hawaiian food I've had in a LONG time! Absolutely delicious & very speedy delivery! They said it would take 45 mins but they showed up way earlier than that. The food was hot and had a great flavor."}
{"text":"Great BBQ food, always fresh when served and its way better than L&L..."}
{"text":"Came here because I read on their menu they have Chicken Katsu Curry. I wanted to try this as I read reviews that this item was good. I'm visiting from Jersey and we don't have many Hawaiian restaurants, so I was very excited to come here. I placed my order with Melodee who repeated the order back to me THREE times and each time she stated \"Chicken Katsu Curry\" and when she handed my order to me (as I placed my order to go) she repeated it again... \"Chicken Katsu Curry\". Therefore, I was pretty confident that my order was accurate when I left as Melodee repeated it back correctly several times. However, when I arrived home and opened the container I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND ANNOYED that there was NO curry. She gave me the regular Katsu sauce! Thanks for ruining my dinner Melodee and my impression about your business. Melodee, why bother repeating orders if you're only going to give your customers the wrong items?!?"}
{"text":"I can't believe it's been quite some time since I came in. I normally don't crave Hawaiian food but when I do I come here. The food is always on point and always leaves me satisfied. Their portions are also large and you can save some for leftovers. Aside from the good food is great service. The one woman who helped us today definitely deserves recognition. Thanks for the good eats and service. I will definitely be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Can't beat the food for the price. Brought back memories from the Hawaiian island.  I got the katsi curry chicken.  Very crispy and curry sauce was very very tasty.  I got the regular size and it was big enough to share between 2 people. My sister got the pork lau lau. Flavor was very good brother got a Siam with Hawaiian beef.  Definitely going back again.  Food was amazing for the price."}
{"text":"Again this never disappoints me at all, every L&L is never like this one THIS IS THE BEST L&L in LAS VEGAS HANDS DOWN! Every other L&L never have such a friendly staff like this one they are always respectful always getting my order right not like other L&L's there always fast at making the food even when it looks busy inside the place. They have a great team here and I hope one day I have a team like this when I eventually open my business. Thank you again, 5 Stars"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have been eating here regularly since I discovered it a year and a half ago, and I usually get the BBQ Mix Plate because I can not decide on which meat to order(they are all that awesome). The only complaint is that it is horrible for my diet! I used to think that L&L was the only place for Hawaiian, but they can not compare. This is not only the best Hawaiian food I have ever eaten, but the best take out I have ever had! Give it a shot, if you don't like it you're only out about $8.00. I am pretty sure you'll love it though."}
{"text":"You have to eat here. Don't wait just go. 

The portions are huge so you might want to share with 2-3 people or you can have enough for another meal later. 

Everything we ate was tasty, fresh, and mouthwatering. My favorite was the grilled chicken. It was so tender and moist. I highly recommend you get it!

The drinks were all exceptional. My favorite was the Thai tea but the milk tea was also good as well as the passion fruit tea. Get all of them!

Last but not least the service was phenomenal. Our waitress rocked it. 

Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorites are the garlic noodles with shrimp and the katsu plate.  In addition, their prices are reasonable and food is always delicious."}
{"text":"The Skinny: the food - not with a ten foot pole! (1), the service is crap (0).

Craving some Hawaiian BBQ after coming back from Hawaii, my hubby insisted on coming here for a taste Hawaii. 

I tried the Kalua pork and my husband had the curry chicken katsu.

Although the portion sizes are enormous, I can't overlook the fact that the food isn't that great. Just the smell of the Kalua pork was off putting - something about it made me nauseated. The flavour was of over-seasoned canned meat. The watery - yes, watery! texture of the pork is an insult to the whole concept of salted roasted pork.

The chicken katsu curry was also watery and rather bland. 

Given other great Hawaiian places so close by, it's hard to justify coming here. 

FInally, FYI bring your own water if you do decide to try this place.

When I asked for a glass of tap water, the cashier woman said the only water available was the bottled water. Then she proceeded to hand a plastic cup filled with watered down Thai iced tea to my hubby.

I'm not stupid. You have plastic cups, you can fill it with tap water. 'Nuff said.

For that reason, this place gets a big fat one star - I would give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"This used to be part of my lunch rotation when I worked in the area, and it was always tasty.  Ordering ahead of time can save yourself a LOT of trouble as this place gets packed during then.  Like, line out the door packed.

Fairly small inside, so if you want to order and dine-in, be prepared to get comfortable with your companions.  There are also not a lot of seats, so I'd avoid coming here with a large group unless you're OK with sitting at different tables.  If that happens, just enjoy the HUGE picture they have of Waikiki Beach on the wall.  =D

I usually get the curry katsu chicken because I'm kind of obsessed with it.  The small plate is more than enough for me, and it's around $6 or $7 which isn't terrible.  Their macaroni salad is slammin', yo.  Mmm.  Thai tea here is good, not too sweet like it can be.  OK selection of the Hawaiian Sun products, wish there was a bit more though.

Spam musubi is good, too!  But if a Hawaiian place screwed up Spam musubi, seppuku should be imminent."}
{"text":"I used to go to their other location off 215 and Durango when I worked on that side of town, but since I switched jobs (thankfully) I have discovered and tried out this closer-to-my-home location.

Every time I've been here I've ordered the chicken katsu curry mini-sized to go and it tastes just as good as their other location!

Staff is very friendly here and even when you order 20 minutes before close, they are still happy to assist (I know, I know - that was my bad).

Very clean and quick, and never a hassle.  Mahalo!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I really like their food, I always get the chicken katsu.. its delicious!.. their regular serving sizes are pretty big so I tend to order the 'mini' size if I am just ordering for myself."}

{"text":"We typically go to the Ohana Bbq on Eastern. It's been years since we went to this location. Since then they have renovated and there is now a Noodle menu and extra seating. I'm pretty consistent when ordering I know what I like so I tend to go on the safe side to make sure I don't end up disappointed. 

Ordered my combination pan fried noodles, the kids got their chicken katsu and some manapua's. I don't know if they use different ingredients or if it's the cooks but everything tastes off and honesty I would give 2 stars for the food but since I have had better experiences I know that they are capable of making decent food I'll give them 3 stars. 

The noodles just didn't taste right the sauce seemed extra watery with no flavor. The katsu was soggy not crispy and the gravy was overly salty. Nothing amazing about their service but it wasn't bad. They asked if our table was clean enough and if we wanted them to clean it again. The place was dirty food all over the floor but then again it was about a hour before closing so I'm sure they had a dinner rush. Not the best experience I've had at Ohana Bbq I'll be sure to stick to the Eastern Location."}
{"text":"The fact that this location offers more then the regular menu has made it so much more convenient for your random cravings. The portions are great and the prices are average. 

The service is usually consistent quick friendly nothing more nothing less. For the first time I ordered pick up I was told 25 mins. Which then became another 20 mins. It's hit I have 3 kids sitting in a car waiting for a meal. I know it's normal to run behind but when your more on the fast food atmosphere 45 mins for 2 orders is just un real.  The food is well worth it but I was very disappointment with the wait."}
{"text":"I would normally give them 10 stars if I could, but today is the first time I walked in and the girl behind the counter was rude, condescending, and very unfriendly.  I eat here so much that the other cashiers know me. It's unfortunate that one bad day can ruin my experience here."}
{"text":"I like catering from this place for big gatherings. We usually order a pan of mixed meat and macaroni salad. Garlic noodles and spam musubi are always everyone's favorite."}
{"text":"Love this place. By far the best Hawaiian chicken!  The salmon plate is really good too. Always fast and friendly. They have really good tea too."}
{"text":"For a \"fast food\" hawaiian bbq place, Ohana satisfies my craving for plate lunches (especially when Island Flavor is closed). They have your usual plate lunches of teriyaki chicken, chicken katsu, mix plates of beef, galbi, and chicken and other plates of seafood. I think that their chicken is actually the best thing on the menu as it is extremely juicy and flavorful. The recently had the beef mixed plate and it was ok, but I think I will be sticking to the chicken. You also get 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of mac salad (if you order the regular portion) and you can also substitute veggies (for an additional charge of $0.50). Good place to grab a fairly large meal for under $10 when you are craving some hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Sit down restaurant quality food at fast food prices. It's not fast food, it's great food fast. Every dish they make is excellent, weather it's Hawaiian or Asian. I go back all the time! We sometimes get delivery if we get stuck at the office."}
{"text":"We ate at the blue diamond store for 4+ years. Always awesome. Ordered pick up from this store since we moved to Henderson. The combo pan fried meal was very short of meat. I have never been disappointed in your food. The taste was par. Veggies awesome. We will give them another shot soon. I hope for a better meal."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and this place is awesome!  I liked the food in Hawaii when we visited, but I thought L&L was nasty.  Cold chicken, macaroni salad that left a tinny taste in my mouth, etc.  However, Ohana was AWESOME!  The Kahuna pork is simply amazing.  It was a good suggesting from Mahina, the hostess.  The fish is good here too!  The cooks Carlos and Freddy really know what they are doing.  I was so impressed with the place that I asked everyone's name, so I could give them props here.  Not sure what else I can do, but tell you to go and enjoy!  4 locations in Vegas, family owned.  Yum."}
{"text":"I have been driving to the location on blue diamond.  Didn't realize this location opened much closer to me.  I appreciate the nice interiors of this restaurant.  Very open space.  

I was tempted to go to Taste restaurant next door but felt more in the mood for casual. 

I went for the Chinese menu.  I know it is Hawaiian food here but I actually prefer this over the other casual Chinese options.   Salt and pepper shrimp!  Yumm!   And just around $10 comes with rice.  Really hit the spot.  Will frequent this restaurant often.  

Next time I'll go for the Hawaiian menu.  The other Hawaiian option closer to home is terrible.  I'm sure I'll like this place more."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place a lot but the quality has gone done over the past 6 months.  I like to order the Spam Saiman since they would give you an entire slice of Spam.  Last 3 times I've gone there you only get 4 tiny slices of Spam (less than half what you used to get). Didn't think Spam so expensive that a restaurant would have to cut back in order to increase the profit margin.  Oh well....guess it's L&L for me now."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss this place!!! We use to live across the street and ate Here almost everyday. Now a year later just to visit we get our favorite Curry Katsura bowl . The cashiers here are always friendly and inviting. Good food made to order and the portions are generous. This is probably the one thing I miss living in Henderson ."}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as not enough local food in Vegas? Not. I have always notice the Ohana Hawaiian BBQ restaurants but from another location just as close to home. Once I saw they open another location add that to the bookmark. 

The food was awesome. Chicken Katsu really the only thing get for the most part or my favorite. I like about the Ohana Hawaiian BBQ style is the chicken pounded out thin, really nice even coating of panko, and perfect golden brown color crust. The katsu sauce admit tend like other local spots but it still solid and enjoy it. I feel like it not as thick as other spots. The portion size is HUGE. The amount of chicken get for regular is more like two meals for the price of one. I rarely eat the whole portion unless starving. The menu enjoy they had more diversity then the other location.  They have whole section of boba drinks on the menu. I never ordered one but saw someone else and it looked good. Might have try some next visit. I like menu interactive type with pictures and rolls over showing more menu items. Different. 

Really the best thing about this location compare to other one been to off Durango. I believe they have couple more locations (never been). This location is got brand new vibe, new building, and great spot to chill while having some local food. They have lot more seating then the other location. They have lot of booths, and tables. The high ceiling, very open feel, and the decor ESPECIALLY with the huge spam logo  plus the 808. Local style on point! They have two huge wide screens on both side right in the middle. I just happen to go for lunch during playoff action. It felt like chilling at home all relax with local food and football. The staff is five stars for sure. They were friendly, attentive, and brought out food with smile and positive vibes."}
{"text":"Very yummy food, fast and friendly service ....
I really love the Manapua's !!
I recommend this place for sure !"}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price. Their chicken is on point and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Man this place was delicious!

It's the same as LL Hawaiian for those who know what that is. 

I had the bbq chicken and it was really good. Plus their Mac salad was better than LL 

Which we had one in Austin."}
{"text":"Great local food and serving local sized portions. Had the Loco Moco, the Seafood mix, some Malisadas and Portuguese sausage Misubis...Ono stuff. Everything was hot and fresh, even the Malasadas at 1430 in the afternoon! very fair pricing for the portions...5 $ for ten Malasadas! Will be back every visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Rare beef steak soup aka Pho
- it was OK, best pho in the area but there's better in Chinatown
- lots of meat was included

Mini chicken plate 
- GET IT!

Service was great, my water was constantly filled. The place was very clean.

There are two sides to this place a sit down and order from the menu side and an order first. There's so much food on the menu, from Chinese to Hawaiian to Vietnamese. I still want to go back and try more. Their menu you is tremendous!"}
{"text":"Hello, hope this seems fair, I have to give this place 3 stars. I've ordered here about 5 times. These are my opinions.
   The inside is very clean & service is good. I did have issues on separate occasions with quality, taste & packaging. 
   They quality of their Lau Lau was bad the first time, then I tried once more hoping it would taste better, but it wasn't :( 
   The taste of most of their food is good but nothing that really wows you, kind of basic but not in a bad way. One time we ordered food for home & didn't get our sauces for katsu & extra sauces we.requested on the side. It was really disappointing that we didn't have the sauces because it did need it to boost the flavors and we'll, pretty mandatory for certain dishes. 
   I was border line on giving 4 stars but when you have a dish on the menu that really tastes bad, most likely frozen store bought, you lose a lot of credibility for being a restaurant. Even if it is a faster pace type of dining, there's plenty of down time to have your cooks create recipes from scratch. If there is no down time, then your business is doing well and you can hire an extra cook to assist with making fresh quality dishes. I don't see any room for excuses on this subject
    Hope this rating was fair and I do intend on eating here again in a couple weeks. Id like to try more dishes to give this place more opportunities for an extra star or maybe 2 :)"}
{"text":"It been while since the last time came here for plate lunch action. Since L&L opened up been more partial too going there for my local kind plate lunch. Not that I have any problem with Ohana and still don't because they still do great job! Tonight felt like mixing it up change something I try too do with food. I ordered one of my favorite plate lunch chicken katsu. Good. The difference between L&L and Ohana the chicken katsu. Ohana it lot less greasy, same token some reason felt like chicken was dried out not as moist as normal, and the mac salad L&L is way better. But in all still love my local food Ohana is place that would go back too or mix things up once in while.."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. The katsu was tasty and the portion was pretty big for a \"mini\". It came with a scoop of rice and mac salad. I brought a good amount back home (dinner)! Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I chose this place after looking up random places near my training location. I ordered the regular portioned Loco Moco which came with two patties, 2 eggs over easy (at my request), rice, and some pasta salad. I wish I had paid more attention to how much food came with the Mini vs the regular portion cause I should've ordered the mini. It was all delicious, but very difficult for me to finish. The Mini is half the serving of the regular so unless you can eat a lot or plan to bring it home to eat it later, the Mini will probably be just fine for you. The only thing I really had an issue was the salt they added to the eggs even with the abundance of gravy on this dish itself. I could've done without that, but otherwise the experience itself was great."}
{"text":"Stopped by on 08/22/14 for a quick dinner on the way to Wet N Wild. Ordered a BBQ mix plate, boba milk tea and thai tea w/ boba. The teas were good but the boba was super mushy. However, for $2.50-3.00 can you really complain?

The food was really similar to an L&L in regards to taste and price. The BBQ mix plate comes with a couple pieces of chicken, a handful of sliced beef and a strip of kalbi. The macaroni salad was a little bland and just ok. The meats were well seasoned and overall tasty; I just wished there was more than just a single strip of kalbi!

Not sure if the food is worth driving down here for since it's similar to L&L and any other Hawaiian joint that serves BBQ style food. I probably would come again for thai tea though the next time I'm on this side of town"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is that the food is amazing. Other than that the service there is terrible. The cashier is extremely rude and if she messes up the order is blames it on you.  Also they gave my order to the wrong customer and yet again the cashier blamed it on me as If it was my fault."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had ordered kind of last minute before closing. The lady was very rude and yelled at him to shut the door on the way out. other than that their food was good."}
{"text":"Always the friendliest staff & amazing food. The pineapple rangoons are the best I've ever had & the Siamin is just what you want if you have an upset stomach. Very reasonably priced & made with care."}
{"text":"This was our first stop for food when we got to Las Vegas (coming from the east coast) and thought my fiance and I should give this a try, especially because there isn't Hawaiian food where we're from. We had absolutely no idea what to get because everything on the menu looked good (besides the fact that we were pretty hungry haha) - so the staff was super friendly and helped make some recommendations! 
We ended up trying the kalua pork and the seafood bbq mix plate and got additional order of the honey BBQ wings and everything was delicious!! 
We actually ended up coming here again (full circle) at the end of our trip before we left Vegas. The 2nd time we tried the Chicken BBQ Saimin noodle soup and the Chicken katsu curry and it was also delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place but it appears that the entire staff changed including the cooks. I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp because it's delicious. This time they battered and fried the shrimp with the shell still on. It totally defeats the purpose of battering the shrimp. You bite into it and your mouth is greeted by a shell. In order to eat the shrimp, you have to peel the shell an batter off. Makes no sense. I was told by the new manager Britney that it's always how its prepared. I dont believe it. I've ordered this dish before and it was never like this. Well ay least the shrimp on my Singapore noodles were peeled..."}
{"text":"The only Hawaiian bbq place in Vegas I will eat at, the one on Blue Diamond. I love the kimchi fried rice, eat it almost once a week minimum! Staff is great too!"}
{"text":"This place is your typical Hawaiian Plate Lunch restaurant.

It's my \"go-to\" place for what I consider some of the best Chicken Katsu in town.  I think it's my favorite because whenever I order it, its never burnt, undercooked or anything like that.  From what I can tell, it's breast meat but unlike other places that use the breast, the meat is NOT DRY but instead really moist and tasty!

The teriyaki beef is good as well.

I just wish they were open 24 hours... ;)"}
{"text":"Love the pineapple Rangoon! Super delicious! A Must Try! Usually Mac Salad has too much mayo at other hawaiian places, but at this new spot, its just right. Very delicious food! Also get Buy One Get One Boba If you check in! Heads up; Only Applies to Ohana Milk Tea or Thai Tea."}
{"text":"Great place. Wish the chicken had more flavor/taste but definitely coming back. The beef & ribs are yummy, mac salad so good. Musubi is a must (I prefer no sauce)."}
{"text":"Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is clearly the MVP for actually having the peel and eat garlic shrimp. L&L is a let down when it comes to that. Having to drive all the way out for the peel and eat shrimp is exhausting, but definitely worth the half an hour trip. If you prefer your shrimp to be peeled & covered entirely  in oily tempura, then L&L is your calling."}
{"text":"I walked in today for lunch, and normally I'm greeted with a hearty \"Hello!\" from the cashier, but today, there was no enthusiasm in the greeting. I almost felt like I was interrupting her free time, because she was sitting on a chair. 
The food, as always, was cooked fresh to order. I got the BBQ Mix plate, that consist of BBQ Chicken, Spare Rib, and BBQ Beef. I always get it with all rice, because I'm not a huge fan of the macaroni salad. She quoted me 10 minutes, which is pretty normal time for any dish. If this had not been a last minute idea, I would have called in my order. 
All in all, food good, service, meh. If there was another option that was close, I'd go there, but until we get an L&L Hawaiian BBQ by work, Ohana will have to suffice."}
{"text":"I'm so obsessed with this place. I happen to work right next to this Ohana (dangerous!!) & I've been steadily gaining weight. I try to stay away but once I think of the bbq chicken or loco moco or even curry katsu my mouth starts watering. The girls are always so sweet too!"}
{"text":"My son loves their chicken katsu, and I love their garlic shrimp.  Friendly staff, accessible location.  Malasadas are good but pricey.  2 stars deducted for other food not being as good."}
{"text":"Good Hawaiian style food. Chicken Katsu and Spam Musubi always great!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food I've had in Las Vegas so far. We ordered the double cheeseburger meal and a mixed plate with chicken katsu and kahlua pig substituting the mac salad for the rice and they were all tasty. Well seasoned and super big portion with reasonable prices. Only scored it 4 stars because the sauce wasn't what I was expecting. The sauce seemed more of the katsu sauce I'd get at a Japanese restaurant instead of the ketchup/BBQ sauce I normally get at Hawaiian restaurants. The customer service was also excellent."}
{"text":"I have been eating Hawaiian food my whole life. My fianc√© and I were craving Hawaiian food and instead of driving to Hawaiian specialities at the Cal we decided to try this place out.  It was horrible!! We had the spicy poke, Saimin, spam musubi, and loco moco. 

First off the loco moco had a light brown gravy, normally it's dark brown.  Everyone knows that the gravy and the hamburger patty makes the loco moco. 

Second..the poke had an overwhelming amount of onions and was drenched in a mayo sauce. Probably the worst poke I've had.

The spam musubi and saimin was average, nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Found this place accidentally so it would be nice to see more advertisements being new from Hawaii I would love to know more places that I can find comfort foods from. The food there really has been delish. We have been there 3 times in the last 2 weeks since discovreing them and its ono. The girls at the counter have tons of aloha. My only comment would be that the food is a bit pricey and the cleanliness should be kept up a little more. Over all we will continue to come here. Its a taste of home and we love it."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at Ohana many times at their Durango location.  Overall, the food is good.   I would recommend their chicken katsu plates and garlic shrimp noodles.  I tried something different and had their chicken pan fried noodles.  I was not impressed.

First, the whole meal was flooded in sauce, which made the normally crunchy noodles very soggy.  It was like eating saimin.  Next,  the whole top was covered with vegetables with little chicken.  Finally, the taste was bland.  I've definitely had better.

This one bad order won't stop me from returning but definitely stay away from the pan fried noodles and stick to the traditional Hawaiian plates."}
{"text":"This is for their separate sit-down style noodle/soup restaurant.  I was very surprised to see that Ohana offers Pho, Ramen, Soup Dumplings, etc. at this location.  (If only they could bring this to my area!)

We came for the Soup Dumplings especially.  Joe Shanghai's in NYC is the standard to which I hold all soup dumplings.  \"These tender pouches, \"little dumplings\", are freshly made to order. They arrive at the table in piping hot bamboo steamers. Each plump dumpling contains a little pork meatball surrounded by a delightful meaty broth.\"

If you have not had soup dumplings, it's almost like dumpling pot stickers, that have hot broth inside that you drink as soon as you bite into the dumpling.  

I hope they owners read this and try to improve on their version of the soup dumpling.   They price was cheap for 10 dumplings and they served it in a silver dish but I had to ask for a soup spoon (the best way to eat it).

My wife and I found that it was random where maybe  only 1/2 of the dumplings had a substantial amount of broth.   It might be the outer layer not being thick enough to hold the soup or idk.   It was just a little disappointing to bite into a few and not get anything out of it.  The broth itself was decent at best.    The dumpling meat was also just okay.   Steal Fat Dumplings recipe, throw in some soup.... I will come back and tell everyone to come too!

We also ordered a shrimp eggroll appetizer which was good and a pan fried noodle dish which was delicious and a great portion.   

There's not many options for xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in Vegas so I'll give this one another try sometime until I find something near comparable to those in NYC."}
{"text":"This place is really great, and I have no concerns about it, regarding negativity. Ohana Hawaiian has great food, servers, and a great restaurant itself (beside the small area).

     Upon entering, you'll notice an easy- access entrance into their other location : Hawaiian BBQ Noodles (it's basically the same thing, but it just serves some additional orders, like noodles). 

    The service here is just as great here too! All the employees are very friendly, and sweet. From what I think, I can't even recall any problems I had here."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday in the early evening with cravings. I had the mini loco moco and was a very happy girl. With the \"mini\" loco moco, you get the following: 1 egg, 1 beef patty, 1 scoop of rice, and 1 scoop of mac salad. It was good enough for one person, or maybe two people on a diet. Definitely don't get the larger meals unless you are sharing or want to save some for later.

I don't like mac salad, so I can't tell you how that tasted, but the rest of my dish was tasty. Flavoring was right and tasted almost like I was in Hawaii. Also, I had great service here. : ) I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there with the homie.

The place was busy and the service was quick. I had the BBQ beef bowl with a side of Mac salad. The veggies were prepared nice and al dente, the meat was tender and flavorful.

My buddy had BBQ beef lunch and with two soft drinks it was all less than $18.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The young woman behind the counter was so polite! It was a pleasant surprise for her to ask about our day while we ordered our food.  It has a very family run atmosphere.  We ordered at the counter and it was brought to our table by another very polite woman.  Food was awesome!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection to choose from and they don't stop at hawaiian offerings.  They also have chinese food!     The prices are good and the portions are good.

We ordered the BBQ mix, spam masubi, and the gravy fries.  All satisfying.  I would order them all again.

Edit:  tried their combination fried rice. It had large shrimp and there were plenty of them.  Alot of restaurants skimp on the shrimp. Not them!"}
{"text":"Wife took me to this place after her coworker recommended it. The decor was nice and the place was clean, which is always a good start. I ordered the chicken katsu curry. My wife ordered kalua pig. She also ordered spring rolls. 

The katsu was perfectly cooked. It was thin and crispy and delicious. The curry tasted like a regular packaged yellow curry. The rice was nice and fluffy. The mac salad was okay but a little bland. It could've used a little more seasoning if you asked me.

My wife's kalua pig had a nice smoky aroma. It was very tender and mixed with lots of cabbage. It was not dry at all and the juices mixed well with the rice.

I didn't particularly enjoy the spring roll only because it wasn't what I was expecting. The wrap was crispy and not too oily. The filling was a mixture of carrot, cabbage, and corn starch noodles. Perfect for speaking up the doping sauce but bland without it. 

Counter girl was nice and friendly and we didn't wait long for the food even though the restaurant was about half full. Really good place for staples like kalua pig, katsu, and BBQ from what I hear."}
{"text":"Super yummy fast food Hawai'ian Style. The counter staff are friendly - know the menu very well. The BBQ Combo is my fav - and tasty as always. This location is pretty new. Very clean and modern looking."}
{"text":"First time here! The service was great! The girls are so sweet and genuine. I got the chicken catsu (delicious) and gravy frys"}
{"text":"Great food and they give you the option of walk in OR table service! I am never disappointed with the bbq salmon! It's a fav..craved it my entire pregnancy..yum!!"}
{"text":"A nice new restaurant BUT that's about it!  Large portion but quality is NOT up to par.. I got the trio combo meats(chicken,slice beef and galbi) all lack in flavors and the beef is so damn chewy.  

The side Mac salad is so bland!!!! Never coming to any ohana restaurants anymore and I'm afraid to try their new restaurant Taste which is rt next door (same owner).

Oh I do not like the peach tea, awful.. too sweet and weird taste.  The tea milk w grass jelly was decent Not great.."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local Hawaiian Places! Always try something new on the menu and nothing we have tried has been disappointing!"}
{"text":"Very good hawaiian food. The katsu sauce is good and not too watery or BBQ like. They have Hawaiian Sun too!!! And their spam musubi is really good. 
Overall I like it because it is as close to getting real Hawaiian food off the island."}
{"text":"5 stars by far place is super busy but worth the wait! Food is great staff is friendly, and accommodating. Seating area is small but the kitchen is open to watch them cook. First  and only hawaiian bbq place I'll eat at. If you are picky like me it's a big step to try it but I wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday. They have Chinese food!

We ordered Mongolian Beef, Salt & Pepper Squid, Salt & Pepper Pork, and Chicken Katsu.

I must say that their Chinese food is far better than their Hawaiian food. The squid and pork are just spiced enough to keep your lips tingling. The beef is deliciously marinated. The katsu was a disappointment though. You can get chicken katsu anywhere else and it would be better.

Salt & Pepper Squid and Salt & Pepper Pork is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times for a quick lunch. Space is clean, food is made quickly. However, menu is a bit haphazard. Lots of choices on the menu and the walls and even in the little table inserts. It is almost overwhelming to choose. But once you decide, it is a good choice for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been here enough times (since it's so close to my work and they deliver).  I think it's about time I left a review:

  They have a pretty good menu, the selections are not as grand as other Hawaiian BBQ joints, but everything they do offer is on point!  
  I swear this place is evil.  If someone dares to mention it at work, a post it note with 3 people's order of choice turns into a whole sheet of paper with side notes (i.e. \"Katsu well-done please\").  

  Today I went with the Katsu Curry, but I have tried everything on the menu from Garlic Shrimp to their Saimen.  The Katsu Curry is pretty amazing.  The Curry sauce comes on the side so it doesn't leave my Chicken Katsu extra soggy.   I got a mini portion (there's also a regular portion) and there was plenty of food for 2 sittings.  If you work nearby or are shopping at the Target and in the mood for some local food, check this place out.

Pros:
 *  They deliver (within reason)
 *  Huge portions.  (you can seriously split the regular sized plates)
 * Hawaiian Sun (this is a must... Lilikoi Passion... Mmmm!
 * Self Serve pop
 * Lunch specials for the price of the mini plates  ($4.95!)
 * Grilled Salmon  !!!!!
 * Loco Moco !!!!!
Cons:
 * I'm not really fond of their Mac Salad. 
 * Saimen @ Ohana's is a bit bland for me
 * Food is good, but sometimes its an overkill with their sauce.
 * No Mochiko Chicken 

Tips:
 * Try their Grilled Salmon plate!
 * Order the sauce on the side.
 * They also have burger/fries.  I'm just saying.
 * Try to avoid dining in during lunch hours.  It is hectic!
 * If you work nearby, have them fax you a menu!

Overall, I'd have to say I'm definitely a fan of this place.  How can I not be? Cheap eats, quick service, and man vs. food portions.  I'm in !"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall with great food. It's a local gem! Glad I found this place for my Hawaiian cravings."}
{"text":"This place is A-ok like the rating says.  My \"go to place\" if you will, when im craving some teriyaki or spam musubi.  Main reason is the prices.  That's it... try it ... you might like it!"}
{"text":"I work by this place.  I am a fan of L&L so I figured I would check this place for lunch.  It took a lot of trial and error to find a hawaiian dish that I liked.  Sorry, the food is different.  So, I ordered the classic chicken katsu.  I ordered the half because it was lunch time and I didn't want to go into a coma during the last part of the day.  I ordered the mini with no mac salad.  I have to say they make a mean chicken katsu.  It was cooked well and the sauce was tasty.  The rice wasn't overcooked  either.  I go back from time to time.  Check it out and try their katsu.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great, although it took me awhile to find something I really like.  I also realized that I wrote the review for this location on their Blue Diamond location yelp page.  This place is right down the street from where I work.  I used to get this garlic chicken dish at L&L all the time.  They didn't have a dish like this, so I tried the Chicken Katsu.  They make the chicken Katsu perfect! I can't get enough of it, but that's not a problem because if you get the regular plate you get a ton of food.  At lunch I will get the mini and I get stuffed and spend the afternoon in a food coma.  I did get the regular at dinner once and 2 people can easily share the plate.  In fact I think a family of 4 could even share the plate!  I also tried their bar b Que chicken musubi.  I haven't tried musubi before and now I'm hooked.  Go check this place out and you won't be disappointed!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"So went to order food for take out. While waiting for food to be cooked, used the restroom and in there was another person. Heard them use the restoom, did NOT here them use the sink. And who was it that walks out of the restroom, an employee. Not just any employee, one of the chefs. Decided to let him know that he needed to wash his hands, but he thought likewise and ignored me. So went to the front and let the cashier/ food orderer what happened. She decided to argue for her fellow employee. So after much arguing and debate I made sure that the dirty chef did not go any where near where the food was being cooked till I got my food and left. If they don't think its neccessary for any type of food handlers to wash their hands after using the restroom then they are disgusting morons! Never going back to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is going downhill fast. Used to love coming here when they had young energetic people working at the counter providing great customer service. 3 reasons why you should just eat next door or anywhere else nearby. 1. All you have to look forward to most of the time is a grumpy old woman (who im assuming is the owner) who provides no customer service. 2. They stopped serving water for free. In Las Vegas where it's 140 degrees you have to buy a 3$ water if that's what you want to drink. And 3! You can even use a debit card to purchase a meal under 10$. No cards at all if you want to eat lunch...this is 2015 nobody carries cash anymore. Stupid rules and horrible service standards is all the reason I need to just go across the street and get the best Hawaiian food in town at ISLAND FLAVOR! Trust me you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Once my friend and I came in, we were greeted and seated. Service was top notch. Our waitress was so kind and offered suggestions since we were unsure of what to order. We ordered chicken musubi, beef noodles, BBQ combo, cream cheese and pineapple rangoons and Thai and milk teas for only $30. Awesome restaurant, delicious food and exceptional service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BETTER than L&L BBQ! Chicken BBQ here is the best!

I have gone here probably a dozen times in the last couple months. 
I find that their chicken bbq is not as fatty as the L&L bbq. It doesn't have fat hanging off it and it tastes better.

The other favorite is the katsu chicken and the katsu sauce. If I can only get that recipe for that sauce, I'd be a happy girl.. =) Place is friendly. Asking for extra katsu sauce is a hit and miss depending on the girl that workds the register. Sometimes you get charged 50 cents, sometimes not. 

They have BOBA here for $2.50 which is the cheapest I have seen in town not even in china town!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has been right under my nose all this time!

Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is located on the southwest corner of Warm Springs and Eastern Avenue. 

Wanting to try something new, we found this place on Yelp!. Luckily, the place was empty when we got there yesterday, so we were able to step and up and order something right away! The young lady was polite and answered a bunch of questions about menu items without showing the slightest agitation. 

I opted for the 2/2 combo, which allowed me to choose 2 meats to have with my sides of rice(2 scoops) and mac salad(1 scoop)($9.75). I chose the Hawaiian BBQ chicken and hamburger steak. How do you go wrong there, right? My friend decided to go with the Hawaiian Combo mix(also $9.75). We ordered a couple of small drinks and I honestly can't remember the price for drinks, but I can tell you they serve Pepsi products(Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist, etc) and refills are free.

The place was clean and set up nice for the small area they have, with plenty of booths and tables available. They also have a TV set up on the wall playing ESPN. I definitely enjoy that!

I was pleased with how everything was going to this point, but now it was all about the food!

Arriving in styrofoam containers, the first thing that struck me was portion size. For your money, you get a healthy amount of food. Not only that, they certainly don't skimp on the meat portions! 

The chicken was freaking phenomenal! Extraordinarily tender and juicy, I found myself woofing that down in no time! The hamburger steak was tasty, as well. Covered in gravy, think a really, really good salisbury steak! I hadn't had salisbury steak in forever!

The rice was alright. You did recieve 2 scoops, so the portion was plentiful. It was a nice change of pace enjoying the mac salad. It's not too often I see this as a side, with the exception of some sub shops. 

I have a pretty hearty appetite and can definitely put it away, but I actually had to finish this off later at home!

I really enjoyed this place and have already made plans to  go back very soon to try other items on the menu! Can't find a good reason to knock a star off of their rating, so its ..

5 stars!"}
{"text":"If your in the mood for Hawaiian bbq this is the place! Food quality and prices are good. I recommend trying the shrimp curry!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly people. The girl that wrote the bad review about your credit card... Who doesn't bring their card anyway? Always be prepared to show your card. If you can't, you're scandalous! #UsePettyCash (oh wait, you're hourly) #PettyTrash"}
{"text":"Will not order pickup from here ever again.

Messed up my order twice. 3 Trips going there and back.

Manager was not accommodating at all."}
{"text":"Awesome! Much more convenient for me EVERY TIME I COME!
AWESOME EVERY TIME!!
Delicious food, Great people, awesome customer service and it keeps me COMING BACK FOR MORE! Thank you for always hooking it up Cheyne!!!
Ask for her if you want the best of Ohana Hawaiian BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Not the best plate lunch i've had. 

But being that it is local and their prices definitely reasonable, i'll be back often. 

I tried the katsu and garlic shrimp. The katsu sauce was kinda watered down but good nonetheless and the garlic shrimp was ok. I dont think ill get the shrimp again though. Just didn't seem worth it. 

The BBQ mix plate is insanely huge and can easily feed 2 people, but being it was my first time here we got a bunch of stuff just to try out.

Next time its gonna be BBQ mix plate and the katsu."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I eat here probably once or twice a week. We've been there so often that we're on a first name basis with the staff; the cashier sees us come in, and all we have to say is, \"The usual!\" The employees are friendly and willing to chat. Prices are almost unbelievably cheap for how much food they give you. He always gets the barbecue beef with double rice, no macaroni salad, and I get the lemon chicken, lemon sauce on the side.
First, the beef. The best way I can describe it is juicy beef jerky, and even though that sounds weird, it's definitely a good thing! I've eaten it dozens of times now, and I still can't identify what's in the marinade. Soy sauce, garlic, honey? The flavor is too complicated for me to discern the individual flavors, but I don't really care. It's so tasty I just want to eat it, not ponder it's creation.
Second, the lemon chicken. Fresh from the fryer, crispy and tender. Really just perfectly cooked. Then, the lemon sauce. It's lemony and sweet, but enough tartness to keep it interesting.
Overall, this place is an incredible deal, with tasty food and friendly, knowledgable staff."}
{"text":"If \"ohana\" means family, what's the Hawaiian word for tasty?

Nothing fancy here, just straight up Hawaiian styled food. I've been trying to eat less carbs lately and I figured maybe a giant plate of meat would be fine for lunch.

I ordered the BBQ Mix plate with chicken, short ribs, and BBQ beef. This massive BBQ plate is a great lunch fix and for anyone who needs that premium protein boost. The chicken was very tender and plentiful and the BBQ beef was perfect! I could have eaten the entire cow if it came prepared like this.

The Short Rib on the other had almost no meat on it at all. I know short ribs don't normally have a ton meat on them, but usually there's a little to nibble on. This small set back didn't ruin my lunch, I mean; I still had three pounds of chicken and BBQ beef to eat. 

As a wild card option I ordered the Chicken Katsu Musubi. This was very interesting, but also very good. The crunchy katsu chicken with the soft sticky rice was a great combo. They have multiple musubi options including the classic spam musubi, just incase katsu chicken isn't your thing. 

With my sodium levels through the roof and my belly full, I would say that this was lunchtime victory. Would I come back? - Duh

Mahalo!"}
{"text":"I think what I liked best from this place was the thai tea w/boba..I got the wonton soup with ramen noodles I'm sorry but I threw it away the wonton was ok it was made with shrimp..and the hot mustard tasted like the mustard u put on hot dogs not the kind u eat with saimen..I was very disappointed I was craving for saimen so bad I guess I have to drive downtown at the Cal to get s.o.s saimen..my bf got the mix bbq he said the beef tasted good..sorry I probably will only come here for the Thai tea"}
{"text":"Great food and quick service!! Love that they do Chinese food and Hawaiian BBQ. The prices are reasonable for the large portions you get. It's never crowded but you can tell they do good business because there are always people in there."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service in a small store. Whenever I dine-in, I try to sit in the back because the tables up front are so close, every time someone walks in or out, there's always a cold breeze.

On their food--
Their spam musubis are always thick, however they can sometimes be dry/lack a good amount of sauce. 
Their mini kalua pig plate are good enough to satisfy me, but I'm a pretty small person, so I would suggest a regular.
Omg, their malasadas! Perfect. They're very consistent: always have a thick, crunchy outside layer, but once you bite into it they're so soft and moist! Yum.
I hate teriyaki chicken, but when my mom brings home a plate from this location, I don't mind digging in.

I would spend my money for drinks elsewhere though."}
{"text":"I always order online delivery from this location. Their estimated time is on point almost every time.

Food:
* I highly recommend trying their garlic shrimp plate, so savory! 
* The saimin here reminds me of back home in Hawaii.
* In my opinion, their musubi is pretty overpriced (1.95) considering how dry they usually are.
* Get the Hawaiian Sun Drink! Any of 'em!! You will not be disappointed. I just wish they had the Iced Tea flavor, but NO ONE carries that except International.
* The portions are perfect, however I always substitute the mac salad for extra rice. Nothing wrong with how they make it though, I've just never been a fan of mac salad.

Ohana BBQ is surprisingly better than competitors like Island Sushi & Grill (not compared to their sushi obviously). I would definitely suggest for friends to stop by."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Hawaiian fast food, that's it.  It reminds me of the mall kiosk back home kind of fast food."}
{"text":"TWO THUMBS UP! Very delicious and appetizing! Me and my cousin were out exploring restaurants. Since my cousin tried this restaurant before, she recommended me to try this restaurant. Since I LOVE Hawaiian food and I haven't had Hawaiian food for over four years now, I gave it a shot. Me, my cousin, and my brother came in on Saturday, September 30, 2017 around 8 p.m. and we dined in.

We ordered:
- Seafood and BBQ Combo
- BBQ Mix Combo
- Chicken Katsu

OH MY! The portion was huge and lots of meat! When I had my first bite of my Chicken Katsu, I felt like I was in heaven! The flavor was just so good and very crispy! Especially dipping in the sauce! Mmm... I felt like I can eat it everyday for the rest of my life! I also tried a Breaded Shrimp in the Seafood and BBQ Combo, very good! I was stunned that I finished my food because it's really good!

If you ever want to eat or try Hawaiian food, eat here! This location just opened a few weeks ago and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming. The staff here are friendly and welcoming. Don't worry, this Hawaiian restaurant company is not a franchise. Every table here has a USB plug wall charger as well, very convenient!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I only gave it 5 stars because it's not worthy of it, meaning you don't get an out of body experience when eating here. I have to hand it to them though, their Manapua is really good. But then again there are no other places in Vegas to compare it to, so they get mega props on that. The chicken katsu is good but I don't like the after taste it leaves in your mouth and the hamburger is the same way, you are left burping it up all night, some sort of garlicky flavor and that drives me insane. The hawaiian bbq chicken is good. The saimin sucks, they don't give much and it has a weird taste. They sell malasadas but if you've ever ate malasadas from Hawaii, then you will think these are \"ok i guess\". They have daily plate specials for $4.95. Oh and the curry plates are righteous and the macaroni salad has taste!"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp chow fun for pickup. The shrimp was cooked excellently, two stars. One star because the food was ready fast.
Now if u like chewing ur noodles for about 40 seconds then choking on it because the texture is too sticky and they're stuck together, then by all means order the chow fun. It also had zero taste and left much to be desired. Make sure u have a drink on hand to wash it down in case u cant hack it back up. This dish is absolutely NOT worth the price they charge. Will stick to China a go go."}
{"text":"This place is me and my boyfriend's go-to restaurants when we want good Hawaiian food. We're guilty of always getting the same thing we usually get but it's hard to break away from our favorites like the Garlic Shrimp, Chicken Katsu, and the Gyozas. And I love me some Gyozas! The service is always friendly - never stuck up or make you feel stupid for not knowing what you want. The food is always hot and ready at a decent time. But I've had 2 instances where they've gotten my order wrong where they put mac and rice together when I specifically ordered it to be all rice. Other than, it's a great find & convenient location! Right next to Baskin Robbins too which is my fave!"}
{"text":"Great food for an amazing price....bought the Kalua Pork and Lau Lau..which could easily feed 2...The garlic shrimps were good...their coleslaw with the rice is so yummmm. Must try"}
{"text":"My local go-to spot, just down the street. Food is good but the Chicken Katsu Musubi is a must! They have a variety of food to choose from and I am never disappointed with the selection here. This place is much better than the more well known Hawaiian joint that shall remain nameless. Lol."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! This is the best Hawaiian food I've found out here. Service is stellar, atmosphere is nice and clean, and I can't get enough of their food! 
Chicken Katsu is yummy white meat (unlike LL, with brown meat! Yuck!) with the perfect amount of breading. The crab Rangoon and sauce is sweet and delicious. Prices are unbeatable!
So full! Time for a nap!"}
{"text":"This place was better than I expected. Some people wrote bad reviews. I was hungry and this was the closest place to eat. Food was delicious and came in good portions."}
{"text":"This place gives great sized portions, which is why I always opt for the mini because I can at least finish it. When I do get the regular sized portion of chicken Katsu I always opt for fried rice instead of white rice if I'm craving it - their fried rice is good! They make the chicken Katsu sauce just right. 

I usually get the chicken Katsu mini with a spam musubi on the side.

Chicken Katsu is always a favorite for me! Especially from this place! :)"}
{"text":"This place isn't good for you, but who cares. I've had a few spam musubis in my time and thought I just didn't like it, until I tried it here. So. Good. Hot, yummy spam, perfect little bit of teriyaki, seaweed wrapper you can chew through, perfect warm rice with just enough stick. I finished it on the car ride home. And I was driving. Garlic shrimp noodles were delish, crispy fried fish, addictive bbq chicken and kalua pork. Next time I have to try the salt and pepper shrimp or calamari. And the gyoza. And saimin. And one or two more musubi."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu or BBQ short ribs is definitely the way to go if it's your first time, also try a Thai tea boba. All really good items on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good, similar food to a Chinese restaurant. The pineapple chicken had excellent flavor. The appearance of the establishment was mediocre. Took 10-15 to get food, considering that the there were 10 people inside. Overall a good mid-day lunch experience."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and really enjoy the food, sometimes. Most of the time things are great, then other times, my food will be cooked and served completely differently than before or things will be left out of my to go order. I've had the salt and pepper shrimp on several occasions and it's come cooked pan fried a few times (which is great) and then deep fried in a tempura type batter with a completely different taste other times (which is absolutely awful.) I've ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry bowl several times and it has always been served to me with the curry on the side in a separate bowl, until today which leads me to the purpose of my review. Today I received the bowl with just a little bit of curry already on top of the chicken. It was nowhere near the amount  that comes in the bowl served on the side that I usually get. The chicken was on top of dry potatoes, dry carrots and dry rice. After a few AWESOME bites it was clear that the rest of the bowl was going to need more curry. I asked one of the girls at the front if I could get just a little bit more for the rest of the dish. She pulled up the information on the register and told me that it would be an additional $0.50. I was shocked  considering I was only asking for a little bit more and felt that I had been shorted to begin with.  So I dug around in my bag to see if I had any change and I didn't. I told her I was completely willing to pay the $0.50 except that they had a $10 minimum on cards. Her response was a very sweet smile and an \"Oh, sorry.\" With no other options, I went back to my table, took a few more bites and had to throw the rest away.

For the quality and taste of their food, I would give them 4 stars-- when they get it right of course. I really do like the food and the place is always busy. It's just that there is no guarantee that I'll get the same thing.

For all of the inconsistencies, I would give them 1 star.

For refusing to give me 2 tablespoons of curry because I could not meet the $10 minimum purchase requirement, I give them a hardcore 0 stars and a firm statement that they have lost my business FOREVER.

I will have to find some place else and that's disappointing because I'll really miss their soups. :("}
{"text":"Really good macaroni salad. The food is great and so is the service. Prices are what you would expect for take out Hawaiian. Super yummy. We come here at least twice a month. Call ahead for carry-out :)"}
{"text":"Great price great food. Ribs sometimes tend to have too much fat. But great flaver. Only thing they don't have free water for customers."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month for lunch, being that I work near by. I normally order the loco moco. Its very good and filling and taste just as if I got it from Hawaii.  Their macaroni salad is made w the perfect mayo and seasoning  My lunch break is an hour long and it takes them just 10 min to have it ready to go. I recommend anyone who's craving a good Hawaiian style loco moco plate to definitely order it here. Haven't tried anything else only because I don't want to miss out on the loco moco plate. It gets me every time"}
{"text":"1st Time here, looked up some lunch places near work  and thought I'd try this place out. It was WORTH IT! I had the Spam Musubi and Garlic Noodles.. So flavorful.. I will definitely be going back! Staff was very friendly as well and good prices."}
{"text":"When I am looking for fast, cheap, good Hawaiian eats in Vegas, I stop here.  Love the marination that they use on their meats.  Great malasadas too!"}
{"text":"They're really worth the wait in line to eat here. I can't get over the BBQ Chicken. It's so juicy & tender. I will be back next time I've craving BBQ Chicken. Their Portuguese Sausage is good also.

The portions are enormous for the price. You must check it out. I was skeptical as well.

The Pineapple chicken sounds more promising.."}
{"text":"Every time we order ... is every time we happy. Like this place on this location. Nice chef & also nice cashier"}
{"text":"Ohana's is fantastic! I have to say that every time I've dined here or either did take out I've received very good customer service! That of course goes hand and hand with providing excellent food as well! Though i only eat the same thing every time it's consistent and works for me! The chicken katsu and spam masubis are my favorite! In comparison to Aloha kitchen I have to give it to Ohana's! Not only are they more convenient for me but they just happen to have better quality! Solely my option but anyways keep up the great work Ohana's!!!!! Sincerely, your Happy and satisfied  returning customer :-)"}
{"text":"Just okay.... nothing special to report here."}
{"text":"We were in the area today so stopped in for a quick lunch. I had the mini shrimp with rice and noodles. She had the same thing but with beef.

The shrimp were not peeled so I had to peel them myself. And the beef tended to have a bit too much gristle in it.

The rice was OK. Neither one of us liked the macaroni noodles..

The water was excellent."}
{"text":"2nd time here and still just as amazed. Girlfriend and I stopped by for a meal the other day l, not knowing much about this place. Have to say it was way, way above our expectations!

Staff is very friendly, food is delicious, and prices are good as well. Loco Moco is by far the best I've had from a local place!

Totally recommend it to anyone looking for a quick bite or a big dinner!"}
{"text":"Yelped Hawaiian bbq! Big portions,excellent service ! I ordered the combo spam eggs and rice and chicken katsu . Hubs ordered the chicken, Kalbi combo ! You get free crab Rangoon's with 20 purchase! Food is good ! Reasonably priced and big portions !!"}
{"text":"Really good Hawaiian bbq portions are big macaroni salad is spot on, the chicken Katsu was really good, and the wait staff was friendly will be back"}
{"text":"I actually really like this place.  The food is good and the restaurant is clean.  However, when my husband picked up dinner for us tonight and I was eating my noodles I found a piece of plastic in my food that made me lose my appetite.  The worse part?  (Or maybe the best part?  Depending on how you look at it) I had just started eating, so I didn't have very much for dinner, which was rather disappointing.  Which means it might be a while before I return."}
{"text":"Good size portions and foods is really good.  They even have Chinese food options on the menu like Chow Fun noodles and salt & pepper calamari, shrimp, etc.  Laid back atmosphere with pleasant music and seating.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Compared to L&L and aloha Hawaiian BBQ, I like ohana the best. Their daily specials are a cant beat deal. I also like their Chinese menu items. It's a nice change of pace sometimes. Loco moco is probably the best thing here."}
{"text":"Again, my boyfriend and I have recently relocated near this area so I'm looking for food places that are \"cheat-day worthy\". While the service is quick and the staff is friendly, I only gave this place 3-stars. In my opinion, it was filthy. The floors were dirty and the tables were sticky. I've visited this place 2x now, both times it wasn't as clean as I hoped it would be. It may have just been the staff working on those particular days that don't clean as often, idk. 

I would suggest ordering to-go. The food is decent. It's always hot and fresh when it finally arrives at our table. Good job chefs! 

Again, only thing you guys need to work on is cleanliness. Other than that, it's a decent place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I was craving a local style Hawaiian plate, and I think this is one of the best places to get it from in Las Vegas! Yes! Better than L&L (referring to the ones here in the mainland!)

When you walk in, the aroma of grilled Hawaiian BBQ just smacks you hard in the face - and that's a good thing! 

The cashier is smiling and already setting the tone for your Aloha experience. 

I placed my order and waited, not too soon after, the place packed! All sorts of people but many I could tell where of island descent.

I over heard one order where the braddah was making a couple special requests and the cashier turned around to the kitchen opening and yelled, \"Dad!\" She told him the special request and he nodded.

I smiled, it sends you back to the days of true family restaurants where that was the team, which in turn creates the experience for customers.

I like that!

The food is amazing, full of island flavah! They also offer chinese food, catering services, and they now deliver too within a 4 mile radius!

To my local 808-erz! Dis da place wit' broke yo face Ono Kine GrindZ! Aloha exists here!

Mahalo Nui Loa!

{"text":"A flock of locals from Hawaii tend to be joining the Las Vegas population so it's no wonder that there are tons of local kind grindz restaurants popping up in LV.  Finding Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is a taste of home in this desert town.  

Considering that this is more or less a casual fast food dining experience, the service is outstanding.  A friendly welcome when you step in and they bring your food, utensils and drinks directly to your table without you having to get up after you order.  The decor of the restaurant itself is simple and clean.  A large plasma screen and a gorgeous picture of Waikiki beach with Diamond Head in the background adorned the walls.  

There were four of us girls so we decided to order a bunch of items to share.  A bbq mixed plate which consisted of 2 scoops of rice, mac salad, bbq chicken, teri beef, and short ribs.  The meats were marinated really well so that each piece was full of flavor and my favorite part about it?  None of the pieces of the meat was tough!  From the chicken to the teri beef to the ribs, tender, not overcooked and soft.  It's nice when you aren't wrestling with your meal with the possiblity that the meat is going to beat you and tear your teeth out.  

We also ordered a couple of spam musubis and saimin.  Spam musubi and saimin is a great combo for some reason.  It totally complements each other.  The soup base for the saimin was tasty and the spam musubi's were teri-sauce delish!  

Stuffed and ready to take our money back from the casinos...our party got up to leave.  Ohana BBQ staff truly know how to show their Aloha.  A sincere thanks and au revoir to us and we were on our merry way. 

Truly, a great, warm tasting \"Aloha\" experience."}
{"text":"Last night, I ordered a Spam Musubi.  While it was made fresh, the nori was very dry to the point where it was like eating a dry sheet of seaweed.  It wasn't very impressive.

Also, I ordered the BBQ Mix plate and while the chicken was great, the beef was about 15% fat.  The serving size of rice and macaroni salad seems to have gone down to a shameful amount.  The macaroni salad was good... all three fork fulls of it.

No courtesy cup for water!  I was forced to by a drink.  The drink selection from the soda fountain is VERY limited. :(

The price is much more expensive then other alternatives. If it was not Monday night, I would've been grinding at Island Flavor right down the street instead."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service. Table was kind of sticky. But no other complaints. They give you big containers of katsu sauce as well."}
{"text":"Last night I was talked into ordering Hawaiian food for dinner by everyone at work.  I've only had it once before and I was not impressed with the exception of Malasadas, which are pretty good.  So I ordered the \"Mini\" order of Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, which came with steamed rice.  The rice was good.  However, the chicken was not.  My stomach has been doing cartwheels all night.  I even found a piece in there that was not cooked all the way through and had to throw it out (undercooked chicken can be toxic).  The rest of the chicken really had no flavor to speak of.  I thought it was very bland.  Most of my co-workers were unimpressed as well.  Not to mention, they were very slow at getting our order prepared and nothing was labeled when we got it back to work.  The Malasadas were good, but the ones I had before had a nice tropical cream inside of them.  These had no filling.  However, they were fine and probably the only thing I would order from them again.  I was truly unimpressed.  Maybe it loses something when you get it to go, although there is no excuse for undercooked and bland chicken.  It's going to be awhile before I eat Hawaiian food again.  Mahalo."}
{"text":"My go to place. You get so much food! I usually get the pad thai and chicken Katsu. The pad thai is less flavorful, but also served with shrimp. I love the macaroni salad that comes in the chicken katsu."}
{"text":"I kept passing over Ohana because it's right next to a chinese food place, and since I'm Jewish, well - that's self explanatory. Chinese food won every time.

I've been sick all week, didn't want to cook, needed to eat something, and definitely didn't want chinese food. I figured BBQ was a safe option; grilled meats and rice probably wouldn't tear my stomach up too badly. 

I am SO glad that I came in to eat here. I got the mixed BBQ; short ribs, chicken, beef, served with two scoops of rice, macaroni salad, and mixed greens. Absolutely delicious. The meat was flavorful and tender, I washed it down with pineapple-orange juice, and I had more than enough for a doggy bag to go home with. All for $10.

I'm going back tomorrow to try some other stuff; I was extremely impressed and genuinely can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"We've visited this place several times before and they have the always reliable Hawaiian favorites from combo platters, musubi and loco moco. This time we tried the relatively new table service section and ordered from the \"Noodles\" menu. Here it wasn't strictly Hawaiian with Vietnamese (pho), Chinese (soup dumplings) and Japanese (ramen) selections. 

Loved the grilled pork chops. The pork soup dumplings were not the best we've tried but ok... much improved with the dipping sauce that comes with it. The pork belly buns was the most impressive - good flavor and almost melt-in your-mouth tender. Also loved the free refills on the sweetened passion fruit iced tea. 

Finally, the service was great. Food came out fast and the wait staff was very attentive. 

We're very happy to have a reliable go to Hawaiian/Asian place."}
{"text":"I have several favorite Hawaiian food spots in Las Vegas.  At each of my favorite hawaiian spot I have a my \"regulars.\"

At Ohana Hawaiian BBQ, I always either get their Kalua Pork & Cabbage (so juicy and tastey), their Chicken Katsu Curry (Currys sauce is hawaiian curry, so dont be quit to assume its a certain way), and their BBQ Mix Plate, which comes with BBQ Chickien, Kalbi and Teri Beef.  All three items are my ABSOLUTE fave and you cannot go wrong with any.

I always call ahead for pick up and they're very quick with service."}
{"text":"Good - I personally prefer Durango location but this is my second choice. No issues or concerns. Their menu selections are similar and often had daily specials. They also have their noodle shop next door."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service !
Food always fresh and delicious (Ono)!
Prefer this location over the others; have catered before. Good - reasonable.
Come hungry leave full and satisfied wanting more Ono grinds."}
{"text":"People need to learn to listen.  I called in an order and requested CHOPPED GREEN ONION on my loco moco..  I repeated myself 3 times and so did the girl on the phone.  I go to pick up my food and the other girl tells me, \" oh you wanted chopped green onion, but they nevah cut em up, is that okay?\"  REALLY!!!!!!!  Never again!!!  And yes for the record I was charged for it.  I even agreed to pay extra!!!!"}
{"text":"I believe Ohana is a chain correct? I don't know what it is about this particular location but their food tastes different. Even their mac salad taste nothing like the other locations. I ordered a half and half combo to go. The beef was very chewy and the chicken could of been marinated way longer, it lacked so much flavor. And they didn't include teriyaki sauce in the bag like I'm used to. I'll stick to the Durango Ohana from now on."}
{"text":"By the way this isn't our first time coming here ... We went here for lunch today .. Food is good specially being greated by nice hostess or server with a big smile .. Thanks Jan  for treating us special excellent service"}
{"text":"Stopped by today, they are out of business. The food was good, maybe too low priced? One of my favorite places, what happened? they were always pretty busy and popular.
It's a sad day. :-("}
{"text":"Ordered takeout online. Food tasted good, but they did not pack the spam musubi I paid for... I also did not get any steamed rice with my Kung pao combo... Really disappointed in the lack of attention to detail."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of great Hawaiian food... I went and tried out this restaurant. I had the combo Lau Lau and Kailua pork. The Lau Lau was 95% grape leaves and 5% pork. It was ok, but not outstanding. The Kailua pork was a bit mushy and quite frankly not great... but it was a nice sized portion :(  It came with rice and macaroni salad... again... ok but not great. I also wanted to try out their BBQ chicken. Amazingly this was the star of the show...it was fantastic! It was a drive to get here, but if I am over on this side of town, I would come back for it!! The Pepsi was also very watered down."}
{"text":"Always fast, friendly, and the food is great! I usually go to the one on eastern, but this location is just as great as the other location."}
{"text":"Been a favorite spot of mine for years. The staff is friendly and the food is great! Practically tried everything on the menu and loved it all"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Local food & ONO! Cmon down Hawaiian's you won't be disappointed...good prices on the food too!"}
{"text":"Solid Hawaiian food. I came here with my brother for a \"second dinner\" since we weren't full yet. We ordered a spam musubi, mini loco moco, and Thai ice tea. Prices were affordable like most Hawaiian places, and the portions were good for the price (i.e. good value). Service was decent for a fast food place. The interior is not big, but a lot of people tend to get takeout anyway. 

Interestingly enough, they also have several other random Asian, non-Hawaiian dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! My mom brought home their sampler plate and I had to know where it was from, went and had it again and will be back for more!! I really used to enjoy their $5.99 Salmon bowl but they do not offer it anymore! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty close to what we get as far as value and taste from a plate lunch place from Hawaii. Food came out hot and plentiful."}
{"text":"The place isn't too bad and the prices are cheaper than other Hawaiian food. It's more of a fast food joint, but way better than L&L. Everyone is always really nice and polite. I haven't really had anything there besides katsu, musubi and gravy fries. They aren't bad and I always enjoy it when I'm in the mood for fast, cheap food. I ordered the curry katsu bowl to try something new for $5.25 with a side of macaroni salad (1.00) and gravy fries. The curry katsu comes with potatoes, carrots, rice and katsu. Not too bad and not great either. The curry tastes like all the other places I tried, nothing special. The potatoes were a little too soft for me. My boyfriend ordered the small chicken katsu. Be careful of the fries!! They are scorching hot when you bite into them. Lol. The only downside is that they do not have a water fountain so they charge for water (1.25)."}
{"text":"Seriously?? One of the...worst...meals...ever.
I got a seafood and kalbi combination. The shrimp was heavily breaded, dry and flavorless. The mahi was okay. The kalbi was the worst I've ever had to the point of being nearly inedible.
Altogether one of my worst restaurant experiences, ever.
Blech!
I don't understand the good reviews, at all.

If you want fabulous Hawaiian food, check out Island Style over on Sahara. Less good, but still orders of magnitude better than Ohana, is Aloha Kitchen over on Decatur."}
{"text":"Pretty good fast Hawaiian! The chicken katsu is delicious. A little pricy in my opinion but still good"}
{"text":"I love the variety of selections here. Normally when you have so many different cuisines and dishes it makes it difficult for the food to be on point. I haven't tried all the dishes but the ones that I've tried have all been really good.

Kudos to the kitchen for being able to have so many dishes in the chamber and to deliver flawlessly with each one. 

Staff is extremely friendly and flow is great. Five stars for me."}
{"text":"Good food and fast friendly service. I don't know much about Hawaiian BBQ but this food is tasty and keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Ding, ding, ding we have a winner. From succulent BBQ pork and chicken/beef teriyaki to tender, perfectly breaded chicken katsu this place truly has Hawaiian BBQ down to a science. Although every time I head in here this place is crazy busy I don't care because I just want to get the food in my mouth and don't mind waiting for it.

The service is quick and friendly, and they are always happy to explain any of the plates to you if you ask. They also provide catering at what seems to be a pretty good price. Can't wait to go back for lunch."}
{"text":"ordered a bbq mix for pick up. everything was cooked just right and the servings are perfect to share."}
{"text":"Food awesome, (bbq chicken bowl and bbq beef bowl) so fresh!!! so much flavor.place is very clean all employees very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Ono food, not bad prices, awesome customer service - on the phone & face to face, what more can I say? Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and large portions. Fast friendly service. Big menu and comfortable inviting atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place has awesome Katsu and BBQ chicken. Priced right and portions get us full. Customer Service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent Hawaiian food. We ordered to go and service was pretty fast. The spam musubi here was yummy! Good rice to spam ratio, because nothing sucks more than having too much rice. I ordered the pineapple chicken and I thought it was good! Wish the chicken was a little more crispy tho. It's nothing special just similar to L&L or Aloha Kitchen. Only thing I didn't like was that they charged for wontons and at some places like China go go it's usually on the house."}
{"text":"Being fairly new to the Las Vegas area (from the east coast), I've been looking for that \"go to\" take out restaurant.  This one my family really enjoys.  It's not too expensive, though I can't call it cheap... yet the food is tasty leaving me full without out feeling heavy.  It's increasingly becoming our \"go to\"!  We usually order the chicken and steak tip combo w/ rice and macaroni salad."}
{"text":"Food is serviceable, although portions run a little small. But what puts me off about this eatery is the lack of aloha in the service. Whether you eat here or take out, you're given the same cheap plastic cutlery and styrofoam box. The front staff on both occasions have been different ladies but neither seemed very interested or helpful. Even if you eat three feet from the cash register, there will be no further acknowledgement of you, no inquiry of if everything is delicious or not. Ohana means family in Hawaii, but they must be talking about each other, because they certainly don't mean the customer."}
{"text":"I used to think L & L Hawaiian Barbeque made the best Chicken Katsu in town until I discovered this little gem.  Their seafood platter is pretty good too.  It's right at the corner of Durango and Warm Springs in the Vons shopping center.  

(Speaking of the shopping center, I have to make a little side review.  This place has a Japanese, Italian, Hawaiian, Chinese, a Coldstone Creamery, and a Buffalo Wild Wings all in the same complex!  And you wonder why I never bother to cook?)"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything from here besides the salmon, which was alright. 

But, I LOOOOVE their Thai tea with boba, its my favorite."}
{"text":"Came in here about 9pm today and ordered the fried shrimp combo and it was really good. As soon as the clock hit 9:30pm they were telling people to leave even if you were still eating.. I just thought that was kind of rude. Other than that, the food was good."}
{"text":"This place gets one star because of their terrible policy of cash or card. I tried to get some of their food but in order to pay with my debit card I have to purchase $10 at least? What kind of bs is that? I'll never go back to this location. Get with the times. People have debit cards!!"}
{"text":"I love their food! The portion is huge and I like everything I've tried. I just wish I I have the option of kim chi instead of macaroni salad"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick Hawaiian fix. The BBQ chicken is always sizzling here and they do a nice job with portions. My favorite is the Loco Amoco plate. Chicken Katsu is also really good. Consistently good food. Prefer to take out than eat in."}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant is so adorable. I was impressed of how clean the bathroom was. Clean bathroom = clean kitchen. The restaurant is just right on their prices. Their portions are huge! I always order the chicken katsu when I eat at Hawaiian restaurants. Their chicken is white meat, but it's not dry. It's rare for Hawaiian restaurants to use white meat. Their sauce is kind of watery, but it's still good. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here last week since I was sick, too lazy to cook, & craving island grinds. Located in a little shopping mall next to a Walmart, Coffee Hunter, & more it was pretty easy to find via google maps. It's a little restaurant but pretty clean & lot's of customers when I walked in which is always a good sign. 

We ordered the garlic shrimp plate, seafood platter, & a free order of pineapple crab rangoon thanks to the yelp app. The garlic shrimp plate was super ono, tasted authentic like from back home. Seafood platter was a bit disappointing. I thought it would be a mixture of breaded & non-breaded like fried shrimp, some grilled mahi, but alllll of it was fried heavily. Probably my fault for assuming a mixture but that's something I won't be getting again. I will say though that they use a good quality scallop in the platter which I noticed after I scraped off the heavy breading. I'm just not really a fry girl but if you're into that then you'll like it. Mac salad here is alright, not the best I've ever had. Added a lil extra to it at home to liven up the flavor. The rangoon was a nice treat. 

I'll definitely be back for some more of that garlic shrimp & to try some of the other items on the menu. Oh & did I mention it's cheap? Meals under $10 that fill you up. Mahalo."}
{"text":"It's good food for sure, but 2 stars for poor service which is disappointing. First, we called in our order for delivery. I ordered BBQ chicken saimin, the guy said it's only noodles with chicken, no soup. So I asked if they had soups. He asked what kind I wanted so I said BBQ chicken saimin. He said \"ok we can make that\". Weird, since that's what I first ordered. They said it would be about 30 min delivery. It was raining so after an hour we called to say we hadn't gotten our food. The woman's reply was \"Well, the driver left already\". Hmmmm no concern for the driver's whereabouts. I called again after another 30 mins, and told her she should consider calling her driver to check on his safety since it's raining and our food still hasn't arrived. Poor guy was soaking wet when showed up with our food. I'd eat their food again but not for delivery since the woman had no concern for well over an hour and a half for a delivery, or concern for her driver in the rain."}
{"text":"Food is great~! Price is on point, been coming here for about two weeks and they open till 11:00PM. Try their Chicken Katsu / BBQ chicken, tasty!"}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, it's very delicious! It's good when you finally get it! I would have given them 4 stars if they improve the wait time for the food. They also own the restaurant next door so they have two restaurants with one kitchen so when one side gets busy it takes forever to get your food! We ordered 2 combos and it took them 25 mins to get us our food. They were at least nice enough to give us a free Thai Tea drink w/bolba which is why I gave them 3 stars instead of 2. Hopefully they can improve on the wait time cause the food is good!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good. I had the bbq salmon bowl very nice. And my buddy had the Kalyan pork with lau lau. Very well done flavourful. Quality food. Nice interior for as small as the place is it was inviting."}
{"text":"I like this place better than Aloha Kitchen.  The portions are more \"true to size\" for local Hawaiian food.  The only other closer place that serves the right portion is \"Island Flavor\".

I've been here twice: Once with my boyfriend (He got hamburger steak and I got katsu saimin) and another time to eat chicken katsu curry.  Both times we got our food quicker than you can say \"try pass the shoyu, brah\".  I loved the saimin and it reminded me of home, for serious.  My boyfriend loved the hamburger steak because it came with lots of gravy.  The second time I came and got the katsu curry it came with THREE pieces of katsu, usually I get only one (Aloha Kitchen!).  The down side was that the curry sauce was like L&L curry sauce and I think that kine is gross.  Katsu curry should be full on curry all over everything not that Hawaiian curry in a small little sauce container, but I can't complain about the portion and I still ate it all.  Still, the edge goes to Island Flavor....if only it wasn't across town for me."}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop for some Hawaiian BBQ. Been getting BBQ short ribs with a Hawaiian Sun drink (the pink one) for years. The spam musubi is also a good choice for quick nom.

It's similar in my opinion to L&L or vice versa when it comes to menu choices. But I do feel Ohana makes the food better. Possibly I'm bias since they've been keeping me fed for a while.

I would say this location has a very nice inside to eat at. Sometimes I feel Hawaiian BBQ places have bare minimum when it comes to inside dinning."}
{"text":"I originally was thinking about having pho for lunch. That idea was nixed when I realized that I had planned on having ramen for dinner. I didn't want noodles twice in one day. I was going into Churches Fried Chicken to get my daughters lunch when I spotted Ohanas. I ordered BBQ Salmon Bowl and a soda at the counter. The cashier told me my meal would be delivered to my table. When my food arrived I thought... Oh boy another meal eaten off Styrofoam with plastic utensils. The fish was cooked good enough, the side vegetables were plenty. That means that some broccoli went uneaten. My only complaint would be that it could have had some more teriyaki glaze poured over the bowl. I left there somewhat full, satisfied enough I suppose. I could see returning here to try something else another time."}
{"text":"I use to live 2 blocks from this place and I would eat here at least once a week I LOVE this place!

I usually ordered the Chicken Katsu full order, OMG the chicken is tender and juicy and the breading is just right but what really got me was the sauce mmm mmm good so sweet and delicious. Sometimes I would order the combo plate half BBQ Beef and half Short Ribs which came with two huge scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The rice is nice and fluffy and the macaroni salad is sooo sweet and yummy. 

The food is high quality and the portions are sooo generous you can actually split a plate with someone and still be full that's how generous there portions are. 

Also the staff is very friendly and service is fast they always had my order ready for pick up when I got there."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  The to-go styrofoam containers even when you're dining in.

LIKE  The Kalua Pig & Cabbage. The food selection. The combo plates. The slightly generous portions.

LOVE  The cashiers who remember my regular order."}
{"text":"All the food here is always delicious, I recommend u try it all the BBQ Beef, chicken, katsu, salmon, it's all good eating.  I usually do 2 mac and 1 rice on the sides, mac salad is so good.  Can't go wrong with any of the BBQ platters.  They also have a chinese menu, its hit and miss 2.5 out of 5.  Spam musubi and crab rangoon are great, everything's fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here at least 5 times and each time they've never disappointed. The owners are extremely nice and the staff are accommodating. Their Mongolian Beef and Beef Short Ribs are a must have!"}
{"text":"Fire  love coming here when looking for a loco moco n a musubi   Katsu chicken n Mac salad. Best"}
{"text":"We tried this new location at Rainbow yesterday. Our first time actually. I think the food we ordered was great!  The serving was generous. I ordered chicken katsu, bbq mix, liempo steamed bun I think they call it PK Steamed Bun. All three were delicious. The meat was very tender and juicy.. Jazmine, the lady  at the counter was very polite and friendly  when she took our orders. We'll definitely go back for another lunch or dinner to try their seafood combo and other delicious looking food on their menu."}
{"text":"Best won ton mein since moving here, 4 years ago.  I will be back to try something else in the future."}
{"text":"Have never eaten here and NEVER will after what happened tonight! I don't care how good the food is. I called in around 947pm asking if I can place a Togo order I know they are about to close but some places like ISLAND FLAVOR will put an order in until they actually close! I call the store a lady with a heavy Asian accent picks up I ask her if I can order and then she says we don't take orders after 945 pm and then just hangs up in my face! Are you serious?! I understand that I can't place an order but don't just hang up in my face. I called back asking for her name in manager she refused to give me the information saying she was sorry she was counting money and was busy she finally said her name was Reeney or at least that's how it was pronounced. The worst customer service ever! Like who does that"}
{"text":"Hawaiian barbecue great food great customer service.
Every time we call them The food is ready to go in they always do exactly what I want with the food order. 
If you live on the south west Las Vegas area I commanded you to go to them if you look for Hawaiian barbecue.
Again Great customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were here on a previous visit and were very satisfied with Hawaiian BBQ combos.  We happened to be in the area and planned to have the same but decided to try their expanded menu, which included a variety of Japanese and Vietnamese noodle soups.  We tried the Japanese Tonkontatsu noodle soup, Vietnamese noodle bowl and crispy noodle chicken entr√©e. The food and service was excellent. Will definitely be back again if in the area."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. I always come here when I''m in town. I'm from New England so we don't have an authentic Hawaiian food. This place is golden. I always get their chicken katsu and their pineapple crab rangoons and always have leftovers. The staff is super nice and friendly. Not much seating.

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite Hawaiian restaurant in town! Me and my boyfriend are frequents here and the older lady that runs the cash register is always nice and very genuine even when it's super busy! I always get the chicken katsu (five stars) and my boyfriend gets the BBC beef (also five stars) an extra plus they have cheap Thai tea with Boba!"}
{"text":"I love their food. And we've tried the noodles like their Ramen. If you don't want to drive all the way to spring mtn for Ramen, this is the best place to go. I love their Hawaiian food, and also their chinese food. They have almost everything; they even have Pho which is awesome that I don't need to go to Rainbow or Spring Mtn. I'm just lucky it's just 2 minutes away from me. Favorites: Mongolian Beef, Wonton Noodle, Spam Musubi, Loco Moco Plate, Pineapple Crab Rangoon, singaporean noodle, Ramen, and their fried rice."}
{"text":"Came to get some chicken katsu. Saw the cooks use no gloves, put the raw chicken on the cutting board and then put the cooked chicken on the same cutting board. They tried to give it to me. Told the owner if he was trying to get people sick. So I gave it back to them and left. Health department will have fun with this one"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to place when I need my chicken katsu or BBQ chicken musubi fix. 

The place is a bit small and can be really crammed during their busy hours. Aside from that, they have a big selection of food and also offer boba milk tea or thai tea as well as Hawaiian sun drinks. 

I usually order the chicken katsu with gravy or sometimes with curry depending on my mood. I can never go wrong with gravy! The chicken is always very crispy and whether you order the mini or regular, you're getting a lot of food. As for the curry, it's usually a hit or miss. It's not the best sometimes but I really love their chicken katsu so I can eat that by itself. I also am not too fond of the macaroni salad that comes with each dish but you can replace it with more rice. 

The BBQ chicken musubi is my new favorite musubi! Ever since my mother-in-law brought some home for us, I really can't go back to spam musubi (unless it's the only option of course). 2 can make me full so the portion is a decent size and it's perfectly wrapped. 

Overall, the staff is also always friendly and they are usually fast when it comes to service. I always find myself here with my friends when we can't decide what to eat. You get your money's worth here since portions are so big!"}
{"text":"Very Busy location. Great food. I got the Kalbi (short rib) plate for my husband. It was a lot of food and he said it tasted great. It took awhile to make, but it is made freshly, so well worth the wait. Food was really ono (good)!!!!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian Food is so good and yet so cheap. It feels wrong.

So it's a little sit down in a strip-mall. At least it's a nice strip mall in a great part of Henderson. Parking's a little shoddy, but if you're willing to walk it's fine. The shop itself is totally clean and provides a variety of polynesian delights.

And delights they are. The barbecue here is amazing, especially for the prices. The fact that you can get like a small cow, or a medium sized pig, in a styrofoam container with rice and pasta for less than 10 bucks is nuts. It's nuts. And it's so damn good.

Thai and Boba teas also in full effect and spectacular. Service was great too. I accidentally dropped my drink on the floor. Girl behind the counter was cleaning it up before you could say \"Stupid Haole.\" Everything is so great here I assume that the food is in fact terrible for you just to keep the universe in balance. 

And the Loco Moko is enough to make my white ass want to secede from the US. This is a really good Hawaiian chain. 

Huge Occasional Con: If someone orders the shrimp they serve them virtually in tact (they might devein them. Might) and the whole place smells like an eight hundred pound person died in the back last week and they can't figure out how to get them out. I've only had this happen once in 10+ visits.

I really should be giving this place five stars, but I suspect it's killing me at a pace McDonalds can only dream about. Worth it though."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here, helps me get my Hawaiian BBQ Plate Lunch fix. Once in a while our schedule is overloaded that cooking at home is just not an option and some days we just feel like having some Hawaiian BBQ or quick Asian food. This place has both!

My children enjoy their Beef Short Rib \"Kalbi\" plate and I enjoy their Curry Shrimp plate. Sometimes, we would get the Salt & Pepper Calamari, Beef Chow Funn or Salt & Pepper Pork Chops.

We've been getting food here for a past few years, maybe once or twice a month, but I  must say their food quality, taste and portion has always been consistent, which is very important!"}
{"text":"I knew something tasted funny when I ate here I forgot to write a review but I got food poisoning from the Kalbi in December just be careful what u order here I definitely will  ever go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great just don't like that they charge 50cents more if u use your debit card under $10 purchase. That is not a selling point by doing that only drives people away from coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Spam Saimin.  I asked if I could add vegetables and egg and yes they do add it for. 75 cents each.  Night is a bit chilly and I'm a bit under the weather so this hit the spot.  I would rather my egg be hardboiled but it was delicious none the less. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Huge portions at great prices. The food is amazing. This is one of our favorite take-out places. Portions are large enough for two meals and are very tasty."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Hawaiian BBQ spot in the neighborhood...and there are plenty! Never had a bad experience here. I think the teri sauce and meat marinade makes all the difference when you're talking Hawaiian BBQ grindz, and Ohana's formula is just right.

Service is always fast and served with aloha. I even placed a same-day catering order for my housewarming, and it was perfect and ready right on time. All of my guests loved it.

I'm a little confused as to why they're offering a chinese-ish menu too, but hey...I guess get more where you can get more. Never tried any of it though.

Skip the malasadas. Totally not anywhere close to Leonard's quality...Bring cash if you're placing a small order. $10 minimum for cards."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place and having never tried that style of bbq it sounded like it would be interesting.  Wow- was it tasty !   My husband had assorted bbq platter and I had one of the beef noodle dishes.  People were friendly and provided great service.  Very clean.  This was a sit down restaurant that served as fast as some fast food.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"Ohana is great. I love their chicken katsu with curry. Their Loco Moco is great as well. Super friendly and never have to wait a long time."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Hawaiian bbq. The staff is always nice, and the food is always so so satisfying. I usually get the garlic shrimp or salmon bbq, and they're both delicious. My boyfriend usually gets the katsu, and the portions are large even for him. The musubi is always made with a thick cut of spam, and the malasadas are heaven. 

This isn't the closest place to me, but I drive here regardless because I love it that much."}
{"text":"This spot reminded me of L&L Hawaiian BBQ in Colorado, which is basically the only other time I've had Hawaiian food. However, they serve a wide variety of foods including hamburgers and select Chinese dishes. 

I ordered the short ribs plate. The meat was cooked fine and it's served with two scoops of macaroni salad and rice if you order the large. I also has the spam musubi--which had a tiny bit too much rice IMHO. A friend ordered the katsu musubi and it looked like a dream. 

Great choice if you're craving Hawaiian or want to try it out for the first time! All of my friends were satisfied with their food!"}
{"text":"Took my family here for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed.  The place is very clean and inviting.  We ordered chicken wings, short ribs, Singapore-style noodle, wonton noodle soup and seafood pan-fry noodle.  Excellent food quality especially their noodles which are made locally.  Our party had a very good dining experience and have dined here twice in three days during our vacay here.  Will definitely come back when in Vegas.  Definitely will recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I liked it here! I loved the prices even more. It is a cute small place and the people are so friendly. Food is good and service is quick! If you want  good Hawaiian food for great price you'll like it here!"}
{"text":"Normally enjoy the food from here. Today's take out order was a real let down. Had ordered a couple mixed plates that had the Kalbi and seafood. Guess what. When I got to work there was no tartar sauce. We tried eating the seafood without it and it was nasty and dry that way so it ended up in the garbage. I guess I will travel further to go back to the blue diamond location which was
Always a 5 star location."}
{"text":"Ohana's Hawaiian Bbq is probably one of the best hawaiian chain food places in Vegas, definitely recommend coming here!! The BBQ mix plate is amazing. I come here so much with my boyfriend and we both enjoy it so so much!"}
{"text":"Finally a location closest to home! I love their food! From authentic Hawaiian local food to traditional Chinese food! Reminds me of home food back in Hawaii! I love it here always have a positive attitude and the environment is family chill! Cashiers are very friendly! Beats L&L quality!"}
{"text":"Like this place better than L and L bbq. Always enjoy the Thai tea with boba! Staff at the front counter was very nice and helpful as well! Not a big fan of the Kalua pork, although it is better than the pork I got at Paradise Cove in Hawaii. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Mmm short ribs and Chicken Katsu... BOMB!!!! Amazing food amazing price, and such a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I will not be able to give a rating.  I placed an online order at 7:30 pm for delivery.  I was called at 8:21 pm and told that the delivery would be another 45 min to an 1 hour.  I asked why and was told she was not sure the drivers are taking a long time.  She stated that she had one driver that left an hour ago and had not returned. (I hope they are alright)  Needless to say I had to cancel my order.  Pity, because I was looking to try them.  I guess it is back to Aloha for me."}
{"text":"Zack (my son) let me try some of their chicken Katsu with their sweet dipping sauce a week ago & I'd been craving it ever since...so today we grabbed some for dinner  & it was just as great!! So much for $6.50 (with mac & rice)...I made a dent & Grandma finished it up!! Will be returning soon!! Yummmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, food is alright for Hawaiian local food, but old Asian lady gotta not run register...lmao! And seem like haoles only get served faster..."}
{"text":"Yummy food, Beautiful ambiance, and super nice/friendly staff. Rocky was the best and Tracy was awesome. Good value for the price and quality is great. Fast food price for restaurant experience. I've gone there twice now and will keep going back."}
{"text":"Ok. I am no way a Hawaiian BBQ expert.....but my wife and I ate here last night and it was superb! We got the Chicken Katsu (came with a lot of chicken, BBQ dipping sauce, Macaroni Salad and some awesome sticky rice) and it was delicious. Priced right and a nice portion size. Much, much better than L&L BBQ. Definately will visit here again, try some other menu items......or maybe just get the Katsu again!"}
{"text":"As a lady, I can eat a lot.  Sometimes people term me as a savage when it comes to food, so I have been working on taming down a bit when I am eating to work on my mannerisms when it comes to food.  When I say I can eat a lot, I mean it.  But the mini portions here at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ are sufficient enough for lunch.  I did have a Spam musubi on the side as well.  

I chose to try the mini portion or half size if you will, of the loco moco which comes with a scoop of rice, and a scoop of macaroni.  The macaroni is nothing special, but it tasted good like any other Hawaiian BBQ joint.  The loco moco though was super flavorful, and the egg on top (cooked any way you like) topped it off.  Well of course there was the gravy too.  It was good food and tasted homemade.  I was full and fell into a food coma as I drove back to work.  I was sleepy when i got to my desk!  

The spam musubi was good too!  I am glad I found this joint because it is a short drive from my work place!  I will come back to try more stuff again!  I might have to update my review to 5 stars once I find out more about this place.  But so far so good!"}
{"text":"The BBQ was great. Often the Hawaiian fast food places serve chicken that's way too fatty but this place was GREAT. Nice flavor, cooked just right, and I didn't have to trim away excess fat. I sure hope that's the norm because we'll try it again."}
{"text":"Typical Hawaiian plate lunch, and a menu of Chinese favorites. Probably helpful when the lunch crew can't decide what to have. Hmm.. squid or spam, how to decide. We stuck with Hawaiian, skipped the spam, and still had a nice lunch. Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm on a Hawaiian food kick (I miss home) so I figure I'll keep it rollin'.

All I can say is...if you wanna try this place, go on a Sunday.  Yep, a Sunday because they usually have 3 specials going on!  Their current specials are regular plates of Chicken Katsu or BBQ Chicken for $5.25 (or $5.50 can't recall), and BBQ Salmon for $5.95.  It's all good for Hawaiian fast food!  Each regular plate comes with (of course) 2 scoops of white rice (yay Calrose) and 1 scoop of macaroni salad (in Hawaii that's considered your 'veggie').  They don't skimp either!  Chicken Katsu comes with about 3 big rows of chicken, and the BBQ chicken comes with about 3-4 large marinated charbroiled thighs.  More than enough food to share between 2 people...or one BIG KANAKA!  Food quality is good, dishes are ONO!  Almost as good as back home in Hawaii.

This Ohana BBQ is much cleaner and nicer than the one on Durango.  The people are more pleasant at this location too.  Menu is considered typical Hawaiian take-out (but sure, they have tables for eating in)...everything is packed in styrofoam containers whether you eat in the restaurant or not.  Their plate lunches have a great variation with lots of pork, beef, seafood, and chicken dishes to choose from.  Favorites such as Kalua Pig, Lau Lau, Loco Moco, Kalbi Shortribs, Mahi Mahi, and Chicken Katsu Curry are all on the menu.  Even better is the pricing...all regular plate lunches are no more than $9, most between the $6-$8 range.  And all da food is edible!  ONO!  Go figah!  Kalbi not as good as my Mom's but that's another story.  Pretty close to authentic Hawaiian fast food...so I won't knock on the Chinese guy (really from China...guy don't know English or Pidgin) that is cooking in the back.  You keep cookin' without that wok Bruddah!

Besides plate lunches you also have burgers and sandwiches, such as a cheeseburger or Mahi Mahi sandwich.  You can combo these up with fries and a drink for under $6.  They also do other Hawaii specialties like Saimin and Spam Musubi (everyone's favorite!), and even Malasadas too!  This location also serves boba drinks on the cheap and Hawaiian Sun drinks as well.  So you Hawaii transplants can stock up lil' bit on the Hawaii goodies if you need to at the last minute. 

Solid 4 stars for me here, not quite as good as home...but miles better than the L&L's we have here in Las Vegas.  The decor is a bit kitchy (stuff you wouldn't see in an actual Hawaii joint) but I'm not gonna take off points for that.  The food is where it matters most.  Not too much frills, but this place will fill your tummy up good.  And the owners next door of the Quizno's?  They from Maui!  No joke!  They eat at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ all the time.  Mmm Mmm Mmm...toasty!"}
{"text":"I discovered this Hawaiian joint in the Target shopping center while exploring the other side of Blue Diamond Rd going west away from the strip. Your typical \"Hawaiian lunch plate\". On their menu they got da kine like the Kalua pork, manpuas, spam musubi, moco loco plate, teriyaki, malasadas. They even got Thai Iced Tea and boba drinks. One cool thing that they have is a daily lunch special that's about $5. I tried my friend's teriyaki salmon and it was quite \"onolicious\"-- cooked and seasoned quite well. I got a mixed chicken and beef teriyaki plate. The mac salad and the beef was bomb. The chicken however was a bit dry and not so flavorful. The portions were generous. I look forward to going back and trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this spot. They have a great selection of food, their food is really flavorful and not loaded with MSG, and their employees are all very kind. 

I've ordered everything from their bbq glazed chicken soup, which is excellent, to their combo fried rice. I'm not the biggest fan of the beef served in the rice, but it's sill excellent. Their shrimp with stir fried veggies is probably my top choice and their portion sizes are great!"}
{"text":"Newest location on the southwest side! Located on rainbow and windmill. This location is wayyy bigger than the other nearby ones and pretty nice inside for a fast food Hawaiian place. Speaking of Hawaiian food, you can get great, tasty Hawaiian food here for a super reasonable price. Even the \"mini\" plates are a generous portion. It includes all the classic Hawaiian plates (loco moco, Katsu chicken, spam musubi, etc), and they even have malasadas available for purchase! Some tips, call ahead and order. Takes about 10-15 minutes for your food to come out. Don't care for the Mac on the side (which all orders come with), they are willing to replace the Mac with another scoop of rice instead!! Easy parking available right outside"}
{"text":"Customer service is great every time. The 1st time I ordered pot stickers and they came out cold. The cooks looked at me in confusion when I told them. 2nd time was better"}
{"text":"I walked in the lady was ok. I asked for a calorie count she said they don't have one. I didn't end up eating there. As I walked to the side I realized a mop near the grill. Gross they have an A. The health inspector must have shown up on a good day."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and delicious. My favorite is the peeled garlic shrimp they're soooo bomb I can't help myself I always order them. I love how you can get full order or mini order which is actually more than enough food for one meal. The prices are right and they're always really friendly I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ordered: BBQ Beef and Chicken Bowl, double scoop of Mac salad

Service was nice and friendly. Food was your typical Hawaiian style food. It's noticeable that the food was not as commercialized, but more homey. Though nothing out of the ordinary. Bf said he prefers L&L's more. The BBQ bowls were both pretty salty, the Mac salad was creamy and had a good consistency."}
{"text":"It's been almost 2 years since I last eaten Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  The last time I was here, I got their Salmon with rice which I thought was one of the best Salmons one can get, especially at a Hawaiian restaurant.  On my most recent visit, I opted for their Katsu Mini and a Katsu Masubi.  I really wanted a Loco Moco, but cut off red meat for Lent. First of all, let's talk price and portions.  Price is probably one of the cheapest out there and the portions are huge.  My Katsu Mini looked as big as a regular.  My only issue is that it was missing some taste.  From the rice, the macaroni, and to the Katsu, taste was lacking and it was super bland. My Katsu Masubi was also missing taste. If this restaurant was in SoCal, it may be considered really good stuff.  But with the amount of Hawaiian restaurants out here in Las Vegas, I would say Ohana is just okay.  

My co-worker had lunch with me.  He never eats anything outside of Pizza, Burgers, BBQ, etc.  In other words, he doesn't eat outside the box.  For the first time, I actually witnessed someone order a Cheeseburger at a Hawaiian restaurant. Hilarious stuff and he thought it was just okay, nothing special.  

On a side note, this restaurant also carries Chinese Food.  You can get what looks like Orange Chicken here and noodles.  Really??  Couple of things I do like about this restaurant is the details and pictures of their food. Almost every item that you can order has pictures represented. 

Overall, I really don't see myself driving out of my way to come here. The location is far from the usual areas I'm in anyway.  However, I still remember how good their Salmon was.  Maybe my next trip is just for that."}
{"text":"the moment i took a bite off the chicken katsu i could not help but write a review... wow this is amazing the mac salad is amazing too"}
{"text":"Their macaroni salad is good! I am a fan of the bbq chicken with sticky rice."}
{"text":"I come to this location very often. I've tried almost everything and it all tastes great! You can never go wrong!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Hawaiian food restaurants in the valley!

The portions to price is just right. I'm 5'9\" and 165lbs and a mini order of BBQ chicken doesn't leave me hungry.

BBQ Chicken - Wonderful deep rich flavor, so you can tell they marinade for a good amount of time.

Katsu Chicken - Excellent crunch, the Japanese wife gave a big thumbs up!

BBQ Salmon - For $8 you can get to big pieces of salmon cooked much, much better than most of the restaurants in Vegas. The wife usually ops for the $5 bowl and she was also super happy with the sandwich.

Curry Shrimp - The curry could be spicier, but everything else is nice. Their curry is more a Chinese style curry (from my experience with curries).

Fried Shrimp - OK, this is where I had a problem. Their shrimp is the over butterflied cut with way too much batter. Reminded me of the frozen precooked you can buy at the supermarket.

Mahi Mahi - I just don't like how they prepare it and I can't really explain why, all I know is that I prefer the mahi mahi at Ross J's.

Musubi: Spam or BBQ Chicken with steamed rice wrap in nori. Can't go wrong there!

Want a taste of everything? They have combo plates just in case you are having an internal struggle!

I highly recommend checking this place out! Worried about rice ruining your diet? No problem, they offer a mixed vegetable substitution."}
{"text":"What can I say, the food is so delicious! In my week of vacation, I've gone here four times. Had the BBQ mix combo, the kalua pork, the pork lau lau, the pineapple chicken chicken katsu curry, Hawaiian BBQ short ribs, malasadas, and the Hawaiian green tea. So so good!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian hands down with the friendliest staff. I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Gosh I love this place. The mac salad is delicious, the rice is always perfect, and my hubbs requests their bbq chicken weekly. The staff is friendly, the food is always hot and delicious, and they are quick about it!! A+ in our book!!

Note, the restaurant is small and hot (temperature), you might want to consider taking it to go."}
{"text":"I eat in the restaurant side when I come here and the service is consistently friendly! It definitely has the Hawaiian kindness happening! I like the plate lunches and the saimin! A quick and delicious lunch or dinner place!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE & love the staff. I come here daily for my Thai tea fix. The variety of the menu is great as well."}
{"text":"Went in at 9:00 with my family was going to have dinner there and they told me I can't eat in the restaurant and they are only doing to go. That's pure laziness that they won't let us eat in there restaurant when it says open until 9:30!!! You guys are a restaurant and should serve people in you're restaurant until 9:30pm!!! Bad customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I love Ohana! When I am on a show run I eat here 2-3 times a week. The BBQ chicken is BOMB, always like the pork Lua Lua or Kalua pork (sometimes a bit salty, but it's really good). I always get 2 Mac balls and 1 rice. The portions are heafty for the price, which makes me a fat n happy man. Have gotten the musubi a few times, it's good but a bit dry as others have stated. 
I have recently tried L&L just for comparison, and Ohana gets my vote and my business! Great job Ohana team! Thank you for making scrumptious food when I don't have time to make it myself!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Ohana Hawaiian.  The chicken katsu I think is better than L&L.  The chicken was excellent and they give you plenty of sauce for dipping.  The rice was perfectly cooked and the macaroni salad was very good.  The serving size was much larger than expected.  You won't leave hungry. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and provided great service.  I thrilled I found this place! YUM!"}
{"text":"To me, katsu chicken is fried chicken done right. I don't really care for the fried chicken from most restaurants that specialize in such cuisine. But katsu is different. It is so supurbly crispy and tender. And the katsu I had at Ohana was phenominal. The sauce was good. It was not the normal American style BBQ sauce I get with katsu from other places.  It was more thin and tangy. Like a mustard and vinegar based sauce.  

I got a regular sized lunch plate of katsu with the customary two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. FYI, Hawaiian style macaroni salad is my favorite style. When I received my order I was shocked at how much katsu was in the box. I almost didn't need the side order of Spam musubi. I took much of my katsu and a scoop of rice home for dinner. I did eat the musubi and macaroni salad. In regards to the musubi, it was good. The nori wrap was tender and easy to bite through. The Spam was a normal sized serving. The rice was perfectly sticky. If there is just one complaint I have, there was not enough sauce. I like a lot of teriyaki on my musubi. 

This place was good. I am glad I stopped in. I am sorry to see it so far away from me though."}
{"text":"Just saw this place and tried it. I'm happy I did! Did was great! Cafe style seating. Right side is Hawaiian food. Left side is more Chinese style selection with yummy noodle dishes I have to come back and try. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome very friendly... Besides the Pineapple Chicken being horrible i love the Mac salad and the Katsu Chicken was yum, and the Chai Tea with BOBa.  YUM!!!   Im giving it a 3 star because Island Flavors and Aloha Kitchen right down the road is a little better but also a little more expensive."}
{"text":"The chicken rice dish was good. Chicken marinated just right. Unfortunately the Wait time is very long for only 3 people in the entire restaurant. They promoted checkin to receive free appetizer.... they set the minimum purchase of $20. Deceiving if u ask me since majority of lunch items are average price of $8. Needless to say i didnt get to try it to comment but poor business practice."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for over 8 years and I absolutely love it. The food is amazing...even more importantly, the customer service is excellent. Every time I walk in, they make me feel like their Ohana. For the last 8 years I have seen predominantly the same employees. My favorite person is king. She's such a sweetheart and always remembers my name when I come in. I love it there and I always recommend it to people who are looking for authentic, fresh Hawaiian food. I usually reccommend the spam masubi, but I've gotten to try a lot of other items. I also recommend their burger meal. The fries are always fresh when I order them. 

Definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Had the Katsu Chicken as well as a few Musubis and I was definitely SATISFIED!!!
Love how clean it is inside as well. Rainbow Blvd has so many gray spots popping up and this is definitely one of them!!!"}
{"text":"Thai Iced Tea.... Yummers! & Prices are reasonable!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend ! Had the chicken Katsu and it was nothing to look forward to. Sauce was there own like a sweet chili sauce that you would use for egg rolls . They had no idea what a Hawaiian chicken katsu was about. I hate these people that would represent  Hawaiian food but really don't know what that is. Secondly I ate in and my food was ready for me but they didn't care to give to me only interested in taking orders. Chinese own if you care."}
{"text":"Really good. Never disappoint. One of favorite restaurants in Vegas. It make me start to interested in Hawaii food. Thank you. Please keep good."}
{"text":"Our first time at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ and it's a hit!  Ventured to this restaurant after shopping at Kohl's on Blue Diamond Road.  My family and I ordered the following:
- Spam Misubi - pretty good - an oblong \"roll\" with a layer of rice and a thick cut of spam wrapped with nori and then fried on all sides.  It has a sweet sauce in between the rice and spam.
- Fried Shrimp Saimin, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Saimin and Spam Saimin - 3 variations of saimin and quite delicious and very cheap!
- Pork Lau Lau & Kalua Combo - a little pricey but oh so good!  It comes with Kalua pork like smoked pulled pork cooked with shredded pieces of cabbage.  Pork Lau Lau is the best thing Hawaiian thing I've ever eaten!  The pork is wrapped with taro leaves and then wrapped again with banana leaves and then steamed.  Delicious and tender.  Tastes really great with Siracha hot sauce.   We will be back for more Lau Lau!  The combo also comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad.  Big enough for 2-3 people.  Serious.  
- Soup Dumplings - 8 dumplings heated in a silver dim sum dish.  Comes with vinegar and thinly sliced ginger.

There are 2 sides to the restaurant - a dine-in side with wait staff and a fast food side where you go up and order the food.   We opted for the dine-in side.  The menu contains Hawaiian, Chinese, American, and Korean."}
{"text":"Never been to Hawaii, but want a taste of Hawaii?  Or really missing the Hawaiian BBQ flavors?  Ohana Hawaiian BBQ may just got your fixing.  Once you entered, you are welcome by a giant wall painting of old Hawaiian surfers, than you walk towards the order counter, and you are immediately overwhelmed by the variety of choices:  BBQ chicken, Kalbi, fried pork chop, fried calamari, saiman, musubi, Kailua pig, luau luau, burgers, loco moco, chow funn, spicy chicken, garlic shrimp.  Seriously, you name it, they got it.  Yes, Thai iced tea if you please.  That's what you call a melting pot!

A few of us went together, so we were able to sample a variety of items on the menu.

Fried calamari - Seasoned and fried perfectly.   My husband almost ate half the plate himself.

BBQ chicken - Marinated with sweet shoyu and the meat was very tender.

Garlic shrimp - Not your ordinary little shrimps.  This is the whole shrimp with shells, so you must suck on the shell to get all that garlic goodness.

Fried pork chop - Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender inside.  

Chow funn - Good and tasty.  Best of all, the noodles don't stick together like other restaurants.

House crispy noodle - This is a must try!  As you get a generous portion of stirred fried chicken and vegetables on top yummy crispy noodles.

We were heading to Hoover Dam afterwards, so we got Thai ice tea and spam musabi to go."}
{"text":"Better than L & L BBQ, the prices are good- $6.95 for regular sized plates- includes 2 scoops of white rice and mac salad (also has mini pacs). Drinks are: soda- free refills BTW, canned Hawaiian drinks, boba drinks, thai iced tea- 2 sizes- 16 oz./24 oz. Also has teriyaki bowls and gyoza on the menu. No haupia.  

You order at the counter, pay, and get your drinks. Select seating. The cashier (she was very nice BTW) will bring your food over to your table. If you are sharing, you can request disposable plates.

Entertainment coupon participant. We got three regular pacs (chicken katsu, kalua pork, and BBQ chicken), two thai iced tea's, and one drink for a little over $21.00, using the BOGO coupon. The three of us (my MIL) still had leftovers- which means big portions. Everything was very good. The chicken katsu featured white meat- nice surprise (L & L uses dark meat). The BBQ chicken had very little fat. The pork was seasoned just right. The thai iced tea was really good- I don't get it a lot so it's a real treat when I have it. We will definitely come here again.   

The decor was actually not what I thought it would be- very colorful and surprisingly very nice. There were 2 booths, the rest of the seating is tables and chairs,and  a couple bar tables- all are in brown and green (love those colors). Along the menu wall are giant hibiscus flowers- always reminds me of Hawaii. One side has a flat screen tv. It was clean and the cashier would clean the tables right away.    

There were many customers and lots of takeout orders- a very good sign. There are two other locations besides this one. Located in a strip mall, lots of shopping opportunities here- Kohls, Ross, Target, Dollar Tree. We spent four hours at this center once."}
{"text":"This one, located in a Wal-Mart neighborhood grocery strip mall (parking lot is busy), is smaller than the one at Blue Diamond Road, but the food quality is excellent plus you get a good view of the Diamondhead mural print on the wall- my hubby loves that print. Entertainment Book coupon participant BTW. 

Ok, it's funny, even though we were in Oahu recently, we like to get Hawaiian food soon after getting back- it's been a tradition of ours. We've been to the other one at Blue Diamond. We get the chicken katsu and BBQ chicken regular plates and split it. The plates come with two scoops of white rice, mac salad, and sauce. What we love about the katsu is the restaurant chain uses white meat- much better than L & L. One piece of the BBQ chicken was slightly undercooked (pink), and the chef was so cool about it- he cooked a fresh piece for us. We rarely finish our food- we always have leftovers. Offers Hawaiian canned drinks like Pass-O-Guava. Wish they had haupia too. 

It's clean, the staff is very nice (very friendly), and the food is great tasting, quick and reasonable. There are several tvs mounted up high, for your viewing pleasure. The wall near the doors has a small bulletin board where business cards are pegged- not many up there. The special is a teriyaki salmon bowl for $6.50- but the sign for it is located on the opposing wall on the far right (from the menu above the counter). 

If we are on this side of town, we'll gladly come here for lunch again."}
{"text":"Ohana has a lot of great stuff, its close to my house so i come here whenever i dont want to cook. I love their tonkatsu ramen, i always order it with spinach noodles to make it a little bit healthier :) i love the spam musubi!! Ive also tried their curry, but it wasnt really that great. Order thai iced tea with bobba, super yummy!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and tried to share the BBQ Mix Combo and EVERYTHING was extremely over salted. We couldn't even finish it. And all of their sauces (teriyaki and sweet and sour) were very watered down. Would not recommend. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch special.  Great environment.  Music isn't too loud, floors are clean. Food was fantastic.  Their hoisin sauce was boss combined with Sriracha.  Service was great too!  

I had the Hawaiian pulled pork mini and the portion was perfect for lunch!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good. My husband is from Hawaii and when we come here, which is maybe 1x/month, he always says how good it all is. Their menu selection is big. Their chicken wings may take a while...but soooo worth it! Chicken Katsu is crispy and juicy...Saimin is so good! Dining style has either walk-up order and take-out or sit at a table, or they have a separate side for actual dine-in and order at table. Decent amount of food, too, for their prices. they are very worth it!"}
{"text":"leave the chinese food to chinese restaurants.  the quality has gone down a LOT since the addition of chinese plates"}
{"text":"So I've been wanting to come here for a while, & i finally had some time to try it out today since my nail shop is right next door. I go for the regular bbq chicken plate & I asked if I could get fried rice instead of regular. The lady taking my order said it would be 2.00 extra. So I agreed. I took my order to go since I live not even 2 min away. When I get home, I have loads of chicken and rice, but no mac salad? I call & tell her, & she tells me \"when you get fried rice, it no longer comes with Mac salad\" I understand, but she didn't tell me when my order was being taken. No biggie I guess since some people on here are saying it's bland. I just was looking for that cold refreshing taste with the chicken. That irritated me a little, but whatevs.

Anyway, bbq chicken is tender, juicy, and they do not skimp! Fried rice was plentiful as well. I paid 11.00 & I have soo much left over!! So I would say it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out. There was plenty of meat in the Hawaiian barbecue box, enough for two. But my LocoMoco lacked flavor and the Musubi had so much rice you could barely taste the spam. There was no flavoring sprinkled onto the rice, either. Yes, the food is cheap, but the quality is, too."}
{"text":"They never seem to disappoint when I'm lazy to cook dinner. My usual would always be combination pan fried noodles, salt n pepper pork chop, and salt n pepper calamari. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love the curry dishes and highly recommend them.  I like the flavor and spice used in the curry more than curries from cuisines such as Indian, Thai, Chinese, etc."}
{"text":"Food is great! You get a lot of food for a decent price. Pineapple chicken is awesome. The only reason why I wouldn't give it more stars is because it is kinda small. Especially when it's lunch time, it's packed and you have to wait for a table. Maybe they need more cooks because it take awhile to get your food."}
{"text":"Good Noodle Soup (Saimin) go very well with BBQ Beef  and BBQ combo (especially chicken) a big portion ,it worth your money. Try their Gyoza very fresh and soft skin...my sis and I live in D.C. ,we go visit Las Vegas last couple week . Our first time there on last couple Wednesday...the lady staff over there ,she was very nice...good food and good hospitality made us went back there again....(unfortunately have not enough chance to try everything on the menu)"}
{"text":"Had the BBQ mixed combo plate. You get a lot of food for the money. It tasted pretty good too. I want to try the spam masubi next time i eat there. it looked good!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian and Chinese food!  We used to live across the street and would eat here several times a week but we moved a little further away but we still come here when we want yummy food and friendly service.  We've made the mistake of eating Hawaiian food closer to our house and regretted eating there.  Thanks for the delicious food and friendly service service!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon BBQ. It was very tender and marinated perfectly. Some of the better BBQ that I've had. Garlic shrimp was very flavorful without being overly saturated with oil and fat. 

Was surprised that the food felt generally healthy. I didn't have to be rolled out of the place."}
{"text":"I love to order the garlic shrimp and rice especially the masubis!! There price is reasonable and quality is great! Their service is fast too! I always order pick up on my lunch and they always have it ready by the time I get there! They are always polite to me too!! I pick this over L&L and Aloha Kitchen any day!!"}
{"text":"My tummy hurts  :(

We ordered using the online for for take-out, which was super convenient since I hate ordering food over the phone. So anytime I can order online, I love it.

However, my problem came after the initial ordering. We ordered as on the website -

Chicken Katsu - with macaroni, rice, with sauce on the site, on a bed of cabbage.

BBQ Combo Plate - with macaroni, no rice and no cabbage

Malasadas 


The Katsu came with Macaroni on the side, no cabbage and no sauce to be seen.

The BBQ plate came on a bed of cabbage.   

I don't mind that mine came on a bed of cabbage, and my boyfriends without, but the missing sauce was a big let down.


I had never had any of the BBQ items before (Ribs, BBQ Chicken and BBQ beef) and I really only enjoyed the beef, the ribs were ok, and I didn't know the BBQ chicken was all dark meat.

The Katsu was good like always, but could have used sauce ;)

Malasadas are always delicious, I just wish they came in half sizes.  There are two of us and we don't need 10 of them, 5 would be more than enough.

-
I have gotten the Salmon in the past and generally enjoy it, especially considering it's price! 
Next time I would order BBQ beef and Salmon combo. If I order it again.  It has been over a year since the last time I had Ohana (or any Hawaiian BBQ) and both my and my boyfriends' stomachs are killings us right now.
Not sure if it is too much grease or something just not agreeing with us."}
{"text":"My Hawaiian food spot, when ever Pure Aloha festival or Lei day isn't happening and I'm craving Hawaiian. This place hits the spot.

*What I usually Order*

Chicken Katsu: 4/5 The chicken is breaded tender and juicy. Their Katsu sauce is a lot different than most Hawaiian places I've gone to. I usually don't order chicken katsu because of how heavy some places drizzle the katsu sauce but this place finds a great balance. 

Short Ribs: 5/5 Even the mini is more than enough for me but when I want extra left overs I get the full size. The short ribs are cooked to perfection super soft and a bit chewy but it falls off the bone ever so easily. It comes with vegetables, rice, and macaroni salad. The whole dish comes together perfectly. 

Drinks: 4/5 Hawaiian Sun Passion Orange is soooooo good definitely a drink to top off delicious Hawaiian food. Very refreshing especially on a hot Vegas day. It's served in a can that they keep in a cool fridge & its super cheap I just wish there was more in a can lol

Service: 4/5 This is a hit or miss most of the employee's are really nice especially this young man which I think is the owner because I think this is a family owned business. Which makes it better, but when its busy depending on who you get they can seem a little snappy."}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre. Hard to mess up the foods we had, but they did."}
{"text":"Ohana is the only Hawaiian place I will eat at in the area. The place is clean, the workers are friendly and the price is fair.  There's even a big screen TV in there, which I watched the olympics on while eating a mini salmon teriyaki plate.  I recommend their salmon teriyaki, kalua pork, katsu and their kalbi.  Their portions are very generous.  I usually get a mini, which may sound small, but really it isn't.  Also, their macaroni salad is very good - not overly saturated with mayo like other places.  I've been back many times since my first time, and will be back for more."}
{"text":"This is a fast food restaurant connected to the Chinese seafood restaurant, Taste.  Both are excellent.  Here, had the loco moco.  Large portion with two patties and rice and eggs.  It was large, but very delicious.   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love that they are connected to the noodle shop. Great big selection. Love the pork soup dumplings and fried kau gee"}
{"text":"They get busy, but you can call ahead a phone order for pickup :) loco moco was bomb digity also had a bbq chicken plate soo far but do they offer half orders if you don't wanna be a complete fatty... thai ice tea  Staff had great customer service and helped me by opening the door when they didn't have to."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place - so much that we eat there often for lunch and dinner. And every Friday night, I order a half pan of noodles for my family dinner.  Thomas, the head cook, never forgets what my usual Friday order is.  The girls in the front are always friendly too.  We haven't had anything we don't like yet.  :)"}
{"text":"Super yummy and great service!! I ordered for pickup, and a little mishap occurred, but the staff handled it extremely well. Food was in good portions and price is reasonable. It's just a few doors down from my work, so i will definitely be back during my lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"This is the epitome of what a 5 star review should be. This place nailed it! Huge menu, huge portions, very clean restaurant, super friendly and personable staff, and great prices. Oh and it's a full service Asian place, which is almost impossible to find on the South side of Vegas. What more can I say, they knocked it out of the park for me. I will be back......"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't often write reviews on businesses because I've worked in the restaurant industry for a long time and understand the chaos it takes to work in one but I've never received such bad service in a long time. 

I placed an online order for 40 malasadas, which asks you for you credit card information as well as emails you a receipt. No where on the website or the email does it say to bring the credit card in. They do not charge the card via the Internet, they charge you when you come in. (Which may I add, if you're going to allow your customers to place online orders, you may want to mention this... When you send a receipt to someone; that's pretty much payment).

As soon as I walked into the business to tell them I placed an online order the hostess was already flustered because of other orders, completely understandable. As soon as I told her I didn't have the card because this was a business credit card for my work, I was placing an order for lunch, she got irritated with me and immediately  called her manager. When she tells me that it is fine and they will run the credit card with the information they have, she asks me to write down my contact information and my drivers license number. I simply
told her that I won't be giving her my drivers license number but I left my business card with her to contact me if there is an issue. Irritation comes across her face again and says \"that's what my manager said she needed! Fine, I'll just have her call you.\" There were many other ways to handle this situation, rudeness was not one I recommend. 

Simply put, I will no longer be bringing my business or the business of my company into this location. Apart from their incredibly rude customer service, I haven't even tried the malasadas but I have a terrible taste in my mouth by their rude of service."}
{"text":"I just freaking love this place! I haven't really tried other stuff other than BBQ chicken and fried shrimp but oh boy, I am in heaven whenever I have them! This is one of my comfort foods, and I never had a bad experience with their service. I travel 6 miles just for their food, even though there are much closer Hawaiian places to me, because no one so far is as delicious as what they have here :)"}
{"text":"Five stars for the AMAZING mac salad. I know what you are thinking, what the heck is wrong with this guy? Raving about MAC SALAD? Trust me, I've had a lot of Hawaiian food and this mac salad was one of the best i've had on the mainland. Maybe even better than I've had in my visits to Hawaii. The Kalua pig was just perfect, complete with soft cabbage and the right amount of delicious pork broth to mix with the perfectly cooked rice. I did get my boba tea order messed up a bit, but it was busy and there was only one girl responsible for taking orders, ringing people up, and making drinks. They redeemed themselves by having huge portions at a really decent price so I could have leftovers for two or three meals afterwards. Mahalo for reading:-)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and huge portions. There was a line out the door on a weeknight, so it must be good."}
{"text":"The Kalua Pork is off the charts!!  Best Hawaiian BBQ shop I have tried in Vegas (or anywhere for that matter).  I highly recommend this place for some great Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"Delicious every time - their staff is friendly and I never wait long for my food. I recommend the chicken katsu or bbq salmon - both very good! I like this place over L&L because it just seems much more fresh!!"}
{"text":"Before moving to Vegas I lived in Lahaina, Hawaii, so I have a pretty good idea of what Hawaiian food should taste like and this place hits the spot. Anything from pork lau lau to chicken katsu it's all good and never pricey. My favorite place in town."}
{"text":"Came here during our trip to Las Vegas since it was in the same plaza as Target. I was craving soup noodles so I tried the BBQ Chicken Saimin Noodles and my boyfriend got the Pork Laulau and Kalua plate. His plate was definitely better than mine and I stole some. The Saimin Noodles were very basic but it did fill me up. I loved the kalua with rice which was so hearty and delicious. I would come back here if I was in the mood for Hawaiian BBQ. It is connected to a pho fusion place so next time I will walk over to try their noodle soup.

The customer service was great and we were helped by two girls who were super helpful."}
{"text":"Super yummy, and good Prices! Staff was nice. Place was clean and modern. Will for sure go again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food and really good portions. Best macaroni salad! I always get the half/half combo. So much meat! Come here every week, helps satisfy Asian food cravings"}
{"text":"We normally go to the Ohana Bbq on Durango but we were in the area so we decided to try this one on Blue Diamond.

On the menu:
*Seafood combo w/ Bbq chicken
*Kalbi plate
*Mini chicken katsu

Total bill: $22.95 (good deal for ono food)

We love is some plate lunch stylw food because it reminds us of back home. 2 scoops rice, 1 scoop mac salad and your protein choice. Ono!
Everything looked as good as it taste and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I was really craving something quick but a little different. And short ribs came to mind so I thought I'd check this place out.  I'll definitely be coming back. The short ribs were meaty and juicy, very tender, perfectly cooked. The rice was good, and the macaroni was very tasty. I even wanted more, and I'm usually not a fan of this style of macaroni."}
{"text":"Several steps below your typical short-order Hawaiian Bbq joint. I haven't been here in a while and I had an itch for for Hawaiian food and surprisingly, they expanded the menu to included Chinese-American fare, too bad they missed the mark on both. 

The worst dish was the BBQ beef--very salty, rubbery, and greasy. They had a stir-fry of assorted vegetables that was an expensive letdown of salty, messy, and mushy broccoli, canned baby corn and mushrooms, zig-zag shaped carrots, and cabbage slathered in this salty, cum-cloudy, gelatinous sauce from Mars. Of course, the saving grace was the chicken katsu but I think that's hard to get wrong."}
{"text":"I am so F-ing grossed out right now! I ordered the pan fried noodles to go (before closing). While I was at home breaking the noodles I found strands of hair in my noodles, (which I wish I would of took a picture of it) embedded in my crispy noodles. So I tried to keep my cool and I chunked that plate of noodles in the trash... End of story! Right? How about NOT my second serving of noodles had another surprise... Can you guess??? I found some more strands of hair... WTF? WTF Was the cook doing combing her hair while cooking the noodles? I am so upset right now!!! My dinner is completely ruined! Thanks a lot Ohana for not following protocol and wearing a hair net while preparing paying customers food! 

UPDATE:  Thank you Austin for your comment, unfortunately I did not see your response.  Thanks but after careful examination and analyzing it was clearly Hair!  I do know the difference between bean sprouts and hair!  But thanks for trying to make the situation better, but I can no longer eat that dish due to the fact that I will always be reminded of the incident!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Everything I ordered was spot on.  Chicken Katsu, honey BBQ chicken wings, pho, and pan fried noodles. Would recommend if you are craving Chinese or Hawaiian."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Reminded me of another L&L or Ohana BBQ restaurant. The service could be better. Dont know if it was because it was near closing time and they got bombarded with orders. As I was waiting for my order to be cooked, i just watched and observed how the employees worked. They dont seem too organized when it comes to calling out orders for pickup. The employees ended up grumbling with each other because customer orders were getting messed up."}
{"text":"We were looking for some decent take out close to home.  This place is less than a block from our apartment and had good reviews so thought we'd give it a shot. Boy am I glad we did!  The food was delicious!  He got a seafood combo with friend rice and I got a combo with the chicken katsu and some BBQ beef with fried rice and macaroni salad. The sauce on the beef wasnt my cup of tea but other than that everything was outstanding. The sauce that came with the chicken was also really tasty.  This was my first time trying Hawaiian food but certainly won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Vegas! Must try. Has wide variety of choices. Everything we ordered is so good. Best service and food! Clean environment. So glad we stop by before heading home."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place in Henderson while we were looking for apartments. We originally drove into the plaza to grab some Jamba Juice, but we were both too hungry so we decided to stop into Ohana since it's right next door. 

Upon walking in, we were greeted by a really nice lady. She was talking to us like we've known her for years and made us feel right at home. 

Since the 'other' popular Hawaiian place in the valley hasn't been as awesome as we were used to it being, we were out to find another one that could be our regular spot and I'm happy to say, we may have found it!

We decided to share a pork katsu with rice and a side of mac salad with an order of spam musubi.

First of all, the portion was GIGANTIC. The pork katsu was flavorful and the breading wasn't falling off the meat and they give you DOUBLE the amount of what you would usually get at any other Hawaiian joint. They give you two scoops of mac salad (which was rich and wasn't bland like some other restaurants') instead of one measly one and even the rice portion is huge. We shared it, and still had leftovers! The spam musubi tasted freshly made and not made a few hours ago and stored somewhere. 

Only thing is, I wish they had a location closer to us. Probably a good thing that it's far though. For our waist line's sake anyway :D"}
{"text":"Interesting combo of both Chinese and Hawaiian food options available. The portions are large, but the service and quality are lacking. Checked in for the BOGO Boba, but they only offered thai tea and milk tea as options. 

Food came out in a timely manner we were a large group and all ordered separately. Milk tea was dropped off and I told them as more food was coming out, that we are missing a Thai tea. Took two different people to finally get the boba to the table. Then a third person came afterwards and asked if we got our Thai tea yet. Could use some better communication there.

Food wise, all their portions are extremely large and can probably be 1.5 - 2 meals. I got the Kalua Pork and it was alright. There was a lot of pork but the flavor wasn't there. Their mac salad is typical of most Hawaiian places. I sampled a bunch of other dishes from my friends. Their katsu was OK. It could use more seasoning, but dipping it in sauce solves a lot of things. Their chow fun / chow mein was actually pretty good and had a lot of flavor. 

Overall, wouldn't go out of my way to come here as there are a lot of other Hawaiian places that are better for roughly the same price point."}
{"text":"We're here at least 2x a week after a night at the gym.

Spam musubis for the kids. They can't get enough of it. 

Pan fried nooddle beef/shrimp combo perfect for the 4 of us and we also have some left overs. Really good especially for our area, than having to go to a Chinese resturaunt on Spring mountain. 

Garlic Shrimp noodle is good too, it changes due to the chef in the back but they never disappoint. 

And you can never go wrong with a Regular plate of Chicken Katsu. We either ask for Curry sauce, but last night we did the regular. 

Then last but not least, Thai tea w/ no boba and a water cup for \"WATER ONLY\". 

$38+ but if you work in the area, like I do next door, we get VIP discount and it brings it down to $33+ every time. 

For the amount of what they serve you for your Ohana and the price.  I say its just Right!"}
{"text":"I like this place I ordered the BBQ combo plate The food was really tasty and they give you a good amount of food  I got there  pretty late and still had a good amount of people in there and I have  always wanted to try this place They always have people inside  and looks pretty busy Definitely will be giving this a try again in the future The service is friendly and greets you with a smile !!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Hawaiian restaurant in Vegas, awesome food friendly employees specially (Kim) and it's really close to my place. Everybody needs to try they're BBQ salmon and the loco moco it's exceptional! And ofcourse the milk tea as well"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch around 1145 and ordered a BBQ mixed plate which was AMAZING! One plate feeds 2 1/2 people (2 adults and a toddler) lol. I forgot the actual name of the white buns but we'll just refer to them as manapua buns for now & those are soooo good! Put some BBQ chicken in them & you got yourself easy on the go lunch  before ordering our boba drink, we were told it would be a 40 minute wait because the boba wasn't ready yet. We agreed we'd wait cause we wanted to try their mango smoothie boba drink. We didn't get our drink until 1 hour later & when we did, it didn't even taste good. It tasted like a whip cream drink with swirls of mango here and there. There was little to no mango taste. This smoothie was not worth waiting 1 hour for. It only took us 20 minutes to finish eating & then the rest of the time we were just sitting there on our phones with a hyper 2 year old waiting for our boba drink. I wouldn't recommend the mango marble smoothie to anyone, hence the 4 star rating for this place. Other than that, customer service was great from when we walked in, to when we left. Food was fulfilling, & interior and exterior was clean and well maintained. Great place for those who are craving BBQ to eat."}
{"text":"Their food was delicious! We were treated to a special lunch from some long time customers of ours who had just found this place themselves. They enjoyed it so much they went out of their way to buy us lunch and bring it back to the shop. I can't say enough on how good it tasted! We will definitely be going back for more!! Sorry no pictures this time but only because there is nothing left to take a picture of but next time I will be posting some!"}
{"text":"Fresh made, not on a warmer bin.  Comes to hot and fresh.  Tastes great and well seasoned.  We usually order the BBQ combo plate which is hawaiian bbq, short ribs and chicken, walnut shrimp and chicken lo mean.  Good size servings and the three items above feeds four.  Fair prices for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Good hot food cooked to order so fresh and hot.  Located by Von's on Durango and Warm Springs.  The main Menu is the same mostly as the one on Eastern except the Eastern one has more selection of Chinese type food like lo mein.  The food is as good but we like the noodle dishes on Eastern.  Still recommend the BBQ mix or the ribs"}
{"text":"We love going to Ohana for lunch.  We go so often that the owners know who we are.  They always have some sort of special going on.  Currently, you can get a large plate of food for $4.95 (the selection depends on the day).  They are inexpensive, extremely quick, overly friendly, and their portions are huge!

My favorites include:
* Beef Curry
* Loco Moco
* Manapua
* Kahlua Pig & Cabbage
* Kahlua Pig & Cabbage / Pork Lau Lau combo
* BBQ Chicken or Beef Saimin
* Gravy Fries
* SPAM Musubi"}
{"text":"I am a teacher in the district and one of my class assignments for my 5th graders were to write letters to their favorite restaurants.  My student wrote to ohana Hawaiian BBQ and got an awesome response from them.  They kindly came to my class and provided the students with spam musubis, malasadas and Hawaiian sun drinks for lunch.  I am so thankful that they support our students and encourage them to practice their language arts and writing.  They also stayed and answered some questions about running a small business.  Thank you for your time and generosity.  I can't wait to try your noodles soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant, I usually end up going about once a week and the Kahlua Pork is phenomenal. Their macaroni salad is good, kind of bland but at least it isn't sweet! Of course, you can't forget the Musubi's, they are my absolute favorite! The staff is always very friendly and I'll continue visiting as often as I can."}
{"text":"Ehhh...about 2.5 to 3 star, totally mediocre overall.  It's great that they're open so late 7 days a week.  Portions are larger than average - the mini Chicken Katsu Curry can be 2 reasonable meals for me and would probably be one generous 'post-12 mile run' meal for my husband.  The curry has a semi-sweet Japanese curry flavor and was alright.  The katsu and macaroni salad are seriously bland, they could both use more flavor - not more salt but some actual spices in the dressing and breading. The katsu is white meat trimmed of fat, which is fine, but then you need something in there to flavor it up. The food seemed all fresh and the frying fat drained off, so nothing was soggy.

Malasadas were fine, drained okay, maybe a little bigger than average.  I would like to be able to make a half-order of those.  It was busy, but I did have to wait quite a while for my carryout order.  Eat24 was down for some reason, so I ordered when I got there."}
{"text":"Proper authentic asian flavours! Hands down best chow mein iv had since i moved from the UK, feels like a little taste of home."}
{"text":"Recently a hot and popular business named Coffee Hunter has opened in the southwest corner of Eastern and Warm Springs in the Walmart Neighborhood Market shopping center and is taking Las Vegas by storm. In its shadow is a hot and established  Hawaiian barbecue restaurant named Ohana Hawaiian Barbecue that has taken me by storm. The few times that I have spent time in the hot and popular Coffee Hunter was after filling up my appetite in Ohana Hawaiian Barbecue. 

     There is nothing fancy about Ohana Hawaiian Barbecue. It is similar to a nice Chinese take out restaurant with a few tables that serves large portions of delicious food. And, It is their large portion of the mini plate lunch barbecue chicken that I have consistently ordered with a fountain beverage. 

     In Hawaiian \"ohana\" means \"family.\" I have yet to feel like family. On the friendly scale, I'd give the employers a 3 out of 5. My main contact has been when I ordered and paid for the food at the counter. A few minutes later, the same employee would deliver my food and the napkin to my table that overlooked a picture of Hawaii. It is interesting that the restaurant goes all out on the food but scringe on the napkins. 

    The droll thing about the mini plate lunch is that it truly is massive. For $6.50 before taxes, the styrofoam plate includes large pieces of barbecue chicken, a scoop of white rice, and a scoop of macaroni salad over lettuce. Their food has always been tasty and filling. To add additional flavor to the food, I have taken advantage of the sauces on the table when I poured hiercha sauce on the barbecue chicken and soy sauce over the white rice. 

    It is funny that early in this review, I compared the restaurant atmosphere with a Chinese take out restaurant on account of the fact that Ohana has expanded into Asian food. To the left of the counter there is a menu of Asian food dishes that include Chinese food. This menu is nothing compared to the large menu on the wall starboard of the counter that displays the sundry of Hawaiian dishes. Personally I will probably never find out what their Asian dishes taste like considering that I prefer an Asian restaurant for Asian cruisine and a Hawaiian restaurant for Hawaiian cruisine. 

    Ohana lives in my mind as one of the many great Hawaiian barbecue restaurants in the Las Vegas valley. Currently the advantage that Ohana has over the others is that it sits in the shadow of the brand new  hot and popular Coffee Hunter. It serves a fantastic and affordable lunch that ties in with subsequently hanging out in the Coffee Hunter."}
{"text":"Staff & food are awesome. I love it when they greet u as u go in and nice as a hungry customer like me orders"}
{"text":"When I want Hawaiian food close to my house, I come here. It's not fancy or innovative, but the servings are huge, the quality is consistent, and the prices can't be beat. I know that I'll be eating quality Hawaiian or Chinese food when at Ohana.

This location is a lot nicer than the one on Eastern/Warm Springs, which makes sense because this is the newest location. As a small bonus, there's usually sports playing on the TVs."}
{"text":"When you go to a Hawaiian restaurant you expect huge portions. Ohana fits that bill. The food was solid and comparable to what you'd find at L&L. The interesting thing about this place was the variety of choices on the menu. Obviously you'll find traditional Hawaiian items, but you can also order Chinese, Thai, and some American items too. I'd probably stay away from ordering a cheeseburger at a Hawaiian restaurant, but I won't fault them for it. If I go to a Hawaiian restaurant, I'm there to eat Hawaiian food. I had the BBQ Mix plate and it was enjoyable. I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. I'll definitely be here again."}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer. Everything looks amazing. Fast service and food is always great. Pineapple chicken is bomb."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The spam fried rice is delicious!!! I'm a crazy spam fan and i get my fix of it here haha.  The service is always friendly and pretty fast.  I will continue to come here"}
{"text":"Delicious food very clean definitely kills L&L I love this place.  Just ordered the salmon and the beef and the spam rolls we don't have this in New York so I'm definitely coming back before I leave back"}
{"text":"Ohana was my first experience with anything proclaiming to be Hawaiian. Parking is always a bit tight as the Starbucks and other places close by bring in quite a few people. Once you step inside the place is clean and bright. They have a flat screen showing ESPN to distract you while you wait a few seconds for someone to take your order. 

The person taking my order suggested non-fried offerings so I ended up ordering a Half and Half plate: BBQ Chicken, Garlic Shrimp, and a drink. Under $8 for it all, not bad. I get my drink cup, head to the fountain dispenser and one dispenser is broke. I ended up getting Sierra Mist which is meh on a good day, but this was flat. Bleech. 

My food gets brought to the table and after a couple of bites I get up and get some soy / teriyaki sauce and some Sriracha sauce because while the garlic shrimp was good, the BBQ was woefully disappointing. I was able to cut the meat with a plastic fork and knife but that's the only praise it gets. As for BBQ, this is more like the stuff Sysco or US Foodservice sells at the lowest price point and says the sauce will make it into real BBQ. Sorry folks, my 14 year old niece's first attempt at BBQ with too many charcoal briquets and way too much lighter fluid had more taste than this stuff. And I can't forget the double scoop of the most boring white rice imaginable

After having this I'm thinking the closest I want to get to Hawaiian food is to go to the store and buy me a fresh pineapple, slice it and call it a day. (Seriously I'll keep looking as this was not even close to what I had hoped for!) 1 star for service, 1 star for the garlic shrimp."}
{"text":"This place has great slam masubi! I thought all masubi were created equal, but they are not. Ohana's spam masubi is fresh, big, and hot. Almost a meal in itself. After being impressed by the simple appetizer, I decided to give their other menu item a try.

The beef chow fun was ok. The noodles were not greasy, but the meat was kind of dry. It was not the melt in your mouth kind of beef I have had elsewhere in a chow fun dish. Probably would not order again.

The pork manapua was good. It had seasoned pork inside, but not to be confused with the sweeter char siu red pork. I enjoyed the smaller size of them and four came in an order.

The Spam and Eggs rice plate was ok too. The regular size portion is huge! It also comes with a big scoop of macorini salad. You also get the option of getting the egg scrambled or sunny side up. I went with the sunny side up. The spam was seared well so it had a good charred crust on the outside. The eggs were not seasoned, but I suppose there is enough sodium in the spam already. I added salt and pepper layer, but that's just my preference. 

The Salt and Pepper Calamari was a surprise winner for me. It was tender and had a good batter on the outside. A little salty and a little heat was just enough contrast of flavor for me. I also got two free eggrolls because my order was over twenty dollars. The eggrolls were kind of greasy and was the vegetable kind I was not a fan of.

The service is very friendly and pretty fast. The dining area is clean, casual, with a decent amount of seats. They have a TV in there and it usually is showing a sports game. Sometimes basketball and sometimes football. Overall, I would come back again for the spam masubi and salt and pepper calamari. I would try other menu items in the future for sure."}
{"text":"It's alright. It's better than L&L. On the Katsu side of things. Better quality or so what my boyfriend and I think. I had to knock off two stars because it was grand opening week... If you buy one boba you get another one free for checking in on yelp. So I bought one Thai tea boba and I wanted to get the taro for free. They said taro was not one of the options and that anything else is free. So I told her if I can buy the taro and get the Thai tea for free and she said they couldn't do it because they were limited on taro so they couldn't do it on the special deal. If it's grand opening week and you're trying to gain more customers. I would expect them to honor it regardless if you were limited. At least let me BUY the taro and get the Thai tea for free. It's better to give it to a happy customer instead of saving taro because it's \"limited\". Like why are you saving taro? The point is to sell the food/drink. Not save it. First come, first serve. Then you can tell your customers you're all out."}
{"text":"I had to update my review since I've been back to order from all their menus!

So, there's two sides of this location. The left is for dine-in service and on the right, you order at the counter and you can dine in if you want. The right side is solely takeout containers. I've only experienced the left side; it's nice to eat out of real bowls/plates, but the service is always spotty.

My return visits were prompted by my mom's desire to find the same \"Crispy Gau Gee Mein\" with cake noodles that I love from Hawaii. Their Pan-Fried Crispy Noodles are pretty similar and was the only dish I enjoyed from my initial visit, so I told her that it may satisfy her craving. Fortunately, she does like it! Our most recent visit, we didn't order the Crispy Gau Gee, but enjoyed the noodles very much! The dish does tend to be salty, but it wasn't as bad the second time. We also tried the Wanton Noodle Soup the previous visit and it wasn't very good.

Since I haven't had much luck with the \"Noodles\" and \"Chinese\" menus, I focused on the Hawaiian menu like their other locations.

Garlic Noodles ($5.95): This dish is udon noodles saut√©ed/pan-fried with copious amounts of garlic. Delicious! I really enjoy these noodles and they go great with the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken.

Combo Plate ($10.25): Kalua Pork with Cabbage and Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. This comes with your standard two scoops of white rice (no brown rice available) and one scoop of macaroni salad. I like their Kalua Pork because it's tender and had the right amount of salt. I usually don't order Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, so I was really surprised how great it tasted! They do it really, really well.

Service is spotty. Everyone is really nice, but they tend to forget about you and you have to hunt someone down for water refills, etc. 

Recap: Great location to dine in for Hawaiian eats! Beware the Chinese/Noodles menu."}
{"text":"It's the oddest thing - I never thought I'd enjoy a strip mall \"Hawaiian BBQ\" joint, especially more than Hawaiian BBQ restaurants in town, but I really do. They just do it better. Of course, nothing really compares to home, but when I have a hankering for Chicken Cutlet (Chicken Katsu with brown gravy) or Kalua Pork with Cabbage, it is delicious. These two dishes are really all I want to eat when it comes to Hawaiian BBQ, so that is how I gauge the taste and quality of Hawaiian restaurants. 

Their chicken katsu is moist with a crispy breading, while their gravy is very tasty. I love that their Kalua pork is moist with tender cabbage, and delicious juices. Their plate lunches come with consistently tasty sticky rice and their Mac Salad is satisfactory. Huge portions for under $10. Service is also very quick. I called my order in during my last two visits and the food was ready within ten minutes. 

FYI: There is a $0.50 charge for credit card transactions under $15."}
{"text":"Grand opening ....Busy night food was great had to wait a little longer for my laulau plate...overall great food will come back"}
{"text":"Awesome place , awesome service. 

I love their Chrispy gau gee , the only sucky thing is that they don't sale it buy the piece. How do they not sake it by the piece I'm pretty sure they can modify ."}
{"text":"Ohana is one of my Fave Five on my phone. Why not? With addictive favorites like their Saimin, Chicken Katsu (I swear, if you're gonna ingest processed deep-fried breaded stuff anyway you might as well enjoy it), Loco Moco, and all matters of curry, it's the perfect pick-me-up for the long haul. Add the extra calories and mayo goodness of the traditional macaroni salad side, and you're easily consuming close to Phelpsian calories if you eat here three times a day. Which I was doing, at one point in my life, until I couldn't bear to smell the Katsu or the green curry sauce any more without dry heaving. Then 24 hours would pass, I'd realize that there are no more leftovers in the fridge, and I'd hit them up again. When placing phone orders, it's often a toss up whether you get the bored college dude or the congenial older lady who doesn't multitask very well, but has a winning smile that reminds me of my cooler senile aunts. At first, I attributed this to her newness on the job, but still getting my usual order screwed up six months later is just bad organizational skills. Not a big deal though, just something to keep in mind when making complex orders over the phone. 

PROTIP: When ordering lunch, call in around 1130. This gives them enough time to open and warm up the ingredients, but does not place you amid the lunch rush. Dinner is often the reverse; I've gotten hefty helpings AFTER the dinner rush many times, a fortunate occurrence I attribute to calling in that brief moment of clarity between \"holy shit that was brutal\" and \"we're almost closed.\" Experiment as you wish, results may vary."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Some may say isn't the best Hawaiian place around, but I say they are wrong. This restaurant has more of an asian-hawaiian fusion thing going on. They serve the best fried rice, which is great for me since I judge most restaurants by their fried rice, and this one tops the charts! The spam musubi, in my opinion, is way better than Island Flavor or L&L. I always order one and eat it the next day for breakfast. Yum!"}
{"text":"Why did you close? This place was among my favorite go-to restaurants in the area and now the other locations are too far to deliver. I will dream of chicken katsu with curry as I damn the owners for giving up. 

On a related note, there are now not any Hawaiian BBQ joints in the green valley area. Any restauranteurs out there listen: you will have a loyal customer in me if you open one up!"}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and affordable. Just how I like her. Food here is great and service is excellent. For the low price we are paying, you get a large portion of food. If I ordered someone for myself, it would be two meals for me. I love it here."}
{"text":"Ive never had authentic hawaiian food, but i do like their bbq mix here. The macaroni salad is super creamy and yummy, the meat is soft, sometimes there is excess fat on the meat and thats a downer but i always come back. Strongly recommended for take out."}
{"text":"I really love how close this location is to my house. They staff is always so friendly. I remember coming here when my first daughter was just a wee-little baby. Now she's almost 6 so it's just nuts to know that I've been eating this amazing food for that long. I did move around the valley so I didn't have the luxury of this local joint as close, but let me tell you... We are reunited and it feels SOO GOOD! 

I usually get the bbq combo plate. That comes with a combination 3 different meats (teriyaki chicken, beef & spare ribs), two scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad! I am a sucker for that macaroni salad, so I always order a second on the side. (I do that at every Hawaiian joint I go to! How weird of me!) 

Lately, we have been getting the Saiman noodles because it is so quick and delicious. It will really fill you up if you're in a hurry. I can't lie, I'm also a big time sucker for the dang masubis. So I usually get 1. If my kids are with me, I HAVE to get them each one, or I won't live to see tomorrow!

I'm very glad that this location is so close, and the staff is friendly, I just wish inside wasn't so cramped. It just makes this claustrophobic, give-me-my-food-so-I-can-get-out-of-here feel. I usually order to-go so I don't have to worry, but man most of the time the food smells so good I can't help but tear that bag open and indulge! 

I LOVE the variety of Hawaiian Sun tropical drinks, it just is a nice way to refresh yourself and really get that Hawaiian feel.  

I'm so craving some of this now!! I totally can't wait to splurge on my diet and chow down!"}
{"text":"Ohana Hawaiian BBQ was just okay to me. I ordered take out & was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes but when I got there the total wait was over 20 minutes. Their musubi was good. The chicken katsu was good but I was not a fan of their mac salad. Their mac salad was very watered down & didn't have much flavor at all. The one thing I did love though was their malasadas! They weren't too greasy & had just the right amount of sweetness to them. I may or may not come back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place since they opened it, love the kung pao, good size portions, my favorite Hawaiian food spot"}
{"text":"The chicken katsu taste great! I love how they have a mini size so I don't over eat. The girls that work here are really nice and efficient too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the phone-in service. I usually get the chicken katsu, kalua pork and spam musubi and it's always been great. The service is excellent...much better than that joke of a restaurant Aloha Kitchen near UNLV."}
{"text":"This place is good. They have all the typical Hawaiian stuff and it's always good. Prices are in line with what you'd expect, they're always friendly and never takes very long, especially if you call ahead to order. BBQ Mix is great and usually my go to dish. This place is far superior to Island Flavor and really the only good Hawaiian food joint in the far SW."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for 8 years and it's always so good. It seems that when the older lady is in I'll just call her mamasan she always checks to make sure food is right. Keep it up and I'll keep coming. Aloha."}
{"text":"I live very close to this location and it's so convenient for me to come here I love it! I enjoy their chicken Katsu teriyaki beef and garlic shrimp the most. Their spam musubi's are very good too. They always make my orders very quickly I have my food within 10 minutes I've brought numerous friends here and they love it too. I like their Hawaiian sodas and their Thai tea. As long as I'm living in this area I'll be going there frequently."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my boyfriend and ordered the Kalua pork and Lau Lau combo! The food was delicious and the portion sizings were huge. Their mac salad was also pretty good too! I would say it was pretty comparable to L&L Hawaiian BBQ! Their service was also outstanding! We maybe waited like 5-10 mins at most for our food to come out. I would definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"You don't know the story! More kau kau then you ever handle lol anyways it's great restaurant in n out . Then go cause it's bed time. Check it out go try."}
{"text":"Really friendly service and delicious food!

So far I have tried:

Garlic shrimp mini lunch plate (u can specify shell on or peeled)
*this was very flavorful but a little heavy on the salt
Would not order again, but I am very picky about salt, try it for yourself as it seems popular!

Loco Moco mini lunch plate
*everything I expected it to be! Flavorful and very satisfying
Would order again

Pineapple crab rangoon
*simple but delicious
Would order again

Plain Saimin
*Broth is very flavorful! Noodles are oily but tasty
Would order again

Side of mixed veggies
*wouldnt order these again...broccoli was yellowing and there were dark (mold?) spots on all the veggies

Side of curry
*50 cents for a side! I have never had curry from Hawaiian place before so I was scared to order curry dish without trying sauce and I'm so glad I ordered a side of it because OMG it is delicious! It tastes like a cross between indian curry and thai curry almost. Very delicous, and a tiny bit of heat!

Spring rolls 
Macaroni salad
White rice
*all of the above come with the lunch plates. I love the mac salad! 

Spam musibi
*It's like a giant sushi roll but with spam! Would order again

What my stars mean: 

5 is outstanding, a must-experience, someplace I would bring/recommend to a tourist

4 is great, someplace I would love to go back to again and again. Backup options to bring/recommend to a tourist 

3 is good. Someplace I would return to if in the area. I probably wouldn't recommend to a tourist, but possibly to a local. 

2 is ok but only because it is either cheap or convenient.

1 means I would not return"}
{"text":"Ohana's is walking distance from my house.  If I were to rate this place relative to other Hawaiian spots in Las Vegas I would say it's better than L&L bbq and doesn't quite reach the standards of Aloha kitchen.  I'll review a couple dishes that I get on the regular:

BBQ Beef Bowl:  Awesome bang for your buck.  At $4.95 you get a fist full portion of teriyaki beef on top of steamed veggies and rice.  I have a pretty big appetite and this dish always leaves me satisfied.

Chicken Katsu:  The chicken katsu is right on par.  They use all white chicken.  If you like a little dark meat in your katsu you may get sick off all the white meat.  The katsu sauce is just right.  Not to different than most places which I like.  Really can't go wrong.

BBQ Beef Plate:  The bbq beef plate was just okay.  BBQ Chicken....good, BBQ Beef....good, Kalbi Beef...not so good.  I think what really killed this plate was the Kalbi.  How do you make Kalbi wrong?!  Well, if you don't marinade it long enough and the Kalbi doesn't taste like, well...Kalib!

So, anyhow, Hawaiian food is like a staple to my diet as well as a great way to maintain my high cholesterol.  If you are in the area it's a great place to stop by and pick up food or have dinner with the family.  However, It's not really a place you would go out of your way for.

I'm really glad that they are in business serving some go ol Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"This is right by our house.  I've gone here a handful of times and keep going.  I feel like the the bbq beef or chicken bowl is a great deal for $4.95.  There plates have a ton of food.  BBQ, 2 scoops of rice, and macaroni salad.  I always....always get Spam Musibi!  So good. 

The environment is nice.  Not fancy but, clean.  They have a flat screen that seems to always have sports on which is nice.  This is a good place for a quick lunch or dinner.

Anyhow, the food here is pretty good.  I wouldn't say it sticks out to be one of the best but, I'll keep going for more when I'm hungry or need a fast meal."}
{"text":"We searched and searched for good island style Hawaiian food here in Vegas. This is the best place we've found. Their Mac salad is spot on (always the sign of true Hawaiian food). Chicken and short ribs are our fav's! Their curry is good and has a kick to it (at least to us, but we're kinda spice wimps). When we first discovered this place we actually found ourselves making excuses to get over to that side of town to eat here!  This is the location in with the Von's grocery store, its in the strip mall just south of the store. We are considering having a party at our house just so we can cater their yummy food (prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality and quantity of food)!!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot to get lunch.  I always grab a spam musubi and some Thai tea.  For the days where I need a meal I'll buy the chicken katsu as well.  I've been going here for 5 years and nothing has changed.  There have been a few additions to the menu but I keep it simple with the katsu or the loco moco.  It's a tiny restaurant with 5 tables inside so I usually get my food to-go.  I recommend phoning your order in because this place can get busy, especially around 2pm when the high school kids are out.  If you prefer a more relaxed sit down restaurant with dessert, I recommend Island Flavor down the street, but for fast food Hawaiian style, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy getting food here. My fellow employees and I always get the spam musubi and chicken musubi from here. I've also had the Loco moco which is also very good. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some good Hawaiian food at a good price. Unfortunately, there is a little bit of a language barrier which caused a little bit of frustration. Other then that it is a good place and I will keep coming."}
{"text":"Ohana is a very good choice for lunch or dinner. The food is great, priced right for Hawaiian (they have Asian also). The portions are the right size, half orders are usually enough, but go for a full order if you're really hungry. My favorite is the Chicken Katsu. They're the go to place when me and my friends can't agree on a place to go, no one ever dislikes Ohana. Also, they deliver, so you don't even have to go in to enjoy Ohana!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, this small business is packed with flavor.  I walked in at lunchtime and every table was full.  Being that it was my first time, the menu was a little overwhelming.  Luckily they have pictures on the wall of all the different dishes.  Immediately I knew the Pineapple Chicken would be my choice.  Be sure to come hungry.  This meal was enough for two people!  The chicken is marinated in a yellow pineapple sauce with real chunks of pineapple in it.  It has a side of white rice and macaroni salad that is out of this world.  My friend got the more adequately sized BBQ Beef Bowl.  The succulent beef has a delicious sauce that compliments the rice, cabbage, broccoli, and carrots below.

All in all, this was my first of many trips to this location.  Fantastic food at the right price.  A+++"}
{"text":"I'm under the impression that Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is a chain in Las Vegas, but you definitely get a completely different experience at each location.

The Husband ordered the Chicken Katsu and Kalbi Short Ribs Combo, while I ordered the Pork Lau Lau  Their two scoops of rice and one scoop of mac salad is an embarrassment to Hawaiian food.  When I opened my box, I thought they were kidding.  What's up with the small scoops?  Definitely disappointing on that part alone.

The short ribs tastes okay, but my pork was super dry.  There were minimal fatty pieces, and everyone knows a good lau lau should have some decent amount of fatty pieces! 

Service can be improved here.  The only girl working was outside socializing with some guys.  I needed more napkins and since they are behind the counter, I had to go outside to request more.  It seemed like I was bothering her.  

Overall, there are way better Hawaiian restaurants in Vegas that do better in food (quality and quantity) and service.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Noted as \"Hawai'i's Best Plate Lunch Special\" on their business card, I could only vouch for their Pork Lau Lau plate.  

My first time dining there in June, I ordered the Pork Lau Lau then and couldn't really give them a fair review.  My taste buds were shot and everything tasted bland.

This time around, healthy and taste buds in full working order, I went ahead and ordered my favorite, the Pork Lau Lau.  I also asked for two scoops of mac salad instead of two scoops of rice.  (Most Hawaiian restaurants will substitute without charging, so I usually prefer to do that.)

The pork lau lau was definitely a lot better than the one I had at Aloha Specialties Restaurant in the California Hotel!  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg?hrid=XPspyfknURLxczv4O2ZUvg)  It wasn't dry and old like the other place and had a lot more flavor.  I did add a lot of soy sauce to my dish, which I tend to do all the time.  I could have used a bit more fat in mine too, but that's more of a personal preference.

When I was done cleaning off my plate of two scoops of mac salad, one scoop of rice, and the pork lau lau dish,  my boyfriend looked at me and asked if that was a mini order or a full plate.  \"Uh, a full one...they didn't offer the mini for the pork lau lau...\"  I guess it was his way of calling me a piggie! Haha!

I also had their spam musubi and it was definitely better than Aloha's again!  It tasted like what a spam musubi should taste like!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get Ramen, food is excellent also a great value we eat here at least once a week. For less than $20 get you a nice dinner for two. Everything seems very fresh. Service is spot on can be a bit busy at times."}
{"text":"Really good portions, but I won't be going back here ever again... Food was okay, the rice tasted kind of old and the tartar sauce the cashier gave me had been out all day so it turned yellow I thought It was a mistake they gave me mustard but yeah ewwww.... ever heard of refrigerating your tartar sauce? Customer service was also not the best, the cashier lady was rude and it seemed like she was talking shit to the cook as they yelled back and forth. If you're looking to try this place, don't. Just go to L&L, at least their cashiers over there are nice and they refrigerate their tartar sauce!"}
{"text":"The food here is always delish!!!! Good pricing as well for the amount of food! We enjoy it a lot!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and we have it a couple times a month. My kids love the BBQ chicken. It comes with mac salad, steamed rice and it's served on a bed of shredded cabbage. It's a big portion and most times I will order 1 and share with my kids (4 and 8). The garlic shrimp is really good!! The Chinese menu is good too. Shrimp fried rice, combination fried rice, Kung pao shrimp, chow mien are all good. The only thing I tried and didn't like was the soup."}
{"text":"Food was so good, we got the triple protein platter and the pork belly buns, so good, and lots of it, plenty of leftovers! And our server, Jessica was so friendly and attentive as well!"}
{"text":"Slow ass service but who gives a a shit when you can get some BBQ chicken for only $6.50. This place is cheap and filling, just like how I like my hookers"}
{"text":"This is my fav Hawaiian \"fast food\". I used to go here for lunch when I worked close.  Now, I'll  drive from green valley/horizon ridge to get it even for dinner. Value & Portion size is never an issue. I've tried chicken katsu, chick katsu curry, curry chicken, bbq chicken, loco moco, chow fun combo, beef saimen soup, spam saimen, spam musing, spring rolls, and rangoons, and once my daughter had a cheeseburger meal. I have never had a bad meal.  The service is always friendly although I know they are always looking for good help. I'll continue to be a regular here unless they get another location closer to me ! *wink wink*"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price for the portions! Many Hawaiian food items not found at similar restaurants back home. Good service!"}
{"text":"Today was the \"I don't know what I want to eat, so I'm just going to drive and stop somewhere\" kind of day.  My work brought be close to the Green Valley area and I ultimately decided on Ohana.

I've been to Ohanas many times and I don't think it's the best I've had here in Vegas.  Insead of driving all around the creation, I decided to eat here because it was conveniently located across the street from my job. Whenever I visit this place, I always get the mahi mahi plate for $8.  It's breaded like chicken katsu and super good. Today I decided to change it up and got the BBQ salmon mini plate for $5.95.  The salmon was lightly sauced with BBQ and had nice grill marks.  It was super flaky and perfectly cooked.  SOO glad I got it. The plate lunch had too much Mac salad, kinda overkill. I also got a spam Musubi for 1.85, which was a great treat.  Usually, my pet peeve is when the nori wrapping is not crispy enough and doesn't breaks apart easy.  This musubi was quite the opposite. The teriyaki sauce in it was a great compliment.

Overall, it was a great random choice.  I felt satisfied and not too heavy.  Definitely would recommend the fish options here.  They have leaving with a smile on your face.  Definitely better than L&L BBQ."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Hawaiian BBQ.  I'm from Hawaii and that's no surprise.  I came to this location the same night I visited Cold Stone.  There was a super long wait at the creamery, so I stopped in Ohana for a couple of musubis.  The great thing is they only cost $4 total!  

They put some tangy teriyaki sauce in the musubi.  The spam slices were thick and the best part:  the nori seaweed is crispy.  That means it was fresh!  

The only thing that turned me off was the girl that worked there.  Her sentences were prolonged by an irritating emphasis on her vowels and S's.  I don't mean to be a jerk, however, I was super turned off by this.  She was nice, true.  Maybe I wasn't in the best of moods.  Hopefully on my next visit, I can better assess this situation."}
{"text":"Ohana isn't bad for a quick Hawaiian fix!  

This joint is in walking distance to my house, so we frequent it a lot if we're in the mood for rice and don't want to cook.  I wouldn't say its the most amazing Hawaiian food around, but its cheap and its decent.

I would have to say that this place has its \"on\" days and it also has their \"off\" days.  Sometimes it's like wow that was amazing.. others its like dammit, why did we go here today.

A few noteworthy items:

- BBQ Mix Plate:  Plenty of meat for the price and enough for two people to share.
- Loco Moco:  Their patties and gravy are pretty good - does the job if your craving.
- Chicken/Beef Teriyakis:  Nice flavors in the teriyaki, meat is usually pretty most.
- Spam and Eggs:  Can't never mess this up!

Stay away from:
Saimin:  Way too salty for my taste.
Mac Salad:  I know this comes as a side for most combos, but I'm not a fan of the bland.

They started selling Chinese food more recently and I'd have to say its pretty good.  Better than most Chinese take out joints.  We tried the Shrimp Chow Mein and Mongolian beef recently and thumbs up to both!

Food is decent, service is quick.  Try it out for yourself sometime!"}
{"text":"First Hawaiian bbq place we've tried. We've been to both the Durango and blue diamond locations and both locations have good customer service. The Hawaiian bbq mix is sooo good and the portions of each orders are good for 2. Love this place... we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Hawaiian food! I'm excited to inform you that they are expanding and the cashier said it's going to be a Saimin house! (Right next door) All ramen noodles! Really excited for this. We need a noodle house around this side of town. Be expecting a new addition in a couple of weeks! ;)"}
{"text":"Really good hawaiian bbq place! Love the meats it seems much more fresh than any other fast food hawaiian places. Order the Mix plate or the Chicken Katsu. Everything seems much more fresh and less commercialized. They also have good ramen soup and their musabi are really good.. good prcies too.. They have daily specials each day check it out! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken full of flavor. Their chicken katsu is among one of the best katsu I have ever had.  Light and very crispy katsu breading, not overly fried.  Huge portion to boot.  I suspect other items are equally yummy.  Will have to find out."}
{"text":"Aloha! This yummy gem is located in the Target Shopping center all the way on the left by Kohls off of Blue Diamond and Arville. Inside is very clean and spacious. Service is fast and friendly. If you know what you want you could call in advance to order for pick up like i always do. 

Chicken Cutlet with Gravy - Very Good. Nice crispy batter on the outside and moist chicken on the inside. Served with rice and macaroni salad. 

Macaroni Salad - Good. Perfectly Seasoned

Spam Musubi - Good 

Short Ribs - Good. Nice big pieces perfectly seasoned and grilled

Chicken - Good and moist

So glad this is convienently located here in the southwest. Whenever im craving hawaiian food this is my go to place to order from."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm insane.  I'm afraid to even write this review... but... I did not like my food at Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  I got the BBQ mix plate with short ribs, chicken, and beef.  The beef was so chewy and fatty that I couldn't chew through it.  The short ribs were gristly too.  The only decent thing was the chicken, but it wasn't anything special.  My fianc√© had the katzu chicken, which was just okay too.  Afterwards, I was disappointed, so I ordered a thai tea... I wanted it to be better than it was.  However, it had this funky aftertaste that I just couldn't get past.

Maybe I just had random a bad experience, judging by the other reviews.  Dunno."}
{"text":"Customer service is always great! Staff are friendly and courteous! I would recommend anyone come here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week.  They're garlic shrimp is great.  I would recommend the 2 or 3 combo if you're a hefty eater cause they come in good size portions.  However they're fried shrimp is not something to rave about.  Overall, they food is good (not great) and the service is fairly good."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I would go here every week. However, today we bought food and asked for a water cup. We got water, then soda. One of the waitresses approached us and told us kindly we couldn't do that because it's only for water so we stopped drinking it. Then another waitress approached us and raised her voice saying \"You can't do that! You need to dump it out.\" I was rudely interrupted while eating and I've never experienced a waitress yell at us that way. Workers at McDonald's don't even do that. We bought food, it's not like we kept going up to get a drink. Never going here again."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I just witnessed the most f'd up thing ever at this place, this little boy came in to buy a spam musubi and was short by $.12 so that old bat cashier told him, no you need $.12 this little boy looked like he was going to cry but didn't want to embarrass himself in front of all his little karate friends. He couldn't have been more than 8years old. I quietly slid a quarter over to him and gave the old lady a look of disgust!! Like REALLY?!? As busy as this place is you hurting for $.12?!? I'll never go back to this place again!!! There's a NEW Ohana on rainbow and Windmill!!! Unreal some people these days!!! DISGUSTING GREED IS WHAT IT IS!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Very great customer service and excellent menu! The easiest way to order take out is to call your order in advance just to save you some time. Great prices and a good size portion of food to share with someone!"}
{"text":"Love the garlic shrimp & thai tea w/ boba. However the cashiers should STOP answering the phone while they take your order. This happened 3x..."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this place is better than L&L BUT I've tried their specialty dishes, and they are the BOMB.Com! They also give u a generous amount and the staff are very pleasant. I recommend you dine in than takeout."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. Spam musubi's are the best and dont forget about their homemade teriyaki the bomb.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Was so happy when I found a Hawaiian restaurant and couldn't wait to try my favorite garlic shrimp. My shrimp were so bland tasted like they were dipped in butter and salt. I wouldn't return here"}
{"text":"Ohana offers chinese food thats pretty decent for a hawaiian place they still do your typical mix plates and katsus but if you want to mix some chinese food in the mix which i do everytime, then go here. i usually order a bbq mix plate and i either order some chow fun or pan fried crispy noodle chow mein."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. The wait was rediculous, person that comes in and places order after you gets served first and then when you finally get your order it's horrible. We ordered the chicken Katsu and it was like biting into a grease logged sponge. You can look at the chicken and see it was refried. I broke up with the boyfriend for taking me to the worst Hawaiian place I've ever been to. It's not even worth one star, the app was not allowing me to post without some kind of rating.

Guys if you want your girl to break up with you, take them to ohana. You will be left high and dry holding your last love...Chicken Katsu."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place. Food is always great and people are friendly. Ordered 2 minis today and the portions are pretty big size."}
{"text":"I love this place, whenever I'm craving Hawaiian food I always go to Ohana's just because the taste hits close to home. My usual is the half and half combo with bbq chicken and garlic shrimp (if very hungry I add in beef chow fun or salt & pepper shrimp.) The cashiers are amazing - Shane and Alyssa! I'm always coming in each week and they always have great customer service. There's two sides to Ohana's, their Hawaiian BBQ side and their noodle side, noodle side is a dine in setting where you could chose from their noodle options (ramen/ pho.) I've dined on. I've dined on both sides and it's delicious and equally as amazing!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Hawaiian BBQ in a while and decided to check Ohana's out with my boyfriend. First impression walking into the restaurant was great. The cashier greeted us right away and was very friendly!

I ordered my favorite, BBQ Chicken and my boyfriend got the Kalua Pig and Laulau plate. The BBQ Chicken was delicious, it tasted like home in Hawaii. However, the Kalua Pig tasted a bit weird, different to what we are used to. It would have been great if there was more of a smoked/natural taste to the meat. This place deserves 4 stars for their amazing costumer service and BBQ Chicken though!"}
{"text":"New favorite spot! It's a little drive for me but it's worth it! L&L was the spot but not anymore , the portion of the food is just right for the prices! They're not stingy with their sauces or drinks! I ordered the chicken katsu and there is no fat on it, crispy, and give you enough to satisfy you



I love it & they also deliver"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Ohana! My go to is the Garlic shrimp...it's so good. I've tried to branch out but it's just something  about them. I'll admit they could toss in a few more for the price. The service is always quick and friendly but I tend to call ahead. I have noticed some people have to wait a while.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"My fiance frequents this place for lunch because it's near his office and cheap. We split the BBQ mix for dinner the other night ($7.85). On the plus side it was an INSANE amount of food. The two of us couldn't finish the enormous portion. On the negative side 60% of the meat on it is chicken.. and just OK chicken. I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of the beef on the plate either. We got a side of steamed dumplings ($3.25) and they were good. 

My fiance assures me the Pork Katsu is way better, so maybe next time I'll give that a try. It was clean, fast, and cheap so I'm definitely game for giving them a 2nd chance. 

Rumor is they are opening a new one in Henderson soon.. !"}
{"text":"I love the Blue Diamond location. I stop by here regularly and order take out for dinner. They have Hawaiian and Chinese menu. Great prices and the food is fabulous."}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood combo (breaded shrimp, breaded fish fillet & short rib kalbi) as well as the chicken katsu. The sauce that came with the seafood combo, which I think its tartar sauce it is a bit more on the mustard side so be aware of that. It's still delicious though. The chicken katsu was exactly what the menu described as well. This is my second time trying Ohana BBQ and I must say I'm not disappointed! And the fact we are able to order through the DinerDash App to get it delivered! Thank you Miguel for delivering our food! (Btw, loved your colorful socks!)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go for a quick meal on a lazy day. My family and I often come here for either their soup or other dishes. It's close to home with good food and friendly staff. They have two restaurants under one roof. They have their Chinese/Hawaiian side and their noodle soup side. Both good. Price is okay for many of their items but I think some items are a bit overpriced. We often get their salt n pepper pork chops and salt n pepper calamari. It's good but i don't think you get enough for the price you pay. Again, we keep coming back because it's convenient and it's good. Very flavorful."}
{"text":"I really liked this spot.  Its a melting pot of food options like the island and its people.

You have a little Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, Filipino and lotta Hawaiian, especially thier customer service.

The girls there were bery friendly and helpful. I watched one of them talk to an elderly couple and she was so respectful and patient, something you rarely see these days.

There are two sides to the joint, noodles and bbq, but you can kinda order same things either side.  I was craving noodles so...  

What I love is that you van pick any noodle with any type of soup.  I got the pork belly ramen with spinach noodles.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I give 3.5 stars. We've tried this place several times and had their delicious Hawaiian combo platters. We finally decided to try their Chinese food..that was a mistake. We had the general chicken, combo fried rice, and chow fun. All of which was very bland. Honestly, I could made much better chow fun and fried rice at home. I was just too tired last night to cook. 

Overall this place is good. Their Hawaiian and Vietnamese dishes are delicious!"}
{"text":"We visit the Blue Diamond location a lot, near home. I really enjoy that the taste of the food is always consistent and the portions are a good size. A lot of the dishes have a Regular and a Mini size (less 1 scoop of rice and smaller entree).

They have added a Chinese food menu, most of the common dishes that is available in restaurants. Singapore noodles, Beef Chow Funn, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, Salt & Pepper Calamari and more! We always order the Salt & Pepper dishes, they are made very tasty and crispy.

This location opened a \"Noodles\" next door, which offers Pho (Vietnamese Noodles), meat spring rolls, and a lot more. We've ordered from that menu and I must say, the taste is very good! Now my husband has a place to go to for his Vietnamese food fix close to home rather than going all the way to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food and the environment. But lately when I go to this location there is always poor customer service with one of the cashier and it's the same cashier all the time. She's the older mid age lady that's a different race than the others working there. The other cashiers are very friendly and welcoming but for some reason that cashier is either always in a bad mood or has terrible customer service. I'm a host at a fine dinning restaurant l so I know a lot about customer service and tonight was just terrible with that lady. Its not the first time it's happened and I was understanding before thinking she was just having a bad day but I guess not."}
{"text":"Clean environment; casual setting. Fair prices. Good portions. Friendly staff. Tasty food. 

Half portion available for light eaters. Recommended to anyone who enjoys Hawaiian food. Blue Diamond location offers Chinese dishes too."}
{"text":"Best part about Vegas is the diversity of asian/islander food. 
You can find plenty of places and I am just getting started. This place use to have a special for 5 bux which is now 6.25. Still worth it, even though that means its 6.75 with tax and 8 dollars with tip. (better tip dammit!)
Anyway they slam u three long ass pieces of teryaki chicken (i had no idea chikens were so tall!!) when its teryaki day. and its delish. I feed my boo the macaroni salad w siracha and mini pieces of MY chicken mixed in to keep her happy (damn islanders!) but when im alone I always say hold that mayonaise mess (i cant even spell that word its so gross) and slam me 3 scoops of rice. 
Theres 3 0r 4 locations, but after venturing to the one on rainbow I have to say the WS and Eastern spot is the jam of the joint. 
I will go out of my wqay to meetup w people there, if i am anywhere near frys/wholefoods and its tuesday, you best believe Ill be in that parking lot stuffing my fat cheeks and non existant chin with the teriyaki goodness. 

Anwway sorry for the lack of reviews lately, I tried to yelp \"clark county correctional kitchen\" or \"rotten peaches josh insisted on bringing to burning man\" but nothing came up. That joke was pretty much for me. But if it matters to you, yes, I am laughing."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. It's a good melting pot of options. They have soups like pho or ramen, Hawaiian BBQ, your typical Chinese restaurant dishes, and more.

The service is always great and good comes out in a reasonable amount of time. I typically always get the pho, loco mock, kalua pig, or the sweet and sour chicken if I wanna get more for my money and split it in half to eat later or for lunch the next day! 

Their malasadas are so really good!"}
{"text":"Onolicious grinds, large portions , fast and friendly staff. We had noodles, salt n pepper pork chops and grilled garlic spareribs. All entrees under $10. Cant beat that. Will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"My mom and I were driving home and thought \"we don't want to cook tonight, it's late\". So we pulled into the first shopping center we found.. Ohana Hawaiian BBQ so we said \"why not?\"  YOU gotta try this place my Poly Ohana! Really impressed. Good food, really good. Mom and I had broccoli chicken and bought my dad crispy wings. I'm on my 3rd helping, can't stop! Gonna add Ohana Hawaiian BBQ to my FAV's. Would love to show you photos but all you would see is my EMPTY plate!"}
{"text":"Many Hawaiian bbq I have had in my life,but this place really stands out to me with the service and the timeliness of their food. I have enjoyed everything I have ever tried and they have something for whatever Asian food craving you may have.  Not the healthiest type of meals but it definitely hits the spot!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never left disappointed. A friend introduced me to this place and after my first time I was hooked, 20x better than L&L. Can you believe I used to be thrilled by them!? Anyway, I love the Chicken Katsu(w/wo curry) The portions are huge for a cheap price and the people are friendly. I've also gotten the Bbq beef and combo plates, kalua pork, and malasadas. All good! They're about 20 minutes away from my house but I never mind the drive! One of my favorite places by far."}
{"text":"I'm glad that there is a Ohana that opened up near my house. They opened up right next to Taste. Ohana and Taste are actually owned by the same people, which is why there's a door connecting the two inside the establishments. 

I don't usually go to Ohana because I'm not a fan of Hawaiian styled food. I actually only come here if I want some wonton noodle soup. But when you order it, be sure to use the wording they have on their menu. Apparently the cashier can get easily confused. 

They give you a good amount of wontons with the dish ... I think like 8 of them. Each wonton is filled with shrimp goodness. I would actually prefer if there was more pork in there but that is fine. I usually take it to go because I like the chili oil I have at home :D I use a generous spoonful of chili oil and it tastes amazing! Their noodles are cooked perfectly with the right amount of firmness and chew! 

Perfect place for some wonton noodle soup. I don't have to trek over to Chinatown for the dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place eat here at least twice a week. People are very friendly food is amazing and very big. Everything I've ever had here is delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here...
Our orders consisted of the following menu items; BBQ Chicken, Loco Moco, Singapore Noodles, Fried Shrimp and Salmon -the food was all very good. The BBQ had great flavor and so did the Singapore Noodles. I was not impressed with the garlic shrimp, I had it with no shell but the flavor was lacking but overall we had a good experience and we would come back here. The service was great, everyone was very nice and friendly. If you're in the are, check it out!"}
{"text":"I use to eat here all the time when i lived closer, i'm still not that far just lazy. The portions are big and prices are reasonable. Staff is pleasant and efficient. I usually get the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken (mini plate)...one scoop rice one scoop macaroni salad and 4 thin slabs of chicken for 6 $. I was stuffed! It was all cooked perfectly and it was delicious. I don't know why I stopped going.  This trip convinced me that I must return!"}
{"text":"The menu is very similar to L&L Hawaiian BBQ.

The food was pretty darn good!  I shared a Hawaiian BBQ beef platter and it was more than enough for 2.  Their Chicken Katsu with saimin noodles comes out separately, meaning the katsu portion can act as separate meal.  Just ask for the katsu sauce!  The noodles+broth are pretty plain by themselves though.

Would definitely recommend this place for an affordable, quick, meal!"}
{"text":"Decent Hawaiian food on my side of town.  Love their chicken katsu curry!"}
{"text":"Since moving here a few months ago from Hawaii, my cousin and I have been on the prowl for plate lunch places here in Vegas.  While I was digging around in the pantry for some sort of dinner, my cousin asked if I wanted to try Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  No cooking?  Sure!  

My cousin had a chicken katsu and I started off with a BBQ mixed plate.  I usually try this when I go to a plate lunch place for the first time.  A variety pack, you know?  Anyway, my cousin and I both had regular sized plates... so half was for dinner and the other half will be eaten tomorrow.  Sweet deal!

I like this place, so why 4 stars instead of 5?  Well, my rice was a little crunchy.  Kinda off-putting.  I'm hoping that this is just a one time thing.  Mostly, there are a lot more things to try on their menu.  I saw at least 4 different kinds of musubi on the menu.  I saw manapua, malasadas, chicken cutlet, pineapple chicken..

Wait,... pineapple chicken?!  *sigh*"}
{"text":"First time at Ohana and Ill be back. 

Shrimp curry lunch plate was delicious and enough for two people with regular appetites or one super hungry person. Shrimp were huge and fresh and the yellow curry sauce was creamy and slightly sweet heaven. Add two scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad for the lunch special and you are all set. 

Place was clean, lots of options, quick and super friendly service. I look forward to working through the entire menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Vegas has a large Hawaiian population, so there are Hawaiian restaurants all over the place. I've tired many places, but was never satisfied. But this spot here is great. Love it. I want to eventually try their other locations, but for now I only go to the Green Valley spot. I'm a regular there now. My fave thing there is the salmon plate - I get that plate regularly (and never forget the teriyaki sauce, that sauce is so good). I can eat a plate of that every week if I could. 

Also...On different days of the week they have a plate special...$4.99 per meal/plate (for the dish of the day) - which is pretty dope."}
{"text":"I always get the salmon plate. It's great. The rice & macaroni that comes with it tastes great too. I may go here for lunch tomorrow actually. lol Love this place. :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my new favorite place for salt and pepper pork chops! It used to be food express but they've sadly changed the way the make theirs. I like my pork chops extra extra crispy and this place delivers that crunch! I've been here 4 times now with various coworkers and haven't heard one complaint. It's nice to have a choice of Chinese food or traditional Hawaiian food for those with picky friends like mine. There's something for everyone! The chicken katsu is a favorite as well. I've also tried the chicken cake noodle (for the first time) and it reminded me of Hong Kong pan fried noodles with an emphasis on meat and less veggies. The portions are huge and always more than enough for one meal.the ladies who work here are so friendly and accommodating. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because the air conditioning has been awful the last two times I've been there. I mean, I could feel it on but everyone in my group was sweating and fanning in between bites. I'll keep coming back but maybe for takeout more than dining in."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! We ordered a sea food combo and upon eating one of their fried shrimps, I chewed on something hard and it was a finger nail.  I was so disgusted.  Advising everyone NOT to eat here."}
{"text":"The service is horrible.  The woman at the front taking orders did everything possible to NOT take my order.  Then I watched it sit on the counter, while she wrapped food up for others who came behind me.  
Food is tasty however BAD service trumps that every time."}
{"text":"I've been trying new places and I was a bit skeptical because are usually don't like Hawaiian food but I love the meat I got rice with steak on top and it was amazing I would definitely go back recommended for a quick lunch break"}
{"text":"Probably one of my fave quick and easy, close spots to eat hawaiian food. I love coming here for a quick bite of my Hawaii favorites. I usually come here and have friendly service. I gave a 4 star this review because the services wasn't that good today, well from one of the girls, the other one was nice. I was ordering, I guess she didn't hear me good and just went HUH? In a bit of a rude way. I think the workers could smile more and be a little more genuine when it comes to their service. 

I know it gets busy around lunch time. I know how it gets, I use to work in a restaurant. But you should never forget good customer service. Other than that food is always good."}
{"text":"PAN FRIED House combination noodles!!! Ohemgee...so gooood!! This is the closest noodle next to Hawaii style Chinese...noodles are NOT spaghetti noodles it is authentic style thin noodles! Had beef, chix and shrimp! We also ordered the salt n pepper pork chop, orange chicken and fried calamari. All was $32...good price! We will def be back...yummers!"}
{"text":"Better than I remember...we had take out of: Teri beef & garlic shrimp, hamburger steak and Teri chicken bowl.  Teri beef and garlic shrimp were good but Teri beef was little too sweet.  Hamburger steak was frozen pattys but there were 3...strange no onions.  Teri chicken bowl was typical with rice and veggies (cabbage, carrots, broccoli).  All this for $24 and change.  Decent food at a recent price but I'd still go to Island Flavor for the more authentic Hawaii style food.  This food is more geared towards the haole style of taste/presentation...or what is \"thought\" of as Hawaiian style food."}
{"text":"Very good food. Go the BBQ mix and loved all the meats in it. Better than L&L by far."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious. Our regular order is from their Chinese food menu, Orange chicken which is not overly breaded  and Mongolian beef which is always flavorful. Our takeout orders are usually ready pretty quickly. On average no more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Whenever I want loco moco I would always go to the blue diamond location, now they are way closer and I'm always compelled to get musubi. They just opened and the place is very clean, lots of parking and they're connected with Taste. 
The ONLY part I do complain about and I wish management would take note is that whenever I order saimin or anything that does have soup DINING IN, they always pack it on a TO GO with styrofoam and all. I'm not a full on-go green-tree hugger but I REALLY WISH I could eat my soup without having to pour it on the noodles. I feel it's wasteful use of styrofoam. I've ordered saimin and the wonton noodle soup a few times and it always comes in like this. When they improve it I'll bump it up to a 5 star. Just give me a plastic plate or bowl, not styrofoam."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just like all the other restaurants that claim to be \"Hawaiian BBQ.\"  If you are a true native to the islands you will agree that this food is blah and accommodating to those who don't know what real Hawaii local style food is and should taste like. If chicken Katsu is what impresses your taste buds and consider Hawaiian food, there is so much more to experience besides a piece of \"fried chicken.\"  All their soaked meats are soaked in the same soak so they all have that bland taste. Nothing original is brought to this menu. Please go out and experience Hawaii food where the people who cook it and serve it are born and raised in the 808."}
{"text":"Delicious local grinds here :) Great price and much better than the chain competition."}
{"text":"This is my first time going here, the place is clean, service is okay, the time for waiting the food is normal. 
The problem is the FOOD. I ordered a mini Kaibi beef short ribs with mac salad and rice, the mac salad tastes nothing. The ribs is lacking flavor.

 My boyfriend ordered a spam saimin, I only tastes a little of the soup and it tastes like they put a whole bowl of salt in the soup. 

So, both of us didn't finish all our food. Even this place is near the neighborhood, I'll not going back."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the most amazing and delicious hawaiian food in town. Best value! Excellent service! The place is clean and beautiful in the inside, the staff is friendly. The location is convenient. All the food is fresh and just great! I'm not a huge fan of hawaiian food bug his place is just super good. I will definitely be coming back many times and of course recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Food always comes out perfect! The staff are always friendly. 

However I've tried their new boba drink, while the drink is good, the actual boba is pretty hard. 

Also while most of the food portions are pretty generous, the garlic shrimp plate doesn't have a lot of shrimp. 

Overall I like coming here rather than LnL, just start making the ramen burger and ur set haha."}
{"text":"After the demise of the undersung Aloha-A-Go-Go, this became the default neighborhood Hawaiian BBQ spot.

Too bad the menu is much more limited and the ingredient quality isn't up to par. Not that it was great at Aloha but I've encountered some really vile pieces of meat here.

I guess you could say the chicken was foul.

Thank you very much. I'll be here all week. Try the veal."}
{"text":"Its was roughly 2PM and my expecting wife was jonesing for quiznos so we headed to the one off of Blue Diamond by Target and to her surprise and my relief that location had been closed... So I got the classic long sigh and drawn out \"where do yoooooouuuu want to go?\" I looked up and like a unicorn in the winter, there was ohana Hawaiian BBQ. Okay well that was a little dramatic but nonetheless it was there. 

I am a fan of L&L so I decided there is no way that this place can be bad, it is Hawaiian Barbeque.  We walked in and it was packed,  After looking over menu I ordered my regular from L&L, The Chicken Katsu Plate. You get a large amount of chicken 2 scoops of white rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  Now, unlike L&L where they lay one layer of chicken on a puffy bed of cabbage, at Ohana they lay one layer of chicken on a puffy bed of ........Chicken.  The quality was awesome, the quantity was awesome and the price was impressively low.

Everytime I see the word Ohana I cannot help but think of Lilo and Stitch and that Ohana means Family, and that nobody gets left behind or forgotten. In this case Ohaha Family Barbeque means: Hunger, It will be left behind and forgotten. I will be back to try some of there other options."}
{"text":"This place is my life. When I'm off my diet all I want us to gorge myself here and sleep it off the rest of the day.  Katsu and shrimp curry are ridiculously delicious, as well as the mahi mahi...and I always grab a spam masubi on the side. 

You can order online and pick up... Say what? Awesome."}
{"text":"First of all, VERY clean! I know this place is still new and the location is right off Rainbow Blvd which is convenient! I also love the fact that there's an electrical outlet on the wall directly next to each table. The customer service was also a positive attribute. Not too fancy, but also not to dirty like some of the other Hawaiian chain places."}
{"text":"Tasty food, generous portions, excellent prices, quick & friendly service. No complaints, I have never had a bad experience here and have always enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Called in an order for pickup since I was around the area dilly dallying at Target... Hadn't eaten anything all day and they said my order would be ready in 10 minutes... Once I got inside, I saw a familiar face. The cashier I knew from somewhere else and struck up a conversation with her... As we were talking I noticed the menu from Ohana's Noodle Resturant right in the same building. My eyes got big and I was excited to see that they had Pork Soup Dumplings!!!  Since I already ordered from the Bbq section and was still waiting for my order, I went to the other side and ordered more food... Of course I got the dumplings and ordered Steamed Pork Belly Buns... I couldn't help myself!!! Lol (don't judge me..) I love food!!! 

The Pork Soup Dumplings and Steamed Pork Belly Buns were really good!!! The Bbq Mix Plate was also tasty!!! I will definitely go back and try the Noodles and the Porkchops that I seen that looked good... I like this place.... Good location with lots of stores to go to..."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Curry here. The Chicken Katsu is really good too. The restaurant is really tiny but the food is so good. I usually just order it to go."}
{"text":"Lots of options you're torn between Hawaiian and Chinese food.   Be aware their menu has a large selection ... variety of rice, noodles, meats, and seafood. The service is quick and food is consistent and the portions are fair.  I've never had any complaints coming here.  I definitely enjoy their Thai tea with boba, but I've never tried any other drink besides that.   Perfect place when you want to grab a quick lunch for party of one or dinner for the family."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Great portions for price so far 1st time I ordered Regular Chicken Katsu about $8 for my two young kids & it was more than enough & it was ono. 2nd time had to come back to get the boba deal & ordered the mini Kalua Pork, BBQ mix, and boba (BOGO deal when you check in) = approx. $25. Cashiers both times have been pleasant. Oh & I love that they have charging stations in almost every sitting area!!! Will be back. +GBJ+"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and I enjoyed their BBQ beef however their chicken Katsu (white meat) was very dry and some pieces where chewy.  I grew up in Hawaii and most places that serve chicken katsu, use thighs.  The katsu sauce also tasted odd."}
{"text":"This place was not good at all. The service was friendly but the food was just weird. Everything had an off taste to it and I couldn't even finish my food, plus it was pricy!"}
{"text":"The service was very good, ordered food and it was delivered to the table with in 10 minutes. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and it came with two scoops of rice. It was very good and the serving sizes where very reasonable. It's definitely a place I would recommend to anyone and yes I will be going back again."}
{"text":"Bbq salmon bowl, gyoza, and shrimp tempura is worth every penny.  They also have Thai iced tea, Hawaiian and Chinese food items to choose from.  One of the best teriyaki bowls I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for really good comfort food. Love their mix of pan fried noodles, local plates or pho. Everyone is so nice and welcoming with such quick service."}
{"text":"I love this spot for take out.  Great food at reasonable prices. Friendliest staff and easy online ordering. Nothing fancy, just delicious food."}
{"text":"When this place first opened on the Southwest side, I was stoked!  There weren't many Hawaiian style restaurants that I knew of at the time in the area.  Most places I remember were far off with Ross J's, Hawaiian Hale (closed down) and LnL's =/.

When Hawaiian Hale closed down, I was deeply saddened to learn that the most authentic place I know would disappear.  Later I was relieved to discover Rice Trax, Island Style and best of all, Island Flavor.  I have yet to try out Kauai Grill.

The best part about Ohana's is their convenience due to their proximity to the home, and especially the gym (walking distance).  You can't go wrong with the barbeque chicken and the Hawaiian plates are pretty generous.  Lately, the dishes have been getting skimpy these days and now they have been incorporating a grip of Chinese dishes and believe the owners are most likey...Chinese.  

One thing to be aware of is that if you are used to traditional Japanese curry, just know that the katsu curry incorporates more of a coconut based \"thai-style\" curry, not my favorite.  But their BBQ chicken is always a hit and the fish dishes ain't half bad.  I do like their mac salad, probably because its creamy and heavy with the mayo.  I am not a fan of dryer mac salad types.

Mixing and matching is pretty flexible as well and if you need a quick lau lau or kalua pork fix, this place can curb your craving without having to go hella far.  I do wish they had some deserts, but its pretty decent for what they got.  Loco moco and hamburger steak is handmade and not frozen patty's, which is a plus.

So if you are in the mood, this place is convenient and fast.  Staff is friendly and accommodating as well.  I don't know of any signature dishes, but its overall a good place.   Okay, i am getting redundant and stretching this review...that is all."}
{"text":"I love their 5 dollar chicken katsu and teriyaki chicken specials!

EDIT : This special no longer exists here..not as good a deal as it used to be =p  reduced to 2 stars due to a big loss of value"}
{"text":"Very tasty stuff and fairly authentic. A lot of food, I had the bbq mix plate and couldn't stop eating it! Fair prices as well."}
{"text":"I have only had the Chicken Katsu from here, but it is FABULOUS!!  All white meat, and portion size is insanely large!  Really a great deal for great food!"}
{"text":"Really caught off guard by this little place.  Never even noticed it before and have driven past it so many times.  It has a family restaurant feel and the servers are genuine.  I ordered the Loco Moco which is a traditional Hawaiian lunch plate.  The wife ordered a curry noodle dish.  We shared a starter of soup dumplings.  

The food was fresh, hot, flavorful, and true to the origins.  I don't normally think of a Hawaiian and Chinese restaurant being combined but it just works.   When you are looking for honest and fresh comfort food, look no further than this squeaky clean place.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great value!   Large heaping plate of food for ten bucks.   The loco moco is one of my favorites.  Rice, two hamburger patties, smothered in gravy, topped with two over easy eggs with a side of macaroni salad.  Good stuff!    Not fancy as you will be eating out of a Styrofoam tray with a plastic fork.  You get your own fountain drink from the machine but you will leave stuffed with tasty hot vittles for 11 bucks.   What a great deal."}
{"text":"Very good Hawaiian food. It is close and it pleases. The Kalbi ribs are tasty!

The service is alright aside from the cook who always stares me down. I think he wants to have my babies.

I would suggest avoiding their Chinese food; it is nothing special."}
{"text":"It makes me feel bad when I criticize small, family-owned establishments.  On the other hand, fellow Yelpers also deserve to know about my experience as it might help someone avoid frustration and disappointment.

1)  Do not go there expecting it to be quick.  It took 22 minutes for my order to arrive and it was a very basic order -- a BBQ chicken bowl and a musubi -- which are staples at a place like this.  It was painfully slow and for no apparent reason.  There were 2 people ahead of me in line when I got there.  There was nobody else waiting around for food.  They had been open about 15 minutes.  

2)  Re customer service.  I stood there waiting and was obviously getting antsy, but received no acknowledgement.  Instead, the lady at the counter avoided eye contact with me.  Finally, after more than 15 minutes, I asked about my order, thinking maybe they'd forgotten it.  She curtly told me that mine takes awhile to cook (really, a chicken bowl?) and it would be coming soon.  After 5 more minutes, she finally handed me my bag, without saying a word.

3)  The meat on the musubi was the thinnest I've ever seen (of hundreds, if not thousands, that I've eaten in my life) and it was overcooked.  Fail.  

4)  The chicken bowl was okay.  Tasted like your basic chicken bowl.  Not a lot of chicken, though.   I wasn't expecting much since it was a bowl and not one of the plate lunches, but still, it was pretty skimpy.  Enough for me, but if you're hungry, be forewarned.

Overall, despite my love of Hawaiian BBQ, this was a bad experience.  But I suppose if you're in the neighborhood and craving it, and you have a lot of time and low expectations, it would be okay."}
{"text":"I ordered a noodle bowl and some breaded shrimp. The bowl was small and barely had noodles. The breaded shrimp was dry, hard, and tasteless. This place was a waste of money and I left hungry. The food is better next door at the 808 sushi place or at Hawaiian Flavor."}
{"text":"* I go to this Hawaiian restaurant ALL the time. Whenever someone asks me what I want to eat, I automatically say \"Ohana\". I'm not exaggerating when I say all the time. I sometimes have Hawaiian 3x a week. The location of the restaurant is very convenient so it's probably the reason why it's my go-to place. 

* I usually order the Beef Rib BBQ but from time-to-time I get the chicken BBQ. The portions are quite big and it comes with veggies on the bottom and the macaroni and rice on the side. I honestly have no idea what I would recommend because they're all pretty good. I'm not sure if it's the BEST Hawaiian but it sure does satisfy me. Although, If you're looking for great katsu curry, I would recommend Zen curry. For BBQ, this place is for you. 

* The price is pretty good actually. For one plate of Chicken BBQ, I paid around $8. 

* I would I go again? Yes, and have been. 

* Rate: 7.5/10
* Price: $"}
{"text":"I love this place. We usually frequent the \"noodles\" side of the restaurant, although you can order from both menus on this side. The restaurant is clean, service is great, and the staff are all attentive to needs (i.e. filling water cups and chopstick vs. forks). We always order the crispy kau gee or the shrimp spring rolls, a chicken udon stir fry, a minute chicken cake noodle, a loco moco, pho, ramen, or a general chicken. The kau gee and shrimp spring rolls are great starters, both with great sauces that enhance the taste of the food. The ingredients for all of the dishes that I have had are fresh, and the soups are really good! You can request any type of noodle that you want, not necessarily the ones that come with the dish, which is a nice touch.

If you like quality, good price, and good portions, then I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of my very favorite \"hole in the wall\" places to eat! I always order the honey walnut shrimp and Manapua. I have never had better anywhere else. The hubby orders the BBQ chicken plate and my son loves the chicken cutlet with gravy. Even the saimin soup is delicious! 

Honestly, I could order everything on the menu and never have a bad plate. The service is friendly and helpful, and the portions are large, so you will have leftovers. For the price, you cannot beat Ohana!"}
{"text":"Went here on 06/06/14 to grab two plates of BBQ mixed plate to go. My buddy Gil was coming over for movie night and it was just too dang hot for me to cook so... Ohana it is (was!) 

No joke, at almost 5 PM, it was more than 100* F outside. I was sweating bullets when I pulled up. I walked inside and other people were waiting for their to-go orders. I ordered two BBQ mixed plates, paid the $20 bill, and said, \"May I please have a cup for water while I wait.\" The lady at the register said, \"We don't have water.\" WHAT?! We live in a hair dryer in Vegas - hot, dry and windy - and you don't serve water?! What is this cruel world coming to?

Now, for those of you who don't like sweet drinks, like myself, don't think you're going to get away with getting an unsweetened tea or something from the drink fountain. Every drink is sweetened. For shame! I did notice that they have bubble tea, thai tea and 8oz bottled waters in a little fridge that they store half and half in, but I'm not quite sure if those are for sale. If they are, really? Somebody can buy a cup for unlimited fountain drinks but not unlimited water? This, I cannot accept.

Food was decent. I ordered 2 scoops of mac salad instead of 2 scoops of rice, simply because I don't like rice (yep!) and that was no extra charge to sub, which I appreciate.

I noticed a guy came in to order two boba drinks and the lady at the cash register asked him to fill up his cup with ice from the drink fountain, before she filled it up with premade Thai Tea. After watching that (I tried to take a picture because it was so odd) I most likely would not order boba from here.

To save myself from sudden death while waiting, I went and grabbed a water out of my trunk, but it was hot enough to cook a Cup of Noodles without a microwave so meh."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ mix plate for 7.95. Definitely not the best Hawaiian food I've ever had. Short ribs were tasty, chicken was bland, beef tasted like liver. 

There are definitely better island eats in town!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone down really bad. My mom & brother ordered 3 plates to go. One hamburger & fires- the fries were super salty ...  Mix plate with short ribs & katsu chicken with curry. Curry is good. Short ribs BARLEY had any meat. Another mixed plate with ONE piece of mahi mahi, shrimp (it was sooo fried) , & grilled chicken. 

The food used to be good .. Idk what happened.."}
{"text":"Ordered a meal for pickup, went 15 minutes later and after they rang me up realized they never made it."}
{"text":"I love the BBQ mix plate ! The macaroni salad is my absolute favorite. I always ask for double macaroni salad, instead of the double rice and they don't charge more. I like the cashier girls , very nice. The food has great flavor.  One of my favs for sure ! Try them , you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like driving to island flavor so I decided to settle for this instead. As I was eating my take-out at home, I found a full sized fly in my gravy (posted in photos). I should've drove the extra mile to island flavor instead."}
{"text":"Tasty food for sure and a lot of it.  I am a repeat customer and have not been disappointed with any of the choices I've had.  The regular sized plates are big enough to share or have as two meals if you are a leftovers kind of person.  There are many, many plates to choose from and the price is reasonable.  A definite tell you friends place to eat!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and today I ordered chicken katsu at 1 pm. I was waiting for so long when I saw a box on the counter where the cooks put the food when ready. My food was ready sitting there getting cold and I even stood up by the register. The girl working just looked at me and was arranging things by my food that was ready. It was not too busy and there was no reason for this. Sad because the food is pretty good just didn't like this and may not go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their malasadas are amazing. The BBQ mix combo is AMAZING. The spam musubis are always perfect. This is definitely my favorite place to order food from."}
{"text":"Inconvenient service

After picking up my phone order, we found the order to be incorrect. We ordered a mini Katsu Curry, side of fries, and a BBQ mixed plate. We found that the mini plate did not have rice or Mac salad. Keep in mind that the inconvenienced  driving again to pick up simple rice and Mac salad is frustrating enough. When calling to correct the order, I explained this to the woman over the phone, but nothing else was offered other than driving again to pick up rice and Mac salad.  I'll pass at this place if ever I am wanting Hawaiian food again.."}
{"text":"Overall I would say they are in the middle of the pack in terms of Hawaiian restaurants. I had the lau lau and a chicken BBQ masubi. The former was properly cooked and stayed moist, which was nice. The latter was ok, though I wasn't too impressed by the seasoning of the BBQ. The prices are reasonable. It's not a place I would turn down going back to, but I do think there are better options in the vicinity."}
{"text":"I think this is kinda a \"Hawaiian Waffle House\" for those in the know. Pretty basic Hawaiian food, cheap prices, no frills (I got mine for there and it still came in a to-go container). The older woman working the register was friendly. So, while I would've liked the chicken Katsu masubi's katsu to have a bit more meat (it was pretty thin), and while the burger meat in the loco moco tasted like it came out of a frozen package (not sure if this is the case or not), the food was cooked ok, tasted pretty good, and was a good deal, all things considered."}
{"text":"I have tried them all and this is the best Hawaiian food in town.  When I want a taste of home, I go here.  The portions are large and a mini order will fill up most eaters.  The lady taking the orders is very friendly.  Expect a wait during peak meal times, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in this area! The garlic shrimp and BBQ salmon is my favorite. Upon reading reviews I found out that you can get all veggies instead of rice. I like the rice occasionally, but the macaroni salad is a must have!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but I was hangry and annoyed. Ordered online, waited 30 min to pick it up and found out the order wasn't even put in. Better to call in next time."}
{"text":"Kind of annoyed.. I asked to pay more to upcharge to fried rice with Mongolian beef and would not accommodate. She said there's no substitute bu  I wanted to pay more for it and she wouldn't do it. I just left because I wasn't going to argue with something so stupid. I think that if someone will pay extra for something or pay for a side you should do it. I'm a manager at a restaurant and that's not good business"}
{"text":"Great quick lunch spot for those who live around henderson or work around the area. Great prices, great portions and great customer service. The free cream cheese ragoon for orders over $25 is an awesome deal too! What a steal! Thank you Ohana!"}
{"text":"So upon moving into the south west side of Vegas, the only Hawaiian restaurant I knew about was Island Flavor. It wasn't until one Sunday afternoon that my boyfriend came home with food from here and we haven't been back at Island Flavor since. Don't get me wrong though! I love Island Flavor, but Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is in walking distance from my house.

Their BBQ mixed plate is delicious - it's my usual go to order if I'm not wanting anything else. Their chicken katsu is amazing along with their kalua pig. Some people aren't a fan of macaroni salad. I, on the other hand, LOVE MACARONI SALAD. The one from here I on point.

I get really iffy when ordering boba from a non-Asian place so I was skeptical when ordering a Thai tea from here... BUT! I was proven wrong. The Thai tea here is just as good as any other boba place which makes me extremely happy because now I am just walking distance away from fulfilling my Thai tea craving.

BIG TIP: Order ahead of time if possible. The wait here can be very long if you come at the wrong time. I was ordering dinner here for myself around 9 o'clock on a Tuesday night and ended up waiting at least 25 minutes. 

Did I mention how small it is? You add on the possible long waiting time and crowded area. You'll probably be eating your meal with a stranger waiting for their order RIGHT next to you."}
{"text":"Mind you I always get the same thing (Katsu Chicken) Yum-tastic."}
{"text":"This place should not be in business. The Chicken Chow Fun was bland. Some of my noodles looked clear, it looked like the dish wasn't mixed all the way. The wonton soup was also bland. The Spicy Wonton was disgusting. When you spend $30 you expect good food..instead it we got trash. I  can't believe people actually think this place is legit. We ended up throwing the food away in the trash, because that's what it was, trash. Never again!"}
{"text":"One of my go to spots on my side of the town for the past 4 years. Very quick and very easy to order because most of the items I've tried here are delicious!  

The staff are usually friendly and very welcoming no matter how busy they are. The restaurant is spacious even when it's peak hours. 

Every time I go here, I usually order my usual unless I want to try something different since they have a lot of pictures and items posted on their walls. What's my usual? Chicken katsu curry and salt and pepper pork chop. Usually when I go here I order the mini and I still can't finish it. But a regular is usually good to share with someone so you can try different things. Keep in mind, their portions are decent. Usually good to share family style. 

Their chicken katsu curry is to die for. Always yummy and never a disappointment. Chicken katsu is always warm and crispy and instead of katsu sauce, it's curry sauce.  I love the curry sauce so much that I order extra sauce on the side hahaha. What can I say, I love curry! Oh it it comes with mac salad and a side of rice. Their salt and pepper pork chop has a lot of meat on it every time I get it, barely any bones which is ALWAYS a good think. Good amount of salt on it as well. 

This will always be my go to spot for Hawaiian on my side of the town or whenever I'm craving that awesome chicken katsu curry. Oh, and also a side of guava juice too. Never had a disappointment which is why I rate it a 5 for the past years I've been here."}
{"text":"I like how place looks but the food is alright. It wasn't like \"omg it's so good\" needs improvement on the food. The portion sizes is a lot, which is good thing but it just taste dry."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood of Ohana and wanted good food fast; not fast food.  We ordered the reg. Chicken Katsu plate, bbq chicken plate and the teryaki bowl.  All were good and had more than an ample amount of food.  I will go out of my way to frequent this restaurant when I crave Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"First time trying Ohana BBQ the food was very good and the people working there were very nice! I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"UPDATE! 3/29

This place is in my backyard so I keep going. I've found a staple that warrants a better review: garlic shrimp! 6/5 stars. Awesome. Also the older lady who rings up the orders is super nice. Spam musubi is still delicious, and the short ribs are good too.

Overall after a shakey start this place has won me over.

--------

Admittedly I don't have a ton of experience with Hawaiian food, but when The Egg and I has a better Loco Moco than a dedicated Hawaiian place, there's a problem.

I've been here 3 times. The very first time it was 9:20PM and as I entered the open door, I was stopped by a young girl:

\"We're closed\".
I looked at my watch. 9:20. I looked at the sign, pointed, and said, \"The sign says you close at  9:30.\"
\"We're closed\".
\"It's not 9:30.\"
\"We're closed\".
I left.

4 months later I gave them another chance. The Spam masubi was great, although how you mess one of those up, I'm not sure. The Loco Moco was OK. The brown gravy was the problem. Flavorless. The eggs and patties were passable. There was an enormous amount of rice. So if you're in it for the rice and rice alone, this is your place.

A week after that I had a Loco Moco at The Egg and I on Rainbow and it was way, way better. So yeah. I would expect a Hawaiian place to do a Hawaiian staple better than a breakfast place, but evidently not in this case."}
{"text":"Ohana has kept me intrigued. I have tasted the Chicken Katsu, the BBQ Beef and the Spam Masubi. All are quite tasty. I cannot wait to taste other items off the menu. 

Chicken Katsu - I know this might sound weird, but this was probably the healthiest tasting Chicken Katsu I have ever had. I think it was the quality of the chicken and amount in each bite. I am used to a katsu that is mainly breading, so this dish was different from the rest. The dipping sauce was awesome. It leans towards the sweeter side which is a plus in my book.

BBQ Beef - The marinade for this dish was on point. It was DELICIOUS. I couldn't get enough of it.

Spam Masubi - I need to find out the recipe of the sauce the Spam was dipped in. It was extremely good.

I will for sure be coming back. I think next time I will try a pork item."}
{"text":"love the bbq chicken plate. will feed you for a couple of days and its tasty. and you cant go wrong with the prices!!!"}
{"text":"It's Monday night and I'm glad I read most of the Yelp reviews, cause I made sure to order ahead of time!

I ordered around 6:15pm, dropped my kids off at basketball practice and drove straight on over to Ohana Hawaiian BBQ! 

Parking - there's plenty of spots ... 

Zipped in - paid the little old lady and she was very nice. 
Even had my order waiting. 

Got home and was craving my garlic Shrimp plate!

By the way the price is reasonable..$8 a plate.

I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian BBq at its best. Love their hawaiian food and especially their chinese food. They have many selections to choose from the famous loco moco to salt and pepper shrimp and more. Big food portions with great taste. Nice and clean place to eat. Cooks are very good at producing great tasting island food and chinese food, best of both worlds. Good eats for good prices."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ chicken plate and it was delicious! The customer service and the atmosphere is awesome, I will definitely be coming back, a must try!"}
{"text":"I think I just had the best lunch I can remember in a long time.  If you sit in the dine in section which is the left door you get a bigger menu with Pho and Oxtail Soup.  The right side door is the usual take out Ohana BBQ.  Today I had the grilled pork belly with radish sprouts awesome sauce and folded rolls it's in the appetizer section but was filling for one person.  The plate presentation was really nice didn't expect that at all.  The service was friendly and they work the room together to make sure the experience is excellent.  They feature 8 different types of noodles.  Thanks"}
{"text":"All I gotta say is the little old lady always at the register is so welcoming and warming. 
The food most definitely reminds me of home. 

Price is reasonable with quite a good amount of proportion. Gets busy at times so there might be a little wait, but it's always worth it to wait."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and knowledgable. The food was hot and the portions were great for the price. The katsu sauce was super watery but full of flavor. My only real complaint is the container for the regular sized food does not have compartments so when I got home the rice, chicken and Mac salad had all mixed together. Luckily I like it like that."}
{"text":"Egh...maybe double egh...my GF suggested this place and she arrived a good twenty minutes before I did and was better prepared to place an order. I'm guessing that's why her meal was better than mine although not by much. Enough chit chat let me get to it.

My GF was upset I was 20 minutes late. So I didn't spend too long studying the menu. I saw seafood combo and ordered that without reading everything was battered and fried. In fact there was more batter on my seafood than seafood itself. So disappointing... As I was sitting there being read the riot act for being late I saw a second menu board with more options to choose from. 

When you walk in look right as it appears the good food/typical Asian fare is listed over there and you want to make a fully educated choice.

The girlfriend ordered a BBQ chicken dish. It had good flavor and portion size. She was kind enough to share a bite or two with me when she realized mine was all batter/ breading. 

They have seating for about 15 or 20 people but I think they really don't want you to stay. We ordered at the counter, said we were going to stay and had a seat. Our meals came out in ten minutes served to us in Styrofoam take out containers with plastic forks? No plates or silverware...definitely not a good first impression that was followed up by an equally poor 2nd impression when my seafood combo came out with 75% bread.

I wasn't expecting the Ritz going into a restaurant located in a strip mall but was still sorely disappointed with their food, their service, and overall ambiance. 

The GF said their was no way we'd be back and I'd have to agree."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. Salmon was tender and juicy with excellent bbq flavor like I have never had before. This place is much better then terriyaki madness. I will return as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Let's just start by saying ... HUGE portions. Maybe it was because it was closer to the end of the night, Maybe it was because we looked hungry, Maybe because Ohana means family and it was all delicious!

We ordered quite a lot:
 - Salt and Pepper Calamari - large pieces with good amount of flavor
 - Pineapple dipping sauce with Fried wontons - the dipping sauce was heavenly
 - Chicken katsu - the same everywhere else I've tried it (which is still good, but not noticeably different)
 - Spam Musubi - Look for comment above ^^

So close to home, A LOT of selection can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is indeed one of my go to spots. The one recommendation I will give you is to call in your order. You will indeed have to wait. Most of the tables are taken by people that are waiting for their food. 

The pricing is great and the food is awesome. I can say that I might have eaten everything on the menu at least once."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. I just moved here and I have been at this place at least 5 times in the last month. Most of the tables are used by people waiting for food not actually eating. So this is not a great place to eat. BUT, the food is off the chain!!!"}
{"text":"Ohana Hawaaian bbq, I believe it is one of the more entertaining Hawaiian restaurants in Las Vegas.  It is located in a competitive location where in n out, del taco, i forgot the Memphis bbq.   This place stands out the seating is split to two sides, the fast side and the slower side but owned by the same owner.  The menu is big and they even have pho here.  Menu is vibrant.  Hawaiian bbq is  on point but the pho was just okay, too much noodle that is why for the 4 stars. The staff are nice, accomodating though.  If i were on blue diamond and Eastern  i would come back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is not too bad. It's not the best Hawaiian food I've ever had, but it's still pretty good. The facility is really clean and feels a lot like a local restaurant i'd see in Hawaii which is a plus. The lady who worked at the front was very kind. The biggest downfall is that it's not the quickest place to eat. Definitely expect a long wait for your food. 
At the end of the day, I'm glad I tried this place out, but I'm not sure it's a place I'd come back to. I would say that there are much better options for Hawaiian food out there."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Hilo. I have been missing cake noodle lately (local Hawaii Chinese food). Found this place on Yelp. The pictures are deceiving though. The actual cake noodle was crispy but also dense, however the gravy for it was terrible. It had no flavor other than straight garlic (where's the oyster sauce?). The broccoli that came with it was bitter.

My wife had the kalua pig, which had an odd color to it. It was lacking flavor. If you want real local Hawaiian food, go to Island Flavor instead."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often and we both love it. It's not the most authentic but you can get some good Katsu or a good Loco moco. I often come here on my lunch hour since it's close by. Only recently they started a new $10.00 purchase minimum on credit cards. Since I come alone I never hit that mark and refuse to order more just to hit it. It's easily a 5 star review otherwise, but until they get with the 21st century I won't be coming here often."}
{"text":"A little family owned place with amazing food. I love coming here as often as I can. The staff is also always so nice."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's my pregnancy taste buds, but my kalbi had no taste. Their chicken katsu was alright so was their macaroni salad and spam musubi. :("}
{"text":"Don't order on grub hub for here. Order said it was supposed to be at my house by 659 (40 min), at 7pm I get a notification saying that it was finally on its way and the order was supposed to get here by 754 now. I called and the lady did nothing but hang up on me... pathetic"}
{"text":"I remembered seeing this place a while back when I was eating at 808 Sushi nearby. Months later, my husband and I finally decided to try it out for lunch. I ordered the Pork Lau Lau and Kalua Combo with 3 scoops of rice, since I was never a fan of macaroni salad. (And no, I did not eat all that rice, LOL!) The Lau Lau was nice and steamy, and tasted great. However, every time I eat these, I always wish there would be more meat stuffed inside! The Kalua Pork was weird because it was very watery. I am from Hawaii, so I know that it should not be served that way!

I decided to give Ohana another try when I was in the area again. This time I ordered the BBQ Mix Combo (again with 3 scoops of rice). It came with:
BBQ Beef- about half of it was burnt pretty badly. The few pieces I had that were edible tasted good, but the meat came with a lot of fat. 
BBQ Chicken- full of flavor, cooked just right, and easy to eat. It was the best part!
Short Ribs- the meat was kind of hard and it was pretty flavorless.

The restaurant was clean and the employees were very polite. Overall, I think they are about the same as L&L. If I ever come back here, I would only order the BBQ Chicken plate!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I almost always stick to my usual, the Manapuas (pork inside of a steamed bun) and the Kalua pork. So, SO good.

 The portions are beyond huge, you can easily share one \"meal\" between 2 people or have leftovers for at least another day."}
{"text":"Wow, the lunch special for 4.95 is insane.  They have different lunch specials each day, and the quantity is huge, the quality is very good.  

I have eaten at L&L, and I have always been disappointed in the quality of their meat, and the ghettoness of the restaurants.  

Ohana seems to still be small and authentic (like L&L), but it seems cleaner, and the meat quality is higher (Seems like grade B meat, rather than L&L's grade D)."}
{"text":"This place has very friendly staff and not only that they have delicious food! It's such a nice hang out place to relax with friends."}
{"text":"I love the Lau-Lau and the Garlic shrimp noodles. The BBQ combo plate is well recommended if you like BBQ Hawaiian style. Price is reasonable and the serving is Kamaina generous. I like that they have Hawaiian soda available to make your Hawaiian meal authentic. Oh the Malasada is a must have. Staff are friendly with a flair of Hawaiian hospitality."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for fried shrimp.  Always tender on the inside and crispy and tasty on the outside, never greasy.  I also like their chicken katsu and spam masubi
Always generous with their portions and great service.  If you want a little taste of Aloha this is the place to go.

Happy Eating 
xoxoxoxo"}
{"text":"Lunching with my OG Ryan B, we were on the search for something different. I have been to other Ohana locations, but had never tried this location on Eastern. 

I was craving kalbi, so we decided to give this place a try. They have a very extensive menu and plenty of great lunch specials. You can get pretty much every plate in mini / lunch or full size. I came in knowing I wanted kalbi, but I was almost swayed by all the other great options. I eventually went with my initial craving and got the kalbi. 

The food was ready quickly and we grubbed and chatted while we ate. The atmosphere is really nice. Clean and comfortable. I wasn't too in love with the kalbi, wishing it was a little more flavorful, but overall it was still a tasty meal. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll probably be back to try some of their other lunch menu options."}
{"text":"This place scammed my family terribly. The online ordering system doesn't work BUT took our money! They didn't even care to accommodate us. Wouldn't honor our order or reimburse us for the online order that we paid for! I will never order from this place AND I'll be making sure that everyone I know never supports this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed with the quality of food and service that I received from this place. I really wanted to try this place because of the great reviews I've been seeing on yelp. 

Ordered a regular BBQ chicken with a side of extra macaroni. The extra side of macaroni came in a bigger container but when I opened it the macaroni looked like it was just a small spoonful which was disappointing. 

The BBQ chicken portion was on the smaller side and I thought it would be bigger since I opted for the regular size. The BBQ chicken wasn't the best I've had. It was just okay. I didn't even want to take pictures because I was pretty disappointed of the quality and quantity of food. Not sure if I'd come back to try their other options."}
