{"text":"Very very slow here. I waited about 30 mins to get 1 order of rare beef pho. As I walked in I noticed people already waiting and looking impatient. There is a shady looking poker computer game in the corner of the restaurant that seems to attract seedy looking characters. The pho was good once I got it but i won't be returning due to the wait time and the seedy looking clientele."}
{"text":"The fresh rolls are huge and you're getting a huge bang for your buck here. I was very happy with my pad thai (tasted more authentic than other places) and smoothie (they let me add a bunch of stuff including avocado). Definitely recommend! Only 1 star off for slow service but they were really friendly and cool."}
{"text":"The owners and staff are extremely friendly and nice. The place is surprisingly clean, bright and spacious especially for this area. The menu doesn't have an extensive selection of meals as other Viet restaurants but they do have the basics of spring rolls, pho (beef and chicken), pho beef stew, rice and noodles. All food are in the 6-7$ range. They also have a great drink menu with bubble tea ($4)! 

I had the spring rolls today; 4 huge rolls (HUGE) for $6. The fish sauce is great. I will definitely come back again to try other foods!"}
{"text":"They are doing some sketchy businesses here but not my problem. The pho does not taste anything like pho, it should be called something else. Just call it noodle soup with beef perhaps. The place was clean and the staffs seems nice."}
