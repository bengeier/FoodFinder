{"text":"Went in for lent specials at prime time. Ordered about 7:15. Next thing we know, it's after 8 pm and we have been offered multiple beers. Then it's 8:15 and the owner decides that sitting at the bar and drinking his crown royal apple is more important than helping complete the meal that has been waiting for over an hour. We threw a 20 on the bar for our drinks and walked out.  The whole reason we went there is because they were advertising lent specials on Friday night and they didn't want to care about their \"special\" night. Point is, you're gonna advertise, then not give a shit about your clients."}
{"text":"In a word, AMAZING!  
I love the food, I love the service, and I LOVE the prices!  This is one of the few places my husband and I can go and have delicious meal and drinks and not break the bank!  My husband and I found this place a few years ago when a friend of ours invited us to a pig roast there.  The pig was the best we've ever had and we've been regulars ever since!  The outside isn't much to look at and it is kind of a \"dive bar\", but you just can't beat the prices, food or service!  If you're looking for a fancy dinner then this is not the place for you, but if you're looking for a casual place to grab a bite and few drinks while watching whatever game is on you'll feel right at home here!
They have both an American and Serbian menu.  Usually we go for the wings, burgers (Inn Between Burger is heaven on a plate!), & beer and have never been disappointed, but we've never had \"Serbian food\" before, and decided to get a little adventurous and try a couple things today.  I have to say, I was impressed.  Honestly, I can't even pronounce what I ate today (some sort of Serbian burger), but it was excellent and I'll probably order it again!   
This place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Dive bar, Karaoke seems to be happening whenever I'm here, which I don't like.  You get what you pay for, it's a fine place to have a cocktail or 8 on the cheap...  -2 stars for over karaoke penalty.  Wear some ear muffs to drown out the awfulness and hammer some booze.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We used Inn Between to cater for my son's graduation party and everything was wonderful! The owners were so helpful and nice, food was amazing and order was done on time. Excellent service all around!"}
{"text":"Cant ask for better beer and food specials. We love to go for wings on thursday! The serbian food is awesome and the blue collar crowd us just fine by us!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome!!! Would prefer somewhat quieter environment but the food is definitely worth it..."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years.  Got friends together and stopped in.  Bartender had no clue what special was.  Food was not great.  Burger tasted frozen.  Fresh cut fries would be better.  Wasn't impressed."}
