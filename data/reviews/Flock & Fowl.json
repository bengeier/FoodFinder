{"text":"The rudest people work here. Not only did the cashier take 10 min to take our order when we were the only ones in lines, then she proceeded to give us an attitude about it. Maybe they should hire more staff so they can take care of their customers better. Its a shame because we always come here and now we wont be back."}
{"text":"This place is the best hainan chicken restaurant I've ever been to. Their chicken and rice dish is soooo good. The chicken is beyond tender and the sauces that accompany the dish are just an added bonus. I'll definitely be coming here again and again."}
{"text":"F&F was our first stop from the airport on our way to the hotel and boy were we pleased it was :) The restaurant is simple, clean and boutiqe-ish on the inside. We ordered the house special Hainan chicken platter - AMAZING! Fresh, clean flavors and amazing service. We don't have any pictures because we finished the food almost as soon as it was brought out. Will definitely be visiting them again the next time we're in Vegas!   The only reason I took away a star is because they currently don't have a restroom on site so you have to walk outside to use another restaurants facilities."}
{"text":"1st visit - Fabulous food & service.....everything smelled & looked terrific, they obvious take a lot of pride in what they serve.  Looking forward to going back & trying more in the near future!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. This is the type of place Las Vegas was missing. As a frequent traveler to Southeast Asia, and Singapore in particular, Hainan Chicken Rice is something I constantly long for. Imagine my surprise when Flock and Fowl opened just down the street from me.   Let's start with the amazing team. Jenny will remember your name and your preferences, take care of your order, and have a great conversation when she isn't busy with other guests. The kitchen team is hard working and the wait is never long.   The chicken rice is the best I've had outside of Asia. Period. If you miss this food from the other side of the pacific, Vegas has it. I've also had their unique specials, like the chicken katsu sandwich which is superb!   I will keep coming back. Support local. Support delicious. Thank you Flock and Fowl for setting a new standard in town!"}
{"text":"Top notch food and service, hardly had better.  Only knock is the size of the the restaurant, a few times we had to turn around, as the small dining area can't accommodate many at a time.    Everything else is awesome from the food, to the specialty teas, to the service."}
{"text":"Been looking for good Hainan chicken for sometime and I finally found one, yeah! The menu is simple listed on the wall, pay the cashier and just wait till your food is delivered to your table. We weren't extremely hungry and had to grab a bit before heading to the airport by noon. Ordered the #1 Hainan Chicken comes with 3 different sauces which all were good and the Chicken Bao which was fresh n hot. Tasted good with sprouts and wish it had a little more sauce. Glad I ordered the Vietnamese coffee too. This place comes close to what I remembered having over 20 years ago in good ole Singapore. Oh it's only open for lunch."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try Flock & Fowl since it opened but hadn't been able to make it. Finally did and I highly  recommend it. We had the hainanese chicken & rice, chicken Bao buns, and Thai Carmel wings. All were delicious. Small menu, small place but they are executing some really exceptional food. Will be back for sure, hopefully at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place is hidden near the strip and the area seems sketchy, but it's worth the trip to get there. Everyone there was extremely nice and the food was delicious. The chicken bao sandwiches were my favorite."}
{"text":"So good!  Just like the chicken rice we have back home in Singapore.  I hope it stays that way!"}
{"text":"I postponed my drive home to LA to taste what all of the buzz was about at flock & fowl. The Buzz is deserved, I am so glad I stayed in LV for  A couple of extra hours to be there for their 11  am opening. I have a Very good Friend who lives in Singapore - he is third generation Hianese   9.15.16 The menu has expanded. I had the fried chicken skin in addition to the chicken/rice an interesting addition that added a delicious Crunch to the main course. A simple and simply perfect experience."}
{"text":"Very fresh and organic. They have a small menu so their focus is on quality not quantity. I would highly recommend this quaint and authentic place."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and I love their house made ginger sauce. I also love their Carmel chicken wings and their prices are really fair"}
{"text":"Talk about the best Hainanese Chicken in Las Vegas. The chicken is perfectly cooked and the Hainanese rice goes perfectly with it. The staff are very friendly and efficient . They even agreed to take a picture with me.  This is a place to try when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The hainanese Chicken rice is a very well designed and good tasting dish. The texture of the chicken is chewy in a very good way. The chicken bao is a wonderful mixture of crispiness(the chicken) and softness (the flour shell). The chicken wings are juicy and as spicy as we expected. Overall we very much enjoyed our meal here!"}
{"text":"We spent $25 for lunch for two of us. The food is just ok, not the best. Could get better meal for the price. Will not comeback."}
{"text":"Walked in and it totally reminded me of how Portland restaurants had their ordering system in the back, you order first, pay, then they take the food out to you. But even then, we were greeted upon entering and had a comprehensive explanation of their menu and specials. She even passed with a tray of food pointing at all fb delicious food. It was too cute.  I've ordered the Hainan chicken that came with a trio of sauces, which she explained, I also ordered the chicken bao. Perfectly seasoned, the micro greens gave it a balance in each bite of the meal. Delicious! Just thinking about it while typing this review is making my mouth water. They also suggested to pair the poached chicken with the chrysanthemum tea, and it was on point. She even took time to say goodbye to us as we were getting into our car. This is a place that we'll definitely come back to. We were there when they started at Fat Choy, and now we'll continue to support them with Flock & Fowl.\""}
{"text":"PDX has Nong's Khao Man Gai and now LAS has Sheridan Su's Flock & Fowl. This place can compete with Wee Nam Kee in Singapore. Hainanese Chicken done right with all the trappings for $8.99. I have yet to try the other dishes but definitely worth coming back."}
{"text":"An equisite asian-american fusion experience!!   recommended for whoever is looking for unique cullinary food while in Vegas.  Liz the waitress was super friendly and helpful!   Cheers, Nir."}
{"text":"Great! Small little place but great service. Food is all organic and really yummy! Theres options for different dipping sauces, with the chicken. The kids got the tenders and they were really good. Super friendly too! I will def be back for more!"}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl was a staple in reigniting the food scene in Las Vegas. It's clean, simple, and homegrown family approach to it's delivery has won the hearts of many diners in the valley. With it's early hours and limited availability of food people were literally flocking to this location to get a taste of it's most famous dish.   Food: Flock is famous for one thing and that one thing is done to perfection. The Hainan Chicken with Rice. The best one I've ever had was in Singapore many years ago and this one is probably the closest thing to it within a 500 mile radius. The fact that they took a common street food and made it in as traditional as possible yet uses farm fresh ingredients is genius. Hainan Chicken is a very clean and light dish, and Flock definitely hits these points. The rice isn't too oily but it's packed with flavor from the chicken oil. The poached chicken is also not too oily and not dry but instead soft and tender to a point it melts in your mouth. Sauces are the traditional parings with the marinated cucumbers being extremely fresh. The Farm Fresh Organic egg is also a great add on to the dish as it fills in something I never thought was missing when eating Hainan chicken.  It's hard to comprehend the simplicity yet delicacy of this dish but just know that this is definitely as good as it gets when it comes to Hainan Chicken.   It's odd location and small interior is reminiscent of many restaurants in the boroughs of NYC or Los Angeles. If it wasn't for Flock not many people would be in this shopping center especially at the time it opened. But the draw of good food has the ability to draw people from all types of places. The fact that Flock has made it's name off of this simple yet delicate dish is of course remarkable and it is definitely a must try no matter where one is coming from."}
{"text":"Great friendly service. The food is outstanding. The Fat Choy is also a must visit."}
{"text":"The original poached chicken was like velvet - it definitely lived up to expectations.  The roasted spring chicken was equally good - very tender and juicy, and the skin was perfectly seasoned and crispy.  And the RICE! Those three items were the star of the show.    The buttermilk fried chicken tenders and the chicken wings were alright, more like backup dancers.  My only complaint is the lack of a restroom.  The place is an \"order at the counter and get a number\" establishment, but it is located in a very small strip mall away from Las Vegas Blvd without much around it.  We were told that the cigar shop next door had a restroom but the folks there were (understandably) not happy about us using it.  I would give them one less star but didn't because I would chance a potty accident for some of that chicken and rice.  But c'mon, give us a restroom!"}
{"text":"Make sure to go when they aren't catering a lunch.  They seem to forget about their patrons inside the restaurant as your order will take a back seat.  Totally understaffed knowing they have a large order and patrons in the restaurant waiting over an hour for their food.   And the worst part is they blame the lack of service on the large order..... Like that's our fault.  Great food but horrible service."}
{"text":"Slow service. My order was ready and waiting. They didn't give it to me until I asked for it. Vietnamese coffee is overpriced, don't get it."}
{"text":"I looooovvveeeee it !   I was lil bit scary outside neighborhood .....  But inside of restaurant is so clean and comfy ...   And their organic chicken rice taste so gooood !  I ordered side sunny side egg too !   I haven't back to this place yet but anytime i will go back !"}
{"text":"Looked forward to give this place another try because it was so good the 1st time. This time we ordered the same thing and it was not as good as the first time. The Hainan chicken rice was bland and the chicken bao was way too dry, normally my kids would go crazy over anything fried and they didn't seem to enjoy it as much. I ordered the chrysanthemum tea and it was too watered down, no flavor. Too bad we were disappointed this time with the food but the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Simple concepts that are perfectly executed, including the drinks!  Find this wonderful hole-in-the-wall, and enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"The wife and I visited Flock & Fowl on a Thursday during lunch time.   Poached chicken rice- The rice was excellent, fragrant and not too oily. Condiments provided complemented the chicken and rice well. I had to have a 2nd serving of them. Added an order of soup which was hot, comforting and more flavourful than what we were used to.   Bao- Tenders were a bit dry. Bao was fluffy.  Chicken wings- The Thai wings were a bit too salty for our tastes.   Service- Impeccable. Food was served quickly. Always pleasant, young lady who took our order was flexible and allowed me to add on the soup after our chicken rice was served. (Paid for soup at the end)  Verdict- F&F's poached chicken rice compares favourably to Singaporean versions we are used to. That alone is worth four stars. The service provided tops it up to five."}
{"text":"Came here with friends and ordered #1,#3, Thai wings, and indo fried rice. I had #3 and didn't really liked it. The chicken was bland. I liked the Thai chicken wings tho. My friends really liked theirs."}
{"text":"I love this place! The decorations are very cute! The restaurant is kinda small though. Not that many tables, but there are benches you can sit down on inside to wait for a table. The food was amazing and yummy. As we ordered the waiter explained about how their chickens are fresh and organic. The chicken is the best! The cook even came out to greet everyone and asked if they like the taste of the food! Delicious sauces, the rice has a good kind of seasoning, and everyone working there was nice! The food was placed neatly and perfectly on the plate. I would consider going again with my friends to let them try the food! The plates were even adorable."}
{"text":"Good chicken. Get the chicken stuff, aka all the stuff. The bao is definitely worth it and I got the roasted half chicken with rice. The dipping sauces it came with were excellent. Came here on a chance that they had good Yelp reviews and did not regret it. If I'm back in Vegas again I'd definitely stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"Good Stuff. Got the Congee with all the sides, very good. The Sambal wings we very tasty.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been longing to try this place and finally I made it happened today! I ordered hainanese chicken rice and the chicken is soooo tender! The portion is good enough for a person! There was one thing I was impressed, I think it was the owner or just the cashier, she addressed me using my first name!! It showed how much they cared about the diner! Thumbs up! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying if it weren't for the poor service I would have gave this place a 3 star based on food alone. The woman (Jenny) taking the orders, seating and serving people was \"High Stress.\" Although polite, her anxiety level ruined the atmosphere. I think all customers would rather wait a few minutes then deal with a high stressed server. The pictures and presentation of the food was amazing although the food (at least what we ordered) either lacked flavor or was overly  sauced. The fried chicken bao buns were dry and the chicken pieces were to large and unevenly cut for the size. This place has a nice idea but not executed well. The menu is up front or on the wall which was confusing and then Once you realized you had to order in the front you are rushed to order which the leads to likely ordering the wrong items and don't expect the server to give you any suggestions unless you want them to basically bombard you with the whole menu rather than an actual suggestion. I don't need to say anything more about rice that costs 4.00...yes rice. My general rule is that any Asian restaurant that need to charge for rice is going in the wrong direction. Wasn't horrible but don't need to go back."}
{"text":"The chicken rice is so good and the best I have had in the US! Reminds me of the chicken rice back in Singapore... Their recipe has its origins from Boon Tong Kee chicken rice in Singapore. Must try in Las Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype - legit chicken rice as good as in Singapore!"}
{"text":"This is the spot. It is such a hole in the wall off the strip.   We got there a couple minutes before they opened and the staff invited us in so we didn't have to wait outside. Then she explained the whole menu thoroughly to us. We ordered at the counter and picked a table.   The food is INCREDIBLE. My boyfriend and I loved everything we ordered.   Hainanese Chicken (poached): The chicken is extremely tender, moist and perfectly cooked. The chicken is definitely the star of the dish, simple yet delicious. Three homemade sauces ( scallion/ginger, thick soy, sambal) highlight the simplicity of the dish.   Baos: Similar to the peking duck but replaced with a deep fried chicken. The chicken is so moist/ crunchy and pairs well with the greens. The bao was fluffy and sweet. Yum.  Chicken wings: Sriracha honey. Finger licking good.   The overall experience was fantastic. The food was delicious and felt of high quality. We tasted how much the chef cared about making good food.  This will be our first stop next time we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Have a flocktail! Hainan chicken is a simple yet elegant dish. Jenny gives you great intro info to southern Asian food.  Service is on point"}
{"text":"Great food and a trendy setting - the truffle oil and duck noodles were stellar. It would be nice if they added more teas, though."}
{"text":"Anything you order here is done to perfection.  It's refreshing to find a small local place in Vegas that is good and uses organic meat and good quality vegetables.  The owner works along side her staff providing friendly and great customer service. I go every time I get a chance, and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Great lunch!  Get there early to avoid having to wait for a table.   Something to be said for doing one thing and doing it great."}
{"text":"I just love coming to eat Sheridan's cooking.  As usual, he never faila to deliver an excellent dish.  The Thai Caramel wings are excellent. My brother is now a convert."}
{"text":"Finally! A legit hainan chicken restaurant in Las Vegas.  Had nong kao in Portland and grew up with savoy my entire life, and flock and fowl lived up to the expectations. Chicken was super tender, rice was moist and flavorful, and the prices are very reasonable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a gem! Came here for dinner and cocktails and was thoroughly impressed! Adam the bartender took great care of us and makes some awesome drinks! I highly recommend the lychees knees cocktail and the downtown farmers organic salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an amazing dinner here the other night, we wer fans of the Sahara location and were excited to see the downtown expansion.  We sat at the bar and had great cocktails and the food was so good! Honey butter wings every time. Deviled eggs every time."}
{"text":"Great food and great service is a combination you don't often see.  Flock and Fowl have it in spades! I was here when \"Julie\" was in and she was irrational and demanding.  I thought the staff was patient to a fault but there wasn't any satisfying her.  Disregard the negativity, come with an open, patience and a love of great food and you will love it.  Sorry it took a negative for me to finally leave a review but it needs to be said.  Great addition to downtown eating....keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of hospitality. Jenny works the floor and is always super attentive. Great customer service.   I will definitely come back to try the wings. The hainan chicken rice is just amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is where you go if you have any pride. The buns are phenomenal and the care that goes into each order is obvious. Authentic as hell and tasty as well. The fried chicken is better than the poached."}
{"text":"In Vegas for my bf's bday and we were both in the mood for something savory.   I LOVE rice, so I was really excited to try the chicken flavored rice...it's amazing. It did not disappoint.  10/10 would recommend. Wish they had a spot in LA!"}
{"text":"I just had the Hainan Chicken Rice two days in a row and I still want more! That's how good it was. The chicken is super tender and the skin is my favorite part! It comes with deboned half dark half white meat. I really wish I can pick between dark meat or white meat - I personally liked the dark meat so much more! The three sauces that come with the dish are super good - hot sauce, ginger sauce, and sesame soy sauce. But if you like a sweeter taste, you should request the sweet soy sauce. I like to put all four sauces on the chicken and the rice, super yummy combo!   The prices are a little steep - the Chicken Rice is $8.99 then $1.99 extra for Chinese sausage. But they do use high quality ingredients!   Beware that this place is not that fast if you are in a hurry or want to pick up to-go quickly. It took ~20-25 minutes to order and get our food. Right now it seems like it's just the two owners that work here, and Jenny (one of the owners) is taking orders, delivering food, cleaning up tables, and packing up to go food. Given how popular this place is getting, they probably need to hire some help soon!  I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Liz and Amber were the best! They ran out of the hainan rice, but Liz ended up giving up her plate that she ordered for herself for lunch. They knew we came out from out of town just to try it. The chicken was tender and the sauces went with the chicken very well. I will definitely come back to get this again. The girls said they usually run out by 2pm. Come early!"}
{"text":"Juicy chicken goodness. Probably the best hainan chicken I've had in the states. Cocktails were also delicious. Don't sleep on the quinoa broccoli salad and the laksa."}
{"text":"Tried this place over the weekend. Ordered an appetizer to test it before we had dinner. Edamame and cracklings. They were awful. Cool and clearly old edamame. The cracklings were cold too and very chewy. Never had them before but the name doesn't stack up... I think the owner or the manager was sitting at the bar. She seemed more interested in drinking with a bunch of guys than how her customers were doing. Sad that there isn't a good place where Itsy bitsy use to be. Downtown could really use the help. Save your money for some place else."}
{"text":"It is better than advertised.  Especially after eating in the overpriced hotels on the strip.  The taxi ride from your hotel is the most expensive part of lunch."}
{"text":"Went there with 5 other folks. Good food. We all got the Hainanese Chicken Rice. The Chinese sausage and kale side were a hit. I got the broth which was ok but probably won't get it again.    Will definitely come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner and sat at the bar. We sat there for at least 10 minutes and not even asked what we wanted to drink. The bartender would not even acknowledge us. Never even got to eat. We went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a few things. The side rice was delicious so that says a lot about the other dishes. The waitress was very energetic. I would go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Not normally a huge fan of poached chicken, but the Hainan chicken and rice here is not to be missed!  The perfectly cooked chicken is complemented by the house made sauces - sambal, sweet soy, and ginger and scallion.  Dip anyway you like - no wrong way to eat.  Sure, sometimes chicken is just chicken.  Confront the chicken like necessary protein, and savor the chicken fat rice.  So, so good!  I could eat a gigantic bowl of the rice for breakfast, lunch, and dinner several weeks in a row.  Apparently, we have to thank Sheridan Su's mom, Mrs. Han, for the recipe...THANKS!  Menu is simple (today) - Hainan chicken and rice, wings, salad, and fried chicken tenders.  Teas highlight the drink menu.  Try any one of them. Wings are sold by the half and pound.  Not super crispy wings, but perfectly sauced and juicy on the inside.    This place is west of Fat Choy's on Sahara.  It's not the greatest of neighborhoods (pawn shop next door), but who cares?!  It's better food than you can get at a lot of Strip restaurants.  Besides, their current operating hours are during the daytime.  Seating is limited.  There are only a few tables, so when word gets out about this place, we may be in for a wait.  This is okay, too!  Just order take out."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Thanks to Paul for being so helpful in walking us thru the menu. Enjoyed everything. The wings were beyond tasty! Great experience."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall location, but amazing little place with organic choices with focus on chicken.  I always think it's tough to make a special meal from chicken but the entire family loved it.  A must try for locals."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit. The industrial feel in the restaurant is inviting. As for food, I had the laksa.. I'm not sure what prawns are supposed to taste like but it was quite chewy. The chicken seemed a bit overcooked, because it was tough. The curry sauce at the bottom of the bowl was tasty but cold. Maybe it was meant to be served cold, I'm not really sure. I personally enjoy my soups warmer. My boyfriend, on the other hand, had the burger. It was very good. The meat was juicy, and the aoili that came on the side of the fries was delicious.   I'd also like to add that the staff is very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Very flavorful, fresh, quality meal.  If I lived here it would be on the weekly rotation.  The young woman who took our order and served us at table was very pleasant and told us about the region the cuisine comes from.  Get off the strip and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our visit to Flock & Fowl. Don't know if this is what's being served when people talk about \"Chicken Rice\" but this was really good.   Had the signature Hainan Chicken Rice $9.99. They promised and delivered:  Tender, juicy, free range chicken, perfectly poached and sliced. Served skin on with perfect rice cooked with their chicken broth. Loved it just like that but it came with three sauces. Sambal- too spicy for me. Shoyu blend- preferred the plain chicken. Ginger sauce- imagine the best ginger chicken EVER!  Also good:  Thai caramel crispy garlic chicken wings 4pcs $5.99 F & F Salad w/ roasted chicken $10.99  Simple flavors. Simple presentation. No where to hide. WILL be back for the Chicken Rice. Yum."}
{"text":"What a great place.  I love Asian food, and this was fantastic. Keeping to one item, doing it well, the sides, condiments, all add up to a great experience.  The staff was especially nice, not obsequious, but present. Not to downplay Flock & Fowl, but I went there after standing at another, British-type pub-place 2 blocks away, stood for about 15 minutes without even being acknowledged. There were empty tables. So glad I left and went to Flock & Fowl. They do it like it should be done."}
{"text":"This wonderful family owned and operated was so GREAT that we tried to eat there 3 times during our Weekend in Las Vegas. The FOOD and Service were spectacular, yet the prices were inexpensive. We tried the Chicken dinner, the fried chicken Bao, the wings, the  cooked  organic eggs, the salad, the iced tea, and the wings. EVERYTHING was delicious. I especially enjoyed the BAO. They are closed on Sunday( DARN it), so we tried their other restaurant, FAT CHOY, in the EUREKA Casino @ 6th and Sahara. IT too was outstanding. We look forward to visiting Vegas soon and eating at Jenny and Sheridan's  Incredible restaurant."}
{"text":"Jenny and Chef Sheridan are two of the nicest people in the world. Authentic, delicous hainan chicken. I'm talking best of the best; a contender for any hainan chicken you'd find in Asia. Succulent and perfectly cooked. Awesome sauces as well. Don't forget a Vietnamese Iced Coffee! The definition of a hidden gem in LV."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch yesterday. The line was long so I did take out . I still had to wait because everything was made fresh.   I had the Chicken Bao, Indo Fried Rice and the Chicken Wings. Then while I was waiting for the food I ran into so many people. They told me next time I should order the Haninan Chicken and salad. So I will order that next time.   Really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This is so good.  It doesn't look like much when it shows up but got damn.  Chicken rice forever."}
{"text":"Decent food. Limited on their menu. I had the hainan chicken and rice and it was decent, a bit dry but I've had better. Make sure to get the chinese sausage with your dish."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was amazing! The side sauces were so good. From top to bottom is this spicy sauce, miso soy sauce, and garlic chunky sauce."}
{"text":"Finally got to try what everyone was talking about! I normally get hainanese chicken from Noodles at the Bellagio. But this restaurant may be a little more convenient for me! It definitely was full of flavor! I do wish the bone broth came in a bigger bowl! Cause that was so good and I wanted more! The chicken was tender and juicy! The egg was also an added plus!   We also tried the cucumbers, spring rolls and chicken wings! Everything was tasty, but for sure the star of the show was the Hainanese chicken for me! I for sure will be back for that! There were 2 more options to have the chicken..but you can never go wrong with traditional!   The restaurant was very chill and quiet, however we did go an hour before they closed. I saw they had a pretty full bar, and was craving a michelada...so I had asked our server if it was possible to make one. They don't normally have that drink available but were more than accommodating! For that I am grateful! The other server had made it happen and I think he even made them himself! He did a great job! They tasted good! Definitely hit the spot!   I will for sure be back! I keep hearing about how good their brunch is...so that's next on the list!"}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place for along time and finally get to try it for the first time and it was ok, nothing special. Chinatown has better places to eat than here for their ???? Hainan chicken.  It is not my type of chicken ..I wish they would've used free range chicken instead ...sad face so will not return."}
{"text":"Great spot.  My girlfriend raves about this place and brought me by.  She loves the salad with a side of fowl, which was amazing.  I had the fried tenders and rice with an egg on top, which was also great.  I'd highly recommend either.  The owner was working and so sweet.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Location - 4 stars  Small, and small shared parking  Set up - 2 stars Nice rustic decor, tastefully designed.  Very small space.. Total of maybe 6 or 7 tables for 2.  I don't recommend a large group.  We had 7 guests and luckily the timing was right for us, or else I'm not sure how we would dine.  Menu - hard to read, it's on the wall so everyone is crowding the same area.  Specials were scattered in different chalk boards.  Order then sit - this is my least favorite thing about this place. Usually order then sit is for take out driven (fast food) or a large food court with plenty of seating.  Our group and another 2 groups behind us were waiting to be seated (esp when the place is so small, you wouldn't just go sit down on an empty seat, common courtesy) however, the staff tells you to order first, chances are you can order and what if somebody takes the only empty seat as they come in while you're ordering? Are you forced to take your food ToGo? And the line to order is literally right next to our table. If menus were given during the wait and orders were taken at the seated tables, the place wouldn't seem so unorganized.  Staff - 5 stars The waitress we had was energetic and helpful. Also educational with the product.  Taste - 4 stars  Everything was flavorful and tasty.  But not something that blows my mind.  Coming from LA, I am very familiar with Hainan Chicken.   Desire to return - 3 stars Simply because it's been 4 days since I dined, I haven't had the craving or have shared this restaurant with others. Therefore, this place is average."}
{"text":"Hey Yelp, can you add a sixth star? This place deserves it.    One of the most trendy, delicious, down to earth, unique restaurants in the Downtown area. Right when we walked in we were given a warming welcome! Even after we moved tables 3 different times to find good lighting for pictures, they continued to ask if they could do anything to help!   We finalized our seat at the bar! We had spectacular service from the bartender (his names Jose, and he deserves his own rating! I give him a 5/5)! He helped point out the proper direction to go with our entrees and recommended great drinks!   Order recommendations: Wellness shot, Flock Fries, chicken wings (angry sauce and honey butter), Kaya toast, and Hainanese Chicken Rice!   Cocktails: Le Grand and Lychee's Knees   *Happy hour is also daily from 5-7p and 10pm -close and includes half off appetizers!"}
{"text":"Chicken is very good, but I don't know what all the fuss about the chicken rice was?? Chicken skins, killer. Bao,  killer."}
{"text":"Their signature dish Poached chicken is really good. The fried chicken is dry though since it's only breast meat, no fat. We had to wait a little bit, but we could order first, and food came out right after we grabbed a table. The waiter is very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"My friends and I had heard about this place far before it was opened, on some article online (probably by Eater, or someone). After seeing the tons of great reviews, we had decided to try it out for lunch.   I've had hainan chicken in various styles (famous Thai style at Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra, CA) or Malaysian/Singaporean style in various restaurants in different cities.   As this place is owned by the locally well-known Great Bao/Fat Choy, Sheridan and Jenny, its gotta be good !   Upon entry, you are greeted behind the counter by Jenny, rigorously taking orders in person and by phone herself. You go to her to place your order and pay before sitting at a table.  As said, my friends and I had ordered the Hainan Chicken (listed as organic free range chicken) with some of us ordering a side of chinese sausage (random craving). There are also other choices of egg, broth, salad, etc.   The chicken comes de-boned, mix of dark and white meat. Tender and juicy. Rice cooked with chicken oil/fat and broth giving it a nice lift of fragrant flavor and aroma, while keeping each grain of rice nice and firm. Sauces that come with it is the traditional ginger and green onion sauce, sweet soy sauce, and a house-made spicy sauce.   I dont recall where they get their chicken but for one who is used to chinese free-range chicken, it wasn't similar. Generally for a chinese free-range chicken, the meat is firm and \"chewier\" with a fairly deep yellow skin that has a \"crispier\" (i dont know how to explain in english) texture to it.   Chinese sausage is... chinese sausage. Steamed with water or cooked with rice. Cant screw it up Lol  Overall, despite the smaller portion than i had expected (left kind of unsatisfied and still lookin for food), it is probably the best you can get (for what i know) in vegas so far. Location may be kind of sketchy as you need to go kind of on a little detour to get to it off of Sahara if you are going east bound, as it sits on the west bound side without a way to turn in from Sahara.   Open only for lunch for what i know, as the owner and wife opens up their other restaurant at night."}
{"text":"Everything was great.  Had the Hainan chicken, chicken rice and garlic thai wings - and enjoyed them all - particularly the wings.  Service was super friendly and attentive without being intrusive."}
{"text":"hainanese chicken and rice in vegas!!! delicious. they offer other chicken items, including some fried chicken skin, fried chicken wings, and some chicken bao (mantao style). small restaurant space but quick turnover for tables... all in all good experience and great food. glad i dont have to go all the way to LA for Savoy!!! lol."}
{"text":"Super simple concept. It's Hainan chicken and a few other menu items. The Chicken was good but the bao was better. A little overpriced for my taste but it works."}
{"text":"Lovely food and good service even tho they always be busy. Love their chicken dishes, they are really really good. Me n my friends been lucky that we always find a table when we go as many times we see people waiting for table so if u go there, u won't be able to stay for long as people are watching u eating so I love this place, but it's better for a quick lunch than a socialize place."}
{"text":"Great and reasonable spot for lunch if you want to feel like loco. Was recommended by a friend and definitely love it!! Love the Indo fried rice and the traditional plate they have. Healthy, simple and auxin service in and out as they are close 3:30 everyday. Which that's why people are lining up to get in for lunch! Great spot def will comeback again!"}
{"text":"The laksa was delicious. The ambiance is perfect for a casual lunch or dinner. The location is perfect for downtown."}
{"text":"Loved this place and this location but it is now closed and has been re-located downtown in the Ogden building.   You can enjoy the signature chicken rice as well as select beers and cocktails. I love  the Laksa and the Kaya Toast!!!"}
{"text":"So awesome.  So so awesome.  Go in there, get the hainanese chicken rice with an egg and chinese sausage, and call it a day.  Super moist and juicy chicken, awesome flavor in the rice (cooked in the poaching liquid for the chicken I believe)...It's that comfort food you need between all those other high end meals in Vegas.  We came out here in mid-November around 2PM - not crazy full but not empty either.  Food came out rather quickly but man, so worth it.  They also had wings which were OK, and a curry fried rice special which was OK as well.  Just get the chicken and rice, so awesome.  I can keep on saying it and it will always be true."}
{"text":"First time visitor for lunch today.  The quality and freshness of the food is so much more than I would expect from a fast causal hole in the wall restaurant.  The young lady did an excellent job managing the lunch time crowd.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Pretty much the Closest thing to the Chicken and Rice I've had in Singapore. I think it's better that spot in Arcadia I forget the name of it. The service is on point. The only 1 bad is that there's no public Restrooms But it's all good bc the food is so good you'll forget that u needed to pee or poo... Word to yo mother!! We outta here! Peace!"}
{"text":"This is the best Hainanese chicken I've ever had. The chicken is so juicy and tender. The sauces are so flavorful and go so good with the chicken. The chk wings are really good too. The service is great and Heather the bartender kept the alcohol flowing!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Went here on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30pm. Timing was perfect, the place was super chill. Two cocktails ordered off their menu and absolutely beautiful presentation. They tasted just as good! Deviled eggs for an app. Perfect blend of savory and spicy. Entrees had were the rice with the many options and the laksa. Both were beautiful and the tastes were amazing! The service was awesome, so helpful. Everyone was very friendly. The chicken and eggs used are organic so they're on to the clean eating trend which we really appreciated!"}
{"text":"Came to Flock & Fowl for a super late lunch. I ordered their Chicken Rice with Spring Chicken which was a bit dry but still good and very filling. He ordered the Chicken Rice with Buttermilk Fried Chicken which he thought that his portion was too small. We  shared the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Bao and liked it. He also ordered their soy milk and said that it wasn't sweet enough for him, although I took a sip and I thought it was a perfect balance. The service was quick and the staff were all very friendly."}
{"text":"Recommended by some friends and wasn't impressed. Ordered the #1 and their specialty dish is basically traditional Chinese ginger chicken. The rice was made of a chicken broth which made it quite tasty, but the chicken wasn't anything special. For $10 a plate, I'm expecting more than 6 pieces of chicken. Although the chicken was moist, my hubby and I each ordered the # 1. So for $20 we could've ordered an ENTIRE chicken at a chinese restaurant.  The description on the menu said \"pickles and mustard greens\" -- to think that we were getting a side of veggies was naive. They literally served a teaspoon amount of mustard greens and 3 slices of pickles. What a joke.   I'm not one to complain about prices... but I added 1 egg, an order of chinese sausages, and 1 order of chicken skins - all of which was $2/item. My $10 dish became a $16 dish.   The sausage was mediocre. The ones I get at the market is better than the ones served here. The sausage was cut extremely thin and was over cooked -- extra crispy. And the skins were bland and tasteless. Would not go back.   The chicken wings were okay... We ordered half and half. One of which was a bit on the sweeter side and the other was a bit too spicy for me.   The Bao was the best thing on the menu - but the sauce was drenched on the chicken making the bao too salty for me.   The green milk tea was pretty good... but not amazing.   All and all, I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious, amazing, what more can I say??  I have been here for lunch and dinner. I really enjoy lunch here and they have great chicken lunch plates. My favorite is the half hanoi chicken with rice. The plate comes with specialty sauces. I always ask for sriracha sauce on the side and that helps kick things up a bit.  The location is easy. I don't like to spend a lot of time downtown, but since the restaurant is at The Ogden, it's an easy exit from the 95.  Staff is super friendly, I haven't had any service issues.  And I just read that Chef Sheridan Su was nominated for a James Beard award! How incredible is that?? And you can get his food in downtown Las Vegas. That's pretty awesome. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. 3 stars for the experience. The food was really special. Unique flavors and unusual combinations. Reminds me of Indonesian flavors, with an amazing homemade sambal. Cocktails at the bar were tasty.  We sat at the bar and then later at a table. We were the only people at a table for awhile, yet our wine and food took a super long time to come out. Our waiter and the bartender were competent and friendly enough, but both had this weird kind of vibe like they thought they were super cool, like being a little mean was endearing. It wasn't.   The worst part of the experience was that they brought the bill over to be paid on an ipad and the waiter just stood there holding it. We were two couples, and hadn't figured out beforehand if this was a split the bill or someone just getting the whole thing kind of night. We also didn't have a chance to review it to make sure everything was correct. I asked if he could leave it with us to review and he made a comment like, \"wouldn't you like that,\" as if some POS iPad was a big prize we were itching to sneak out in our pockets. I asked for a printed version of the bill and he haughtily replied that we'd get one after we paid the bill. I found it obnoxious.   If they fix the service snafu's and general attitude, this could be a fantastic place. But for now, take out is the way to go."}
{"text":"Wow - such a delicious lunch here at Flock and Fowl! We ended up coming again the next day because it was so good.  The roasted spring chicken and some sort of chicken sandwich were the winners at our table. We also tried the salad and traditional poached chicken / rice.  So good!"}
{"text":"This happened to be the best meal of my vegas trip. Its a small and casual place with great food and service attracting all sorts of guests. The flavor and texture of the fried chicken and hainan chicken were awesome. They have this ginger sauce and spicy sauce that compliment the chicken perfectly."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for the first time, visiting Freemont street late at night. We were craving something different than your ordinary American meal found commonly on the main strip. We found this place very close by and decided to check it out. I am so glad we did. We ordered salt and pepper wings to start and shared the entree Hainanese chicken. The salt and pepper wings were fried to perfection. It had a light yet extremely crunchy batter on the skin while retaining a moist juicy meat. The Hainanese chicken entree included seasoned rice, bone broth, 1 hour egg, bone out white meat and dark meat chicken with 3 dipping sauce. I can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"It was a bittersweet moment knowing that Flock & Fowl was my last meal in Las Vegas before I moved, but it was definitely the best meal to end my stay in Vegas.  I went with a friend and we wanted to try everything! I ordered the wing trio with Thai caramel, honey sriracha, tropical habanero wings, 4 of each. We also got the fried chicken bao, 2 of them, and the poached Hainan chicken with rice.  The Hainan chicken 5/5 - super soft and tender chicken, very moist and delicious! The rice was soft and the pickles were good. The sauces were good and the fried chicken skin was a good add on.   Wing trio 4/5 - Thai caramel wings were my favorite, hands down. Sticky and sweet and soft and crunchy! The habanero wings had a nice kick to them and the honey sriracha wings were sweet and spicy too.   Fried chicken bao 4/5 - crispy chicken, soft bao buns, well seasoned, moist and juicy... I could keep going, they were good!  I am going to make this spot a place I have to come back to every time I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed meals there numerous times.  The food is great(all about chicken) and the staff provides superb service.  In most case you'll find the owner serving the guests.  The young lady that is on staff with them is definitely one of the best hospitality individuals I've experienced.  A five star restaurant of her own is definitely in her future.  My dining experience was at the Sahara Ave location."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short, ordered the chicken rice and the two piece bao. Both were delicious! Definitely returning again."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment! My husband and I had a list of restaurants to hit while in Vegas, and this was at the very top. Our experience was a dumpster fire at best.  We waited 10 minutes without anyone coming to our table (there were literally only two tables sat in the place), so I finally flagged a busser down and asked if he could have the server, who I can see rolling silverware 5 feet away, come by. A few minutes later we are finally greeted by our server who says \"Do you guys know what you want to order?\" No mention of cocktails, no menu tour, nothing. The whole reason we came was to order the \"Son-in-law Deviled Eggs,\" so we ordered those to start. I kid you not, TWENTY MINUTES later the server shuffled over to tell us they were out of eggs. How is it possible in a restaurant with two tables that it took that long to tell us they have no eggs? By this point we had been seated for over 30 minutes and still had no cocktails or food.   I was genuinely ready to leave at this point, but we were starving and decided to stick it out. Here's what we ordered:  Milk Tea Cocktail- interesting flavors and great presentation. Only con was the paper straw that gets soggy and gross as you drink.  Kaya Toast + Foie Gras ($20): the brioche was burnt to a crisp on the first piece that came out, so we had to reorder a new one. The egg on the second one was completely cooked through. It has the potential to be a great dish, but they just couldn't execute.   Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice ($15): I don't get the hype. Cold chicken with white rice and dipping sauces.   While waiting for our food, we heard the only other table in the restaurant send back all of their food for not coming out correctly, so it wasn't just us that had a rough meal. The server offered 10% off at the end, but I would've rather saved the $4 and had the experience we had hoped for. A waste of a meal in a city with a million amazing restaurants."}
{"text":"Dear Flock & Fowl, I visited your place with 8 people during lunch time. You were quite full at the time but we tried to be as flexible as we could. We offered to split 4/4 and wait but you kept wanting us to leave. You said \"why dont you order to go\" and \"sorry you cannot wait or else it gets to packed.\" What a great display of service... NOT."}
{"text":"My party last week was told to wait at opening because, \"we aren't set up yet.\" When seated, my eyes fell upon the dirty spoon, pictured. And the most flavorful item of our two plates this visit was the rice.  That's hardly a ringing endorsement in light of all the other glowing reviews.   The above spoon encounter was my first impression before even ordering, including that our waiter didn't know what the daily specials were (i.e., vegetables). Isn't this what you do when you come into work: find out what the specials are, and know what's in stock and not? To the spoon, when you're sitting their folding that utensil/napkin/plate display, don't you notice that there's cleaning residue on the reflective face? It was the FIRST thing I saw, before my cheeks even hit the seat.   Second-most flavorful was the side of Chinese sausage, but that's a compliment to the fabricator, not the chef, unless they're making their own sausage in-house. If that's the case, bravo.    Finally, they use a tablet to deliver your bill, and to receive your gratuity and signature. This would be acceptable if the tablet was left at your table, but it's presented to you by waitstaff--as if it were a bottle of wine whose label you were checking--so that you can make your tip selection. For all to see.  No discreetness available.  No \"take your time,\" thank you, and appreciation for coming. In fact, we were asked if we were going to stay awhile longer to hang out, though there were plenty of empty tables and no line of customers flocking.  It's a social-pressure game, and I don't like it.   Kudos to the food runner, however, who was sociable, affable, and who noticed I left my computer bag before I'd walked out the door. Dude's got attention to detail and to people's customer experience.  So all in all, and price-point aside, the quality was lackluster. I have had better. But throw in the pricing of these plates, and the sad state of service and basic silverware presentation?  I have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and although the neighborhood is bit sketchy, this restaurant is in between a pawn shop and a wedding shop ( classic Vegas) the food is so good. Order the chicken bun sandwich delicious."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews with this place.   The food was good.   The service was good.  The prices were high for what you got, I had read reviews that even with a limited menu they are always out of menu items and yes, they were out of the fries.  Fries.  And with a limited menu that threw off my order.  I was going to order the wings and fries as my entree and the husband ordering the Hainon chicken number one.    As for the house specialty, while the waiter did say the chicken would be served room temperature, it was served cold and that made the blandness stand out even more.  Otherwise, the meal was good, but still felt something was missing.  My husband ended up ordering a side of the veggies after seeing another customers even though he ordered the one hour egg and sausage as recommended.    My wings were very tasty, but I had to add a cup of the egg soup for $6 to make a meal.   And we both went home feeling we did not have a complete meal and were hungry an hour later.    My husband did rave about the hot tea and again, the service was excellent and the management greeted us throughout.    Not a fan of the swiping my credit card into an iPad. Pet peeve that will also make me uncomfortable and not enjoy my experience."}
{"text":"This Hidden Gem won't stay hidden for long. Right next to the new golden dragon casino on Sahara, it may be a little hard to get to but once you find it you won't be disappointed. The chicken is amazing ! Truly farm-to-table I recommend not only getting the egg on top of your rice but also try some chicken broth as well. Truly the best chicken in Las Vegas and possibly the world!"}
{"text":"We often have to look for a place to grab a bite before going to the Smith Center on a Sunday night. We never want anything too fancy since the meal is not our evenings entertainment. But we want good food, an interesting menu, and attentive service. Flock &  Fowl had it all. Stephanie, our server, was at our table shortly after we sat down to get our drink orders. I was disappointed that they have no draft beers. And the beer I ordered, 21st amendment IPA, only came in a can. I was pleasantly surprised that the beer was actually good and was a nice start to the meal.  We tried the chicken wings, hummus, and baos for our app (you get a free bao with your yelp check-in). The wings came with two dipping sauces, spicy and sweet. I would recommend getting one of each because both were quite good (and spicy was not too spicy for a gringo pallet). The bao was good. It would've been even better if it came with a sweet sauce or something else to moisten it a bit. The hummus was just OK. As an entrée we got the roasted chicken ($15). That was really outstanding. We got sausage and veggies has the side dishes. I like both a lot. We definitely will be coming back. I'm anxious to try the chicken with a traditional preparation (served cold)."}
{"text":"Third time we are here and the best chicken rice I have had in USA so far! Very authentic, very tasty and super flavorful. The chicken is tender, juicy. The rice is fragrant. The chicken wings were also da bomb. The sides were very legit too. It reminds me of my childhood days. Highly recommend for anyone who visit Vegas and want to try authentic chicke"}
{"text":"F&F Sahara and F&F DTLV are distinctly different- I find that I prefer the other location and am anxiously awaiting it's reopening. I've been to this location a couple of times and I'm happy to have it available and it's been great to try an expanded menu of dishes, but the quality of food and service have not been on par with the original.   FOOD PROS: First timers definitely have to get the classic Hainese chicken and rice. That glutenous rice is one of my favorite things in life, it is so flavorful. Add on the Chinese sausage. Most recently, the bang bang noodles were a hit dish recommended by our server- would totally get these again! I love khao soi and the chicken laksa is a similar dish that was decent but not excellent, great for cooler days.   FOOD CONS: Menu was recently changed up, so the son in law eggs I wanted to get are gone and they added a \"black garlic hummus\" that didn't really work with a strange texture but great scallion pancakes. The chicken wings were disappointing for a place named for their chicken- bland in flavor, thick batter, sauces just okay.  Dessert offerings have been expanded but remain underwhelming- overly sweet skillet cookie, average cheesecake, not their forte so get an extra app instead.   SERVICE/LOCATION: Hit or miss across the board. Twice we started with a great server and were later passed off to someone else who was less competent. First visit, no one knew what the daily vegetable was, then what we were served wasn't what we were told, and it was never addressed. However, most recently, Gino was great with a friendly attitude and several suggestions. Payment is by ipad, with someone watching you like a hawk as you key in the tip. Expect paid parking. Focus of menu and service on most recent visit seems to be on bar and I'm not a drinker so maybe I'm just not the target audience?  I'm more likely to return to the Sahara location over this one but am optimistic that things may improve, especially given their seasonal menu changes and a rumor that bao will be back soon. When the food is great, it's exceptional, but the expanded menu has too many misses for me.   TIP: Go for HH, 3-6PM daily, for half price apps and drink specials!"}
{"text":"It's all about the chicken. If you're planning to come here for the Hainan chicken and rice, like us and most people, the chicken itself is definitely more clean and less adulterated than the actually Hainan chicken. That also means less flavorful but more healthy. Their chicken is also free range so that's more healthy too.   The chicken comes with three different sauces - ginger scallion, soy sauce, and spicy sauce. All three of them are good but I think the best sauce for the chicken is at the paying counter. It's a sweet soy sauce that appears to be cooked and reduced and comes in a squeeze bottle. That sauce is so good that it can make anything taste amazing.   I thought the portion of chicken to rice was off. I guess this depends if your eat more rice or chicken. The ratio here was about one to one. I personally like more chicken and less rice. But it didn't matter because the rice was so good on its own. There is definitely chicken drippings or salted butter in it.   I also ordered the chrysanthemum tea - cold and half sweet. Their teas are made from loose leaf and it's free refills! I like the customization and free refill of course!   My only complaint was that the bathroom is located next door. My friend was directed to ring the doorbell next door and it actually caused more inconvenience as she had an awkward interaction with them. They also didn't initially assist her as she was looking around for the bathroom. It would be helpful to have a bathroom at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food although the menu is limited to Chicken.  Food is presented beautifully and their bar selection is quite wide. This is a Singapore influenced menu.  The poached chicken comes with 3 different sauces. I highly recommend the frites with truffle mayo. Energetic vibe. Will come here again soon."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I was skeptical and hesitant to try this place at first when I found out that they are known for their hainan chicken, since I'm not a huge fan of that dish typically. But it was actually REALLY good. I also really liked their fried chicken bao, it was one of the best pieces of fried chicken that I have ever had. I would definitely come check this place out if you are looking for some bomb asian food.   COME EAT THE CHICKEN!"}
{"text":"Food is to suffice.  The Bloody Mary's were very, very, very tasty. The Grand Opening was a spectacle.  Mayor Goodman, as they say was a pleasure, was in attendance.  The newest in fusion this little bistro in downtown will satisfy even the most stubborn of palettes."}
{"text":"This place always delivers and is consistent with their service and food! My bf and I come here at least once a month if not two or three or four. Simple yet delicious and satisfying food! Jenny is always wonderful as well.  We've had the hainan chicken rice with poached and roasted chicken. I prefer the former. Opt for adding things like broth, fried egg, 49° egg, poached egg or taiwanese sausage. I'll try the fried crispy skin next time for sure, I keep forgetting. The glazed wings are delicious as well and they offer different sauces from time to time.  They do run out of the poached chicken toward closing so call ahead to save one for yourself!  They have an agreement with next door if you need the restroom since their restaurant doesn't have one, just be sure to ask jenny"}
{"text":"After hearing so much ado made about the place I finally had a chance to stop in.  And it's OK.  The rice is good, the chicken well cooked, but it all falls a little flat.  The critic raved about ginger-scallion is passable to anyone who actually grew up with the stuff, as is the Chinese sausage, and there are better examples of both around town if you're willing to look.  It is nice to see chicken rice available in town but not so much so to justify going to that location.  The one standout thing is the de-boning of the chicken, it is a nice change of pace from the traditional presentation, especially if you're feeling lazy.  Oh, by the way, they don't have chopsticks, which makes for a very odd experience considering this is chopstick food.  Service is friendly but hectic, not surprising considering the small staff.  Overall, not bad and I don't regret going but I'm not going to make an effort to go again."}
{"text":"I read the Alison j post he is 100% right.I came there to day because my daughter heard about it.And ask me to hit it. The Hainan chicken is not the right thing.Roast chicken is not cook.I have to put it micro wave to heat it.I know the chinese way the chicken is raw the duck is well cook.But this is roast chicken.The taste sam's club is sure better.Pai choi for 2 dollars so so little portion. Bussinese is good.thing must the marketing is good"}
{"text":"My brother recommended this place to be when he was in Vegas a couple of months ago. We decided on the indo fried rice (special), hainese chicken, thai chicken wings, and the fried chicken rice plate. I really enjoyed the hainese chicken, as the chicken tasted really clean as other reviewers have noted. However, I do have to admit that I believe authentic hainese chicken should actually have that distinct chicken flavor, which this dish lacked (it only had the texture of chicken). Everything was okay as well, but the thai chicken wings were definitely over fried and was crunchy to the point where it was almost hard and difficult to swallow. Overall, I think that I would come back if given the chance!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try all 4 star restaurants or better in Vegas. Today, after reviewing this restaurant on Yelp, we decided to give it a try.   This restaurant is located in an old strip mall on Sahara. But inside the restaurant, the décor is pleasant and clean. The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Good first impression.   Their menu is simple and all items revolve around chicken. Hainam Chicken is a famous dish in South Eastern Asia. Unfortunately, few restaurants in North America has managed to do a good job - most restaurants try to cut corners and louse up the dish. The best Hainam Chicken Rice is offered in Singapore.   We ordered item #1 - the traditional Chicken dish, i.e. Hainam Chicken rice and item #3 - Roast Chicken.   Both chicken in the two ordered dishes were all fascinatingly well done. They are tender, moist, flavorful and juicy. Definitely a A+. No question about that.   Each entre comes with Chicken Rice ( rice cooked in Chicken broth ) and with condiments offered. Portion is not large but quite sufficient for a regular eater.   The Chicken Rice has room for improvement. On the outer side of the scoop of rice, they are a bit hard and tough and crusty -- left in the open a wee bit too long?? Flavor can be improved as well. The condiments and the cucumbers are very well done.  Add on items to the dishes are available, e.g. an organic fried egg, Chinese sausage and etc.  We did not order any of them, but we saw some customers did that and indeed they looked delicious.  Were it not for the rice, this is a five star restaurant. But the rice takes it down to 4 star or 4 1/2 star. Still a very fine place to eat.  4/23/17 note: I have since refused to visit this place due to the following incidents:  1. On 1/6/17 , I took a visiting party of friends ( total 7 ) to this place. Without any indication, I was charged an additional 15% for having a larger party. If the management can add charges indiscriminately, I can take my business elsewhere.  2. On 12/24/16, day before Christmas, we went to this place and instead of plates, we ate from paper plates -- the management said they want to give the employees a break. At the expense of the customers??"}
{"text":"We had dinner one day after their grand opening, so we were a bit apprehensive, what the heck, the menu is Asian Malaysian Singaporean mix with menu fixtures that had awesome reviews at previous restaurants.  I had the Laksa a mouthwatering explosion of Asian flavors such as curry, coconut, lemongrass garlic broth over rice noodles - fresh head on prawns, puffy crispy tofu and organic chicken - so fresh and delicious. They had another dish that was intriguing black cod over Thai corn chowder and truffle oil. Hubby had the farmers salad - fresh greens dressing, organ chicken - he luved.  Menu's signature Hainanese chicken rice dish was top of menu - brothy ginger, soy ginger scallion Chile sauce over rice with pickled mustard greens, will have to try next time! Our waiter was well versed in the menu and cocktail menu - which any drink is perfectly balanced and tasty. Decor is dimly lit, romantic high ceilings and you can actually carry on a conversation. Appetizers have Asian influences from wings to edamame. Street parking, hey it's downtown.  Great service and minimalist but tight menu, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Hello I just wanna let everybody know Flock and Fowl is wonderful. I eat there twice a week when I come into  town.  I highly recommend it.  i'm so glad there here in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Tasty but terrible service. 40 minutes to get a bao and some bok choy is unreasonable. Asked them for it several times, they kept saying it's coming soon but it never did. Basically had to stand at the counter and watch them - then it came out quickly. Ha!  Anyhow - tasty food but not enough to make up for the bad service. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooooooooo effin good!!!! Plus the customer service at this place is amazing! Luv it"}
{"text":"First off - to other reviewers/diners - please do us all a favor and don't come here if you're planning to order anything else on the menu other than Hainanese Chicken (aka Chicken Rice - for those in the know). You're just slowing up the line and making us wait even longer for the dish.   Hainanese Chicken definitely gets 5 stars - 6 stars even. They get a point off because service is excruciatingly S....L....O....W..... And the newbies (and those who don't know better) who have to be given a brief lesson on what the f*** chicken rice is, by the cashier - are not helping.   Again - the only order should be Hainanese Chicken Rice. And no, you don't order it with chinese sausage, nor do you eat it with an egg. You shouldn't even order it with the fried chicken skin (although, admittedly, I do because I love fried chicken).   For those lucky enough to have eaten this in Singapore (where it is considered the national dish) - you will find it laughable (or maybe not) that it takes this Vegas outpost 20-30 minutes to serve you the dish, where the standard hawker vendor/stall will whip it out in two minutes or less.   Please, please, please... step up the service (and the wait time)."}
{"text":"I've always went out of my way to visit this place when I'm in Vegas. This is my first time at the new location and am a bit disappointed that the restaurant dived into the popular hipster ambiance. I enjoyed it a lot more in the old location where it is more cozy with an authentic feel. There's definitely a lot more options to their menu now, but I wasn't too impressed. The food tasted okay."}
{"text":"Love this place. I usually try to make a stop here when I'm in Vegas. The hainanese chicken is soft and tender. The plate comes with 3 different sauces and pickled veggie. The fried chicken bun is amazing; chicken is still juicy. The kaya toast has a sweet and salty taste combo, which compliments each other. Think it's more of a savory dessert since it's topped with a sunny side egg and drizzled with sweet soy sauce. Vietnamese coffee is nice and strong."}
{"text":"Great find in Las Vegas!! I'm used to eating fast food, buffets, or pho whenever I'm in Vegas. A friend recommended flock & fowl because they saw them on food network. They only have about 5-6 things on the menu.   Food: #1 on the menu is hainan chicken with rice. The rice is delicious. The chicken is so tender and juicy, not dry at all. They also have 3 sauces that are made fresh by the chef. All 3 are just amazing. Beware because you WILL get stinky breath.   As for drinks, they have green tea, black tea, and French/Vietnamese coffee.   Ambience: Small place with just about 20 seats. Plus it's ran by a friendly couple, so be prepare to wait for the food to come out. But it's definitely worth the wait.   Service: great! The owner will tell you exactly how long the wait will be so that you're not mislead.   I really enjoyed my experience here at flock & fowl. I look forward to coming back and also trying their other restaurant, Fat Choy."}
{"text":"Five stars for the atmosphere, service, and novelty of the Hainan Chicken in Vegas. The chicken tasted very fresh. It doesn't have that industrial farm raised taste of mass produced chicken you get everywhere else. These guys know how to use ginger. I believe they serve it 2 ways maybe 3, with the hainan and through the sauce and pickles. It's not overpowering, but enough to make a presence. The atmosphere was very clean and home-y. The servers were very informative and soft natured to complement the atmosphere. For what it's known for, the price is reasonable. My food came out quicker than I expected.                                                     I think my biggest reservation is their use of plastic utensils. Even though the chicken was soft, It wasn't easy to cut through with plastic spoons or forks. Either they should provide plastic knives or switch to regular metal utensils. A piece of my chicken fell off the plate and onto the floor trying to cut a piece. Overall a great first time experience and would definitely comeback, maybe not every week but definitely once a month, when I get a fresh hainan craving."}
{"text":"Jenny is one of the sweetest people in Vegas! Came in during their soft opening, and they have completely transformed the space. I really dig the textured wall paper, and the modern minimal decor with farmhouse accents.  Unfortunately, when I visited they were out of rice- I'll have to return to try their Hainan chicken dish, but I was thoroughly impressed with the items I did try, and Jenny's top-notch, friendly service.  CHOPPED SALAD: Lettuce, kale, avocado, almonds, fried shallots, seasonal veg, and sesame vin. The dressing was light but flavorful, and the seasonal vegetables on this visit included red grapes and sweet plum tomatoes. It was a shockingly fresh and flavorful salad, and adding the fried chicken filet on top makes it a filling meal. TWICE COOKED SICHUAN CHICKEN WINGS: Available by the half or full pound, these are damn delicious. Slightly sticky, sweetly sauced, with great flavor. Definitely a win for Sheridan Su! I'd say these are a must-get item.  I'll be back for their five-spice chicken bao and the Hainan chicken! Heads up that they close at 3:30PM, so this is exclusively a lunch spot. They also have very limited seating (4 2-tops and one 4-top), since the space is very small. Props for having ample (and comfortable) seating for takeout orders or waiting customers!"}
{"text":"I think the food here is really good but just not worth the price.   I have been here a few times now and enjoyed the food both times. Services was good, friendly staff, water re-filled, dirty plates are picked up. This place is rather small, lucky we came in a little early today otherwise we would not have gotten a table.   Tried the fried chicken bad and thought that was ok, nothing special. Just the bun, fried chicken, greens on top and sweet sauce. The fried rice was ok, tasted like curry rice, I really liked the soft boiled egg on top though.   The Hainan Chicken rice...tastes good but small portion for the price. $10 is not bad but because Big Wong has the same rice for cheaper and tastes just as delicious, I prefer Big Wong. The portion here looks like its doll's food, the plate is huge but the little rice, few pieces of chicken, tiny little sauces, 4 pieces of tiny cucumber and the little veggies made it looked really comical. Rice is really tasty, chicken is soft smells amazing, the three sauces are nice. I like the food here, but nothing screamed special or would make me come back here specifically.   For a small local place the add-ons are a bit ridiculous! Extra $1 for broth, $2 for everything else...their portion is quite small, if you want the add-ons it can add up quite a bit.   I much prefer the Hainan Chicken rice at Big Wong, much cheaper, bigger portion, the sauces are better too. Presentation is not as nice since Big Wong is a simple place for food, but their chicken rice is better."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the excellent and unique cuisine at this new local restaurant.  Especially loved the homemade egg drop soup!! We ordered the burger and it was absolutely delicious! Really GREAT combination of flavors! The wine was a good solid Cab!"}
{"text":"Better location than the old place- but the Sahara location taste better.  I guess the upgrade is to get more customers. Has a little bit more in the menu as well.  For the traditional Hainanese chicken - it ok- sauce were dry.  The one hour egg helped with the dry rice.  We also had the chicken pasta salad - I was ok.  You can buy that dressing at a supermarket and add some vegetable on a spaghetti noodle.  Nothing spectacular.  The wings are ok as well- get the salt and pepper or spicy - not the honey.  The dessert helped out cookie a lode- made fresh.  Only save our dinner is the service- it was great.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly.  Maybe my expectations were too high since they were nominated for a James Beard.  If you want Hainanese chicken with rice- try the place in Durango- small menu, quality control."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a 4-day vacay & found this restaurant online via USA online website that give it great reviews. This is a great mom/pop place. The staff was helpful in assisting with our meal and the service is excellent; food great and would recommend. The food is affordable and not expensive."}
{"text":"I got Hainan chicken which was only okay. Chicken tasted dry and we had to pay more to get stock on the side. The portion is pathetically small; I had ordered a side of vegetables of the day and it was so little when it came.   Also the bathroom situation was very odd, they do not have public restroom in the restaurant. You'll have to rely on the kindness of the next-door costume store owner and use their bathroom. The lady  who took our order when asked about the bathroom situation, was very defensive about it to.  Overall, this place is over-rated in my opinion. any home-made Hainan chicken taste way better than this.  updates: as shown below, the owner is very defensive. I've never heard of a restaurant settling on mediocre quality just to stay consistent. I am not opening a restaurant but I for sure don't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first but their Hainan chicken is as good as everyone claims! Order the: -poached chicken (Hainan chicken) it's served with rice cooked in the chicken broth and 3 dipping sauces. The chicken is tender and cooked to perfection  -buttermilk fried chicken  -siracha wings  -fried chicken bao -roasted spring chicken   It's small inside but the waitresses were nice and the food came out quickly. You order at the counter and find a table afterwards. What a hidden gem!   Price point: $"}
{"text":"Fun hip ambiance but I think it's overpriced. They only accept cards and NO CASH! We had a large party but they were kind enough to push together tables  and make it work. As for our waiter, he kept asking how everything was, looking at all the empty plates on the table, and walking alway. Then again, there were a lot of us and it got busy in there. Also, the lights they have above the tables look cool but they aren't good for actually illuminating the area. The food itself tasted great. I recommend trying their spin off of deviled eggs. Yum!"}
{"text":"Finally checking out one of sheridan and jenny's restuarants. I ordered the hainan chicken rice, the chicken sando, and the fries. They were all delicious. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow. More people need to know about this place, absolutely incredible food. You can tell they really take pride in what they do, I highly recommend going here!!!"}
{"text":"Quaint chicken spot with minimalist feel.  Had roasted chicken meal and it was juicy with a nice crispy skin.  Recommend opting for the egg on the rice."}
{"text":"Roasted chicken is fantastic.   Crisp skin and perfectly cooked.  Great selection of teas as well"}
{"text":"Holy chicken! This is the place to be.  So the owner of this place is also the owner of the  amazing Fat Choy restaurant, found in the Eureka Casino. If you've tried Fat Choy and thoroughly enjoyed it, Flock & Fowl is just as good, if not better!  So the workers here are so incredibly friendly (thank you, Liz)! They are very knowledgeable of the chicken, where it comes from, etc. Yes, it is free range chicken. The eggs are organic. The hainan chicken rice is cooked in chicken fat and chicken broth, giving it more flavor.  I always order the #1 which is a poached chicken that comes with three different sauces. I order an extra fried egg as well. The sauces are so damn good. I always have trouble remembering the names of them all. My boyfriend orders a #3 which is a roasted chicken and he gets extra fried chicken skin on the side.  The food here is incredible. I just feel like my Yelp review cannot do justice to what my tastebuds thoroughly enjoy.   Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Even though we were such an annoying customers today, the servers were so sweet and nice! We had great service and their food was DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"I have very high standards coming from SGV, so I was very excited when I heard about Flock and Fowl. I was super disappointed by the Hainan chicken--bland chicken, not exciting chili sauce, and not flavorful rice. The saving grace is the ginger scallion and sweet soy sauces. They use good quality chicken here and debone it for you, but I wouldn't go out if my way to get Hainan chicken from here. Their bao is pretty good, but I've also had much better versions of it. The food here is pretty standard, good but not extraordinary. Next time I'd want to try the fried chicken, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Top quality food and great service!  This a small restaurant slightly off the strip. The dishes all centered around chicken...hence the name. Everything is organic.   We got the Hainan chicken, wing trio, roasted chicken salad, and buttermilk fried chicken Bao.   My favorite is definitely the buttermilk fried chicken bao but the Hainan chicken was one of the best I've tasted! The chicken was super tender, juicy and flavorful. Make sure to get a side of chicken broth for 99cents cuz it was also very delicious! No MSG.   The wings were pretty good but a little on the sweeter side then I would like. Maybe the ability to choose the level of spiciness will be great too since I could use more heat on the chicken wings.   The roasted chicken with organic salad was good too but it was overshadowed by the other dishes.  I was also very impressed by the wonderful service! They made sure we had enough water, tea refills and whatever we needed. Service was attentive without being overbearing. You order at the counter first. Food came fast!  We ate a lot of places this Vegas trip and this place was by far our favorite!   Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl is such an amazing restaurant. The Hainanese Chicken Rice is honestly the best rice on this planet. The Buttermilk Fried Chicken is delicious. The pickles and dipping sauces that come with are awesome. The side of Chinese Sausage is very different but very yummy. All of the seasonings on the food are on point. The atmosphere is light and airy. The service is always wonderful. As a local, it is definitely one of my favorite places to eat! I recommend it to everybody and anybody. I LOVE FLOCK & FOWL!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Flock & Fowl so much!! Troy was our server and he made the dining experience absolutely fantastic. The flavors are unique and we enjoyed every dish. The curry broth and deviled eggs were my Favorite! Thanks for the suggestions, Troy!"}
{"text":"One of our friends told us about the restaurant. It is very nice and cozy. The food is very delicious.  Will definitely go there again when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"When every other restaurant had a wait for 1 hour, Flock and Fowl accommodated us immediately. Very courteous service! Chicken Wings were very good. Gave us free sliders for checking into yelp. Got the fried chicken sando- good portion. Friend got the steak- Tiny but tender and good. Curry Noodle Soup was a winner for me being that i found most of the food a bit salty for my taste. Otherwise would recommend!"}
{"text":"Growing up eating my mother's version of Hainanese Chicken Rice (she's from Hainan) - I have always held high expectations for the dish. Flock & Fowl definitely met those expectations. The boyfriend came in on opening day and were greeting immediately by nothing but friendly faces. The environment is very relaxing and the food was great. I loved the softness of chicken and the rice was nothing short of perfect. Jenny and her team and amazing and we would definitely come back next time we're in town !"}
{"text":"the first time i dined at flock & fowl was at the sahara location.  my experience was so poor that i didn't return until the new location opened.  at the sahara location, my hubby and i walked in and we were the only ones there.  being our first time, we ordered everything on the menu which at the time was only 5 items.  shortly after we placed our order, a few more people came in the restaurant and ordered.  in about 10 mins, the small restaurant was full.  when the food started coming out of the kitchen, we noticed others receiving the food that we ordered.  after all of the other tables received food except for us, i brought it to the server's attention.  she said our food was coming out soon but i pointed out to her that all of our food did already come out and that she gave it to other tables.  she seemed appalled by what she had done so she went into the kitchen and we could hear her telling chef sheridan about it and then we heard them yelling at each other about it.  our food did eventually come out.  it was mildly tasty but nothing too exciting.  we also didn't receive any recompense for waiting almost 45 mins for our food except an honest apology.  recently, i went to the new flock & fowl with a friend.  she isn't big on hainan chicken so she decided to order the chicken sandwich.  however, on the website it states that the chicken is thigh meat but at the restaurant it doesn't specify.  so, we asked the server, and he also didn't know so had to go ask.  he was really nice but i have to say, when there are less than 10 items on the menu, i feel the servers should know the menu front and back without having to ask.  the food was less than average.  my hainan chicken was barely at room temp but the slaw was hot.  the mustard greens were definitely from a package.  the chicken in my dish and my friend's sandwich were both dry.  the fries were soggy.    0 for 2 so i won't be returning.  which i'm sure is neither here nor there to this restaurant who gets more than enough free advertising from all of the instagrammers and yelpers who think this place is the best.  all i know is that you can't keep a business running if your clients are a small group of people.  you have to be able to cater to everyone and always serve the best food with the best service."}
{"text":"Been here twice since here in Vegas. Got shut out twice bc I wasn't aware of their lunch only hours. The other time they closed early due to some emergency situation.  When I was finally able to dine in, I wasn't disappointed. Tried the roast chicken (bc they were sold out of the Hainanese chicken), honey sriacha wings, and fries chicken bao with their homemade lemonade. The second time, I was finally able to try the Hainanese chicken (aka poached chicken w the works), thai wings, and fried chicken bao, w the lemonade w splash of tea. Everything lived up to the hype. Food is clean and organic. Nothing is heavy or greasy. Also the service is above par along with food quality. The owner knew my name surprisingly by my second visit. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is surprisingly great (I was hesitant at the fusion) and drinks are bomb. Music is dope, ambiance is chill, location is cool."}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl. Owned by the same owners as Fat Choy inside the Eureka Casino.  First off, I'm not too fond of the location of this place. I went during lunch, so it wasn't too bad. However, I don't think I'd visit at night (Maybe that's why they close at 3:30pm?) Lol.  Jenny was the only one working the front, so the service was a bit slow. It was expected, since we kinda went during the lunch rush. But she did make sure we were well taken care of.  I ordered the #1 Hainan Chicken Rice. All I can say is: It was DELISH! It comes with 3 sauces (ginger scallion, housemade soy, and chili sauce), rice, broth, a few slices of cucumbers, and some preserved mustard greens. The chicken looked a little dry, but when bitten into, was nice, tender, and juicy. I guess it was borderline of being a bit overcooked? I guess looks can be deceiving. =P I got mine with a sunnyside up egg. Mix in the egg yolk and some ginger scallion sauce into the rice and that in itself could've been a meal!  I also had an order of the fried chicken bao. Imo, it was pretty much a chicken finger bao. Nothing too special. The chicken was a bit dry though. I'll stick to ordering bao from Fat Choy instead. Lol.  Overall, I would give this place 4.5 stars. I'll definitely be dropping by again if I'm in the area. :)"}
{"text":"***Insider Secret***    Get a fried egg on top of your rice!  Super nom!  To me, service is a big part.  Every time I go there, the owner knows my name and greets me.  I just smile and say \"Hi sweetie, great to see you\"; but the fact that she remembered me after the first time, says a lot. That being said, food is DELISH! My ADD appreciates the limited menu.  Its a goto for a healthy, but tasty lunch.   Two Small downsides- 1. Close early 2. Chicken breast is not skinless (I prefer no skin), but I peal it off like a big boy!"}
{"text":"After much anticipation, the second Flock and Fowl location has opened its doors! I stopped by with friends after volunteering at the Rescue Mission, and it was a perfect way to celebrate the upcoming holiday season!   With dinner service comes a variety of dishes not found at the Sahara location, along with a bar and creative cocktail choices.  I started dinner off with a Le Grand, with vodka, honey, lime, Le Grand Courtage, and Australian bitters - so good!!   We ordered some wings, edamame (loved the sweet chili on these!) and I went with the burger l for my entree. How good is a burger at a place known for chicken? Really, really good. The buns are made locally, just for F&F, and the texture is somewhere between brioche and bao. Soooo good!   Chef sent out  a couple of desserts, their Kaya Toast, and one I hadn't had before - a warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream and miso caramel.   Love this new location, and ability to get my F&F fix for dinner. Great service, food, and drinks - the company was outstanding too!"}
{"text":"Cool hipster foodie hub w/ Friendly staffs. I like how this is not your typical restaurant. They take inspiration from different countries and put it on their menu. You can have a Thai or Singaporean version of chicken if you like. If you're looking for traditional authentic versions, you may not find it here as they are more Americanized. I wouldn't say the food is within my flavor palette. The menu was cool but the sauce and seasoning weren't innovative enough for me.  The sauce in the Bao tasted like burnt soy sauce. The other dishes we had were on the bland side or something we had already. I like the fact that they're doing something different but it's not a place I look forward to eating at again."}
{"text":"So this place is amazing! Small cozy inviting bar. The Bartende staff Adam  and Gene are super knowledgeable know there stuff and can guide you to make your experience the one of a kind. I'm so glad I finally came down here now because I definitely feel once people figure out how delicious this place it will be hard to get a seat. What a great addition to DTLV."}
{"text":"WE LOVE FLOCK AND FOWL DT!  One of our favorite places to go!  The atmosphere and ambiance is amazing--very hip and modern-- the service is top notch and the food...OMG...the food is HANDS DOWN THE BEST.  We've eaten there a handful of times and always order different things to share.  We've have the Flock Frites, which are curly fries with shaved Parmesan and Flock sauce (like a spicy ranch of sorts), the Miso Black Garlic Hummus with scallion pancakes (hello, YUM), the traditional Hainanese Chicken Rice (You have to try it. The chicken has some of the best flavor of anything I have ever had) the Bang Bang Chicken Noodle Salad (my favorite thing!) and the Hot Flock Sando!!  Seriously, we haven't had a bad dish there!!  Jenny, the owner, is so incredibly hands on. Whenever she is on site, she makes sure to talk to each and every guest. She really goes out of her way to make every single person feel at home. Their management team is stellar, greets us at the door and welcomes us in.  Their servers are always on point..I never have to ask for refills and they make sure we enjoy every aspect of our dinner. We recommend Flock and Fowl DT to all of our friends!  So happy to have stumbled across this amazing place."}
{"text":"I have traveled to Singapore many times and one of my must have dishes when I visit is chicken rice. A staple of Singaporean culture of poached chicken, flavorful rice, and your staple of 3 sauces: ginger & scallion, soy sauce blend, and chili sauce.  Obviously nothing can beat the authentic dish but born and raised in LA, I understand how close the dish can come to the original. Now that I have been living in Vegas for the past few years and after trying out a variety of places that offer hainan chicken (most of them are located in Chinatown), I  now know who sets the bar and it is Flock & Fowl.  This is their second location which is much bigger to cater to the very high demand they have. The space is more than twice the original location in the Ogden near Fremont.  When you first walk in, you would notice that this is a cashless restaurant. Credit card payments accepted only. First of its kind that I've seen in Vegas which I am all for.  The servers are the same friendly faces from the first location. They are having all their staff working in their second location to ensure everything is running well while the first location on Sahara is closed for a short while.   I always recommend the #1 Poached Chicken with an 1 hour egg (aka onsen tamago), and you can't go wrong with the Chinese sausage or the broth. Their chicken is organic which is a must for this dish. The laksa is another Singaporean dish with a broth that consists of coconut milk/curry base and rice noodle. Something great if you want to try something different. Very hard to find this dish in Vegas.  You will have to pay for street parking at $2 an hour if you park right in front the restaurant. Definitely one of the must try hidden restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Man, we all know how amazing this place is...! I just never have time to drive down there to eat and enjoy my weekend since I work so much, ugh. Of course, I like the original Flock and Fowl (on Sahara) so much and I was super excited when I heard that they were expanding their business and open another one in downtown. Definitely better atmosphere then the original location, it's just too far from me to drive down there, that's all! Adore F&F so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Hainan chicken with the requisite dipping sauces.  Ginger based sauce was the favorite as usual and the mildly flavored rice complemented the chicken well.  Extras available at a reasonable cost, extra chicken, fried egg, house made chicken broth, Chinese sausage, etc.."}
{"text":"Location: The location is not the best area in town, hole in the wall. Small size, can only fit 6 small tables so don't bring the whole crew and eat here. There is no restroom, so make sure you go before hitting this place . It's close to SLS so it's convenient for tourists.   Decor: nothing special about the decor. They have many menus posted on the wall. It's pretty clean and they keep it up well. But it's probably not hard to do since it's a small space to start with.   Menu: love that they have organic/ grass fed chicken. You can definetely tell the difference between antibiotic chicken and grass fed ones. Their rice is seasoned well and I love the three spice/ sauces that comes with it. It's not as good as the original one in Singapore but it's acceptable. Price is a bit high. Expect to pay $15-20 for lunch. They have Vietnamese coffee which is STRONG!! I need it to get through the day.   Service is fantastic. It's pre-order and pre-paid. But I usually give tips anyway since they clean the plates afterwards so you don't have to worry.   Recommendation: a safe and better location will do it. Somewhere is Southwest would be good so we don't have to worry about safety.   Overall, I go here sometimes for lunch since it's relatively close from my work. It's also fast in and out so it's convenient for work lunch. I would not go during night time. Not sure if it's safe."}
{"text":"As a final countdown before our baby arrives, my husband and I had made reservations around town at restaurants we had on our \"gotta try\" list. Obviously needed to visit F&F after reading about Chef Su's James Beard nomination!   To get to the restaurant, you park downtown (near Fremont) which is great because after dinner you can work off dessert by walking around and people watching! There are multiple pay-to-park lots and we had no trouble finding parking.   We were seated at our reserved table right away for our 6pm reservation. The restaurant wasn't terribly busy at all at that time, but more people arrived as the night progressed. Our great waiter, Larry, acquainted us with the menu and gave us some suggestions after we had asked. We ordered wings with angry sauce and honey butter, the #1 with a fried egg and Chinese sausage, and the laksa. The wings were perfectly cooked and had exactly the right amount of sauce; not too dry at all! When ordering, Larry warned that our poached chicken would arrive room temperature, so we were not surprised when it was. I understand how some people may find the temperature off-putting, but it was delicious. We especially enjoyed the rice + egg and although I had never had Chinese sausage before it was my favorite component of the dish! The laksa had full flavor and I loved the thickness of the broth/base- each part of that dish was cooked well, too. I had never tried laksa before, but I'm a fan now! Finally, to end our evening, we enjoyed the cookie. What can I say about a fresh, warm cookie that would surprise you? It was delicious and comforting; we loved it.   On an unrelated note, it's 2018 and I'm not 80 years old. I find it laughable that people complained in their reviews that they had to pay via iPad; I'd rather pay immediately and not have to wait for the server to perform the rigmarole of dropping off the bill, collecting it, and returning my card/change. It was extremely low pressure and our entire meal was only $55, what a deal!"}
{"text":"the savoy in Vegas. you can't get better than this. gotta try list and gotta try every time i wen there. no other word can described how deep my love for this place."}
{"text":"The hainan chicken rice and iced lemon tea are super! My friends and I enjoyed it so much. The owners are so nice that we went there out of the business hours, but they said they could make the to-go for us."}
{"text":"Exceptional food! Jenny, the owner, is an incredible woman and guided us through the food we were eating, showing exceptional care and passion for the food we were eating. It's a terrific place to go if you want to get off the strip and out of the big hotel restaurants to taste food that's truly exceptional!"}
{"text":"I'm not surprised Flock & Fowl is garnering national recognition. The food here shows delightful restraint and a true respect for the products being featured.  Urban chic design and hip-hop soundtrack lends itself well to an informal experience but simultaneously the high level of organization, exceptional attention to steps of service and cleanliness speak to a high level of training and awareness.  Highlights were of course the chicken & rice, we tried the poached version (impeccable) with sides of Chinese sausage and roasted vegetables.  The market salad featured 4 types of pickled and fresh fruits and vegetables over mixture of different greens, definitely a great item for a lite lunch.  Quinoa & broccoli with tofu and sesame dressing was lite and fluffy, barely seasoned it really speaks to the texture of the ingredients.  But the show stopper is the Laksa, lite coconut and curry noodles with tofu and micro herbs comes together in a synergy not frequently found. There is a shuttle ethereal sweetness that permeates and the texture of the broth coats the noodles just right. I'll be coming back again for this soon.  Really great spot!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. My coworkers and I loved our lunches - hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome...awesome...awesome!!!!! The Hainan chicken with rice was something to write home about. The chicken was moist, perfectly poached, high-quality chicken that could stand alone without a single dip. The three dipping sauces, including sweet soy (my favorite), tasty ginger scallion, and a rockin' sambal greatly complimented the chicken. The broth...the often overlooked broth--was chock-full of flavor and the rice absorbed it all. Even the thinly sliced cucumber garnish was a treat. For $8.99 this lunch really scores.   The chicken wings are meaty and the two-step fried and braised preparation resulted in a nicely glaze coating with the slightest kick. I am normally not a wing fan, but I'm a fan of these.  Jenny (the co-owner) is a service superstar...friendly, accurate, knowledgeable, and patient while Chef Su is, of course, outstanding.  This place is simple made superb!!  I'll be back whenever I'm in the neighborhood at lunch time."}
{"text":"First time here and I am really impressed with the food. The salad is great, has grapes, mangoes, avocado, corn, etc... Really good. The chicken has great flavor and the Indonesian rice is good but a little salty... I will be back... Only drawback.. Open only  5 hours daily until 3:30 pm... Closed Sunday and Monday"}
{"text":"I don't usually drive to Downtown Las Vegas so when I was in the area I had no idea where to eat. We found this restaurant accidentally driving around. The name was just so catchy that we had to come by.  The restaurant is very hip. I liked the atmosphere right when I stepped in. The staff was friendly and greeted us right away. The restaurant isn't big at all maximum capacity is 79 people. It has a intimate dining setting which I enjoyed.  Our waiter was Troy and he was super duper nice! He provided excellent service and took the time to explain the dishes. He gave great recommendations on what to add to our dishes which made it amazing.   The food was awesome! I had the Bacon Cheese burger and added egg as well as Foie Gras. The burger was cooked perfectly at medium rare! The patty was so juicy and soft omg it melted in my mouth. Egg and Foie Gras was recommended by our waiter Troy and that's the only way I think you should order this burger. Pop that egg and smear that Foie Gras and it was to die for! We also tried appetizers such as their crispy chicken wings, flock frites which is their version of curly fries, and the son in law which is deviled eggs in a Tamarind sauce. All tasted great.   Only thing I was disappointed at was that their sodas was in cans. No bottomless drinks there which is a bummer since you pay such a high price for a can soda.   We were too full to try any desert but maybe next time we will save some space for it.  Overall I would recommend this place especially if you want to bring a date. The food is reasonable priced for the atmosphere and deliciousness it provides. Staff was very friendly and very attentive. Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant during our vacation to Las Vegas and I am so glad we did! It was one of the best and most affordable meals we had during our trip. We started with flock frites, which were perfectly crunchy and full of truffle goodness. Then we split the chicken rice. The chicken had wonderful flavor and was very tender. All the accompaniments were perfect! We picked the one hour egg and Chinese sausage as our sides. I wish I didn't have to travel so far for this yummy meal again!"}
{"text":"\"Your work is to discover your world and then with all your heart give yourself to it.\" - Buddha  I first came to Flock & Fowl right after they opened for their now famous Hainan Chicken Rice. This dish is famous for a reason...it's good. But I continue to introduce others to Flock & Fowl because so much of their menu is simply as good as it gets!  My favorite item at F&F is the Night Market Fried Chicken Bao. This appetizer chicken sandwich is the best chicken sandwich I have had. It is composed of five spice buttermilk fried chicken, kale pea sprout sesame slaw, and a steamed bun. I recommend adding a fried quail egg...but then again, I never turn down the opportunity for a euphoric burst of egg yolk--flocking delicious! You need a few to fill up if you aren't enjoying other items. I don't do a lot of fried food, so I normally order one and fill up in other ways.  Honey Siracha & Thai Carmel Chicken Wings with Crispy Garlic! If I'm here with someone for the first time then we must share some chicken wings! I suggest splitting an 8 piece order with both flavors if you are having them for the fist time. Again, these are the best in town. Most of us enjoy sweet and tangy flavors at the same time...restaurants and lines of food exist on this concept...F&F's wings are an excellent example of sweet and tangy flavors coming together. As you bite in, your lips are inundated with their gooey exterior as your teeth crunch through the exterior to moist chicken below--perfectly amazing!  When my love and I come in to F&F we normally would eat a Night Market Fried Chicken Bao each and then share the Flock & Fowl Salad. For $10.99 the salad comes with your choice of Roasted Spring Chicken, Buttermilk Fried Chicken Tenders, or Poached Chicken...or you can just do the salad consisting of lettuces, kale, avocado, almonds, seasonal vegetable & fruits, with a sesame vin dressing for $7.99. This is one of the more robust and flavorful salads I know of. The seasonal fruits and vegetables are amazing, often propelling this salad into as good as gets Territory for me. Since I usually have a fried chicken bao with the salad I do the salad only option, but the Roasted Spring Chicken is delicious if you want chicken with it.   Oh yeah, and what about the famous Hainan Chicken Rice...if you grew up with this style of chicken then you need to check out F&F. So many of my friends that like this dish say that F&F is the best or one of the best versions of this dish that they have enjoyed.  Regardless of whether you're enjoying Hainan Chicken Rice, Night Market Fried Chicken Bao, Chicken Wings, or Flock & Fowl Salad, the good people at Flock & Fowl decided to put the Buddha's thoughts to practice in the form of chicken. Let us all decide to discover our world and then give ourselves to it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Hainan chicken rice. The 2nd location is just as quaint as the first location. The buttermilk chicken bao is yum AF. Service was great"}
{"text":"DEEEEEE-LISH!!!  Ordered delivery for office lunch.  bit of this, tad of that and a side of...  I was shocked at just how fresh and delicious everything was.  We split the Flock and Fowl Salad which was full of surprising yummy goodness. Fruits and nuts and greens and grains and PERFECTLY dressed!  Sides of rice, fried skins and Chinese sausage. Everything was absolutely tops.  I look forward to making it in for an actual entree. This will be added to the top of our regular office lunch menu."}
{"text":"If you love Hainan Chicken rice you definitely have to come here!!!! The condiments that come with are first class as well. This is one of the best versions I have had since living in Singapore."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Flock & Fowl for quite some time so when the chance came up I was very much looking forward to a delicious meal.  I ordered the poach chicken with a side of broth and Chinese sausage.  I then had a hard time figuring how to feel after having several bites.  Everything I tasted lacked flavor except for the broth.  The texture of the poached chicken was more \"rough\" than I would have liked and the Chinese sausage was just OK.  The flavored rice tasted very plain to me even with a splash of the Cantonese soy sauce.  Speaking of sauces, only the spicy sauce was enjoyable as the ginger sauce just didn't pack enough flavor for my liking.  All of this summed up to a mediocre meal that was quite pricey, $15 for my order, located off strip.  The staff were very nice and attentive and based on the other reviews, they may have just had an off day in the kitchen."}
{"text":"PREFACE  Even though the wildly popular Savoy is just a 5 minute drive from me, I have only been there twice in all the years I've known of its success. (For you Las Vegans, I'm referring to a place in Alhambra, CA.) Since I was not impressed with their Hainan Chicken the first time, I thought I try it again given the 2k+ reviews. Second time around, I was still not impress by the dry so called Hainan Chicken.   ONTO THE REVIEW  I came in with low expectations; I've had my Hainan Chicken heart broken before.   Like other have said, the restaurant is located in your not so typical plaza. But can't complain since there are plenty of free parking. The restaurant is small but cute, very modern and definitely a minimalist feel to it.  When you first walk in be sure to place your order. If you're dining in, the cashier (who also serves as waitress) will let you know which table you can take. If you're ordering to go, there are seats along the wall.  This is not a fast food joint, so expect a bit of a wait before your meal is brought out.   We ordered:    -Hainanese Chicken Rice w/Chinese Sausage and Chicken Broth:  The best Hainan Chicken I have ever tasted! The chicken is moist and flavorful! Pair it with the ginger and soy, perfection! The Chinese Sausage was just ok, wouldn't get again. Didn't enhance the dish further. And I can definitely pass on the broth (a bit too bland for my liking).  -Hainan Fried Chicken Rice w/Chinese Sausage and Chicken Broth: Decided to get this dish so that we can sample other things on their menu. Like another Yelper had said: skip this. I have to agree. Nothing really exciting about. I enjoyed the dipping sauce that was specifically for this fried chicken, but you're better off getting their Hainanese Chicken Rice.   Next time we are in Vegas, we will certainly be back for their Hainan Chicken!"}
{"text":"My dish was good, my friends not so much. The service was friendly, informative but I would not come her for a quick bite. Tea was good but took a long time to get. It was 30 mins before our food order was taken and we had to call the server over to take it.  I had the Coconut curry noodles, with shrimp, tofu, chicken, and sprouts. A bit spicy & shrimp was whole, head & all.   Chicken salad had poached chicken with the fatty skin still on and little to no flavor in it."}
{"text":"Highly recommend  the Hainan chicken with fried egg and Chinese sausage.  The kaya toast with foie gra was delicious too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here after reading about the success of this restaurant. We tried the Hainan chicken rice, chicken bao, and the chicken salad. It was all very tasty and clean but I have to say the salad was my favorite. There are so many components to the salad from edamame to pickled mango and I love the dressing!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic unimposing little cafe/eatery right off the LV strip.  I knew it was going to be delicious when the place filled up immediately after opening in the morning.    Delicious food, good service, great prices & friendly staff.  A real gem!"}
{"text":"I finally got to come in to eat dinner here. We have been waiting since they've announced their opening in July or August.   First my husband came in last week and he had the chicken and rice, he said it was good not great and the portions small, the broth was cold. We go to Singapore every year and we've eaten plenty of laksa, chicken and rice from all the Hawker Stalls to the fancy restaurants in SNG, I think we can compare. So the day my husband went in, maybe that was just a one off. So we come back again and I ordered Laksa and he ordered egg drop soup bowl, easy stuff. We weren't too hungry lol.  When our food came out, the egg drop soup was cold and kind of bland but love the mushrooms there was plenty. My laksa came out pipping hot, very little broth which is odd and small portion. They did say I can ask for more noodles and broth but wasn't sure if that's extra plus I wasn't that hungry. Anyway, the laksa was salty, I really couldn't taste anything but salt not fish sauce salty but salt salty. It looked delicious though but I didn't eat it after three bites, I just couldn't.   I've also noticed that they let the food sit on the counter for a while before they serve it. Counter meaning where the cooks put the plated food for the servers to take. Lol Granted there was only one server and a busser working but the kitchen looked confused as well. It was weird to watch them asking who's food goes to what table while one person is looking through all the receipts and then giving it to the chef to look as well. But maybe just maybe it's because they're still working out the kinks, I mean they just opened and I want them to keep the doors open. Service was good and very friendly. But I'll wait to come back and hope they improve on quality."}
{"text":"It is clearly an Asian Fusion place with very friendly and cool staff right in the down town Las Vegas area.  And I like the fact they only accept credit card. Cashless makes it easy and neat.   I have had better hainan chicken with rice in Singapore and Thailand, however, it is fair to say their food is ok for American standard.   The price is around 14.99 per combo with the chicken rice and 2 other sides.  The Vietnamese coffee is a bit of a miss cuz the way they make it. I guess it is because it was pre brewed and not enough condense milk. The waitress took the coffee charge of the bill once she learnt I was not exactly a big fan. And asked me for any suggestions of improvement.  All in all, will I come back again, most likely! I do miss the tender poached chicken with the delicious chicken soup."}
{"text":"Hainanese chicken is spreading like a disease in the Bay Area, and I was never really a huge fan of it.  Holy crap this restaurant impressed me. The service was 10/10. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Our server described every dish and answered any questions we had. I didn't order the hainanese chicken, but the rest of my party all ordered it and loved it. You get to pick 2 sides with it as well. I ordered the Laksa, which was a coconut curry with noodles and prawn and chicken. Creamy, savory, fresh, and a great change-up in my diet as I had been eating fried food all weekend during our road trip. Presentation of the food was nice. Ambiance was also clean and chic. Great little gem in DTLV!"}
{"text":"The Hainan chicken hit very close to home. The free range chicken and home made sauces reminded me a lot of my mother's cooking. The chicken was very tender and moist. The ginger and scallion sauce was my favorite, although it could've been a tad bit more gingery in my opinion. We ordered the fried chicken tender and poached Hainan chicken plates with Chinese sausage and broth as sides. The sausage was a bit overcooked and the broth was a bit bland. The rice, however, was very good. It seemed like a mix between white and brown rice. I think it is cooked in chicken broth but you may want to double check with Jenny or Liz on that. Jenny and Liz were super sweet and checked up on us often. Napkins, moist towelettes, and our water cups were always replaced when dirty or empty. We also ordered eight chicken wings, 4 honey sriracha and 4 Thai wings. Both were very tasty and flavorful. They do come out boiling hot so watch your fingertips when you decide to dig right in.  The only downside is that this restaurant does not have a restroom. If you really really need to go, you can go to the restroom at the cigar store a couple stores down (as Jenny recommended). Only downside is that you will come back reeking of smoke. Oh and you'll also be eyed down by the hoard of guys smoking in there if you're only one girl. I did this and I spent the whole time sniffing myself rather than enjoying my meal. Next time, I'll try the restroom at Capriottis.   The portions are smaller than what I'm used to when it comes to Asian food and a bit overpriced. A Hainan chicken plate is $9-$10. The broth is an additional 99cents and a side of Chinese sausage is $1.99. A side of 8 wings is around $9-$10 so it does add up!"}
{"text":"I just returned from vacation in las vegas and have to rave about this little gem hiding in a hole in the wall.  My son found it on yelp because it was right next door to where we were staying.  This place us incredible!!!   The food is sooo fresh and sooo delicious it's hard to describe.   I'm american, my wife is chinese, and this food is both.  Flock and fowl has done a great job of fusing the two together.  I feel like this is the first really unique food I've had in some time. And Jenny even remembers everyone of her regulars by name  It sounds like the poached chicken is really great but they sell out quick,  so go early!   We had all the rest and it was all good! The roasted chicken was my favorite. Everything is thought out and spiced and prepared just right.  It really is a labor of love for this little home. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Not any Dairy Free options.. so I guess BUTTER or maybe CREAM are a key ingredient in the rice, or in cooking the chicken .. or whatever.  They didn't seem to care much either.   That sucks.  This is the type of food that you can usually enjoy without riding the gross dairy train and feeling sick for days.   DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"LUV!!! I eat here whenever I am in LV,  Bring one to Socal pretty please! Would do great in the Anaheim Packing District..."}
{"text":"What a great place. Exceptional food. Amazing staff. Considerate owner. Guests won't leave. We waited almost an hour for our reservation... because the first party of the evening wouldn't leave. The taste of the food items were great. From brined cucumber to one hour egg to bone broth and fried chicken amazing. Thanks Jenny and staff."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Food was real good and the service was even better. Around the corner from the Fremont Casino Strip.  This is a MUST if your ever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've had various takes on Hainan Chicken Rice during travels throughout Asia; Chef Su's version was very, very good. As others have noted: this dish is poached and served with the skin on; I don't eat skin, but my dining partner was more than happy to take it off my hands. We added an a la carte organic egg which was a great call; it was exquisite in its simplicity, and though I'm not a huge rice fan, theirs was delicious as was both the house made pickles and accompanying sauces.   The fried chicken \"Bao Chicka Bao Bao\" was off the hook delicious! Moist chicken, crispy coating, crunchy kale slaw, a fluffy bun = this is what fried chicken should be. It is a 'chicken sandwich' for those who care about the quality of the food they eat, rather than the $1 menu, or an inexplicable devotion to fast 'food' chicken.   If ever you thought that organic produce and protein was a waste: just tasting the difference in the quality of Mary's Free Range fowl, and aforementioned egg will make a believer out of skeptics. Sheridan and Jenny are doing great things in this small lunch spot, definitely worth a trip, for visitors or locals.   * Hainan Chicken Rice is the dish everyone is flocking to *   ** top quality, organic, Mary's Free range chicken served here! **  *** same couple, Sheridan & Jenny who own Fat Choy; super friendly service! ***  **** lunch only, very small spot ****   ***** do not miss the chicken bao! *****"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place twice to see if anything had changed, the service stands out the most, or lack of service.  We would sit and wait and not a single person would come up to us.  I finally got up and asked a group of workers talking who was our server, this should not happen.  We ordered the poached chicken signature dish and our chicken was raw and pink not to mention cold.  When I told our server she said \"that's the way its supposed to be\"  I said raw chicken is not healthy.  She offered us another dish and my wife opted for the Roasted chicken which was very tough and chewy.  I don't think we will be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"This is a (somewhat) hidden gem right off of the north end of the strip.  Absolutely worth the trip to find it.  As you'd expect, the Hainan Rice is world class, but the Sambal Chicken Wings and Buttermilk Fried Chicken Bao are also exceptional.  If you're lucky enough to be there on a day that Jenny is as well, you'll also leave learning about the dish and what inspired her and her husband to set up shop on Sahara.  An all around excellent lunch spot."}
{"text":"Never thought that such an amazing restaurant would thrive in a location like this.  With this quality of food and customer service,  you could open this place in the middle of Death Valley and the customers would line up at the door! Try the #2!!!!  10 stars if I could give it!"}
{"text":"Craving for chicken?? You're craving will be satisfied here. They are only open for lunch, but it's so good. You can get it poached (Hainanese style), roasted, or fried. I tried the poached style and it melted in my mouth. Chicken is juicy and the sauces are filled with flavor. The service is inconsistent, the cashier/server seemed irritated when we ordered & then became pleasant at the end. The great food and her attitutude turn around made this place a 5star!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  Ordered:  Fried chicken bao (recommend dipping in sambal sauce) Hainan chicken (added chinese sausage) Indo curry rice (no sauce needed, already salty but in a good way)  Everything is really delicious.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be here again. Experienced terrible customer service today. Came in on a busy day and the server introduced himself and told us that there were 3 in front of us. After 2 parties were seated, we went up to him thinking that it was almost out turn and wanted to order. Turns out he didn't put out name down and now will seat us AFTER other folks who came after us.  I tried to explain to him that it's not our fault that he didn't put out name on the list and not having the names on the list doesn't mean anything. But he won't listen. After much discussion, he said that if the table for 3 opens up first he will seat us. Well guess what, the table for 3 opened up and he combined it with other tables to accomod ate the party of 8 who came after us. That is incredibly poor customer service. This is so sad. I'm from Singapore and hainan chicken rice is dear to my heart. In Singapore or Malaysia, we would never treat our customers this way."}
{"text":"So happy to have this addition to Downtown Las Vegas. Chef Sheridan Su and Wife Operator Jenny know how to deliver great food and service.  Pretty simple for all you foodies out there. Great food with flavors you will not find anywhere else, great cocktails and service to boot. Come in, sit down, have a great meal or appetizer / drink at the bar and you will instantly become a fan.  The light not be great for pictures but it's great for eating and drinking with friends."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We absolutely love the original location but this location has more food offerings. We loved the edamame,broccoli quinoa salad, the poached chicken, and the chicken sandwich. All of the staff is so kind, and friendly. Flock and Fowl is one of our absolute favorites:)!"}
{"text":"We had such a great time at this restaurant. The staff is so helpful and friendly. We tried almost everything on the menu and we absolutely loved all of it. It's rare to find poached chicken as an option on a menu, and theirs is phenomenal. Lastly, the lemon tea was also fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Have already been to the first location they have on Sahara, decided to give this place another try at their new location in DT. Not too bad, but coming from Southern Cali, the hainan chicken rice isn't the same of course! I felt the rice was kind of bland, need a tad more flavor. Chicken was okay, portion was a bit small. Possibly a little bit more rice and couple more pieces of chicken would have been perfect. Their house sambal sauce isn't bad, definitely has a kick to it! If you like spicy then you'll enjoy the sauce!   Another dish I tried was the Laksa, not the same as I've had elsewhere, here they use much thicker noodle and can be very filling especially with the curry soup base. I only wish the soup was hotter, by the time it came to my table it was warm and not pipping hot!  But worth the try!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with coworkers and had the fried chicken tender bao. It was absolutely amazing!!! Pictures don't do the food served any justice. The dressings and sides are too good for words to describe. Everything comes out nice and fresh and nicely presented. The chicken isn't greasey for being fried and very tender"}
{"text":"Hainan chicken is really tasty. Fast and friendly service.  Look forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"It took us a little while to find this place, but it was so worth the extra steps.  I had the Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice and it was the best $15 spent in Vegas this trip.  The bone broth was flavorful, 1 hour egg over plain rice done right and poached chicken with a variety of sauces. The entire meal was magical. My friend tried their curry noodles and also loved every bite. For dessert we opted for a couple of craft cocktails. Great night! Very happy! Find this place, it's worth the hype."}
{"text":"This place is certainly of an up-and-coming wave of modern-fusion spots around Vegas, and offers some great chicken and rice dishes. Service was warm, welcoming, and informative, very helpful overall. We ordered the Buttermilk Chicken Rice, Crab-Chicken-Kimchi Fried Rice, and a bao, all of which were solid dishes.   The chicken is nothing crazy; the dish highlights the meat without much spice. Nice breading, cooked well, fresh-tasting meat. The sauces make it great, plating's nice as well. Garlic, chili, and scallion sauces, my favorite was scallion. Not too oily. If you like fried chicken, with a light, crispy breading and juicy interior, accentuated by great sauces, this is the item for you.  The bao was awesome; it was a traditional soft bao bun with a buttermilk tender, some greens, and sweet sauce. I preferred the bao to the tenders alone.   My favorite was the fried rice, but if I went again, I would not order it. The dish was entirely without crab, with three or four small pieces of chicken, despite being $12.99. Tons of kimchi. I enjoyed it, and won't hold it against them for the strange meat proportions, as I hurried them and asked for it to go last-minute. Ultimately, the prices are too high for food that many would not consider constituent of a dinner meal.  Pretty good food, overpriced, good service. 3/5"}
{"text":"I wanted something fresh and healthy and different. This hidden treasure on Sahara blew my mind, far exceeding expectations.   By keeping the menu simple they seemed to focus on perfecting their recipes. I got the half chicken and rice and the flavor was rich without being too salty and so juicy that when I tried to pick it up the bone slid right out. I generally avoid white rice but their chicken rice was inhaled before I even realized what happened. The in-house chili sauce stole the show. Flavorful with a hint of spice, I could have started drinking it it was so tasty.   The decor & dining area is cute but very small so not a place for parties but the service was fast and friendly and very clean and the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pros- Truffle fries and the dipping sauce we so good. Would highly recommend over all other menu items we ordered.  There were good sized portions but the menu was small and my entree of poached chicken is not something I'd recommend. Others had fried chicked, looked more appealing."}
{"text":"It's not often that people leave the strip when visiting Las Vegas. The shiny and luxurious hotels are filled with eateries by world-class chefs and restauranteurs. A few hotels boast delicious buffets that are the selling points for many tourists who stop by.  We actually decided to venture off the strip to try out a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant called Flock & Fowl. Typically we try to take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt, but this place definitely earned every one of its stars and rave reviews.  From our hotel on the strip, we hopped in an Uber and arrived in under 10 minutes at a tiny strip of stores. Nestled next to a costume shop and theme wedding specialty store, Flock & Fowl is quite the hidden gem.  Online reviews tout its authentic Hainanese style eats and delicious free-range chicken. Asian food and chicken? Check and check.  We walked into the small restaurant that could probably seat close to 30 people at the most. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the staff with a \"Welcome!\" and huge smile. \"Have you been to Flock & Fowl before?\"  The staff up front gave us a detailed breakdown of how their menu worked, explained what food items were specialties, and pointed out customer favorites. Each member of their staff that spoke to us was super friendly AND helpful in a way that made us feel like they really cared about sharing their love for the food they made with us.   Our meal started with an appetizer of wings, thai caramel chicken wings with crispy garlic to be exact. They were some of the best pieces of fried chicken I've had in my lifetime. They reminded me a little of Korean fried chicken wings - the perfect balance of sweet, salty, crispy and juicy. My mouth is legit still watering thinking about these guys.  Our main courses came shortly after. Roasted Spring Chicken for me and Buttermilk Fried Chicken Tenders for him. Everything on the plate was a 10/10, from the chicken to the pickled vegetables to the rice to the sauces.     Flocking delicious? I'd say so.  Next time you have a chance to visit Sin City, venture off the strip and give Flock & Fowl a try. I'm definitely going to go off the beaten path every time I travel in the hopes that I'll find a cute, unassuming restaurant with food as amazing as this place has!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely awesome. What a surprise to eat on our last night in LV. What stood out more than anything else was that the waiter was one of the best we've ever had in a restaurant. He was attentive and you can tell he cares about the patrons. Like deep down care about our experience. I also liked that they do not accept cash here. Cash really needs to go away."}
{"text":"Tried to go for the first time took it to go. Ordered the number 1. Plain food would not recommend. Will try something else next time."}
{"text":"I decided to start giving my own Michelin and AAA diamond wannabe rating because what makes them better then me? Never mind, too much to think about and scale so eff it. I gave this place 4 stars because the food was AYTE, I mean don't get me wrong it was good, damn good, amazing, the chicken was poached to perfection and the chicken bao was on point BUT I'm a hater and I nitpick on things like the place too small, it doesn't have a restrooms; the wait is too long, closed too early, etc...  I read a lot of comments saying this is the best, it might be for some; to each its own, like if you never had a hamburger before and you go to McDonalds and you were like this is the best... or you've never tried Chinese food and went to Panda Express thinking that was the bomb...  Anyways; not saying this isn't the best for these people just saying that there is always something better.   Well I'm going to go here again because I'm also a hypocrite!"}
{"text":"Over the top on flavor profiles and staff knowledge of the food preparation .... a must visit chow stop, small with limited space and no beer or wine.; but keep it rocking it folks!"}
{"text":"This is our second day in a row eating here and is my wife's and my new favorite spot. The food here is soo good!!! The place is beautifully executed and the ownership is so kind! Jenny is such a great and caring server/ owner/ operator and her husband is the bomb chef. My only critique is she can be overly apologetic when honestly she has nothing to apologize for. The work they do here is great! Keep up the good work y'all and don't point out any mistakes, because people don't see them.   - Jupiter and Abby"}
{"text":"My daughter was visiting and spotted this place while on foot with her friends.  She ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice ???? with one hour egg & bone broth.  I got the Flock Chicken Sandwich w/fries.  We sampled one another's plates & both meals were delicious!  The service was good & except for them attempting to sit a couple with a dog behind us ( after dog came sniffing on his leash they reseated them) all was ok."}
{"text":"Like I said, I support great small family owned businesses and when the owner follows us out after we left to say goodbye, well it deserves special mention!    The owner was so friendly and helpful with the small menu (they only do a few things but they do them well).  Hainan chicken rice is their specialty so you have to start with that.  We ordered the chicken wings as well and it was very flavorful and fatty (ugh) but good.  I had the vietnamese coffee and it was small for a large but at least it wasn't so sweet that you felt like you were drinking just condensed milk.  The favorite wing flavor was the sriracha honey wings for us so get 8 of those.  My only recommendation is to lower the price on your \"perfect egg\" which was a $2.99 option while a regular poached egg was $1.99.  These optional upcharges for each item is annoying.  Also, the place is difficult to get to since it is next the I15 freeway on Sahara and you can only get in one way but I get it, the rent is cheaper.  Give them a try so they can do better and get into a better location.  Their food certainly reflects a more deserving higher quality locale."}
{"text":"The indo-fried rice is soooo good. Small dining area but huge on flavor and taste. Jenny the owner is also very personable and shares her love for food with her guests. It's a bit off the strip but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I've found it difficult to come out here because of their limited hours, but finally made it in for brunch on the weekend. Flock & Fowl is one of those concepts that would have huge 2+ hour long waits in cities like NY and SF, but lucky for us Vegas locals, this place is located in an older strip mall west of Las Vegas Blvd and although a fairly small location, the wait isn't bad at all. Hainan chicken used to be one of my favorite things to eat in college and their elevated version of this dish is worth the visit. I was a  bit hesitant to only have poached chicken, but lucky for us all, they serve some well done fried chicken skin here as well. The bao buns weren't my favorite part of our meal since I've had better versions at other restaurants in Vegas and the greens were a bit bitter for me. During our visit, Kaya Toast was available as one of their rotating specials, which my husband enjoyed with an perfectly cooked egg on top. There seems to always be something new to try here. This location is temporarily closed right now, but not to fear, they just opened up a Downtown Vegas spot!"}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe of this place.  Everyone was super friendly.  We got there right at 5pm since that's when it opens, and we wanted to have enough time to eat/savor/get to Hamilton on time.  Bonus: happy hour!  Half off appetizers.  Ordered: *wings (honey butter and salt & pepper) ...so good!  It doesn't say on the menu, but the pepper is sichuan/szechuan.  It was the first thing I tried so it made the other food taste different...believe me it's delish, but just warning that you might want to save this for last if you don't want to alter the taste of the rest of the food.  I waited til the numbing subsided to start on the other things....  *Kaya toast...flavor took me back to childhood since I'm half filipino.  They spread coco jam onto brioche and top with fried egg.  My mom used to make me coco jam toast when I was a kid...reminded me it existed and need to pick some up to let my daughter try it :)  *farmer's market salad....this was just, ehhhh....produce was fresh but dressing didn't seem seasoned, and just oily.  *hummus....YUM cuz it's accompanied w/ green onion pancakes.  (plus celery and carrots)  We didn't use the hummus up, so I wanted to ask for more pancakes, but was full.  Note: they have a fried chicken bao bun for free w/ Yelp check in.  We didn't use it, since apps were half off and I'd feel like El Cheapo if I did.  Next time I do dinner, will definitely use it!"}
{"text":"Food was cooked to perfection. We enjoyed the cauliflower soup with chicken wings as our apps and then moved onto the wonderful chicken sandwich with slaw the chicken sauce all three were banging and very tasty and savory! We topped the evening off with a cookie and ice cream with a miso sauce which tasted so damn good! My fiancé described the flavors from the cookie and ice cream as a \"triumph in her mouth!\" Well done Chef Rizzo and wait staff! We will be back again soon. Parking was also very cheap and we parked right in front of the restaurant and the kiosk took credit cards. Easy Peasy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the owner handled the front of house flawlessly. Great customer service in a very casual eatery."}
{"text":"I am not giving this a Four/Five star because the Singaporean Chicken and Rice did not impress me but maybe this is because I am comparing it to the one I had in the street stalls of Bangkok (Street stalls in RCA). I gave them a try because not many places in the States even serve this dish especially here in Iowa. I thought the rice needed a little more flavor and the sauces need more spice and flavor. I also tried the Thai wings, it was just A-OK. I thought it was too sweet for my liking. This is a small place so get there early before the big rush. All in all I would still recommend this place if you haven't had Singaporean chicken and rice before. But if you had one from Thailand, than you might be kind of disappointed.  Food - 3/5  It was okay nothing to really rave about here.   Service - 5/5  Waitress and Cashier was really helpful. They explained everything on the menu before we ordered since we told them it was our first time there. You actually order before they sat you at a table. Service was great."}
{"text":"Great benefit from checking in on Yelp! Hearty Chicken Bao was free & the highlight of our meal. Tasty fried chicken wings, tenders, and salad addition. Yummm for chicken lovers!"}
{"text":"Sad news, I'm moving. The good news, I've been on a \"Vegas Foodie Bucketlist, was\"  and the Flock and Fowl was just checked off the list.   This chicken place is in an old business park that my mom used to work in back in the 90's; the location is off-putting, but the food is ridiculous. They offer three main items on the menu, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Thai Caramel Chicken Wings, and Night Market Bao Buns which is what I went with and they were amazing. Perfectly fried, super juicy, and the breading was something that would make the Colonel second guess his career choice. I honestly wanted to eat about three more these things, but decided not get Bao Bun wasted.   The side of the rice and egg was the perfect addition to the meal, the rice was just a tad on the sticky side, which I love, and the egg made for the perfect topping. Flock and Fowl are truly one of a kind and should be treated as so. I'm already planning my next visit, Hainanese Chicken Rice, I see you!"}
{"text":"Loved the original location and love this one even more! I love that this location is more expanded in both space and in menu.  The Lychee's Knees is a great cocktail. It's very well-crafted. One of those types of cocktails where you can kind of taste the alcohol but not really, and after you have 2, you feel like you've had 4!  I also had a cocktail that had tajin in it that was fabulous. Good choice for anyone who likes a little heat/spiciness in their drink.  Hainan Chicken Rice, great of course! I will admit that I like the chicken rice from the original location a bit more, but they had that process down there like a well-oiled machine. I expect the same from the DTLV location in the months to come. Can't get enough of their house-made ginger scallion and sambal.  Laksa: love the texture of the noodles and the broth is so hearty and flavorful! The prawn is huge and super juicy. Highly recommend this dish.  Shrimp rolls: delicious and so crunchy! Be careful, these come out HOT!  Kaya Toast: so great with the egg on top! They were out of foie gras when I went so I'll have to come back and try it with that.  All-in-all, a wonderful experience. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been following Chef Sheridan Su and his wife since they had their bao shop in a hair salon. I am a huge fan of Hainan chicken rice and was so stoked when I heard they were opening this joint. Their Hainan chicken rice is the best in Vegas. The best part is the sauces which are all made in-house. And who can forget the broth? Delicious! Can't wait till I'm back in Vegas so I can visit again. Yum!  Love."}
{"text":"The larka was delicious. So flavorful, the curry had a slight kick at the end. Definitely get if you come here. The all natural bacon cheeseburger was bursting with flavor. You can tell they marinated their meat. The curly fries are worth it, definitely order as an appeti"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of Las Vegas best kept secrets.  The flavors are awesome!!! The wait staff is very friendly, they explain the whole menu in detail.  I love the decor.  The traditional Hainanese chicken rice is to die for and a poached egg."}
{"text":"Best new restaurant in Las Vegas! Located a block from the hip Fremont St East district, Flock & Fowl serves delicious Asian-fusion food, every item on the menu is a winner, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, gorgeous bar area with a stellar wine list. Currently having a love affair with their \"Laksa\" a curry based noodle soup that is absolutely outstanding. A must for foodies in Las Vegas and out-of-towners who want to explore the burgeoning Off-Strip Las Vegas food scene!"}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem - wedged in a small strip mall (located due west of another small strip mall where Golden Steer is located), it can be hard to find the first time.  And if you want a seat inside, as well as a parking spot, you've got to get there early.  There is no restroom inside, so make sure you arrive prepared.  The food is excellent, but be ready for a larger bill than you might imagine, especially if you opt for some add-ons.  The bao is very good, but this is Sheridan's restaurant so they had better be good!  The service is on-point, and they do a good job of remembering the name you give them when ordering.  They use your name when delivering food to your table, and when you depart the restaurant.  It's a nice touch and makes me feel appreciated.  The specials seem to be the way to order, but the chicken and rice plate is a solid standby.  Stay away on Monday - they're closed!"}
{"text":"I was hungover as f*** but hungry and wanted some chicken soup, so I looked through Postmates and took my chances ordering food from here. I got the chicken rice with an egg, and a cup of broth.   Boy, was I amazed! The chicken was tender and the rice was flavorful and non-oily. I love eggs with anything so I was happy and surprised that they had the option of adding an egg to my meal. The best part about the chicken was that it was boneless, which made it easier to eat and enjoy. You don't find that very often at Asian restaurants that serve the Hai Nan chicken rice! I liked the three sauces that they included with my order too. 5/5 for the food and delivery from Postmates, 4/5 overall because I haven't been to the actual restaurant yet. But definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't even describe how wonderfully delicious everything that comes out of this restaurant is!  I crave it!  Even the chicken broth is bomb haha the staff is great as well,  they remembered me after only two visits. If you haven't had their chicken or seasonal salad yet,  I implore you to! I have never craved a salad so badly before. I'll forever be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This place had rave reviews so we decided to try it. Found out they had run out of Hainan Chicken at 2pm, which I found odd given how early it was. The service was friendly and the place was packed, but you can tell they weren't equipped to handle a full house.   The food took a bit of time but tasted great. The Thai caramel wings were sweet and savory and the fried chicken baos had good flavor and crisp. The Viet iced coffee, however, was way too watered down and lacked the nuttiness you usually find.   All in all, the place has good potential and the chicken was delicious. But, I think there's some improvements that could be addressed."}
{"text":"The #2 Buttermilk Fried (Chicken) Tenders were cooked really well, and like another Yelper said, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. All plates are served with house made ginger scallion sauce + house made soy + marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens. Though cooked perfectly, the tenders didn't have a ton of flavor themselves, which is where the soy sauce comes in. It was a very good combo, but the soy sauce was very salty and there were 4 or 5 decent sized tenders, so it didn't last the entire meal. I really wish they'd had some sort of Hainan Province inspired BBQ-type sauce.   The presentation was phenomenal! Just 4 meals on the menu when we visited, plus a few add ons. And no bathrooms in-house. Decently priced too!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas from Portland, where at least 4 places serve world-class fried chicken. Did some research on lunch spots and found raves about chicken at Flock & Fowl. Easy to locate. Welcomed warmly by the staff - really appreciated their genuineness. Ordered the chicken bao with an add-on quail egg. Wowed by the whole thing - extra-crispy chicken, pillowy bao wrap, crisp greens, and a firey, savory, gingery hot sauce. Had to come back the following day to try the tenders with chicken rice. Another excellent meal - enjoyed the pickles and lemongrass sauce. The friendliness of the staff made the experience even better."}
{"text":"A genuine bomb-ass transport of Singapore!  I wasn't expecting such an authentic interpretation of the Hainan chicken but flock and fowl delivered and MORE.  The good is amazing.  Spend $9 instead of the plane ticket to the hawker markets of Singapore. It's that good.  And friendly as hell owners who go out of her way to make sure ur taken care of.  Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place pretty much lives up to the hype.   Got an iced Vietnamese coffee which was bomb. Should be advertised as 1 shot or 2 shots rather than 16 or 24 oz because it's traditionally prepared and not specifically made to fill up the cup. So just know it will be about 2/3 full. But so good got one to go.   Ordered the Fried Chicken Baos. They were as good as they look. We ended up ordering more after we were done eating.   Also got the poached chicken with rice. Added an egg, fried chicken skins, and broth. Sooo good. The chicken does come luke warm based on how it's prepared. So definitely be aware of that before ordering. Sauces are really good too as well as the rice. Would probably not order this again and opt for the fried chicken or maybe one of the specials but glad I tried it.   Want to go back and try the Indo fried rice and the chicken wings.   Service was really great. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wishes have been granted and I no longer need to make a 4-5 hour drive to LA to go to Savoy Kitchen for my favorite Singaporean treat - Hainan Chicken and rice.  This is hands down the best hainan chicken and rice I've ever had.  A few other places in town serve it but the quality, preparation, execution, and flavor don't come close to Flock.  The chicken is silky smooth, moist.  Rice is fragrant with chicken essence.  I love pouring some of the rich broth over and the sauces are ridiculously good.   Love the ginger scallion and the chili packs a punch but you can then pair it with the sweet soy.   The chicken wings are bursting with soulfulness - i used to work on this side of town- i wish I did bc I would be here 3-4x a week.  That's how much I love hainan chicken and rice.   Check out Anthony Bourdains Singapore trip to the hawker centers to see what this is all bout if you don't know about hainan chicken and rice."}
{"text":"I got chance to try this cute place finally since i was morning person because they opened till 3.30 pm . So we ordered 3 chicken rice add Chinese sausage &fried chicken skin ,2 indo fried rice , 4 honey siracha ckicken wing 4 thai wings and 1 fried chicken boa . All for togo the staffs were nice she help explanation from the menu from the wall which is i took little time to combine my order . What i like the most is indo friedrice The food took not too long . The place decorations easy and cute . But i missed the desert  because they said they were out of it :/"}
{"text":"What an amazing place that is literally a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd.    Where to start?    First, the food:  The artisanal care and love to their Hainanese Chicken Rice is apparent from their house made sauces that accompany the dish to the use of organic chicken sourced from San Joaquin Valley (and cooked to perfection, juicy, tender and flavorful), to the chicken rice that is seasoned well and balanced.     The Thai Caramel chicken wings were amazing - lemon, ginger, garlic with sweetness from the honey , along with a crispy crunchiness.  In San Francisco there is a restaurant that serves generally mediocre food yet has long lines and less than desirable service day in and day out because of its chicken wings.  Flock and Fowl wins out hands down.   Second, the service:    Most small places have a great signature dish but lack service.   Here it's sort of an hybrid.  You sit down, decide what you order and go to the counter area to place your order and pay by cash or credit (via their Clover POS).  The food and beverages are otherwise served as expected at table service restaurants.  But what sets Flock and Fowl apart, elevating it to the top is what I witnessed during the 55 minutes I was their.   Jenny the front of the house knew the names of many of the customers that came to eat as well as what they normally order and their preferences.  This wasn't just one customer but at least 5 customers. This demonstrates a commitment to not only food but to providing great customer service.  If only there was something like Flock and Fowl in the Bay Area (Peninsula), I would dine regularly.    Note to Flock and Fowl:  If you do open up in the Bay Area, let me know, please."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this spot for awhile and finally got around to trying it this past weekend. It's in the Ogden downtown in the old Itsy Bitsy space. The atmosphere is very...downtown-y if you know what I mean. It takes a little away from the authenticity but the food more than makes up for it. We ordered the Son in Law Deviled Eggs to start. The combo of flavors on this was incredible. They were very lightly fried and the outsides become sort of tough and rubbery which is a nice contrast to the soft insides. I wish there was just a liiitle bit more of the tamarind glaze because the eggs are a little dry without it but no matter. This is a must order for sure.   For the main course I got the Hainanese Chicken poached of course with sides of daily veggies (edamame and daikon that day) and chicken bone broth. The chicken was incredibly juicy and well flavored even though you can't see any seasoning. My favorite of the dipping sauces was actually the soy. It went really well with the rice. I also loved the pickled vegetables (takana!) and would have glady had extra pickled instead of the vegetables. I enjoyed the chicken bone broth, it was nice to sip on between bites. This meal felt really clean and healthy and I would definitely come back and get the exact same thing again. My boyfriend ordered the laksa, which the waiter described as a \"ramen\" but I think that's a little deceiving. The noodles are more like a thinner udon in a curry broth that's dangerously yellow and easy to splatter on your clothes. The tofu in it was so so good though, soft and silky inside and chewy on the outside. My boyfriend wasn't very full afterwards though so maybe order something else if you're super hungry.   My only requests for Flock and Fowl are in the utensil/dishware department. We tried to get chopsticks with our meal and they said they ran out. I also think knives could be useful, since even though the chicken was pre sliced, some of the slices I didn't want to eat in one bite. Lastly, the dish the Hainanese Chicken is served on rotates about the middle and proves a bit difficult when you're trying to dip your chicken in the sauces. Other than these minor details the meal was fabulous and it was fun dining downtown. I've been thinking about that chicken for two days now so yeah... I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Vegas. Food is flawless. Fried chicken tenders are the best in Vegas without a doubt. The place is insanely small, in a strange strip mall, and one of the times I dined I was told that I may not be seated when my food was ready but they took my order and charged my card anyway (so weird, but it was probably just a crazy day). With all that being said, I will certainly be back...many times.   I'm horrible for not remembering her name, but they have an employee that is one of the most charming servers I have ever encountered. My first time at the restaurant she told me about all about the food, where it came from, etc. Every time I eat she gives me a rundown of my meal and I will never get tired of her describing the final component of the perfect rice: \"Lots of love.\" She's a true gem and Flock & Fowl is lucky to have her on staff. If I owned a restaurant I would be doing anything I could to convince this girl to come work at my joint. :)   Please open for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  The bartender made you feel right at home.  Who had chicken skins as an appetizer?  Flock and Fowl does.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This establishment is very clean and the staff are all very welcoming and patient. We were instantly greeted and the staff provided information so you are aware of what you're ordering.   If you're ever near the area, you definitely need to stop  by and grab a bite at this place. My boyfriend and I just so happen to stumble across the place because we were staying at the hotel nearby. We decided to explore and walk around - not a very good idea by the way because of the summer heat. But Flock and Fowl does offer a great selection of refreshments that will quench your thirst."}
{"text":"2016 is definitely the year of the hainanese chicken.   And flock and fowl has definitely brought it to las vegas.    The restaurant itself is small and very cute.  The ordering process is at the front, and you sit down and wait for you food. The chicken itself is very tender, and packed full of that cooked in its own fat and ginger flavor, as is the rice.  The sauces that come with the hainan chicken also complement the chicken flavor rather nicely.    It's off strip, so I recommend getting here early before the crowd."}
{"text":"I really like the food.  So much so that my companion and I brought many friends there.  I even brought my world traveler friend who is also a food lover.  After trying the Hainan chicken with rice, my friend commented that it was as good as what he ate in Singapore.  My companion and I love the salad with roasted chicken, chicken bao, and chicken wings.  I tried the indo-curry fried rice and loved it.  The staff are friendly.  The place is small and gets crowded fast around lunch hour."}
{"text":"My daughter Emily and I frequently crave for/eat at the Sahara location  we've been to the downtown location 2 times and love it! Decor so cool, food yummy! Addicted to the hainan chicken! The house made sriracha...ta die for! Cocktails on point! Anthony our server/family friend...awesometastik & adorable! So from now on we'll have to dine in downtown and get something to go from the Sahara location...Indo fried rice!!!! Can't wait to go back and try new things @ both locations!"}
{"text":"The place to go in Vegas for chicken rice!   Hainanese chicken rice is one of my favorite things to eat. EVER! It's a dish I grew up on Thailand, and to this day reminds me of being there. Yes it is more associated with Singapore than Thailand, but trust me there's many versions of it all over Southeast Asia. In Thai we call it khao mun gai, which literally translates to oily rice chicken. It's not commonly found in Thai restaurants, and when it is, it's not usually great. The chicken rice at F&F is pretty great. Chef Sheridan Su has perfected the rice! There are several options for the chicken- Traditional steamed/boiled chicken is what I prefer and most commonly served for this dish. He also offers fried chicken in the form of chicken strips, and roasted chicken which is served bone in.   I have tried all three and I enjoy all of them. I still prefer the traditional number one the most. And I definitely recommend adding an egg. There are several places around that country that strictly serve chicken rice, and this is one my favorites!"}
{"text":"Pretty good small restaurant in a unexpected place.  The menu is very small and limited.  But what they do sell is delicious and what they specialize in.  Chicken.  Must try the buttermilk fried chicken bao bun."}
{"text":"Don't have to get too deep when it comes to reviewing this spot. They nailed everything - killed all the senses but especially enjoyed the owner to customer experience... The pictures don't lie!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this location a few weeks before the health department permanently shut down this place for good.   I wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't. I first heard of flock & fowl through yelp and decided to come here when I was visiting the area.   Upon my visit on a weekday for lunch, we were notified the restaurant was only serving one thing, which was the popular favorite Hainanese chicken rice.  We requested two orders of the chicken rice dish...and had waited a looonnng time for our food. Overall, the food wasn't bad...I personally feel this place is overhyped.  Yes, the chicken was juicy and flavorful.  There were various dipping sauces (spicy and savory) and the dish came with a bed of rice, sausage and an egg.   What I found weird was that for a sit down restaurant....everything was served in plastic--our water cups, the takeout container our food came in, the utensils. I guess in retrospect, it all makes sense now if they had issues with the health dept which we were unaware of at the time.   In the end, the bill came out to be almost $40 after tax and tip. For the mediocre experience, I felt the price was too steep and could've been better spent somewhere else.   Perhaps my visit this one time was just an anomaly."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best chicken rice I've had outside of Singapore?  Certainly the fanciest - classic combo #1 with poached Mary's chicken, pretty presentation on a modern/hip matte black platter, trio of sauces on the side.  Recommend coughing up the $2 for dark meat only - a regulation-sized serving of sliced tender, tasty chicken with skin (and no bones - huge plus!).  The rice itself was fragrant and perfectly seasoned, accompanied with a pinch of pickles.  Only issue I had with F&F's star dish?  The broth should be part and parcel of classic Hainanese chicken rice - even if it's a perfunctory shot or teacup size - not some janky $1 surcharge...  The other dishes we tried were quite good - the chef's special duo of toast (pate with jalapeno jelly, duck confit with quail egg), buttermilk chicken tender bao, and the house salad.  It's not in a tourist-attractive part of town, but then again, none of the best tasting food in Las Vegas is.  Tiny seating area, very sweet service/staff, although the order process is numbingly slow for unclear reasons.  If you don't have time to linger over lunch, call your order in ahead of time for takeout.  Otherwise, big warning: there is no restroom.  Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"What a great find by my hubby!  This is a hole-in-the-wall in somewhat of a seedy strip mall less than 10 minutes by car from the strip.  It's small with 6 tables.  They do their signature Hainan Chicken rice incredibly well.  We both got the original and I paid $2 extra for the dark meat only.  The chicken is fresh, juicy, flavorful and did I say FRESH?  A chat with the friendly owner told me that the chicken has never been frozen and in fact they don't even have a freezer in the restaurant.  The chicken wings with Thai sauce were to die for!!! I saw a couple having the chicken buns and they look yummy.  Gotta try next time!"}
{"text":"Still the best Hainan chicken in the game! I just love everything about this dish, from its exquisite taste to its beautiful presentation. The chicken is organic and free range, and it is ridiculously soft and tender. The chicken fat rice is so flavorful, and the dipping sauces are the game changers, especially their house made chili sauce. I also got the Chinese sausage as one of my sides, and it complemented this dish very well.   Another one of Chef Sheridan's dishes you do not wanna miss out on is the Kaya Toast with foie gras. Served on a brioche toast which is made locally, it is topped with seared foie gras, a fried egg, and coconut egg jam. The dish is also decorated with their house sweet soy glaze and flowers, and it's just so pretty to look at! One bite of this, and I was in a state of pure bliss. So good!   The chicken wings (humongous) with honey butter and angry sauce were also really good, very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! The angry sauce reminded me of Korean chicken wings with a gochujang glaze. The Son-In-Law Deviled eggs with the tamarind glaze was bomb as well!  Service was amazing! The entire staff is so friendly and attentive. They also have a full bar now and are open for dinner. I tried the Le Grand \"flocktail,\" which is vodka with lime, honey, bitters, and Le Grand Courtage garnished with rosemary, and it was very refreshing. I also admire the decor and ambience. It's very hip, modern, and rustic, and has a downtown vibe to it. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Brought to you from chef Sheridan Su of Fat Choy, this place has some of the best chicken I've ever tasted! BUCUUCK! I have yet to try the poached Hainam chicken (they were sold out), but so far, I've had the roasted spring chicken, the Thai caramel chicken wings, the fried chicken baos, and the salad with the buttermilk fried chicken.   Roasted spring chicken- roasted to perfection. Skin was super crispy, but the chicken was moist, tender, and full of flavor. It comes with 3 sauces (a soy sauce base, chili sauce, and a ginger/scallion sauce) to really enhance its flavor. The chicken rice that came with the roasted chicken was really tasty as well.   Thai caramel chicken wings- a little bit fishy (maybe used too much fish sauce), but the garlic chips added a nice touch of flavor to it. I definitely want to try the Sriracha honey wings next time.   Fried chicken baos- loved the baos at fat choy, and the baos are renewed here at Flock and Fowl, with its own twist. The contrast between the crunchy and crispy buttermilk fried chicken and the softness of the steamed bun is created to perfect.   Salad with buttermilk fried chicken- I ordered this mainly to have some greens in the meal lol, but I enjoyed the sesame vinaigrette dressing on the salad. The salad portion is also very generous.   Service was great. Each of the dishes were explained in detail, and everyone was friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Hainan chicken rice! The fried spring chicken is great as well. They have Kaya toast!"}
{"text":"So simple, so good, so amazing and I was so sad when my meal ended.  This place is chicken revelation."}
{"text":"I've always gone to the Sahara location in the past year. Today my family and I decided to do some exploring in downtown. Thanks good we did as we found this gem. Love the very simple menu including the best Hainanese chicken in town in my opinion. Not a bad selection as well for the cocktails (flocktails) and beer!"}
{"text":"Liz and Amber were more than accommodating. The food was incredible. Amazingly high quality especially considering the reasonable prices! Thank you very much. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp. I was compelled to share my enthusiasm after having lunch here today. My wife selected this restaurant for its offering of Hainan chicken, which she loved. She added the chinese sausage, which was wonderful, and in her opinion, very authentic. The menu selection is very narrow, and I was reluctant to choose a dish. I went with the Cornish hen with salad, and added a chicken bao. The chicken bao was filled with their fried chicken tender. It was so good that I had to order another. The hen was very tasty, and the salad was extremely healthy and special. We ordered a lemon tea, which we fought over because it was so yummy. Jenny, the owner, was extremely polite, friendly, and helpful throughout our visit. Ten thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  Food was very good.  Have never had a good hainan chicken in Vegas besides the original Flock and Fowl.  Their new location may top that, making it more of an entree rather than a small lunch portion.  The hainan came with a seasonal veggie, fried egg on the rice, and a few dipping sauces.  The chili was probably the standout, but none of the sauces were must have.  We also had the laksa which was really a phenomenal dish. Everything about it was good.  Hearty portion, full prawn, thick noodles, interesting sweet flavor, and perfectly cooked chicken.  Finally, we had a few wings that we ordered extra extra spicy.  This was my one complaint as far as food went during our visit.  We ordered extra spicy for the laksa snd the wings and were left pretty unimpressed.  The wings tasted like sriracha and the laksa didn't have any extra spice.  Flock and Fowl has the food, but don't expect to sweat.   This place has an interesting cocktail menu and about 10 beers. Seemed like a full bar as well with a few wine options.  Prices are typical of the area with all around $8-11.   Service was al over the place.  We had at least 4 servers total and they had no idea what was going on from the dishes on the menu, to what the restaurant specialized in, to the drinks behind the bar.  We ordered chicken wings to come out first as an appetizer and inevitably they came out last.  We ordered extra spicy and they at first came out half soy glaze half spicy, having to return and recook them.  After the hectic meal where we waited for 3/4 of the meal before eating, we ended up being comped a cheesecake that we didn't want.  Nice that they want to make it up, but erasing an appetizer price is a much easier and better gesture for us.    In all, Flock and Fowl is a mainstay and great destination for food in Vegas.  Good for a dinner before Fremont, but service could use an upgrade."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  They have a very simple menu of chicken on rice (few varieties to choose from), chicken salad, wings, or bao.  They also have a few chef specialties as well.  The entire menu sits at $10 or less for the meal.  The restaurant itself is a tiny little shop with about 10-15 tables and unfortunately no bathroom.  And they are only open during lunch.  The chicken was very authentic and had nice texture and flavor.  I had the salad which turned out to be much bigger than expected (i.e. 2 meals).  Given the size, $10 is a great deal for the quality.  The salad itself matched any other restaurant in town as it came with fresh fruit, nuts, and varieties of salad inside.  The place seems like it could get crowded during lunch and tables may be tough to find.  I got there around 1pm and there was a few group wait to be seated.  All in all, if you're looking for some authentic Hainan chicken, I would recommend stopping by for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the same owner as the one that used to be on Sahara but I'm pretty sure it is. I came on Saturday for their Hainan Chicken Rice. We also ordered the Chicken Wings (Angry Sauce and Honey Butter) and  Son In Law Eggs to share with the table. For the wings, I like the flavor of both sauces but if I had to choose, I would choose the honey butter. The crispy skin was awesome and the chicken was still juicy. The presentation was also clean and simple. The Son In Law Eggs were disappointed. It expected the shell to be crispier with maybe some type of panko breading and the flavor to be stronger but the eggs just tasted like eggs and it tasted like the sauces were non-existent. Finally the Hainan Chicken Rice. First, it took over an hour to get the chicken rice. We assumed the kitchen was just giving us time to finish up our apps before bringing us our entrees but we were well done with our apps and our entrees were nowhere to be seen until we asked the waiter to check on it. Once we got them, the sides that I have chosen were not given. He was willing to switch it up for me though. As for the taste, the chicken and rice were both decent but nothing to rave about. The sauces were also ok but they felt one dimensional. The sides were strange in IMO. The daily veg was corn in what tasted like a smashed black bean sauce. The one hour egg was OK and the Chinese Sausage was probably one of the worst Chinese sausages I have ever had. In addition to all of this, the entire dish was lukewarm at best. For something like this, the dish should come out piping hot. Overall, I was once again let down by Flock & Fowl. New location, new look, but same mediocre food."}
{"text":"Flock and Fowl. Clever name and great concept for Vegas. Hainan chicken rice? Where else can you get that here? Not in Chinatown... Flock and Fowl opened recently and I found it while looking thru my Yelp thread of notifications. It is located in a small and old shopping center near the SLS and the I-15.  The place is small with a handful of tables. You place your order at the counter and then grab a table. The menu is small with a few dishes that the chef specializes in. We ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and the Fried Cornish Hen with Rice.  We also got a cup of chicken soup for 25 cents.  The meal came out to around $25 with tax and tip.  The meal came out pretty quickly, which gave you enough time to grab a table, enjoy some water or any other drink you ordered, and to enjoy the cute and minimalistic decor.  For the food, the Hainan chicken rice was decent. The rice was pretty good; it was cooked with chicken broth so it was moist and pretty flavorful. The chicken was not dry and you get a pretty good portion.  It also comes with some pickled veges and also some salted veges.  Finally it comes with a combination of sauces (soy, chili, and ginger oil).  The dish was OK. Nothing too amazing but also nothing to really dock it for.  It just felt average. The Cornish hen was a half fried bird with the same accompaniments as the Hainan chicken (except for the sauces).  Instead you get a spice and salt mixture with a slice of lemon to sprinkle and squeeze on your hen.  Compared to the other cornish hen dishes I've had with red rice, this dish was also just average. The hen was not dry nor overly oily but it also lacked the savory finger licking flavor I was expecting. Same goes for the chicken broth. It wasn't needed and it lacked flavor that could elevate the meal.  Overall, the meal was average.  Your taste buds will be satisfied but they won't be wanting chicken over and over again.  The service was good and you see the effort the owners put into the food but the food is still just average.  Hopefully the chef does a bit more research to perfect the flavor because it seems to be almost there but still missing that special something.  The store hours are short so check before you decide to head on over. Also, no restrooms so don't come with a full bladder unless you want to go find a restroom at a store next door."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and cocktails.  Downtown hot spot and a must try.  Owner, bartender and hostess were very helpful and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the small space, the intimate relationship between food, server and guest... i love the authenticity of the hainanese chicken and how it is served perfectly portioned sizes for the modern on-the-go city person! I've been to Manila and Singapore, and I must say--the hainanese chicken lives up to its historical flavor and taste just as it was from around the world! Global taste in this restaurant! A MUST TRY. now--GO EAT!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Flock & Fowl for their signature chicken rice dish for quite some time. We always get seasoned rice with poached chicken, chinese sausage, 1 hour egg and crispy skin. The chicken is always cooked just right. The rice is always well seasoned. With their second location, their creativity shows. We love all and every single item on the menu. They take comfort food and turn it into another level. We love coming here, their customer service is always on point. Everyone should come and give them a try."}
{"text":"YUM. Always going to be one of my faves. Their hainan chicken is like no other. It literally melts in your mouth. I always get the dark meat for an extra $2 but its worth it. Really great quality chicken here. I always ask for extra sauce. Seems like they don't give enough. Chinese sausage on the rice is also ++++ Their rice is yummy."}
{"text":"Everyone is super nice and friendly here. The food is good but portion size is a bit small. I had to order an extra side of rice ($2.99) with my Hainanese chicken rice ($14.99). But I still didn't have enough chicken. If they gave 25% more food per dish, it would be perfect.  Laksa ($16.99) was a bit too spicy for my taste and I already asked for no chili oil. Again, it's a small portion of food. Maybe just more noodle and sauce would do it.  Milk tea ($4.50) was good but I had to ask for more sweetener.  Great place with good food and service. Just small portions."}
{"text":"Little place in downtown with very interesting flavors. I went for the laksa cause I'm usually trying to hunt down the best one in town. It was definitely unlike a laksa I've had before, less soupy, but bursting with flavors, had a lot going on for sure, so five stars for that! Didn't love that room temp chicken with rice tho (hainese chicken) cause we got the traditional version and I guess that's how it's supposed to be; and the recommended bone broth soup to go with it, but just wasn't outstanding or flavorful chicken, though it came with rice and condiments.  With the yelp check in did get a free buttermilk chicken bao and that was a great little crunchy appetizer to get started with!"}
{"text":"Great location, cool modern yet comforting theme. The Bao was good just needed some sauce. Wings were standard, nothing too special.  Customer service was great."}
{"text":"Wow talk about some good organic chicken the food is off the charts good. This is the place to go when you want your stomach to thank you. A great little lunch spot off the Strip. Get there early they're only open for lunch. (for now) The food is so fresh and tender you would think the chickens are in the backyard.   I love the chicken bao & the wings. The fingers are homemade and delicious. Can't forget about the rice with a side of chicken broth. Who would have thought rice could be this good.    Jenny's presentation is so professional she explains all the love that goes into the food. it's really an awesome experience one of my favorite new spots. It should be a must on every Las Vegas foodie list.   It's so good my son gets off the video game when I come home with wings from Flock and Fowl. Haha"}
{"text":"Hainan chicken? A 626 phone number? I was really hoping this place would be the Las Vegas version of Savoy (located in LA), but I was left disappointed. My boss told me that this was a hipster fusion joint and he was right.  I tried the Night Market Fried Chicken Bao with a quail egg, Hainan Chicken Rice, and side of chicken broth. The bao here makes for a bangin Instagram, but leaves much to be desired. The description is \"5 spice buttermilk chicken,\" but honestly really had no flavor. Also my fault for getting fried food to go, but the outside of chicken got soggy from being steamed inside the to go box. While the outside got soggy, the inside was still dry. The quail egg on top was perfectly cooked, but the star should've been the chicken.   The Hainan chicken rice was okay. Not bad, but not amazing. For $9.99, it's decently priced. Honestly not much to talk about here. Chicken broth rice really had no flavor though.   I did not like the chicken broth at all. It was super salty and had a bunch of chicken fat in them ):   I will say that the staff here is stellar. They have really weird hours and close at 3:30pm, which I was not expecting. My coworkers and I were working an event at LV Convention Center and called in at 3:25pm and the guy who answered the phone was super nice and said it was totally fine to place an order. I showed up around 3:50pm and got the food with no issue. Maybe the food wasn't super because I came in right before closing? But if I were local, I'd probably give them another chance just because their staff is so nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Hainan Chicken rice. I think it was probably my first time having poached chicken. It was good, but not my favorite. The skin kinda creeps me out, but I think that is my own issue. I'm not deducting any stars because the food is too good and I think this is just a personal preference. The chicken was good and flavorful and I easily ate the whole dish. I really like the various sauces they give you to mix and match. Definitely some very interesting flavors.   The absolute standout was the grilled chicken tender Bao. The chicken was amazing. So good! I'm not much for those little sticky buns, but I do see why people love them. I really liked the extras that go along with it. Next time I going to try the grilled chicken tender Hainan rice. That might be my sweet spot!   I also tried a very good oolong ice tea. Customer service is great. Staff seems very friendly and like she personally cares if you enjoy your food. I'll definitely be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"In the world of vegas, Flock & Fowl is an awesome addition to the neighborhood.    Here's what we had:  Hainan Chicken w/ chinese sausage ($8.99, +$2 for chinese sausage, +$0.25 for broth): This was an excellent dish.  You can tell they chose quality ingredients because everything tastes very clean. Since when can you say chinese food tastes \"clean\"?  It's a very refreshing dish and contained the perfect amount of food.  I particularly enjoyed the garlic sauce, though it may be too spicy for some.  For those from the 626, the garlic sauce is very similar to Litz... which is one of my favorite restaurants.  They also have Sweet Soy sauce, so ask for that if your taste buds need something sweet to go with the spicy.  Fried chicken bao: The chicken was fried perfectly.  However, what really made this dish was the tangy slaw.    5 stars for this little oasis from Sin City."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! What a find in downtown Las Vegas. This is the bomb! While billed as a Singaporean restaurant, this place offers a fusion of cuisines that is just very creative and engaging.  The experience is first class right from the time that you set foot into the place to the time that you exit.  The host was friendly and welcoming with small talk thrown in.  The service throughout was exceptional.  Now let's talk about the grub.  The black miso garlic hummus: OMG. A perfect starter served with mini carrots and slightly sautéed pita pieces.  Spicy cucumbers were a reminder of good times in China.  The Laksa with seafood was one of the best I have had even in Singapore. And finally the spicy chicken sandwich just hit the spot.  The servers frequently checked in with us without being over bearing.  This is definitely going into my Las Vegas culinary Rolodex."}
{"text":"A small, specialty menu that is very popular. So much so that they ran out of chicken wings! Fortunately the poached chicken and fried chicken tenders we very good."}
{"text":"Great Hainan Chicken! For those who are familiar with Savoy's in Alhambra,  CA this is by far better!! But, unfortunately they do charge a fee for using your credit card. So a 4 star."}
{"text":"Came here while visiting the Fremont Street. The decor is nice and we were greeted well by the waiters. They had a really laid back, friendly vibe here amongst the workers.  The laksa was good with a good assortment of fried tofu, chicken, and one prawn, although the chicken could have been a little less dry. I would have preferred the laksa to be a bit more spicy, as it did get heavy towards the end. The one hour egg made it more savory and creamy.  My friend had the Hainanese chicken roasted and said that it was not seasoned very well, but it went well overall with the rice and different sauces that they gave. You can also choose 2 sides for this dish, including one hour egg, sausage or veggies.  Overall the food wasn't amazing but it's a good place to go to if you are in the area and wanting to try some Singapore cuisine. Also they are known for their flock tails if you are a drink person!"}
{"text":"I had a little downtime after an exam before needing to go to a conference at noon, so I decided to grab lunch at Flock & Fowl. The exterior is not that glamorous and it was actually a little tricky locating the shop since you have to approach it from a certain side of the street.  The interior is quite lovely, though on the small side. It reminded me of a coffee shop, even though it serves Chinese/Singaporean food. They only sell a few items, so a quick browse at the menu and you'll be good to go. You order at the counter so there is no waiter/waitress service.  I ended up getting the standard Hainanese Chicken Rice (you pick from four different chicken preparations, and I chose #1 - poached). I was intrigued by the bao so ordered one on the side. I also added the vegetable of the day (bok choy) to my chicken meal. I ended up getting my meal to-go due to limited time.  The food is a little pricey for what you get, but it was definitely very tasty! Given the atmosphere and the food itself, I'd probably consider this more of a fusion restaurant; nevertheless, it's certainly worth a try!  P.S. Flock & Fowl is only open for lunch Tuesday-Saturday, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"This place is good, foie gras on toast with egg is simple yet exquisite. Ask your server for drink pairings."}
{"text":"LQQKing to try something new & unique but tastes out of this world?  Look no further than here!!  Don't forget to seek out server Liz - she's so friendly & amazing you'll truly fall in love!"}
{"text":"Heard great thing about this place especially their wings from Doug the owner of art of flavors around the corner. Went in around 1. Tried ordering wings, but all sold out. The guy over the counter suggested the chicken tenders with the same sauce, turned that down quickly. Waitress/ hostess didn't look too happy when I tried to order food. Busy socializing with other coworkers.   Order the famous hainan chicken instead and the fried chicken bao. Brought out pretty quick. Both orders look super promising. Surprisingly the rice was way better than the hainan chicken. Wasn't that amazing like how reviews described. In my opinion they're good but I wouldn't call them the best in Las Vegas.   Ate and left."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant off the beaten path.  Crazy fresh, all organic ingredients!  The selection isn't large, but what they have they do well.  We will definitely be coming back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I liked the old location much better.  This one was a little too fancy for me.  I miss the homeliness of the old location.  It was so quaint."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great value for a place so close to the Strip. We always look for places that aren't your typical expensive Vegas eats....   Flock and fowl is still elegant looking but the food is actually good and the price is great!  Hainan chicken - tender and flavorful. Not as authentic as those in the SGV but pretty comparable. Rice was cooked perfectly and they give you both light and dark meat. Sauces were exactly what they were supposed to be... gingery and savory.   Fried chicken bao - perfectly fried chicken with just the right amount of sauce. This was just pillowy goodness all around!  Sriracha honey wings - most places do this wrong...  the sourness of the sriracha is overpowering. This was perfectly balanced.. sweet spicy with a bit of tang and not overly fried chicken  $30 for hainan chicken plus vegetable side dish and fried egg, fried chicken bao with quail egg and 4 pcs of sriracha chicken wings"}
{"text":"There's something beautiful about the simplicity of the food at Flock and Fowl. At first glance poached chicken might not sound very appetizing but their Hainan chicken rice is special. Fork-tender meat and bold flavors can be attributed to a broth crafted with precision and cared for with passion to create the best chicken dish in town. A touch of sauce on the rice provided sweet, intense flavors and three more house-made sauces accompany the dish for your dipping pleasure.  While that dish is my favorite on their small menu, the chicken bao is also exceptional and their buttermilk fried chicken tenders put all others to shame.  5 Stars"}
{"text":"This is such an unexpected find in Vegas! Their packed chicken rice is a must try: they made it such that their rice was fragrant and not too oily, chicken was tender and tasty, the sauces that came with it went really well with the rice and chicken. Eat them with the chilli, ginger and soy sauce- you won't regret it! We also ordered the chicken wings - Thai caramel and honey sirarcha. The Thai caramel was super yummy; I thought honey sirarcha would be the better between the two but Thai caramel was amazing!! Service was 5/5 Food 4.5/5 Location 4/5 - 4 only because they don't have toilets there"}
{"text":"So glad that they'll be bringing the full menu back to Sahara.  I raved about this place to friends and they were skeptical and think I overhyped it, but when they tried the Hainan chicken, they felt my praise was justified.  I'm in LA and lucky to go to Johnny Lee's Side Chick in Arcadia and Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra and the Hainan chicken here is up to par."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed with the lack of preparation this location had.  One thing after another the waiter had to make excuses for the kitchens lack of food!!  First thing we order soda,  which came in cans.  They ran out dr. Pepper ok no problem I'll take a coke.  We were told two items off the menu were not available.  The devil eggs and frits fries ok no problem.  Ordered the chicken rice which was good but they ran out of 1 hour egg so we opted for fried egg. How do you not have these items during your peak hour of 7pm baffles me.   Ordered the chicken wings with honey and crazy sauce were great  As were finishing waiter offers desert.  We opt for the cast  iron cookie and was told it would take 15 mins to make.  20 mins later no cookie and another excuse that the kitchen apparently burned the cookie. Time to get the damn check.  I get  the check and pull out cash and the waiter says we don't accept cash only card.  What the f*ck???  What do you want me to do at this point I am done with this bs. Waiter pulls out what looks to be his own amex card and pay for the bill while accepting my cash.  A nice gesture right?  Or is he trying to increase his card utilization to get higher minimum. At this point who the hell knows."}
{"text":"A newly open restaurant at downtown. The environment was super nice and the service was wonderful. I ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice, added fried egg and chicken broth as sides, which was absolutely amazing, even the details. Fully recommend."}
{"text":"One item on the menu, I order as the only customer there. Another couple come in, place the same order and get their food 5 minutes before me! The jacked-up teeth waitress says not a word to me until I ask for an update. \"What?\" \"Can I get an update on my food?\" \"Oh, theirs came out first.\" \"You have 1 item available on the menu!\" (They are apparently remodeling until May 22, and have a VERY limited menu (1 item). 5 minutes later, I get my to-go order. No apology. You must be kidding me. And $2 to add an egg to the order? Rude, poor customer service, over priced. I recommend you don't go here unless that's the sort of thing you like. Wish I could have my tip back, signed my receipt before the rudeness."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, good thing we had a rental because this is literally in a small strip mall type location. The restaurant is small and limited seating but there were a good amount of people there. We ordered two rice plates with traditional chicken with a 63 degree egg, chicken baos and green tea. The service is good here. The chicken plate was good as well and the rice was delicious! The sauces compliment the chicken as well. I fried chicken in the baos were tender and crispy on the outside, totally get these! Overall, the meal was good but I don't know if I would take taxi all the way out there to get it. If I have a rental then yes :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the hainan chicken with a side of chicken broth and Chinese sausage. The chicken is one of the best I've had. Very clean and tender without too much skin. The rice is soft and combines perfectly with the chicken. The chicken broth however was too salty for me. It was difficult too drink. Overall the food was great. The customer service and experience inside was also wonderful."}
{"text":"Yes, I finally made it today!!!  When I first came here, I was so excited to try their Hainan Chicken Rice, well too excited, I arrived here 5 minutes before their open time, 10:25 am. The girl told me they could not take my food order till 10:30 am but they could give me a water. I told her I would take a bottle of water. 5 minutes passed by, but no one said anything to me. I decided to wait till they say something to me. I waited and waited. It was 10:45. I went up to the counter and asked the girl if I could order food now. She said \"Oh, the health inspector is here now and she will be here for a while.\" OK. Why didn't she tell me that a little earlier... I paid for my water and left. Wasted 20 minutes.  The second attempt, I arrived here at around 1 pm, the prime lunch time. This place was sooo packed. All the tables were occupied and there were 5 people waiting at the counter. I left. I knew this place would've been packed at the prime lunch time so it was my fault.  Finally, today. I made sure I arrive here between 10:40 to 11:00. YES, YES, YES!!! I was successful. I ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice with everything except for the Chinese sausages. Oh my God, it was worth it, it paid off all that experience before. Absolutely delicious!! The chicken was soft and moist. The fried chicken skins were nice and crispy. The bok choy was seasoned so tasty. The three sauces were flavorful (I liked the ginger one). Mixing everything together, eating it and drinking the chicken soup was definitely my highlight of the day (HOTD)!! The owner Jenny was so attentive and so sweet. It's always so nice to see the owners so attentive and care about their businesses and customers like Jenny. I'll be back for either breakfast or take out!! Thanks, Jenny :-)"}
{"text":"A favorite lunch spot just off the Strip on West Sahara. Food is prepared gourmet style but the experience is cantina. Their fresh ingredients and unique recipes make this place a must for foodies. Lunch specials change daily."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat at the one on Sahara since it opened, but I've always worked late, so by the time I finally get moving around, it's closed. So I was excited that they opened one downtown that stays open, it was just a matter of going downtown.  And it was well worth the wait! Everything was great! Everything!  I got the check in special of fried chicken bao. It was delicious! Perfectly fried, soy sauce and sprouts in the bun, really good.  I got the Hainenese chicken special, cooked traditionally, and my partner got it with the roasted chicken. It comes with two sides. I chose the Chinese sausage (I *love* Chinese sausages!) and the bone broth. I mixed it all together, and it brought me back to my Vietnamese mom's chicken soup. Real comfort food. However, my partner's roasted chicken might have been the taste winner. Very flavorful. He also had the vegetables which he said were very good with the rice and chicken.  We didn't really have room for dessert but were offered a piece of ricotta toast. I don't even know how to explain it. It's not something you bite into and think, \"deelicious!\"; It's an experience. It has the non-flavor of bread and ricotta but then a sweet; but now savory; but that sweet bit again; but now some salty in that part of my mouth! If you like interesting food, absolutely do not pass this up if offered!   I'm terrible with names, as you may know, so I missed our server's name, though I know she told us. She is very new to the restaurant and the city, but she was so sweet and attentive, and I think besides her just being that way it also has to do with the work environment, which brings me to Jenny. As soon as we sat down, I noticed her seeming to have her kitchen on lockdown, excellent communication with everyone, including us regarding when our for would be out. I assumed she was one of the owners but didn't think to look it up at the time. It just seems there is a lot of respect between everyone and her command of her environment is such that if she would have handed me a bin and told me to bus a table, I totally would have  I had asked the server about someone who I thought worked there, and Jenny had come over to chat (kindly) about him.    I hope Jenny never gets tired   I loved this experience; food, service, atmosphere   It was Saturday and not very busy (but probably just a matter of time)"}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl is the best place for Hainan-style Chicken over Rice in Vegas - well there aren't a whole lot of choices that specialize in it but still they're good here. The ginger sauce is totally on point here and the chicken is juicy and tender. While the chicken itself is mild in flavor, that is mostly due to the nature of the dish. I've also had one of their sandwiches, which was unique and tasty (Tonkatsu sandwich). At around 10 or so before tax and tip, it can be a little pricey for what it is considering there are places in Southern California that charge about 7 dollars for the same dish, though I'm sure the chicken at Flock & Fowl is sourced for higher quality.  I have to knock off a star for the price and also the fact that this is one of those restaurants without a public bathroom. To me, that's unacceptable for restaurants.  It's also worth mentioning their hours - it's truly a lunch place only being open from 10:30am to 3:30pm."}
{"text":"I was able to stowaway your n my 'guardians's' car and they went to  this Flock and Fowl place. I guess they're known for their Haines chicken and let me tell you it lived up to the hype. Poached anything sounds so boring but this had such a subtle flavor that is just meowy!!  My other 'guardian had Hot Flock Sando. I snuck a large bite while she wasn't looking and quite yummy!!"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked chicken!  Yes, add sausage to the rice. Sauces...so good! Wings are yummy. Sambal wings were super spicy, but I couldn't stop taking another bite.  What!? No msg in all the food? Wow  Homemade lemon tea, one can taste the care in its making.  Ambience is unassuming, and not pretentious.  Will be back VERY soon."}
{"text":"new gem, impressive for vegas.  hainan poached chicken done quite well.  excellent flavor, free range chicken, good dipping sauces (ginger one could be a little stronger), but rice flavorful = key, lots of ginger. no msg. broth 25c. the fried chicken baos with buttermilk chicken also excellent, juicy some caramelized sauce with perfect balance of sprouts and shredded kale.  the chicken wings, thai version, crispy with glaze, also sweet and savory with the right amount of fish sauce."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go to in Vegas for chicken rice.  At the downtown location, there are 2 dishes that are my new favorites - the Laksa and the fried chicken wings!  The Laksa is a flavorful noodle soup dish.  It's rich and so comforting with the coconut curry soup base.  The chicken wings are juicy with a light, crispy batter.  You can't go wrong with any of the sauce/spice choices for the wings. It just depends on your mood.   Also depending on my mood, I'll either get the Hainan chicken or the roast hen.  For the Hainan chicken I like to add the perfect egg and a side of the chicken broth.  So good!"}
{"text":"Update... Back again and once again happy as can be. Got the tenders with rice this time and it was fantastic! Jenny is friendly as always and remembers her customers by name. Today was busy there and she was running around, people had to wait for a minute...the reason I'm mentioning this is because I want you yelpers to understand it's their soft opening, and they don't have a full staff yet...SO BE PATIENT! It's really not a long wait, but be understanding that local businesses need a bit of time to get everything straightened out. They are clearly competent restaurant owners and I have zero doubt that the wait won't be an issue in the future. Believe me, try the food..if you know and want good Chinese food this is your new favorite spot.  -------------------------------------------------------  Flock and Fowl is own and ran by the owners of Fat Choy, which was featured on the Food Network. I came in during their soft opening and Jenny was super nice, and to top it off the Hainan Chicken was simply amazing. It reminds me of grandma's cooking from Taiwan! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Hainan chicken rice in Vegas!! The restaurant is tiny with artistic decorations. The location is a bit hard to find, but it's worth the driving.  I got their traditional Hainanese chicken rice (poached). The chicken is a combination of black and white meat. If you want to make it all black/white, it's 2 dollars extra. The meat is juicy and tender, sauces are flavorful, and the rice is cooked to a perfect texture. Service is quick and friendly. Since I am a big fan of Hainan chicken rice, I personally think that Flock & Fowl is definitely up to the LA hainan chicken standard."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We ordered the deviled eggs, kaya toast, egg drop soup, and the poached hainan chicken with sausage and the one hour egg (aka sous vide egg).   From worst to best, the deviled eggs were just ok. I liked the texture contrast with the fried outer coating, toasted puffs and fried shallots. The flavor was just okay, however and nothing I would crave again.  The kaya toast was very good with just the right balance of sweet and salty. The brioche toast was interesting but I missed the crispy contrast of a more toasted bread.  I REALLY enjoyed their egg drop soup. The broth had a complex flavor and I liked the mushroom in it.  Of course the star was the hainan chicken. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the rice had a ton of flavor. It comes with 3 dipping sauces, a ginger scallion, chili sauce, and soy sauce. The soy sauce was too salty and the green sauce had an after taste which I did not like. I liked their chili sauce but not enough to buy it (they sell it separately). The egg was awesome and added a silky texture to the rice.  Also, I should note their excellent tea selection (I recommend their smoky black tea) and a great cocktail selection (although I just had their yuzu beer - which was refreshing).  Definitely recommend it if you're in the arts district and I also disagree that it's not child friendly. We saw several kids in there and our kids were just fine in there."}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl is a nice restaurant which I will be revisiting soon. Chef Sheridan Su has a gem with his creation of Flock & Fowl and this second location located at the Ogden brings with it an enjoyable experience.  At first it felt similar to the previous restaurant which was at the location, but I'm sure with time they will make it their own. The menu was printed with some light colored ink which made reading it interesting, but nonetheless doable. I will say that the service was quick as I was sat and my drink order was in moments after entering the door.  My group got the chicken wings (half salt & pepper, half honey butter), Son in Law \"Deviled Eggs\", Edamame, and the Downtown Farmer's Salad to share. All of it was good, but the salt & pepper chicken wings and the salad were my favorite.  For my entree I decided to get the Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice with an organic fried egg and daily vegetables. The poached chicken was very good with both the house made soy sauce and chile. I'm not typically a big fan of cold chicken, but to my delight it went very well with what it is plated around.  Overall I felt the service was great and the customer experience was one I'd tell my friends about."}
{"text":"I can start with how hard to find a parking space and took us 31 minutes to get our food... we order 2 no one with extra egg and Chinese sausage. The taste is different than the old place everything so salty and the the rice is not as good as the original. Sadly I won't come back to this place... i used to come to visit every time im in vegas"}
{"text":"The best Hainan Chicken rice nothing compare than Savoy in LA the rice very tasty and the chicken very tender... Im glad to stop by taste the real food"}
{"text":"Vegetarian option available! I come during the week day lunch rush. Jenny is absolutely awesome there along with the rest of the crew! They're all very genuine and remember you from previous visit. It's very hole in the wall and has minimum seating so be sure to get there at 12pm sharp for lunch! Otherwise wait till 1pm. I don't eat meat however i very much love the salad with no chicken and i order it extra large so it comes on big huge plate. I love it's sort of a \"garbage salad\" meaning it just has a handful of a million different things in there. They often change a little based on what they have on hand but can have anything from quinoa, fresh herbs, berrys, nuts, seeds, grape fruit, dried fruits, legumes. It's fantastic! The chrysanthemum tea is my fave!"}
{"text":"Hipster style hainan chicken, alongside its sister roasted and fried chicken. Came here during my most recent vegas trip and was pleasantly surprised to find this restaurant away from the strip. Overall the food was pretty good, but I have to say service was a bit off. They definitely need to work out the table and seating service a bit better.   Like all \"new\" interpretation of old dishes, it's hard to get right with all the flavor points on par. Personally, I still favor Big Wong more traditional version of the dish. Nonetheless, I did appreciate that they had a variety of ways to cooks and flavor the chicken here. The roasted chicken with salad was delicious and the S.o ordered the fried chicken rice plate and couldn't be happier. The only miss was probably the chicken broth which I found a bit bland and in all honesty, lacking in chicken Essenes and flavor. It as a bit watered down for me.   Would I make the trip out again if I was visiting Vegas? Probably not. However, if I was a local looking for a healthy option for lunch, I'll definitely make a trip."}
{"text":"I ordered our food for take out.  When I arrived it was waiting, Jenny finished up with two customers in front of me and then took care of me.  Even having to drive back home, the food was hot. We ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and the Caramel Thai Chicken Wings and loved both.  I'm still thinking about those wings.....  The hours are limited; but it's understandable given that the owner works in the restaurant.  I'll be visiting again for lunch take out because it is so close to my office.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Lack of options. Only open til 3:30pm.  LIKE  Hainan chicken rice. Chicken was free range. Side option of organic egg. Chrysanthemum tea. Hospitable employees. Sauces made in-house.  LOVE  Fried chicken bao. Natural and fresh ingredients. What they do have on the menu, they do extremely well."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Excellent service. The food is Asian but with a modern taste. A good representation of good outside of the box food."}
{"text":"Rate: 4.5  Customer Service: Excellent! Very welcoming! Fast. Jenny(owner) knows how to run her business!  Atmosphere: cozy & chill (smaller building).  Food: Roasted spring Chicken w/ rice  and broth. MUST TRY  BAO (not sure what it is...just know my friend always gets it and loves it)  Wings(Thai caramel): sweet n crisp!"}
{"text":"I came in with high hopes! Yelp, you have let me down. The cocktails and bartender were great, the food was adequate at best.  Downtown Las Vegas isn't the first thought for where to find top notch restaurants in Las Vegas, but there are a few hidden gems. Yelp suggested Flock & Fowl, I decided based on reviews it was worth a shot.   We ordered the Kaya toast, tingling peanuts, deviled eggs, chicken rice, and Laksa.  Tingling peanuts: these are great, no complaints.  Kaya toast: egg was slightly under cooked, the soy sauce balanced out the sweetness nicely. It lacked something, couldn't put my finger on it.  Deviled eggs: these are awful. the textures combined ... not good. There's a hard to chew fried skin on the outside of the egg... meh. It was a boiled egg cut in half with some stuff sprinkled on it. This shouldn't be called a deviled egg. Honestly the worst thing we had.   Chicken rice: this was tasty, I don't really understand the choice for the chicken and the rice to be room temperature, but that didn't take much from the dish. The egg served with it was nice and the chicken broth honestly ended up being the highlight.   Laksa: not enough salt and not enough acid. I'd call this dish mediocre at best. It was acceptable but just nothing special about it.  Overall this was a pretty disappointing experience, I probably won't return here. The service was prompt and friendly but the food.. so bland."}
{"text":"If you like Savoy in LA, than you'll probably enjoy this place.  Place is small, so there would be a wait. Order first and wait to be seated.  Hours are short, they close at 3:30. Of course get the Hainan Chicken Rice, I did mention Savoy.  Make sure you add a broth as well, nothing like some steamy hot chicken broth to clean the systems.  The wings not a big fan of, but I'm never a fan of sweet wings.  Chicken tender bao is spot on, nice fried tender strip along with a bao (peking duck style). Must have!!  If you like tea, they have some special brew, but I recommend getting a pot to share.   They do serve everything in paper plates, I guess they are ahead of the minimum wage game.   Happy poaching"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!  When I saw the menu I was a bit hesitant since there didn't seem to be a lot of options and I thought the plates would be small but no ...the small plates were shareable and the meal in itself was delicious.  The drinks were strong and delicious given that we tried a few different cocktails and the price was just right.    The restaurant itself was open and cozy and where we were seated we could see into the semi open kitchen.  We had gone in on a rainy day so there was not a lot of dinner traffic so our server had time and was very attentive - making sure he offered a drink as we got to the last sip, replenishing water and just appearing like a magician.    For the food we tried a few things at the table but I shared the Flock Frites ..yummy!  They were crispy and soft and just delicious.  The chicken wings were next and they were perfectly done and delicious.  One of my absolute favorites was the Kaya Toast and we did add foie gras to that.  The foie was a healthy portion and we gobbled up that toast as soon as it hit the table.  We finished our appetizers off with the son in law deviled eggs.  I loved this as much as I enjoyed the toast because why not a fried deviled egg with peanut sauce.    For my main I really wanted the sea bass but they had sold all that out during their lunch rush so I settled for the signature hainanese chicken with a side of the chicken bone broth and root vegetables.  I'd say the bone broth was one of my favorite items on the plate and I could have been satisfied with a full bowl of that and some of the toast.  The chicken was good and nothing to complain about but I was still thinking of the bass.  The root vegetable I ate but I'm not generally a fan of some of the vegetables so I'd say in my entire meal that's the only thing I didn't like because of my own personal preferences.  Try this place out and definitely get the toast and the broth!"}
{"text":"Hainan Chicken Rice is the dish to get. It takes me back to eating my Dad's version he used to make. I love the choice of complementary sauces/condiments - finely minced garlic/onion, soy sauce, and a spicy orange sauce. So each piece you take a bite of, you can pare with a different flavor. The Indo Fried Rice was also very good and tasty with good flavor. For me, the Fried Chicken Bao was on the dry side, we ordered a couple to try, but could've done without. The Hainan Chicken Rice and Indo Fried Rice are worth coming for. Will be back again to try some of the other dishes. Service was also excellent. We were a party of 6, and they did the best to keep a look out on who was wrapping up and try to group us together, and it worked out that we were able to combine a few tables and sit as a group. Tip: Seating is limited. So, there may be a wait. You can also order to-go."}
{"text":"Okay one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for quality and value. They've gotta be doing something right if they only open for 5 hours a day and are closed on Sunday's  and Monday's.   The poached hainan chicken is to die for. And yes get the broth for an extra 99 cents. And get the egg for the extra 1.99. The chicken is soft, not greasy, and just melts in your mouth. The rice it comes with is just so perfect! Al dente and lightly flavored. My favorite part was mixing the left over rice in the broth and adding a few of the sauces.   Baos: they make Em fresh and piping hot. I wish the sauce was a bit sweeter (like hoisin sauce) it was really salty and lacked any umami flavor. They also use organic sprouts and the buns are soft and fluffy  Lastly, get the mango saffron sago! Perfectly sweetened with just the right amount of sugar, yummy chia seeds and a good amount of fruit.  I can't wait to come back. Also, the owners are taiwanese!! So of course I had to come support them."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Singaporean food and I can tell you it will not be last! One of the waitresses greater us at the door and explained the full menu to us. I decided to go with the poached chicken while the two other people in my group went with the roasted chicken salad and the chicken noodle soup special respectively. The presentation of all three plates was wonderful... almost as wonderful as the taste! My poached chicken was excellent and fell right off of the skin.  The three homemade sauces: Ginger, hot/spicy and soy sauce were amazing. If I ever come back to Las Vegas I definitely will be stopping here again! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This amazing local secret has some of the BEST food off the strip! This place is FLOCKING amazing! I've had the opportunity to try everything and I have to say, even though they have a small menu, it doesn't disappoint. The caramel wings are heaven and the fried chicken bao bun is a personal favorite. They make their dipping sauces fresh. The only drawback to this place is that it's only open during the day and seating is extremely LIMITED."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and has a very unique and delicious taste! I come here as often as I can for lunch. Their salad is my favorite ! The service is excellent! Be aware though, it is a small place and can get crowded for lunch. I'll be there today :)"}
{"text":"Opening night and the Flock & Fowl did not disappoint.  Great cocktails followed by the Angry Wings.  They were not too sweat and not too hot.  They were absolutely perfect!  Another cocktail followed by the Laksa.  All I can say is amazing!  By far the BEST curry I have ever had!   The chicken was so tender and flavorful.  The noodles were perfect and the prawn was the size of a small child.  I really hope the Laksa stays on the menu as a regular item because I will order it every time.  Amazing job to the entire staff on the great Grand Opening!  Job well done."}
{"text":"The dishes were subpar. I ordered butter milk chicken. Paul came over and asked if I like the food. I told him that the chicken was ok. It wasn't spectacular and it wasn't bad. It is slightly below standard as it has no seasoning. Paul then suggested swooping it out with their Hainan chicken.  The Hainan came out to be below standard as well. The chicken was gummy and tasteless. It seems like they took a chicken and boiled it in water. I have had better hainan chicken rice in Chinatown.  Paul is great though. He comped the dish and is very nice about it.  I won't come back for the food but their service is great. Paul is an asset to the business.  Jenny, in response to your comment, I had a bite and I couldn't eat it. It's a different case if I ate the whole two dishes and asked to be comped. 98% of the food is still the in the plate. So why would I pay for something that I couldn't eat? Don't send your waiter around and asked to switch out dishes or comp dishes if you don't believe in customer service or doing it.   The rating is just for food. If you have bad food and great customer service, at the end of the day, customers still won't come back. Just FYI."}
{"text":"James beard winner worthy for Las Vegas 2018. The BEST customer service experience and the food was delicious! 5 stars and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Tip Update:  More tables have been added, and you can even sit outside if you like.  I guess I am now a Vegas regular as this is one of the first places that I add to my itinerary and come to mind when I'm planning my Las Vegas jaunts.  Why not: the owner remember me and knows my name (yes, remembered my name and I don't live anywhere near Vegas and have only visited 2 or 3 times), ALL menu items are great (especially the poached Hainan Chicken Rice), and the service is great!  Chicken, thus the \"fowl\" is the star of this restaurant.  However, it is also accompanied by fresh and interestingly paired side items and herbs.  This is also the only place that I indulge in iced coffee.  It's great.  I usually get a double shot just so that I have a larger portion.  Now, on to the burger at Fat Choy..."}
{"text":"Just had the #1, poached chicken w/ rice and added the Chinese sausage. The flavor of the sausage with the the spicy sauce is amazingly good. The poached chicken is also perfect and delicious. I don't even like poached chicken but wanted to make my way down menu so I was shocked I liked it so much. I'm not sure you can get a better lunch for around 10 bucks anywhere. Truly great food"}
{"text":"So this is just my totally horrible experience. Maybe this was a fluke but it was so frustrating that I have to write this review.   Ok, the place is very small inside so we had to wait for others to be done before we could be seated. The guy said oh it goes by fast. They have your name on the list, ok well then they decided to seat the guy that ordered after us. Then, after we were already waiting for 20 minutes, a large group of 7 walked in. They then also seated the large group before us and pushed together three small tables.   By the time we finally got to sit down, they have served the guy after us, a to go order, and almost all of the seven people sitting in the large group. Oh also my husband ordered a Vietnamese coffee that he didn't get because they said they were brewing more. Well, when it was done they gave three other people who ordered after us theirs first.   So my food came out first, husband was still waiting and now pretty much everyone that came after us has food. I ask what is going on and they tell me they are short. Ok, but why does everyone else have their food but us? Even another family of four after the party of seven was getting their food before my husband had his. What.   We were there for an hour from the time of order to getting food finally.   The food was ok. Nothing special that was like ohhh this is so worth the wait! Nope, plus the portion was tiny.   I can see where people like this place and the dishes look good and interesting and what we had was good but this experience was just horrible and I regret going there. I've never been skipped over that much at any place ever and had that many people that ordered after me get food before I got anything at all. It wasn't like we ordered anything special or different from what the others got either. I didn't understand and it was super frustrating. It wasn't a matter of an extra 15 minutes either. This was a whole hour!   I'm not from around here so I won't have the chance to give it another shot but after this I don't think I would risk wasting another hour of my time to be skipped over again."}
{"text":"I'm really sad to write this but I was very disappointed with the food and service at flock and fowl. My friend and I were excited to come try out this restaurant, the menu looked great. We ordered and waited, and waited and waited and waited. Almost an hour had gone by and we hadn't even gotten our food. The table who sat after us with 3 more people had food before us. I didn't understand because it was a quiet and empty Sunday evening at the restaurant.   I looked up and saw my food sitting waiting to be served for about 20 min. I guess they were waiting for my friends dish to be ready so they could bring it out at the same time. But when his dish was finally ready and they brought our food out, it was stone cold. I've never ever had to return something for being cold before. I called the waitress over and before I even opened my mouth to tell her if she could return because it was cold she already knew why, she said \"cold? Yea they don't have their timing down.\" If she knew why didn't she ask them to make it again before serving me cold food? By the time I got my food back my friend was done with his and I was light headed from being so hungry. I was ready to eat just about anything that was put in front of me. So I got my food and thank goodness it was actually hot but the downside was that it was sooooooo salty I could barely swallow. I'm not picky at all but it really felt like they way over salted it, maybe because they were in a rush from having to redo my dish? Who knows.  Anyways that was my experience at flock and fowl and I was so bummed out about it and still very hungry that I went down the street to get pizza from evil pie."}
{"text":"Six 2- chair tables. Utterly plain.  Ambience devoid of frills. Utterly unpretentious.    Five dishes.   Utterly simple.  Hainan Chicken Rice Utterly genuine.    Quality food.   Utterly affordable.   Read an article on Eater so I drove to the strip on Wednesday 16 September.  The lady who helped me and  got my order was also working behind the register, taking \"to go\" orders, serving food, cleaning up tables, greeting people coming in, asking seated customers how their food was, thanking people who were leaving.  She was like a mini-dynamo. She had no change for my $20 dollar bill so she stepped out and went to her car (a red jag!) to get some change.    Then I realized she's Chef Wong!  Super nice lady.  She was apologetic for the wait and promised things would improve and get better as they just opened up.    Chef Jenny, there's absolutely no need to apologize.  Absolutely no reason to.  Everything is fine.   As a matter of fact, everything is beyond fine. . .as is . . .as they are!"}
{"text":"Staff was overly friendly, could tell they really take ownership in their place!  Walked is through the menu, all of their recommendations was spot on.  I had the 1/2 roasted chicken (it's actually Cornish hen) with salad.  Everything was fresh, tasty, and in season!!   I would definitely recommend and will absolutely be going back!  Only complaint would be that they close at 3:30pm and not open later"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Small menu but they do it well.  Ordered the hainanese chicken with broth and 1 hour egg, and the laksa.  Both were excellent.  The chicken was so moist and delicately flavored and had that perfect slippery unctuous chicken texture.  Broth was surprisingly not too salty (most other  places have salty broth) but tasted like really good chicken broth.  Laksa has intense curry flavor and didn't taste like the usual heavy coconut broth, but it was a pleasantly different take that I enjoyed more than expected.  Perfect portions; not too big and left you just satiated enough to be ready for dessert.  We had the warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream; a bit too sweet for my palate and would have liked it a little more cooked, but if you like the super ooey-gooey freshly baked chocolate chip cookie from the oven, this may suit you.   Excellent meal that surprised me in a good way, even with being prepared by the great reviews."}
{"text":"I lurve Hainanese chicken rice. To me, it's kinda like pizza...there's no such thing as bad chicken rice. While that may be true, I have not found good chicken rice in all my years of being in the US...till now.   If you can't get to Malaysia or Singapore anytime soon, then come to Flock & Fowl. This is Hainan chicken rice.   If you have a skeptical SO who does not believe in the magic of \"just boiled chicken and rice\", bring him/her to Flock & Fowl. The dish will speak for itself.   Everything was done right - from how the chicken was poached, to the jelly under the smooth slippery skin, to the evenly chopped pieces of chicken, to the flavorful oily rice, to the chili and soy sauce condiments that tasted like they were straight from a hawker stall or kopitiam in SEA.  The restaurant itself was small and cute, and service was wonderful, and the other items on the menu looked delicious as they were being delivered to other tables. The Vietnamese iced coffee was yummy too (not too sweet) and the Indonesian fried rice that was on special was tasty as well. The only way you can possibly go wrong here is by coming by too late in the day - they do sell out."}
{"text":"As per usual perfect food and perfect service. If you haven't been to this place in Vegas, you are missing out.  My personal tip - chicken bao, honey sriracha wings (they are not too spicy, and they are deliciously crispy and perfect), and a Vietnamese coffee.  You can never go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This place was a good find. We got a lot of little plates to share and it was good food and a laid back vibe. Their fried chicken is crunchy and not over cooked. The portions are reasonable for the price. It was all very tasty, we cleaned all the plates. I would recommend this spot. Also close to the 15, so it's easy to come here and have lunch if you're driving through. Parking is easy."}
{"text":"Thank you to Terri and Mel for this recommendation!    Special thanks to Terri who checked into this cool restaurant today and reminded me to finish this review...  Looking for dinner after a show in Las Vegas can be stressful. Luckily, we got a list of food places to go to from our friends, Mel and Terri!  Flock and Fowl is located in Downtown Las Vegas.  We got free street parking right in the front because it was so late - about 10pm.  The crowd had already come and gone, so we were seated immediately.   Imortant Tip: get the Son-in-law eggs!  Even though it had a small dollop of spicy sauce on the top, the lightly breaded egg was perfectly prepared to encompass a mouthful of brilliant textures!  Delicious!  I went to the kitchen prep area to read my menu  because the light was better.  The chef asked if I needed help and recommended the Bacon Cheeseburger... so I got it... nom nom!  The handmade, thick, patty was very filling and flavorful!  Before we left, Chef stopped by our table and chatted with us - nice touch!  Dear Daniel had their specialty... Hainan Chicken.  He enjoyed it!  Minky and I got a taste and agreed that the chicken was tender and moist.  The broth added good flavor to it!   If you're looking for a new place to dine in Downtown Las Vegas, check this place out!  The ambiance is dark and classy.  The service is helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken wings!  The Thai Caramel and the spicier one was out of this world!  Really enjoyed the chicken in rice though they were out of the poached chicken that day so we did crispy.  Ordered the green tea milk and very fragrant.    Great service and the owners are very personable.    Will be back when in town!"}
{"text":"The chicken tastes like what I imagine when it's slaughtered the morning of. And the micro greens tasted freshly picked.  My husband ate the wings like he was teaching them a lesson.  Rice was delicious and their chicken broth and chicken skins are for sale. Wow!!! Had chrysanthemum hot tea which really complemented the meal. The sauces are all fresh. Efficient service and wait staff really cared about their customers. And thru seemed proud to work there. Thank you Amber and Liz!!!"}
{"text":"Got the #1 and #2 - both were excellent but we enjoyed the traditional #1 a bit more. The iced Vietnamese coffee was great, so good that after our meal we got another to go. Service was prompt and pleasant.   Great chicken, great coffee, and great service!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the staff is super friendly.  The sauces are made from scratch and combined, makes wonderful flavors.  Another plus is the organic chicken. What a difference."}
{"text":"As much as I love Flock & Fowl and tout it as the best place in Las Vegas to get Hainan chicken rice, during my last couple of visits, the quality and service has dropped off quite a bit. Located near the north end of The Strip, it borders the abandoned Rock in Rio festival grounds, the strip clubs, and the new Lucky Dragon casino. It's not the most ideal spot, but it does play as the perfect hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The space itself is pretty small and only fits roughly 20 seats. When they first opened, they used to take orders at the tables, but now they have transitioned to pay and sit (although when it gets busy, you can put your name down on a waitlist).   The menu is kept simple, which is a good thing. The specialty is Hainanese chicken rice prepared three different ways. The #1 (the best and only way) is the classically poached, quarter free-range chicken. Everything is deboned and cooked to perfection. It parallels the quality of the chicken you would get from Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra, CA. The other options are the #2 buttermilk fried chicken tenders and the #3 roasted spring chicken. All plates are beautifully plated with house ginger scallion, chili, or soy sauce with chicken rice, marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens. Add-on sides include a 63 degree egg, Chinese sausage, buttermilk fried chicken skin, or chicken broth. The other well-known menu item is the fried chicken bao. It's basically a piece of the buttermilk fried chicken tender with a kale pea sprout sesame slaw wrapped in a steamed bun. Although usually a favorite, I found the chicken to be very dry and lackluster during my most recent visit.  The service is really hit or miss here. I've found the servers to get very flustered when it gets packed and things are amiss from our order including long wait times. The other annoying thing are the odd hours of 10:30 am to 3:30 pm making for a very limited lunch service. When it does get busy, the line goes out the door, which makes for a very uncomfortable wait when it's in the middle of the sweltering summer heat. All in all, when I'm craving chicken, I come here. Also check out their fresh, house made lemon tea and Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is so good!!  Sheridan and Jenny do it again....combine intoxicating flavor and the freshest ingredients to create some of the best food available in Las Vegas!  They did it at Fat Choy, and they've done it here.  I had the chicken wings which were off-the-chart delicious. Next time I'll have the Hainan Chicken. Can't wait!  It's a tiny place, and people have caught on, so get there before 12:00 or after 2:00, but just get there!   Lunch only."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken ever. The wings are amazing and the frites are super good. Get the #1 with the fried egg and Chinese sausage and go nuts."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy, and high quality food, simple menu, great service. It's a gem of a restaurant so close to the strip."}
{"text":"Great service great prices great owners who care and love what they are doing .you can truly taste the passion in there food .keep up the great work looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious food with good portions. Definitely recommend the chicken sandwich its juicy and full of flavor. The atmosphere is good and our waitor was amazing and super helpful. Ask for Gino as a waitor and youll have no regrets!! 100% recomment if you're nearby"}
{"text":"Wherever I go, if there's hainanese chicken on the menu, I'm ordering it. I heard good things about Flock & Fowl, so I was excited to visit during my NYE vacation to Vegas.   The hainanese chicken was good. I like that the chicken isn't \"hard poached\", they get it just a wee bit under so the chicken is juicier. It comes with three sauces, a chili sambal, soy sauce and a green onion ginger sauce that's commonly served with cold ginger chicken. The dish comes with two sides - I picked Chinese sausage (lup cheong, a slightly sweet, dried sausage that has bits of fat in it) and chicken broth. The broth was too salty and it hadn't been properly skimmed. Next time, I'll go for the 1 hr egg. Oh, but the rice that was served with the hainanese chicken was delicious!!! I would say it was the star of the plate! It's one of the best chicken rice I've had!  If you aren't blessed with an Asian cooking mama, Flock & Fowl is your best bet. Vegas is lucky to have a restaurant that serves this simple dish well.   The flock frites were some of the best curly fries I've had, and I've lived decades eating curly fries. That fry sauce served with it is addictive.   The service, from the hostess to the waiter, were welcoming, friendly and kind. They made the experience all the more enjoyable. The restaurant itself is nice, decked out with sleek black walls.   This location is their second and it's in the heart of DTLV (Downtown Las Vegas), a convenient walking distance from Container Park. It's at the ground level of The Ogden, a luxury condo."}
{"text":"So this review is a little bit lengthy because it is both a review of the restaurant and a review of the owner.  I've grown up eating Hainan chicken rice. I'm from LA and literally spent my teenage years living off Savoy Hainan chicken rice. It's one of my favorite things to eat. I've been to the most well known places and some hole in the walls all over the world. So obviously, this is a comparison to all my other experiences.  3 stars for the food. Have come in a few times and sometimes the chicken and rice is great and sometimes it's dry. When it's great, it's 4 stars. The chicken and the rice do not have as fragrant a taste as other places I like, but the chicken can be very tender sometimes. (I'll say the same thing about the buttermilk fried chicken- tender but not flavorful). When it's not good, it's just...dry and tasteless and tough and then you have to grin and bear it because you just paid $10 for a 1/4 chicken and a little bit of rice.   Which leads to a minor second point. It's not cheap. I don't eat a lot, but just getting the Hainan chicken rice is not particularly satisfying. It doesn't feel like I'm getting a good deal for my small lunch that will put me $10+ after all is said and done.  OK. Moving on. The place is small and not super comfortable. Which leads to a third point. I have no idea what kind of business model this place has. The owner keeps saying she's trying to change the perception of Chinese food/chicken rice and justify a higher price point. Well, opening up a shack in a kindof crummy end of the strip with no toilet will not do that. The inside is kindof cute. But it's weird because...again, it is cute but inside a small joint in a crummy area at the end of the strip with no toilet. She mentions take out business being a big part of her business. At which point I want to know why she doesn't just run a straight up take out restaurant and charge a couple bucks less? I don't know if she wants to run a nice restaurant or a take out restaurant and I don't think she knows either. I'm not saying you can't do both, but I'm saying you have to have a point of view and she doesn't. $10 for a take out meal that is literally no frills chicken and rice feels like I should just go to Chick Fil A. Also, I think this place should realize that setting, ambiance, and service actually play a big role in why people spend the money they spend. It's not just the food. $15- $20 at an Italian restaurant tends to get you some bread, a nice place to sit, nice wait staff. $10 at a Chinese restaurant tends to get you a table and some tea thrown at you. I'm Chinese. I appreciate my people's efficiency. But I'm just saying, the extra $$ goes into a lot of things outside food.  And all this leads to the owner. I hope some of you have read her yelp responses and realize she is not a...pleasant person. She doesn't smile. And before you accuse me of demanding women to smile, I don't. I'm a woman and I just like it when SERVICE PEOPLE smile at me. Even just to welcome me in. Because they are in the SERVICE industry. Honestly, I just assumed she was a really serious person because we sometimes would make jokes with her and she would just stare at us like we were wasting her time. But then I read her yelp responses and it's bananas. Because I realized she actually isn't just serious, she's obnoxiously defensive. Someone says they can make better chicken rice at home and she replies \"let me know when you open up your own restaurant then.\" Who says that!? Oh, I guess she does. I mean, the point of eating out is so you DON'T have to do things yourself. This is how our actual economy works. You provide a service at a price we think is less than the cost of our time. If that doesn't happen, we feel like we've been had! I bet if I complained about the quality of my J Crew shirt, she'd tell me to go buy some sheep and a loom to make my own shirt. And someone complains about price v. portion size and she says everyone else charges the same or more. Which is really just a lack of understanding on economic principles. You were judged, by the market, to have a subpar product compared to your competition. Your response is not \"everyone else does it\" when your everyone else offers something more - bigger portions, better quality, or you know, a smile. Your response doesn't actually have to be anything. But it's certainly not that.   If the recent United incident has taught any business anything it's that the customer is always right but this owner seems intent on following Oscar Munoz's initial response and stubbornly refuse to acknowledge any criticism.   And finally, I just want to be petty and point out that she claims to be one of the FEW Hainan chicken rice places in AMERICA. I've been to many many places across America. This place can be good, but it's nowhere near the best and it's certainly not one of the few."}
{"text":"Best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Nevada. Hands Down! Trust me, I tried it all here in Vegas!  I used to eat chicken rice everyday in singapore since I was 7 yrs old. I tried hainanese chicken rice everywhere I go.. This restaurant nailed it. Chicken was perfectly cooked, rice was seasoned and cooked the right way, they offer the sauces that goes with it and it also comes with the soup. I'll definetely come here often.. I hope they open at night too so I can order my food here because it is close to where I work. Oh well. You guys have to try it!"}
{"text":"This place is so very overrated!  Ten bucks for a scoop of rice and less than half a hainan chicken breast.   I expected a very tasty rice with a nice portion of chicken.  I've made this recipe at home and my version is much much better imo.  For $10, I could make a whole chicken and pot of rice.   Probably one of the least amounts of food I've had for the money."}
{"text":"Two of us came here for brunch this past Saturday.  This was my second visit to this location and it was a great dining experience.  We ordered the following dishes with their menu descriptions:  Kaya toast--SE Asian coconut egg jam, brioche, fried egg, house sweet soy Flock frites--curly fries, parmesan, Flock Sauce, herbs Quinoa salad with fried cauliflower (added Chinese sausage)--almonds, crispy tofu, sesame vinaigrette Fried chicken bao--steamed bun slider with chicken Buttermilk fried chicken Benedict--poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce Cast iron chocolate chip cookie--freshly baked, vanilla ice cream, miso caramel sauce  If you go here for brunch, you must try the fried chicken Benedict.  Perfectly cooked poached eggs with excellent Hollandaise.  Another complete winner is the Flock frites.  The sauce is very good and the fries are addictive.  Take a friend or two with you because the serving is very large.    The sesame vinaigrette on the quinoa salad was perfect.  The light flavoring allowed the flavors of the quinoa, tofu, and sausage to shine.  For dessert, the cast iron chocolate chip cookie is a great choice.  The pan was almost clean when we were done!  The only downside can be parking.  There is plenty there but you have to pay unless you park away and walk.  That's not the fault of Flock & Fowl but the city getting parking revenue from the growing DTLV scene."}
{"text":"I have been to Chef Sheridan Su's Fat Choy restaurant in the Eureka Casino and I was intrigued when I learned that he opened a new place with a very limited menu of Hainan chicken and four other items.  Six of us decided to meet for lunch yesterday and it would give me the chance to try the Hainan chicken about which I've read so much.  We were served everything on the menu.  As it only contains 5 things plus a few à la carte items, everything was enough and very good.  We started with fried chicken bao with kale pea sprout slaw.  The chicken was excellent, breaded just right, and with the slaw and the soft bao, it made one great sandwich.  Next came two orders of chicken wings--one of Thai caramel and one called Mystery wings which are Szechuan style wings.  I had one of each.  I liked the Szechuan wings better but I'm not a chicken wing fan.  Generally when I order wings, I get boneless wings which aren't wings at all.  It's the messy fingers syndrome I don't like.  Then we were served a Flock & Fowl salad with Cornish game hen pieces.  I had some salad but I didn't try the hen.    Last, we were brought two dishes--one with the Hainan poached chicken for which this place has become known and one with fried chicken tenders and rice.  Both dishes come with three sauces, ginger scallion, house made chile, and house made soy.  Both dishes come with rice and marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens.  The Hainan chicken comes with a cup of broth.  These dishes are excellent!!  The Hainan chicken is moist and delightfully boneless and the dipping sauces add to the taste of the chicken.  The tenders are excellent!  This is a must return to place.  The bao, the tenders, and the Hainan chicken are all worthy of having again!    A couple of tips:  this is a lunch only restaurant open from 10:30-3:30.  It's a small place seating just 16 people so you may have a wait.  This is in a small strip mall on West Sahara near the freeway on the north side of Sahara.    Chef Su and Jenny Wong are most gracious people and you'll enjoy your stop here!"}
{"text":"Bwok, if you like the chicken and rice lifestyle this is your one stop shop. The chicken is perfection"}
{"text":"Some great and interesting dishes served by very friendly staff, tucked away in a quiet pocket just off of the Fremont experience. Highly recommend the kaya toast! Always nice to see the management out talk to the customers too!"}
{"text":"Flocking A. One of the best places to not miss in Vegas! Seriously this place can compete with the big players. And on top of that the staff is awesome. Even the vegetarian can find enough to amuse their palette. Don't worry about if the chicken or egg came first - just come check them out."}
{"text":"Hip spot downtown. Meter parking right out front is easy.    This joint is more casual than I anticipated. Plastic plates, table was dirty when we sat, they brought place settings later etc. Our server was knowledgeable and nice.   We had the kaya toast with foie gras. The flavors were great but our foie was drastically over cooked. Was a shame. We also had the Hainanese poached chicken. This was a \"meh\" for me. The beets/veggies on the side and bone broth were outstanding. The chicken and rice was nothing special at all. No flavor there. The sauces were delightful. The hot sauce was so delicious we bought a pint to bring home and have put it on everything since.   We had a scrumptious baked chocolate chip cookie with miso caramel and ice cream. Gooey and decadent.   My cocktail was pretty and nicely balanced.   We agreed we enjoyed the overall experience but don't see a need to run back downtown for it anytime soon. Alas, was bustling in there by 7:00!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with a couple of friends a few weeks ago, and loved this place! I honestly don't remember what I ate, as my friend ordered for me but I did have the sausage and it was delicious! All the food tasted great, but honestly what stuck out the most was their incredible service and care. Our server was so so sweet and made us feel very welcomed. We were hanging out with a friend who was visiting in town and I think they could tell, so even when they were closed they told us not to feel rushed and to just sit back and enjoy talking, which we did. It was awesome though, most places you feel awkwardly pushed out, but they made us feel welcomed to stay. Even when we were inside and it was already closed, a guy came by thinking it was still open and they still served him! Even as we left, the owner came out to personally introduce herself and invite us to come back! I just thought \"wow, that's how you seriously love your guests!\" Good job to them for really caring about their clientele."}
{"text":"I really like this place.   It's a bit cozy, few tables inside, thank goodness we got there before it got crowded.  The food is very good, service is great and friendly staff.  Ordered several dishes and we liked all of them.   Not sure about the names but they're all chicken lol.  My favorite was the chicken wings drumsticks.  So delicious!   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am a fan.  I love Fat Choy (although don't get there as often as I'd like), so when I saw Chef Su was opening a new joint, I figured it was a must go. But that was months (or even years) ago....the hours and the location were just not that convenient for me, so I FINALLY made it over to Flock & Fowl this week.  We got to try the signature poached chicken and rice, both flavors of wings, and the fried chicken bao (what fatties!). The bao was excellent, as expected. I enjoyed both flavors of wings, but really loved the caramel ones. Probably would have eaten more than a couple. The poached chicken is.....boiled chicken. I mean, they make it well, so that it's juicy and all, but I'm not sure how good poached chicken can get. The chicken does come with rice (very chicken-y tasting!), some condiments, and 3 dipping sauces. I enjoyed the soy-like sauce, and the mild sriracha-like sauce, but found the ginger sauce just bland and oily.  Prices are about $10 per plate, and the service was extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, I'll definitely return if I'm in the area, but considering the location and hours, I won't seek it out. I will recommend it for lunch to anybody staying or working in the area."}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl DTLV   How do I even think about giving Flock & Fowl DTLV less than 5 Stars?  First of all, Jenny Wong and Chef Su are the best.  Second, the Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice is awesome.  And third, this new location is open later and a lot more spacious.   I grew up eating Hainanese chicken and white rice.  I have also tried Hainanese Chicken at other establishments across the West Coast.  Bar none, Flock & Fowl is the best.  I love my pops aka Mel C Sr.  But sorry dad, Flock & Fowl's Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice is second to none. I think that the secret to this dish is the chicken fat rice.  Maybe it's the free-range chicken?  Or, is it the organic fried egg?  Actually, I don't know what the secret is, and it really doesn't matter at this point.  I'll continue to get this dish no matter what.  I prefer the Signature with the Chinese sausage and the perfectly round organic fried egg every single time.  I'll take the entire dish, scramble it together, and deMELish it.  Every bite is heaven.  This dish is perfection and if you have never tried it before, then you're missing out.  By the way, how the heck does Flock & Fowl always serve a perfectly round and photogenic fried egg every single time?  The rest of the menu is the same as the original location, but with a few creative and unique items added. Alcohol is also served at this location.  I am a huge fan of the original location, but will start going to this location more often.  The new location is a lot larger, is open at night (when the cravings hit), and is only 15 minutes from my house.  It's a no brainer.  Flock & Fowl DTLV will be seeing me A LOT.    My Recommendations... *Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice (ALWAYS get this) *Son-in-Law Deviled Eggs *Egg Drop Soup *Honey Butter Chicken Wings *Flock on Flock Chicken Sando.  I need to try the burger soon.  *Baked Chocolate Chip Cookie & Ice Cream w/Miso Caramel Drizzle (Dessert) *Kaya Toast (Dessert)  TIP:  Flock & Fowl DTLV is cash-less. Bring your card.  What's in your wallet?"}
{"text":"Food  Hainan Chicken Rice  Precaution: this is going to be a major hit or miss as the whole restaurant concept is to push this one dish as THE main dish. Everything else is just a supporting side dish.  Classic Hainan gingery green-oniony chicken oil noise presentation. A saltiness with the creaminess of lean chicken oil in the rice. A rice is a tad salty for my palate. Delicately subtle and balance. No fishiness. Texture is plummy. Perfect. Not easy to get a chicken this level of delicacy in the US.  All of the nose and palate sensations are enforced with the minced ginger green-onion chicken-oil condiment. Pickled cucumber and mustard green needs to give a sourness counterbalance instead of just saltiness. Chili sauce has a garlicky sweet note and soy sauce gives saltiness compliment as needed.  Tip: eat with all 3 condiments together.  Ordered with (Organic) over-easy egg and 1 hour egg. One hour egg is a poached-like steamed whole egg. A hint of salt and black pepper with a velvety texture. Beautiful!  4.5/5  Service  Casual and friendly. Alcohol service. Average/expected. 3.5/5.  Ambiance  Dim romantic setting. A trendy bistro setting. Expected except for (my pet peeve) dirty restroom. 3-/5.  Overall  The food still is special and kills it. Yes, it's worth its $14.99 price. 4.5/5."}
{"text":"All the FOODIES in Las Vegas definitely flock here.  It's worth the drive because you'll feel like it's off the beaten path getting there.  It's like Vegas meets SF good."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! :D First of all, my bf and I don't typically like hainan chicken (usually has this weird taste that I can't explain but know that i don't like) but felt the urge to order it because of all the great reviews and they were right! The chicken was soo tender and juicy and went SUPER well with that spicy house sauce. We were actually really excited to order the fried chicken baos (basically the main reason we came here) and boyyyyyyy am I glad we did! We really wanted to come back for another order of those baos but we had such little time :(  The chef seemed super nice as he came out a few times to greet his regulars and we were only there for an hour or less sooo he's a pretty popular guy I'd say.  RULES: Order first then sit, or wait to be seated. It is a small mom/pop restaurant so be patient for their awesome foood! We waited only a few minutes but found it surprising to be full at 2:30PM.  Definitely try the hainin chicken and those fried chicken baos .. my onyl regret is not trying the fried chicken entree :("}
{"text":"Perfect downtown addition. Owners who care and are delighted to be part of a vibrant community. Lip smacking crave-worthy dishes served up with heartwarming service with a smile. I'm all in. Just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Bring your flock down here. The food is definitely not \"fowl.\"  Flock & Fowl's downtown Las Vegas location is the newest venture by Chef Sheridan Su and Jenny Wong, the power couple behind such successful business ventures as Fat Choy and the original location of Flock & Fowl. They've taken over a relatively cavernous space at the Ogden which was formerly inhabited by the not-so-interesting Itsy Bitsy Ramen & Whisky.  Parking isn't great unless you pay for it, wait until 10pm and get lucky enough to find a free spot on the street, or leave your car far enough away while walking away your calories in advance. But when you do get here, you can post up at the bar on the lower \"floor\" or get seated upstairs in the main section. I would've much preferred a well-lit spot at the counter, but my friends and I sat by the window. At night. With that unfortunate dim lighting favored by so many restaurants.  Thankfully, the food was awesome enough that I didn't have to worry about not seeing it vividly. We started off with a plate of 8 chicken wings ($11.99), which our server helpfully presented with a sampler of sauces on the side instead of coating said wings. This let me experience how awesome the wings were with only salt and pepper, and proper battering and frying. They're as good as any which I've had if not better.  Let's get to the sauces too. The honey butter was the only actual dressing listed on the menu, and it was underwhelming for me. The honey and butter both weren't that pronounced. The gochujang was the not-so-spicy base of the Angry Sauce and was about as good as you'll find, give or take lack of spiciness. The tamarind caramel, which I believe is the accompaniment of the Son in Law Deviled Eggs, was also very enjoyable, but I prefer the original Flock & Fowl's Thai Caramel.  Let's get to my main course though: the Laksa ($16.99). I saw it on Chef Sheridan's Instagram a couple of weeks ago and have been eager to try it ever since then, so this was truly the only entree option which I was ready to entertain. The soup is reasonably sized, more of a ramen than a pho. The curry broth was really amazing and not too spicy for me. Egg noodles and chicken soaked up that broth, and the poached egg enriched it. Pretty much everything was awesome except for the slightly empty shrimp head, which ended up being more troublesome due to dispersed hard shells and legs than it was worth the added flavor.  Couple notes on nibbles from my friends' plates: the vegetable hash, featuring tofu, corn, chili peppers, and some other bits, was a work of art in balance of flavors and textures. The fried chicken skins, topped with an aioli that perhaps had rosemary in it, were excellent, as I'd anticipated after trying the wings. The curly fries were fairly standard but had the right textures and seasoning, and the truffle aioli on the side of that was beautiful.  I mostly stuck to water because it was the end of the night, but I tried a bit of my friends' libations. The Mezcal Milk Tea was nice in theory but the oolong was overpowered by the Mezcal. As for the Hitachino Dai Dai, I haven't seen that brewery's products around town so I appreciated the effort by the restaurant to procure it. I did enjoy it as nice red ale, but I didn't understand at all why it was labeled an IPA. There wasn't much hoppiness in it.  Flock & Fowl has successfully made the leap to an awesome downtown Las Vegas space and revamped its menu enough to justify the new prices. I will definitely come back during the day for some better lighting and at night if I find myself in the area for other reasons again."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant, I think it only opened a month or two ago, so service is expected to be a little inconsistent and slow, but it wasn't. We were here for a long wedding weekend and some of us stepped out to eat here one night based on the recommendation of someone staying in our hotel. Man, it didn't disappoint. I ordered a dish called Hainan Chicken, it was really good, very hearty. Portions were average sized, not out of this world large, but it's Vegas and it was not expensive, so who really cares. Just the perfect blend of seasonings, everything was good, even the sides. The rice was pretty good, maybe a bit standard, but good nonetheless. This restaurant is small, only a few tables, so it might be too tight for some people's tastes, but I was cool with the intimacy of the place and the tastiness of my meal. I was told my dish was organic, which is cool and all, but not a requirement by any means. I don't know if it was organic, but if it was, it was healthy and tasty. I was impressed, it was better than when I've eaten in China Town in NY."}
{"text":"Remember when I wasn't willing to give five stars for the food? Now I am.  Flock & Fowl continues to serve awesome chicken-centric food inspired by Chinese and other cuisines. Although they've not yet expanded their evening-less Tuesday-Saturday hours, they're still worth visiting for fantastic food and typically great service. And they are not afraid to experiment and offer new creations from their kitchen.  The Indo fried rice ($12.99) is one of my new favorites of anything food-wise. It started as a popular special and appears to have been promoted to regular menu status. Having never tried nasi goreng, I can't speak to the authenticity of this particular preparation. but I can vouch steadfastly for its huge flavors. The dish is supposed to be a soy sauce-based fried rice, which certainly explains the dark color and awesome umami in every single bite of Indo fried rice. The meat portion is pretty generous too, and it comes in the forms of chicken, Chinese sausage, and bacon. If that's not enough, there's even more richness from the 63 degree egg, aka perfectly poached yolk and white. You should plan to take home leftovers or share it with a friend because it's so heavy - but in the best way.  They may have reneged a little on the Half Sweet & Half Spicy chicken wing combo ($9.49 for 8 wings) since my prior visit, but I'm sure they'll entertain a request for it if they're not too busy. That order allowed me to enjoy equal amounts of their terrific Thai Caramel wings (about which I've already waxed poetic in my first review) and their newer Honey Butter Sriracha wings. The Sriracha tastes like it came out of a bottle, and I say that as a huge compliment as a fan of this sweet and spicy chili sauce. The honey butter lends richness and sweetness that balances out the heat. Another must-try.  Having paid attention to social media this week, I just made a visit today to try two new (or new-to-me) specials. The newly debuted Banh Mi Nachos ($7.99) are a surprising contender for best banh mi in a very lackluster town (note: still gotta try a few newer spots) despite lacking the namesake bread. There's plenty of starch and crunch from the housemade potato chips though, and the chicken liver pate mousse, avocado mayo, pickled carrot and daikon, cilantro, and Fresno pepper provide most if not all of the expected flavors.  The Toast Duo ($7.99) was my other choice, and Chef Sheridan mentioned on Instagram that it's an old special that's now back. Portion/price considerations aside, I'm not sure why it went away. One piece of the crunchy toast is topped with smoked duck that's a successful play on smoked ham, hard-boiled egg, and smashed avocado. The other piece has a healthy dollop of that silky chicken liver mousse, a sweet orange marmalade that plays very well off the mousse, and almond slivers. I slightly preferred the pate mousse, but both are must-try options if you see them offered on the menu  I've tried other foods in my return visits. They occasionally offer a Congee special that's a classic rice porridge plus 63 degree egg with chicken done multiple ways (fried and Hainan I believe were two of them). Their Katsu Sando ($8.99) is another upgraded-to-normal-menu item with marinated, breaded, fried chicken tenders, shredded cabbage, egg sauce, and housemade potato chips. It's a great option if you want your chicken in bread instead of bao. They've also started providing limited desserts recently, and although I had to take the Coconut Panna Cotta w/ Tropical Fruit ($4.75) to-go, it was a refreshing treat that can help to lighten up a meal's end (even though I had it at the beginning).  With a solid core menu and a variety of delicious specials and \"permanent\" specials, Flock and Fowl is definitely one of the best lunch spots around town. I won't hold my breath for it to become a dinner spot as well, but I do hope that I keep seeing Jenny around from time to time. She really is the best, most hospitable host, but she has a lot on her plate and capable employees in her stead. And in the end, the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I made it a point to stop at Flock & Fowl after reading rave reviews about this place because I am a huge Hainanese chicken foodie. I am only in Vegas for the weekend so today is the only day it is open and it closes at 3:30 pm. I made a deliberate stop here at just after 2 pm...nearly an hour and a half before closing. And the waitress tells me that they are sold out of the poached Hainanese chicken - and they ALWAYS sell out about this time. Um, what? If you \"always\" sell out an hour and a half before closing, wouldn't you know to make more next time?!? And it's your MAIN dish!! It's not like I'm asking for white truffles on poached blowfish - it's the chicken that is supposedly your staple bread and butter dish!! That's like Pizza Hut running out of pizza!!  It's so ridiculous that's it's absurd! I was also planning on visiting their sister restaurant also, but have scrapped it from our plans since we don't know what they'll be out of if we go there. Maybe the food is good, but we will never know. Thumbs down for poor management."}
{"text":"I had a chance to meet Chef Sheridan Su a few years ago when he first opened up his restauraunt, \"Fat Choy,\" just east of the Las Vegas Strip. There, Chef Sheridan created an ecclectic fusion of classic American diner-style and Asian comfort-style food. The menu includes items like Pork Belly Bao with pickled mustard greens, cilantro and crushed peanuts. As well, there are sandwiches like Short-Rib Grilled Cheese which are finished with an onion jam, provolone and chedder cheese. Both are rich and tasty offerings, served up in the corner of a very intersting location. It's a spot we would reccomend trying out if you haven't already.   With \"Flock & Fowl,\" Chef Su takes a lighter look at Asian food with a Hainan approach to preparation. By casual definition, Hainan style is derived from the recipes of the peoples of Hainan province in China. The food is lighter, less oily, and more mildly seasoned than that of the Chinese mainland.  When we visited, we chose to go with what we were told was the House Specialty: \"Mary's Free Range Poached Chicken\".  (pictured above.) It was a real treat! Light and flavorful, the poached chicken is prepared in a seasoned broth and served chilled with seasoned rice. The dish includes a selection of house-made sauces and on our recent visit we chose to pair it with sauteed asaparagus. Other pairings such as fried chicken skins and a fried egg were also available.   Along side the poached chicken, we also sampled the Sriracha Chicken Wings. The  wings were zesty and spicy without coming off unblanced. The wings were very good, and with 4 wings to the order it was enough for a nice lunch paired with the chicken dish.   flock and Fowl is located not far from the SLS Casino and Hotel, just West of the corrner of Las Vegas Blvd & Sahara. Get there soon. They are currently only open Tuesday - Saturday   10:30 am - 3:30pm, so plan your visit accordingly. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"}
{"text":"We ordered:  Hainanese chicken rice plate with 1/4 Mary's free range poached chicken (#1) and added a side of chicken broth, Chinese sausage, and veggies. The poached chicken was borderline dry, just okay, I had to drench it in soy sauce and ginger scallion sauce. Folks can consider adding $2 for dark meat wich might be juicier. The side of chicken broth was very oily and gamey and would be great if used to make soup or gravy as it is legit chicken broth BUT not so much as a soup - SKIP. The Chinese sausage was okay, very little and in small pieces - SKIP. The side veggies appeared to be maybe one or two batches of baby bok choy, for the price point - SKIP as well.   Hainanese chicken rice plate with buttermilk fried chicken tenders (#2) was great. Nice piece of fried chicken but didn't match the rice plate. Speaking of rice, it was bland and can use additional seasoning. The establishment should consider pulling #2 out of the rice plate section and have it as an a-la-carte item (and add ketchup please!).  Night Market fried chicken bao was awesome! Very delicious, like I said before, a nice piece of fried chicken!  With that said, if you're looking for Hainanese chicken, this place is OKAY but if you want some delicious five spice buttermilk fried chicken, this place is GREAT."}
{"text":"After catching a 51s game in the afternoon we stopped for a bite to eat here. Parking is across the street and you pay at a kiosk at the corner. It was a relaxed environment and we were quickly greeted by friendly staff members. This restaurant is paperless, so cash is not accepted. I ordered a coffee infused manhattan which I enjoyed. It was evenly mixed and the bourbon was delightful.  We decided to order an appetizer and went for the chicken wings. We decided on an eight piece and were able to try two flavors (honey butter and salt & pepper). The wings had delicious flavor and the skin was very crispy. Even the honey butter wings had a crispy skin with the sauce smothered on the outside. Honey butter was a sweet and spicy flavor, with just enough heat to know it was there. Not over bearing at all.  For entrees we selected the Laksa and the Hainanese Chicken rice. The chicken was fried and the sides were fried egg and market veggies. Food arrived quickly and was everything we had hoped for. It was my first time trying Laksa and the depth of flavor was amazing. Chicken and tofu went together nicely and had amazing flavor. The preparation of the tofu was so good that even the pickiest eater would enjoy it.  As for the Hainanese Chicken, it arrived with three distinct sauces on the side. Skin was crispy much like the wings from the appetizer. The rice stole the show on the plate. I'm not sure how the rice was prepared, but it is some of the best rice I have ever had. Vegetables were carrots and mixed greens. They complimented the dish well.  The dining experience was pleasant and the staff were attentive to customer needs. Again it is a paperless restaurant so no cash is accepted. I would recommend trying the chicken wings when dining here and the laksa."}
{"text":"Very nice place with great ambience. I love our server, Troy. He's such a thoughtful and caring guy. He made sure that we were well taken care of and that we enjoyed our experience. One thing that is noteworthy about Troy is when we weren't satisfied with our egg drop soup (it was salty), he took it back to reheat it and gave us more broth to dilute the taste down. He's definitely the sweetest. Love him!"}
{"text":"Delicious simplicity or should I say simply delicious? I wish I could try some of the other offerings but being an out of town visitor, I didn't want to stuff myself when there are so many other places to try. I would've given 5 stars but I do think the chicken rice is a bit overpriced, at least compared to how much you would pay for it anywhere that's not Vegas."}
{"text":"My continual quest to recreate some of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice dishes I had during my month long vacation in Asia in 2017, brought me to Flock & Fowl.  Every chicken and rice dish I had in Singapore (my all-time favorite), Thailand, Hong Kong, and Vietnam were fondly memorable, all with its own unique twists, representative of their countries of origin.  Unfortunately, Flock & Fowl came nowhere close to bringing back those fond sensories I long for.    Interestingly, Flock & Fowl does attempt to create its own take on its signature Hainanese Chicken Rice ($14.99).  It's more of an nontraditional, but nouveau take on a traditional beloved Asian dish.  Everything is made in house, from the ginger and scallion sauce, the pickled vegetables, the chile sauce, and down to even the soy sauce.  However, maybe they should continue retooling these recipes a bit before actually serving them.  The ginger and scallion sauce, which is often made by home cooks, including myself, was downright bland.  Adding some sea salt and more scallions really would've given it the needed oomph. Conversely, their in-house made soy sauce had a distinct medicinal flavor, that reminded me of the potent Chinese herbal medicinal soups my Mom forced down my brother and I when we were little.  Any Chinese kid who has experienced this, knows that it's definitely not something you'd want to serve at a restaurant, unless you're trying to sway off customers from ever returning.  And why would you want to dip your perfectly poached Hainanese Chicken into something like that?    Now, the all-white Hainanese chicken, served with skin on, was very nicely done.  Perfectly moist, though small in portion size, given the price.  No complaints here. I also liked the perfectly prepared one hour egg, made in the sous vide.   The rice, which was made from the chicken schmaltz, also tasted bland, as did the watered down tasting bone broth.  Typically the broth that accompanies this dish is very flavorful, but again, maybe they need to go back to the drawing board on these two items as well.  Wasn't a fan of the ambiance so much.  The dining area was somewhat small and long.  It's perfectly fine for a simple lunch if you work downtown, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for dinner here. I came from Summerlin, and frankly, was disappointed I made the trip across town.  Oddly, they did something annoying that I've never seen at a restaurant before.  When you're seated, you can't help but to see a large bottle of Vero water placed on each of the tables.  They look appealing when you're thirsty, as they're in a nice frosty bottle, that look like they may already be chilled.  However, I was immediately asked upon being seated if I wanted regular tap water, or if I'd like to purchase the bottle for $4.00.  I passed on $4.00 for water, and the waitress quickly snatched up the bottle. **IMO, this was some strange greedy, passive aggressive \"sales technique\" contrived by the owners to accost an additional $4.00 or more from every table**! I have no problem at all with offering bottled water, as many restaurants commonly do, but I really don't care for that sort of annoying tacky approach of displaying your goods for sale, right on top the table!!   Apparently, the chef here was a James Beard Award Semifinalist.  Note, not a winner but semifinalist.  Regardless, it says little about the final product served day in and day out.  Numerous low-keyed restaurants all over serve phenomenal food in great settings, but never get the recognition and awards because they aren't versed in pumping up the public relations (usually paid for), and playing the political games necessary to \"achieve\" these kinds of accolades.    All that being said, if you're in downtown and craving Hainanese Chicken Rice, then this may be your only option.  Beggars can't be choosers. Personally, if given a choice, I'd opt instead for Spring Mountain any day, or somewhere in Chinatown, where the options are plentiful, much better tasting, authentic, and better priced.  My quest continues on...  P.S.  Difficult parking during lunch time."}
{"text":"Hipster, that's one word that comes to mind when walking into this restaurant. They don't even take cash, ok. We ordered 2 chicken and rice w/dark meat togo, total was $41. I'm not one to complain too much on price, but this was a little much. I mean, it's just chicken and rice. I'll have to pass on this, $4 extra for dark meat? Highway robbery if you ask me. I'm too old school for this joint, bye."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid place. I would definitely come back if I were in the area. It's an odd location though. This isn't an area I come to often.   I had the indo rice special which is just a fried rice plate with some chicken and sausage bits and a poached egg. They bring out some sauces with some of the other meals, but not this one. If you get the indo rice dish, ask for the sauces, it elevates it with a little kick.  This is a tiny place though. I would not recommend coming with a large group. This is a 1~2 person place like a lunch date."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! The food is FANTASTIC and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. If you're in the mood for something new this is the perfect place!"}
{"text":"Came downtown to check out this cool new eat. Never could make it during operation hours to the other location, so downtown is a perfect fit! On the old Itsy Bitsy space, and boy is it a whole different world. The food game here is on poiiiiint! Will def be back soon. Do yourself the flavor and when they recommend the chocolate chip cookie, get it put in ASAP. They bake them fresh on the spot in a mini cast iron skillet and it takes about 10 mins. There's ice cream, there's a miso caramel sauce. You won't regret it at all. There's actually no pic of it because we devoured it before I could even think to take one!  Downtown Vegas stepping their game up!"}
{"text":"A 15 min walk from stratosphere hotel. We found something Asian to eat and it's very delicous keeping it within the Asian vibe. Ordered the hai nan chicken and roasted chicken and both was very delicous especially the sauces but their portion is small and came with water and drink was off though but okay. Coming back next month again for more. Wish portion can be bigger though."}
{"text":"Limited menu done well. Both Hainan chicken poached and with Cornish game hen were tasty with yummy dipping sauces, flavorful rice, and an interesting assortment of sides, some of which were selected and some were just part of presentation. Server Anthony was fantastic, detailing what menu items are and making recommendations and being generally attentive and so pleasant one of my friends said he might be the politest server he ever came across. Overall friendly vibe and eclectic and not overly loud music."}
{"text":"Umm.... Are you sure it's safe to eat here? Don't let the neighborHOOD scare you away, Flock & Fowl is next door to a barred up pawn shop in an area too far from the strip for tourists yet too close to the strip for locals to be. The area isn't the best, but once you step inside you'll forget all of your worries.  The decorations are cute, the tables are cute (but also impractical- my keys kept falling through the spacings on the little table and I felt like any sudden movement would knock it over... and I'm not THAT strong ;) ) and the waitresses make you feel extremely welcome.  The food was beautiful and also delicious. We ordered the poached hainan chicken and the spring chicken. The spring chicken tastes like a fancy rotisserie chicken wing. Good, but I prefer the poached. I thought this goes without saying, but YES the poached chicken is cooked and NOT raw. I heard several newbies asking if the chicken was cooked lolololol c'mon guys do you really think they're serving raw chicken on Sahara Avenue? The rice is flavorful and perfect. I could eat the rice all day.  My issue with Flock & Fowl was the lack of space that made me feel uncomfortable and rushed. The line can reach out the door (fine, that's unfair the doors like 10ft from the counter), but the amount of people in line hovered over you while eating makes it hard to enjoy the food. But I guess the portions are so small you aren't in there for long anyways. That bring up my second issue. The prices are low, however the portions are small. I would consider Flock & Fowl a place I would go for a snack and not a meal. BUT I haven't found a place in Vegas that serves Hainan chicken as good as Flock & Fowls so I will be back! .... With less valuables in my car this time so I'm not constantly checking through the window to see if my cars been robbed ;) Spread the word so Flock & Fowl can expand!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to Flock and Fowl due to great reviews on Yelp and high recommendations from friends. Decided to finally come on a Wednesday around 11 with my cousin. I got their specialty which was the Hainanese Poached Chicken with side order of broth and my cousin got their Salad with Roasted Organic Chicken. Decided to also order us the Chicken Tender Bao.   My Poached Chicken was flavorful and delicious. I've tried Hiananese Chicken where it's been dry and flavor came from the sauce but at Flock and Fowl every aspect of the dish was packed with flavor. The Poached Chicken was moist and rice had a nice gingery lemongrass taste to it. The three housemade sauces were delicious and enjoyable with the chicken. The Chicken Tender Bao were amazing!! One big piece of crunchy moist chicken tender on a pillowy steamed bao bun with crunchy fresh pea shoots and sweet salty sauce that brought the whole thing together. The nice surprise was actually the Salad with Roasted Chicken. It was big, fresh and plenty of delicious textures. There was spinach, shaved carrots, stone fruits, edamame, quinoa, snap peas, mangoes, nuts!! It was a nice surprise in every bite. The roasted chicken was perfectly executed. Crispy, moist, and like everything we had... Intense in flavor.   Paid about $30 for everything. However I feel the money was worth it. Portion size were big, every dish was flavorful and you can really tell the ingredients were fresh and I think it makes a big difference. A bonus is the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Place is really small and no restroom, but next door is a costume store where Flock and Fowl customers are allowed to use their restroom. I personally didn't mind the small size or no restrooms because it adds to uniqueness to the experience. Definitely a gem of a place and will be taking visiting family and friends here for the superb food and experience.   Recommend coming here before 12ish cause I did notice as we were done eating it started to get busy."}
{"text":"(I promise this isn't an Uber/Lyft ad, but this is a terrific example of being able to come across some great eateries around LV that isn't on the strip and really is thanks to ride sharing services for those that fly in/don't have cars.)  Now that we have that out of the way, Flock & Fowl is a fascinating little restaurant near the North Side of the Strip and although the hours are short and the menu fairly simple, it's a recommended treat.    The menu mainly consists around various Chinese Chicken dishes.  This includes the Hainan Chicken which is about $10 (in three variants of poached/fried/roasted) that includes chicken rice and a few sides/sauces.  They also have fried chicken bao, Thai caramel chicken wings and even some salad variants.  Look on the board as you enter to the left for a few specials that included some noodle dishes too that sounded delicious.    Being my first rodeo, I aimed for the Hainan Chicken poached with all the ingredients along with unsweetened iced green tea.  After a short wait at a comfy table near the window, I received the beautifully prepared plate - something that surprised me at first glance.  Simple and sleek are the last things I think of when I mention Hainan Chicken and yet here we are.  Sauces neatly to the right; the cucumber/mustard greens neatly to the top (wish there was more of them), the rice neatly stacked nearest me and finally the chicken all stacked oddly in a beautiful manner.  The presentation wasn't only good; the chicken (served at room temperature which they can heat more if you'd like) was solid as well as the rest of the dishes.  The standouts for me were the sauces and the mustard/cucumber which added zing and pizazz to the dish more than just a standard soy sauce/ginger mix might bring.  There were some terrific flavor combinations happening and I happily enjoyed mixing and matching all of them.    Special thanks to Liz/Amber for making me feel really welcome and doing a great job both explaining the dishes and checking up.  The restaurant itself isn't too big - they do have benches for waiting on the side.  The decor is nice/simple  My only qualms are that I wish they were open in the evenings and that seating can get crowded fairly quickly.  They aren't too far from the Strip if you also plan to hoof it but Uber/Lyft make it that much easier plus the parking lot is fairly plentiful.    Flock & Fowl is a welcome surprise that wins a lot of big points for me thanks to a mix of great presentation, terrific/personal service and tasty food.  Can't wait to stop by again to try more."}
{"text":"Great food!  The indo fried rice, sriracha wings and bao were all great flavors and nicely portioned. The service is friendly, efficient and personalized. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this little lunch spot. Terrific food full of flavor - and very reasonably priced.   Don't miss it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!!! The food and the staff were great! I will definetely come back and bring my family and more friends!!! Try it!!!! Soooo delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Simple menu with excellent execution.    Completely reasonable with high quality ingredients.   Good and caring service.  Worth the trek to the strip mall."}
{"text":"This location was not I what I expect it! The food was good/alright not the same as the other location by Sahara. I was bummed they didn't have the deviled eggs, but anyways, the staff was super accommodating, and very friendly. It just took a little while to get our food and our bill. (It was a busy Thursday night)"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and the food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the special, pork egg rolls, for an app and the sweet chili sauce was on point. They were fresh, hot and full of flavor. The blood orange tea was a new thing for me, but also amazing. Very refreshing and needed absolutely no additives for flavor. Eat here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Recently, I've been experiencing a case of \"choice fatigue\" from all my dining adventures. My colleague introduced me to this phrase and explained it's a legit term where we're so exhausted in making a decision (in this case what to eat) and we are completely indifferent.  But here comes Flock & Fowl which came highly recommended by my two LV aces Chris V. and Rod U. (HI) who steered me into this tiny off the strip joint for a hearty lunch.   With my choice fatigue at its peak, I was so relieved to see the limited menu of chicken dishes. My decision making took less than a minute as I gladly ordered #1 Hainanese Chicken Rice $9.99. The plate consisted of a beautifully poached free range boneless chicken, a mount of savory seasoned rice, tangy pickled vegetables and three sauces to accompany the main attraction. The white meat was delicate and tender where you are able to taste the freshness of the chicken. It didn't have that in-your-face seasoning.   On the side, they served three homemade sauces: ginger scallion, chile and soy. All of them delicious in their own way but I'm more of a traditionalist and gravitated to the ginger scallion.   I can understand how the price or quantity doesn't add up but once you have a taste of the chicken you'll be able to taste the difference of this \"cleaner\" version.   Very simple process of ordering and pay at the counter, grab a number, take a seat and the staff will deliver your dish. The restaurant is very small and crowded but was efficient to get diners in and out without any delay. I noticed more take out orders than dining in.   The only disappointment is they're closed all day Sunday and Monday and do not serve dinner. There goes another choice I gotta make for the next meal!   In this case, life is not about making choices; it's about making the right decision."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! Clean and beautiful straight forward food. Must try and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding chicken, chicken rice, bok choy, homemade pickles and dipping sauces. Love this place. Wish they would expand nationally."}
{"text":"DEEELISH!!! From Hainan Chicken Rice to Caramel Wings, I'm definitely a fan! I've been honestly craving the wings since trying them a few weeks ago. The flavors are legit, Hainan Chicken Rice was amazing! I do not eat a lot of rice but I could not stop eating it!! The Caramel Wings were crunchy, sweet, and surprisingly large.  The establishment is pretty small and there is one, very sweet hostess/waitress/cashier, I mean she does it all, FAST! The restaurant is charming and modern, there is a menu and specials hanging on the left wall. While we waited for our food, it people kept pulling in, looks like it stays pretty busy, and I mean why wouldn't it? it's so good! All in all, the food warrants a visit!"}
{"text":"I got the hainan poached chicken with Chinese sausage and broth for extra. The meal was great, I could do without the broth. The broth tasted funky to me. Great customer service and friendly workers. It's a small place, I wanted to eat here but I felt crowded so I got it to go."}
{"text":"I found this place just off Fremont and it was good.  I should have taken advantage of their mix of house mixed drinks, but I just wasn't feeling it.   I ordered the butcher steak w the craft lager beer and both were good.  When they asked how I wanted my steak cooked, I told them to have the chef cook it how much he/she thinks it should be cooked....well they cooked it near medium rare and it was amazing-cooked to perfection.   Food was good Beer was good Cool spot"}
{"text":"Best Hainanese steamed chicken I've had outside of China and Hong Kong. They only serve a few things but every item is outstanding and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Flock and Fowl looked very vacant and a bit uninviting at the beginning. Once we placed our order in and got the food, it was totally worth it. I ordered the poached chicken with a fried egg and Chinese sausages, while my sister ordered the fried chicken with fried egg and chicken broth. The rice was so savory, buttery. The poached chicken soft and tender. The fried chicken, perfectly crispy. The service was decent. My sister ordered the roasted hen, but was given the fried chicken, which worked out nicely."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far one of the top ten restaurants to vist in Las Vegas and if you haven't been to Fat Choy either, add that to the list as well."}
{"text":"I had their signature dish: poached chicken. Delicious! also had fried chicken skins and Chinese sausage. i wish we had this in Nashville!"}
{"text":"Just WOW!  First things first... Being someone who has been in the hospitality industry for over 6 years. I am rarely impressed by the service of others.  Except for today!  We were greeted by both bartenders and front of house as well which were so nice and welcoming.  We sat and were greeted by our server Troy.  He was super detailed and answered all our questions patiently. We could tell he knew his stuff.  He checked on us several times, went over happy hour times, and even boxed our food.  I felt so taken care of.  Will definitely be bringing my friends here!"}
{"text":"Needed a place to eat after a fun night at downtown. Figured I would try out this place. Guys let me tell you. This place landed wayyyy past my expectations! You have to hit up their chicken and rice. Super chill experience will for sure return."}
{"text":"Love flock an fowl!! Simple yet elegant. Staff is awesome. Jenny is great and very attentive. Can't go wrong w the staple hainan chicken and rice. I used to go to their other location but I will be going to this one going forward for one reason, flocktails!!"}
{"text":"Wow... where to begin! This place is fantastic! Honest to goodness some of the BEST chicken I have ever had! My wife and I are huge fans of this restaurant, and  try to make it here at least a few times a month. Recently I tried their Thai Chicken Wings and they absolutely blew my mind. Simply amazing. Two thumbs all the way up!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken rice in Las Vegas! Just as good as chicken rice in Singapore.  Truly authentic.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Flock is such a gem in our little desert! After leaving Cali (specifically Monterey Park) 3 years ago, I would always crave Hainan Chicken Rice. Every time I drove back home, I would always make a stop at Savoy, a joint in Cali known for their hainan chicken rice. I am happy to say that I no longer need to make that trip! Flock and Fowl tastes just like home! My husband actually prefers Flock over Savoy. I think the only thing that Savoy has an edge over is their spicy sauce.  The food is top notch! I always come here every Friday on my days off, and order 2 hainanese chicken rice each time to-go (1 for the hubby and 1 for myself). When we get a chance to dine in, we will order 2 hainan chicken rices to eat at the restaurant, and 2 to-go. That's how delicious Flock makes their signature dish!  The customer service is also top notch, especially Jenny! I'm always greeted by my name whenever I enter, and it amazes me how every time I'm in there, she greets almost every customer walking into her restaurant by their name. You know your food and service is great when almost every customer entering your shop is a regular.   See you next Friday, Flock & Fowl :p"}
{"text":"This is problady one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas off the busy strip. This place has amazing favors and every dish is made to its own perfection. I tried the Hainan chicken rice a while back ago when I was visiting a very special friend in Vegas and I can say that every time I come here it never disappoints. The chicken was moist and fresh and I love the rice it reminds me of my great grandmas Hainan chicken especially when it's pair with the crack sauce. It's so addicting I can just drink it like an appetizer. The service is great and the ambiance is very hip and modern. If you want get your fusion fix come here. It's definitely a culinary experience you won't forget."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Friendly service.  After multiple visits to the famous nong's khao man gai in Portland, and several visits to Thailand.    I have to give it up to flock and fowl for the tenderness and flavor of their chicken. Great dipping. Sauces,  not a huge fan of their broth, but still 5 stars and one of the best meals I had this trip."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't to long, and the buttermilk chicken was very good and well prepared. The rice was a good compliment to the chicken and came with 3 little sides of sauces, soy sauce, ginger, and a hot sauce. Down fall is that they have no restroom...Thank you I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food and such nice people.  I've only been to the one on Sahara, which is closed now for remodeling.  I'll have to check out downtown location.  Great menu!"}
{"text":"The happy hour at the flock and fowl is just phenomenal it is so great and the food and the people that work there are so wonderful I love it it's called 3 6 happy hour come down"}
{"text":"I visited Flock and Fowl with my entire Vegas party of 6 people on my most recent trip. First off, the service was excellent and we were not the only party there. Jenny was amazing and couldn't have been nicer. On to the food - we tried a few things off he menu and everything was fantastic. Flock and Fowl is known for their special Chicken hainan dish and thus the restaurant is aptly named. If you come here you must order it! Or at least a try it if someone else orders it. It's amazing. We also had some Szechuan wings and those were fantastic as well. Make sure to check their hours before you come in as they are only open for lunch. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Sin City."}
{"text":"After we passed by an erotic museum and a gun shop on the way to Flock & Fowl, I was certain that we were lost. But we continued onwards and found Flock & Fowl tucked inside a strip mall area. The inside looked warm and cozy, somewhat of a contrast to the location.  I was greeted by a waitress here, who explained to me their menu. While everything sounded great, I came here for one thing and one thing only - the Hainan chicken. I added in a fried chicken bao and chicken broth as sides since I was starving.  The food was great - I don't need to say more. The quality of the chicken was superb, the sauces were exactly how I like them, the fried chicken bao was super crispy... YUM! So happy that I ventured just a bit outside of the strip to try Flock & Fowl."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up on Hainan Chicken Rice, I can honestly say this was the best I've had in America. Almost 7 years in America and I've finally found a restaurant with HCR I'm willing to recommend.  I also love the other variations they have on the menu, especially the Hainan Chicken Congee... It was a special menu item that I hope will become a permanent menu item. Ridiculously good, especially with the extra poached chicken! I'm looking forward to eating my way through the rest of the menu!  Other awesome parts: the poached chicken is boneless (great for the hubby who doesn't like bones), the sauces are homemade and just amazing, and Jenny is super friendly and took the time to explain the menu, ingredients, and sauces.   I really appreciate that Jenny and the chef accommodated us as we walked in more or less right on closing time. I was prepared to be turned away, so I can't thank them enough for going the extra mile."}
{"text":"Experience:  I've eaten at Fat Choy and heard this was the new hybrid chicken restaurant from the same owners. Besides all my YELP friends have given it such fantastic reviews, so had to come try.  Annnddd, its in my neighborhood! :) I came with a girlfriend on a Sat at 2:30. As everyone else mentioned, it's only open very select hours, so be aware.   Facility: This is located in the strip mall next to the strip mall where Golden Steer is. It's a very small spot with only a few tables and chairs. There are a few chairs in the side to wait if you decide to get Togo. It's very quaint with a clean, modern feel. There was a TV on the wall, but thankfully it wasn't on. They are playing a great soulful, neo-soul type music, that I LOVE!!!    Service: I met the owner Jenny, and she was super nice and helpful. She describes everything as she places it on your table. Then she comes back to check how you like it, and if you need anymore sauce, etc. Phenomenal service!  Food: We ordered several dishes to try. Jenny said the chicken was all organic, range free chicken out of a farm in California. Good to know!  Chicken Bao - 4/5 - I liked this, but while I was eating it, I was craving more sauce flavor. The chicken strip itself is soaked in buttermilk, and it was cooked perfectly.   Chicken Wings - 5/5 - we tried both kinds and they both were decisions. The Thai were deep fried with a crispy coating and yummy sauce. The Szechwan were fried and braised, and the sauce was amazing.    Hainan chicken with an egg and sausage - 4/5 - This was very good. The sauces were good. And I loved the Chinese sausage add-on! It had almost a sweet finish to it. You really have to try it next time you order the Hainan. Unfortunately, this is nothing against the chef, but I love salt on any eggs, and also on white rice, so I kept wishing I had some salt to add to this dish.   Overall: Great little spot with a specialized menu. Jenny is awesome and really sets the tone for a great dinning experience. Plus these were some of the best wings I've had in Vegas. I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"F&F is living up to their original location, with much more gusto! The interior is GORGEOUS! The new menu additions that I've tried are fantastic and I can't wait to experience the rest.   With their new bar they have an expansive drink menu which not only includes their usual teas, but also cocktails, beers, and wines! I went with a dark roast tieguanyin hot tea, which warmed me right up!   They've adopted their perfect old menu and included new items which I agree with this fantastic method of why break it if, it isn't broken! Their hainan chicken now comes as a combo. You get to choose two sides now! I chose broth and a perfect 63 degree egg! I like to put some of the delicious chicken fat rice and the chicken in the broth and make a little soup out of it, pardon me while I drool a little....   All in all, get your butt down to Flock&Fowl!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe we were expecting more based on the reviews, but in our minds, the food was decent but not enough to come back for next time given all the other options in the city.   We had the Signature chicken dish and the fried chicken sandwich. The signature chicken was tender but lacking in flavor. Three dipping sauces were provided but didn't add too much.  The fried chicken sandwich was good. Good ratio of coleslaw to fried chicken to bread. Curly fries that came with it weren't crispy though."}
{"text":"Maybe I expected too much, food wasn't super, not a lot of menu variety. Only 5 choices when I got there today. The worst part is \"no restroom\" in the restaurant. The closest one is at the next street mall......"}
{"text":"Super delicious Hainanese chicken and rice joint.  I hate raw ginger but I licked all the ginger out of the dish and rubbed it all over my damn chicken.  Rice was amazing, I was told it's cooked in chicken fat and broth.  Jesus.  Yum.  Thai wings were ridiculous.  Too bad I only had room for 4.  Waitress seemed busy and generally anxious.  But knew the names of all the customers.  I was feeling anxious yet hospitable.  Strange but in a good way."}
{"text":"They only do a handful of things, but they do them really well. This is well worth the trip off the Strip for something authentic. The atmosphere is spare - a tiny space with friendly and extremely efficient service. The line moves fast and you'll not be lingering after your meal."}
{"text":"This place put all Hainan chicken rice places to shame including the famous Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra.  Signature Hainanese Chicken rice ($14.99) with the choice of two sides. They use good quality chicken, the meat is dense and the skin is without excess fat. The rice is also perfectly cooked like they did pay attention to details. I have to say their flavor is like 95% similar to what I used to have daily in Thailand with much better quality.   The choices of the sides: 1 hour egg (poached egg) is the way to go.  Chinese sausage is a bit salty to my like but it's what it is. (I quit preserved food for a long tim). Daily vegetables (bowl of corn for that day, I don't like it much and didn't get the flavor either, I prefer just some simple freshly cooked vegetables instead).  Broccoli and Quinoa Salad $8.99 if you like broccoli and quinoa it's a perfect combination, flavorful but so light . The slightly crspy tofu is enjoyable. I can see myself eating this dish daily.  Farmer Market Salad I got it complimentary from the chef, he told me all the ingredients were from downtwon farmer market, the vegetables taste wild with the amazing natural sweetness. I love this dish!   Laksa (coconut curry noodle)$16.99 too salty for me and not the kind of noodle I was expecting even though menu said egg noodle (also too soggy ).   Son in Law Deviled Eggs $8.99 I never had Devil's egg so I can't compare it with normal version. The flavor is too mixed to me which I prefer food just to it's simplest taste at best. Well prepared though.   Cookie A La Mode $7 if you like American kind sweetness, the flavor is actually rich with the crunch texture around the hot cast iron. Too sweet for me and it's also too much for just one person to consume.   They got quite busy during lunch hours but slow during the dinner hours. I'd really enjoy the quiet evening there with my favorite food. This place now ranked #1 as my favorite restaurant in DTLV."}
{"text":"I flocked to Flock & Fowl today because I have followed Chef Su and Jenny around town from Great Bao to Fat Choy to here and also the Lucky Rice Night Market thing when it debuted here.  They are a great team.  I freakin' love Hainan chicken rice and my main exposure to it was in Thailand.  I had some at a cheap place mentioned in Lonely Planet in Bangkok on my honeymoon, then again in the Bangkok Airways lounge in the Bangkok Airport, where I think I ate 8 plates of it (in 2011).  Fast forward to summer 2014 and Eric R. and I flew from Bali to Bangkok to Tokyo to the US.  We had a long layover in Bangkok (during the coup, and didn't tell anyone we were flying through there - the government shut off the a/c in the airport so I actually passed out)...first though we stopped at a random restaurant in the airport and I got Hainan chicken rice then passed out in the hot restaurant and then Eric R. dragged me to the gate to Tokyo where I passed out from the heat and exhaustion again.  I do not know when I will actually get to Singapore (where this the national dish), Hainan, or Malaysia any time soon, so I am often on the hunt for this dish.  There are a few places that have it in town but...eh!  In the Little Apple where I live, we have a place that serves cao mun guy (Thai version of this dish) but the chicken is dry.  This dish at Flock & Fowl.....well....the chicken is MOIST! and organic, free range fowl!  No foul here, just fowl.  It was so moist that it needed no sauce, seriously.  The rice was delicious and flavorful.  It was served with pickled mustard greens and cucumbers, broth, plus 3 dipping sauces made in house: sesame soy, ginger-scallion, and sambal.  I liked all of the sauces, and dipped my chicken in a random sauce every bite.  Then I drizzled the sauces on the rice.  I wanted an egg but the last one was ordered by the person before me = darn!  So I took a cab here from the Venetian because I was too impatient to wait for the Deuce.  Due to its location on Sahara with lanes only going westbound and a major accident southbound on Vegas Blvd., I decided to walk back.  Fueled by fowl, I flocked back to Caesars Palace where I returned to my conference, feet burning but tummy smiling.  I hope to come back when the restaurant is out of the soft opening.  I also had a green milk tea which Jenny made to order and adjusted sweetness to my taste (I guess I am a bitter gal because I like unsweetened, bitter green tea).  I am pretty fly for a fowl girl (I am what I eat)!  If only I could have flown from the restaurant to my destination.  Too bad I am leaving or I could go to a foot spa on Spring Mountain.  Flock to this place but be patient as the restaurant works out its opening.  According to Jenny, it is meant for take-out which is why there is limited seating and no public restroom."}
{"text":"I'm Filipino, so I grew up eating a LOT of good chicken: fried chicken, chicken stew, chicken rice, you name it. So, unfortunately, I expect a lot from a chicken place. It's hard to compete with Mom's chicken. Flock & Fowl just knocks it out of the park in that regard.   Whenever I'm here, I feel like I'm getting a home-cooked meal by Mom, if Mom also just won MasterChef America. It's comfort food, but it's creative and thoughtful, too. It's awesome seeing my favorite foods from childhood get some elevated treatment like this.    Hainan Chicken Rice: Light, simple, but soooo good. The chicken is moist and tender, but the secret here is the rice. Perfectly seasoned and super satisfying. I like the traditional style + egg on the side. Perfect for me, but maybe a little too light for some folks? If it sounds too light, I'd go with the roasted style chicken rice or...   Chicken Wings (Salt & Pepper) and/or the Fried Chicken Skins: Salty, crunchy, and full of flavor. Hard to go wrong on these... soooo good.    Any salad on the menu: You wouldn't expect a chicken place to have good salad, but they make seriously good salad. Perfectly balanced with just the right dressing and combination of ingredients. You can taste the quality of the ingredients here (and in all the dishes, really).  Maybe I'm just a little chicken crazy, but I love this place. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Finally made it here last week. Arrived at 10:25 and waited outside til 10:30, went in and people were inside already! But they dont start taking orders til 10:30. My advice get there a little early and look over the menu on the wall.  I had the #1, Hainan chicken rice and added Chinese sausage. The chicken was so moist and tender best of all boneless. My favorite sauce by far was the ginger (actually got extra). The black sauce was okay and that last one was too hot for me. The rice and Chinese sausage were also tasty.  Both my gf and Mom enjoyed their meals too. They both liked the roasted chicken, also moist and tender. A little small but good. My Mom kept raving about the salad.        My gf had the roasted chicken with rice and my Mom had the roasted chicken and salad."}
{"text":"Decent food, but for Vegas, it is very overpriced. Each Hainan chicken dish is about $15 after tax. It is just rice and chicken. There are better options in the area. Also, it is a small place with limited seating. Owner is very strict about ordering first. Drinks (canned sodas and water) are also quite overpriced at $2/can. They are also currently open for lunch tues-sat.   Overall, decent food, but I don't think it's worth ~$15 for just rice and chicken. Not sure if they think Vegas is Singapore, and even if they want to charge a premium price, they should back it up with premium service, which simply doesn't exist right now."}
{"text":"If they had more tables to sit, I'd rate 5 stars. From a simple menu to fresh and organic ingredients, this little hole in the wall does not disappoint! I ordered the fried chicken tenders with Chinese sausage and an iced chrysanthemum tea. Everything tastes great. The sauces were delicious. It may seem like small portions, but I feel it's the perfect amount; you won't walk out too full or still hungry.  The server (only woman working the front) was very kind and polite. She remembers your name as she brings out the food. A nice touch of hospitality. She explains what's in your food and how it's cooked. The price is a bit on the higher side, but you're eating good quality chicken!"}
{"text":"Their signature Hainanese chicken and rice was well made but I wished they offered different dipping sauces? All three (minced ginger, soy, and hot chili) were salt based. I was really looking for something sweet or sour to balance/add a contrast to the dish. Even the side of minced veggies and cucumber slices were marinated in salt.  My husband enjoyed his laksa tremendously. The noodles were cooked well. Plenty of chicken and that shrimp head was just yummmm. The coconut broth was perfectly seasoned. He almost picked up the bowl to lick the last drop.   Overall - foods were delicious, just wished my chicken had a diff dipping sauce. A bit pricy but I guess it's Vegas price after all."}
{"text":"Tried their chicken wings (both flavors), Hainan chicken, (added Taiwanese sausage and egg), spring chicken ,  iced Viet coffee and lemon tea. The Hainan chicken is boneless, soft, juicy with good flavor- comparable to Savoy in LA. The rice has good flavor as well but on the harder side. The sauces are legit!! Definitely try their chicken wings, very flavorful and juicy inside. It's great little restaurant - little restaurant with big flavor!"}
{"text":"This place is such an impressive culinary gem in Vegas! The traditional Haianese Chicken plate is a must. I'm not normally a fan of poached chicken, but their organic free range chicken and the delicious sauces and chicken-fat rice go together so beautifully. The fried chicken nap and the Sambal chicken wings are also super delicious. Can't go wrong with this spot if you love chicken and Chinese food... A definite must try!"}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  I have an obsession with hainan chicken so I knew I had to try this place. I ordered the famous hainan chicken with an egg and chicken broth on the side. Every plate comes with the three sauces, which are house made ginger scallion sauce, chile sauce, and soy sauce. The dish also includes marinated cucumbers and preserved mustard greens. Overall, it was so delicious and it met my expectations. The hainan chicken was fresh and moist... just perfect. The chicken broth was flavorful and I loved that the portion for everything was just the right amount. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off, their customer service is fantastic.  We were greeted as we walked in and was asked if we have been here before. It was our first time so Liz(if I remember correctly) which was also our server, guided us through the menu and already answered our questions without us asking. Jenny was so friendly and full of joy. I noticed that Jenny and Liz remembers all the people that came in which was awesome.   Now for the food. We ordered the Thai wings 8 pcs which we made 1/2 spicy & regular, Fried Chicken Bao, & Indo Fried Rice. We thought it would not be enough for 3 of us ladies but we were wrong. Every bite triggered our different palates. The sauce on all three dishes were so good. Highly satisfied and highly recommended!   Did I mention their decorations are beautiful?!  From the wall to the table and to the seats. Love it!"}
{"text":"(4.5 stars) Great spot for lunch off the strip. The chicken is crazy good and the prices reasonable (roughly $10 a meal). The side sauces are awesome, especially the red one, and the fried rice is not too miss.   I ended up going with the indo fried rice, which I would totally order again, but only because they were out of the hainan fried rice, which apparently they are known for. The wings are a bit pricey but the honey sriracha ones are worth it. Great crispy exterior, plenty of sauce, and a good bit of kick to them."}
{"text":"coming from LA... everyone knows about Savoy.  after learning about this place and it seems pretty interesting, i decided to give it a try!   everything is organic and homemade here, the sauces, gingers, eggs, even chickens were 'massaged'! the hainan chicken was yum - white meats were so tender, don't need to pay extra for all dark meat! rice was pretty seasoned, fried chicken skin were a little too thick - i did not finish mine and i LOVE chicken skins! i thought the sambal wings were just OK, not so spicy and lack of flavors...  the waitress (or the owner?) was... WAY too attentive... she came over and checked on us for maybe 5 times, explained how everything was prepared... she did the same thing to everyone, so when you are inside a small restaurant, you kinda hear the same thing over and over and over again... yes it's very helpful, i guess if people ask or seem confused on how things are made? the whole thing was seem too excessive.     would i come back? probably not. (well, if i actually live in LV, yes i would definitely will!) i do recommend people who loves hainan chicken to go give this place a try! the congee with poached egg looks interesting too but i did not give it a try...  no bathroom here! they'd ask you to go to the sandwich shop at the next plaza, but it's really not the cleanest place..."}
{"text":"Was brought here by a friend who heard about it from another friend. This might be the best chicken I ever eaten. I ordered the chicken bao on the side and roasted spring chicken. Honestly can't say enough good things. Will be returning whenever I'm in the area before 3pm."}
{"text":"Great small place, good service and moved the line quick. Chicken wings...awwsome ... Buns were soft and very good."}
{"text":"This is such a great place with great people - Sheridan and Jenny are so wonderful and hospitable! The menu is simple, but it's all you need to fulfill your poultry needs. They use Mary's free-range organic chicken for all their dishes. There's either poached chicken, fried chicken tenders, or chicken wings.  Hainan Chicken Rice ($8.99): poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat with pickled cucumbers and mustard greens. Served with housemade soy, ginger scallion, and sambal sauces, and a side of chicken broth. I added a fried egg ($1.99) and Chinese sausage ($1.99). This dish is phenomenal. It's Asian comfort food at its finest. Every element is so wonderful. The chicken, the rice, and especially the housemade sauces. I had to get extra ginger scallion. Yum. I could eat this all the time.  Mrs. Han's Twice-Cooked Szechuan Chicken Wings and Thai Style Chicken Wings: fish sauce, garlic, and lemon (1 pound, $7.99). Both extremely flavorful! Also, just really great wings. You get a cute metal bucket to put your bones.  I'm definitely going back to try the other dishes, but the Hainan Chicken Rice is a must on every visit!"}
{"text":"Poached juicy chicken? Yes please!! I've always been a huge fan of Hainan Chicken Rice and when I found out there was a place off strip that specializes in it, I bookmarked it and flew out to try. Thank goodness for airline perks!  Chicken is organic free range; it's the American version of the chickens that are found in Asia called \"Tu-Gi\" - ground/dirt chickens since they run around all day on dirt.  The chicken was poached perfectly. Juicy. Tender. Melt in my mouth. The rice was soooooo flavorful! Perfectly al dente. I'll be dreaming about this for awhile.   Sauces are all made in house. Dip the chicken in the soy, add a dollop of ginger scallion and do a dab of the sambal sauce. Eat. Repeat.   Broth. Get the broth. Hands down that broth is amazeballs. I wish I could get the broth Fedex-Ed to me next time I get sick. It tasted like hearty yummy chicken.   Cornish hen salad was delicious! Served with half a hen that's fried so that the skin had all sorts of delicious crispy heavenly goodness. It comes with a wedge of lemon and a twist on the classic salt and pepper that included ground Szechuan peppercorns! The salad was chock full of autumn goodies: pomegranate seeds, avocado, julienned persimmons, cucumbers, grapes, cranberries, sunflower seeds, and green mix.   Solid five stars. It is now on my regular Vegas restaurant rotations along with Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"The not so great: Paid street parking, no cash taken unless it's exact change, the hainan chicken was okay but not in the best I've had category but it was in the most expensive hainan chicken I've had category.The Chinese sausage was hard and cut unevenly. The bone soup tasted a little like packet ramen soup base. The veggie spring rolls were crispy but bland. I've had frozen ones that tasted better. I had dried rice stuck to the bottom of my water glass.  They have a spoon and fork on the table set but I think a knife and fork would be better to cut my chicken and help push my rice onto my fork. The good: The burger was delicious. The seasonal veggie side for the chicken was excellent. The server was nice. The fries were okay.  The sauces were excellent.  I travelled from Summerlin to eat here because I heard great things about the restaurant and the chef, but I was soooo disappointed overall. There is a new Hainan chicken place that just opened on Durango and I thought they were better. Also, the deviled eggs are no longer offered. The food is decent but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday. I got the chicken wings half sweet Thai chili, half cilantro. I think it could of had been better for the wings, I wasn't a big fan on them. I also got the combo #1, it was super delicious. I just wish it was a bigger portion for the price. The staff was very friendly, refilled our waters constantly. Place was clean and luckily wasn't busy when I went there. But I would definitely return for that #1 combo!"}
{"text":"First time here. Tried to come 5 or 6 times and either had just missed or they were closed days off. This place is amazing everything was just perfection . I had the traditional Hainen chicken and rice poached egg on rice with Chinese sausage. THE BOMB! Worth every drive over here to find a closed shop. I find poached chicken can end up either bland or rubbery this was not. Truly will share the word thus place is a must try.# new favorite!"}
{"text":"WOW what an incredible eating experience! This place is AMAZING! Great vibe, relaxed atmosphere, excellent service and everything from start to finish had a great balance of flavors and textures! It also turns out that they have live music on Thursday, lucky me.  My dinner experience:  Hot tea: Moonshine  Springrolls w sweet chile sauce  Laska- curry coconut noodle soup, large prawn, tofu puffs, pulled Mary's chicken, 1 hour egg, herbs lime  New York Style Cheesecake w strawberry glaze topping  Le Grand Cocktail - Absolut Elyx, lime, honey, Le Grand Courtage Sparkling Wine, bitters  The best dinner experience I have had in many years. Thank you David for the invitation. Also thank you, Gino for the great service and Adam for making my fabulous cocktail. Thank you all for such a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"THAI CHICKEN WINGS on lock. First time I came they ran out of their specialty chicken dish (but I'll be back so no worries). Even so, the rest of their dishes are worth trying. I had the Thai sweet wings, just YES in my mouth. They give you a selection of house made sauces to eat along with it and it's absolute flavor heaven. Also had the fried rice with an egg, so simple but so delectable (especially when you mix it up with their side sauces...taste bud euphoria). And their Fried Chicken Baos are sandwich freaks of nature, soft yet crispy and the sauce...you can probably tell I'm a sauce person and it met my expectations, sweet yet savory.  I love that their menu is limited, so you know that each dish is excellent. Service was friendly and inviting (server explained the ingredients in detail and was super informative), I even met the chef's wife who is super sweet. The place is small but charming, it also fills up quickly so you may experience a wait but I came around 2ish and was seated pretty quickly. LOVE and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I came because my friend read about it and it got awesome reviews. As a guy who grew up on this stuff I knows a chicken when I sees a chicken. I mean game chickens, farm raised chickens, to black chickens. So this place basically is famous for the Chinese style of chicken where you throw the bird in, the fowl, in bowling water and then pluck it out and stick it in cold water to stop the cooking. You then just eat it with soy sauce and rice basically. For the price and the chicken meat, it's too much. You can get a comparable chicken from a good Chinese restaurant for the same. For $6, I'd stick with Big Wong's for their ho nam chicken. Mo' chicken and same tasty seasoned rice and open majority of the time. Yay Big Wong."}
{"text":"We had Hainanese Chicken Rice with the traditional chicken and also with the fried chicken. The fried chicken was a bit too dry.  The traditional chicken was ok but the rice was tasty. The hot sauce was quite nice but everything else was just satisfactory.  For the price, I find the portion was  on the small side."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I found out that they are related to Fat Choy's and I LOVE Fat Choy's.  In any case, the friends and I finally had a chance to stop by and we glad that we did.  First of all, we were not at all familiar with the location so we got lost but we eventually found it.  There's not a lot of parking so when it gets busy, it can be challenging.  The space is quite small and it's harder for larger groups to sit together since the premise of this place is to order first and then find a seat after.  If you are a larger group, they try to accommodate you and make sure that your group sits together, which is pretty awesome.  The staff is very friendly and service is on point.  They check up on how things are and they make sure that your water is filled and will ask if you want more sauce.    Anyhow, as I stated earlier, you order first and their menu is not at all extensive.  They keep it simple so they can work their magic on the items that they do offer.  Some of my friends opted for the chicken and rice (roasted version as well), chicken wings and the bao.  The chicken bao was massive.  It was a little dry for me but you just add some sauce to it and viola!  It becomes awesome.  The boyfriend got the roasted chicken and rice and he really liked it.  He said that his chicken was not dry at all and he especially loved the rice.  I ordered the hainan chicken and rice.  I agree with the boyfriend and the rice was excellent - it had excellent flavor and it was not salty at all.  Who knew that rice would be so darn good?!?  The chicken was moist and had great flavor but you do need the sauces to make it spectacular (at least that's my preference).  If they don't offer you enough sauce, you can always ask for more.  Overall, I really liked the food here, the service was great and the price point is decent.  I would definitely come back here again because I want to try the other items that they have on their menu."}
{"text":"Limited indoor seating and no outdoor seating available (not that you'd want to in the armpit side of Vegas).  Order first, sit down. Wait for your food.  The ordering line could be quite long since only 1 table is available to process your order and payment.  Staffing & Service: -Extremely nice and attentive staff -1 chef (owner), 2 cashier/server/buser  Menu/Food: - I had the poached chicken salad with an added over easy egg.  Delicious! The salad ingredients were incredibly fresh and interesting.  Due to food allergy, I requested mine without avocado and fresh grapes, but it was still really great tasting and had wonderful textures.  The poached boneless Hainan chicken is legit!  Egg was also well done - Menu has a very small offering but better a well execute small menu than a long list of junk  Location: -Really bad neighborhood -Exiting the parking onto Sahara was difficult.  Watch out for that left turn merger, I almost got hit driver side by a vehicle Exiting onto Industrial and once you merge on Sahara, everyone is driving at 40+mph while you're ramping up to 10mph.    OVERALL: Food was delicious, but the chicken salad with added egg was not filling as a lunch plate.  Another companion in our group had the roasted chicken rice plate, served with one small quarter bone in chicken.  We both ended up getting more food at a nearby restaurant when we left for dessert in Chinatown.  We would visit again but will need to order a 3rd sharing plate to fill 2 adults (both of us are under 150lbs)."}
{"text":"Best single word that describe Flock & Fowl  is consistency.  What a great experience in exceptional preparation of Hainanese Chicken with Rice that has a Vietnamese influence using quality organic product created by Chef Sheridan Su. Superb service and barista execution in a knowledgeable and educated delivery by Jenny Wong. Hainanese Chicken and Rice is the house speciality, A MUST. The House Salad consist of a mixture of bib lettuce and assorted greens, pomegranate, avocado, dried cranberries and ripe tomato silvers coated lightly in a house made dressing, addition of a sunny side up organic fried egg also with slices of chinese sausage  confit is a treat. Thai Chicken Wings are off the chart. The sauce is not spicy but the flavoring with the Thai fish sauce makes for a great flavor profile. Chef's cooking method keeps them wings moist. Bao Bun with Fried Chicken Tenders marinated in butter milk (again) with Chef's spin on the breading along with garnishes.  Chili, Scallion & Ginger and Lite Soy are sauces that of course Chef makes from scratch. With the addition of a cup of Chicken broth is also fun and flavorful. A MUST; Jenny's Iced Vietnamese Coffee \"go large size\".  Best second single word that describe Flock & Fowl is passion."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by Mel C and Terri R so we checked them out. Luckily it was still open when we found it. There was a stall right in front of the restaurant so it was meant to be. We were the last customers of the night when we arrived. Usually the workers are grumpy because they are ready to go home. This was not the case! Everyone was so friendly and so helpful. Customer service here was excellent! That's bonus points points for any restaurant.   Inside is rather dim but sets the mood of the place. It has a modern hipster decor with a great bar area that you pass through when you walk in. We were recommended to try their Son in Law Deviled Eggs so we ordered it. It was delicious! I really enjoyed this appetizer and would recommend it. Nadine ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger because the kitchen recommended it. The fries were really good and the burger meat was freshly ground. It wasn't a bad burger.   I knew what I wanted so I ordered their Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice w/#1 (Poached). When it came out, the presentation was nice and clean. There are three sauces, rice and the chicken bone broth. The egg was perfectly cooked via sous vide. Rice was good and they didn't use too much chicken fat to make it. They had extra chicken bone broth so they gave Nadine and Mink some to try. I loved that it had flavor because a lot of places give you bland broth but it was mutually agreed that it was on the saltier side. Great recommendation and I'm glad we got to check them out!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. Chic ambience compared to the their old cramped location. What kept me coming back was the flavor and quality of the food. Unfortunately the food quality has changed. The same flavors no longer exist and this was the main reason I kept frequenting the old location. Hopefully things will change for the better as they settle in to the new location. On the plus side they have a liquor license. Not sure how the cocktails are."}
{"text":"I love Flock and Fowl! Every dish is intuitive and well prepared which always makes me come back for more. Whether you're a regular or not the service is always friendly and they've never rushed me to take my order. Must try!"}
{"text":"I've been a steady customer of the original location and was excited to try the new location. Food was still good, although seemed a bit pricier. I hope the original location doesn't raise prices to match. Also, music was completely wrong and abrasive - heavy rap did not fit the atmosphere nor contribute to what was otherwise a pleasant experience. I enjoyed seeing some new menu items. I tried the son in law eggs which were tasty. The server was very nice although he did forget our pot of tea, and it took a while for us to finally have an opportunity to drink it - when we were 90% done with our meal. The tea, an oolong, was delicious so I am glad it finally arrived. Overall, I prefer the more flexible pricing options and calming atmosphere/music of the original location."}
{"text":"This place is a serious gem! The original location on Sahara was in an older, run-down building so Jenny & her crew decided to pack things up and show the downtown foodie scene how things are done.   She caters to a very eccentric crowd, many tourists check this off their bucket list as well as many locals dine here regularly because the atmosphere makes you feel at home. It honestly feels like you're at your best friends dinner table & her mom keeps checking on you ensuring your needs are met. Jenny, the owner, did an amazing job presenting such fine cuisine in the heart of downtown.   She introduced herself to every table & made sure everyone was pleased with their experience. Yes, experience because that's what it is. This unexpected lunch turned into a very excellent dining experience. We learned so much about the culture and backstory of this ma&pa joint!  The food! TO. DIE. FOR. seriously, come in on the weekend for a nice brunch. They have a killer French toast with berries.   I was a frequent visitor of the Sahara location, so the Hainanese chicken is my favorite dish. I ordered that today with the poached egg & Chinese sausage. It was so good, but my daughter French toast was far more appetizing. The only downfall was $11 for a cocktail that tasted like mostly mango purée. Not even a slight kick, but it was still a great dining experience.   I'm so happy for stopping in and learning more about this small business."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small, foods not great, bad service, not happy at all. Ruined my lunch. Gave my table to other people that came in 15 min after I came in. Never again. They suck."}
{"text":"Parking is tough here so just park in a lot and walk over. We had the Hainanese Chicken steamed and fried (unusual so we had to try it) and it was delish. The only thing I think the dish was missing was the green onion oil on the rice. The sauces were spot on minus the soy sauce. I am used to a salty sweet soy with my Hainan Chickens so this is why I am singling it out. We picked the 1 hour egg (which has a custard consistency) and Chinese sausage. I recommend cracking that egg over your rice and a few drops of the soy sauce that comes with your chicken on it...amazing! They had a pop-up menu and I got to try the pancit and cheese (think Mac and Cheese). It was soooo good. I never thought the two would go together but it did. The panko-cheese crisps on top was the best. The service here is great and the staff is friendly and took care of us."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've been to Flock & Fowl on numerous occasions and have always been very satisfied.  The food is consistently good and they have some stellar cocktails as well.  I'm partial to the Mezcal Milk Tea myself with a Notorious P.I.G. chaser and a side of Pine N' Dandy.  Can't go wrong with that combo.  I'm a yuge fan of the salt and pepper wings.  Yuge.  No matter what else is being ordered I always get an order of those wings.  The chicken rice is fantastic.  The flavor and texture on the rice is out of this world and the bone broth, the bone broth is sublime.  Extremely flavorful and creamy and everything you'd want in a broth.  Truly satisfying.  The Kaya toast is, with or without the foie, a real treat.  I'm not a big fan of sweet flavors, but the kaya toast has a savory element to it as well with the egg, soy and foie that works really well.  This is definitely a staple for me when I go in.  The staff is always warm and friendly and the place has a great vibe to it.  If you haven't been yet I'd highly recommend and if you have been then you know what I'm talking about.  It's been in regular rotation for me since the day it opened."}
{"text":"Amazing food as well as friendly and kind staff. I recommend the house salad especially if you have been eating a ton of crap on holiday and need/want something deliciously light and nutritious...yum!"}
{"text":"Small chicken rice shop on Sahara. It is Hainan style chicken rice, they are using Mary Free Ranch Chicken. Menu is simple with Hainan chicken, buttermilk fried chicken and roasted chicken. They also has chicken wings, katsu chicken Bao. Indonesian fried rice consists of chicken, Chinese sausage, bacon, curry flavor with 63 degree poached egg.  The Hainan chicken rice is good, it is $9.99, you can add topping such as fried egg, Lapchong, fried chicken skin or Bok Choy for $1.99 each.  Great place for quick lunch. Ordered at the counter then pick your tables, servers will bring foods to your table."}
{"text":"Overall, a four-star restaurant in the aspects of food, service, and environment.   I'm a huge fan of pork belly buns and hainan chicken rice. I was definitely grateful when chef Su opened up FatChoy five years ago and then followed by Flock and Fowl on Sahara. I think all three locations are all very unique and definitely worth local's attention.   With the newest Flock and Fowl in Ogden under his portfolio, I'm intrigued to see what will be next. Flock and Fowl in downtown has more upscale and trendy vibes compared to the other two business. I was surprised to see how spacious it was compared to Flock and Fowl on Sahara.   The service was decent during our visit. Nothing more or less to notate for.   Onto the food items that we've tried.   1. Son in law \"Deviled Eggs\" (5/5): not your traditional deviled eggs. They are much better! It was fried along with tamarind sauce and fried shallot. Definitely getting this again.   2. Broccoli and Quinoa Salad (4/5): it was light and fresh. Not the best Quinoa I've had but I enjoyed it with fried tofu.   3. Laksa noodle (3/5): I like lasksa curry a lot. You don't find this dish easily. I was excited to try chef Su's version. It wasn't what I was expected. The sauce for the noodle was great for maybe like dipping type of noodle instead of noodle soup. It was too thick to drink the broth. Also the tofu puffs was soaked in the soup too long that it did not even taste like fried tofu.   4. Hainan Chicken Rice (5/5): I've been to several Hainan chicken places including Savoy and Nong's Khal Man Gao and some other places. Savoy and flock and fowl are still two of my favorites. They each have their own mastery on either sauce, rice or chicken. I'm glad this dish tasted the same as the one in Sahara location. You can taste the quality of their chicken. The only difference between two locations is that in DTLV location, the dish came with two sides and priced higher at $14.99. In Sahara location, you can just get naked Hainan chicken for $9.99 and add on additional sides for $1.99 each. It is essentially the same price but a dollar more than Sahara location. I think it is fairly priced considering the setup compared to Sahara. I also like the sauce even more now compared to when they first opened Sahara location.   5. The cookie (1/5): I wouldn't order it again. It was overly sweet like I'm going to get a cavity after eating that lol. Didn't think dessert would be the focus here anyway. Hopefully they can design a more Asian fusion dessert menu in the future.   In all, I highly suggest all locals to check out this place or the one on Sahara if you are a Hainan Chicken Rice fan. However, if you are one of those eaters who enjoy your free range chicken that runs 10 miles a day in results of tighten and tough breast, this is not the place for you. I enjoy my chicken on the tender side and Flocks and Fowl is perfect for me."}
{"text":"Rating is only a 3 has I have been to Singaporean and had the good stuff. Very nice small hip restaurant. Overall food was good just a little pricey for chicken and rice. One weird thing is they don't have a restroom and made the customers that ask go to another restaurant to use."}
{"text":"Today's choice was their Chicken Bao. Chicken was marinated overnight in buttermilk and was fried to a golden brown and crisp exterior and juicy interior. Whether it's their Hainan Chicken or Cornish Game Hen, they never disappoint. (I swear I will eventually try their salads but I'm not a salad person haha)  Practically whenever I get a day off this place is a staple for me. The drive is worth it everytime. Never disappointed and the owner remembers my name! Can't go wrong with a place like that."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and we love it just like our first time. Their chicken dish, so so tender. If u want a little kick with the crunch taste, try the roasted, the seasons go THROUGH skin, meat, and bones. The rice, so well reasoned that u wouldn't need any sauce. But lets talk about sauces, it's between the bomb.com and dietoeat.net lol. Customer service is wonderful, I wish they have one back home. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I was craving some Hainan Chicken and visited the top two spots in Vegas: Big Wong's and Flock and Fowl. So which is better? Flock and Fowl wins on most criteria but in terms of holy grail, the best Hainan Chicken I've ever had was at Rooster and Rice in SF.  Pro-tip: Flock and Fowl is on UberEats,   =====Flock and Fowl vs. Big Wong's===== * Chicken: Flock and Fowl! More flavorful and slightly more tender at F&F * Rice: Both were decently good, I think I favored Flock. * Value: Big Wong's - only $5 for a plate and you get more chicken! * Sauce: The dipping sauces are better at Flock and Fowl, but I've had better.  =====Other Dishes===== * Fried Chicken Wings - 3.5 stars: Thai chili was FAR better than the Honey Sriracha. The Sriracha had a weird flavor and was too sweet. I liked how big and crunchy they were. * Oolong Milk Tea - 2.5 stars: Tasted very homemade in a way I didn't enjoy.... Would not order again. * Broth - 2 stars: Scalding hot, too oily, not flavorful enough. Only 99 cents for a cup! * Fried Chicken Entree - 3 stars: Pretty standard, best part was the rice."}
{"text":"If I ever made a list of the best things I've ever eaten, the hainan chicken rice at Flock and Fowl would be at the top of that list.   The staff here are fantastic. They take the time to ask if it's your first time at the restaurant. If it is, they'll take a moment and go through their main menu items.  The food deliver speed was incredible, I think it took 5 minutes for my chicken rice to arrive!  The chicken rice was made with some sort of broth/fat, making it absolutely delicious. Their chicken was a mixture of both white and dark meat, creating a juicy balance.  I remember telling my friend during the meal that I was already looking forward to my next visit - yea it's THAT good.  If you're looking to visit Flock and Fowl, be sure to check their operating hours. I think it's Tues-Sat lunch only."}
{"text":"Love this hole in the wall place! The restaurant is located in an odd shopping strip so we actually had to loop around twice before arriving. The restaurant is small and have limited seatings. I can't imagine the seating situation during peak hours. But since it was only my boyfriend and I, we had no issues.   The menu was quite simple with limited number of items. I prefer menus that way because that meant the restaurant must specialize in those items they serve. They have poached chicken which is a common technique Asians cook their chicken. So I order that with salad. My boyfriend ordered with the broken rice instead. The broken rice came with egg and other pickled vegetables. The amount of chicken they give you was a good portion and I felt full afterwards. The meat was juicy and tender as well.   Overall, I was quite happy with my meal and service. If you want to take a break from the strip, come check out this place!"}
{"text":"After going to the bun shop in Korea town la I tried to find somewhere here in town that had bao bun tacos. I was disappointed. I expected to be somewhere close to the bun shop but I was wrong. Had 2 different wanted cups which I found nats in both. The fried rice was average at best and it seemed a little over priced."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Flock & Fowl. I love this place! It's small, locally owned, and uses very high quality ingredients.  I wanted to write in particular about yesterday's Sesame Noodles special. From what I was told, some people who ordered the dish were disappointed, but I'm guessing that that was because they didn't know what to expect.  Years ago, when I lived in New York City, cold sesame noodles were a staple Chinese takeout dish--a dish that was sometimes heavy, somewhat greasy, always addictive. Flock & Fowl's version was exactly what I had hoped for on a July afternoon when our car thermometer was reading 120 degrees--a light, healthy, equally addictive take on the cold sesame noodles I remember.  Flock & Fowl served up slivered carrots and cucumber, cold noodles, and warm poached chicken pieces arrayed on a plate with the sesame sauce on the side. This allowed me to mix the ingredients myself, adding as much of the wonderful sesame sauce as I wanted. I happily took the server up on her offer of extra sauce, since it seemed quite healthful (delicately delicious rather than pasty thick). The flavors melded together beautifully, and the nuanced result was yummy.  The cold sesame noodles weren't at all spicy, which brings me to the other reason I wanted to write a second review. The food at Flock & Fowl is made to order, and the staff is very accommodating, so if you have specific expectations, you should definitely speak up. I'm sure I could have asked for the cold sesame noodles to have some kick to them, and I think that's probably true for a lot of the dishes. My sense is that Flock & Fowl leans toward extremely well executed, subtly (in a good way) flavored dishes that appeal to a wide range of palates, but I'm guessing that they will happily try to fulfill requests regarding individual tastes as long as they know about them."}
{"text":"This place serves unbelievable Hainin chicken rice and chicken wings.  I got both when I went.  The chicken rice matches perfectly cooked and deboned chicken (no taking shards out of your mouth) with fantastically seasoned rice.  It came with 3 dipping sauces.  All of the sauces would be fine just served with the seasoned rice but they took the chicken to another level.  Everyone just devoured our plates.  Chicken wings might be even better.  I don't know what they put in the sauce but it was out of this world and the wings are slightly crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I'm really shocked we have such a good Hainan chicken place here in Las Vegas.  No one else serves a halfway decent version of it.  And this is better than anything I've had in Taiwan and Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I just went there with my husband and mom. They only open 5 hours a day. Their Chicken rice is soooo good , chicken soft and juicy and the rice is awesome ."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and I must warn you...don't come with large parties.  During their lunch time rush, because the place is so so small, the biggest party they can really accommodate is 4-6 with a wait.  They would have to squeeze three tables together so you can imagine the wait.  You also cannot take a seat unless your whole party is here.  Oh and another thing, if you don't have 2 hours for lunch (wait for table and wait for food), I would suggest going elsewhere as food is also slow to come out because of the small kitchen.  Other than that, I really did enjoy my hainan chicken.  I ordered it with veggies of the day which was bok choy.  I thought for the price of the add on, the portion was extremely small.  I wouldn't order it next time.  The chicken comes with 3 delicious sauce.  My favorite was the ginger, I had to ask for more of that.  The sauces really make this dish!  The warm garlic rice paired really well with the tender soft chicken meat.  I could eat bowls of that rice.    We also tried the fried chicken buns.  It's not my favorite because I found it really dry.  It was breast meat and I would have preferred thigh meat which is juicer.  The momofuku one is wayyy better although way more expensive as well.    This place is known for its hainan chicken so I'll stick to ordering just that."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to go to lunch at Flock & Fowl on a Tuesday based on its positive Yelp reviews.  Located in the old Itsy Bitsy Ramen space in the Ogden, the restaurant from a purely aesthetic feel seemed little changed from its previous tenant.  I liked Itsy Bitsy a lot, however, from a food and drink perspective, Flock and Fowl was definite step up for downtown.    I started off with a cocktail while I looked over the menu.  I had a Notorious P.I.G. ($16) made with Whistle Pig 10-year Rye, barrel-aged maple syrup, lemon, and served up in a coupe rimmed with Applewood-smoked sea salt.  While it was on the pricey end of cocktails to be found downtown, it was clearly reflective of its choice of base spirit, Whistle Pig, and I felt still a reasonable value for what I received.  It was a very tasty cocktail.  For my food, I had their signature Hainanese Chicken Rice ($14.99).  It came with two sides.  Our personable server made the sage recommendation that I should go with the 1-hour egg and chicken bone broth.  He wasn't wrong.  The dish was simple in concept, hearty, generous portions, and delicious.  The slow-poached egg offered up a nice yolky goodness to the rice, which nicely complemented the moist, flavorful chicken.  Until I had Flock & Fowl's chicken bone broth, I never understood the whole bone broth trend, which seemed to just be bland, bone-infused water, devoid of any flavor.  Flock & Fowl's had flavor, actually tons of flavor, which was unmistakably chicken.  It was perfectly seasoned and surprisingly hearty even though it was only a broth.    All in all, it was a very satisfying experience on all counts, food, drink, and service.  I can see why the locals seem to love both it and the original Flock & Fowl location.  It was definitely worth getting away from the Strip to try something new and different.  I hope this place has staying power in the Ogden because I definitely want to come back for more the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My friends and I were originally going to try the original location on Sahara but since it was closed, we went to the DTLV one instead. We arrived at around 7 on a Friday night and it didn't seem packed at all. The bar area is near the front of the entrance with additional seating as you continue to walk back. Our party of 3 all ordered the Hainanese chicken rice - 1 traditional, 2 fried. I was pretty satisfied with how my traditional chicken turned out since I'm a big fan of Hainan chicken. The rice could use a little more chicken broth but the bone broth it came with was super flavorful and soothing. They did not have dark meat but the chicken did come with skin so yay! Really tender and juicy. Interesting how I was able to order Chinese sausage with it as well. My friends preferred my dish over theirs since the fried chicken made the meat a little dry and without the sauces, the pieces were just bland. The staff was attentive and friendly, hence the 4 stars, but for the food, even though I did like it, it cannot be compared to the good eats in my hometown."}
{"text":"I ended up here (the new DT location) because yelp said Singaporean and I've never tried this kind of food so I decided to give it a shot. I had no expectations. I ordered a toast appetizer thing and the broccoli and quinoa salad. Both were absolutely amazing. You'd think broccoli and quinoa salad would sound bland and boring but it was the exact opposite. The toast (I included a picture) was nicely presented.   My friend got the deviled eggs, which were also delicious, and the renown chicken rice dish. The bartender was really good at explaining every dish we had questions about and served us promptly and efficiently. The prices are good for the quality of the food. I would definitely come back!  The only thing is that they don't have much vegetarian options, let alone vegan."}
{"text":"Typed in Singaporean in yelp and found this gem. Great hainan chicken rice with Chinese sausage. Service was great and conveniently located near the famous Fremont Street where I like to gamble since the strip odds suck now  Unfortunately they didn't have Tiger beer or an ice Kopi Teh to wash it down.   Til I eat you again la"}
{"text":"I like this lovely small restaurant even tho they don't have the restroom for the customers.  We came here for the hai nan chicken rice. It's a little different than the ones I normally have. All the chicken was boneless.  The meat was pretty tender.  The taste was a little lighter than others but it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"This place does not have very authentic Singaporean food. My girlfriend and I were expecting it to be more authentic but it wasn't and that was okay, we still wanted to give it a try. Food presentation was very good, they definitely want you go get in those instagram good moments. The service was also very nice, very professional. But be warned it is a little on pricey side. We spent over $50 for two meals and a cookie. Give it a shot if you're interested. Metered parking out side usually has spaces available."}
{"text":"I really do like this place a lot.  The chicken is quite good and even though I have ONE \"go to\" dish on the menu I always get (the hainan chicken #1), it's the MAIN reason I come here.  Nowhere else in Vegas has a decent Hainan chicken dish and the only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I've eaten 5 star Hainan chicken before and I am VERY PICKY about my Hainan chicken."}
{"text":"Worth going to for lunch. Sometimes service is a bit shoddy, but the food is delicious. They only basically serve one thing though so you have to be in the mood for chicken and rice, chinese style. This is one of the many lunch spots that I occasionally go to. Food comes out fairly quickly but sometimes the wait for a seat is a bit long if you walk in after the lunch crowd gets there. Nice decorations and ambiance though, definitely has a hipster somewhere doing their interior design."}
{"text":"After hearing a few friends rave about Flock & Fowl we finally made it a point to check it out during our last trip to Vegas for CNY.    Originally we were hoping to dine at the location next to the Lucky Dragon hotel, but we quickly discovered this location was temporarily closed. Luckily, the location in dtlv was open and headed there on Saturday for lunch. Drawback with this place is that there's only limited free parking and metered street and lots. IIRC an hour on the street was $2 vs. $3 inside the lot. Do watch the time as there were meter maids cruising around in bikes.  Arrived to a packed restaurant and were told that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes for a table (our party had 5). We ended up only waiting 15 minutes for our table which wasn't bad. Seemed as if we just had bad timing. We ended up ordering a laksa, kaya toast, poached hainan chicken rice, fried chicken and the roasted game hen. Next we opted for Chinese sausages, fried egg, veggies, and their soft boiled egg. The most important part of dish is the rice for me. Though the flavor of the rice was more fragrant than Savoy, it just doesn't compare to what one would find in Singapore or even up here at cluck2go in Pasadena. Out of all the different varieties of chicken, I thought the roasted cornish game hen was the most moist and flavorful. Second best would have been the fried chicken and lastly the poached. However, one can definitely taste the quality of chicken used here. The most disappointing part of the meal was when I requested more ginger sauce. What was brought out looked like a greenish-yellow phlegm that one would cough up when you have the flu. It looked like nothing what we initially had. I wish I took a pic of the sauce.   The laksa was decent but thought it a lacked flavor but that could be due to design. An authentic laksa in Singapore may be too strong for American taste buds and most would find too fishy. The kaya toast was ok but once again wasn't very authentic.   Wasn't a memorable meal and definitely didn't live up to the expectations I had.  Loved the decor and the waiters were friendly. Not sure I would go out of my way to dine here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food Loved loved the egg drop soup (Fantastic)their special red sauce is so yummy that it's addictive. I had to buy a container of it to Go. Troy the server is great he definitely aims to serve how refreshing. Had their specialty the chicken fried rice which has organic Mary's chicken. In addition had their farmers market salad that had every veggie imaginable imagine the veggie kitchen sink. My favorite was the celery root cut into slivers. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place with some friends, and can I say it was a nightmare. Upon arrival you have to wait at least 30+ minutes depending on the day. There about 4 tables literally. There was no air conditioning or at least it seemed really hot inside. The don't provide menus and you are required to look behind you at the wall or on a dry erase board which is really small on the floor. Additionally you have to get up and stand in line to order your food and it's really uncomfortable because someone's table might be right behind you. On top of that, they don't provide real silverware, you're forced to eat from plastic spoons and forks. The food is really tasty but the environment and experience is unconventional, unpractical and really uncomfortable. My 2 stars were given just because the food was good. I'll never go here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll have to post a disclaimer by saying that I realize afterwards that I should have ordered off their regular menu since that's what they're known for and not their specials. Nevertheless I'd read a review by someone else on their Indo Fried Rice special and thought it sounded good- Chinese sausage, chicken and bacon folded into soy fried rice with one of their \"perfect\" poached eggs\". It was \"okay\". I didn't care to finish it. Their claim to \"Indo\" (Indonesian) rice I think was met by a judicious use of Indonesian sweet soy sauce, but that's where similarities ended. The Chinese sausage was nice, but there were very few and skimpy shreds of chicken and much of the bacon stir-fried in was still chewy as opposed to crisp. What WAS crispy that I could taste was lot of garlic that was fried to the point of almost-bitter. The egg was \"okay\". I love poached eggs and runny yolks, but a lot of the egg white was also quite runny and well, snot-like (horrible sounding, I know, but accurate). Portion size was great if you wanted lots of rice. Chrysanthemum tea was really pleasant, just strong enough and very freshly-brewed tasting but I admit I did a small double take at the total charge coming to close to $18 (with tax) for what I'd gotten. Overall, I think I'll be back just to try their Hainan chicken rice (main menu)  as it's close by and one of the VERY few Singaporean - influenced restaurants in the city but my general feeling was spend on that (and skip the Indo Rice)."}
{"text":"This place deserves a great review. They had me at Organic Free Ranged Chicken   I've been meaning to come in here myself since their soft opening weeks ago but haven't had the chance to with my littlest one before they close at 3:30pm so had my hubby pick it up for lunch today 10/7/15  Hainan Chicken is Amazeballs like I knew it would be. The chicken itself is super moist with a silky buttery like skin that just melts in your mouth. Literally. The best part is that it's already DEBONED for you too!! No place I've ever been to debones their chicken and that's the worst part too lol      Comes with 3 different sauces     -Tangy spicy chili - perfect touch of heat     -Ginger Scallion - good ..bit more salt or seasoning would make it perfect (I'm a salty eater lol)     -Sweet Soy - Nice thick sweeter kind of dip Eat these all together and you have a perfect bite   Chicken flavored Rice that comes with the hainan chicken is perfect the way it is with the yummy chicken flavor   Twice Fried Chicken Wings were good. That ooey gooey sweet stickey sauce is fingerlicking good. Not too overly sweet either  I will definitely be back again personally soon. Need to take pictures of the interior myself and eat some more yummy organic chicken haha"}
{"text":"Ready for a clucking good taste of Singapore?  Chicken rice, the national dish of Singapore and since 2015, in their tiny eatery on Sahara, they did it up right proper.  Fast forward to today, in their industrial digs in DTLV, same great heavenly pok pok.  Can you tell I've been a longtime fan?  Note:  This isn't social dining like other DTLV hot spots.  With few exceptions, dishes are NOT meant to be shared.   The chicken, free range, organic and chickeny as it should be.  Poached in a mother stock of chickeny goodness, it's uber tender flesh is sliced and served along side a pile of rice cooked in the thick, fatty, collagen charged poaching liquid.  A brooding, earthy, slightly sweet dark soy and bright, spicy sambal, the traditional and perfect accompaniments.  Be sure to get the one broth as a side.  Basically the cooking liquid to complete the authentic dish.  Chickeny goodness piled atop chickeny infused goodness, served with side of liquid chickeny goodness; get the picture?    Note:  The dish can be ordered with either a fried or roasted chicken.  sampled from fellow diner's plates but it won't beat the traditional.  Sadly the other two Singapore dishes pale in comparison and lack authenticity.  The laksa is missing many of the herbs (laksa leaves, galangal) usually associated with the soup.  Noodles are UNDERCOOKED, al dente when they should be extremely soft and yielding, and there is too much \"stuff\" that result in competing flavors.  Fried tofu, shrimp, micro greens, chicken, egg.  The kaya toast; I won't bother.  So incorrectly made, just skip this.  If available, the chicken skin is a must.  Deep fried, aggressively seasoned, the perfect cracker.  Service is local friendly and efficient.  OK craft cocktail program and short but well selected list of beers all fairly priced.  It remains a one trick pony but hey, who cares when it pulls off that trick masterfully."}
{"text":"A near perfect taste of Singapore's national dish for under $9 (Hawaii yeeps add $600 supplement and 5.5hrs of flying).  That's a savings of $13,700 (hey, if you're going to Singapore, you gotta fly Suite Class right?)  Simply put, this is an authentic, closest tasting Hainanese chicken rice to the hawker stands of Singapore.  Boneless, tender, moist, not fatty pieces of chicken with a very pronounced chickeny flavor served with rice cooked in a rich chicken stock.  Add a whatever portion of dark soy, grated ginger and scallion oil, and fiery chili sauce before spooning the entire bite into your eagerly awaiting mouth.  Then, wow.   Being so chickeny is helped along by the chicken is free range and cooked in a mother stock that is perpetually maintained (based on how this chicken taste, this is definitely the case).  Four other items round out the menu, all chicken of course.  The \"Hainan Fried Chicken Rice\", good.  Moist, breaded, deep fried chicken tenders.  What's not to love.  The \"Night Market Fried Chicken Bao\", the same deep fried chicken in a bun (Chinese not hamburger), with hoisin, sesame seeds, and greens makes a nice starter but nothing compares to the chicken.  As others have mentioned, this is a very small restaurant.  Go at opening or expect a wait.  Service is mom and pop, family friendly.  Vegas rocks out yet another serious Asian food find."}
{"text":"Their highly touted hainan chicken rice lives up to the hype.  However, the rest of the menu is just ok.  You should stick with their chicken rice.  First of all, the chicken rice is very tender and the rice soaks up the flavor, this is a top notch dish and worth the wait.  Their ginger dipping sauce hits the spot.  The only complaint is that the portion is small, like a larger appetizer, so don't come hungry.  Perhaps an extra chicken add on for a few more dollars?  The fried chicken tenders was a little disappointing.  The outside was nice and crispy, the inside was very moist.  The only problem is that it's way too salty and dipping into the provided sauces makes this worse.  The biggest disappointment is the jook or chicken congee.  This is not done the traditional way, the texture was off, the bean sprouts and pickled veggies just didn't work. Why don't they use a traditional recipe and use their high quality chicken and this certainly would be a big hit?  Note that the restaurant is hard to find and not in good neighborhood, going here only for lunch is high advisable.  When on Sahara, look for Tam street, it's in the small strip mall.  Also, it's a really small space, so only a few tables are available."}
{"text":"Thank You Flock & Fowl I never knew chicken can taste this delicious, it's the best I have eaten in Las Vegas!!!  It was deceiving at first, a quaint restaurant with what looked like simple chicken & rice dishes not a whole lot choose from.  I thought to myself \"what's their deal, am I at the right place?\"  As I sat down and had my first bite of the chicken that's when my world flipped over.  Roasted Spring Chicken with rice - The best part of the chicken is that its so tender and juicy. I didn't have to use a fork, simply broke the chicken apart by hand. The flavors was intense but not complicated, seasoned with garlic, ginger and other spices.  They provided me a side of dipping sauces and a lemon to further enhance my taste buds. Even the rice was cooked evenly, cooked with the chicken stock. Simply Amazing!!  The Chicken Katsu 2.0  It's pickled Jalapeno tenders with Egg and cabbage. I don't see this on menu very often, so by chance if you see it order it!! If there is national bucket list for sandwiches, this must be on the list. The chicken katsu was crunchy and salty, while the chicken inside stays moist and full of flavor. The egg and cabbage mixture created the creaminess necessary to bind everything together.   With great food comes a great staff. Every time I go I'm always warmly greeted and received awesome service.  Liz and Jenny are exceptional, knowledgeable and passionate about the food they serve.   Flock & Fowl should definitely be top of the list for anyone who loves chicken."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype here and the 4 1/2 star rating. I ate here yesterday and had the roasted chicken and fried rice. The chicken had good flavor but for $10.81 for a quarter chicken and white rice I think that is crazy but if people are willing to pay that on a consistent basis no need for them to lower their prices. NOT FOR ME. The Fried rice was not good at all. Strange smell and didn't like the flavor at all. Also, this dish was $14.06 which was a total joke. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the 2 girls that worked the counter were total sweethearts and very pleasant. If this place gets the business and gets those prices God bless them but they will not see me again."}
{"text":"Really loved this spot. My girlfriend and I had chicken baos, chicken wings, and the hainan chicken. Guess I like chicken !   I can't speak to the cooking technique, but I could taste the high level of attention to detail. Made me happy. I'm from Texas, but if I'm back in Vegas again I'll be sure to grab lunch here."}
{"text":"When I heard that Flock and Fowl moved from its small location on Sahara to Downtown, I immediately added it to my list.  I finally got around to having a meal there today.  This place is infamous in Las Vegas.  Known for simple, flavorful Asian cuisine.  Its a small menu with free range chicken, super-fresh veggies (local, Farmers market) and a chill atmosphere.  The new space is awesome.  Casual, relaxed yet upscale-feeling.  The bar is fully stocked and the location is easy access from Fremont for visitors.  My Haianese chicken was amazing.  Simple, flavorful, perfect.  I started with a bao that was also delicious.  A special shout-out to Liz at the bar.  She made me feel very welcome and educated me about the menu.  I'm a local and will definitely be back at F&F very soon!"}
{"text":"Newish venue much bigger than the original. Really nice welcome by a friendly hostess who explained the menu while we waited. Really nice food and interesting menu items at a reasonable price. No problem to change the way you want your chicken cooked and served if steamed isn't your thing. I would definitely go back when in vegas"}
{"text":"Taking a quick stroll downtown can give many great dining options, but one would argue a better find, flavor and value found throughout Flock & Fowl's condensed and well executed menu if poultry is the craving.  Just steps away from Fremont Street inside the Ogden Condo High Rise, parking options are fair, with free curb parking a short walk away if you look a bit further out.  A couple outstanding notes to mention :  Start off with the Flock Frites (6.99): Curly Fries, Parmesan,Truffle Schmaltz Mayo & Herbs. EXCELLENT truffle aioli. Very fragrant and refreshing with a ranch-like consistency....the sauce was the highlight of the meal for me!! I could seriously pour it on anything and everything....you'll want to do the same!  Since the menu is Poultry forward, I will suggest the chicken items most enjoyed :  Flock on Flock Chicken Sando ($13.99): Buttermilk Fried Chicken Thigh, Egg Salad Aioli, Preserved Mustard Greens, Cabbage on Local Bread. Juicy chicken, great sandwich!  Signature Hainanese Chicken Rice: Mary's Free Range Chicken, Roasted Cornish Hen, Fried Chicken Thigh, Fried Chicken Skins, Chicken Fat Rice w/ Organic Fried Egg. Excellent feast to try a bit of everything served here, executed perfectly. We also tried the Boiled Chicken here, much better than the average Chinatown rendition.  Curry Laksa ($16.99): Curry Coconut Noodle Soup, Large Prawn, Tofu Puffs, Pulled Mary's Chicken, 1 Hour Egg, Herbs & Lime. Light curry, coming together nicely with the herbs and citrus, good portion.  And don't forget to try a side of the Chicken Bone Broth!! So flavorful, rich soup that you will want to drink straight out of the cup!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this small & quaint restaurant. It was beyond my expectations. Small menu which I liked. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the Roasted Chicken Salad. All ingredients were fresh. I also loved that ingredients were organic. Very clean, friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. Though they had a limited menu, I knew a couple of secret things I could order. Surprised this newcomer knew, he threw a Lil surprise on my burger... a fried egg.  Again, I don't drink, so I ordered my usual Arnold Palmer. He explains he only has a blood orange lemonade... well, twist my arm. He served it in a cute Lil cocktail glass, which he quickly had to refill. What!? It's a desert out there!   My burger came out. It towered over the plate. The smell of truffles filled the air, from my fries. And I had a Lil truffle aoili for dipping. The entire meal was amazingly decadent, but then again it had seared foie gras to boot. The only place where they missed the mark is that the bun wasn't toasted. It would've added a bit more texture to the bite and reactivated the aromatics of warm bread."}
{"text":"The service great and so was the food. Also since it's off the main road it's not too crowded or crazy!  Also they have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"Wow I didn't know chicken and rice could be so tasty!  I would eat here over a Vegas buffet any day.  Food: Ordered hainain chicken with rice and Chinese sausage. The chicken is super moist.  I didn't know plain chicken could taste so good.  Comes with three dipping sauces which are all good. And the rice OMG. It is probably cooked in butter but it is so good. Got a side of bok Choy and that was even tasty.   Also got the fried chicken bun thing.  This was also good, the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist in the inside.  But I definitely recommend getting the classic hainain chicken when you go.  You can order extra/sides with it.  Ambiance: small, got crowded around noon.  Slightly hispterish. The menu is kind of confusing and is like a picture frame on the wall that one of the workers explain.   If you're driving to Vegas or on your way home stop here!"}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Malaysia and Singapore, Flock and Fowl shined well in their efforts to make a local favorite dish.  The chicken was moist and tender,  rice flavorful and the sauces on point. Very impressed.  There's a slight twist to the local style.  Fried egg,  Chinese sausage,  pickled mustard... Different but good!  Jenny the owner was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"For those of you who've been to Singapore or lived there, you can now have a sigh of relief.  The search has ended.   Flock and Fowl is as good as it gets.  You don't understand how much I miss Singapore,  I miss the food there more than I miss my friends there.  I am the type of person that will fly halfway across the world for their favorite food.  And i did just that when it come to Hainan chicken over rice.   This place is legit.  The owner is even in Singapore right now taking lessons on how to improve, not that they need to.  This place can be hard to find if you miss your exit, so don't MISS IT!    I walked into the cafe on a weekday and was shock to see how packed it was.  There was one table left which is great cause i got really lucky.  You have to place your order in the front and then take a seat.  The Owner Jenny will greet you with a smile and provides attentive service.  I got the Hainan Chicken over rice.  It came out pretty fast! The presentation was nice and it came with 3 sauces.  The sauces include the ginger, sweet soy and chili sauce, all which was made in house. I added an egg to mine, was was on top of the special rice.     The way I normally rate Hainan chicken,  comes down to the rice and the way the skin is attached to the chicken.  In this case, it met all my standards.  The chicken was boneless and the skin came off easily.  The chicken was not dry and perfectly moist.  The rice was just want i wanted.  It was flavored well and wasn't too oily!   Just completely perfect!  I have to say I like this place more than Savory in SoCal.  When i found out this place opened, i seriously convinced my friend to fly out to Vegas just to try it when we got off the plane.   Of course, it's cheaper than flying to Singapore.  I was so tempted to buy one togo to bring it bak to the bay but they don't open on Sunday. Oh the heartbreak!!  If the owners are reading this, I ask you to please open one in San Francisco! I beg of you!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a Flock & Fowl fan! This place is a real gem especially since we don't have a lot of Singapore/Malay inspired restaurants in Vegas. The food atmosphere is great and what friendly and knowledgeable staff.   I showed up first before my wife so I got started with the chicken wings as an appetizer. I had both the salt and pepper as well as angry sauce. The batter on the wings was fresh and amazing, perfectly tender. The salt and pepper wings however could use just a tad more salt. Keep in mind I tend to have a bolder pallet when it comes to wings. I also think they could scale back with the sauce on the angry wings. When my wife arrived we had the Laksa which is very similar to a Northern Thai style Kao Soi. That was delicious but not the best I've had.      When I asked the waiter what their signature dish was he recommended the Hainanese Chicken Rice. This is where they should get 5 stars. It was the most authentic and delicious dish I've had in years. Both my wife and I have been to Malaysia and Singapore and this dish brought us both back to those tastes. If you visit Flock & Fowl YOU HAVE TO TRY THE HAINANESE CHICKEN RICE! 5 STARS.."}
{"text":"Very delicious Asian-fusion food off the strip. Nice, hipsterish place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food Presentation Spectacular, but flavors didn't live up to the hype. Chicken wings were on steroids, huge with too much flour, too crusty.  Special#1 was ok but chinese sweet sausage was too salty. Toast was best of what we ordered, but probably best served as a dessert.  We'll give it another shot once they work out the kinks. This location just opened 4-5 months ago."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The Portions are kind of small though. I am little but I eat a lot. They're only open for lunch. Really close to my office so it's a great workday lunch option. My favorite is the Flock & Fowl Salad w/ roasted chicken."}
{"text":"Great servers and ambience. The ginger scallion sauce paired so well with the chicken. The salad had lots of different stuff including some herb I think that kinda numbed our tongues. It was interesting. Got an extra rice. Good quantity. Got the bowl of broth. It was huge! Unfortunately it was a bit on salty side for us. Got the large chrysanthemum tea with a squeeze of lemon and a hint of sweeteness. It was really really good. Herbally and refreshing. Got a free refill too BC we got the large! :)"}
{"text":"Visited once at its prior location and recently featured as part of a #supportlocal catering initiative it was finally on Saturday that Flock & Fowl Downtown proved convenient, the newly launched Brunch offering daytime hours inside a beautiful space at The Ogden.  Just recently celebrating six months feeding DTLV, Chef Sheridan Su's acclaim continuing to grow with a James Beard Foundation Semi-Finalist Nod in 2018, guests entering the doors of 150 North Las Vegas Boulevard will quickly find themselves met by ornate wallpaper and a well-stocked Bar, Chef Su's Wife Jenny present and smiling as she guides guests to their seats and checks in frequently throughout the meal.  Lengthy but not wide with a view across Ogden Avenue not as interesting as the room's décor, a gentle soundtrack full on this day with the likes of Tame Impala, it was with a frequent tablemate already present sipping Iced Tea that Water was offered, no \"tap\" suggested but instead a Charcoal filtered product from Vero not infrequently seen in fine dining that carries an unannounced charge of $2 per person.  Placing the new Brunch menu atop Flock & Fowl's daily options, the words \"Brunch without booze is just a sad, late Breakfast\" falling on deaf ears with both diners and their waitress also missing the \"Choice of a side\" that was neither offered nor served despite small print below attempted cleverness, it was in five items that appetites were invested, Chef Su briefly present but the majority of cooking left in Michael Robert Rizzo's capable hands.  Slightly less than 1/3 full just past noon, Bartender Adam Rains arriving later and enjoying thick-cut French Toast with his daughter at a nearby table, it was with order deferred to one of two waitresses that Kaya Toast first came out, the rarely seen specialty featuring buttery Toast made by Douglas Taylor at Jerry's Nugget impressing by way of creamy Coconut Jam and a Sunnyside Egg plus reduced Soy though the decision to add Foie Gras was eschewed as it seems like an unnecessary, though fairly priced, up-sell.  Next served a sharable portion of Flock Frites, their omission from catering perhaps fortuitous as an on-site order straight from the fryer proved crisp and oilless with a great blend of Herbs and salinity even before adding umami via Flock Sauce, it was in follow-up that the unassuming Quinoa Salad quickly proved to be a highlight with Grains nicely cooked and slightly tangy while Cauliflower, Almonds, fried Tofu and $3-worth of additional Chinese  Sausage provided heterogeneity that never got boring.  Using a Yelp! check-in for one Bao each, the item's presence on Flock & Fowl Downtown's menu a reminder of the Su's start serving Buns at a beauty salon, it was with three great bites of Fried Chicken quickly devoured that more arrived in the hands of a younger waitress inquiring \"is this table two?\" after previously mis-delivering another plate, the golden organic Bird this time atop two brightly colored Biscuits and sautéed Greens with perfectly poached Eggs and vibrant Citrus Hollandaise.  Offering only two Desserts, though one might consider the French Toast as such during Brunch, it was with fond memories of the Cheesecake from catering still lingering that guests waited fifteen minutes for Flock & Fowl's Cast Iron Chocolate Chip Cookie, another recipe from Chef Taylor that is served gooey and thick with a big scoop Vanilla Ice Cream and delightfully complex Miso Caramel Sauce.  FOUR STARS:  Virtually faultless in terms of Food, the fact that Garlic Hummus was announced as unavailable at the start of the meal in addition to the forgotten Brunch side dish and small service errors another reminder that even a great Chef can be held-back by his staff, it would take little more than a bit of additional training and professionalism for Flock & Fowl to fly alongside Carson Kitchen, Esther's and Atomic as a true downtown dining destination."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Hainan Chicken Rice - Poached Chicken, Rice, House Sauces with added Chinese Sausage Fried Tenders and Rice Chicken Wings - Mrs Han's Twice Cooked Szechuan Chicken Wings - Thai Style with Fish Sauce, Garlic, and Lemon Cornish Game Hen with Kale, Tomato, Cucumber, Grape, Cranberry, Sunflower Seeds, Almonds, and Sesame Vinaigrette Salad Bao-Chicka-Bao Bao with Kale Slaw  Achieving unlikely success in the middle of Eureka Casino with his Great Bow-turned-Brick+Mortar Fat Choy, Sheridan Su has seemingly found success where so many others have failed largely by keeping head down, eyes up, while focusing on quality of the product, and narrowing his focus even further at recently opened Flock & Fowl the young Chef finds has proven the rare double threat with a \"do one thing and do it well\" space that gets it right.  Historically an adapted dish of early Chinese decedents from the Hainan Province, but offered throughout Asia and a few famous shops speckled around the United States, Su and his wife Jenny officially started obsessing over the dish following a visit to Taiwan and although a recipe of poached chicken and rice cooked in chicken fat may seem 'simple,' its perfection lies in the details - all of which the duo seems to have dialed in.  No more fanciful in location than Fat Choy. the renovated space on Sahara next to a pawn shop and within view of the Strip Clubs on Industrial Road in the shadow of The Strip, Flock & Fowl seems as intentionally limited in its seating as it is in its menu and with Sheridan in the Kitchen as Jenny works the room orders are placed at the counter with service fast to follow, a \"one of each\" order seeing our table of six served in three successive rounds.  Starting with Sheridan's longtime signature buns, in this case graced with crispy buttermilk soaked bird from Mary's Free Range with a bit of kale slaw and sauce, it almost seems silly that anyone could be excited about the pending opening of Chick-fil-A with such a thing available, each bite first met by pillowy bao before giving way to bittersweet flavors juxtaposing juicy, well-seasoned meat.  Rare to be wowed by wings, though always open to a change of heart, round two saw Sheridan send out a couple extra bites of each flavor to that the whole table could enjoy, and with two flavors available the only real question is which of them to order, the Szechuan expectedly the 'hotter,' though certainly not ridiculous, while the fish-sauce tossed Thai style rivaled those at Pok-Pok for flavor, if not for size.  Served all three entrees at once, easily enough to feed six adults when paired with that which had already come, suffice it to say that the Chicken tenders were perfectly fine if not particularly 'wowing' compared to the rest, yet when paired to the housemade chile sauce or chunky bits of garlic the three-piece order was an absolute steal for just $9, the crispy cornish hen another veritable steal alongside a complex and elegant salad for just a dollar more.  Speaking last to the dish Su set out to perfect it should first be said that many at the table had never sought out a truly authentic version until this date, but whether a virgin or a veteran none at the table seemed to be disappointed in the silky broiled breast or the fluffy white rice, a $2 addition of spicy Chinese sausage every bit worth the surcharge while the bonus broth was chock-a-block full of flavor without being pumped up with salt or MSG.  ****Flawed only in the inherent limitations of space, an outsourced single dessert, and menu -  the later to be remedied by specials from time-to-time - Flock & Fowl has thus far shown that perhaps Las Vegas is ready to embrace such a focused concept - the early word almost universally favorable, but a fate that only time and the fickleness of local 'media' will tell."}
{"text":"Singaporean food! I was craving for something different & this was a good mix of asian food. Located off the end of the strip. Definitely a hidden little gem next to other shops that aren't even restaurants. Small parking lot.  * Ordered: - Chicken Bacon Truffle Burger (4/5 stars): Talk about egg porn! This was one of their off the menu specials & the fact that I'm not much of a fan of bacon in my burger, the egg drew me to ordering this. Anything with \"truffle\" in it, you already know it's going to be a crazy combination of other food in the burger. I loved how it was served with potato chips & a large sliced pickle. It balances out the salty part of the burger to sour to sweet.   - One buttermilk fried chicken bao (4/5 stars): This is the main reason why we went here! What was deceiving was the portion size. I didn't know it would be a mini size until they asked if I wanted one or two. It seemed like a snack to others, but this could be just another meal if you order 2. Crispy, buttery, & soft on the bun side. Thankful we decided on this!  - #3 Roasted Spring Chicken with Rice (4/5 stars): AH! Such a good plate filled with both rice, chicken, & lemon with seasoning to squeeze all over. I love the way they roasted the chicken. It was perfect to its crisp.  - Milk Green Tea & Vietnamese coffee (5/5 stars): These 2 drinks were first served to us & I almost finished it before the food even got to us! SO good! The milk green tea was not just any green tea, it was very mellow on the milky side. I loved it! Same goes for the Vietnamese coffee. Something to keep us awake throughout the day yet very light on the coffee side.  * Service (4/5 stars): Shout out to LIZ! She was our sweetest waitress! She acknowledged our outfits & conversed with us like any other customers dining in. She deserves the full 5/5 stars for her friendly service, checking up on us, & made us feel welcome. As for the girl who took our order at the register, she didn't seem pleased to serve us. Simply took our order & gave our number, nothing too dramatic, just no expression of a smile & kept talking to her coworkers. They have a \"House Rules\" posted & it seems as though to help them better, TAKE YOUR ORDERS TO GO! It's such a small dine in that it's understandable that they'd love to serve everyone but simply can't because they do not have the space for it. \"To go is helping you, help us, help you\"  Oh & rule number 9, when you're in Vegas though... \"No shirt. No shoes. No service.\" Straight up & simple!"}
{"text":"Sheridan Su and Jenny Wong have done it again. Their success with Fat Choy is due to their great business sense and people skills: offer good food at affordable prices. Flock and Fowl just has more sophistication, shall I say.   They are located at the same complex as Golden Steer. Currently, their business hours are limited. Seating is limited (about 5 small tables) but you can always take your food to-go instead. They have about 5 organic poultry menu items/combos. But the freshly made drinks and the Hainan chicken rice are the business!  Hainan Chicken Rice: First of all, I'm not a big fan of chicken skin that is white. If it's not BBQ'ed, fried, baked, or roasted to a golden brown - I refuse to eat it. I avoid Hainan chicken rice at all costs...but not this time! I'd have to say, this is the first Hainan chicken rice I've ever liked. Ok so maybe, I removed the chicken skin but the sliced chicken pieces were juicy. You dip the chicken in sambal, garlic ginger or soy sauce...or maybe, all 3. Then, eat it with the fragrant and flavorful rice with mustard greens. 5/5  Bao Chicka Bao Bao: A big hot juicy chicken tender in a bao (steamed bun) with kale and sauce. There's nothing quite like it. Soft bao + crispy kale and chicken. Yuuuummm!!! 5/5  Lemon Tea: Refreshing and fragrant without being too tart. Jenny makes a fresh batch from scratch as needed. 5/5  Milk Green Tea: If you want a somewhat richer kind of drink, this is a good option. It's floral and slightly creamy. 4.5/5  Jenny can make adjustments to your drink if you want it sweeter, more tart, etc. They're genuinely nice. They remember customers' names. They take time to chat with you."}
{"text":"I came here for a late night dinner. Luckily they were still open. The restaurant was nice and small. I ordered the traditional Hainanese chicken plate with an hr egg and chicken broth. I also got the salt and pepper chicken wings as an appetizer. O-m-g, where do I begin? The chicken wings were nicely crisped on the outside and tender in the inside. Just the way I like my wings! Next, the entree: the Hainanese chicken was mixed with both white and dark meat, and went deliciously well with the three dipping sauces that it came with on the side. The one hour egg was a new concept for me but it goes quite well with the sweet rice. Lastly, the bone broth was very tasty and savory. My mouth is salivating just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Really good, from the atmosphere to the excellent service to the food.  My roasted chicken was moist and delicious and the Phillipines rice with egg was the highlight.  Make sure to try the side of chicken skin, which was fun and different.  Very tasty and a good experience all-around"}
{"text":"Been here about 7-8 times and honestly it's one of my favs! Everything I've had has been wonderful and the service has been great.  I live out of town but every time I make it to Vegas (every other week) I make it a point to come here.  The sauces are great, the chicken is divine and it looks like they have several things i still need to try like the fried rice and the Katsu! Looking forward to it. I wish they had a place like This in Phoenix"}
{"text":"My friends and I recently went to Flock & Fowl for lunch due to the awesome reviews. I love eating Hainan Chicken when I can. I often visit Savoy Kitchen in Alhambra for the dish and I have tried the popular Nong's Khao Man Gai in Portland, Oregon as well. Of course, Flock & Fowl's version is different -- I do believe they base theirs on Taiwan's version.   My friends and I all ordered the Hainan Chicken ($8.99) to try. Two of my friends ordered Chinese sausage ($1.99) with it. Other than Chinese sausage, you can add on an egg, broth, or salad. Each dish comes with a mix of dark and white meat chicken -- organic free ranged chicken at that. It also comes with rice, which is traditionally cooked with chicken broth but judging from the rice's consistency and flavor, I can't say it was traditionally done. On the side is some cucumbers and pickled mustard greens. Then on a tray is three different sauces for you: ginger and scallion, a sweet soy, and a spicy sauce.   The chicken itself is very tender and juicy. It was prepared beautifully. However, perhaps I'm just not used to organic chicken...the flavor just isn't there for me. The essence of chicken is missing. Even when I use the ginger and scallion sauce on it, it just doesn't bring about the same reaction as I usually get. Also,I normally love chicken skin and the aroma it comes with. I don't necessarily eat it often though because I've had some pretty bad experiences as a child. The chicken skin that came with the chicken here at Flock & Fowl just does not make me excited.   The rice was fantastic. I love rice. I love rice that isn't mushy. The rice here had just the right amount of bite to it. The flavors were really subtle. I kind of wish that they used chicken broth to make it. But hell ... What's even better? Mixing the ginger and scallion sauce into the rice and eating it!   Chinese sausage is really good. Chinese sausage is like a comfort food to me so it has a dear place in my heart. The flavors are great with rice so definitely give it a try.   As for the service, I guess I could give them the benefit of the doubt that there is literally only one person working the restaurant front. Though, something stood out to me that I absolutely did not understand. My boyfriend and I were standing in line to order and when it was our turn, the phone rang. It turned out to be a phone order and it turned out that the phone order came before us, regardless of the fact that we've been waiting long before that phone order was placed. Not to mention that it was a good 30+ minute wait for our food.   The establishment is also really tiny. There is only about five tables or so. No restrooms. Sorry. You'll have to go to Capriottis for that one.   End point. I would probably justify it with a 3.5 rating. I liked it .. I just didn't love it -- aside from the rice and pickled mustard greens that is. The wait and the \"put phone orders first\" was definitely not a plus on this one. So even if I do give it another go, I would only do take out. Doing take out means I'll be able to cut in front of whoever is in line during that time.   I've had better but not in Vegas. If you compare to the other places in Vegas that serve Hainan Chicken, Flock & Fowl is definitely a solid and #1 choice."}
{"text":"Okay listen,   there's pretty good food, and there's great food.  Not only is the concept creative but the ingredients are amazing and the staff is stellar. The chicken bao is innovative and satisfying. The broth is veratile as a sauce as well."}
{"text":"My dish was a chef's special called curry fried rice or something.  I was very excited to try it at first and when it came it looks amazing and smelled amazing, BUT it was extremely salty and difficult to eat. I was only able to eat about 1/8 of it until I decided to take it home and see if it was savable by eating it with plain rice instead.  Unfortunately I'll don't know since my boyfriend look it home instead. (Don't plan on asking him, since a few months have passed by lol.) Everyone else in my group ordered the specialty Hainan chicken said it was nothing special.  They said they would be content with Hainan chicken from Big Wong or any other Chinese restaurant as they taste better and for less, but the chicken would not be free range.  There was a table next to mine where the guy had barely touched his food a women who worked there asked if everything was okay with their meal.  To make it short, he said the Hainan chicken was nothing special and not worth the price paid.   If you really need free range chicken, go right ahead, but don't expect anything better in flavor than a typical restaurant that serve Hainan Chicken and maybe ask for less salt if you ever order the fried rice.  I don't think I would be back to try anything else since their location is out of the way as well as their menu variety is small.  Workers are friendly though!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Flock & Fowl for a while now, and finally got to go last Friday with an old high school friend.  We walked in and was given two options of where to sit, we sat down and then no one gave us a menu for about five minutes. My friend and I just sat there taking and looking around to see if someone was going to approach us with a menu.   I ordered the traditional chicken and rice, and my friend ordered the fried chicken and rice.  You get too sides- I got bone broth and she got a egg. We both had a side of the sausage.  The service was good for the rest of the night.  Bathroom was clean. Dinning area was clean. There's a parking lot right across the restaurant as well as street parking. $3/hour.  You get a free buttermilk chicken bao when you check in on yelp! You should try it!"}
{"text":"I just came back to Vegas for the first time in a year and immediately came here for lunch and it was closed! After reading the reviews, I'm still not sure if this location is reopened? Jenny can you help?"}
{"text":"After one visit I'm hooked with Flock & Fowl.   I usually like the try a place a handful of times before officially christening it with a rating, but the meal and experience I just had was special enough to warrant an instant 5 star review from me.     I might get my foodie card pulled with this admission, but I've never been to Great Bao or Fat Choy and am completely unfamiliar with the food of Jenny Wong and Sheridan Su outside of what I've read online.   This was a heck of an introduction.  I was almost scared off by some of the reviews stating long lines and long waits.   It was roughly 12:15 when I arrived on a Wednesday and I had ordered by 12:20 and had food on by roughly 12:30.   I may have just lucked out, but I guess the moral of my story is don't let the fear of a long line or wait scare you out of going.     The menu is small so ordering is quick and painless, especially if you're the type like me to just agree to any/all add-ons.   Number 1: Hainan Chicken and Rice.  Egg?  Chinese Sausage?   Why yes, I'll take both.   Chicken Broth?  Sure!  My gluttony knows very little limits, I was almost tempted to try one of the baos or some wings but then I realized there's always next week, or tomorrow...    Back to my experience today.   After receiving my iced lemon tea which had a great balance and just the right amount of tart, my food arrived shortly after.  It was presented quite beautifully, with the fried egg perfectly perched upon a heaping mound of rice, the tray of 3 sauces, and the perfectly cooked de-boned chicken and chinese sausage.   Off to the side was the cup of chicken broth.   At this exact moment, food and drink in front of me, Jenny (can I go first name basis at this point?) having just explained all the components of the dish to me, I'll admit I was frightened.  In what is one of my top 500 most embarrassing google searches of all time, before I drive to Flock & Fowl for lunch I googled \"How to eat Hainan Chicken\"   If any of you work for the NSA you can confirm this fact.  Not having found much help or guidance there, I looked at Jenny and showed all my cards and asked her.   She assuredly answered that I can do whatever the flock I wanted to and there was no right way.    WHAT A RELIEF!   My foodie fear out the window, I started meticulously attacking this meal.  There are hundreds of combinations of bites you can create with all the components I had, and as the plate got less full, I was creating them with reckless abandon.   Oh let me get a piece of the chicken, dunk that into the broth, then into the soy, then add scallion, a piece of egg, and some rice, and shove that all into my mouth.   Outcome:  delicious.   I didn't have one bite that I thought was subpar.     Jenny was a gracious host the entire meal, and was constantly checking on every customer eating there.  As I was about to leave, I had finished my lemon tea and wanted to try the oolong.   I never like to assume free refills unless I'm at some conglomerate owned-chain, so I pulled out a $5 bill ready to pay for another, but Jenny graciously told me she could just refill my empty Lemon Tea cup.   As I expected given the quality of everything else I had prior, it's also delicious.  Flocking Amazing."}
{"text":"We went to Flock and Fowl before our show at the Smith Center.  We had a few problems and were unable to bring them up with management because we had to get to our show.  We had: Chicken Wings with honey butter on the side - Really tasty. Big juicy wings, I'm glad we got the sauce on the side though because I found it spicy.  (My friends laughed and said the kick is very mild) Hainanese Chicken - I thought this was the best dish of the night.  I had the traditional style chicken, fried egg, and farmer's market veg.  The chicken was moist, flavorful, and one of the best renditions of Hainanese Chicken I have ever had.   I'd come back for this and the chicken wings. Hot Flock Sando - this chicken was terrible.  It was dry and tough.  The bread was tasty but it was ruined by the chicken. Butcher's Steak - this too was dry and overcooked and the sauce was too cloying. Cast Iron Chocolate Chip Cookie - The miso caramel sauce was AMAZING.  This is a dish that definitely has to be shared.  The biggest problem we had was the lack of communication with the waiter/kitchen staff.  We told them from the start that we had a show to catch.  Yet the service was so slow and slow to tell us they were out of items, and slow to give us our check, etc."}
{"text":"This is the new Flock & Fowl in Downtown area. New location but same great food and now is a full service restaurant. The place is swanky and right by Fremont Street Experience. Not only they've expanded their menu, they now have a full bar. Yes all you alcohol lovers, you can now enjoy a glass of wine or a cocktail along with their amazing Hainanese chicken, roasted Cornish hen or their new amazing super juicy tasty burger and many more. One of the must try from their new menu is the Son-in-law of Deviled Eggs. Soooo good!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. It's small but definitely one Vegas's hidden gem. They have the most amazing Hainanese chicken rice. Their other menu items are awesome too. I'm here at least once a week. The owner, Jenny is super sweet. Love their staff, Jaime and Gino too. They are always super friendly and genuine. This is a perfect example of a restaurant with great food and happy people. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"TLDR - tasty Hainan chicken, friendly staff, good spot for something healthy  My friends and I stopped by here for a late lunch while entering Vegas. The place is rather small so it's not great for groups. Even at 2PM, it was busy enough that my group of 9 had to be split into 3 tables. Otherwise, it has a hipster vibe to it and the staff are so friendly and cheery, it's contagious.  I heard from one of my friends that they sometimes run out of their popular Hainan Chicken Rice, but luckily they still had it for our late lunch. You can also get Buttermilk Fried Tenders or Roasted Spring Chicken with rice instead of the normal poached chicken, and there's a salad option if you're not feeling rice. They also have wings and baos.  I'm not a rice person so I was glad there was a salad, which you could get with any of the 3 chicken options:  * ORGANIC SALAD ($10.99) - 4/5 [organic veggies, dried and fresh fruit, nuts and seeds] The salad consisted of mixed greens, strawberries, grapes, dried cranberries, sliced almonds, granola and some sort of dressing/vinaigrette. Simple salad with a refreshing sweetness from the fresh/dried fruit. I wasn't too fond of the granola though. It was a little soggy from the dressing and made me feel like I was eating cereal, so I wish they had called that out on the menu so I could have left it out. I got my salad with the Hainan chicken, which was perfectly poached. I wasn't expecting bones since I'm used to deboned Hainan chicken, but it was super tender and juicy!"}
{"text":"Delicious little chicken pit spot in Vegas. Totally worth the stop if you're passing through. We had almost everything on the menu and it was all great. I especially loved the roasted spring chicken plate, so so yummy! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Omg!  If you come to this place make sure Amy is your bar tender. WILL follow this woman where ever she tends bar !   She is awesome! !  Lots of fun and a great lychee knees.   I really can't say enough compliments about the drinks and this woman!  We also had Greg. Now, this guy is the real deal!  Fun a knowledgeable.  David  is the Manager on duty and also had us in stitches.   In short, knowledgeable fun staff   Great service and great product !!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it half star ratings it would be a 3.5/5 but based on my past experiences at the original restaurant, it deserves a 4 for the sake of them being able to improve. I don't know if it's because of all the new items on the menu but I felt that with them keeping it simple the food quality tasted better. Having a table be near where the food comes out of maybe didn't help as well as I literally saw a chicken sando that we ordered stay under the heat lamp for a good 15mins while waiting for the other dishes to be done causing that shit to be hella hard. With that being said this is what we ordered:  Miso Black Garlic Hummus - Sounded interesting but after trying it, nothing special.  Chicken Wings - Half of the order was Angry Sauce which tasted like Szechuan spices and Sriracha and the other half was Honey Butter which was a mild sweet and savory flavor. Both were executed well.  Quinoa Salad w/ Fried Cauliflower & Tofu - Done really well and was a cold refreshing dish on a hot sunny day. Subtle flavors but the fried cauliflower was good  Kaya Toast - It was French Toast's sister for sure. This dish was bomb and I could only imagine what it would be like with the Foie Gras (which we didn't order -_-)....  The Butcher's Steak - I don't know if it's because they ordered it well-done (I don't know whyyyyyyyy) but it looked like a very sad dish. Curly frites was similar to Jack in the Crack's curly fries...a little thickness to the fries could give it more of a premium feel...  The Hot Flock Sando - Again maybe because it was sitting under the heat lamp for a long time but this chicken was dry and bread was borderline firm and hard on the outside...I can see this being really good but this attempt left it very underwhelming...  Bang Bang Chicken Noodle Salad - Not the greatest fan of cold noodle dishes but the flavor was good...reminded me of a south east asian hiyashi chuka....  Hainanese Chicken Rice - Not as good as the first time I had it and the chicken had some chewy cartilage bits that I am not a fan of....I felt the house soy was a little different...and the 1-hour egg is bomb....might have to try it again a third time...  While this restaurant is good on it's own merit I feel like because I have been to the original, the new restaurant with their expanded menu felt like a disappointment compared to the limited menu and food at the og location."}
{"text":"Went here one day during lunch and have always wanted to try this place. Never had chicken rice before and heard this place is good.   I ordered the numero uno which is the 1/4 Poached Chicken and when they served it I was like \"this shit looks plain as fuck\". It was as if someone decided to make a dish that was supossed to be dipped in sauce like a boss but instead after they prepared it they washed the sauce off and was left sauceless. I then proceeded to cut the chicken with a knife and fork and low and behold this plain looking chicken had some flavor to it. The rice was fire too.  The dish felt very clean and healthy but the sauces made it flavorful and you can tell everything was fresh. It's just something you appreciate after eating all that junk food in your life.  One thing is the price for the amount of food you get is small but the quality of the food you get is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious - recommend the traditional poached chicken or the chicken tenders. The coffee was also excellent. Wait staff was warm, welcoming and helpful. On the important stuff, Flock and Fowl excels.   My only criticism: I think management should rethink their ordering/serving system. It was crowded at lunch and if this Places gets more popular - as I suspect it will - the long lines created by the ordering system will be a major turn off."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious that it makes me sad I don't live in Vegas.  I'd probably be here every day that they're open if I did!  Thanks to the reviewers who recommended getting here early - we arrived before 11:30 AM on a Tuesday before our drive home to CA and there was one other party already there, but after we placed our order and sat down the place totally filled up!  No public restrooms - you'll be told that pretty much the moment you step in.  I love the space - so bright and clean!  Order and pay at the counter, then grab a seat.    We shared a Hainan chicken rice ($8.99), 4-piece Thai wings ($4.99), 2 chicken baos ($6.99) and an iced lemon tea ($2.99).  The Hainan chicken was really moist and the rice was flavorful, the Thai wings had a delicious sauce coating the super crispy skin, the chicken baos were amazing as well.  The lemon tea (which Jenny brews herself) was different than the overly sweet lemon tea that you might get at an HK cafe, but it was refreshing and I liked the tartness (part of the flavor reminded me of sour plum).  Looking forward to coming back on our next Vegas trip and trying everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"OMG, what a find! The food is Asian based, so unique and tasty. They have poached spring chicken with rice, with a huge salad of fresh kale, sprouts, pea shoots that's crazy good. I had the wings in a honey Sriracha Sauce or you can have it in a Thai Carmel sauce. They have these buttermilk fried tenders which looked orgasmic. I highly recommend this place. Oh, btw only open between 10 am to 3:30 pm"}
{"text":"Tried out this Asian fusion place right after we landed in Las Vegas and dropped our bags at our hotel.  I had actually bookmarked their other location as something to try after doing some research but was pleasantly surprised to see another one in the downtown area.   When we walked in it was bumping for lunch service.  Turns out it was their grand opening!   They didn't come back for quite some time at the host podium but it turned out they were preparing a table for us in the back which was obscured by the bar.    For food we ordered their Signature Hainanese Rice with a 1/2 roasted Cornish game hen that came with 2 sides where we selected: 1 Hour egg, daily veggie and ordered a snack of 8 pc chicken wings half honey butter and half angry sauce.   Chicken Wings: delicious!  The angry sauce wasn't very spicy.  The honey butter wings are highly recommended!  The Hainanese rice wasn't the Singaporean style I was expecting but was more a fusion play on an asian classic which I feel they did it justice.  Chicken was delicious and juicy! The sauces for dipping were not the traditional ones so it wasn't to my liking.  That doesn't mean it would not work for others!  The staff was well coordinated and nice.  I'd come back and eat here again.    The only off-putting thing was the spot they sat us at was in a high traffic area so several customers did bump into my seat on their way in.  I didn't complain as I was enjoying the food but a customer of a fairly large size would've not been able to sit there for the entire service without losing it.    On our way out the owner was at the bar chatting it up with her staff and she was so happy and genuine.  Really a good workplace vibe!  Good place for food!"}
{"text":"I had to swing by there because they forgot to send something with the rest of my uber order. This place is super small. You'll miss it if you blink while driving by. Food is pretty good. The bao is good and the wings are amazing! The chicken with ginger sauce is decent, no real wow factor compared to other Chinese restaurants that serve this on their menu. In fact, I may of had better. And the portions are fair. If you are a big eater, you may leave there not fully satisfied. The wait staff was nice and personable. Overall, I'd go back but it would be one place that I'd have to compare with other restaurants depending on what I'm craving and how hungry I am"}
{"text":"This is a lunch place! i really love their Hainan chicken rice and i only order this."}
{"text":"Ambiance + Randy (not our server) was super helpful and attentive  - wish our seating had brighter lights, couldn't clearly see the food we were eating  - service was slow, but maybe that's cuz we were seated in the back. There were delays in ordering, getting refills on water, and asking for a to go box and having to ask another server.   Flock Frites + fries are fried well and crispy - taste like jack in the box curly fries, kinda salty too - sauce is too salty and the fish/soy sauce is too prominent. Would a touch of citrus help?  Free friend chicken buttermilk bao w/ check in + soft bao/covering and the chicken is crunchy and juicy - veggies don't really go well with the chicken, I personally would have preferred cilantro or another type of green  Chicken Rice  + delicious ginger and garlic, spicy sauce + chicken was crispy and roasted well, the flavorful skin was balanced by the lemon and meat - the rice for the chicken rice eaten back home was cooked with margarine and chicken stock but this one was too plain   Laksa +/- flavor of the noodles are good without being salty but the noodles were too cooked and soft/soggy - super salty chicken bites  Summary: it's possible to be flavorful without being overly salty,"}
{"text":"Coming from a place where chicken rice is a national favorite. . Fellow singaporeans, this place is legit man!!! the chilli and ginger sauces are totally what you have from home. The chicken is tender and the rice is flavourful. Certified xia!!"}
{"text":"Excellent for hainan chicken for Las Vegas.   Not as good as hainan chicken in San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles (Green Zone).   Still, been all over US and this place is still top 10.    Chicken was very well executed and the rice was spot on.   I think what the problem is that Vegas doesn't really have old chicken (young chicken have no taste) so you work with what you've got.  Parking wasn't as bad as I thought and service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in town. I usually come here during lunch break on weekdays. It does get very busy, and you have to be careful with coming here with a larger group for there aren't many tables (although they've expanded to some outdoor seating). I would say that's the only drawback to this place - its popularity. My favorite dish is still the no.1 signature hainan poached chicken. I usually just get it without any add-ons, but would get the taiwanese sausage if I'm more hungry. The service is great. Jenny and the rest of the staff is well-informed about the dishes and their ingredients, and would always introduce them to any newcomers. The food tastes super good and is a healthy option as well. The limited number of seats could be inconvenient, but most of the time it's definitely worth the wait for me. The food and service is awesome. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"The food is so good! Such cute little place to have lunch, and ONLY lunch. Wish their place was a bit bigger and offered dinner as well. Been there once so far since it's kinda far from us and only offers lunch. But will defintely try to go back again. The price is very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Great food and super nice owner/staff but needs a bathroom.   - In a small strip mall just off of the 15 and Sahara, north of the strip which was a great road trip stop to Utah - Small lot but no trouble parking  - Weird bathroom situation (it's in the costume shop next door. You ring the doorbell and wait til someone answers it and then they direct you to the back of the store, to their very homey store bathroom) - Closed Mondays   Food: - #1 Original Hainan Chicken Rice - comes with pickled cucumbers, mustard greens, ginger sauce, soy, and chili sauce. They use Mary's chicken and it's super moist and clean tasting. - Chicken broth (additional $0.99) - this was oilier than expected. Probably would not get again but seemed like a natural accompaniment.  - Vietnamese iced coffee - choice of single or double shot and they use the right coffee (the orange cans!) Less sweet than other places which I liked."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and ordered their Haiwanese rice which I was told is the most popular dish in the menu. The portion was substantial and comes with two sides. I asked for veggies and one hour egg.  The rice was delicious. They give u 3 options for the chicken prep - traditional, fried or roasted. I was told traditional means poached. I opted for the roast chicken after making sure that it will be crispy. It certainly was crispy but for some reason it was drenched in oil. It almost looked like fried chicken. In fact my friend thought I must have been given fried chicken. The greasiness of chicken is what really put me off this place and made me give it three stars. I'm not fond of greasy food. I expect my roast chicken to be moist and crispy without being greasy.  I'm also not sure why the one hour egg was called a one hour egg. It was good but it looked and tasted like a poached egg to me. Nothing unusual or fancy.  Service was good. Neither exceptionally good nor remarkably bad."}
{"text":"The poached chicken / hainanese chicken rice and the chicken broth are the best over there :) reminded my friends and I of Singapore. The sauces were really great too, especially the sambal Chilli. I was surprised to find dark soy sauce here too because I rarely find that around."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place was brand new! The bartender said they haven't even had their grand opening yet. The decor inside is pretty cool and I came here because a friend of mine told me it was new and they have good drinks. Overall I really liked it and would go back. They also had one vegan option to eat on the menu. It was the broccoli, quinoa and tofu salad, served chilled (which was a surprise but still very tasty!)"}
{"text":"Owner super friendly and checked on us numerous times including explaining the orgins of this restaurant (Taipei, if you can believe it) and the quality of their food.  Rice a bit hard for my liking but that is their \"style\" if you will.  Sauces good too but feel like the dipping sauces should be in front of you vs on the right side. Now i gotta go try ??? or Boon Keng Chicken in Taipei next time i go back!"}
{"text":"My blogger friend had raved about Flock & Fowl and since we were staying in DTLV we decided to check it out.  We went for the Hainan Chicken, the fried and traditional and our sides were the chinese sausage, farmers market vegetables and 1 hour egg.  It also came with this delicious rice which we found out was cooked in chicken fat.  Both were really good but when I go back we will order the traditional and try the roasted.  The traditional chicken was so soft and tender and the sauces were so flavorful.  I wanted to try the skillet cookie for dessert but we had an early dinner to go to so we didn't order it.  We will be back the next time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Found this on the Eater list for Vegas. Unfortunately, a pretty sub-par experience for something that should be fairly easy to do well, and is indeed done well at many other places around the world. While the poached chicken itself was actually pretty decent, the food fell short everywhere else. Rice was riddled with crunchy dried out or uncooked bits. The sauces were odd, and stingy in quantity. The soup was overly salty and not especially flavorful. The coddled egg, and the service, however, were both very good.   So, in summary, this place could be good if they'd fix their rice and sauces - two damn crucial parts of the Hainan chicken experience."}
{"text":"There's a reason that Chef Sheridan Su and his wife Jenny Wong have been named Restaurateurs of the Year  for 2017 by Desert Companion Magazine: their food is fabulous. I am a huge fan of the Hainan Chicken Rice at Flock & Fowl. I could really eat it every day if I had to; it's the perfect combo of tasty protein and carbs for me. If there's another restaurant in Las Vegas that's making this dish this good, I haven't heard about it.  The only drawback with the first location of Flock and Fowl is that it is not open for dinner.  That is no longer an issue with the opening of Flock & Fowl #2 located in downtown Las Vegas in the Ogden building. Same great chicken rice and service, but at night time! There are several other menu items here from Chef Sheridan Su and crew that you cannot get at FF #1 such as the Son-In-Law Deviled Eggs (recommend these!), All Natural Cheese Burger, Broccoli and Quinoa Salad, Laksa, and the warm Chocolate Chip cookie with vanilla bean ice cream and miso caramel sauce.   Our party of eight had dinner here last night and several of these dishes were on the table.  I had my usual Hainan Chicken Rice with the additions of a fried egg and Chinese sausage to complete the dish.  I also ordered a cup of the Egg Drop soup which had plenty of egg in a  delectable bone broth, spinach, shimeji mushrooms, and fried garlic - a very good accompaniment to my meal.  Troi, our server, was excellent and so was the rest of the staff.  As Norm K. mentioned in his review, Chef Su and wife Jenny were on hand to greet us and Jenny checked on us more than once.  FF #2 is a wonderful addition to Downtown Las Vegas and I know that we'll be back for more. NOTE:  This restaurant is on a cash-less system so be prepared to pay with debit or credit cards only."}
{"text":"I've been to Flock & Fowl three times now and I'm already dreaming of when I'll go back again.  This is one of the rare places that I will gladly order chicken since I already eat so much of it, but my chicken is boring compared to Chef Su's.  From the Hainanese Chicken to the rice that's prepared with chicken stock and chicken fat, you cannot go wrong ordering this signature dish.  I actually dream about it when I'm at work, at home, at the gym.  The only drawback is that Flock & Fowl is not open for dinner because I'd go a lot more if it were.  My review is already just another glowing one for this place, but I heartily agree with all the other 5 stars this chicken shoppe has bestowed upon it.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I adore the original Flock & Fowl on Sahara. It truly is one of the most special and unique restaurants in Las Vegas. The menu items are small and simple, but exquisite. So needless to say, I was pumped when I heard they were bringing a new and bigger version to Downtown Las Vegas.  However, I think the new location is just that - too new and too big. While the Signature Hainanese Chicken is still on the menu, the price is raised to $14.99 with two ad-ons. Please don't miss out on the Chinese sausage - it'll change your life. The quality of the food is still wonderful and I enjoyed my meal thoroughly.  Another differentiating factor is an extensive cocktail menu. While all of the drinks sounded enchanting, I had to try the Mezcal Milk Tea. The cocktail presented was gorgeous and the flavors were complex. However, the cocktail was 90 percent ice and served with a flimsy paper straw that made it impossible to drink. I was definitely a little irked that I spent $11 on a cocktail that was so watered down and challenging to consume.  The service at Flock & Fowl has some room for improvement. While everyone was nice, attentive and eager-to-please, it took awhile for our drinks to get to us, and then my friend ordered deviled eggs which never arrived before our entrees, so she just canceled the order. Then they committed my least favorite 21st century restaurant move and made us pay and tip for everything on an iPad...while the server stood over us and watched. This is a bit uncomfortable and led me to tip higher than I probably would have based on our experience.   Do I still love Flock & Fowl? Of course. Does the DTLV location still need a bit of work before it reaches the quaint, intimate nature of the Sahara spot? Definitely."}
{"text":"I want to come here again and eat real foods! I went to get cocktails and a delicious looking brownie. Bad news, they no longer had the brownie! Also, they did not tell me this when I ordered the brownie. They did bring a deep dish cookie with caramel and ice cream and it was super delish....but not exactly the brownie I ordered. Oh well. The cocktails we're strooooong and tasty. I'll be back to try the food next time."}
{"text":"A bit underwhelmed by Flock & Fowl.  The space and the service were excellent, so there is nothing much more to say about that. The things that didn't blow me away was the food.  In all the photos on Yelp, the food looks absolutely fantastic. Excellent presentation, mouth-watering color palate. My eyes were definitely happy, but the taste just didn't follow suit.  The wings weren't very sweet and otherwise bland. We had to use the hot sauce from my Hainanese chicken rice dish just to get it to decent. The Son in Law eggs were also a bit of a miss. Felt just like eggs with some stuff on top. I did like my Hainanese chicken rice dish, though. The sides of Chinese sausage and sauteed vegetables were nice.  There is much better food to be had in LV. I'd flock somewhere else if you had a limited number of meals in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on the opening night. Overall it was a good experience. Service was excellent; my server,  busboy, and the manager(I think) were very attentive and friendly. The menu was pretty small which I'm fine with. We ordered the wings and had the the angry sauce and honey butter. Angry sauce was really good not too spicy but very flavorful; the honey butter just okay, a lot of butter and very little honey. For entree we had two orders of Hainanese chicken, originally the plan was to order one Laksa and one chicken rice to share but they ran out the Laksa by around 9pm. I was a little disappointed but the chicken didn't disappoint; very tender and tasty. We had the bone broth, one hour egg, and veggie for side dishes. All of them were fine, the bone broth was just little too salty for my taste. Another hiccup was the ginger and scallion sauce it had a bitter aftertaste; we brought it to the manager's attention and she told us that the chef was trying something new but would switch back since other customers had the same issue. And we finished our meal with the cast iron chocolate chips cookie. The miso caramel actually worked great on the cookie. We enjoyed our meal and only thing we wish they had dark meat for the Hainanese  Chicken which I prefer. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The staff is really helpful when choosing your meal. Very knowledgeable.   There's some interesting and different dishes, which is nice. We had the spring rolls and edamame (not so different) for appetizers. We had 6 people at the table and they brought us 10 rolls. Edamame was dressed with a sweet tangy sauce.   I was the only person at the table that did not get the signature dish. Both people sitting to my left and to my right both wanted to try my sandwich and they too liked it better than their meal. Fries and side sauce come with the sandwich. The side sauce was just alright, very creamy and what tasted like mayonnaise.   I see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"The customer care was great and I enjoyed the atmosphere- very hipster. While the food was creative I found the flavours to be lackluster especially in comparison the traditional recipes they were built off of. Nevertheless good food at a reasonable and fair price."}
{"text":"This is a simple place with quirky workflow - i.e., you order and pre-pay at the counter, but at the same time they have full service at the tables. But once you get past that, the food and service are exceptional. The day we went in for lunch they had a lemonade iced tea with blueberries that was delicious. The iced Vietnamese coffee was also great. Highly recommended and definitely worth getting a taxi from the strip to come eat here."}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl is a nice lunch spot with delicious chicken dishes ranging from chicken wings to the hainan style chicken which is poached to perfection.  Very flavorful and robust sauces accompany the dishes which compliment the chicken very well.  I've tried the hainan chicken special which comes with rice and a few cucumbers and is always consistent.  The roasted chicken is great as well with a crispy skin and juicy inside."}
{"text":"A hidden gem off the strip near Sahara, this cute little place has a great Hainanese Chicken Rice and fried chicken bao. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food and absolutely amazing staff!! The whole staff from the beginning to the end of our dinner was so helpful with the menu and always checking on us and refilling our drinks!! Great staff!!!!"}
{"text":"The \"Hype\" surrounding Hainan Chicken rice seems a little odd to me.  I have grown up with the Cantonese Boiled chicken served with Chinese Hot Mustard (truthfully Coleman's Hot British Mustard), light soy sauce and a touch of the Chinese Holy Trinity (garlic, ginger, and scallion).  The Hainan chicken is an interesting version of this Cantonese staple.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, including the three wonderful sauces.  We also had a version of chicken congee or \"Gai Jook.\"  I finished my healthy-sized lunch with some of the Thai wings-- a little sweet, and tasty.  I wanted to try the chicken bao but did not have the appetite.  I am so used to immersing my steamed white rice with chicken broth that its use in the chicken rice was not unusual.    This tiny restaurant without a restroom, understands that it is all about the food!  The owner has a wonderful personality, and I thoroughly enjoyed her company.  I find humorous some of the Yelp reviews who criticize her for being too friendly and attentive.  Many customers even Yelpers have always believed that the world revolves around them???  Anyway, I would take this family business that concentrates on fresh ingredients, and some old fashioned entrepreneurship, before any of the so called \"Asian Fusion\" restaurants.  If you like chicken and rice you need to visit Flock & Fowl!  Do not miss it!  Viva Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We decided to have lunch here as our first food stop in Vegas.   We arrived at a packed house. The place is really cute. You ordered your food at the counter first and they will seat you when a table is ready. I decided to go with the buttermilk chicken tenders and I added Chinese sausage.   We finally got our table and food was brought out nice and hot. First had a taste of the rice and the rice is delicious. I love rice already but this rice was full of flavors. I was a happy camper with just eating the rice. Next, I took a bite of my buttermilk fried chicken and my chicken was so moist. It was cooked beautiful and tasted great. I enjoyed the marinated cucumber and the preserved mustard greens they give to you on the plate. MMmmm... I love the mustard greens. Everything coming together really balances itself really well. Also, all plates do come with three dipping sauces. The three sauces were house-made ginger scallion sauce, house-made chile, and house-made soy. I thought everything was seasoned well and the flavors were on point that I didn't need the sauces, however, it did make a pretty picture.    Overall, I would come back again. It's a great option when you are sick of eating buffet and American food."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 1-2-16 around 11:30 AM.  This restaurant is located on Sahara just west of Las Vegas Blvd, but further west than the shopping center that houses the Golden Steer.  It's in a scary shopping center where most of the stores have bars on the windows and you can throw a rock in any direction and hit a strip club.    We were greeted with \"HELLO WELCOME WE DO NOT HAVE HIGH CHAIRS OR A PUBLIC BATHROOM\".  Woah, lady!  Dial it down a notch! I felt really bad for her because she was doing literally everything but making the food.  She took the orders, ran the food, and bussed the tables.  Can we get this lady some helpers before she has an aneurysm please? She's a hard worker for sure!  So much hustle!   Order your food at the counter AND THEN SIT DOWN or else this lady might reprimand you like she did the people behind us.    $35.70 got us a hainan chicken dinner, a cornish game hen dinner, a vietnamese coffee, and a green tea.    $8.99 Hainan chicken dinner comes with three dipping sauces (ginger scallion sauce + house made chile + house made soy) rice, pickled cucumbers, and preserved mustard greens.  I also added chinese sausage and broth for $2.24.  I was expecting the hainan chicken to be a room temperature but I was not expecting the broth to be the same temp....so that surprised me.  The rice was wonderful...fatty and silky and delicious.  The chicken was so juicy and tender...probably the best white meat chicken I've ever tasted.    My husband had the cornish game hen with salad.  The salad was phenominal...the greens were fresh and crispy and it had tons of fresh toppings like pomegranite arils, avocado, tomatoes, cucumber, kale, etc.  and came already dressed with the most delicious sesame dressing. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked too long.  It was dry and almost black on the bottom.  I felt like I was in that christmas vacation movie where they are all chewing on that dry-ass turkey and trying to choke it down with water.    Next time I will try the fried chicken bao and I'll definitely get the salad with chicken tenders."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best I have been to in a very long time!! The presentation is incredible & the food tastes even better. I constantly crave the salad with the chicken tenders. & honestly, the words chicken tenders don't live up to how flavorful & moist their chicken is. & the salad might be the best I've ever had in my life! & I've traveled a lot. I will go to this restaurant for as long as I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing special, chicken was dry and tasteless. Place is dark can't see what we were eating.  Slow service .... won't be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best thing about my entire experience at Flock & Fowl was the appetizer. The menu was sparse, (except for alcohol- 4 pages of that) the waiter was overly pushy and the food was just okay. My sons both ordered the steak, it was listed as 9 oz. but, what was served looked more like 4 oz. and was overpriced."}
{"text":"Flock & Fowl's Hainanese Chicken Rice is just OK for me.  I thnk they need to work on their oily Hainanese Chicken Rice.  Needs more flavoring.  The chicken, too,  needs more flavors to enrich the dish.  The Hainanese Chicken Rice I've eaten while growing up in Singapore always came with sliced chunky cucumbers with dark soya sauce and cilantro.  The chili sauce is quite close to the one back home.  There's also the ginger/garlic/scallion sauce; that's something that is usually incorporated in the chili sauce.   I'm not sure why their chicken rice comes with mustard greens.  I don't remember eating that before; must be a Taiwanese influence.    Very limited seating at this restaurant.  Not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hainanese chicken happens to be one of my favorite dishes, Chinese food or not.  I was very much looking forward to coming to Flock & Fowl to experience the amazing chicken everyone keeps talking about.   My experience with this restaurant was not unpleasant but it was slightly disappointing.  The setting is nice.  Definitely belongs in the new flashy/trendy/almost hipster Downtown.  Cool decorations, a snazzy bartender wearing an apron...  The service was good.  Our server was super nice and courteous and patient.  It took a hot second for us to be seen in the first place but once we were he came by to check on us a good amount of times.  Now to the all important food....  We got the deviled eggs.  Are they supposed to be hot or cold?  Because these were lukewarm, room temperature eggs.  Not appetizing.  We also got the Kaya toast with foie gras.  While the foie was cooked superbly the toast seemed to be missing the jam.   I hadn't noticed until the next day when I opened my Instagram and saw someone else's posting.  Now to the chicken... We got both the poached and the fried.  Utter disappointment.  No balance of flavor.  All of the sauces were lackluster, most of them just being bitter.  It seems like it could be a great place and maybe we were here in an off night?"}
{"text":"My daughter ate there and got sick. Chicken was served at room temp. Food was not good at all. No flavor and down right gross. Would never go again or recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Good for something different but I just did not love it. Not their fault; just my tastes. Service was fab"}
{"text":"Searching for some good eats while in Vegas we came across Flock and Fowl. It's a cute sit down in a hipster environment. The place was packed on a Saturday during lunch but we didn't wait more than 10 mins to be seated. Upon arrival you will view the menu on the wall, place your order/pay and wait to be seated.  What sold me was the concept of the chicken + bao. I was excited to try the crispy chicken tucked between the soft bao. The contrasting textures made my tongue salivate. Unfortunately this dish fell short. Perhaps because the chicken was too big? It didn't allow the edges to get fully crispy. Also, the batter lacked some flavor. Def worth trying at least once.  We also ordered the Hainam rice with Chinese sausage. It was very rich and moist in texture. But too heavy on the soy sauce which gives it that deep brown color. We also ordered the wings in a Thai and Sriracha flavor. No worries, it wasn't spicy. It was very crispy and the sauce was thick and caramelized. My favorite dish was the salad with roasted chicken. It had 10 different ingredients and was full off veggies. The dressing was very light."}
{"text":"My first time here and I enjoyed it. The staff made me feel welcomed and like I was part of the family. I had one of your signature cocktails the Kaya toast And the poached chicken and rice. Once I mixed all of the rice the sweet Chinese sausage and the mustard greens together the flavors came together. Definitely a good place with a wonderful vibe good music and a nice crowd."}
{"text":"I liked the Sahara restaurant better.  The parking stand is often broken.  The meter maid told us to ignore it once.  Once it took 3 of our 8 quarters but still got a $20 ticket.  Restaurant not worth the hassle!"}
{"text":"I have been putting off going to this place despite its high ratings.  The Hainan Chicken was excellent.  Now I've been there twice.  The fried chicken wings were outstanding but the sausage was only so-so."}
{"text":"I headed here for the much anticipated Hainnan chicken rice. The place is in a random location and quaint. The set-up is a bit unique, as you order food first at the cash register, then grab a seat, if available.   A friend and I ordered the Hainnan chicken rice with a side of egg and Chinese sausage, the sambal chicken wings, and the bao, in addition to the salad.   Somehow, the two gentlemen who ordered their food after us were getting the exact same order of Hainnan chicken, wings, as well as the salad dish prior to us, which lead to much confusion.   We got an apology by the waitress, and then received our orders, but couldn't help but notice that the size of our chicken was 3/4 the size of the table next to us, and the wings were smaller as well. The salad portion was also significantly smaller. Side by side, it was a bit obvious.   The Hainnan chicken itself seemed like high quality chicken. The portion however is small as a trade-off. The side sauces that came with it were okay.    The sambal wings were an epic fail in flavor, and neither of us enjoyed it, even leaving a wing behind.   The salad dressing and flavor was really good and refreshing. The bao was nothing to rave about as the fried chicken inside had a mediocre crunch, texture, and flavor was unimpressive.   All in all, the price was a bit high for everything we got. The service is questionable, as there is one person running around trying to take orders and serve customers. Not only did it seem hectic, but, the waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed and anxious in general.   Just a note, there is no restroom available, so wash your handsies prior, and your bowels emptied prior to your arrival.   The question is would I return? I'm not sure as nothing was notable to me, and I have had better Hainnan chicken elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal we had this trip. This place uses free range chicken and organic ingredients and the difference is apparent. It's got a very chill and unique vibe attracting a mixture of customers. You order at the counter, take a number and sit down, they will bring you your order. This will probably become a staple on our visits."}
{"text":"The place is a small lunch spot but love the decors. Around 10 mins drive away from the Strip.  Came here cause my friend Ada told me it was delicious and if I had the time I should go and here I am right when they opened.  Sitting here sipping my iced Vietnamese coffee and eating one of the best Hainanese chicken I've had.  I got the traditional poached chicken with rice and veggies of the day was stir fried bokchoy. The dish came out with three different dipping sauces. All of them are made in house and they were all extremely delicious.  The staff is super helpful and tentative. It's always a plus.  Definitely will come back when I come visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"New spot with new menu.    Best hainan chicken I've ever had (including Singapore).  Organic chicken makes a huge different.  If you are a fan of Savoy then this will blow you away  Organic salad and craft cocktails are amazing additions"}
{"text":"Today I needed some wings, and I ran to Flock & Fowl to satisfy my craving. Their Szechuan salt and pepper wings are my favorite - they recently won an award for the best chicken wings in the Western Hemisphere. Or maybe it was Vegas? They are good enough to win both. Anyway, I had to down a big serving of Lhaksa, too, so I took the wings home and just had those doout a late night meal. I'm going back tomorrow for the Hainanese Chicken!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out because of all the reviews on the Singaporean chicken rice. It was tasty and we enjoyed it as it is impossible to find in the midwest. But we felt biased since the best we ever had we ate in Thailand at a hole in the wall spot that only served this dish. We also tried the Thai honey wings which were crispy,sticky sweet deliciousness. I would go back for those on a craving!! Also they serve fresh brewed teas and vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Food wise, Flock & Fowl is pretty good.  I went with a friend to get their signature item - boneless hainanese chicken (served at room temperature).  The chicken was super tender and flavourful and I enjoyed the side pickles and sauces that came with it.  The only reason they don't get a 5th star is just because I find the price/value ratio a bit off.  I've seen much larger portions at other places.     I also tried their bao, but I got it to go, which I don't recommend.  It might have been delicious fresh but by the time I got home the chicken was quite dry and not at all good."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. Came here because of the great reviews and left disappointed.  First of all their milk tea was all watered down and tasted more like water. Ordered their famous chicken and rice. And was told that they just ran out of rice and we would have to wait for a few minutes. How can you run out of rice when you are supposedly known for your chicken and rice? Shouldn't it be a staple? They gave us some complimentary appetizers to eat while we waited. After about 30 minutes, which surprise is how long it takes for the rice to cook, our meals came out.  Th chicken was good, very tender and not dry at all. The rice was so so, not too flavorful. The sauces were not too great or appealing either.  Overall I did not really enjoy the food here and thought the food and drinks were overpriced. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Love the food amazing put a smile on my face def can't wait to go back and enjoy another time with me and my friends and they can't see the great experience I had"}
{"text":"If you crave urban aesthetics, flavor, excellent customer service and most importantly, Chicken! Then this shop is definitely worth a try!  Their menu is compact with fusion flavors from all the items they produce! A different take to how they handle Poultry. Also, their drink menu offers a variety of refreshments!   Shouting out the staff for their knowledge and passion about their workplace. Providing awesome recommendations for first timers such as myself! No wonder regulars keep coming back! I may become one myself."}
{"text":"Very disappointed after the location change. Price raised, food quality dropped, service is very slow. And there is dust in water."}
{"text":"Came here with friends from Los Angeles, this is hands down the best hainan chicken I have had. It was flavorful and juicy. I have had Savoy in Los Angeles and thought it was good, but this place blows it out of the water. Definitely a gem in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I was craving hainanese chicken really bad and found this place. Very tasty with large portions! I would probably share everything. Don't forget to get the egg!"}
{"text":"Downtown Vegas is always crazy, loud and hiding great treasures if you venture off Fremont street. And off that beaten path you will stumble upon Flock and Fowl. Grab yourself a seat and enjoy! Joel at the bar will walk you through the menu with all it's Asian flavors. Then quench your thirst with one of his signature cocktails or perhaps your looking for an old favorite with a new spirit currently only available in Nevada.  Don't drink? No problem they have a great selection of teas. My favorite, chrysanthemum, the delicate white flowers create a naturally sweet mild tea. Sooo good. Want something stronger? Againnnn No Problem their Green Teas or Oblong selection  can match the request. The food is wonderful. All the flavors blending spectacularly to awake your tastebuds to familiar spices with new twist.  Try: .... ummm EVERYTHING... We tasted most of the menu and it was all amazing!! We didn't want to stop eating!!  You could find yourself in a lively conversation at the bar or participating in one of their special events and toasting with new friends. This spot is Amazing!!  Whether you come here to treat yourself or bringing a date or perhaps just looking for a new spot to hang with friends you have come to one of Vegas's hidden gem!  All I can say (if I haven't said it already) Go!!!  Go!! What are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant based on my daughter 's recommendation. She's actually right! The food was good and the service was fast. We ordered the Hainan Chicken, the traditional and roasted kind. Both were delicious and tasted homemade. We also ordered the chicken wings, one buttered and one fried. They're equally delicious! The atmosphere was pleasant and this location is easy to get to. Another must go back to restaurant!"}
{"text":"Finally able to try this place out. Every table in the small restaurant was taken, so we got takeout. We got one of their famed poached chicken and a roasted half hen. Found out when the next customer ordered that we were lucky and got the last poached chicken avail for the next hour. It was 1pm, and yes, they sell out early and often.   Poached was definitely better, moist, and accentuated with the 3 sauces they provide. The accompanying rice was quite flavorful. I enjoyed the meal, but I'm kind of mystified by all the media and blogging hype. Yes, it's good, but any decent china town in the country (including LV) will have comparable. Maybe it was the plastic fork and knife that affected my experience."}
{"text":"So simple, yet so good!   The chicken here is pretty close to perfection. It's slippery and juicy with yummy skin.  Served with rice that was cooked in the chicken broth (a little too salty for my taste) and with 3 great sauces. Everything on the plate was clearly made with love.   I'd also recommend splurging and getting the lap cheung sausage as well because who doesn't love sausage?   My only complaints are: 1. Location - weird place and restaurant is too small 2. Price - I get it, the chicken is organic and farmed in CA....but I could prob get hainan chicken rice for 1/2 the price in chinatown 3. Hours - seriously? you close at 3pm?!?!?!? sadface...."}
{"text":"Simple put: the best alternative to fast food in Las Vegas, same prices, but made to order."}
{"text":"I had lunch recently with friends at Flock & Fowl, which from what I have read of the few reviews posted at the time, is all about their authentic preparation of Hainan Chicken Rice.  The restaurant is on a small stripmall lot on Sahara, and very close to Las Vegas Blvd and SLS.  I can see parking potentially be a problem, but there should be plenty of street parking on the side street.  It is a very small restaurant with very limited seating, so if you plan to go during your lunch break, go early and beat the crowd. Or expect to wait or have it prepared as a takeout.  So what exactly is Hainan Chicken Rice, aka Hainanese Chicken Rice (????)? It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore, and is very popular in Vietnam and Thailand as well.  But it is based on a dish called Wen Chang Chicken (???) from the Southern Chinese province of Hainan (??).  And each country that adapted this popular and tasty dish from early Chinese immigrants from Hainan put their own regional spin on it.  I have tried a few variations already (Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore), and as long as the chicken is cooked and still moist, it is already considered good by my book.  The variation prepared and served at Flock & Fowl is one of the better ones for sure.  The chicken is moist and paired well with the fluffy white rice cooked with chicken fat (this might be the first time I have tried this variation, as I am more accustomed to the rice being cooked with chicken broth, which gives it more chicken flavor) and the homemade sambal chile sauce and the ginger scallion sauce.  For diners looking for a simple and healthful meal option, this is definitely a good choice.  Additional add-ons are available, such as egg and chinese sausage, which I think will make your dining experience even better.  Even though Flock & Fowl is a small restaurant with a very modest number of tables and seats (I counted about 20), with a very small menu of 3-5 items, it should still be on every Yelper's radar of places to try.  I really enjoyed my experience at Flock & Fowl, and I think you will too."}
{"text":"I came in alone. I was in a sorta foul mood and found myself in the area. A little restaurant the size of a cafe in the middle of a run down looking strip mall on the northern side of Sahara at Industrial. Inside, the vibes were chill and I noticed the tea selection and minimal decor.  Jenny took care of me. She was great, always moving in earnest, showing great concern for her guests' experience. Paid up front and waited patiently yet hungrily for my food.  Every time the food is brought out, Jenny tells her guest a bit about it. I got the Hainan Chicken - 1\2 dark and 1/2 white Free range chicken from a ranch in San Wakeen, CA...sliced and deboned; three types dipping sauce (dont remember names, but garlicky, sweet/salty, and spicy); and rice fried in chicken fat.   It felt like I was on a date and forming an intimate relationship with this chicken that was laid on front of me. I listened to songs by Marvin Gaye and John Legend playing softly in the back as I contemplated how to dip and dress this most savory and moist chicken.  TL:DR Great chicken. Awesome food. 11/10 Would eat again and brining friends to start the Flock & Fowl chicken cult."}
{"text":"great lunch spot!  we came in on our 1 hour lunch break and it was plenty of time to order and enjoy our meals.  I ordered the chicken tenders with rice and added the broth and an egg. The tenders were delicious, with a light crispy batter on the outside. I liked the ginger sauce best. Rice was awesome, I definitely reached my carb intake for the day here lol. My friends ordered the hen with salad and the Indonesian fried rice.  The teas were really good as well. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable. A good amount of the menu is organic- huge plus.  We left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"One of the few places that serve hainan / hainanese chicken in town. This is their 2nd and newest location but what makes them great is that they are open until 10pm. Their first location on Sahara is only open until 3pm.   We ordered their fries and eggrop soup as an appetizer.  Fries were good, they were season curly fries style with a special mayo dipping.   The egg drop soup was super salty but our awesome server Troy gave us plain chicken broth to dilute the saltiness and helped reheat the soup.  We had the regular poached hainan chicken and the fried hainan chicken.  I still prefer the regular poached. The fried one was good but batter is pretty thick, and fried heavy.   Anyways what made this experience 5 star was our waiter Troy. He was very nice, caring, and attentive.  Best waiter in town."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the crazy parking lot, this place is delicious. Despite its tiny size, Flock & Fowl packs a lot of flavor.   I've only eaten the salad here (trying to keep it light) and I'm never disappointed. Everything is fresh, flavorful, and in season. I like that every time I order the salad it's a little different. Keeps my tastebuds interested. The chicken is very good, moist and flavorful.   Service is always fine, all of the staff are friendly and helpful.  If you want to come here during peak lunch time, I suggest calling ahead and taking your food to go, there are only a handful of tables here. This is not the lunch spot where you can chill and catch up with friends. Also, food can sometimes come out slowly due to the busyness so if you don't call ahead be prepared to wait a while.   Flock & Fowl has limited business hours so be sure to check ahead of time (they're closed on Mondays!)."}
{"text":"How have I not yet written a review for Flock & Fowl!? Situated in a very unassuming strip mall very close to the strip on Sahara, Flock & Fowl always serves up excellent chicken dishes with a smile. Every dish is hand-crafted simplistic perfection. Less is more is the name of the game here. The menu is not extensive but that's the beauty of it. Sheridan focuses on making each dish beautiful, delicious and impactful. I'm always excited for every new venture of his and look forward to the new location opening up in DTLV very soon as well."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Jenny, the owner helped us.  She's very proud of her place and was running around helping like she was 3 people.  Place was standing room only during lunch and no one was unhappy about it.  Simple ingredients done well.  Expect a wait for a table during peak lunch.  Food is ready pretty quickly for to go.  Look for Golden Steer and work your way west in parking lot to find this gem."}
{"text":"Thank the food gods I found this place, A little slice of heaven off the strip!   The atmosphere was super pleasant, with a caring team that wants you to be happy and fed well.  I highly recommend the Hainanese chicken rice w/ poached chicken and Thai caramel chicken wings  Every component of the rice was perfectly done, combining into a symphony of deliciousness. I know that sounds absurd but it's really really good with seemingly simple ingredients. I put everything together and it was awesome.  The chicken wings were stellar.   Only regret is that I didn't get egg in my rice!"}
{"text":"Super cutty!! But places like this in Vegas are few and far between. Good food, reasonable priced.  Fried chicken wings are so-so, bao are good but not spectacular. The stand out items are the chicken and rice obviously, fried chicken sandwich, and the flock and fowl salad! Limited seating in this small place make taking orders to go a good idea. Take out through online app only it seems. NO BABY CHAIRS."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously overrated.  The salad I ordered was wilted and not tasty. The famous chicken was nothing special. There are so many better Asian cuisine places in Las Vegas. Will not come back."}
