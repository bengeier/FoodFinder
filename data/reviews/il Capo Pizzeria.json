{"text":"Outstanding and friendly service, delicious food!  Love it here and our favorite bartender!"}
{"text":"Went to check this place out, as it sounded interesting...  Sat outside on the patio, not to many people there.   Someone came over and said they would be back.  20 minutes later it was the same woman.  She \"forgot about us\" she said...  The pizza was ok, the antipasto was not good at all.    The pizza came out first, it was cold, then meatballs and salad.  

It is in the same spot as the Gelato Spot.    Bring back the Gelato!  There are several other places like this in the area.  They won't last in my opinion."}
{"text":"If there is a place to go for pizza and a salad, it's here. Always delivers on fresh ingredients, as well as service. Family owned so you can tell they care. I've been here easily 20 times and have left happy every single time. Love the \"Boss\", \"Diavolo\", and \"Fig and prosciutto\" pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to give this place 5 stars but couldn't begin to pull the trigger.  The food is worthy of it, but the service and atmosphere insists that I kick it down a notch.  Sorry!

The pizza was fantastic.  I ordered The Boss and it was huge.  Crust was wonderful and ingredients were abundant and fresh.  It tasted great and the texture was awesome.  Really just a wonderful Za.  We also ordered the pear salad which was fantastic.  We saw other orders coming out and they all looked equally as special.  The slices available for a quick grab and go looked great too.  

But the acoustics were horrible.  I couldn't carry on a conversation once a few people got there after their movie got out.  I couldn't even understand the waitress when she was explaining something about the gelato.  She was new, so I don't wanna rattle the cage too much but after our pizza came she was overly occupied with small talk with other tables it seemed.  The place is small, so there can't be more than 20 tables but she seemed a little overwhelmed.  Plus, the tables are way too close.  Another couple came in and sat down next to us and I felt as though I was obligated to have a conversation with them.  That's too close.  

Lastly, that darned Western exposure is a killer at dusk and between having the sun glaring in our faces, the couple almost on top of us and the fact that we couldn't hear ourselves over the rest of the noise in the place really undid so much of the quality that we would've enjoyed otherwise.

But if you want a great pizza, I'd have to say that this is on the top of the list.

I hope that they can cozy it up a little bit and put some padding on the ceiling or something.  If I was in a comfy booth facing away from the sun I think that it would have been there.  Right now I am just happy that I've got 3 slices left over for the week!!!"}
{"text":"IL Crapo!  This was disgusting, cold over cooked veal, pizza was burnt, salad missing DRESSING and other ingredients.  Terrible!!!!  We left hungry and out $60 as the table next to us felt the same about their IL Crapo food.  We told the manager and he smiled and said sorry.  Don't waste your time or money, Guidos is right around the corner and Oreganos across the street."}
{"text":"It is a great NY family pizza restaurant. One of my favorite spots to eat. The Italian meals are excellent, I typically get Eggplant Parmesan with a side of Broccolini and two slices, or the special of the day. If you are a wine lover ... Half price wine bottles on Wednesdays. I notice a lot of people are repeat customers which says a lot in itself."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would.... The waitress was very nice, got our drinks right away. Waited about an hour for the food, and decided it was unacceptable that we waited that long. We asked for the owner, who came out and was very rude. We complained about how it was taking a while for the food, and he started yelling about how he had other things going on in the back and couldn't deal with us. He continued to say, he didn't want our service at all. We offered to pay for our drinks and he said he doesn't even want our money. DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant today and we will definitely be back! 

The gourmet pizza by the slice sold my husband immediately as he knew we would be eating in minutes. The crust was perfect, sauce/ cheese ratio perfect and flavors were delicious. We got three different slices - lemongrass chicken, eggplant, and the grandmas something. It tasted like pizza I've only been able to enjoy in Italy. Worth the trip to eat in so you can too enjoy authentic and incredibly good pizza!

We also got the roasted pear salad which was fantastic. It was a bit sweet for my taste but hubbs thought it was perfect.

Excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome atmosphere. Wonderful bartender. Tried the sea salt gelato, garlic knots and Grandma's pizza. Also, they have local State 48 beer. The Amber Ale is great. Too many things to try tonight, will have to keep comming back."}
{"text":"We tried some place new for pizza night. No kids menus for coloring  Food was good. Nice outdoor patio, we will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a snack on our way to the movies.  We were pleasantly surprised!  The garlic knots were amazing and the thin crust pizza the best I've had in a long time!  Be sure to sit at the bar and have a bubblino or two when Antonia is working, she is sure to make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Cesar salad w homemade croutons to start and 12 inch cheese pizza.  So good.  Thank goodness for yelp for those of us who travel a lot.  I have found so many good restaurants this way.  This place is no exception!  Nice little patio too.  Great place to come before a movie- theatre is right across the parking lot.  Great service Marianne!"}
{"text":"THANK you IL CAPO!  usually get food to go but have often said we should eat on their lovely patio, but when we stopped, the patio was SO full and the weather was perfect we planned on returning, we decided to stay and eat at the bar.  I had my girls with me and realize kids at the bar are not liked, but the bartender seemed warm and welcoming.....I had my salad great as always and my girls had a some pizza and pasta. Food took a little while, but they were busy. Get it. The lady at the front was helpful, the guy who brought our food was sweet the bartender had great recommendations moreover she was so good with my girls, they want to go back and see her. That matters warm food warm service. Thanks il capo"}
{"text":"Being an ex Staten Islander, living in AZ for 20 plus years, finding a credible NY pizzeria and restaurant was a top priority for me. 

ENTER MARIO RANA and his killer staff, like Marianne, James, John or Nick, you will quickly feel at home of you are from the big apple or appreciative of fine Italian Food and the best Pizza in Scottdale. 

Strongly recommend the Grandma slice and the off the menu Chicken Piccata. Ssshhhh!"}
{"text":"From NY & know a good pizza, Caesar salad & spaghetti & meatballs.  Not here.
The pizza crust was crispy on the outside, however it got soggy toward the middle.  The sauce had very little flavor, it needed some garlic, basil, oregano, salt & pepper.  
Salad was pretty mediocre with very little parmesan. And the spaghetti & meatballs was most disappointing.  My son said the meatballs were like mystery meat.  He didn't finish, which is not something he ever does, usually wants seconds & thirds.
The waiter seemed like he was 12 & had no knowledge of the menu whatsoever.
He described a dessert that came out totally different.  We asked for chocolate cake, he brought us brownies with pistachio ice cream.
I will try it again, just because it is close & I can't eat at Pita Jungle more than once or twice a week.  
I hope the staff gets tighter the sauce gets more flavorful."}
{"text":"Chef was nice and accommodating, service was timely and kind.... He was right there asking me if  I needed something before I realized I did! Thank you John and Jared. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars, I would, as one is too high. At first, my boyfriend and I loved this place. We made it a point to go eat at the restaurant every weekend. Then, one weekend night, we decided to order delivery for the first time. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni, bacon, and garlic calzone. We received a SALAMI, bacon, and garlic calzone.  We called the restaurant to let them know and after explaining over 10 times what we thought was a simple mistake, they finally said they would remake the calzone. Not five minutes later, the manager calls my cell phone and starts arguing with me!! Telling me I am wrong and that the salami isn't in the pizza station so there was no way there could be salami in the calzone, as I'm standing there looking at and tasting the salami right in front of me. I'm in shock as to how a manager of such a nice establishment would ever think it was okay, in any way, to sit and argue with a customer. After first making this our weekend date spot, we will no longer be returning our business to such a place. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Date night success at il capo. Service was fast, food was delicious and the atmosphere was laid back. We enjoyed and highly recommend the lasagna and the carbonara. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I am so happy that my family and I tried this cute, little place. The service alone was superb, I think we were greeted by just about everyone who was there that night! With the weather being so beautiful, we sat on the patio. It was clean and enjoyable, which is a big deal for me as I'm not a big fan of eating outside! 

We started with some beers and garlic knots. The beers were good, but the knots were a bit overdone. Still OK, just not the best. But, that's fine, because it's the pizza that got me hooked!!

My husband ordered the meatball pizza, and I the Diavolo. There. Are. No. Words. That little devil was incredible! The spice, the flavor, the crust! I'm eating the leftovers now, and I'm still so happy. The meatball pizza was also very good! We left satisfied and will return again!"}
{"text":"First time here and the service was phenomenal! Friendly, quick and the pizza was great. We got the Vegetarino Pizza and it tasted so good! We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"5 Stars for customer service. I was contacted by the owner to remedy a bad experience. We tried an 18 inch Pepperoni and I will say this was much more what I was expecting. The crust was cooked nicely, NY Style, not to crispy or doughy. Unlike our first experience, the cheese was fantastic! I would now say I would recommend il Capo and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh Gosh, so good.  Sicilian pizza slice \"grandma's\" AKA \"nonna's\" is great!!!  I'm Italian born in the US but grew up with FOB Italians and ate authentic Italian food all my life.  This is so good here.  Support a good place that uses high quality ingredients: grande mozzarella cheese (the best, trust me I used to manage a great pizzeria), San Marzano tomatoes from Italy . . . These items are expensive!!! But the prices charged for their pizzas and pastas are reasonable.  Promise I'm just an enthusiastic guest, not family.  Been here three times and all were perfect.  The cioppino tonight with squid ink tagliellini is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I suspect this is a place that gets better the more you drink and the later it gets. I stopped in at 3:30am and got a slice to go. I wasn't drunk but it was late and although the slice looked pathetic it tasted just fine. The price was right though so I didn't feel like I got ripped off. They have a good variety in the menu so I'll likely be back at least one more time to test some more of the options. Staff were friendly and seating area was clean, bathroom was ready for a good cleaning but not disgusting. It's a one person at a time so it could be a wait if you need to use it. This is definitely a late night place so if the food impresses I'll be adding a star soon."}
{"text":"Awesome family owned Italian place! Service and food were excellent. Did not have to wait long for our food but yet so fresh with the homemade marinara sauce that is to die for. Great Happy Hour prices, and a good beer/wine/spirits selection. Will definitely be back. Nice to not be in a typical Scottsdale uptight fufu restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The best pizza I've had in Arizona. The crust is perfect. Thin,  flaky, yet crisp. Had the diavolo pizza, spicy and ricotta cheese balanced it out. Pear salad was great. Will be returning soon for sure!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for true authentic Italian food/pizza you need to visit this spot! Not only is the food outstanding but so is the ambiance, serving staff, and drinks. They have a great wine and beer selection including a great paring of craft cocktails with some of their meals."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, but ridiculously small portions for what you pay. Fritto Misto was $14 for 2 shrimps and maybe 10 pieces of calamari. $11 salad wouldn't fill a soup bowl. Not sure if dining in is better, but don't think I'll try."}
{"text":"My family was in town for a reunion of sorts and we came here with a rather large group of 11 people, including one toddler and two babies. Our waiter handled the large group with great attention and attitude. The food was also great - several of us had one of the daily special pastas, a squid ink tagliatelle with seafood. Excellent! We had just had pizza two nights before so we didn't order it, but theirs looked and smelled amazing."}
{"text":"We like to come in on \"Winesday\" and sit up at the bar with Antonia.  She always remembers us and is so personable.  She offers perfect suggestions for both the wine list and specials of the day. It's so refreshing to go to a place where the bartender actually takes time with you and doesn't rush you through - even when it's a busy seating time.  Try the Boss pizza...so good."}
{"text":"We were new in town. Found il capo pizzeria on Yelp. Pizza was very good. Fresh and delicious. John was very nice and polite. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and Italian food from a great local family. The crust on the wood fired pizza was amazing. Really happy to have you in the hood!

Beer selection is really good too."}
{"text":"Great fresh food at reasonable prices. A very friendly neighborhood  restaurant with excellent service and delicious food, just ask for Jimmy as your waiter."}
{"text":"il Capo (The Boss) finally does what the entire Valley Of The Sun has failed to do for the past 12 years I've lived here....make a kick-ass pizza!  The owner is from New York and he knows NY pie top to bottom.  Crust is perfect, the blend of cheeses are right on the money, no skimping on poor quality pepperoni, and best of all the sauce is the without equal.  When you bite into a slice you don't taste crust, sauce, cheese and toppings, you taste a whole, perfectly put together pizza!  

We ordered the 18\" NY pie and between my friend and I we took the whole thing down.  Been back 3 times in the past 2 weeks already.  Mary Ann is our afternoon/lunch server and she makes us feel like veteran patrons of the place.

There won't be any shaving off stars for the environment because it is very pleasant.  Clean, quiet and laid out nicely so as not to feel too crowded or cramped.  Personally I'd change the decor up to a nice 70's pizza parlor style with wood paneling, red plastic pizza cups, pinball machines and carpeting.  Maybe even a raised area where you could put a band on Friday and Saturday nights.  If not then I'd settle for a jukebox, but the music could only go up to 1981...'83 tops.

To me il Capo should rename themselves The Boss because that's what they are.  I'll be there every week until I can't eat anymore or if for some reason they decide to try to keep up with the ridiculous trends of specialty pizza's with dumb sauces like fire roasted tomatoes or a \"white\" sauce.

Long live il Capo!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there Sunday the 25th. Excellent pizza. We had the Napoli , Crispy ribs and the fried rice ball with marinara sauce also as starters .  Best Kansas city ribs ever.  Rice ball was unexpectently delicious. Nice casual atmosphere. Friendly staff.  The Italian beer on tap is a must with the pizza."}
{"text":"What a charming restaurant! After receiving horrible customer service from Pita Jungle next door, our group decided to try Il Capo and we were not disappointed! 

Their staff was so accommodating and the food was delicious. Prices are reasonable and our orders were accurate and prompt.  We are already making plans to return"}
{"text":"Amazing staff but the best part of eating hete is the service at the bar. Toni is not only a great bartender but also one of the kindness people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I love the food I personally come twice a week."}
{"text":"The ribs fell off the bone and were exceptional. The pizza was great and every bite the Stromboli was awesome. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Went back today to give it another shot. Had the eggplant parm sandwich, one if the best I've had. It was recommended by John the first time I was there, unfortunately he was not there the last time. Service does make a difference and he is very knowledgeable about the food there and also makes you feel comfortable and appreciated. Will definitely go back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Great service, family atmosphere, authentic Italian. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. Best wood fired pizza around this area.  Very friendly staff and half priced bottles of wine on Wednesdays. Pasta is homemade. Small bar area and restaurant but food is amazing. Nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Thanks to the recommendation the Smoke Tree resort we found this restaurant. Very good food easy parking. Trevor is a very joyful waiter and added to the enjoyment of our meals."}
{"text":"I am stay at The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch and was given the name of this restaurant as a good place to order from and have delivered. It took an hour and a half my food was cold and I ordered cheese cake that looked like maybe it had been tossed back and fourth between people for about 15 minutes before it was delivered to me. The meal was $28 dollars for cold Posta Alfredo, garlic cheese toast, cheese cake, Coke, $3 dollar delivery fee plus a $5 dollar tip on top of that. I would have left off if I would have know the food out come. The best part of the restaurant was the lady that took my order; if I had not paid cash I would have cancelled my order. Laura Dale 210 E Del Rio Dr. Tempe, AZ. 85282"}
{"text":"I will be short and sweet.  The pizza at Il Capo is the very best I've had since leaving NYC 15 years ago.  We often have the pizza with anchovies, a brutal test of any pizzeria.  Il Capo passes with flying colors."}
{"text":"This restaurant receiving a 4 star rating makes me rethink my religious use of yelp before choosing a restaurant. I must say, my wife and I were quite disappointed. She ordered the beet salad that was supposed to have goat cheese, but there was barely any to be had. I ordered the Lupara, and it was quite bland. It wasn't bad, but it just didn't do much. I was expecting so much more with the rating being what it was. This will definitely be a one and done for us. On to the next..."}
{"text":"Bartender shame! I really have enjoyed this place until tonight when the bartender call my best friends \" queens\" not knowing anything about them. Totally inappropriate and disrespectful!!   Get some class and tolerance. Bartender, Please continue to boast yourself as the girlfriend of the Owners son...I only hope they are ashamed of your verbiage. On another note, appreciate that you told my catholic friend celebrating lent, \"she wouldn't know the difference\" in meat or not. Thank you for offending a multitude of religion and sexual preferences.... Shame shame shame on you."}
{"text":"I wanted Sooo Much to Like this New Place. I love the location and the outdoor dining. Hopefully their food will improve. 

I loved the menu and planned to make this my new regular restaurant. They even offer gluten free pasta (spaghetti). Then I ate there and my plans changed. 

Starting with the wine list- they should scrape it and start over. This is Scottsdale and people here expect sonething drinkable. They were not even that cheap- $8-12. The best I can sayfor the Montepulciano is that it was tasteless. I sent one back- the first time in my life I ever sent back a wine. I ordered the Malbec that they recommended.  Cheap crap All Malbecs are inexpnsive- why not buy a better one? Anyway I left it there, untouched. 

Food- I wanted to love this restaurant because they offer orecchiette with broccolini and sausage. This happens to be my favorite Italian dish but no Scottsdale restaurants carry it. The orecchiette are hand made here- about 18-1/4 inch think pasta- just think about that. I took a picture- they are the size and shape and consistency of a babies' ear. A good choice for Halloween but a disappointment the rest of the year. I had to send them back because they were big, fat, and cold.

My husband had a nice sized portion of lasagne. Also cold. reheated frozen food but they didn't heat it up enough. Better afterwe sent it back and they nuked it. It has a nice flavored sauce. 

So- bad wine, cold food, 

So much for them becoming my weekly special place. But I'll try them again in about 6 months and see if they hired someone who knows Italian food/ and or/ how to cook.  I love the location."}
{"text":"The chopped salad was very good. My daughter had the chicken parm. Cooked perfectly, great sauce. Garlic knots went well with both. Sat on the patio. Waiter was awesome. Had our golden with us.  The waiter brought him a bowl of water. Didn't even have to ask. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza!!! And the gelatto is amazing!! Great atmosphere and excellent food."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place; great pizza and happy hour too. If you get takeout though, the Oreochitte is good, but barely covered a third of the to go container.

That stinks because i think it was the most expensive pasta dish on the menu. May want to inspect your takeout prior to leaving.

Don't like being squeezed, so most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night but, the service was horrible.  Took forever to be seated, and there were open tables.  Was told NO at least three times when asked about menu possibilities.  Unfortunate in-restaurant experience given I've had delivery and take out that was amazing."}
{"text":"This is my second review  on yelp the first one was on a shoe repair place that was terrible!!!  But I liked  Il capo.   They gave us free garlic knots just for checking in.  Which were very good ! We came in at happy hour so we sampled a meatball, and the fried ribs. Both good , also had a slice of white pizza very good , and then we had the pizza divolo  good not the best"}
{"text":"The food and the service at this place are 
outstanding. This is our second visit and we enjoyed dinner on the patio. Our server Jonathan was attentive but not intrusive,  knowledgeable and very friendly.  The cheeseboard was overloaded with meats and cheeses, and make sure you get the garlic knots they are worth the calories."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place & usually with first visit to pizza places I order a slice or small happy hour special to see if it suits my taste. If good, will patronize regularly & try more of the menu. Had a beer at the bar & decided on a small pizza to go; oops, happy hour pizzas not available to go. OK, no problem since they have an express section for slices to go. Girl taking the slice orders is talking on the phone; shouldn't be a problem as more employees  than patrons on this past Friday at approx 4:30 pm. Waited for a reasonable time while she talked on phone & no one else came to take over, therefore I left minus my slice of il Capo pizza never to return. * Beer was good as well as the bartender."}
{"text":"I like a good local place, especially when the owner is sitting right across from you on a Tuesday night. Great spot when heading to the movies! Service is good, music is fun, food is pretty good. I like the ever-changing \"Hippy Rolls\" - mini calzones filled with goodness - perfect snack size. Meatballs are really good. Pizza needs some more flavor - love wood-fired crust, but sauce needs a spice kick. Gelato is delish!"}
{"text":"The smell brought us in while on our way to another restaurant... stopped us both dead in our tracks  
The food was delicious ... must order garlic knots and Bolognese! 
Meat balls are of generous \"Italian\" proportion !"}
{"text":"I have loved this restaurant and have rated it 5 stars in the past. Over the last 8 months it has deteriorated to the point that I will never return or have take out. (So sorry, Antonia and Maryann, I will miss you!) Tonight we ordered delivery. A slice of grandma's Sicilian was not only burnt, but barely a quarter of an inch thick. They totally lost their ability to make it right. I ordered eggplant parm dinner that was overcooked and mushy, but the worst part was the extra ricotta cheese on the side. It used to be rich and flavorful and I would bathe in if if I could...Not any more! This was made from part skim and chalky and SPOILED! Literally! It's bad!! WTF!! So, sayonara IL Capo. Too bad the owner won't listen."}
{"text":"This place has become a regular dinner spot. The delicious food and incredible service keep us coming back for more. The calamari is a must get appetizer, it's seriously tasty. We have had several pastas and one of the pizzas and there are absolutely no complaints. It's all come out quickly and is piping hot."}
{"text":"Best NY Style Pizza in the valley hands down! Garlic knots are amazing. And they do personal pies, NY style pies and by the slice, and a great craft beer selection. And get the gelato. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Great place for a first date. The owner Mario and his staff definitely know how to treat their guests. The food was amazing, and as authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"I have to say we were pleasantly surprised.  I believe this place was much smaller and just ok, so not sure if there has been an ownership change.

Had a margarita pizza for the kids and it tasted great.  Crust was perfect, sauce was flavorful, there was a good amount of basil, and the kids almost finished a large.  We had pasta too, and I would especially recommend the rigatoni with vodka sauce - probably the best pasta a la vodka we've ever had!

Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has always been a favorite place. We just discovered il Capo during our last \"Pita visit\", so decided to try it last week.

In a sentence, we loved il Capo. The decor is informal but fun, the outside patio area will be a superb hangout when the weather cools a bit, and the staff was both attentive and helpful. 

The mussel appetizer was awesome, the wine selection is solid and happy hour pricing was a complete bonus. We both ordered pizza's, which were fabulous and took a 'to-go' box home.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Well I have finally found the best NY style Pizza in Town.
The Pizza crust is thin & cooked perfectly! The sauce is tangy and is seasoned nicely. Yes this is the best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!!~ Great venue and food was delicious."}
{"text":"Pizza look good, but the crust was very tuff and was a little bit undercooked.The pizza sauce was very flavorful.  The chicken Parmesan had no flavor. The rollwas very tough and I could not bite through without the sandwich falling apart. The chicken lacked flavor And was pretty much tasteless.  The delivery driver was fast and courteous."}
{"text":"Looking for a place that would serve up a good fettucini carbonara cause I saw it on the Food Channel and you know how that goes---it gets into your head and you just gotta have it.  So surfing Yelp  for \"fettucini carbonara,\" IL CAPO PIZZERIA  popped up.  Lots of reviews, lots of good ratings.  A few low ones here and there but that happens even to a \"good\" place.  Trusting fellow Yelpers,  I trotted my family to IL CAPO's Scottsdale location on Shea across from the Harkins Theatre and steps away from the now infamous \"Amy's Baking Company\" which was featured on Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.  
We were seated outdoors--perfect --as the evening itself was perfect weather wise.  
Menus came promptly and I, of course, didn't really need a menu because I was fixated on getting the fettucini.  Isn't it terrible when you watch food shows and then you either have to cook what you saw or go out for it?  Isn't that psychological manipulation of some sort?  Food has a strong hold on all of us and that fettucini dish was definitely floating in my head.  So guess what I ordered??? Yup.

We also ordered the margarita pizza and a special sandwich.  Why do I call it special?  Because hubby doesn't do anything simple or anything that is on the menu as is.  Here is the special sandwich as he described it to the waiter.
\" You know how you have a chicken parmagiana sandwich?  Well I want the chicken with sauce and NO cheese.  You know how you have an eggplant parmagiana sandwich?  Well I want the eggplant on the chicken with NO cheese.  And... could you put Fra Diavolo sauce on it? \" That's the special sandwich.  The waiter wrote everything down and later came back to offer red pepper flakes in lieu of the fra diavolo sauce which they did not carry.  It's nothing more than a spicy marinara sauce.  I'm surprised they don't make it considering so many people are into the hot pepper scene.  
The fettucini arrived just as I had dreamed it would.  Cheesy fettucini with pancetta and peas.  Lovely looking dish and lovely tasting.  I added black pepper to it as dishes with parmagiana cheese are complemented by pepper.  I added a dash of salt but that's just me.  I thought it needed it.  The margarita pizza came out as a thin crusted pizza, clearly made in a wood-fired oven as evidenced by the charring on the edges.  A tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella (although not too generous with that) and some basil leaves.  A good pizza, not a great pizza.  Definitely needed more cheese.  
And now for the special sandwich.  Hubby noted that the bread was too short for the chicken and eggplant inside it.  On the other hand, one could say that the generosity of the chicken & eggplant dwarfted the bread.  No, let's say the former.  The bread was cut too short for the sandwich.  So like a champ, hubby sucked it up and had less sandwich than he is used to.  He added hot pepper flakes (in lieu of the sauce they didn't have) and he ate his sandwich peacefully.  I noted that there were a few pieces of ziti (or rigatoni) on the plate with the sandwich.  A taste of pasta.  Nice touch.  We cleaned our plates and now time for the check.  
The check arrived and as I reviewed it, I saw an item that read, \"OPEN FOOD\".   I queried to those at my table about what OPEN FOOD might be.  Were they charging me for eating outdoors? Did I forget about something I ordered?  I asked Alex, our server, and he clarified OPEN FOOD.  He said the kitchen told him to add $3 for omitting the cheese and putting the eggplant and chicken on one sandwich.  Really? So let me get this straight, IL CAPO charges when you request that an ingredient be left out, such as mozzarella? Note to management:  Doesn't that save you money?   So then we get to the extra slice of eggplant.  Would that be $3?  A bit much if you ask me.  We told Alex we always order this way at other restaurants and there is no up charge.  So a $7.95 sandwich (both chicken parmagiana and eggplant parmagiana pricing)  became a $10.95 sandwich plus tax and tip for omitting mozzarella and adding a slice of eggplant.  So from hubby's perspective he would rather go to his old Italian standby  that makes this sandwich with a smile and with no up- charge.  Wouldn't you?"}
{"text":"Love this place- great with my kids for a slice of pizza. They are really accommodating to families. We went early around 5:30 and they still had happy hour. My kids had a 12' cheese pizza for I think $7. The garlic knots are really delicious, just make sure everyone you go with has a bite so everyone smells like garlic together."}
{"text":"Delicious meatballs and gelato. New York style pizza. Great happy hour. Service was very standard/average. Not bad. But not great."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. The ambiance is great and the food is so incredibly good. My new fav!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Great service! Pizza is awesome. Also the strawberry kiwi wine float is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really awesome and garlicky just the way I like it! Can't wait to try it again!! They were very nice from taking the initial order to the delivery. All around thumbs up from our crew. We ordered a pizza with a slight substitution- I would have liked more goat cheese but it still had awesome flavor. Ordered ribs and meatballs they were delicious. Garlic knots can go wrong."}
{"text":"Another GREAT dining experience last night! I love their Pizza. They offer both wood fired pizza and New York style oven pizza. Both are excellent. We usually get the New York style. A delicious selection of ingredients to choose from, thinner crust, perfect sauce and aged cheese. Plus, with a drizzle of olive oil, perfection. The large 18\" is perfect for two or three, especially if you want some to take home. We usually split their Caesar salad, which is never over dressed, with perfect dressing, and, they split it in the kitchen, always a nice touch. They have a complete Italian menu, not just pizza ( which is also available by the slice). A full bar is also available. We have never gotten to desert, being too full, but, maybe next time. They have a large outside patio, too. Now to the staff and owners. What a friendly, professional group. You really feel welcome...A definite winner here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and salad. Thanks to Andrew for the great service! Hope to see you soon!"}
{"text":"If you want slap your mom good pizza & great service, you need to visit this place!! 

Found this spot on yelp. I'm sooooo glad I came ! I'm from NY so great pizza isn't hard to find....tonight I must say I tasted the best pizza EVER!!!! 

We had the Boss pizza (pepperoni, sausage,
Mushroom, roasted red pepper) with garlic knots . A-freakin Mazing ! 

The pizza was fresh and hot out the oven, crust was thin and crunchy yet moist. The sauce and cheese had the right ratio. You can tell they make their sausage in house. Heaven !!!!! 

On top of the awesome pizza we had a great server named John. He was very enthusiastic and knew the menu like the back of his hand. He made our night that much better. 

You will regret not coming here. I sure didn't."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience on Father's day that we decided to stop in again before the movies on Sunday. 

We stopped in just after 5:00, it was happy hour so the wine was $3 off and beer and cocktails were also discounted. 

We ordered a few slices and the chopped salad. The salad is so good, so many delicious flavors and dressed perfectly. They had 2 different white pies! Yum! 

We had the same waiter as last time, I can't remember his name...really nice young guy who is hoping going into the Navy Officer program. Great service. 

The owner stopped over to see how our meal was and we joked that il Capo might have to be our Sunday spot. He had mentioned the chef just brought out a fresh tiramisu for him to taste and he would love to have us try it after our meal. He brought us a complimentary tiramisu to share as a family and it was delicious. Not overly sweet, perfectly creamy and the coffee flavor was so good. 

As we were leaving, we were happy to see the restaurant was filling up. They are only a few months old and I think they will do a great business. 

(They have some pies, stromboli, garlic knots etc. ready by the kitchen and we noticed a few people come in to grab a few slices to-go. Something to keep in mind for lunch or a quick bite)."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Food was good as well. Definitely a place to go if you are looking for a lowkey happy hour session."}
{"text":"The food is great.  I love the pizza and service is average.  The only problem I have is the chairs...so very uncomfortable!  Would have given 5 stars if the chairs were comfy.  Several times I had to leave because the chairs hurt my behind, which puts a damper on the experience.  Next time I'll take a pillow"}
{"text":"Sorry to say I was disappointed in my experience last night at this restaurant. I ordered GNOCCHI BOLOGNESE - $14.95. Tasted good but I got a child's portion in a bowl. It doesn't come with anything else either ....no bread nor salad. Not enough for the price. Unbelievable. Felt so ripped off."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and top-notch cuisine. I took one bite and realized that this calzone tastes like real food. All too many pizzerias add tons of sugar and salt to their recipe which ruines any chance of making a quality product. This was propper hand-tossed dough with just the right ingredients. Il Capo makes their own fresh mozzarella in house, and their side salads are made with fresh romain lettuce; none of that wilted-pre-chopped iceberg lettuce from a bag. Just in case I have not mentioned the word \"fresh\" enough, then I say again everything on their menu is FRESH! This has just made my list of repeat localls!"}
{"text":"We ordered the home made pasta dish and the gnocchi delivered. The homemade past was not thoroughly cooked and the sauce was not seasoned, the gnocchi was bland the meal delivered with tax was over $40 we could have had a better meal with Mac and cheese $1 box with ground meat more mixed in. With all the fabulous restaurants in scottsdale we got zero on a date night. Too bad for you Il capo we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden spot in Scottsdale.  Great little restaurant for pizza and wine."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today,I was not impressed. I left with a terrible stomach ache. I ordered a glass of water it tasted like chemicals. They did bring me another glass and it was definitely sink water. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food here is always really good. The bar service is always friendly, and it is fun to try the different types of beers. I would recommend Il Capo to anyone. We've also ordered for home delivery, Duncan is friendly and professional. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a solid lunch and had the place to myself as nearly everybody had cleared out of the restaurant by 1:30pm. The slices of pizza were looking a bit lame though at that time of day, so I opted for a seat and table service. They have an all day Happy Hour menu and a free order of four knots for yelp check-in. I did enjoy the knots which were drenched in garlic and had a great marinara sauce for dipping. The main course was the $8.95 eggplant parmesan hero and this was clearly done NY style. The cutlets were nicely breaded and had a good amount of mozzarella cheese and that french bread was really good bread. There was a guy with a Yankees cap cooking in the back, so I knew I was among friends and people who can cook this kind of food properly....on this day at least."}
{"text":"Fantastic little casual stop in the Shea 14 plaza.  Counter or sit-down service, in-door or patio seating.  Nice selection of local micro-brew from State48 out of Surprise.  Wife had a great salad,  almost big enough for two.   I shared a custom 12\" pizza,  and they threw in some delicious garlic knots for checking in via Yelp.  Knots were covered in butter and garlic almost like escargo but without the snail or shell!  Will definitely come back the next time I am not craving pizza to try their other menu offer offerings."}
{"text":"We went to Il Capo for dinner last night. We ate on the patio as the evening was perfect. The service was perfect! Our waiter was amazing!  I was already sure what I was going to have but since I had some questions on some items on the menu I had not heard of but they sounded interesting. Our waiter made suggestions and I took everyone. I was not let down. Started with beers and some great wine, garlic knots and Orincetti-rice balls. Both were fantastic-the sauces were amazing!! Our waiter continued to make sure our glasses were full and checking to make sure we enjoyed our appetizers. We got 2 pies... Funghi and Diavlo.. again referral by the chef and the waiter. Both a slice of heaven! Both had such great flavor. I enjoyed the Funghi because I loved all the garlic and my friends loved the Diavlo because of the hot sausage. We all agreed we would get again.. but not until after we tried others; they have to all be just as good! Unfortunately, we were all to full to get dessert. At the end of the evening our bill was a pleasant surprise! Not any different from the 4 of us going to any other restaurant, but the quality of the meal was way better so we feel we got our moneys worth and some. I highly suggest this place and am sure you will all enjoy"}
{"text":"UPDATE: The manager contacted me and has resolved the issue. She refunded my money to me and apologized. They said it was a mix up of receipts. I'm glad they resolved this.

Original review:

These guys are CROOKS! My bill was $15 and some change with tax included. I specifically gave no tip since the service was sub part. Now my credit card statement shows a charge of over $18! I will be filing a charge back with my credit card company. WATCH OUT FOR THESE GUYS. They probably regularly overcharge people and steal money this way."}
{"text":"great pizza very good quality with reasonable prices. you can order the wood fired thin pizza or you can get the new york style pizza, or a really special one the grandma's square slice pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing food with fabulous service!! 
We will be back 4sure! 
Our waiter Timothy was great! If you haven't checked this place out yet, YOU NEED TO."}
{"text":"OMG!  I found my new fav italian place!  This place is soooooo good!  Our group decided to come here after Pita Jungle was waaaay too busy.  I am so glad we gave this place a try!  I was a little hesitant at first since it was completely dead inside, the food was amazing, the service was good and the price was right.  What else do you want?

The eggplant parmesan is the best i have ever had, i have been trying to find an eggplant parm that is just as good as the homemade stuff I have had from a friends mom.  I finally found it!  Wahoo!  I got the eggplant parm hero which was SO GOOD.  The bread that came with the sandwich was awesome too!  I am going to start telling everyone i know about this place.  

They haven't been open long so that is why it wasn't that busy.  GO NOW before this place gets cracking!"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if possible.  I've been to this restaurant twice, and the most recent time was literally the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  My girlfriend and I sit down, order an appetizer and a sausage pizza.  About 15 minutes later, our pizza was delivered mistakenly to another table a few feet away from us.  As we watch the couple touching the pizza, then taking slices from it and putting it on their plates, their server realizes that they dropped the wrong pizza and takes it back to the kitchen.  OUR server then lets us know that there was a mix up and that our pizza would be out shortly.  Unfortunately, we were watching the whole time as the other server takes back our original pizza to the kitchen (which is 5 feet away from our table and in plain view), reconfigures the slices to make it look fresh, and brings back said pizza to our table, pretending as if it were a new pizza! Not only have my girlfriend and I both worked at numerous restaurants in our lives, anyone can agree that this is COMPLETELY unacceptable, not to mention very unsanitary.  However, it gets worse.  We calmly tell the server that we saw what they did and would like a new pizza, to which they comply.  A few minutes later as our new pizza is in the oven, we ask to speak to a manager.  So the manager (who also happened to be helping the server put the old pizza back on the tray and reconfigure it) comes over, and I explain to him calmly everything that happened.  I also explained to him that obviously we should not have to pay for the pizza (common sense).  At this point the manager says, \"You were 100% right up until you started demanding things for free, so therefore the door is right there!\" 

I am honestly at a loss for words at not only how this restaurant chooses to do business and recycle food, but also how poorly we were treated by the \"manager\".  If these are the types of things they do in plain sight, with the kitchen just a few feet away from the dining room, one can only wonder what types of things go on that the guests don't see.  

I would definitely NOT recommend this restaurant, unless you enjoy getting recycled food and then being told to leave by management after making a complaint."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian spots. It is affordable, delicious and I have never encountered a wait.  I always get the orecchiette pasta, it is so good that I cant bring myself to order anything else. Also the salted caramel gelato is fantastic.  The pizzas have a nice thin crust and all the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. 

It is true that sometimes the service is not amazing. However, I have never encountered rude or inconsiderate staff, sometimes they are just a little slow and inattentive. 

Overall, my family and I always enjoy this restaurant and I will continue to visit frequently."}
{"text":"So I'm thinking to myself \"another pizza joint\".  And as I had mentioned before, Arizona isn't on my top list for good pizza.

Walked in and was instantly greeted by two things.  First a smiley bartender that was very welcoming and a beautifully decorated bar.  So far so good!

Tried their house wine which was really good and had two slices of their pizza (available either whole pie or by the slice).  First was the plain cheese pizza.  One thing I'm very particular about is the sauce.  It was to have a rich tomato taste that doesn't taste out of a can, with a bit of seasoning.  By far one of the best sauces I've tasted in the valley.  Cheese was quality and thin crust perfectly cooked.

Next was their meat/pepper slice.  Whoa did that pack a bit of heat.  Not to the point of overwhelming the pizza but had a nice kick to it.  Italian sausage was good as well (not sure if it was homemade and forgot to ask).

So of course I had to have the gelato dessert after it was described to me as \"heavenly\".  Tried the sea salt caramel that turned out to be unbelievable- I mean delicious, creamy and tasty unbelievable.  Had some other unique flavors that are next on my list to try.

Great food, service and pizza for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"We love the New York and wood fired pizza!  The pasta are good too.  Nice patio that is not in the parking lot like so many others.  The service is always hard working.  One of our regular stops."}
{"text":"Pizza was not fresh. Chicken from the chicken parm hero was rubbery. Usual cook was not there."}
{"text":"Marginal food; terrible service. Dine elsewhere. When the host seated us, he said our server would soon be with us. Soon was a relative term, apparently. When the server finally came, we ordered a bottle of wine, 50% off on Wednesdays. Server returned with bottle; no opener. Returned awhile later -- quite awhile -- with opener. Food arrived. Dropped knife. \"May we have another knife?\" We asked him.  \"Sure. Right away.\"  Another relative term. Finally, I got up, went inside to busboy and returned with knife. Then: \"Could we get two plates for our pizza?\"  Again, it'd be \"right away.\"  And again, after a considerable wait, I went inside, retrieved plates from busboy. Same story with the box for remaining pizza. Same story when we asked for the check. And -- the restaurant wasn't even busy. A few diners, like us, outside; only three or four tables inside were filled. But, the pita place next door was packed. There's a message for management in there somewhere, yes?"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, especially for the price. Very friendly staff and arguably the best happy hour in town. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Well today I find myself back at Il Capo Pizzaria for the third time this week. If u call that a relapse then i'm definitely a Capoholic. Happy hour is the best in the area and the quality of food is epically priced! And a great selection of beers and wines to intertwine the dining experience. The only thing missing from this place is a glamour shot of puppies and kittens on the wall to seal the deal. For those who don't know... Now u know! Don't miss out! A gem of Scottsdale. Shout out to the sauce boss!"}
{"text":"Best place around for a slice or pasta. Owner from Queens where they know how to make pizza. Ingredients are so fresh! You can ever get drakes devil dogs or coffee cakes!!! Yum"}
{"text":"Didn't think I would find such good pizza place here in AZ after i moved back from NY but i definitely found one. The Pies in this joint are amazing and the rest of the food is also fantastic. sometimes you have to wait for your food but its a nice sit down restaurant if you don't have time to wait the go to a fast food place but if you want good quality food this is the place to go. The owners are some of the nicest people and it shows with the rest of their staff who are equally as great. Unless you are impatient and want handouts if it doesn't come in 5 minutes I would highly recommend this place best pizza I've had since leaving the East Coast run by good people."}
{"text":"Went to try this place for the 1st time from yelp. We had a party of 7. We ordered food and only 3 people got their meals. We waited for 30-45 minutes and finally went to complain to owner He very rudely said that it is a Sunday night and we are very busy. When my husband finally received his pasta, it came out cold."}
{"text":"We came into this establishment for my wife's birthday dinner. The atmosphere was great and all of the staff was jovial. A young man named Sam served and he was a pleasure, very knowledgeable and had a great attitude. He recommended some amazing dishes and delectable pizzas, not to mention the amazing deserts! We were very happy with the experience and look forward to making it one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"Well their pizza slices looked really dry so the only option I chose was the cheese slice that was just brought out and I wasn't impressed.  Staff seemed nice though."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! 

The patio is dog friendly, which we enjoyed. You must keep your dog leashed up, no free roaming, excellent rule:) very relaxing atmosphere to enjoy the beautiful day and eat.

Inside is just as awesome. The bar is gorgeous! Not just all the drinks, but the beauty of the wood, Stools, and what the happy hour specials are displayed (very easy to read)

Excellent customer service!! Every time we have visited they make sure that you're enjoying everything from the table, food, drinks, it all. 

They have an apple arugala salad that's delicious! That is my favorite! Try it! Yum!

This place is in a great spot and are off to a great start!  Awesome local business to support!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Clean place.  We ordered the Ziti Al Forno Bolognese plus the 12 inch Fig & Prosciotto pizza.  Both dishes were great.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"So my wife and I were here about 6 months ago and I had a dish that at the time was in the top 3 meals I have ever eaten. It was a filet raviolo with a Gorgonzola cream sauce and roasted pistachios. Well, we stopped in again last night on our way to a concert and I may have to rethink my top three. I ordered the Lupara. A simple pasta dish but the simplicity simply left me dazed and my eyes almost rolled back in my head! Rigatoni with ground sausage and pepperoncini powder in a tomato cream sauce and shaved Pecorino Romano. Good golly Miss Molly! We hadn't ordered the ever popular garlic knots, but after one bite, I placed that order as I figured picking up the bowl and licking out the rest of the sauce probably wasn't appropriate. The knots were perfect for sopping up the remainder of the sauce and I managed to not chip the bowl while attempting to get every last drop. It was so good that I slowed down to enjoy all of the different flavors and didn't spill one drop on my shirt, which is very rare. Salud il Capo!!!"}
{"text":"We came in for happy hour after seeing this place in a Top Ten list. We had great service from Rachel. It was Wine Wednesday so got a bottle of falanghina for half price. I got happy hour pepperoni pizza. Ingredients were sparse but it was inexpensive happy hour pizza. My wife had a regular priced prosciutto and fig and cheese pizza which was excellent. We had gelato afterwards but were so full we probably shouldn't have. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love the happy hour menu. I got a 12 inch pizza and an appetizer for around $10.00! The bartender was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"For the past two years we always pass this place and wonder why it's not busier than it should be. The place next door is always packed and yet they continue to stay slow. My question was answered when I finally decided to visit for a pizza. They have free knots when you check in so I decided to try them. Our waiter forgot them and they never arrived! Not sure if they do that on purpose to get you in but that was a little disappointing. We ordered an 18\" pizza and added ricotta. They charge $2.00 for ricotta? It's a little pricy, wouldn't mind if they put enough on the pizza. It took too long for the pizza to come out and that's not the worst part. Both waiters had major sniffles and kept wiping their noses with their hands and fingers and never washed their hands! I was completely grossed out and never touched my water because of the lemons he handled. Not sure I will ever return. Overall the pizza tasted ok - good, not the best but that could be due to the fact that I was super grossed out by everything else."}
{"text":"We love this area, it has so many good choices and now this one is a wonderful one, also.  One evening we came after a movie, we sat at the bar and Antonia took care of us.  She was super nice and professional.  She suggested the special of the day, a fettuccini with shrimp and veggies in a light wine sauce, it was delicious.  I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture.  My husband had a Hippy Roll, which is a smaller size calzone.  Another time we went for a late lunch and we had a eggplant parmesan hero and the shrimp scampi pappardelle.  Everything has been great.  Can't wait to come back for some more.  One of this days I will be hungry enough to get a calzone, they are huge."}
{"text":"This place literally had one of the best AZ dinners I've ever had in my life. I'll give a review of everything I had.


Garlic Knots.
Where do I even begin?? These bad boys were flavorful, savory, and amazing.
Overall Review:
9.8/10

Caesar Salad.
AAHHH!!! This salad was so go"}
{"text":"Interesting place - they do woodfired and NY style pizza.

Read about this place in the magazines that come in the mail selling you home upgrades (moveable patio shade louver thingies, etc.) - sounded like it was worth checking out.

Split the lunch special Woodfired pizza and salad special with a friend.
We ordered the meatball pizza, and got a Caesar and a mixed green salad.
My friend said the Caesar was good.  The mixed green salad was attractive and a nice mix of greens, but the dressing was overly plentiful and kind of heavy (and left me with an aftertaste that, for whatever reason, reminded me of ravioli after each bite - must be something in the dressing that's commonly in ravioli?)

The pizza came out - crust was nicely charred, but kind of thick (and thus, a bit doughy).
Meatballs were decent, but the sauce was meh.

BIG space, so they must get a big dinner crowd.

Haven't tried the NY style, but I think they're facing serious competition in both categories just across the main streets - woodfired to the west, and NY to the south."}
{"text":"You will not find better pizza in Scottsdale.  I'm addicted to their food.  If you want an authentic NY style pizza place with Stromboli rolls, spinach rolls and great pizza, you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Wow! Great restaurant! Totally love the Salmon! Kids absolutely loved the pizza and the people are so nice! Glad to find this neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Il Capo Pizzeria is a fun place to grab a bite, either before or after a movie. Heck, just skip the movie and come here period. 

Il Capo is a pizza place with a small bar area. Their kitchen boasts both a Neapolitan style wood fire grill and two New York pizza ovens. Nice!  On our visit last night we tried a Margherita pizza (photo) which was very good. 

Prices were reasonable and their Happy Hour has most of their beers on tap for $1.00 off a pint. The two San Tan Hefe's were cold and hit the spot (photo). Their wine list is also very good. We enjoyed a California Pinot that tasted a lot better than the $8.00 a glass price. 

We started off with a two Meatball appetizer ($7.95) and a very flavorful Chopped Arugula Salad ($6.95). The salad was mixed with Basil (always a plus) which gave a very mild taste and had some feta cheese. We shared the aforementioned tri-color Queen Margherita and thought it was almost as good as any we have enjoyed in those certified Neapolitan places. 

The bill came to a very reasonable $42.33 including taxes, but before gratuities. We sat inside and enjoyed some hockey on two TVs while waiting for our food. The atmosphere is friendly, inviting and fun. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I regularly travel and spend my time at a variety of eateries. With the addition of il capo I regard this as one the most refreshing Italian restaurants I have ever been to. The waiters/waitresses come often to check on your needs but not to the point where you feel suffocated and unable to enjoy the food. All of the employees know the menu inside out and have great recommendation for any specific set of dietary/filling requirements needed for your entree. The food takes about 10-20 minutes to come out for each entree and 5 minutes for appetizers. The garlic knots provide are some of the freshest \"garlic bread\" types that I have ever tasted. Their texture and heat combines with the spices and marinara sauce are fascinatingly delectable. Any of the entrees that come with spaghetti/linguini/macaroni served with any of the meats is spectacular and fills you up to your needs. The plates come out hot and cooked to perfection. However, I on occasion enjoy staying to eat for 2 hours with desert. Il capo provided me with some of the best cheesecake in addition to an extravagant assortment of other desserts that I could pick from, which you could also get with tea. After leaving this restaurant I couldn't stop laughing as I had just spent one of the best nights with all of my friends in a long time."}
{"text":"Very nice place....very friendly staff, not sure why the bad reviews on services, ours was fabulous,  Marianne was our server, she was great and funny. Had appetizers that were fabulous and orders a pizza to go and Wednesdays are 1/2 off a bottle of wine. This is a definite go to place when in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Homerun again. 

The 12\" funghi and 18\" Boss were huge crowd pleaders. Meatballs as a side. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Best margarita pizza ever? Try spaghetti & meatballs as well! Yum! Never disappoints! Outdoor patio, & delivery"}
{"text":"Served us even a couple minutes after close. We weren't expecting much since it was the last slices but they were delicious! Delicious wood oven crust. Sauce and cheese is quality. We didn't have drinks but the happy hour/reverse happy hour had great prices and bogo slices. Definitely will return l."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza - texture, taste... Everything is quite fresh. Only other pizza place in the valley that rivals this pizza is Uppercrust wine bar. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place it's amazing, every time I go there I try something different and everything is just so delicious and the quality of the food it's incredible, they even get their pizza Dough from Italy  and one thing about their pizza, probably one of the best in town. Staff are super friendly and Antonia which it's the Manager there and Run the bar it's amazing, we always try to dine with her , she is so friendly, kind and warm that make you very comfortable! If you haven't been there yet your are absolutely missing out!!"}
{"text":"Very good....good pizza....order the pizza bites plus his sauce is really good......he also has an apple pie almode pizza that is over the top....good friendly people"}
{"text":"Great place! The Stromboli and pizza are excellent. Service is fantastic - they never leave you hanging and it was great to walk right into the Harkins Theatre after for a movie! I'd definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a genuinely authentic NY style pizzeria in the Scottsdale area, look no further. I am extremely impressed by the attention to detail that goes to both the quality of the food and the aesthetic of the atmosphere. Went to this establishment after a movie, and the garlic knots hit the spot."}
{"text":"*Great Happy Hour*
*Good selection of local beers*
*Perfect location for a night out*

Ingredients were fresh. Pizza dough/crust fantastic. Good service. Family friendly.

This place doesn't take the Italian theme to the strict nth degree like some places have, instead creating a comfortable familiar place that is still date worthy. 

Perfect for dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"This was a delicious find in the midst of a strip mall. Great service and even better food."}
{"text":"The best way to rate a pizzeria is to order a Margherita.. This place, in a strip mall is HANDS DOWN the best Margherita in this part of the valley.. I'd even say it feels like your in a legit NYC joint for a second.. 

I have to say i'm not a fan of the pre-cooked piza slices laying around, it just makes you guys looks cheap.. it's a pity. 

For takeaway, a little glass of vino while the suculent pie is cooking in the wood oven.. yup, this place knows REAL pizza."}
{"text":"Well, that was a let down. I guess this place is just inconsistent. We went there about a week ago and it was terrific, today just average.
Ordered bruschetta- bread was soggy and the tomatoes were ice cold. Tomatoes should never be placed in a fridge, it loses its flavor. 
Wife ordered the spaghetti & meatballs which I had last time and was delicious. Today the pasta tasted as if the it was made earlier and just reheated by dropping in hot water. Plus, not much sauce.
I decided on chicken parmigiana, this was rubbery. Again, like it was previously made.
Nice service and people but was a disappointment. I thought we had a go to Italian spot nearby, now I am second guessing. Too bad!"}
{"text":"I stopped by after seeing a movie Saturday night.  I was so happy that I stopped  by and read the menu, looked at the fabulous wood burning oven from Napoli.  The staff and the food absollutely fabuous!  I cannot wait to go back and try everything on the menu.  Mama Mia!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch special: For five bucks you get a nice salad and a slice of really good pizza. In my opinion, it's not too much and not too little. Just right. I can go back to work without food coma. If you're ravenous and have a friend with you, they have another special with a full pizza and two salads. It's more than enough for two. For a refreshing drink try their Bubblinos. It's a made with Prosecco sparkling white wine infused with fruit juice. It's light and refreshing and you won't get wasted. They make it in several flavors, I like pineapple. When the weather is nice, there's a big patio in front covered with awnings so you won't be blasted by the sun. The inside decor is \"molto bene!\" I hope that's Italian for very good? Service is always quick and the staff goes the extra mile."}
{"text":"What a great Place!!  Great food, Great wine selection and a full bar......the service was fabulous!  I would highly recommend this place :)  They are newer so we need to spread the word how great they are.....check it out you won't be disappointed!!  PS - They have great Moscow Mules :)"}
{"text":"Fitst time trying this restaurant. Very disappointed. I had eggplant parmigiana plate. The portion was so small it was not even an appetizer. My husband had fettuccine his was also a tiny portion. It was a vegetable. Eggplant and they gave one slice. Get real!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. The staff was friendly and welcoming and food was great. Perfect place for a date or a night out with the family."}
{"text":"Grabbing a belated birthday dinner for our son, and decided to give Il Capo a try. Had heard and read great things and we were not disappointed ... SO GOOD!

We had the Funghi and pepperoni pizzas, while our daughter had the spaghetti with meatballs. Everything fresh and made from scratch. 

Our server, Jon K., was fabulous!  He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, prompt, and courteous. Be sure to ask for him!

Don't go anywhere else, this place is fantastic!  We will be back!

Plus, check-in on Yelp and get a discount on the yummy garlic knots!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars but the extra star goes to the delivery man. Don't get me wrong, the food here is delicious! We ordered the Chicken Parm, Penne Alla Vodka, Beef Lasagna & the Crispy Ribs. The flavour was unbelievable, the presentation (even though they came in delivery containers) was very appealing , & the time it took to get from their location to ours. We placed our order & the gentleman on the phone was very pleasant. We paid with a credit card & waited the 45-55mins. 50mins later, I received a phone call from the restaurant stating that they do not deliver to our area as it is out of their delivery radius. I asked if the food was done & he said yes: we can either pick it up or cancel our order & they would reimburse our card. All of a sudden I could hear someone in the background saying \"they placed their order how long ago & are still waiting for it. I would be bummed.\" The man on the phone said that the delivery guy was persistent on delivering our food & that to keep in mind for next time that they will not deliver to our area. I tipped the delivery guy a very generous amount & apologized that we did not know how far out they delivered to. He smiled & said \"don't be sorry, it wasn't right that you patiently waited for your food & than told after the fact that we don't deliver as far as here.\"

Not sure if this is a Yelp feature or not & maybe I don't know how to fully embrace the Yelp world, but if a restaurant has boundaries that they don't deliver outside of, maybe they should map that for the users."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is not....  I think this would be best as to-go, enjoy at your home with better ambiance."}
{"text":"Our family of four dined in at il Capo on a Friday night. It took just a bit to get seated at a patio table because we had to wait for the hostess to seat us.  She was busy helping another customer with her check or something.  There is lots of staff so I'm not quite sure why someone else couldn't have seated us at an open table.

We all asked for water and all of us were in agreement that the water does not have a good taste.  It seems odd that a restaurant would serve water that tastes like it is unfiltered and out of the tap.  Especially in hot Arizona, please serve some water that doesn't taste awful.  Hopefully this isn't their way to force customers to order other beverages.

Our food was a mixed bag.  Garlic knots were good, but possibly a bit overcooked on the bottom.  We had to ask for napkins and ended up taking silverware off an open table by us since our table had none.

Our son ordered the pesto salmon and liked the fish, but disliked the risotto that came with it.  Two others at our table tasted his risotto and agreed it was not very good.  Our daughter had gnocchi Bolognese and thought it was okay.  She tasted my penne alla vodka and said it was better than her dish.  Personally I'd give the penne dish a 6 and would have to say I like a similar pasta dish at Oregano's much better.  My husband had the capricciosa pizza.  He liked it.  I had a taste of his pizza and would agree it was pretty good.

Our two kids ordered dessert: one raspberry gelato and the tiramisu.  Both enjoyed the desserts.

In a nutshell, we were generally disappointed that the service and the food wasn't better.  The staff just seemed to be a bit disorganized.  We all agreed that if we returned we'd stick to side salads and pizza; the fish and pasta entrees were disappointing, especially given the prices we paid."}
{"text":"Really good place, and rating strong 4. Sat outside and the neighboring restaurant has cool mist blowing to cut the heat, which can be enjoyed depending on the wind.  We ate small plates: meatballs, slowed cooked ribs, arincini and small specialty pizza. Service was excellent, food was delicious. I would definitely return to try some entrees."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great Italian food!  
This was our 4th visit to il Capo.  Their spaghetti with meatballs are just like my Italian Nana used to make.  Rich, flavor-packed sauce and the meatballs are the perfect texture. They don't skimp on the sauce or the portion.  The pasta Carbonara is very good. We had our favorite dish tonight!  It was pasta with a tomato cream sauce, bella mushrooms and ground sausage.  AMAZING flavor.  One of the best Italian meals I have had in the Valley.  il Capo staff is friendly and courteous. You're gonna love this place!"}
{"text":"Tasty Italian food - great quality, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, friendly service.  What a great find!  A few more visits like that, and I'll bump it up to 5 stars!

We stopped in with friends on a quiet Monday night.  We had attentive service and full water glasses to go with our delicious food.  

We ordered the Hippy Roll, which happened to have spinach and mozzarella that day, and came with a side of marinara for dipping.  Perfect crust, perfect melty ingredients - totally delicious.  We also got the Apple and Arugula Salad, which was light yet generous, and lovely - the slightly salty cheese was perfect with the light  sweetness of the honey shallot vinaigrette.  

Our friends had the gluten free funghi pizza, and were kind enough to give us a taste - the crust was quite nice (not weird at all) and the mushrooms were aromatic and flavorful.  Their pear salad looked so good, with its yellow grape tomatoes, that I might have to try it next time.

We didn't come all that hungry, and regrettably had to pass on dessert, but we'll bring bigger appetites next time.  I understand the tiramisu is homemade!

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Luv this place, from the time I first went (3 weeks ago) i'm there quite often.....then I went online to get phone number to order take out.....and....guess what....THEY DELIVER, what a treat.  Ordered what I usually eat there and it was amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Had their garlic Knotts along with some baked bear ice cream. Can't think of a better lunch. Staff was helpful to."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for a quick bite on our way to a late night movie. At 10pm, pretty much everything near here shuts down and stops serving food, including these guys.  It was 10:02 and I must've looked sad and hungry because the bartender was incredibly friendly and checked with the kitchen staff to see if they would make me a salad... they said yes!  So I had the delicious anti-pasta and my boyfriend had a couple slices of their leftover pies.  Leftover slices are only a couple bucks each after 10pm. Oh, and added bonus: late night happy hour gets you $3 off glasses of wine.  Short story long, the food was good and the staff was friendly.  I will definitely keep this place in mind next time I'm in the area and want good food with a smile."}
{"text":"Oops...!  OK, our first meal @ il Capo was just fine, my daughter & wife had pizza and a salad = fairly good.  I had an antipasto that I was told was made for two. Quite excellent except for sparsity of salami = 2 thin slices & 1 slice of prosciutto.  A few nice olives and fresh but, not enough lettuce & greens.

Honestly, we looked forward to going back.  And tonight, we did.  \"Oops\" is perhaps the most gentile I can be.  Tuesday night problems when not crowded?  Hmm...!

I ordered the PAPPARDALLE BISTECCA, described as:
Ribbon Pasta, Sliced Beef, Mushrooms, Onions & Red Peppers In Tomato Sauce and I ordered it with extra mushrooms + sausage.  The dish arrived piping hot with NO mushrooms {even though it's a main ingredient as described} 1 tiny-tiny slice of a corner of a mushroom... so much for extra mushrooms, huh?  There was a hind of a diced onion - actually 3 hints, each about 3mm by 2mm and maybe 1mm thick?  Oops?  The sausage was quite excellent, as was the pasta.  BUT, what happens when you order a main ingredient as extra and you need a magnifying glass and tweezers to find any traces?  Oh well.

My daughter ordered a Buffalo Chicken pizza slice and she got it - even though it must have been made a week or so ago.  She couldn't bite through or slice through it with a knife.  Kind of like old door-mat?  Heavens, the waiter was so prompt in replacing it - but, why serve it in the first place if not fresh?  OK, she then ordered a chicken parm hero which arrived after the rest of us had finished eating.  My wife had an eggplant parm hero.  She said it was OK {nothing fabulous kind of OK} 

A $50+ meal for 3 with no drinks or deserts ought to be a good bit better, or, even as described?  Heaven knows there's tons of competition in Scottsdale for really good pizza & pasta.  Tonight, I guarantee almost anywhere else would have been better with delayed, cooled, take-out.  BUT, they took my money all-righty!

So, for a place that boasts quite the NY-Style Italian Pizza & Pasta, I have to say:
\"Nah... nada, nope!\"  When the food is fresh, it is fairly nice.  When it's not, or not as ordered or not as described in the menu... then what?  You decide.  And yes, I'm a NY guy who knows where most of the great Italian joints are in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Nassau & Suffolk, Southern CT, etc.  I'll admit I've not driven to Staten Island often for dining out = just a bit too far away.


If you like small or moderate size salads...?  They're great {just by no means abundant portions}  Be sure to check your orders when they arrive - not fun to have to say or write.

It'll probably be a good while before we dare to try il Capo again - BUT, we will since we live nearby.  I'd love to give il Capo 5-stars but, I can't even get half way there. Duh!"}
{"text":"Often, I find myself at Pita Jungle, Coffee Plantation, or even at the Harkins Theaters.  Though it's right next to them, I am disappointed in myself for not knowing anything about il Capo Pizzeria until yesterday!  Last night, I went with a group of three others to grab a last minute dinner at ip Capo Pizzeria in Scottsdale.  The restaurant has a friendly atmosphere with some inside and outside seating.  

Not knowing what to expect, we decided to split two pizzas, but I learned much more about the place than just how tasty their pizzas are.  Two of us decided to order a 12\" pizza while the other two of us ordered a larger 18\" pizza.  We didn't know how filling one 12\" pizza was.  It turned out that it was a perfect size and the 18\" pizza lead to some leftovers, which I am sure will be great!  Between the pizzas and some garlic knots, we were pretty much filled up.  They apparently have some great dessert options that I wish we had room for including Smores in a Boat, Cannoli Laboratory, Apple Pizza Pie, and several gelato options.  Check out the menu at http://ilcapoaz.com.  

There are also some great deals out there!  First, if you check-in on Yelp, there is a check-in offer of a free order of delicious garlic knots.  Happy hour is daily from 2-6 PM with special prices for a variety of appetizers and even special priced 12\" pizzas.  There is also a reverse happy hour from 9 PM to close Wednesday through Saturday where you can get 2 slices for the price of 1.

Now I know to spread out the courses and be okay taking some food home.  I look forward to my next adventure to il Capo!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great. We had the Margherita pizza with garlic knots. It was warm when we picked it up and everything tasted fantastic. We both love Neapolitan pizza and this place did not disappoint. Not too much cheese and the sauce tasted awesome.

We ordered through yelp which was awesome because we got an alert stating when it would be done. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Their ready made pizza by the slice is to die for! We got the cheese, meat lovers and Stromboli. Everything is fresh! Great service and relaxing, casual atmosphere. There's a wine bar with an awesome drink selection. It's also really close to the Harkin's movie theater. Perfect place for a date night dinner and movie. Great experience, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Third time here and each time great..small plates, pizza, cannoli, service all superb"}
{"text":"Had no idea this place was tucked away near the harkins movie theater at shea! First decided to come here after finding out I could get some tasty looking garlic knots for free thanks to yelp. 
This would be a good place to take a date I think! Not too loud, nice atmosphere, and good quality food and a good portion for a reasonable price. There weren't a ton of people when we went, a good amount of people, but not crowded. No wait or anything. Service was really fast! The garlic knots were amazing. Perfect amount of garlic and the bread had a crispy outside but soft buttery inside. I had a ridiculously hard time deciding which pizza to get because there were a lot of great sounding meat-free options. The one with fried eggplant on it sounded unique and I want to try it sometime, when my appetite is larger haha. Also the pesto margherita, I wish I would've ordered that because j wasn't as into my pizza as I wanted to be. I got the Vegetariano and I think there were just too many different vegetables on there for my liking. Like it was good! Veggies were fresh! It was just too much. My friend got the regular margherita pizza and she loved it, we traded a slice and I liked hers more than mine haha. We both ate everything but didn't feel nasty because the pizza was light and not real greasy or anything. Halfway through my friend commented \"we have to come back again!\", and I have to agree!"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza by far in the whole Valley!  Just like the pizza in Italy and the atmosphere and service was great
Everything we've ordered is delicious and hand made!  We recommend this place to all our friends, it's outstanding!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pizza one night on our trip so we tried Il Capo.  What a great choice.  My husband and I ordered a salad to share and a pizza.  They brought our salads out already split up onto two plates.  The food was delicious and the staff was super friendly and helpful.   And the Hard Root Beer was amazing!"}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying I was somewhat irritated by my experience here but at the end of the day it is still a restaurant worth trying because the food is really good.  My boyfriend and I went here yesterday and we were on somewhat of a time crunch because we were going to catch a movie after.  We were seated quickly, put in our orders quickly, and our meals came out in a timely manner.  However, the problem I have is with their check in offer.  Our waitress had no idea how to help us redeem the check in offer for free garlic knots and when she went to ask someone that would know, they instructed her to tell us that we'd take care of the check in offer at the end.  As we were halfway through our meals, we reminded our waitress that we still needed the garlic knots and I was holding back on eating my pasta because I like to dip garlic bread/knots in the bolognese sauce. Our waitress had to take my phone to figure it out and was running around with my phone for a good amount of time until the manager or owner (not sure who it actually was) helped her figure it out.  Because of this, our waitress did not put the garlic knots order in for the kitchen to make until we were almost completely finished with our entrees.  I understand that the knots were free so I shouldn't be complaining but at the same time it made for an irritating experience and we barely made it to our movie in time.  Why would you offer a check in offer if you are not going to train your servers how to redeem it for the customers?  Overall, food was good and I would recommend it for someone to try because it could end up being your new favorite restaurant but I personally will not come here again."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in the state. Competition is fierce. But, the quality and flavors of il Capo are on a different level. Great service too. If you want something unique, call ahead for the grandma square pizza. It's awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pies to go - one wood fired and one build your own - the lady that took my order asked if I wanted fresh cracked pepper - my request never made it - $40 later - I will stick with my tried and always true pizza joints .....neither was a stand-out or reason to go back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine then this is the place to go!!!

When you walk in the door you can watch Master Chef Charlie behind the counter preparing pizzas to cook in his state of the art Italian oven. 

First I started with a blueberry ginger infused prosecco wine cooler. Very refreshing on a warm spring day!

I tried the Caesar Salad, the arancini (fried stuffed risotto balls), the orecchiette with fennel sausage, roasted tomatoes, broccolini in garlic broth and the tiramisu. Everything was fresh and delicious!!!!  

There are so many other dishes on the menu I can't wait to go back and try more!!!!"}
{"text":"The space is laid out a little weird,  but the Caesar salad and the square slice of pizza were delicious beyond expectation specially for $5 total. I will definitely try to come back here and recommend you try it too. And they were very friendly and fast with the check and the food."}
{"text":"Not only is the food spectacular but the service and staff was extremely friendly. Can't wait to return to this spot!"}
{"text":"Been twice, very enjoyable. Great staff. Have tried pizza and the eggplant lasagna. The pizza was good but the lasagna was amazing.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of lady friends.  Most of us had their lunch special which is for $5 you get a slice of their gourmet pizza and choice of either Caesar or mixed salad.

The salad comes on it's separate plate and the pizza is a big, generous slice. 

Both were very good. I loved the crust of the pizza. Nice and chewy. Baked in one of those big, wood pizza ovens. Excellent on the first day, fresh out of the oven. Forget your carb count & just eat it all cause it will not be hard & not tasty at all the next day. 

Why 4 stars and not 5?  Our waitress seemed a bit surly. It seemed like she was the only one serving in the whole restaurant so she was needed everywhere at once. I didn't mind it too much since I know how that can be from my college days working as a server myself. 

Check in and you get an order of garlic knots which are pipping hot and garlicky delicious! 

I would come here again, the salad and pizza are good!"}
{"text":"I am from NJ and am always looking for good authentic Italian food and NY style Pizza.  The Arancini appetizer is amazing and the salads are excellent.  I like that my kids can order a slice of pizza at any time.  I just wish the Stromboli didn't come with sesame seeds on the outside (they were premade already).  Great for date night or out with the family."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal. It only took 100x driving and walking by before we gave it a try, and I'm so happy we did. Antonia took care of us at the bar. We started with the meatballs which were totally on point! The sauce was some of the best I've ever had. Next we each had a slice of their meat lovers pizza, which had some of the best crust I've had on a pizza in AZ. This was also complimented by that amazing marinara sauce. I then ventured into a stromboli full of meat and cheese and baked with a flaky crust rolled in sesame seeds. This was my favorite item of the night!  We finished with the dark chocolate gelato. Very tasty. I highly recommend this place. Food service and ambience are best in the Scottsdale/shea restaurant area."}
{"text":"Joe and I eat here once a week! I can't get enough of their chicken Parmesan. The pizza is crisp and the cheese is gooey just the way I like it. They have a full bar and a great happy hour."}
{"text":"3.5 star food, 1 star service.

Second time here, since it's so close to Shea 14. About 2/3 full tonight for our party of four. Apps and beers were brought quickly, but still had no plates, utensils or napkins. Meatballs and caponata were solid. About 30 minutes after ordering entrees, server told us they had a problem and pizzas would be right out. Waiting.... Waiting... In the meantime, I ordered another beer. 10 minutes later, still no beer, still no pizza. I saw our server by the bar and gave him a raised eyebrow. I saw him make the \"oh, $hit, I forgot to put the order in\" face, and he quickly spoke to the bartender and sheepishly brought over my beer. Just rookie stuff.

Manager walked by and asked how things were, and apologized that it had been \"20 minutes\" since we ordered entrees. We told her it had been over 40 minutes since ordering and she said, \"Well, I'll have to check the ticket on that\". Pro tip -- do not argue with or demean your customer, especially one who hasn't been served well or raised a fuss, even though the service was awful. 

Pizzas arrived after 45 minutes and were decent -- better than chain pizzerias, but nowhere near Pomo/Federal/Bianco/Parlor quality.

Wouldn't trust them with my money and time again. Too many other options with better food and professional service with management who cares."}
{"text":"This place is to die for! Everything I ate was scrumptious! Too many things to list. The owner brought out several things to try in addition to my stromboli was exceptional!! This was orgasmic! Great happy hour! Don't be put off by it looking like some plain place. Not fancy shmancy and the prices are reasonable. Make sure you wear pants with an elastic waist when you eat here...great portions and I'm bringing a friend back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Polite but very slow service when they were not even busy. My father ordered the Caesar salad with chicken - only ate half & ended up being sick that night and next day. DO NOT eat here!  There are better places in Scottsdale. Unfortunately it is a very busy time with ASU graduation and many places were too booked."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants.
The Grandma's square is amazing as well as the Cesar salad and their meatballs are delicious. They are very nice and friendly and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Sadly, I am changing my five star review to a one star review, based on terrible customer service. I have been a loyal customer. The food is excellent. I have introduced friends to the restaurant. After tonight's horrible and disrespectful service, which could have been easily rectified but was not, I will not be back. We waited for over a half an hour for our food. That was Ok. We were sharing a bottle of wine and enjoying our conversation. When the food finally came, they had messed up my order and had to redo it. OK. By the time my food came out my friend was done with her meal. Not so OK. By the time I was done we had missed our movie. Not so OK either.  The bill came with no apology and they charged me for my very late meal. I asked to speak to the manager, explained my situation and asked to have my meal taken off the bill. She was very nice, said she understood, and said she would get it taken care of.  After another wait and having to ask for the bill yet again, I discovered that they had only taken half my meal off. When I got up from the table to asked what happened she said she had called the owner and had been told to do that. When I asked why she didn't bother to let me know that when the waiter brought back the bill she just looked at me and said \"no one told you?\" That was it. No apology. Did not seem to care a bit when I said she had just lost a customer.  Not OK at all. Customer service is as important to me as the food. If you don't take care of your customers you'll lose them. They have certainly lost me. What a shame. Looking at the other reviews here it looks like they have lost more than one customer. By the way, we walked in at 6 and left at 8. How's that for S. L. O. W."}
{"text":"The food was great, the atmosphere was okay, but that would be fixed if the restaurant were a bit bigger inside and their wait staff were more attentive and better trained. Our waitress was in a bad mood the entire time she served us and forgot to bring our drinks 3...yes I said three times! I was brought the wrong salad by a guy who almost threw the plate on our table and didn't even say anything and then basically ran away to another table. At least say something to me, don't just drop food on my table. When our waitress came over to tell me that I was brought the wrong salad, she didn't say sorry or have any apology at all, she just said \"he brought you the wrong salad.....um......\" so I asked her to bring me the salad I ordered (the roasted beet salad...very good, however I liked the first salad better...it has spiced pears, heirloom tomatoes and pecans). If I go back I'd maybe sit outside or take it to go...but not eat inside again."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly good. Make sure to get the Diavolo pizza!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect once I walked in but I was very pleasantly surprised. The garlic knots were excellent with great marinara but the homemade pasta and sausage was the best surprise!  Really great Italian food. Need to sit outside next time."}
{"text":"If I could give a 4 1/2 stars I would.

Our first experience at dinner was a 5.  We sat outside and had attentive service.  The mussels were good, the various pizzas were outstanding, but the star of the meal was the ink squid pasta.

Lunch was more average; the pasta was good but the chicken parmigiana was so-so.

Stick with the pizzas and the pasta and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"My entire family, including kids couldn't stop eating their pizza.  Mouth watering even thinking about it.  The wine and Caesar salad were good too.  Their service was really good too.  Thanks for serving us."}
{"text":"We went back to Il Capo today for lunch.  Wife had the gluten free pizza. She thought the dough (for gluten free) was very good but she thought the sauce was a bit too sweet. This is subjective as I really liked the sauce.  Daughter had the linguine with clams and wolfed it down.  On a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the best thing she has ever eaten, she gave it a 3.5.  She has eaten at some very fine places so this is actually pretty high praise.  My son had the gnocci with marinara and loved it.  He's less discerning but really loved it.

As usual, I had their pizza and thought it was great.  The non-pizza dishes were a little pricey and both of the kids wanted more but overall, a really good experience.  We'll return."}
{"text":"Very good all around. 

I had a 12\" pizza with a caesar side salad. Salad was fresh, large enough, perfect. 

I had the spicy pizza: delicious!

Service was great and the price was reasonable. 

Can't ask for much more. I will be back when I'm in this part of town again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We get takeout often for the folks.  Love chatting with Jonathon whilst sipping a glass of Goose and waiting for the food."}
{"text":"Place was great had the football game on sat at the bar. Asian women that served us was really great so nice and the food was amazing. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The best in the west! I am from NY and can tell you that this is authentic NY Italian food. You owe it to yourself to try it. The first time I went there was for their soft opening. It was day one and I can tell you that it has ambiance and a very friendly staff. The owner Mario personally greeted me and brought me a sample of his orincetti which otherwise are known as rice balls. I felt like I was back home it was out of this world! The pizza is so delicious.  He told me his stove was imported from Italy. This is a treat for AZ. Go for it. And don't forgetaboutit!; Manga and enjoy. I've been back twice since..u will too!"}
{"text":"1st time here and will be back many times. Food and service were off the charts. This is a must eat place."}
{"text":"Ordered food. Was told it would be delivered in 30-45 minutes.  3 couple together had 6 kids under the age of 6 and they were all starving for dinner.  After an hour and 20 minutes we called and they said they sent 5 deliveries in one car and that we (the customer) are the problem. 

The food never ended up getting delivered because the owner felt that we wouldn't want it after all that time.  I went to the restaurant to speak with the owner to find out what actually happened.  Who ever took the order wasn't paying attention, didn't know how to spell, didn't know to ask for a customer to clarify an address or ask for a phone number that the customer could be reached at.  

I have no idea how the food actually is, but was given the 12\" pizza on my way out with parting word to \"not order the 12\" thin crust to go because they just don't hold up well for travel\".  Makes me wonder why they gave it to me it they really aren't proud of it.

Had the restaurant been up front and honest with timing (and actually told us if a pizza wouldn't be good delivered) maybe we would have had a chance to try it."}
{"text":"Another great evening at Il Capo.  We took out of town guests for Happy Hour and ordered the Arrancini....fabulous as always!  We also ordered a variety of other HH items then had the Lupara.  Our guests had never had Lupara before and they loved this creamy pasta dish.  Lisa, our waitress, was very attentive.  I'm always pleased taking guests to Il Capo and never tire of the best Arrancini in town!

7-29-16. Took friends to Il Capo before going to The Don Bluth Theater.  They loved the happy hour pizza and arrancini.  I couldn't order anything else but the Lupara!  Again, a great meal and great service from Jon!  I only wish they would deliver further north so I could get meals delivered!"}
{"text":"I love this place... Food is awesome... Been eating here on average about 3 or 4 days or nights a week since they opened.  What can I say, I'm from NYC and I found a great NY Pizza Restarunt in Scottsdale. I'm not even going to say NY Pizza Style Restarunt ... It straight up tastes like your eating Italian food in NY except without having to defrost your car for 15 minutes to get there. 

The staff is great, friendly and fun. Antonia at the bar is a friend of mine, She gets me my drinks... Well not for free, but she gets my drinks and is professionally fun. 

I'm not a wine drinker but \"Wine Wednesday\"  1/2 price bottles of wine draws a fun vibrant crowd and I always have a blast meeting the guests. 

My name is Rob ... You should come on out and maybe you will get to meet me. I will be the guy wearing a \"Be Blessed\" shirt ... but if I'm not here the fun staff will be ready to make your experience great.

{"text":"We just ate here and had wonderful service and a wonderful waitress. Now off to the movies. I really would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.

They may have counter service for slices but I was seated and handed a menu instead the few times I've been here. Just trying to get a quick slice for lunch. The owner has reached out and assured me there is an express counter to order from and I'll give it a go again soon. 

When I want a pizza slice for lunch there's usually 2 main reasons driving that decision. (other than my love for pizza)

1. I want a fast meal, order at the counter and leave the moment I am done. Lunch break time is precious and every minute counts. I had to chase down my server each time...

2. I want an inexpensive meal with no need to pay extra tipping a full service waiter or waitress. This is a slice of pizza we're talking about!  20% tip is less than a dollar. Does the waitstaff really benefit from 60 cents or do they expect us to tip 30% or more? Seriously? That's why such a hub bub about the whole express counter service option.

As far as the food goes, it's actually pretty good. I tried the ribs appetizer my first visit. Nice and tender but left little room for pizza for me that time. Been back only a few times since and got a slice for lunch each time.  Slices are very filling and I like the whole happy hour all day (practically) and they offer free garlic knots with yelp checkins. A little greas & undercooked this time but the last time they were much better.  See others' pictures, the dark golden brown knots you see from other Yelpers are what I had the 1st time.  To be honest the slices are kind of expensive but you get a decent value with Yelp check in (if you like garlic knots that is) 

Perhaps create some slices specials that appeal to those of us on a budget (or aren't in the mood for knots) then I feel it may get even more traffic then it does now.  I'd certainly go back! Many business offer 2 deal choices on a single yelp checkin screen."}
{"text":"Good Food!
Sometimes it's even Really Good Food.
The service is a different story.  They haven't found a welcoming bartender yet...
Maybe with time the experience will show it's face in thus chill eatery..?!"}
{"text":"I only write reviews when I really think they deserve a great on or a really bad one. 
This is a great one. The pizza is the best in Scottsdale for sure maybe in Phoenix (but I haven't eaten in all of them) but il Capo is so good. The margarita I got didn't have enough mozzarella on in but the crust was so good I went back and it was amazing. I think it was late and they had run out. Service was good and the prices are very reasonable. I would put it up to any pizza place and it would come out on top. Keep up the standards and you will really shine. One of the best pizza joints I have ever eaten at and I have eaten them in NY and all over LA one of the best I ever had. 5 star Pizza. !!!!!!!
A must go to for some quality wood burned pizza."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. I highly recommend the fried risotto balls appetizer. The marinara and bolognese sauce is extremely flavorful. The ambiance is laid back and casual and the staff are very friendly and attentive. The food came out very fast. They sell pizza by the slice which is nice for the kids. Really great cannolis for dessert."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant in the valley! The Pizza and Pasta were awesome, service was outstanding and the prices reasonable.. Their by the slice options are tasty demonstrations of the pizza art and the apple pizza was a great take on an old classic.. A full service bar and good wine selection top off a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and they were a bit slow considering the rest of the plaza was packed. Service was off, but the food was on point. Everyone was pleasant, just could have been more attentive. I will still come here and I do recommend the food. The misfire in service keeps me from giving them 5 stars, which I would really like to do."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day, prior to catching a movie over at Harkins. It was my first time at il Capo, and every time I go to Pita Jungle I think..\"I need to try that place\"

I thought it was good, I got a calzone with meatballs, wife got a slice of the white pizza and pear/argula salad.  The calzone was HUGE, I took half home for a snack. It was loaded with cheese, melty and delicious, though there wasn't any marinara in it so I asked for a side of it, and it became perfect. I liked the sauce a lot. 

Service was great, attentive, and my drink was always filled, bathroom was clean..  I will def be back to try a pie. If you want pizza in this shopping area, do not even CONSIDER going to kitchen nightmare ABC - come to il Capo, much better"}
{"text":"Our 1st time here ! And we will be back 
Good food at  reasonable price for scottsdale! Michael had the gnocchi I 
Had the pesto salmon . And finally a place who makes a traditional cannoli without chocolate chips!  Kudos we had a nice barbera. And our bartender Amtonia was 
Amazing witty  and quick on her feet"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I have been here 3 times this week for lunch. They have a great special- a slice of pizza and a side salad for $5. Awesome! The pizza is really good and the place itself is beautiful- love the turquoise wood fired oven. I always sit at the bar and everyone is so friendly. They haven't been here very long so the business is still growing, but I choose this place over pita jungle every time. Definitely give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop before a movie. Staff is very friendly. We especially like the gelato list. There is enough on the menu to keep us interested."}
{"text":"We returned because last week they were packed so we figured the food was good. We only had to wait for 20 minutes for inside seating and the wait was definitely worth it! 

I had the Buffalo slice pizza and it had a very authentic taste and the crust was just the perfect thickness. The slices are reheated but the oven made it taste like it was fresh and hot right out of the oven for the first time. 

My guest had the clam fettuccine she ate the entire dish it was so yummy!

Our waiter Michael was very attentive test and make sure our glasses were continually full . He did a great job checking in with us to make sure the food was good but yet stayed out of our way so we could enjoy each others company."}
{"text":"OK. So I am a New Yorker. I have had some of the best Italian you can find anywhere outside of Italy. I just moved to Phoenix and one of my first orders of business was to search for an Italian restaurant. It just so happens that my parents, who still live in NY, were out to visit for Christmas and we decided to give Il Capo a try. 

Going out to eat isn't an easy task, especially when you have 4 kids, ages 6, 4, 2 and 1, in tow. We were warmly greeted as we walked in and our server, Tim, set up the tables to accommodate our party of 8.  Since we had such a large party, we wanted to try a good sampling of various items on the menu.

We started with garlic knots, breaded clams and rice ball. The garlic knots were nice and big, perfectly cooked and seasoned wonderfully. The sauce it was served with was so good, I finished eating the rest of it with my fork. The rice ball was served on a bed of the sauce and sprinkled with cheese. The breading was crispy and the rice inside was moist and well flavored.  The breaded clams were a nice appetizer. There were 12 small clams with a well seasoned breading on the top of a bed of fresh arugula. Using the lemon juice over the arugula, it made a nice bonus salad.

The kids had a half cheese, half pepperoni pizza which had the perfect balance of toppings. The crust had a nice crunch and paired nicely with the sauce and mozzarella cheese.  My wife had the Chicago Beef Dip with sweet peppers and a pasta salad with a giardiniera type dressing. The beef and peppers were a perfect combination of flavors on the crunchy bread. The dip enhanced the flavor of the meat and peppers, which I didn't even think was possible. My parents split a Margherita pizza, which I have been craving for a while. The wood fire flavored crust matched with the olive oil, mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil all married together to form the perfect slice of pizza I was missing. I decided on the Chicken Parmesan, a staple at any Italian food joint. The chicken was nice and thin and covered with sauce and cheese, melted to form a slight crunch to the cheese. I was very impressed that the side of pasta wasn't just noodles with sauce tossed on top, but the noodles themselves were tossed with sauce before being placed on the plate which led to an even distribution of sauce all over the noodles. Some shaved cheese and parsley sprinkled on top were the perfect finishing touches to this dish. 

After all of this, there was no way we were going to leave without desert. We got a plate of cannoli, a tiramisu, and a slice of NY Cheesecake.  The cannolis were excellent with a dusting of pistachio on one side and chocolate sprinkles on the other.  There were four of them on the plate and the shells were dusted with powdered sugar. The filling was the perfect cannoli consistency - thick and sweet. The cheesecake had cherries and a syrup on the top. I am not a cheesecake fan, but this was delicious. The sauce was not overbearing and the cheesecake itself was amazing. I primarily had the tiramisu, which is a tricky dish to master. Il Capo did just that. The lady fingers were soaked perfectly and the marscapone filling was done wonderfully. Too many times, the filling is too sweet in an effort compensate for the bitter goodness of the espresso soaked lady fingers, but not here. The desert portions were generous as well. The cheesecake and the tiramisu were nice sized and were were all able to sample a little of each.

A final note about our server, Tim. Excellent waiter! Most times a family with little kids strikes fear into the hearts of servers, but not Tim. He was very patient and kind with the kids and was always there with a refill on drinks and to make sure the food was up to our standards.

Excellent place, I will definitely be back to try some more of the menu. Unless they want to move their kitchen into mine. I'd be okay with that, too."}
{"text":"Love this place. My boyfriend and I frequent here about once every two months for a date night. My favorites are the pasta diavolo and the arrenchette the best salad and white pizza is good as well. Drinks are a bit pricy but half off bottles of wine on Wednesday's is nice. The wine list could be better, and the service is often slow so unless you're in a rush you should have a good experience."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour here and it was great . Had pizza , garlic knots , beer and Moscow mule which was a killer !
Pizza was AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is the best over there. The old Italian geezer is the best ever at flipping that dough."}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars, if I could.  It is literally the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. We sat for 45 minutes with no food. The owner came out and berated us and never apologized.  The owner was extremely rude! The only positive note was the server, Candace, was wonderful!  Do not eat here unless you enjoy being yelled at and insulted by the owner.  The old Amy's baking Company just closed because of horrible owners. I guess Il Capo took its place!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Il capo recently, you need to give them a try! When they first opened the food was delicious, but the service was slow and just \"okay\". Now, the food is delicious and the service is excellent. The kitchen gets the food out fast and cooked perfectly too! The garlic knots never disappoint... They are loaded with garlic!! I've tried many of the pizzas and pastas and have never been disappointed. The pizza is always cooked to perfection and the handmade pastas are just incredible. Handmade pastas are so much better than any pasta you will get at another Italian place!
I've had the gelato a few times as well.. Also incredible! Never had something here that I didn't enjoy. Definitely give Il Capo a try. They run a great business and really know how to cook and serve good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place and had fantastic food and great service. Meatball was perfect and pizza was great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while my kid is at a nearby soccer practice and was greeted immediately by Maryanne.   We had drinks quickly and she guided us toward the salad with pears .....fabulous and the Diablo pizza which was fabulous as well .  Maryanne was back several times to check on us and our drinks were filled quickly .  We practice soccer nearby 3 x a week  and we will back!!!!   See you then!"}
{"text":"Service is always great! The meatballs are incredible, but the happy hour is what is really the best thing about Il Capo's. Great portions, tasty options and so close to the movie theatre you have another option once you finish your great meal!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I came here before a movie. We unlocked a free garlic knots by checking in - score! They were soft and covered with garlic butter. Like, really garlicky which is perfect for me. We split the Italian sausage pizza and a salad - can't remember which- but it was very good. The oven is one of those big 900 degree heat ovens with the tiny tiles all around it. I have seen one just like it at another pizza parlor and they had flown it in from Italy, and wonder if they did the same here; shoulda asked. That being said, every pizza gets a different \"doneness\", with some more crispy and brown than others. Ours turned out good. The server was wonderful and attentive and very friendly."}
{"text":"Plus-a-star-to-five-stars update!

Il Capo is just seriously dreamy. The service is great. The food is phenomenal. I'm officially a fangirl for life.

We visited this past Saturday for an early (5:00 I think?) dinner. I had passed out for 2 hours after a HOT and HILLY half marathon (never again) and woke up ravenous. I wanted something to re-fill that calorie deficit. I wanted IL CAPO!

It was hard to decide on something other than pizza, since our first visit's pizza choices were so outstanding. But we explored the rest of the menu (we are so brave) and landed on: happy hour bruschetta (3 pieces for $2.95...delish!), eggplant parm for me, chicken parm for boyfriend. There was not even a crumb or swipe of sauce left on any plates. WIN.

Both our mains were outstanding but we both RAVED and fell in deep, real love with the side of pasta and marinara our dinners came with. Perfectly al dente pasta with homemade sauce topped with parsley and Parmesan...I know it sounds so simple but when it's done so perfectly words escape you, you know? Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. My wine was great. I slept like a bambino that night.

Il Capo, I've said it before, but thanks for being alive!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal here today... Best meatballs ever... Their mini plates are perfect for me because I'm not a big eater;). Great service and atmosphere... The patio is awesome it was just to hot to sit there today... A must visit"}
{"text":"New York, New York
The best Pizza & Italian Food since leaving The Big Apple in 1996.  It is about time someone GETS IT!
Great Owner & Staff.  Quick, efficient and courteous.  Can't say enough great things about this place.

Great recommendation from our friends
This will definitely  be our new favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to eat at il Capo Pizzeria and will say that I will be back.

It was Sat evening and they were fairly quiet...they are newer yet so hopefully as word spreads business will pickup. As I browsed the menu posted outside a few of the staff would stop and ask if I had any questions or needed any help, but not in that annoying obnoxious way some staff can be. They were very friendly. 

I decided to eat on the patio which is dog friendly. This doesn't bother me but an FYI if that is something that bothers you before you decide to choose to sit outside. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful. When we asked about the salads he suggested that we could probably split (between 2 of us) one rather than each of us getting our own. We got the Caesar with chicken add-on. The chicken was plentiful and the quantity of dressing was just right...the romaine was not drowning in it. We then split the Cacciare wood fired pizza. Our server explained how to oven was imported from Naples. Let me say, it was absolutely worth it. The pizza crust was exquisite and cooked perfectly with very flavorful toppings.

On the downside they were out of some of the SanTan brews...good to see people drinking local but disappointed none available during our visit."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  David is excellent. Outside patio is relaxing.  Calamari and apple and arugula salad for appetizers are our staples here.  If you like mussels these are the bomb. The sauce is great."}
{"text":"This review was removed by Yelp who stated that they think it was meant for a different restaurant. Let it be perfectly clear, it was meant for il Capo and it is correctly posted and the lousy dining experience is accurately stated!!! The original post was done about a month ago. 
Zero stars would be more accurate but not a choice. We were 2 couples. Took 45 for the pizza to come out. 10 minutes later the salad came out and had to be sent back as it was just lettuce on the Cobb salad. They forgot all the ingredients that make it a Cobb. The replacement came with an apologetic waitress. Our friends finished their pizza and replacement Cobb. We enjoyed watching them eat but still didn't receive our dinners. We sat another 30 minutes after they finished eating before they brought my wife and my dinners. Mario, the manager/owner?? came out and was very rude to us and the folks at the next table. Never apologized but just made excuses. He blamed the waitress for putting in too many orders! That's what waitresses do, they take an order and put it in. The people at the next table never even got their food and neither did another table. They complained and just left after this Mario rudely told them to get out and never come back! See the review by Angie B. below. They were the group that walked out!
With all the great Italian restaurants in Scottsdale, I will be sure to avoid this one in the future. Suggest you do the same. 
On a positive note, our waitress was great as she kept my water glass full."}
{"text":"First time for me at Il Capo. I got here earlier than my friends but they sat me down anyway. I had coffee while waiting. We took a while to place our order but the waitress didn't seem to mind. I had the Caesar Salad & Arancini for my dinner. I didn't realize I would get 2 rice balls so I took one home. Food was delicious and server was patient & accommodating. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was one of the most unique and exceptional meals I have had in some time. 
Great service on a busy Saturday night during the phx open. 
My wife said to me and I quote \" I think we just found our new favorite Italian restaurant \"

I asked for some extra bread as I didn't want a drop of the sauce in my pasta dish to escape it's destiny. 

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Okay so I see photo evidence the beets are roasted there. Maybe I just don't like beets? Upgrading to 4 stars and disregarding the roasted beets."}
{"text":"VERY HIGH quality ingredients that evoke true Italian home cooking your family would make.
The gentleman that greats you makes you feel at home, that you have his undivided attention when speaking to him and that he has a genuine satisfaction in service to his patrons. 
Overall I am very pleased with the standards they uphold and have visited this location frequently.
I would recommend them to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"I originally visited to kill time before a movie. I was by myself, so sat at the bar. And I kept it small, so I could run back to the theater after killing some time with a lil wine. I had a glass of wine & the bruschetta. The bruschetta was great - very fresh ingredients and the balsamic was just the right sweetness. And even though the food was great, I really noticed how personal the service felt. I truly felt like I was waiting for my movie with a new friend, thanks to the bartender who looked after me, Antonia. So, I visited again in the following weekends, pre- or post-movie and ordered pasta meals rather than just appies. Gnocchi was the first I had, as that's my fav pasta - theirs didn't disappoint me. The texture was perfect - not gloppy and the sauce was nice and rich. Next I tried the spaghetti and meatballs - loved it. I actually ate the entire plateful, which is a rarity because I never finish my entire meal. So, the food is really good, and as I said, I really appreciated never really feeling like I was dining alone, thanks to the personal attention of the staff. And, I finally tried their pizza, which they're known for, but oddly, I'd not tried despite becoming a regular. They serve NY style slices, and although I'm not from NY to know the authenticity, I love their pizza. But, truth be told, their Stromboli is my all-time favorite there. It's ridiculously good - I highly recommend it. I also have sat on their patio with my dog (I've a 9 lb dog), which they happily accommodated, however I'm not sure what the policy would be for larger dogs, as mine remained on my lap the entire time I ate. But it was really nice to be able to bring my little one and enjoy a glass of wine at the same time. I really feel at home at Il Capo, as it's become my neighborhood eatery. Anyway, with regards to the pizza slices, after a certain time later in the evening they sometimes offer a buy one get one, so call and ask for details on that. Also, they have great specials. I highly recommend Il Capo!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet some friends for lunch during the week.  I think we were the only people there throughout our hour lunch although Pita Jungle next door was packed.

We each had the salad/one slice pizza lunch special. 

Pizza wasn't that memorable although the slice was generous. The garden salad was ok yet I think it was not that fresh. 

Not sure if I'd come back yet if Pita Jungle is too busy, this place might be an ok alternative."}
{"text":"Great food awesome service.  Will be back to get pizza by the slice and the drinks were amazing


I can't wait for our next date night it will be here. Super casual and cozy"}
{"text":"Worst tomato sauce ever.  Their fettuccine alfredo (minus the bacon bits) was pretty good, though I've had better and wouldn't go just for that."}
{"text":"Always a great spot before movie. Good local beer from STATE 48.  Pizza cooked perfectly in my opinion.  1st option in this with out a doubt in this Shea and Scottsdale road area."}
{"text":"I've been there twice for a late lunch and had the Linguini & Clams both times. Really tasty! Everyone is friendly and I look forward to branching out and trying other items on the menu...maybe lasagna next time!"}
{"text":"They have great pizza! The \"Grandma\" is my favorite and tastes like a recipe handed down from their Italian grandma. It has a vivid blend of oregano, basil and other wonderful Italian flavors on a thick, yet crispy-bottom crust. It's the slice, pictured below, with the rectangular cut. I also tried the traditional (regular crust) pepperoni pizza which was baked perfectly in their wood fired pizza oven.

The atmosphere is casual, with a hip feel to the bar. See the photo of the curved metal ceiling. 

The staff was warm and wonderful. We had stopped in after a late movie. (il Capo is located right across the parking lot from the Harkins Shea 14 movie theatre.) We didn't know that il Capo was closing, and yet the charming Italian waiter welcomed us with no hesitation, convincing us to stay for as long we wanted. My mother and I chatted for quite a while as we had Peroni and pizza, and the waiter insisted that we \"take our time and enjoy: they were just cleaning anyway.\" When we left, feeling guilty that we had stayed so long, we saw a couple go in, and they were welcomed just as warmly!

'Love il Capo. I'm returning this week for lunch, before a movie, with a friend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for date night.  It's a bit smaller than it appears from the outside, but is a nice place.  Their wine list was rather extensive & the chianti I had was above average (my wife had captain & coke, so...).

The bruschetta was good with the bread being soft to chew but firm enough to hold the ingredients.  

The ribs were delicious!  The sauce was sweet but not sugary, with hint of dark chocolate (perhaps?) with the meat falling off the bone.  I'll go back just for those ribs.

The pizza was thin crust but not crispy and the toppings (mushrooms & sausage) were fresh.  But the key to any good pie is the cheese & sauce.  The sauce was excellent with the real star being the cheese.  This is very good pizza.

We will return.

Go.
Eat.
Drink.
Enjoy."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza to go, at the bar, and dining in (seated next to the windows).  In all cases - GREAT PIZZA and excellent service.  I have to give an extra thumbs up to Tim who's service was warm and very attentive - it made the dining experience even better (love when that happens).  I'll be back - it's in a great location to stroll afterwards as well - or go to the movie."}
{"text":"Penne alla Vodka was very filling and delicious! The sauce was excellently prepared, and the noodles were just the right texture. The bruschetta was made with some fairly fresh tomatoes, but the bread tasted smokey, possibly slightly burnt. Just okay. Garlic knots were great flavor for a good price. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The owner Mario was exceptionally generous and treated our family like a close friend. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time getting pizza from here. Excellent pie (18\" with eggplant). Was a pickup. They were real busy and noisy and yet great service at the bar for the pickup, which is impressive. Downside - if you live here, you know it's a busy, crowded center and it's hard to find parking. Luckily there's a few spaces around back for pickup, and hopefully that's respected. Will come back for an eat in. Hope we find a parking space.

Came in twice in two weeks between films at the Jewish Film Festival. Interesting $5 Happy Hour beers and small.pizzas. This time it was eggplant and red peppers. Just perfect and thanks for getting us out in time."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The kids eat free special on Sunday was great. Will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"Born and raised on the east coast this is by far the most authentic New York pizza I have found in Arizona. Love their baked ziti and chicken parm sandwich too!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time New Year's Day.... Server was super friendly and food was definitely a 10. So many places my husband and I eat the waitresses mess up our orders and it just ruins the evening but we've been here three times and our orders have been perfectly delicious every time! Also love that they deliver to our home! You will not be disappointed in this place!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend for lunch and had the Fettuccini Carbonara. It was delicious as there was a good amount of sauce to pasta. The atmosphere was nice and the service was good."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Thursday night. Not too crowded and we were seated right away. Yelp check-in scored us free garlic knots. Off to a great start. Definitely get the garlic knots. They were so delicious, I would've made a meal out of them. 
We ordered apple/arugula salad to share. Came out already split into two plates; very nice service. However, the arugula already was turning yellow. But, I was happy they had organic and the salad dressing was amazing; slightly sweet tasting. 
For main entree, we had Orecchiette (elbow pasta) and Pasta Diavola (angel hair). Both were delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly 'al dente'. Both dishes were slightly on the salty side; but otherwise, very good. 
The waitress recommended State 48 Blood Orange beer and it was really good as well. 
We were too full to try any desserts, but overall highly recommend this restaurant. The staff was very attentive and made us feel welcomed. We will be returning to try their other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Found a new great place to eat! It right by the Harkins 14 off Shea and Scottsdale. Great for a date! My husband and I decided to try this close by Italian restaurant. They make their own pastas in house. I was very happy to find that they have a tasty Tiramisu! Tons of gelato options as well. Full bar, great cocktails! Jon was wonderful! Chef Jarrett was amazing! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of nights ago for the second time, and I have to say the quality of the pizza is still amazing! There's something about the crust, so crispy and flavorful that makes me want to drive just to have a bite of it!! I love the Grandma and the Caprese!!! Staff is always cordial and attentive! 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"We visited Il Capo after finding it online while searching for something new in Scottsdale, where our vegetarian friends could find a broad selection of food.
We arrived around 7pm, before our friends, admittedly on a weekday night and the place had three tables seated.
The atmosphere was ok but no real ambience, and certainly no buzz from being busy.

After our friends arrived we ordered a chopped salad for the table and ordered three pizzas and a spaghetti and meatballs. The salad was excellent.

The pizzas, all vegetarian varieties, were lacking flavor. Possibly there was no seasoning so they were simply adequate. The crust was quite good, but the overall pizza just lacked something.
The spaghetti and meatballs were good. The sauce was a little thick, but was good. It needed a lot of pepper to give it some flavor kick though.

Halfway through our meal, by around 8pm the restaurant was empty, with just our table working.

The service was very attentive and our waiter, Tim was really good. He knew the menu and was very accommodating with special requests for capers and olives on one of the pizzas.

If they take care with the seasoning on their pizzas they will do better.
Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! Everything is very fresh and authentic there's nothing about this place I would change we are from chicago and pizza is everything !!!! We won't be missing out home town so happy to have found this gem !!"}
{"text":"This place is truly awesome!!! The food and service is on point. I would list all the good stuff but all of it is great. Love the vibe of this joint so much."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker visiting AZ, wasn't expecting much from a pizza place.  And then I went to Il Capo.. UNBELIEVABLE. 
The meats and cheeses were fresh and apparently homemade.  Do I order sauce that's not my moms? Went ahead and ordered the gnocci. Was so full but could not stop eating, until my plate was clean. Sampled my friend's ravioli, and debated who made the better choice.  Light, fluffy, and cooked to perfection. 
The pizza could have been straight out of New York City. Or Italy. 
After 18 hours of driving, left Il Capo with a full stomach and a smile on my face. Would recommend to anyone passing through looking for a delicious meal!"}
