{"text":"Co-worker and I were looking to stop at a local pub after work and ended up and Crown and Lion.  Atmosphere is typical British pub complete with dart boards on one side.  80's music was somewhat of a surprise but quickly a hockey game replaced the music.  I had fish and chips with one fillet which was plenty.  The batter on the fish was light, but the accompanying fries were just okay.  They have a real nice hard cider on tap."}
{"text":"Sheppard's Pie. Bangers and Mash. and did I mention Sheppard's Pie?  I've been here many times...and it is always consistent.  Staff are friendly, and there are nice booths in the back."}
{"text":"Starting to come here a lot more since my local pub (Mad Hatter) closed down. Great place to come to catch a game of footie, have a pint and some good food.  Was in here yesterday and their shepherd's pie was not as good as it usually is and I did not eat most of it. I did not want to create a fuss so I was just going to pay for it, but when I got the bill they had taken it off. Very friendly staff and very accommodating.  Will write more once I have tried more of the food. I can tell you that the wings are excellent, great onion rings as well. Good specials on Mondays ($7 per lb wings) and Tuesdays is hall price burger night. They also have a different soup which I believe are made fresh each day and have home made desserts.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to the Crown and Lion with my girlfriend for dinner one day after passing by earlier in the week. We ordered the Onion Rings as a starter and they were crispy and delicious, with the dipping sauce also being very tasty. My girlfriend doesn't normally go for onion rings, but she said they were the best she ever had. The Fish and Chips were delicious, crispy and flaky. The Steak and Guinness pie was hot, hardy and filling. The servers were super friendly, and made sure everything was going great with our meal without being intrusive. We will be going back to try more of the menu. Will be recommending to all our friends and family."}
{"text":"Great customer service, food is average and a good atmosphere. They have alot of activities on the weekend. Some of the activities include dart night, trivia and painting."}
{"text":"Really nice pub feel. Been here a few times and food has been great. The service is the best part, you feel very welcomed and they treat you well."}
{"text":"Great ambience , good food and  friendly service. Tried beer battered fish n pitcher of bud."}
{"text":"Pretty good little neighbourhood place, but the food is really hurting.  Atmosphere is nice and traditional.  English pub style: dim inside with some HDTV's on the wall, and the selection of beer is always fresh and good (and they were the first adopters of Rolling Rock I've found in Brampton..  Not a great beer, but nice glassware and acceptable on draft I guess)  The problem is that I find their food to generally be below your average pub fare, and very expensive.  Salad's come with terrible gloopy bottled dressing that is never mixed properly.  Wings are soggy and bland..  Burger was most certainly a generic frozen brand as well..  Nothing unusual for a pub but it's too bad they're not doing more, considering the inside of the bar is well above average for Brampton standards..  Maybe things will change.  Stick to the beer and avoid the food and you'll be happy"}
{"text":"My son And I come here a couple of times a month and we really enjoy it. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and good food, although a bit pricey for a pub."}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect, nothing special. Came here with my girlfriend late afternoon but the service was still a bit slow even though the place wasn't packed. Waitress was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Look it's a pub and Canadian pubs are not known for caring much for quality but food-wise the rye steak sandwich was actually delicious and well done. It was a pleasant surprise. The fries were useless of course though. I liked the layout of this pub. You can sit in the front, to the side, at the bar or be hidden in the back. They also have a patio, although nothing separates it from the six lanes of asphalt. We really liked being in the back in the half empty pub. I am sure the owner wants more customer, but we enjoyed having it to ourselves. I admired the kind service from the waitresses. They were polite, caring and paused to listen and check in.  There are TVs everywhere and the washroom was clean."}
{"text":"The three of us went a few weeks ago as we were craving burgers (what else is new right?) and my brother loves the burgers here so suggested we also try it out. My brother especially loves it on Tuesdays where the burgers are half price!   This neighbourhood pub is only about 2 blocks from where I live so I am a bit biased. The service is very friendly and the menu is your standard pub fare. We all got burgers (of course) but also started off with a big plate of nachos with all the fixins (chicken, steak and chili plus all the usual cheese, jalape√±os, sour cream, salsa, etc).   With the burgers, we all decided to try different sides (fries, sweet potato fries and a Greek salad).   Everything was delicious but I'd give the burgers only about a 3 out of 5. Try them out on a Tuesday where you only pay half the price and see what you think. My brother loves them so maybe I am just picky but as I have stated in previous burger reviews, I prefer a burger made with ground chuck and this seemed more like a good quality grocery store frozen variety. I think the best comparison of this burger would be a Harvey's burger (which a lot of people enjoy, so I don't want to knock Harvey's). Just stating my personal preference and the best comparison I can think of.  The desserts look pretty awesome so will have to come back just for that! I was way too full to try anything out :)   All in all, definitely worth checking out. The menu and people there are great!"}
{"text":"came here for the first time tonight for a christmas outing with my work team. pub had live music after the leafs game. not sure if it's just a thing on saturday or if its daily, but that was kinda cool. lots of options on the menu, i went with shepherd's pie and sweet potato fries as the side. food was great and my water was always full without me even noticing so that means the servers were doing their jobs and coming by frequently. i'd definitely come back. lots more on the menu i'd like to try."}
