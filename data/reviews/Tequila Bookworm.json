{"text":"Solid place to go on crazy Queen W. for a quick or slow drink.  I think this is one of those places that won't give you the bill as a thinly veiled threat to hurry up and leave.

The brussels sprouts were burnt.  But I still ate 'em.  They were quite yummy.  What's a little carcinogen on the side with your bar snack?

As mentioned in other reviews:  The staff here are some very nice eye candy.  And I mean that not in a creepy way.    It adds a certain je ne sais quoi to the drinking experience.

They seem to have a patio upstairs, which should be nice in the summer.  Will return to confirm."}
{"text":"Cool place to grab a beer and some grub!

Highly recommended the brussels sprouts and the Chicken bites."}
{"text":"A nice and cozy place. Brunch was good. But music was too loud for my taste. I wouldn't call this place a cafe. It had more of a pub atmosphere with the focus being on drinks, especially beer."}
{"text":"I used to run a writers group and we met at The Tequila Bookworm a few times before we got tired of the attitude we got from the staff members.

Questions about the menu were answered with sighs and eyerolls. When we asked if it was possible to get the music turned down a bit - not off, just down - the guy behind the counter said, in a very snotty tone, \"Just so you know, we don't usually take requests from customers.\" Right, cause those customers are only keeping you in business. 

There are many other funky little coffeehouses and cafes that I'd rather spend my money in."}
{"text":"I'm still on the fence about Tequila Bookworm since it moved from its last location just down the street.

The service is slower than you can even imagine. But the coffee is great and they make this weird potato pancake thing that tastes like total bland, but sometimes that's all you can handle.

This is the perfect place for you to go if you're a student and you just want to drink cheap coffee and click away on your computer all day long."}
{"text":"Ate brunch here for the first time today.  The waitress was so pleasant and she made a perfect latte.  We had the french toast and the scrambled egg panino.  Both were delicious.  The place really filled up, but as a lone waitress she kept her cool and everyone was enjoying themselves. 

This is  my new Sunday favourite!"}
{"text":"Great place. I went for a date, good selection of drinks, nice atmosphere, good service. Nothing particularly impressive either."}
{"text":"Totally random drink stop turned into dinner - a great experience!  Earnest and friendly servers,  fast food service. All of our food was fresh and high quality: hand made corn tortilla chips with two salsas and great guac, and a Portobella mushroom Burger with chevre that was not huge but flavourful and filling.  As cider fans, the selection was interesting and varied. Oh, and nice decor and chill R&B. Definitely a new queen west favourite."}
{"text":"I hadn't been there in years but ended up there for coffee today.  Nice, relaxed vibe, funky mix of people but man alive the service was horrendous.  It took over 30 minutes for the server to bring our coffee.  And the coffee was lousy to boot.  Not sure how this place stays in business...but on the upside if you want to go somewhere to read or work and don't want to be pressured to leave it's great for that."}
{"text":"Firstly.... how can you not love the name of this place!  

I'm newly interested in cider, especially if it is on the dry side.  So appreciated the focus on Ontario produced, beer, cider, & wine.  Was able to try and savour a 'new to me' cider.  Unfortunately the name of it escapes me.

The menu variety didn't knock our socks off but we enjoyed our meal.

My companion had the fish and chips, which was well enjoyed.  The portion size was decent and the hand cut fries, yummy.

I had the traditional burger.  It was flavourful and moist.  It was on the smaller side and good value for the price charged.   Again..... always appreciate hand cut fries done well."}
{"text":"Hm. On the upside, this place has an awesome name, and they let you sit and study for hours with no pressure, even if you just bought some tea. And there are various delicious-looking appetizers for $6-8.

On the downside, the tea costs too much, and most of the food is $10 - there's just a couple of the $6 appetizers, and there's nothing cheaper. Plus, I had a chicken sandwich and house salad, and while both were absolutely beautiful (beautiful!), neither actually tasted very exciting.

They also turned the lights way down at around 7pm, making studying after that impossible. And there weren't a lot of outlets. And the layout made me feel like I was at a desk in grammar school, and the grumpy hipster waiter was our omniscient schoolmarm.

As far as a place to grab a bite and a beer with friends, I'm sure I'll go here again. For studying, probably not."}
{"text":"Toronto has been a difficult Tequila town. Perhaps the distance from Mexico is too great. Perhaps  Mexico is pissed about canadien immigration policy, so they charge em up the ass for the liquid silver and gold...........
Oh great, a place with Tequila in the name. Like a magnet for the soul we ducked in for a pre-bike ride Margarita. Big mistake. The drinks were made with lemons, an ounce of agave syrup, a cheap tequila I have never seen in my life(that was on the top shelf), and a sprinkling of some un-marked bottle. The drinks were anything but top shelf. They tasted like lemonade with too much sugar. How is it  that a queen street joint can be so uninformed about the making of a margarita when it calls itself Tequila Bookworm. The bill for the 2 drinks was $27.00. 
Total fucking crime."}
{"text":"Last night  my wife and I headed for a pub I had heard about called Tequila Bookworm.  

The reason I wanted to go was that I had heard that they had a great selection of craft beers on tap. I was not disappointed. I started with a Beau's Harvest Ale which was fabulous and ended with a Spearhead Hawaiian Pale Ale, a beer which I will write about one day.

We both were hungry, so we both ordered burger and fries. The food was so good, I forgot to take a picture till the end.

The service was a little slow, mainly as on a Saturday night they had just the bartender doing everything. There is a second floor to Tequila Bookworm and I saw him run upstairs a couple of times. The mens washroom was a mess too.

I like the place though. The bartender although busy was friendly and I like the setup. We found a great table by the open rolled up door. Next time I plan to explore the upstairs.

Yes, I liked it enough to return and will likely hit there on a Friday night on the way home from work to read and have a couple of delicious pints."}
{"text":"The staff is incompetent...I'd like this beer...server brings different beer...no, this beer...server brings different beer...I'D LIKE THIS BEER....was typical of my first (and only) experience at this place...we had three servers...all of whom did something wrong...one had no idea what any of the menu items contained (the menu has like six things on it) and then totally got it wrong (told us the ice cream waffle had strawberries and blueberries and it arrived with chopped up apple)...the 2nd got my beer wrong twice...the 3rd messed up our bill...it was a parade of incompetence.

On the plus side, the food was ok...but not good enough to be worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I go into Tequila bookworm quite often to get coffee and work on their free WiFi. Staff is always very friendly, although somewhat casual in their attitude. (read - slow)

But the food is decent, and it's a nice relaxed place to go."}
{"text":"Probably the best bar on Queen West.

Friendly, cool, and knowledgeable staff.
Cocktails on tap (another Negroni, please!)
The entire food menu is great. I have had it all! Burgers, fish and chips (way, way better than average), chicken nuggets, and salads. 

I love this place. It is open during the day with wi-fi and coffee, too!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the neighbourhood and I think I just found my new favourite spot. I had some tasty apps to share with some friends over some delicious Belgian ale. Friendly and attentive service and fantastic music. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Cute place near Queen and Bathurst for a low-key bite to eat or a drink. There were two of us on a Friday night and not many seats available, but they gave us the 4-seater instead of squishing us next to another couple. This gesture was very much appreciated and one of those things that would make me go back instead of choose somewhere else next time. 

They've got a variety of salads and healthy food choices - hummus is really garlicky so watch out. ;)

The ambiance was great - low-lit and music that was loud enough to drown out the other people in the place but we could still hear each other without screaming. Hipster cool fun. Def. recommend."}
{"text":"This is going to be one of my new favourite spots.

Came here on a bar crawl night- ended up staying until last call. It was crowded, but not so much we couldn't find seats. It was also loud, but not so loud you couldn't have a conversation. The music kept the vibe going. Small(ish) but average bar, however, what made it so great (besides my company) were the great drinks, and the AWESOME bartender. They had good craft beer to choose from, and the bartender made us some great shots, and was very helpful in drink selections. Excellent, EXCELLENT service, and great variety and choices. Spent one of the most fun nights I've had in a while (that happened to be my birthday!) here. Drop in, even just for a drink! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am only giving Tequila Bookworm 3* because I've seen its rise, fall and plateau. I think it's hit a good space now, with improved service and better WiFi service. At one point, you could barely load a webpage at this place. I've been visiting TB for more than 5 years, first for their delish waffles and since for work-dates and meetings. The food is overpriced and often greasy -- you only eat here if you're irrepressibly hungry. Their brownies, however, are AMAZING and I regularly grab them for take out. I really only like this place 'cause the staff is cool and I like the chill setting. You can spend the whole day at Tequila, but I warn against organizing social gatherings here."}
{"text":"Tequila Bookworm, have a cuter name, I dare you. 

Spent a good few hours here the other day and felt totally at ease. Here's a place where you can definitely stay a while. They had plenty of true blue Canadian beers on tap, mysteriously missing my favourite- Mill Street Organic. But pay no mind to that, the server was quick to come up with a solution. Beau's it is! 

My tablemates didn't love their food. I didn't taste, so I can't get too into it. Just be wary that the \"burger\" is actually \"burgers\" AKA three small sliders. Nice to have a nice menu to munch from while grabbing a couple drinks. I also saw that they have a pretty nice coffee arrangement so that's another thing on my list to try. 

Take a book, buy a beer, drink a coffee, use that WIFI."}
{"text":"I have walked by Tequila Bookworm on many occasions always wanting to visit.  Finally, this week, a bunch of my colleagues and I headed over for our monthly pub night.  The atmosphere is a chillin'/laid back sort of vibe; there is an element of bookworm with the bookshelves filled with books around the room.

Be sure to check out their chalkboard with the latest specials when you enter.  They have an extensive craft beer & cider drinks menu.  Also they have food menu with typical bar fare to accompany your drinks.  

Service is great; they were able to accommodate our group of 10+ with no issues.

I will definitely be back for future nights out on Queen West!  Spot by if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. I don't know much about beer. They had a variety I wasn't familiar with. The burgers are good. I really like the patio upstairs too."}
{"text":"I ended up here on a Friday night with a group of 9 and it was a fun night. The ambience is loud/bar like but it was the food that surprised me. I wasn't expecting great food and ordered the Queen Burger, this was a really good burger and 3 more people ordered it after (and agreed).

The price was good and so was the food, perfect spot for a night our on a budget. 

Brown girl says, \"I'd like the Queen served on a platter please\"."}
{"text":"I've been to Tequila Bookworm a few times before for lunch when I worked close by. It's a chill place to go by yourself with a book or laptop, or to meet a friend.

Last night was my first time going in the evening; vibe was pretty much the same but with candles and louder music.

Things I like:

- The music is good- last night they were playing Neko Case, The XX, and Radiohead
- Food was delicious- I got a salmon platter and salad with generous portions, and my friend had a burger that she was raving about
- Prices for the food are decent
- Good location- it's easy to get to

Things I didn't like so much:
- The guy serving us had a stuck-up vibe, and seemed annoyed when we asked him questions about the beer on tap or asked him for salt
- My glass was empty for over half an hour before I was able to flag him down to get another drink (I should mention that it wasn't busy at all, so no excuses buddy)
- At one point my friend tried to get his attention so she could order another drink- she made eye contact but rather than coming over he just stared at her to the point where she got uncomfortable and looked away first
- I tried later to get his attention by saying \"hey\" as he walked by. He just said \"hey\" and kept walking over to the bar where he sat on the stool and started playing with his phone

So other than the random guy who clearly did not want to be spending his Wednesday evening working, it was an enjoyable spot."}
{"text":"I like this place! Reading some of the more recent reviews makes me sad since I have had a lot of good experiences.  I've been there with girlfriends to chat over tea and wine, classmates to study which turned into dinner and drinks, and even popped in for dinner.  Their burger is surprisingly really good, especially with their fries, and they have a variety of local beer on tap.   

It definitely fills the gap on the Queen W strip if you are looking for more than a coffee shop but less than dinner or a bar, although it can also serve as any of those things."}
{"text":"An assortment of rooms for every meeting, or personal tea-time. On two floors.  The main floor has frequent live jazz bands.  Free Wi-Fi.  It is called thus because of the literati who seem to come around often.  The Bookworm has book stacks on each floor.  A meeting place for artists and whacky types as well as professionals.  Beer and small foods too.  Mostly for the studentish nerds."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for grabbing a tea, coffee, milkshake, fruit smoothie, or a whole meal! Today's rave review, the creamy spinach soup du jour. 
They really have everything - salads, sandwiches, soup, burgers, waffles (huh?), alcohol, tea/coffee, fruit smoothies, milkshakes...the list goes on. Things are reasonably priced, and the meals all come with decent sides/things included. 

The atmosphere is good for chatting with friends or writing a few lyrics for the next big single to appear on Ryan Seacrest's top 40 (totally saw someone doing that tonight). Lots of small groups, but also a few people with laptops or quiet work to do on their own. 

The staff is lovely and food and drinks are served promptly. They are also open late, which is great if you're looking for a low-key hangout to drink rooibos or a sencha green tea. As Michelle A. and I discussed, us coffee 'nighthawks' like to dine late too!

All in all, most satisfactory indeed."}
{"text":"Tequila Bookworm is one of those rare dual purpose places where it's a coffee shop where you can hangout with your computer during the day and a loud Queen St. bar in the evening. Once I attended a private party for a DJ/T-shirt artist promo there, so that's another aspect to a spot. It's easy to find, at the foot of Portland, and a long time fixture in the neighbourhood. Their specialty is Ontario craft beer. As you come in the door, immediately to your right is a large chalkboard with a mouth-watering listing of local beers and ciders. I tried a Kensington Watermelon beer on tap and it made me crave a hot patio and more of it immediately! And I was most impressed by the helpful bartender who came out and was happy to show us the beer menu and provide any info that he could on their offerings du jour. They also promote their beers on a sidewalk board out front which I appreciate walking by and seeing what just came out. There is a staircase going upstairs to the right of the entrance which leads to a two-room layout. The front room had people in it, while the back room looked to be empty with no bar stocked, and looked quite interesting. A curtain stopped people from venturing up another level. There used to be a shelving system on the main floor along the left wall as you enter, but that is gone, maybe to make more space, and replaced by a bare wall displaying beautiful prints. We saw part of a fabulous series of photos, some of photography of sewers below Toronto, by Circuit Gallery. Nice! I didn't try the food, but the sign said kitchen open until 2 AM."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week. Service was great, very kind and welcoming. Offered good beer suggestions. Vibe is warm and cozy whilst still being urban and interesting. Noise level was good on a Friday night (busy and upbeat, good music, but could still hold a conversation). I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Great spot on Queen street for food and drinks. I've been coming here on and off for a few years.
Last time I came by with a friend and had tacos and a pint of Cameron's One eyed Grouse which was delicious.
The tacos were very good, three tacos for 10 bucks is a good deal, and the cod taco especially was delicious.
My friend ordered a burger. She said it was really good, and probably one of the best she'd had in a long time.
If you like new craft beers, this is a good place to come with some friends and have a pint or two. The service is friendly, and the atmosphere is super laid back, which I feel is pretty rare with the new craft beer bars.
Though the beer list is a bit intimidating at first, the server was nice and explained to us all the beers we had questions about, and made some good recommendations without the usual incomprehensible jargon.
They also have an upstairs part which has some cool furniture and decor and I think they rent it out for events. 
Also, they have a huge local Ontario cider list! I think it's one of the largest in the area. My friend loves ciders and was really impressed with the West Avenue cider they had on tap. They have two ciders on tap and many more in bottles.
Overall, probably one of my favorite places in the city to come with some friends and drink good local beer and have some food."}
{"text":"I ordered a Dolins vermouth on the rocks, my first drink entering the bar with a orange peel, the bartender filled my glass to the brim with ice and gave me a 1 ounce pour. You have got to be kidding me, this bottle most likely cost $9 which is not the point, just stating it.  This was not an expensive whiskey or tequila on the rocks, it's more like a glass of wine. Leaving after this"}
{"text":"This bar has a great layout. The walls of books behind bar ( which I'm told is more for show but u can read if u want to) makes a very cozy environment. It's pretty small so it's best for an intimate outing, but not for any private or deep convos since it gets pretty loud. Drinks are on the pricier side, but good selection and options. Great location, great for a nightcap."}
{"text":"Read it was a good place to work but it's not. Not designed like a cafe to  work despite being called \"bookworm\".

Personally I found the place to be too grungy and dirty to be comfortable, and the staff was dressed and behaved too casually for me to take the food seriously. But everyone seems to be friend so I feel bad giving them 1 star, don't see any reason to come by."}
{"text":"The first sunny Friday of the spring and they staffed one poor guy for both up and downstairs.  10min for beer..  refused our order saying he would come back but never came back in the next 25 we sat there."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant coffee shop.  
when I walked in I thought it was an order at the bar cafe.  Soon found out that the super attentive staff did table service.
Studied here for a couple hours and enjoyed a very averagely good brunch and espresso.  Would come here again.
At first I felt a little weird loitering with my computer studying in a place with table service, but the staff was very nice, even bringing me water once he saw i was done my coffee.

The place could be a bit cleaner, but I've come to not expect too much from Toronto places."}
{"text":"A dump. Yet, one of my secret hiding places. You see, years ago, I used to come to Tequila Bookworm's old location which was about a block east. Such an excellent hide out! 

Okay, so let me tell you, in its current iteration, Tequila Bookworm gets three stars NOW but it gets one more due to my personal and biased memories of the place.  

The place was so interesting back then... No sign upfront to tell you the name of the place because %#@^%$#$ capitalism. Once you walked in, a long Cafe was before you. A coffee/liquor bar to he left, with stools for you to chill at, a magazine rack to the right, where if you bought anything from them you were allow to browse and take back to your table(!). In the back three couches and a number of small tables with three huge (8-10 feet high) bookcases on each wall, shock full of books as a backdrop. Which you could pick and browse at your leisure. 

I used to go there with one of my best friends, have a coffee and smoke cigarettes (yes, it was that long ago) and just chill and talk about art, girls, work and school. What an awesome place it was!

Then it changed, and then, changed again. So now Tequila Bookworm is a little bit lost. 
They want to retain their Avant-garde vibe they had before, however the first floor now feels and looks like any other indie Cafe I have gone in Queen street West, or Dundas West or on Leslie or at the Junction or pretty much anywhere else. So that vibe they had before is kinda gone. Yes, they are down with the usual and cliché art photography hanging from the walls and the small wall of books that now just seems, well, almost forced.  

They try to have live music and other artistic events, which do help, however again it feels a bit on the forced side now, and on their second floor, they have a patio, which is welcomed during the Summer, yet feels like a musky, dirty old house where you are supposed to have your coffee there during winter months. So ironically, the size upgrade has negatively affected its old cozy factor. 

Also, this place used to be a chillin' spot, not a laptop hobo depot. Which anyone will tell you will hurt your art/creative cred if you got a bunch of hipsters & yuppies (sorry hipsters and yuppies) hanging around taking up your space. So instead of ongoing conversations you got tables filled with people, by themselves, staring into screens. With their glowing Apple logos facing you, reminding you that you can't seat there, almost as if saying \"Can't seat here dude, 'cause you know, I am like, so creatin' over here!\" 

Come on! That's what Starbucks are for!

I know they say that memories are horribly biased and I am sure I am experiencing just that. 

Is Tequila Bookworm a bad place? No. Is it as good as it used to be? Nope. 

Since right now it feels like it wants to be a bit of everything to everyone. However when one shoots for that and misses, you end up being not the best at anything for anyone. 

Check the place out though. It definitely deserves a look, you might like it, specially if you live in the hood. Too bad it is no longer my hiding spot. :-(
 
PS:. Although a bit out of tune, I enjoyed coming down and playing the piano on the second floor while sipping on my coffee. That used to be fun!"}
{"text":"Great new menus, an a huge beer menu which is always a hit with people who drink it (i'm not a beer drinker). I work here during the day with my laptop and take up a spot on the patio upstairs or near the open window. Great people watching, friendly staff who's happy to get to know you, and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"While some friends and I were in town for work we happened to stumble into Tequila Bookworm. The place itself has such a cool vibe to it. Their beer selection was impressive and our server was very knowledgable. We ordered the brisket poutine (brisket, BBQ sauce, jalapeños, cheese) but we skeptical because we're from Texas and Texas knows brisket. Damn that was good brisket. The sauce was fantastic. The jalapeños were a great touch. The chunks of real cheese made me happy. I like poutine but nasty, processed cheese curds will ruin it for me. I'm not a local so I don't know how this place fares in comparison to other gastro pubs in Toronto but I loved it. I suggest stopping by if you're in the area. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What makes this café interesting is it's aura and friendly service. It's conveniently located in the heart of Toronto's fashion district on Queen West (near Bathurst Street) and can be easily accessed by street car.

Tequila Bookworm is a perfect hang out if you like reading, chilling and watching the world go by. Also, if you're looking for a venue for an event, they have two party rooms that are super for private events and available at an affordable cost. So, for a place that offers a chilled environment, coffee + desserts, and a bar, you can't go wrong to pick this spot to spend your day caught up in your own world.

Definitely one of my fave Toronto cafes."}
{"text":"Wow, I see I'm not the only one! Service is yes, dreadfully slow esp when I've been there on a weekend morning. And I used to dig their rosti potato pancake thing they serve with brunch until it made an appearance as raw shredded potato one meal-ewww. But yeah, not a bad place to bring your laptop along and waste a few hours of the day off...."}
{"text":"I liked this little bar. The uncomfortable booth seats, the dim lights, the somewhat attentive service, the choices of mismatched items decorating the interior, and the music playing just loud enough you can't hear the table next to you is saying, the dark moody atmosphere. These might sound like negative things, but to me, it gave it character. Something like a shitty, hole-in-the-wall bar that served slightly overpriced beer with a hipster flair.

I might have given it a higher rating if they had Guinness and if they had known how to pour it but alas, it's still a solid 3/5 in my books. I might stumble in here again on my way to Poutini House of Poutine.

Parking: Limited paid street parking
Price: $
Wait: 5 mins after ordering"}
{"text":"Complete shite.

I ordered a simple, easy breakfast...two eggs overeasy with homesfries, bacon and toast. Probably the easiest breakfast you can make or get unless you eat a banana for breaky.

The eggs came over hard-as-nails, 1 slice of toast, 2 scrappy pieces of bacon(undercooked) and a tiny portion of homefries...all for 11.50.

a 12 dollar breakfast should be more or at the bare minimum at least be well cooked, half decent food.

I found it really overpriced, bad food and bad service (I waited 40 minutes for the breakfast on top of waiting 20 minutes to get a coffee).

Avoid unless you have money to burn, time to kill and want to leave still feeling hungry."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good place to chill that's open late and remotely close to where I work, and so far Tequila Bookworm is at the top of my list. I haven't tried their coffee yet, because every time I come here I'm impressed enough by their beer selection that I decided on that route.

I really enjoy their music choice, their use of books as decor theme, and the level and quality of crowd ambience. It's not so loud that I get distracted as I work, but not so quiet that I lose focus in a lack of white noise.

The food I've had here is pretty good and well-priced. I haven't had issues with the staff, as other people have, but I've always showed up in groups of one or two. You have to wait for them to come to you, but beyond that I've been happy with the service."}
{"text":"The 'Worm was on my bucket list of bars to check out so decided to meet a pal here for drinks tonight. Reading some reviews of trusted Yelp'er's, I was excited to check out their extensive beer selection. Unfortunately I'm on antibiotics at the moment so I was able to only enjoy their fine selection of diet cola.

I can't speak for the drinks or food, but I really enjoyed the vibe of this place. A hole in the wall, it's a cozy bar on Queen West. There are high tables along with regular ones; I saw a few groups here so you can come here with a lot of friends. 

I would like to come back to check out their food as the menu looked pretty good.

Be warned: if coming here by TTC, don't bother with the streetcar. It's much faster to walk from Osgoode. #thishasnothingtodowiththeworm

Good for: drinks, groups"}
{"text":"This place is like going over to your buddies apartment... cozy, warm and inviting.... internet access if you wanna do work, open late, staff are awesome and chill/down to earth, no douchbagness that seems to linger over toronto's west end, non predacious  as well, gets louder/ more barish on weekend nights, upstairs there are events and an Xbox360... lol I dunno, cute little patio to... food is ok... amazing beer selection tho. good hang out spot, grab a seat by the window on a sunny day and ppl watch!"}
{"text":"I found out about these guys from a Toronto.com article on favourite cafes, but on the day I went they were not serving any espresso-based drinks and their drip coffee was very poor. Service was kinda nebulous (we wondered if we had in fact actually been served, even after our order was taken) and the organic burger that eventually arrived was pretty dry. Fries were good, and the atmosphere and the space have some appeal, but my overall impression was pretty negative."}
{"text":"We went in the evening for dinner and the music was obnoxiously loud. The food took quite a while to arrive (didn't help that we were starving).

For what turned out to be an $11 kale salad was a tiny portion (chicken was an extra 3 dollars). It was pretty good but I was expecting a lot more for an $11 salad. It was served with hazelnuts and for $11...I would've assumed they would at least crush the hazelnuts instead of just throwing them in whole. I had difficulty picking that up with a fork. 

What's more upsetting is that AFTER I ate the salad and left the place I realized they gave me ARUGULA not KALE. I paid 11 dollars for an ARUGULA salad. I was so hungry that I didn't realize they didn't give me what I paid for. It's kinda my fault because I ate it all and couldn't go back and complain but at the same token, I shouldn't have had to wait so long for a salad let alone the wrong salad.

My boyfriend got the pulled pork and it was delicious. Again, just the portions were small. The two other guys we came with were also underwhelmed. Their food was good but for the price it was unreasonably small.

So frustrating."}
{"text":"In reading these reviews, I'm a bit surprised that a few people have had bad service.  I've never had that problem there, but when I think about it, I've only ever been there for coffee.  Which I've enjoyed.

Tequila Bookworm is a cozy spot.  During the day, you'll often find it filled with people writing, drawing, reading, or doing whatever on their laptops.  It makes it a bit of a strange experience, because alot of those people aren't talking to themselves.  It's not that seeing people focused on work is a strange sight.  It's more that so many people practically use this place as a studio space (I exaggerate.)

One time when I was here, the upstairs was being used for a launch party for 2 different comic books.  It was cool to see the place decorated like a mini gallery.  I don't know what the rules are about hosting something like this, but I've seen it done, so clearly they allow it to happen.  Might be worth looking into if you want a cozy space for a party."}
{"text":"LOCATION: just fine - cool restaurant and shopping street close walk from my hostel.
VIBE: nice! cool slinky/sultry modern R&B over sparse dreamy beats. Decorations not too busy or loud. Friendly and not overbearing staff.
FOOD: Pretty nice - I had BBQ pork poutine, co-eater had chicken tenders and we shared a salad. No problems with any of it. Would definitely eat again.
DRINKS: Good selection, not too pricey. Local beers and ciders, which is nice."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a few friends and it's a great spot to catch up but I did find the food lacking some flavour and sauce.

It had a really cool decor though and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Really nice cozy place in the heart of downtown toronto. The host is suer friendly and helpful. The food was so tasty. Overall really good experience for a middle of the day experience in queen street."}
{"text":"Decent service. Pretty good beer selection. The atmosphere wasn't comfortable. We also had one glass that had a ring of sludge around the bottom that we didn't notice until we got down to it. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I used to go here when it was in it's old location.  In it's new location it isn't really the same.  What once felt like a used bookstore that sold coffee, ice cream and waffles now feels like a Queen West Cafe.  That said, it is a Queen West Cafe so I'll cut it some slack.  I don't find the service to be as bad as others have and the coffee is pretty good; smooth and not bitter.  I wouldn't think of it as a destination as I once did, but I would pop back in if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Best beer and atmosphere hands down. No joke. Food is good here too, unashamedly pub food, but high quality for that type"}
{"text":"I`ve heard so much about the way the place once was. So not fair for us newbies to Toronto.

I was intrigued to hit this place up because of the freakin`name.  Seriously, people. In my head, even if I didn`t drink tequila, read books or liked worms - you have to visit this name just because of the name.

That aside, I had expected something a bit more rustic and I guess, full of more books. I started to create ideas in my head about how more `library-like`it could look.

The coffee I had was nothing special nor was the specialty coffee which for the life of me I can`t remember what it was. Probably not a good sign.

We had great customer service for our table though. I have no idea if that was because we were right across from the  server but I was pleased.

Would I go here again? I`m neither here or there on it.  If someone wanted to go sure. If there was a downpour and I had to duck into someplace, yeah.

I feel as if the space it once was, is somewhere I probably would have enjoyed."}
{"text":"#TORONTO #TEQUILA #BAR

Pricey and enjoyably pretentious. And no tequila shot specials. 

Pricey: 
1. Beer/cider specials started at $7. I am used to specials starting at $4. 
2. Cocktails started at $12. No specials.

Enjoyably Pretentious:
1. Water served in a tequila bottle.
2. Attractive hipster men with their JD Salingers or Chuck Palahnuiks. And a glass of beer.
3. Attractive servers that tell you tales of beer and cider and bring you glasses for a taste-and-pick scenario. 
4. Books on shelves, far from reach, high up, close to the ceiling. 
5. On Queen Street.

Coming back if/when I am single. Totally want to pick up a guy reading that book I like."}
{"text":"Where is the service?

i thoroughly enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and comfy feel, but this is where it stops.

i went there with a couple of friends.  i ordered a cold dish, the lox and bagel platter, while my friends ordered hot dishes.  needless to say, they got their food before me.  then i watched as the other waiter served my dish to a couple that had come in after us.  i saw my waiter tell the other waiter that the dish was supposed to be for out table.  i then preceded to wait 45 more mintues for my dish, before we had to ask if my food was still coming.  this on top of the 20 minutes after we had ordered.  over a hour wait for a cold dish is ridiculous.  this takes the 'relaxed atmosphere' to an extreme.

i will never go here again and will always walk by with distaste.  there coffee is ok i guess."}
{"text":"I would easily rank Tequila Bookworm as one of the best pubs in the city. The vibe is amazing, the beer selection is aces, and the food is delicious.

On this particular visit, I tried a superb IPA called Bear Hug and ate the joint's Traditional Poutine (\"beef gravy, quebec cheese curds, green peppercorns, chives\").

It's an incredibly simple dish that's done so, so well. For one thing, it's a much bigger portion than I was expecting. I shared the dish with my dining companion and it was more than enough food.

But beyond portion size, this is just an absolutely flawless poutine. As good as the fries and gravy are, the dish's success is due mostly to the extremely generous portion of cheese contained within. The poutine has been assembled in such a way as it contains curds all the way to the bottom, thus ensuring that there's hardly a forkful that doesn't feature ooey, gooey cheese. It's magnificent.

The service was quick and attentive, too. What a place."}
{"text":"In recent weeks I've come here a few times and each experience has satisfied me. 

This place has changed owners so many times that it's hard to keep track. Or, maybe it's just the staff that has changed but I feel like I've interracted with some nice people so far that it makes for a positive experience.

I like coming here when I want to get some work done and have a pint of beer to go along with it. Most patrons who are there do the same. It's not too quiet to feel awkward about every sound you make and it's not too loud to be able to concentrate. Heck, I've even interviewed someone for an article I was writing so it's a comfortable setting to work in. 

Until a few days ago, I hadn't tried any of the food until my friend Georgie and I came here one evening and ordered waffles. 

You must try them! 

Think sliders for desserts. Mini waffles with an assortment of berries, maple syrup and for a few extra bucks, a generous dollop of Kawartha Lakes ice cream. 

I'm definitely ordering them again when I've got an article deadline breathing down my neck."}
{"text":"Tequila was ok. Not much selection. Very loud rap music playing. No chips and salsa. Flavorless Onion rings. All in all bad experience. Would not return."}
{"text":"I love Tequila Bookworm. It's a great casual hangout spots for drinks.

The service is always friendly and efficient. 

The pours are generous and the drink are great (as well as cheap), which is awesome.

The only reason I gave Tequila Bookworm a 4 stars is the food, especially the nachos. It is not bad but it is not what I expected the taste to be like. It is too sweet and has a slight curry flavour which is a bad surprise for someone that hates curry."}
{"text":"This seems to be the only good cafe in Toronto that:

- is in a central location
- is open late
- serves booze
- has free wi-fi
- isn't too loud so that you can't get some work done

And they have good beer on tap. If a place serves Beau's, I'm a fan. They have a food menu too, but I am yet to partake. Looks good though."}
{"text":"This was one of a few pub-crawl destinations that was on the list for the night and we all arrived before 11pm.  I think Tequila Bookworm was a destination because they took reservations, which is nice when planning a pub-crawl for 8+ people.  

I came here with a few drinks in my system and continued with a few more standard drinks.  No complaints about the drinks and the table service was good.  We noticed that the music was a bit loud for a sit-down pub.  My review is mainly for their tacos.  Firstly, it wasn't really that cool that they didn't know exactly what was in their tacos and whether it had gluten (not a good sign).  I don't have a gluten allergy, but my friend does so I decided to order it anyway.  

3 tacos for $10 is a good deal.  The tacos were really small, and was a good pub-hopping snack.  There was 1 fish taco and 2 meat tacos.  I have to say that they were a bit too bland for my liking, but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Food was ok/good but service was totally brutal. 

Also, there was no tea! If you have brunch til 5pm you're sort of putting yourself out there as a hub for brunch, which means supplying the fundamental beverages is expected."}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at Tequila Bookworm.

Their beer and cider menu is local.  Gord likes it there because of all the craft beer selections.

Gord ordered 12 Chicken Nuggets.  They looked good and Gord said they were.  He'd get them again.

I ordered a Fried Chicken Sandwich (with no lettuce) and fries.  The sandwich was really good and I'd get it again.  The fries were just okay.

Tom was the bartender and our server.  He was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Breakfast, coffee, tea, free wifi, rnb and hip-hop in the background, laid back, friendly crew, space itself big enough to give you plenty of room, Tequila Bookworm is perfect for the bookworms in the morning and should be alright for some drinks later too."}
{"text":"A neat little two story bar which serves up some solid craft beer options while belting out some solid tunes. I suggest stopping by and sitting out in the upstairs patio if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This place has changed hands and as a result my two favorite menu items disappeared.  The live jazz disappeared.  And the last two times I went in there it was hotter than outside in summer...I had to leave because I STARTED to sweat when I went in there.  I was a regular patron here for a while and there are so few cafes open late in Toronto that it's a shame to cross this one off the list of tenable work cafes, but so be it.  

Maybe these are growing pains and the place will be better than it ever was in a few months (which will also be when the city starts freezing instead of melting).  Maybe I'll find then."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Tequila Bookworm....sigh...there is so much to say about the Worm. It has a lot of history and has had about three reincarnations. Its current state I think is one of identity crisis as some have pointed out. Here's the history: was a great, eclectic cafe before it moved and kind of retained that status until it changed. Then it became lap top central and not as focused on its book/magazine selection. Now owned by the very lovely Jeff who worked his way up the ranks and is a good manager but needs to pick one vision. 

I get where Jeff is coming from (my assumption): don't want to lose the old cafe, lap top toting clientele that made the cafe what it was but wants to make money because when you have 50 people sitting at a cafe for 8 hours taking up your capacity, you're not exactly turning a profit. There are more deuces but that said, I miss the old decor a little bit. It made it more unique; more Queen street. 

Now that the Portland Centre with corporate names are across the street, I'm curious as to how and if Tequila survives. But I want it to because it was such a great place. It just needs to be ONE THING. or Two distinct things. 

I am the said lap topper but I don't work here anymore because 1. I'm on the other side of the city working and no longer freelancing. 2. it's loud with the music and I can't guarantee if I'll get any work done. So I'd rather go somewhere that I can rely on. 

I wonder where my fellow patrons have gone as well or if they still come because Tequila was (is?) such a great melting pot of young, vibrant creative souls (as aloof as we all are). 

And a NOTE: Can I just say how awesome it is to have a cafe to work after 11 pm is?! That is central?! It's really a plus and one thing that sets Tequila apart from the competition. I cannot say how many times they have saved me when I couldn't focus at home. 

I EAT/DRINK
They have a lovely ginger tea here. Their walnut, asiago salad was my fave back in the day; then the fave changed to the salmon and cream cheese plate with lots of capers. And their desserts are tasty...make sure you get one of those waffles. Delish! 

That said, in the summer it's great to kick back a brew on their rooftop patio. Another way that you can easily spend hours here. 


OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I miss this place. I truly do. It was one of my Toronto landmarks. And I hope that its new incarnation can be as addictive to a new clientele as it was to its old one, especially with the changing landscape and gentrification of Queen Street West."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Great for date nights, studying, drinks with the girls, whatever.  Best beer and cider list in this area (I'm sure some hipster will question that, but there it is...) And George the server is SOOOO great... and hot, just sayin'."}
{"text":"Great small low-key bar with a good selection of microbrew beers on tap. Have not tried to food here but definitely looking to come back at some point."}
{"text":"To be fully honest, I came here because of their name. A bar name couldn't describe my personality more accurately. I had to pay this spot a visit. The first spot on a long night of bar-hopping down Queen St. W, I remember this spot the best! 

My gal pal and I only planned on coming here for one drink, but thanks to the lovely bartender, we ended up staying for a bit more. I first started out with an IPA - I asked the bartender what his favourite kind was and told him to pour that. I actually don't even know what it was, but it hit the spot! I was going to get another beer, but Mr. Bartender decided it was time for shots and poured me and my gal pal a few rounds. Thus began a long, long, adventurous night. 

If I lived in Toronto, I feel like I would come here quite often. I just love the atmosphere of the place. It's dimly lit by a few twinkle lights and candles. It's fairly small, only a few tables and a large bar. One wall is lined with books and the other lined with alcohol (specifically, tequila) bottles. Hence the name. And the staff is some of the friendliest I've met. There were only 2 of them working the night I came in and they had to cater to all the other tables around us, so service might be a bit slower. But who cares? Enjoy your company, surroundings, and drink casually. 

Plenty of decent beers on tap. Also a good list of cocktails from what I could see. Hats off to you, Tequila Bookworm."}
{"text":"Firstly .. just chill out.  Don't be in a hurry.  Don't complain about the old loveseat or rickety wooden tables or tight/steep staircase down to a shithole of a bathroom ... despite all of that, this place is still great :)
it's a queen west vibe, so enjoy it.
serves booze :)"}
{"text":"I'm being generous, here. I would rather give 1.5 stars, but can't. 

A quick perusal of the reviews would indicate that this is a once venerable establishment that has gone to the dogs. As I recently moved into the neighborhood, I figured I would check it out anyway. A beautiful spring day, the garage door at the front open to the street; it seemed a good day to check it out.

Well, being a little light in the pocket, after review of the drink menu, I order a bottle of beer from the cheapest grouping on the menu. Ooooooh, says the girl behind the counter, I don't think we carry that any more. OK. So a different brand. Oooooh, we're out of that. Actually, we don't have ANY beer at that price. OK, so up to the next price level on the menu. Actually, all of those beers are $0.50 more than indicated on the menu. OK, then. Well, now we're into pint prices, so let's look at pints. 2 price points, domestic and \"premium.\" Looking at the taps, I'll be dam*ed if I can tell which is which. And I am a beer drinker's beer drinker. They're all Ontario micro brews (I think, anyway). Seems this is because there is one \"domestic\" brand, despite what the menu says. 

At this point, I look at the girl like \"WTF is the point of your menu?\" It's computer printed paper in a plastic sleeve. A monkey could fix this problem for the entire establishment in 30 minutes. Are you telling me this place is run so badly that even monkeys could do a better job? It would seem so.

To top it off, the girl poured my pint with the tap *in* my beer. Anyone who has ever tended bar knows this is a huge no-no.

It's a decent space. Too bad it's completely wasted."}
{"text":"I guess this place has been an institution for a while, but I hadn't heard any of the hype.  I simply walked past it a couple of times during my initial wanderings around the city, and chuckled to myself re: the name.

Recently, a friend and I wanted to hangout and chat out late on QW, but were avoiding alcohol - this pretty much eliminated bars, and other coffee shops (closed).  This turned out to be just the place for us.  The atmosphere was lively, but didn't overwhelm our conversation.  The other patrons looked like they were having a great time, but weren't disruptive and actually  contributed greatly to the fun late night feel of the establishment.  The only thing is that we ordered tea, and got poorly disguised sigh of resignation from the staff; his disappointment that we weren't ordering booze or some other offering with higher margins didn't escape us.  Oh well - maybe next time buddy!  

We didn't need anything else, so I can't comment too much more on the service; except to say that our desire to pay our $5 bill completely escaped the attention of the staff.  We eventually made a big show of putting on our coats and lingered by the cash register.  Can't say it bothered me too much though; I still had a fun time with my friend, and I'm going to chalk up the service to a general disaffected hipster attitude (i.e. it wasn't personal).

 Cute atmosphere: B+, Service: meh"}
{"text":"Sometimes coffee just would not do it! On a hot summer afternoon, I need a cold pint of beer!

Tequila Bookworm is just a perfect place for me when I want a quick pint or even linger a little longer to use their wifi and Yelp a little.

Love the chalkboard that tells me exactly what's available on tap (all priced at $7) instead of asking for the lone bartender what's available. Though there are only 10 selections but that's a lot better than other business! 

The music though was a little loud even during afternoon and no AC so can be quite muggy on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"SLOWEST. SERVICE. EVER.

My first trip to Tequila Bookworm, I loved it. I had a delicious brunch, an omelet stuffed with avocado that made my life better. The service was slow, but I had time. 

The next Sunday, I wanted more. So I came again, with a different person. Whose order they completely forgot about. My food came, and my friend's did not. There were no apologies (Really? You don't even feel bad about screwing up at your job?), no offers for something free to make up for the fact that he now would have to stare at my food and sit there hungry.

Then we had to wait for someone to acknowledge us so we could PAY FOR THE FOOD.

I always see people sitting in the window on laptops, having a grand old time. That's who Tequila Bookworm is good for -- people who have computers to entertain them for the hours it will take to get food or even be noticed by the staff.

Never again."}
{"text":"We walked in and the guy said \"sit wherever you like!\" so we sat at one of the two open spots, then he came over and asked us to move to a smaller seat since we were at a table for 4 and the other open table was a table for 2. I don't mind moving but why even say sit wherever you want. Anyway, no big deal just kind of annoying. Food was ok, nothing great but service was horrible. The wait for food was extremely long and we had to ask 3 times to get our bill.

This place is for hipsters beware. There are fun hipsters and then pretentious hipsters. This place imho is for the latter"}
{"text":"Like a worm in a bottle of mescal Tequila Bookworm is just there. Idly floating at the corner of Queen West and Portland. You're not really sure what to think when you walk into this place. It's a coffeeshop but they're licensed, so it's a bit of a bar too. They also do brunch. What is this place?

Whatever it is, it's a pretty chill spot to curl up with a laptop and a coffee. They have lots of two tops and a wall full of paperbacks, though it's mostly shitty unreadable stuff like John Saul or The English Patient or Dragon's Egg. And with a garage door that opens wide, I imagine it's a fun place come summer and ogle the passersby on Queen West.

I haven't tried enough of the options on their menu to give it a really solid assessment, but I know that I will come here again.

Obligatory Title Pun: Forget early birds: this WORM is for night owls.

Menu Readability: I don't think I've ever looked at a menu here.

Need to mention: This cafe is open LATE! Huzzah.

What this place teaches me about myself: I love any place open past 10pm."}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't come here more often. It has a great easy going vibe, tasty snacks, an excellent beer list, free wifi, and at least one other person sitting there doing exactly what you are doing. Whether its meeting a friend for a drink, gathering a group of people, or sitting alone with a laptop and pint, I've never felt like the odd woman out here. 

My most recent visit deserves a special shout out to the Brussels sprouts. Batter-less, deep fried, and with all the umami (sesame, ginger, and hoisin), they had me scarfing them even faster than the fries. Whats that? I choose veggies over fries? Seven-year-old me would be aghast, but its true. It also helps that the beer I picked was the perfect pairing. The Wizard of Gose sour from Bandit is top notch. Its nice to know you can source the suds from that brewery even without heading all the way to Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"Something's changed about this place in recent years - perhaps it's the shift to a new location, I'm not really sure. I used to love how quaint and friendly the experience was but lately the staff is inattentive verging on rude and the quality of the food leaves much to be desired. Some quality control is definitely required!"}
{"text":"What's not to like? This is craft beers paradise. Awesome decor, staff is friendly and knows it's beers, music and crowd are great. First visit yesterday after hearing about it, and they deserve they reputation."}
{"text":"Tequila Bookworm is adorable. It is a perfect bar for a winter happy hour, thanks to it's high level of coziness and their before-5pm beer deals. Lots of delicious rotating taps, a little but decent wine list, cocktails and completely edible snacks. No gimmicks, just a nice little bar."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I love Queen West. Always have and always will. I like the chill vibe, character, history and constant transformations happening. For years, I had been meaning to come to Tequila Bookworm because I'm a huge craft beer fan girl. Like. I totally geek out over a solid craft beer selection.

I've been here a few times over the past 6 months and I've been underwhelmed. The draught list is definitely notable and ever-changing which is an impressive feat. Unfortunately, the service isn't super great. Definitely has a that negative \"hipster\" vibe at times. 

I have yet to try the food but the beer offerings will keep me coming back because I'M OBSESSED!"}
{"text":"It's hard to notice this spot at the name isn't displayed well. I've passed it numerous times walking up and down queen street W. I finally went in and was happy I did. We sat on their cozy roof top patio. We only ordered apps but we loved them! The calamari was one of the best we've had in a long time. Some pieces were on the salty side but altogether really yummy. You can also get fresh dips; 1 for $7 or all 3 for $15. We decided to get all three. We got a whole HEEP of dips along with fresh tortillas chips. We got so much dip we weren't able to finish it. It's rare you go to restaurants and can get that much guac. Also, they have a large selection of ciders which I loved. The waiter recommended a dry floral one which was delicious! Would definitely go again. Reason for my 4 stars is that they need more servers for late night especially in the summer. We did have to wait some time for our order. Other than that, I'd definitely recommend checking them out!"}
