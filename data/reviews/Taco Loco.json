{"text":"I found it very hard to find good Mexican fast-food in Champaign-Urbana... then, I ran into some of the best tacos al pastor in town!  These are of the small, gently fried, double-tortilla with cebolla y cilantro variety.  These compare with the tacos from Los Comales in Chicago.   I agree with others that the name and location are deceptive.  I drove by it many times before giving it a chance."}
{"text":"Edit: out of business, declined in quality.   Try MAIZE in Campustown for the best Mexican.  What I ordered: Steak Tacos - best  tortillas I've found in the area- fresh, moist, pliable and flavorful. The toppings were fresh and the portions generous. Three different kinds of salsas are kept in a fridge near the pickup window- which means the owners are concerned and knowledgeable about food safety.   Bonus: the restaurant was spotless- as was the bathroom- always a good sign!   Edit: Returned again. This time ordering a ribeye sope and enchilada combo plate with rice and beans. The sopes are good and the rice was moist and the beans flavorful. I would pass on the enchilada, or order it with a different sauce. Everything benefits from sprinkled cilantro and a squeeze of the just sliced lime provided. I asked the woman behind the counter- the cheese is imported and unfortunately, because I'm pregnant had to pass on it. My husband said it was good- it looked like queso fresco. It looks like they use mexican \"Crema\"- not sour cream- also a good sign (again, imported and had to pass on it, but my husband said it was good).   This is a solid taqueria- casual and cheap food. You won't find gourmet Mexican food, like mole, and it's not as good as you'll find in Chicago, but for C-U- this is as good as it gets. MUCH better than El Charro or the Dos Reales that people seem to like- for their nachos and margaritas..."}
{"text":"Taco Loco is my favorite place to go in town for tacos. Authentic Mexican style tacos with the soft corn tortilla, onions and cilantro on top! They don't \"bland down\" the flavor to suit the midwestern tongue, like a lot of local Mexican restaraunts do. Very tasty and reasonably priced! The atmosphere- OK it's like a school cafeteria, so not the place to bring a date. But if you want to chow down on some tasty authentic Mexican style food this place rocks! Also they have Mexican Coke and a number of other bottles/cans of Mexican sodas available as well. And if the food puts you in the mood to listen to some tunes from south of the border they even sell CD's here. OK that's kind of weird, but still cool. Anyway- I give their tacos 5 stars, their burritos are great but could be bigger and their salsa is kind of average. But as taquieros go- great!"}
{"text":"hey man, its located in a strip mall so dont expect anything spectacular apart from the food.  again, good prices and tasty tacos (with many types of meat) what more do you want.  only thing is that they are pretty excessive on cheese when in comes to quesadilios, also cheesy is the tabasco wallpaper, but maybe thats what makes it loco."}
{"text":"If you're only buying the tacos at taco loco, I'd give it 5 stars easy.  It's also in a very odd location out past the mall, so you have to have it in mind and make the trek out there.  It's worth it, though.  They have outstanding tacos.  They are very simple with no gimmicks---great tortillas, some tomato and onion, some cilantro and your choice of meat.  My particular favorite is the chorizo--very good.  I have to give the place 4 stars, however, because I don't think the rest of their fare matches up their tacos.  So stick with the tacos here, get three, and have a great lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite restaurant. Alambres, extra spicy... Forever! Edgar is the best. Miss this place terribly."}
{"text":"I love Taco Loco most for the elote.  As a long-time Chicagoan, their sopes help with my cravings from my old neighborhood joint, but they are not quite as good as those in Chicago's Logan/Palmer Square."}
{"text":"I've been a few times.  The tacos are the stars, as you would expect from the name.  I have tried the chicken and lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and the chorizo burrito.    The chorizo burrito was pretty good, full of salty, oily ground meat.  No beans inside, just meat  and some veggies, so if that is how you like your burritos, you'll be happy.    The tacos are the best, though.  Like Mas Amigos, they are served on corn tortillas with onions, cilantro, tomato.  The veggies are fresh and tasty.  The chicken is not bad, a little bland, but there is hot sauce and pickled jalepenos to fix that.    The lengua is the best and I recommend it even if you don't consider yourself an adventurous eater.  If no one told you it was tongue, it would just seem like slightly salty, slighty fatty, tender beef.  It goes perfectly with the corn tortillas and veggies and it's the way to go.  I haven't tried the tortas, but I'd like to in the future.  Service is usually pretty quick.  Prices are reasonable, I think.  Makes a good snack while doing shopping over on Prospect."}
{"text":"Taco Loco is probably my favorite restaurant in Champaign, period. It's a very unassuming place tucked in between the Regency Beauty Academy and the Armed Forces Recruiting Center, out between the mall and the North Prospect shopping area.   If you are looking for greasy food smothered in orange cheese, this is not the place for you, because the food here is NOT smothered in orange cheese, nor is it greasy.  As far as I know, Taco Loco is the only place in town to get sopes, which are an absolute favorite of mine. Think: a fried cornmeal cup, filled with meat, then topped with cheese and sour cream. Not the healthiest choice, but YUM. Their two-sope special is one of my regular meals here. I also love their tamales (good balance of masa and meat) and their tacos. 99 cent taco day is always worth a trip if you like cheap, tasty food. It seems like they have 99 cent tacos at least once a month. The rice and beans that come with the dinners are very good. My husband loves the salsa verde, and I usually stick with the mild because I am a wimp. Oh, and I must mention the Mexican Coca-Cola, which is made with cane sugar and is completely awesome.  The people who work here are always nice, and the place is extremely clean.  The only disappointment is the chips. I bought them once, and wouldn't do it again--they were kind of stale. Unlike other Mexican joints in town, you're not going to Taco Loco for the chips, so this does not affect my opinion of the place one bit."}
{"text":"First time here, after being told repeatedly by a friend to try it out.  The tacos are, understandably, damn good.  Also tried the chicken fajitas and nachos supremo. Huge quantities of food at good prices.   Assorted Mexican TV shows playing on the TVs made for easy entertainment.  It may be in a strip mall setting and super casual but the food is great."}
{"text":"never eat here if you are from chicago.  you will cry into your terrible al pastor taco."}
{"text":"I am on the fence here. Three stars or four. I think I'll give it four stars and retract it if I go again and have a similar experience. My wife got a chalupa. I got two tacos, one chicken, one chorizo. We also got a small order of loaded nacho. My tacos were great. They tasted pretty authentic and fresh. The tortilla shells were great (This is where I want to rate it four stars) .Then there were the nachos which were too loaded. We could've split the nachos and it would've been plenty of dinner. But they were pretty run of the mill nachos (this is where I want to rate it three stars).  We will be trying it again. It was lots of food for a really low cost."}
{"text":"it's such a shame this place shut down.  I always always always enjoyed their tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Pittsburgh I have longed for good mexican food, nearly impossible to find in this city.  So when I heard about Taco Loco I got all excited. A hidden taqueria/mexican restaurant on a small side street in the Southside. I thought...this must be it!  Sadly no. Similar to La Fiesta (another pittsburgh mexican place) the ingredients are cheap and not very fresh at Taco Loco. And you definitely question the hygeine. All in all, I was not impressed.  On my visit, there was the most bizarre disgruntled thirteen year old boy working there. This made the visit more amusing but  incredibly creepy when combined with the fact that we were the only people in the place.  Suffice to say I won't be going back to Taco Loco.  UPDATE: I was forced to go back to Taco Loco. I still feel pretty much the same about the food. 3/5 members of my party became ill afterwards.    But I want to mention, THE COURTYARD! they have a really nice patio/courtyard open in the summer! Very nice ambience out there. Just be careful with the food."}
{"text":"Taco Loco is a great little Taqueria, with a spicy flair!  Their tacos are amazing, chock full of cilantro, onions, diced tomatoes and lettuce, and if you go on Tuesdays or Thursdays chicken and beef tacos are only 99 cents each.  Taco Loco truly shines, however, if you go deeper into the menu. The burritos and chimichangas are some of the best in town, especially if you order them with the more traditional chorizo or al pastor meat options.  Be prepared to pay a little more if you want rice and beans on the side of some dishes; but then again, this is a Taqueria, not a sit-down place! And be sure to grab some hot-sauce from the little fridge next to the counter where you pick up your order. Most of the food will already be spicy enough for most people, but if you like your food so-hot-it-makes-you-cry, grab the red sauce in the transparent containers!  Bottom Line: for what it is--a little Taqueria where you order your food at one end of a counter and pick it up on the other--Taco Loco is a superb specimen. The food is spicy, full of fresh cilantro, and prepared FAST right there in front of you."}
{"text":"Good and cheap food. It's what I was looking for. On Friday and Saturday, it's a $1 for a taco. They were out of the ribeye, so lost a star there. The lengua was very good! They cut off the tastebuds off the tongue, very tender, too. I also got guacamole. It was a little plain, needed salt, lime juice, garlic, and onion. Oh yea, and pepper. Still, can't complain, it's all dirt cheap!"}
{"text":"If you're up in the Meijers/Walmart area and don't want to eat at the chain restaurants, then head on over to Taco Loco (in the Menard/Slumberland area).   This place is the real deal.  They have such a huge selection of Mexican fare that you can't go wrong.   I usually order three tacos and listen to the other reviewers.... order the Beef Tongue!!  It is so tender that you don't even know that it's tongue.  I used to hate tongue (and still hate liver) but after eating this, I'll still hate it, but I'll only eat it here.   They prep the tacos with cilantro and onion and they come out fast and hot!  You can get whatever kind of salsa you like -- I usually opt for the verde.   They also have the Mexican sodas -- like Juaritas and MEXICAN COKE/PEPSI/FANTA (ie made with SUGAR and not corn syrup).   So don't get the stuff out of the soda fountain and ask for the bottled stuff in the fridge behind the counter.     They have daily specials (like .99 tacos on Tuesdays), typical combos, menudo, corn, and whatever else you can think of.   It's a really good lunch spot up in the north Prospect area!  And the prices are very reasonable too -- less than $10 for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Had the enchiladas verdes which were surprisingly edible, although what's the deal with the sad looking shredded iceberg lettuce in this city? I've been sorely disappointed with Mexican food in general in Pittsburgh, and while this wasn't up to the standard I was used to in California, it was \"decent.\" The salsa was sufficiently spicy and I'd even venture to say it was \"good.\" Drinks are also served here, but they come on a separate receipt... Service was also decent; I'd go back here again & give it a second try."}
{"text":"I was not blown away by this restaurant, but maybe I just went on a bad day. It's not the most picturesque place in the world but I don't care about atmosphere that much when I want some fast Mexican food for lunch. I did have to laugh that there's a wall border that runs around the restaurant with various kinds of hot sauce... yet no hot sauce on the tables!  And you'll want hot sauce as the food itself is a bit bland. My tortilla was a bit brittle and the meat seemed under seasoned. I might check it out again some day based on the positive reviews here but sadly my first experience was not very good."}
{"text":"Ah Taco Loco, how the mighty have fallen. This restaurant has bounced around from location to location more over the past few years than, well, a mexican jumping bean(?). As of Jan 08, they moved to a much more conspicuous place on East Carson St. They somehow became co-joined so to speak with some dumpy little bar called the Mill Tavern. I suspect it was so they could split the cost of a liquor license.  So for those of you keeping score at home, there are 2 strikes:  1. They are no longer BYOB. 2. The best thing about their previous location on Jane St was the huge, awesome outdoor courtyard. Now that they're on Carson, that's gone.  And unfortunately this loser of a restaurant struck out looking. The 3rd and final strike:  3. The food blows. I think the other reviewers are right, cheap, not-so-fresh ingredients = bad food.  Do yourself a favor, if you want truly awesome, authentic Mexican, head downtown to Mexico City on Smithfield St (and a new location on Wood St). They know what's up when it comes to good food."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the two times I ate here! Conveniently this spot is located close to where I stayed and where I was attending for a test prep course in the area.... The first time I went here, I ordered the chicken chimichanga!  YUMMY! The second time I ordered the Friday 99 cent each cheese enchilada and carne asada taco!  You can always tell if the place is authentic Mexican (Spanish by that matter!) if the establishment uses WHITE cheese in their dishes!  Also, the corn soft tortilla for the taco made me missed the Mexican food in L.A. iAte all last year! The only gripe is that the \"HOT\" sauce was not spicy at all!  I mean, at first it was, but that taste went away after like 2 bites!  Perhaps they should put more peppers next batch! ;) Above all, this place was definitely NOT Taco Bell (:gagging:).   I was surprised to find an authentic Mexican spot in Champaign! Rock on Taco Loco!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was an off day or what but I ordered a Carne Asada plate from here for dinner during the week and it the meat was tough and chewy.  It was not seasoned well and had no flavor.  The guacamole was getting brown, what can I say it was horrible.  I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"I tried Taco Loco one Saturday afternoon a few months ago when I had one of my very rare, but very strong Mexican cravings (which really has more to do with having an early afternoon margarita then it does the cuisine).   The first offputting feature of this restaurant was the fact that I had to request, and then was subsequently charged, for what ended up being the most unimpressive set of chips and salsa I've ever had.  Since I wasn't impressed with the salsa, I ordered the guacamole hoping it would be better.  But to my great surprise,  I discovered what is likely the only guacamole on earth that does not make me want to grab a spatula and clean the bowl.  It is very difficult to spoil guacamole for me, but they did it with the garlicky-smokey-not quite sure if it's supposed to taste that way or not-flavor.  I was very sad about my chips and salsa/guacamole experience since that's usually my favorite part of \"Mexican dining\".  Well, that and the margaritas.    The tacos were equally questionable as the guac. I believe I ordered the carnitas tacos and something about them was just....off.  Another reviewer mentioned old, wilted lettuce and I experienced the same thing, which just makes you wonder about the rest of the ingredients.  My husband ordered fish tacos and wasn't impressed either.  After tasting my carnitas tacos, I was really glad I hadn't ordered fish tacos.  That just seems like something that doesn't come out right too often, and here it could have been scary.     As for the margarita, nothing sticks out in my mind other than the fact that I only ordered one, which probably means it was just, eh.  :-)    We won't be back here.  There is now a much tastier, albeit \"chainier\", Mexican restaurant serving up scrumptious salsa, tasty tacos and mouthwatering margaritas right across the street."}
{"text":"Disagree with post from 12/23  This place is the closest to authentic you can find. The mole sauce is excellent and the patio in the warm weather is a great place to chill on a nice night. BYOB or go across the street pick up a sixer or two.  They will keep your beer cold for you, bring some wine and they will also mix up some sangria for ya!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food in town. It is completely worth the trip out to North Prospect to visit this taqueria. Amazing tacos, burritos, salsas, tamales, etc.   They make four different kinds of salsa and they are all wonderful. My favorite is the green salsa.   They have a fajita special on Friday that is great. Fajita Fridays...Chicken or steak...2 orders for $15 . They are really wonderful fajitas.  This isn't a fancy place, but it is clean, the staff is friendly and the food amazing."}
{"text":"I went here every weekend for most of the summer. We are always looking for deals and for a while (sadly no longer) they had 99 cent tacos and tamales, and I was in pregnant lady heaven. I do think 1.90 a taco is a little pricey, it's not outrageous, and we are willing to pay. Cilantro, lettuce, tomato, lime, perfect. Their enchiladas are simple and delicious. We also have enjoyed their fajitas and the beans and rice were very tasty. I did not enjoy my steak burrito, personally, it lacked veggies and was basically beans and steak. Very heavy, pretty boring. I love that they have a variety of hot sauces and they are all very fresh tasting. I am very thankful for this restaurant, it is hard to find good Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"If you're in the Southside Works area and you're craving Mexican, you're better off heading to Qdoba. Taco Loco was very disappointing -- subpar margaritas (definitely not worth $7), less than fresh ingredients, and inflated prices.  We received our food quickly, but that's because my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant. Also, in addition to the tacky decor, there was a gigantic TV blaring what I assume was a Spanish version of Beavis and Butthead. To call the atmosphere \"unique\" would be generous."}
{"text":"My estimation falls between the 12/23 and 4/25 posts.  The food did taste of cheap ingredients, but it was good.  The presentation was nice as well.  The service was decent.  I found especially amusing how our patently non-hispanic waiter ostentatiously dropped Spanish here and there.  \"Seor, what would you like?\"  \"Can I get more water? / Si.\"  I heard the place was BYOB so we did, but we were surprised to learn that they charge $5 per guest who drinks.  We only had a beer each.  Most places charge a small corkage so you pay for what you drink.  This place it's a flat fee so if you want to get your $5 worth, bring enough to get totally ripped."}
{"text":"The food is authentic.  The atmosphere sucks.    It's brightly lit and in a strip mall across the road from Menards.  Tacos like they are meant to be made, fully loaded come on maize tortillas, damp and soft, with cilantro, cebollo (onions), tomatoes and lettuce, and of course, your choice of meat.  Thankfully no cheese, no sauce and no sour cream are added.  I suppose they would add it if you insisted, just as Biaggi's would add sauerkraut to your lasagna if you asked nicely.  Tacos are $1.99 each, or a platter of 3 for $7.50 with rice and beans.  Blaring Mexican music on the satellite TV for authenticity."}
{"text":"My first impression of Taco Loco was, admittedly, not great.  A bluesy sign on North Prospect advertising 99 cent tacos at a place with a silly name.  I imagined a place with all the quality of Taco Bell with all the atmosphere of Taco John's.  But don't be fooled, this is a real taqueria.  Tacos are served on soft corn tortillas with onion, cilantro, lettuce and tomato with your choice of meats.  The al pastor was spiced wonderfully, the lengua perfectly tender.  The ribeye steak was a nice cut, but frankly a little underseasoned.  To wash it down, glass bottles of Mexican Coke (mmm... cane sugar) or, of course, Jarritos.  Best of all - if you dread a trip north on Prospect, the menu says they'll be offering delivery soon."}
{"text":"Great prices, homemade food.  I am happy with my experiences at Taco Loco"}
{"text":"Food is really good. Beef tacos were delicious but the steak on the nachos was chewy and unappetizing. I'd definitely go with beef the second time around."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I shared a steak fajitas nacho platter, and it made a nice midday meal.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night. The adjacent bar was closed at 9pm, so we were offered soda. That was disappointing because I do enjoy a margarita when I go out for a dinner of Mexican food. This is especially odd because of their location on Carson St.   Overall, I have to say my experience at Taco Loco was just okay. I liked the salsas that came with the tortilla chips, but the chips themselves were a bit stale. The green sauce and chocolate mole were tasty but nothing to write home about. I'll go back for a lunch of tacos. Dinner was too quiet and the entrees seemed overpriced. Their saving grace is the sheer quantity of food that is served on a plate. If you go for dinner, go hungry."}
{"text":"The food is just good, bottom line. Perfectly prepared, good flavor, fresh ingredients. I love their summer corn on the cob with cheese, sour cream and spices.  Not the right place to dine for a good \"atmosphere\", but I'm not letting that affect my rating!"}
{"text":"We have some amazing Mexican food here in the CU.  I would never thought I'd say that when I moved here 7 years ago, but the restaurants continue to pop up and each one is better than the last.  This place does not have waiter service, you just order up front and pick up your food five minutes later from the window.  I think this makes it a great lunch spot.  Additionally it has some great lunch specials, all under $7.00. The place was very clean and well kept.    We had tacos- chicken and chorizo and chips and salsa.  The tacos tasted authentic.  They have an assortment of sauces in the cooler where you pick up your food. The spicy red sauce really gave them great flavor.  I think next time I will try the green one. If you're going for tacos, get the Mexicana style with the onions and cilantro on corn tortillas and you can't go wrong.  The salsa was fresh and tasty. Although the chips were not homemade, they were hot and tasty.   I love all the local places like this popping up in the area and I think ti is really important to support them.    Sum it up: seriously good Mexican food! Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"My first choice for burritos in the North Prospect area.  The beef tongue is soft and delicious.  Rice and beans are average.  No atmosphere, but the place is clean.  Counter service is fast, a few kind words and the abrupt - all business order taker smiles and becomes friendly."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, at all past/present locations, and i've always had good experiences.  My family has even chosen this place for special occasions over all the other restaurants in southside (and yes, we've tried 80% of them).  I usually go for the enchiladas verdes, but have tried a good portion of the menu.  and i love the homemade salsas.  I will admit the new location isn't as fun, and the merging with the divebar is a little offputting; however, i believe food quality is the most important part, and in my opinion, it's delicious.  I find it odd that Taco Loco's yelp ratings are so low considering how much i really do enjoy it."}
{"text":"Looks like fast food but better tasting than any of c-u sit-down spots like dos reales or el toro. Seems like it should be cheaper but still worth the money."}
{"text":"Taco Loco is conveniently located near Prospect Ave where all of the general stores.  Since its near all of this fancy schmancy stores, I figured it would be a sophisticated place. It's not. its your typical mexican restaurant. Simple chairs, bright decor with candy machines on the side. They even have a CD collection for you to buy. I had high expectations of the environment, but honestly, none of this really bothered me. I love simple warm restaurants with good food! Speaking of good food,  Small steak taco salad-- nothing fancy with the basic toppings. The meat (unlike most meats in taco places) had FLAVOR. Si, mucho flavor, though a wee bit tough. The topping like the gucamole were also very flavorful. My biggest praise is that the taco shell itself had flavor. Its sweet and tangy but absolutely not empowering. Most places do not have a good taco shell. Would I take this over a Qdoba veggie taco salad? Im not sure, but this taco salad ranks highly with me.  Tamales-- They're not the most flavorful tamales, but they sure pack in a lot of meat (thats not all dry and gross), which is GREAT.   Customer service- Overall people there were nice and the service was fast! My total for the meal was around 7 dollars. Not bad at all.  Overall, for a cheap mexcian meal, tthis is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I was not that impressed.  Went here for dinner a few months ago; the place was dead but was very loud due to the TV.  Service was good however, and the waiter was friendly when he wasn't sitting around watching TV.    The food was fine, but as other posters have said tasted like cheap ingredients.  It's along the lines of \"authentic\" cheap Mexican food, however, and it wasn't all that cheap.  I've worked in various places in Mexico for over 6 months, and the food here costs $3 or less in Mexico.    They do supposedly have tacos al pastor, but I have not yet tried them; I am assuming they're nothing at all like Mexico pastor, but I'm willing to go back and try it out."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday and the place was pretty empty which is usually not a good sign.  We sat at the bar and the service was friendly and prompt.  The space itself is really odd, because it's located now in the old mill site tavern with old black and white pics of steel workers next to tacky mexican decorations.  I ordered three tacos, the chicken taco was pretty good but not memorable.  All three were served on really good authentic corn tortillas.  The chorizo was really good served with a little lemon.  My favorite by far was the seasoned pork served with plenty of cilantro and a few chunks of pineapple.  These tacos are authentic, which means pretty small all three would equal about 1/2 of a mad mex burrito.  My friend had the chicken burrito, which he said was very good.  Their salsa with  the chips was spicy and crisp.  This is a decent lunch spot, probably wouldn't spend my evenings here however.  Overall, a good 2nd choice to El campesino for real mexican food.  I'd give it four stars, but I believe it's a bit overpriced especially the drinks.  They charge $2.50 for a bottled water??"}
{"text":"This place almost got 4 stars from me but the only thing that I couldn't get past was the environment. Don't get me wrong though, I'm all for laid-back and casual, but I kind of felt like I was eating in a tiny cafeteria or something. The only thing I will say that was cool was that my boyfriend and I  were probably the only non-hispanic people in there, which tells me this place is the real deal. It was also awesome that soccer games were on each tv. It just FELT authentic.  Then we got our food... pretty solid, not to mention SUPER cheap. And there were a few different and equally delicious salas available.  Overall, fast, cheap, authentic, but something between the atmosphere and the other elements just left me desiring more."}
