{"text":"Just had lunch there. Teriyaki Chicken with Spicy sauce, oh yea. A lil $$, but everything is going up now-a-days except my paycheck..."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken bowl is good. I like Kyoto Bowl's better but that's just personal preference on the taste of the sauce."}
{"text":"I have always tried to eat a little healthier and this is a great option! I have been here with colleagues and it's very close to my house! Everyone is very nice to talk to and the food is great! They have as much terkyaki as you can use ! I love it!"}
{"text":"Good place to go when you want inexpensive Japanese/ Asian Fusion food.  The sushi is not good, but the other entrees are okay.  My favorite is the Arizona bowl."}
{"text":"Good sushi, in a clean environment, with polite staff, and relatively short wait times.  This is, essentially, the way of Yogi's Grill.  I have to admit that I was apprehensive about the venture of \"fast food sushi\", but to my surprise, I found myself loving the place.  The fish is fresh, the rice is cooked perfectly, foods are not overly-saturated in sauces, the environment is just friendly enough for kids, and everything is made to order.  I actually prefer this place to a ton of actual sushi \"restaurants\".  Why only a \"4-star\" then?  The prices, which are its sole downfall, are too high.  Although this a \"fast food\" establishment, it does not stop them from charging a relatively high price for the fish and food.  All in all, I would still go back without a second thought.  Good sushi is a hard thing to find."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Yogi's Grill.  I have them on speed dial on my phone!  My favorite is the salmon teriyaki plate, but I like every thing else on the menu too!   The food is always very fresh and well prepared.  The staff are friendly and they even remember my name.  I highly recommend Yogi's Teriyaki and Grill."}
{"text":"Second time being here. Great teriyaki bowls. Perfect for after gym protein meal. The spicy  teriyaki is bomb.com."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fresh and quick meal, Yogis Grill is a good place to come. They have teriyaki food and sushi. Price is fairly inexpensive. Good place to come when you are looking for fresh fast food."}
{"text":"My first and last time here.  I got the beef and tempura meal, it comes with 2 pieces of a California roll, a \"salad\" which is really just some cut up lettuce, no dressing, 2 pieces vegetable tempura and 1 piece of shrimp tempura. My shrimp tasted like cleaning product, and my beef was dry, even with the teriyaki sauce. The drink was separate which took my total from $10 to $13, with tax. Definitely a wasted $13."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years.  Chicken and rice bowl.  Had been a month or two since last visit, today I went and ordered a chicken bowl to go.  Got back to my office and added their teryiaki sauce, thought it looked kind of red.  Took a few bites and it was not teryaki sauce at all, some kind of red spicy sauce.  That was all I had in my bag.  I dont know why they went away from their teryaki sauce, really it was teryaki chicken I ordered.  Not chicken with some random hot sauce  on it.  Needless to say, the meal is ruined and I will not be going back there until they change back to teryaki sauce."}
{"text":"so i use to go to Yogis a lot about 3 years back and the quality of the food as well as the service has gone down...sadly I also noticed the portions went down as prices went up! I hate that the lunch combo price went HIGH as well  Still good but just not the same"}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered the Arizona Bowl (crab meat on brown rice with avocado) here, but it is delicious!  The service is average, not bad not outstanding, but the food is always consistent.  It's usually busy during the lunch hour, but I've still always been able to find a seat."}
{"text":"Server was very helpful. They are always very pleasant. Plus the wife loves their Arizona bowl!"}
{"text":"The chicken and veggie place is great for a healthy lunch.  Plenty of broc and cabbage.  The spicy teriyaki sauce is good as well.  Wish it was a little cheaper for lunchtime - but there aren't many fast places where you can get veggies.  The plate and drink will cost you $8."}
{"text":"First time here, and it was yummy! Not to add that you could get a SPICY teriyaki sauce that is just the perfect amount of spice! I look forward to actually trying many other items on the menu, which is the only reason I gave them 4 stars. Will be back soon with my home squad an see if they seem as satisfied as me!!!!"}
{"text":"Store front location. Doesn't look like much. But...don't judge the outside. Nice menu. Sushi rolls and cooked meals like teriyaki and tempura.  I was in on a Wed nite and very nice gal took care of me. I was so undecided. She didn't rush me. Place order, pay and within 10 minutes a nice presentation of teriyaki and sushi appears. The teriyaki sauce is nice consistency. They even have spicy teriyaki. Orders small bowl. Nice portion. Nicely grilled. Good flavor served over white rice.  The sushi roll with Tuna and crab was really good.  I'll come back again."}
{"text":"I loves me some Yogis. Great lunch time spot. Packed most of the time but not too bad with time it takes to get your order made. I always call ahead so its ready when I get there."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance after a mediocre experience the first time!  I got the chicken bowl same as last time. This was a much better experience,it was really good. The temperature of the food may have played a factor the first time. The people here are so nice,some of the nicest that I've actually ever met in Phoenix! This is a very clean restaurant and well maintained. I will continue to eat here now they have passed all my detailed tests!"}
{"text":"The food here might be good, I don't know, we weren't allowed to stay. I showed up, with my family of 5, at 8:30. We walked to the counter where the girl informed us they were only serving orders to go. I said, \"the sign says you're open 'till 9.\" She said that yes, they were, but once our food came out it would only leave us about 5 minutes to eat.  So wait, let me get this straight; First, it takes 25 mins to make a few teriyaki bowls? Second, as far as I know, if we enter an establishment during hours of operation, we should be able to sit down and eat. Third, you want me to take my family of 5, including a 3 year old and a baby, outside to eat in the car so you can close your doors at 9 on the dot?  Give me a break."}
{"text":"Yogi's.....you get a solid C Not great, got bad. You are just ok.  I got the #26. 2 pieces of sushi (that were warm) 1/2 steak 1/2 chicken and some tempura......1 shrimp 1 onion ring and get this........one tempura carrot? WTF? I'd come back if I had some type of coupon.  This must me a good source of protein for body builders, there were a few in here getting in their GAINS."}
{"text":"Kay so they definitely have: great selection good prices good size dishes, even the garden salad was a great size sushi rolls very courteous open late   I do not think I would get the chicken teriyaki though not the greatest ever but overall a good consistent asian fast food place."}
{"text":"So gross. Baby flies all over us and our food. This location was so dirty. The employees were in the back just sitting around instead of cleaning."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I wish I'd gone somewhere else. The sushi was not very good (I believe whatever I had made me sick) and the bowls are mediocre at best. I'd suggest going to Chipotle next door unless you're craving overpriced \"meh\" Japanese food."}
{"text":"Someone we worked with suggested this as \"japanese/sushi\" when we went to lunch since we were at Mesa CC for the weekend. Not quite. It's more like a quick stop, japanese version of panda express. Although the food was cheap and surprisingly not bad (we got teriyaki bento boxes, shrimp tempura, california roll, dragon roll and crunch roll), I prob wouldn't suggest this to anyone looking for real japanese food. Ironically, there were two other authentic places a block from where we were before heading out to lunch."}
{"text":"My sister and I go her every month or so. She says she likes sushi, but she's not very adventurous. So she gets the shrimp crunch roll, we split an order of shrimp & veggie tempura (onions, squash, carrots, avocado, zucchini) and I get either a California roll or a chicken Teriyaki bowl.   Food is really tasty and hot when it's supposed to be. The workers are nice and bring the food right to your table. Quick, everything tastes fresh. Not a ton of sushi variety and I wish there were more descriptions (I'd probably order other rolls if I knew what they were/what was in them), but over all I enjoy this place a lot."}
{"text":"It's pretty decent. It's clean, and the staff is on the ball. If you have ever been to a food court japanese place, the food is pretty comparable to that. That should be your expectation walking into this place. Typically this place is poppin during Lunch Time with the people coming from the Bank of America building next door."}
{"text":"Very good food, for the price.  Only real complaint is that there is one gentleman that runs the cash register at times who seems to get a bit turned around when bringing you your food. He'll bring it to another table the first few times.  Other than that, this is a really nice place. Try the Crunch Roll!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff no smiles but they were quick and efficient. The sushi tasted really good and had no issues with the packaging especially because it was a to go order.   If I would have been greeted with a smile and provided with better customer service they would have had a 5."}
{"text":"The food here is great, wish i would've been able to eat some tonight! Since when did the closing time become the time the employees expect to be able to go home? If you're going to stop taking orders at 8:45, then your sign should say that you close at 8:45!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food great place and clean.I had a great time with my family and friends Imy favorite is the tempura dish"}
{"text":"Yogis has been a go to spot for many of my friends. There bowl are really good wether you get beef or chicken and there California rolls are bomb! If you are ever this way I would recommend stopping by and trying them out"}
{"text":"Meh, it is fine - the food is inexpensive and quick. I'd go there again, but am not too terribly impressed with either the food or the service."}
{"text":"Today, my parents and I had lunch at Yogi Grill. We shared a #26: Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Combo. It came with 2 pieces of California Roll, Small Salad with Citrus Dressing, and 3 pieces of tempura (shrimp, onion, and sweet potato). The Chicken Teriyaki was tender dark chicken with green scallion in gourmet sauce over white rice. It was yummy!"}
{"text":"Went in to get food 20 min before they closed and they said they are only doing to go orders and no sushi.  This is why I normally stick to mom and pop restaurants. They would never turn away business 20 min before close"}
{"text":"Usually get the chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies, has never disappointed. The sushi is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Holy balls. This place is amazing. I am in town from Texas and wanted a good meal while I was being lazy watching tv at the hotel. I looked at the reviews and figured I would try it out out. What I got was THE BEST teriyaki chicken ever. The rice was cooked to perfection and the chick was decadent. Not to mention the restaurant was  very clean. Might have it again tomorrow for lunch"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years since they opened back in 06 because the food tastes great.  Beats the pants off of Panda Express or Kyoto Bowl because the food is made fresh when you order.  Super psyched that the brand has expanded to a few other locations in the Tempe and Mesa area, hope they open shop in Chandler next!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a place to eat on my lunch break. I got the vegetable bowl (regular size) with rice it was only 2.99. So, I added the egg rolls. Very yummy. Will have it again!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place so be took me for  lunch .this is the dirtiest place I've ever  eaten at .employee at register was sick coughing sneezing and then the unthinkable he turns around never washes his hands. After covering his mouth several  Times with his hand and handling money. He starts preparing my food .I walked out did not care about a refund"}
{"text":"Yogi's is a nice fast-food alternative to a traditional Japanese restaurant. Prices are about the same as you'd find in most sit-down Japanese places, but there's something to be said about getting in and out quickly.  The food is good. I've had a variety of their sushi (all rolls, all cooked, except for the very occasional raw tuna options). All were restaurant quality -- quite good. My favorite is their caterpillar roll, with an eel sauce which isn't too sweet (about $9).  I give their salad mixed reviews. The dressing is light and tastes great; it's a standard Japanese vinaigrette with a hint of sesame. But why do Japanese restaurants always use iceberg lettuce? It just doesn't appeal to me.  The interior of the restaurant is very clean and open, and the bathrooms get an A. I'm very disappointed that they've switched from plastic serving dishes to styrofoam. I don't go here much for this reason; I just don't like eating off of styrofoam, and it feels very wierd in such a nice atmosphere.  Parking here can be hard; park north of Buffalo Wild Wings if the main lot is full."}
{"text":"Kevin was a great server!!!! Helped me choose what I should get. when I asked him I wanted to try something new he recommended the chicken katsu and I loved it!!! Only down side was one of the employees that goes by \"chino\" was staring and being very awkward, made me feel a bit uncomfortable but the place is awesome definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Yes I am a Fan!  I have not tried everything but there Chicken Teriyaki Bowls are Great!! The green Salad is fresh!! The Tempura Veggies are simply delish!!!. The service is fast. You can call, to have ready for pick up! If you have not tried this place, You wont know what you are missing!! Hidden Treasure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially for lunch!! Specials are awesome but some of the sushi is a bit pricey for a quick spot, but its very good! Healthier choices and good service, food is always good. If youre in a rush, i suggest calling in your order bc it usually takes at least 5 mins to get your fresh made food and they are ALWAYS busy at lunch"}
{"text":"I don't like this place  there sushi  is all premade that's y it come's out in a to go box. They keep  in the fridge in the back, and for the price you pay it should all be made fresh."}
{"text":"One of my staple dishes is the spicy tuna roll, and I love a place that can make it spicy, and tasty.  Yogi's is such a place.  I love what they do.  If I worked closer to the Fiesta Mall area, I'd be frequenting this place more often.  That's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"Yummm love their chicken teriyaki bowls! Delicious, you can change it to brown rice, and the chicken is always cooked amazingly. Their teriyaki sauce rocks - you can even buy it in bottle for yourself! Everyone here is always so friendly and the food is fast, which is important for me when it's rushed lunch break.  Only taking away one star because I've stolen bites of other items before and was slightly underwhelmed. Their katsu was thin and dry, and their egg rolls were meh. Gyoza was decent but nothing to really rave about. Haven't tried any of the seafood fare they've been rolling out...maybe I'll get to that someday.  All in all, love me some Yogi's. I'd never turn down a teriyaki bowl!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I usually go here to get a quick terriyaki and sushi fix.  I prefer their Arizona bowl as it is under $6 and is very filling.  One of my favorite sushi items is their philly roll.  I also like their rainbow roll.  Everything is made fresh.  The staff there is very nice and pretty fast at getting our food to us.  A few years ago I took a group of friends and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Got the chicken veggie bowl. It's more of a chicken and lettuce bowl. 1/2 cup of broccoli and half a cucumber slice.  The chicken was good and the rice sticky, they got that right.  I would suggest more veggies (like the advertisement) and less lettuce filler."}
{"text":"I like Yogi's. The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty good. The tempura doesn't really have any flavor to it so I'd skip that completely but the rolls are good. They have lunch specials including a teriyaki combo that includes a drink but of course, I never order that because I'm a glutton. I've come here two or three times with my co-workers and it gets busy inside. We usually call ahead so our food is ready when we get there and then order whatever else we need to for our other co-workers so it's made while we eat and fresh when we leave. I love their teriyaki sauce, it's just the right amount of sweet and it's help yourself. All the ladies in my office seem to enjoy Yogi's so I know I'll be ordering from here soon and fairly often."}
{"text":"Good food. Tabletops are high but they do have some booths. Not the best seating layout but great staff and fast if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place has great food! Whether you want traditional teriyaki or sushi rolls, this is your place. Their garlic noodles are the best I have ever had. I typically get that with the teriyaki chicken. Their dishes are very fulfilling. Recommend to anyone nearby!!"}
