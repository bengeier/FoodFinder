{"text":"Blessings cafe has relocated to Jefferson street in downtown monroe..it is now called Blessings Deli. Open Monday thru Friday 11 am till 4 pm"}
{"text":"Well, I can't comment on the food since I never got it. I was there for 45 minute during a break from court and had to leave with no hope of getting served. Unfortunately and handful of jurors had to follow me out since we ran out of time. I didn't think a sandwich was too much to ask in 45 minutes. If you have any time constraints at all, don't bother."}
{"text":"A decent place to grab a sandwich in downtown Monroe. Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"This place might be OK during the week when there is considerable traffic in Downtown Monroe and they can justify more staff but avoid on Saturday.

Only one person serving as both Hostess and Server and they get overwhelmed very easily.  While I just ordered a Cheeseburger, it was so overcooked and dry, I had to load it up with Ketchup just to add enough moisture into the burger to render it edible. Unfortunately I use Ketchup very little because it my least favorite condiment.

I suspect that this place in better during the week when they have a full staff on hand but can not confirm. The only thing I can confirn is that this is not a good place to go for a brunch or lunch on Saturday."}
