{"text":"The place used to Popeyes and then was changed to Dave and now its Max, all selling fried chicken. I bought the strips combo and the chicken was cooked well. The strips were good size with very little breading compared to Popeyes where there is too much breading then the actual chicken. The breading does not hold on so its not crispy.

The spicy fries were pretty good and the biscuit was very close to Popeyes, soft  flakey!!!

The service was quite fast and friendly and the food came out quick. Parking isn't a problem as its in Heartland.

For my Muslim brothers and sister: the place service halal food and the sign stated hand slaughter. 

All in all service 4 star but the food is a 3 Star!"}
{"text":"I came for the Tuesday special which is $2.69 for a thigh and a drumstick.  I asked for spicy.  The chicken looks very similar to Popeyes (which used to be at this location).   The spicy chicken didn't have much of a heat kick but rather a masala spice taste.  Skin was crispy, meat was juicy and piping hot.  I just hope they serve me with a smile next time...the lady who originally served me seemed like I was bothering her when I ordered.  Although as I finished my meal I saw a different employee in uniform who was bright and bubbly assisting other Customers with choices.  I personally still prefer Popeye's spicy chicken and Mary Brown's spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting chicken. Not too salty. Just about right. Similar tasting to Popeye's chicken. Chicken was fresh, hot and juicy and not greasy like Mary Browns. Biscuits are good too. Can't speak to well of their sister store \"Dave's Chicken.\"  Mediocre tasting. Wish they had more seating though but it was great experience. Would go there again. One of the best chicken places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Chicken smelled like fish and was not crunchy at all. My mashed potatoes were not smooth and had large chunks of potato in it. Soft drink was small about the same size as a small coffee at Tim hortons. Service was slow and I was the only one in there. I'm never going back and do not recommend anyone to try their food."}
