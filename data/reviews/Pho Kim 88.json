{"text":"We eat here often, and simply put, the food is very good, prices reasonable, and everything is served quickly.   They have a nicely varied menu.  Just be warned that the place can be crowded at times, mainly because of the first sentence."}
{"text":"I've had good meals from Pho Kim 88 dining inside but I've had nothing but inconsistency for the take out.   Maybe its because my friends all order different things and we pass the plates around so the dishes that are so so are quickly forgotten.   They have the well known Vietnamese dishes--pho and rice noodles as well as Sushi.  The food is decent overall but for me it's like playing a slot machine -- whether its going to be ok vs. great when ordering out."}
{"text":"Huge portions, more $$ than most asian restaurants, facility looked ok but had funky 1970s swivel chairs that were not comfy and tables were tightly packed.  Service was adequate.  
Food was actually really good, but the negatives overshadowed it for me. 
Maybe for future take out only"}
{"text":"The Deal: Pretty okay pho, (given the availability of pho in the area); good portion, but a bit pricey; still would come back

Order: Pho Bac (tripe, sliced beef, beef balls) - $9.95 & tea
*Note - I'm a bit biased as from CA/bayarea so must admit had better for lower price. 
But given the area & cold  weather pho hit the spot. Portions were pretty large, soup just seemed lacked flavor..like a bit watered down or something.
The first plate of bean sprouts/basil not enuf so ask for more; basil pretty fresh, sprouts a bit brown lookin'; Tea good & free

Other Comments:
* large menu w/ Vietnamese items inc. rice dishes, ban xeo (~$7), bun bo hue ($9.95) also japanese bentolike box combos  (~15)
*bf had the sushi which looked like good portions and said pretty good"}
{"text":"Great sushi and dinners.  We go there or get take out at least once per month.

Their SUSHI is fresh.  We love it.  They just created new rolls on the menu...each time we go back,  I try a new one.  We have never been disappointed with their sushi. 

CHICKEN FRIED RICE and the Chicken PAD THAI are amazing!  Our favorite dinner is the HIBACHI steak dinner. Prices are reasonable and they have generous portions on these meals.  The lunch version is just as good, just smaller portions and no soup or shrimp appetizer. The Seafood Diablo is also extremely good...spicey too. I also like their wonton soup. Their ginger dressing for their salad is light and tasty. 

If you like fresh spring rolls in peanut dipping sauce, theirs are delicious. They also have a vietnamese rice noodle dish with peanut, basil - also excellent.

They recently remodeled and created new additional seating.  It is very nice.  The staff are very friendly.  The restrooms are clean and nice.  The owner is usually around too and very pleasant man.

Tip:  order vietnamese items on menu OR items above. 

Tip: beware Chinese items (general tso) - it's done differently than traditional Chinese restaurants.

Tip: lunch has large portions too and cheaper menu

If you are in the neighborhood, give them a try."}
{"text":"The best spring rolls in Pittsburgh! Their beef pho is amazing and the servers are always pleasant. However on busy nights there is a longer wait time. For some reason they only have two waitresses even during the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Say 2.5 starts. Meh...just meh. Not very vegatarian friendly- which was surprising. Spring rolls with tofu were ok. Pho with veggies, tofu and chicken broth was just ok. Trams is still tops imho. Decent atmosphere here, decent service. Thought price was a little steep."}
{"text":"The clever name is what drew me in. For those that don't know. Pho is pronounced with an \"uh\" sound rather then and \"oh\" sound.. So the delightful, potentially accidental, play on word sounds makes me giggle every time. That aside, the food is delicious, servings generous and restaurant of a small, intimate size. They're good for any age and have ample selections outside of the regular pho you'd expect.

It was a busy night, as I understand most weekend nights are, but we didn't wait long. The only thing I'd change would, perhaps, be the attentiveness of our waitress. That could be chalked up to how busy the restaurant was. I'm honestly not sure. She seemed distracted, preoccupied and wasn't on hand frequently for drink refills.

Lastly, they have thai iced bubble tea. That one thing is enough for me to want to move in and live in the back."}
{"text":"Gross, soup tasted like a wet dog. Tiny portions. Outrageous prices. Avoid this dump."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty chicken pad thai! But beware: don't order the pork bun appetizer. They give you the entree version that costs four times as much and apologize that the appetizer is no longer available (even though it's on the menu and I pointed to the appetizer section when I said it)!"}
{"text":"Great spot for locals.  Not sure I'd travel too far to visit, but being right down the street, I go probably twice a month.  Nice people, good food, fast service."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese and Vietnamese restaurant. Lot's of seating, with a small sushi bar you can sit at as well.

Really great Vietnamese menu. Outstanding Pho, and good smothies as well.
The portions are big, the ingredients are fresh, and the price is on point.

The sushi is so so. I would eat it again, but wouldn't go there just for sushi.
There was nothing wrong with the fish, it was just sloppily prepared, and nothing special.

Totally worth the drive out to the suburbs all in all."}
{"text":"I'm sad to be one of those people who only writes a review when they have something bad to say. I used to love Pho Kim 88. I've dined in their quaint little restaurant a few times. They've got truly unique General Tso, excellent Pho and yummy spring rolls. You know what else they did? They delivered. In fact, they delivered to me many times, the last of which was in early December.

So imagine my surprise when I called to order delivery on Saturday and a man on the other line told me they haven't delivered \"in a year or two.\" I asked if it was a recent change and he flat out told me no. Even though if claims free delivery on their menu, which I had acquired during a delivery less than 6 weeks ago. 

So I was upset, but not devastated. I changed my order to pick-up and sent my husband through Rt 88 traffic to grab our meal. We were told 20 minutes and 45 minutes later our meal was ready. My hus an was tired of sitting there in his coat so he paid, grabbed the tied bag and left. Only to get home and realize they forgot my Pho. They provided the \"fixins,\" but no broth. 

We were really upset at this point. And starving. So I called and asked that they simply remove the Pho from our tab. She was so confused and seemed to not understand that he had already made it home with the incomplete meal. As of today, it has still not been reimbursed on our card. 

We're frustrated and will likely find a new Pho restaurant. So sad."}
{"text":"Fantastic Sushi. This is my wife's favorite place to eat. Everything I have tried there has been great. I have no complaints about this restaurant"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch at 2pm and got seated but not waited on. Tables that were seated after us were waited on. Seems to be a lack of help. We were looking forward to the meal. Good reviews have been written and we were looking forward to adding to them."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Delicious Pho and spring rolls. Wonderful service. Definitely will return"}
{"text":"The Pho is remarkable. The lemongrass adds a crisp taste. The dumplings and sushi is some of the best in the area."}
{"text":"Phee Phi Pho YUM!!!   We had some business to take care of close by and noticed Pho Kim 88 restaurant so, being Pho lovers, we thought, \"Lucky us! It's been awhile since we had a big bowl of Pho. Let's go eat!\"  We started with the fresh spring rolls, emphasis on fresh, served with a tasty peanut sauce. I ordered a customized Pho that included seasoned tofu and lots of vegetables. Our waitress wasn't bothered one bit by my specifications. In fact, she was really helpful. My husband ordered the traditional beef Pho and liked it even better than his favorite Pho restaurant which incidentally is located in Albuquerque. (Believe it or not there are quite a few Pho restaurants there.)  Bottom line:  We really liked this place and will most definitely return.  Food was fresh and delish, service was fast and friendly, decor was sweet. Hey, what's not to love about a big happy Buddha greeting you and bidding you farewell?"}
{"text":"Great pho, spring rolls, and bento boxes. Sushi is ok, but not bad for the price. Recommend mostly for the Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and reasonable priced. The staff was super accomodating, even though we arrived just a little bit before closing time. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I come here for the Great Banh Xeo/Saigon crepe!  Fresh herbs/vegetables/bean sprouts on the side.  Great fish sauce.  This dish is awesome!

My foodie friend from out of town also very much enjoyed the saigon crepe.

The calamari was good.  

The wonton soup had a real wonton in it!  And it was delicious!

The kids enjoyed the Broccoli chicken and the General Tso's chicken.  They are picky eaters but dug in.  

It is comforting, yummy, slightly exotic food at a reasonable price.  Happiness in the tummy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get away from anything, and everything St. Patrick's Day, and was in the mood for something Asian. I made the escape from the family, and found myself at Pho Kim, I just wasn't sure what I'd be ordering this time. 
I went for the squid salad as an appetizer, and ordered the Seafood Diablo after some suggestions, since I've had everything else in most of the columns on the menu. The squid salad came with sliced up squid, seaweed, lettuce, and cucumber strips. I was hoping for actual chunks of squid, with legs, and tentacles, but was happy with the taste of the salad. The squid was the only ingredient seasoned, and the rest of the salad a bit bland.

The Seafood Diablo came out on a huge platter, with a generous portion of steamed rice (enough for two). I was given a choice of veggie fried rice, or noodles as the side, but since chewy udon noodles came mixed in the dish, I chose steamed rice. The udon was perfectly cooked, chewy, and mixed nicely with the scallops, shrimp, and mixed vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and onions). I'm not sure the base of the sauce, but it was good, not as spicy as I'd like. The Seafood Diablo came with a small side salad with a miso(?) dressing, and a small side soup. All this food in front of me made me feel like I was in some kind of chow competition. Food, and dishes spanning my table, and the fresh spring rolls that I always order, had to go home in a to-go box."}
{"text":"Pho Kim is really good, but I can tell that they've changed their menu... Their Pad Thai used to be amazing but now it's okay.  I've heard the Pho is different too.. 

I used to love to get the Royce's Roll but now I'm liking just the plain vegetable roll :) The vegetable curry is really good and if you want a real treat get a Honeydew smoothie. Mmmmmm...

The staff is always friendly and helpful and they remember who you are, they really do love their customers. It's BYOB and clean. I'd definitely suggest it for someone who wants a quick bite to eat and was in the area."}
{"text":"First things first, we arrived about 30 minutes prior to close on the 4th of July and could have easily been told that they were closing up. Instead, we were welcomed and given excellent service. We started with The tomyum seafood soup, although not entirely traditional, it was out of this world. I ordered the green chicken curry - I almost ate my weight in it it was so good. Augie got the Pad Thai and it was by far in my top 3 Pad Thai experiences ever. I wish they had been serving sushi because I'm sure we would have been in for a treat! Stumbling upon this place was a lucky find for sure. If I had known they were BYOB I would have raided my grandma's liquor cabinet before I came."}
{"text":"Is it just me, or has the quality of certain meals gone down hill here?
I think their sushi is still good.  But the Pad Thai seems to have changed.  Its rather greasy now.  I also ordered the Fried Calamari Salad....disappointing not only in presentation, but also in taste.  It was GIANT tubes of calamari deep fried and thrown on a bed of lettuce.  The knife given to me was not sharp enough to cut them.  So I had to pick up the huge chunks and bite off pieces. The batter on the interior of the squid was uncooked....pretty gross.  I don't understand the concept of this?  why not cut it before frying it so that you can actually eat it with the salad?  Even my beloved Bun Bo Hue seems to have changed in the flavor profile.  I'm pretty upset about this.  I used to love coming here, but it seems as if they got a new cook or the old cook has a lost any inspiration they once had."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Pho Kim 88 since we had been missing Vietnamese food. I am Vietnamese so I can say that the pho is below average, particularly given the outrageous price for it. The pho broth didn't quite hit the cinnamon stick and star anise blend needed to be considered good. Also, I expected the usual basil and mint leaves to accompany the traditional noodle soup but was only given bean sprouts, a lime wedge, and pepper. The service was horrible as the waitress even indicated the amount for which we should be tipping. The sandwich was above average but not $10 worth. Vietnamese coffee was very sweet and watered down. I cannot justify coming back there. I'd rather drive the extra miles to go to an authentic Vietnamese joint that doesn't charge an arm and a leg for mediocre food."}
{"text":"In the past I've looked forward to even craved Pho Kim's fare.  Unfortunately, my recent visits have not delivered the consistent quality I've come to expect from this establishment.  I'm beginning to think this place is not what it once was."}
{"text":"I grew up eating very authentic Asian food.  
That being said, my husband and I really enjoy going to Pho Kim 88.  
Their Pho is good.  It's not the absolute BEST, but it's tasty and the portion size is well worth the money.  
I kind of feel like they went the way that most Asian restaurants do in that they tailor the flavor of the food they serve to appeal to the American palate.  The fish sauce they serve with the Pho is not very strong, and the soy sauce is your standard Kikkoman (this drives me crazy.  Kikkoman is probably the worst soy sauce on the market).
For a REAL treat try the Pad Thai.  
It's honestly the best Pad Thai I have ever had on the East coast, AND it's made with real pad noodles!

Ample parking, BYOB and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Got some of the best Sushi and Soup around;  Salads are pretty good too.   Don't go too nuts though"}
{"text":"Food was really good. I tried a Vietnamese broth dish, spring roll, sushi, and Chinese shrimp dish. Everything tasted very good and the presentation was very nice. The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that the decor is very dated. Carpet needs replaced as do the chairs at the tables. They also do takeout which I will try sometime."}
{"text":"Never disappoints... All their Pho is fantastic. Staff is always great! We always go Sunday's for lunch when the crowd is light... Especially on game days! It's BYOB too! For those that like Chinese & sushi Pho Kim has lots of good choices."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with family. This is a very solid place, where they use fresh ingredients, serve large, tasty portions, and have friendly service. It wasn't crowded at all, even on a weekend night. I had a lemongrass honey salad with lettuce, mung bean sprouts, peanuts, cucumbers, carrots, and shrimp. It was light and refreshing.

I also had a taro bubble smoothie and that was yummy, although the ice wasn't crushed as finely as would be ideal."}
{"text":"The Pho Thai gets an A++++

After many suggestions and after shopping around town for pho that tastes the way I want it to taste, I came here. I found it here. My only complaint (and honestly, this is with any pho) is that I just want more noodles. Everybody was long done eating and I was still chowing down on my pho, seemingly unable to part with it. I left full and happy doing the Sriracha-cha-cha. 

My friends all enjoyed their dinners immensely. My friend got the steak hibachi dinner special. The portions were gargantuan and she reports it was awesome. Not joking about the portions. She's having it for lunch today and I'm extremely jealous. Her daughter got the vegetable lo mein and my mom got the chicken lo mein. Again, the portions were out of control and both said it was delicious. My sister got spicy California roll and the bahn xeo and both looked delightful and were enjoyed. Her newborn baby just had milk which came from home, so I will not write a review about that.

We were all very comfortable and well taken care of the entire visit. This place is small. Intimate. I liked it. I will go here again as soon as the pho withdrawal sets in. Maybe even tomorrow."}
{"text":"I was craving Pho and looking for a closer location rather than driving to downtown and I found this place. When we walked into the restaurant I felt the place was not so clean compare to what I saw on Yelp photos. Me and my husband just each got the pho and the waitress gave us look because we did not order any appetizers. Long story short, Pho was pretty good. Although, we decided that we would rather drive in downtown to get our favorite Pho."}
{"text":"My rating is solely based on the pho I had here. If a restaurant has \"Pho\" in its name I expect it to have good pho. The pho was not very good. Only tried it once and won't be giving it a second shot. This place is much closer to where I live than any other pho place in pittsburgh but I choose to go to other restaurants. Service was friendly and they had a million other options on the menu which I didn't try."}
{"text":"This by far the best pho in Pittsburgh. They do serve sushi, bento, and other Asian inspired menu items. The kimchi is superb and everything is fresh. My daughter loves the lo mien and fried rice. The servings are a little big but that leaves plenty to take home and have again (the food is delicious the next day as well).
The inside is very nice and clean and the staff is friendly. If you can't eat in then they have the option for take out. The food is prepared quickly and cold and hot items are packaged separately (keeps the fresh items from wilting). They offer a drink while you wait which is also very nice. 
The location is a little difficult to get to at times because route 88 in castle Shannon is usually slowed with traffic and the parking lot is hard to get in and out of. 
With the exception of the traffic this place should not be missed!"}
{"text":"We eat at Pho Kim regularly and we really like their food. Their take on Pad Thai is different than most, far less sweet. More like a Pad See Ew you might get at another Thai restaurant. But we love it, actually prefer it to most other pad thai.

Their sushi is very good, but sometimes the pieces can be rather large. I'm a big guy and I don't feel like my mouth should be bursting with 1 piece or sushi. But like I said, the sushi is very good, good quality."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places around.  The employees are always so friendly and always ask how my day was when I pick up my food.  I love the Royce Roll.  They have just redecorated and the place looks great.  A decent place to go for a low key dinner."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 2 years. While my previous experiences were great today's meal left a lot to be desired. The Pho broth lacked depth and the rice noodles were heavy and starchy. The hibachi shrimp was mediocre, not fresh and didn't come with a fried dumpling as it stated on the menu. Their menu has changed. I wonder if the restaurant changed hands? It used to be packed but now on a Friday night at dinner time there were plenty of open tables. I was so disappointed in my food that I won't be back and I no longer recommend it."}
{"text":"We have been to this place many times and this is the first time we ordered takout. Well, we weren't let down. We ordered a bowl of pho, two spring rolls and this Vietnamese pancake/omelot thing (banh xeo). They told us it would be done in 10 minutes. We live 12 minutes away so we hurried as fast as we could.

The total was $24, not bad. The soup was packaged up into two bowls and a two bags full of goodies (basil, bean sprouts, jalepenos and limes). It was interesting to get it this way. The only difference is that I think you get less broth this way than you normally do. Their broth is really good, I usually always get a bowl of pho when I come here. This bowl was the whole cow....tripe, steak, meat balls and probably some other parts. You get a decent sized portion of the meat. Plus lots of noodles. Its a shame there wasn't more broth. The noodles were overcooked though. Perhaps this is the weakness in getting pho take out.

The spring rolls are my girlfriend's favorite. They're large and stuffed full of pork, shrimp, herbs and vermicelli into a rice paper sheet. They come with this dark sweet sauce with peanuts. I'm convinced its hoisin sauce mixed with fish sauce. I could be wrong. Its pretty tasty.

The pancake (banh xeo) thing was a large omelot stuffed with meat, bean sprouts and some other veggies. It was pretty good. I've ordered it before and it was more like an egg foo young than an omelot. This one was a large egg omelot wrapped around all the ingredients. I really like the egg foo young version more and this dish was a bit of a let down. My girlfriend liked alot more than I did.

Like I said, we've eaten there many times. They have a rather large and eclectic menu of Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese food. In addition to the pho and other Vietnamese dishes (which are great tasting and with nice presentation), they have a decent sized Japanese menu. They have a variety of teppanyaki dishes (hibachi to you yinzers), a great sushi menu, several Japanese apps and soups. My girlfriend realy likes their sushi. I've found it to be as good as any other in town and average priced. I come here for the Vietnamese food, though. Primarily their pho but I have gotten their noodle and salad dishes.

As far as service...we've never had any problems. The waitresses are nice and polite...even considering our mess-making 2 year old. The presentation of the food is always top notch. Whether its one of the Vietnamese dishes or the sushi, the cooks make every plate look amazing. The place is a little pricey. Its easy for two people to shell out $50 or more for a dinner. But considering our takeout total, its possible to eat here without breaking your wallet."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Pho Kim's sushi. I have been a regular customer for about four years, and Pho Kim is my favorite sushi in Pittsburgh. The staff is always so kind and polite. The owners regularly acknowledge and show that they appreciate our patronage. Even when this quaint restaurant is packed, the wait for a table or food has never been very long."}
{"text":"Great sushi and pad Thai. Not the best hibachi I've had, but definitely good."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We moved from out-of-state, and miss our local Vietnamese restaurant terribly.  Ordered the fresh spring rolls, which were great, especially dipped into the  hoisin sauce.  Also got the pho tai--and I will say that I prefer my beef sliced thinner.  It's a personal preference, as I'm not one to eat meat rare.  When it's sliced thin and the hot broth is poured over it, I feel it's more flavorful and tender.  My pho had chunks of thickly sliced beef that was still slightly pink, even after the soup had cooled some.  Otherwise, the soup was filling. I throw in all the sides--even the jalapenos (those damn pips can be pretty spicy at times).  I would also recommend the taro boba tea, which I never had and only ordered at the recommendation of our server. Our server was kind, and we were given \"complimentary\" ice cream at the end of our meal. All-in-all, I am happy with this place, and want to venture through their other items which are standard fare on a Vietnamese/Thai menu.  I didn't try any of the Japanese food, so I cannot attest to the quality of that.  Great service, great boba tea, good pho, enjoyable dessert.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like was my meat had more fat than meat. I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day and everything was super delicious. I got pho, my bf got kung pao chicken and we shared fresh spring rolls and mochi ice cream. Will definitely come back to try new things."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Pittsburgh for a hockey tournament and were looking for a non-chain restaurant.   I searched for \"pho\" thinking that a nice hot bowl of noodle soup would hit the spot after spending a few hours in a cold ice rink.  We were not disappointed when we arrived at Pho Kim 88.  My husband had the fresh spring rolls, which accurately described them.  Nice sweet shrimp, crunchy vegetables, and a delicious peanut sauce were the perfect combination for a delicious appetizer.  I had the steamed edamame which were nice and salty and perfectly cooked.  I had also decided on a pot of ginger tea, the hot ginger filled liquid instantly warming me up.  I ordered the rare beef pho, and it was one of the best I've ever had. The broth was excellent, all flavors melding nicely, not one overpowering the other.  The condiments of basil, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapeño were perfectly fresh. I ate the entire bowl which was huge! My husband got the miso soup and said it was delicious. I took his word for it and didn't taste it, as I'm not a fan of miso. Even though I was stuffed at this point,  I also got a to-go coconut Boba tea because it's one of those things I can't get where I live and I love it.  The coconut flavor was good, but the usual tapioca I am used to was more like mango flavored poppers instead of chewy tapioca.   It wasn't bad, and I did drink it all, but I prefer the large chewy flavorless tapioca pearls.  The atmosphere was very comfortable and clean and the waitstaff very friendly and attentive.   If I lived here I would eat here several times a month!"}
{"text":"I just moved to PA from Westminster, CA (little Saigon) and have been craving pho for months. This is probably the only spot I have found on the east coast or anywhere that isn't in Orange County that actually tastes like the awesomeness I am used to on the west coast. Their satay tastes like it is homemade and is super spicy... Love it! Their pho bowl size is a good size. They only have one size but it's ok. They have small bowls that you can just ladle the pho into them and share. Really awesome. The place is clean, and the staff is very attentive and nice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about Pho Kim and unfortunately I can't agree. While the food satisfied my hunger, I can't say it really blew me away. There are many better Pho restaurants in the city, but unfortunately, Pho Kim is the only one in the South Hills. 

Many people say the sushi is really good here. The hubby got the Rolls Royce and a California roll (the sushi special #1) and they left a lot to be desired. Didn't taste fresh to me. I expected the Pho to be the star of the show and while it was better than the sushi, the soup was just alright. The broth lacked depth of flavor and was a bit on the salty side. 

I was really hoping this would be a good place for me to go to satisfy pho hankerings as it's right down the street from me. Unfortunately, I won't be stopping here when a pho craving hits."}
{"text":"This IS my favorite restaurant for Asian cooking and we love to go to Pho Kim 88. It's a small dining room, and it fills up pretty fast, especially on the weekends, because the food is excellent and prices are moderate. My favorites are the \"Royce's Roll\" and the \"Pad Thai,\" and the Vietnamese Fried Rice is the best I've ever had, including all of the places I tried while living in California for eight years. We have tried many different things on the menu and have never had a bad meal. Pho Kim 88 is BYOB, which makes it a more affordable dining option if you like to have a glass of wine with your meal."}
{"text":"My friend and I met here for an early dinner on a Thursday night. Based on the reviews and having a coupon from the Enjoy Book for a BOGO entree, we thought \"why not\"! We were one of the first ones in the restaurant for dinner and the place was pretty quiet. Our waiter was pleasant and quick to serve us. Upon opening the menu, I was surprised at the amount of options there were including Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai. My friend and I decided to split two entrees, Chicken Fried Rice and General Tsos Chicken with sticky rice. The General Tsos was absolutely amazing! By far the best I have ever had. The sauce had just enough tang, the broccoli was tender, and the chicken was plump and juicy. As for the fried rice, it was not bad but could have used a little more flavor. It was served with a sauce that may have been intended to be the solution, however I was not a fan of it. 

By the end of our time together, my friend and I had half of each dish left and were able to split it to take home. Our waiter kindly took the dishes and boxed the entrees for us. By the time we were leaving, the place was filling up for dinner. Little did we know that it was a BYOB establishment - noted for the future! 

I intend to take my husband here in the future to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pho Kim 88 quite a few times. I used to even look forward to it. Unfortunately, the last 3 times I have visited the restaurant and/or gotten takeout these was an issue with something. Vegetarian rolls with shrimp in them, forgotten dishes, etc. I think the food is pretty good, but it's very pan-Asian. They're nice people, and I like the boba tea, but a think a little focus on service and accuracy may be in store."}
{"text":"I've gone here since they opened and I'm always satisfied. Royce Roll is the best sushi and suffices for a full meal. Hibachi is always fresh and a large portion.   Sushi has never let me down here either. The guy that owns this place is always super friendly too and remembers that I always get an avocado smoothie."}
{"text":"This is the first Vietnamese restaurant that I've came across in Pennsylvania. I have to say that it was good and I enjoyed it. It was more expensive than I'm use to paying but all the food up here has been more expensive. Definitely worth a try if your in the mood for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"2 words. LOVE IT.  Mystical waterfall - check, golden cat waving at you - check, fake orchid with 9 billion flowers - yahtzee!!!  This placed had me at torpedo shrimp, ok Im not sure if they were actually torpedo shrimp but they should have been.  I love eating at this place.  One of the few places where I may continue dining until I soil myself.  At one point I was considering just having the waitress just dump my food into a wood chipper and shooting it over towards my mouth.

I know some of you haters are gonna say its not the greatest, but it's a pretty good deal for the quantity and it is also pretty good quality.  The sushi ain't half bad either.  It also helps that it is about 50 feet from where I live.  Definitely worth a try if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Have been seeing Pho soup pop up an Andrew Zimmeran's shows and finally decided to go to get some.  The place was cozy, perfect for a date, not too loud, not too busy and the server came over right away.  I don't have a problem telling someone if I don't have experience and today wasn't any different.  The server suggested the basic noodle bowl so we ordered that and another of my new interests- a bento box.  
The good- the bento box contained a California roll which was nice & fresh, perfectly rolled and rather full.  It was delicious.  The chicken on a stick was teriyaki and perfect as well.  The steak cubes were marinated and cooked perfect but a bit tough to chew (so I wouldn't blame them).  The rest of the ingredients were rather good but not so good as to make them memorable.     
The bad- my taste for lemongrass.  If you aren't familiar- I looked it up for you...  Lemongrass: Related to citronella, this bulbous, greyish green tropical grass is a favored herb in Southeast Asian cuisines, where its delicate, lemony essence permeates a wide assortment of dishes. In Thai cooking, lemongrass is used most frequently to flavor soups, salads and curries. Had I looked it up first, seeing that the first thing it says is 'related to citronella...' I should have ordered something else.  Lemongrass is STRONG.  I can't say it tastes like anything I have ever tasted before and now I know I'm not a fan.  But if you are, this bowl was stuffed with noodles, vegetables, came with a side of fresh jalapeños (at my request, as I told the server we liked spicy) and some dry rice noodle crackers.  Again- if you like lemongrass- this soup would have been perfect.  I wanted to like it, but I just can't.  Again- nothing against the restaurant, just the flavor of lemongrass...  See where I'm going here?  
Thanks for reading.  :)"}
{"text":"This place has great Pho and sushi. I've been going here for awhile. I left Pittsburgh for 3 years and now I'm back and Pho Kim was one of the places I had to hit up immediately! The service isn't amazing but they're nice and their food is really great! I love their Pho so much. The portions are huge, too. Always love going here."}
{"text":"A quiet place right outside the city. Friend and I found this place randomly and we were satisfied with it. We both had the classic Pho Tai. I'm usually really skeptical about most pho places, but this one had really flavorful broth and huge portions. The sliced beef was the only thing I was iffy about. It ended up being slightly dry despite and the portion of meat was very small. For the price I would say this place was decent."}
{"text":"Im giving this one star just because the food is good.  New ownership took over from what the rude blonde haired lady that claims to be the new owner said.  We ordered the steak roll and it came out wrong didn't have half the stuff it claimed to have on the menu in it, we informed the waiter who sent the owner over she acted very unprofessional and said that she would just take it away, and wouldn't even let me explain what was wrong with it while comparing it to the menu she just kept cutting me off and then walked away.  The best part is we had a groupon that we showed the waiter before we even sat down who said that we could use this coupon right off the phone and no need to print it.  When our meal we over the we go to use the groupon and the owner litterely started arguing with my wife in front of customers about how it needs to be printed and did not care what the waiter said.  Needless to say I told her that she has terrible customer service, and John the old owner should have never sold his business to her, mark my worss she will run this place into the dirt.  We use to be regulars once a week and will never be returning to this place, I will also spread the word to friends and family so they don't return.  John or Kim if you still read these, its a shame you let this woman run a business with Kim's name it, she is a disgrace to a business that you built and made so wonderful!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Would not recommend. Server couldn't answer any of my questions. Asked if a meal was vegan or what I would have to hold to make it vegan. She didn't know what I was talking about. Explained what I meant and said that I could do tofu. Asked about the sauce and was told that it was made with fish sauce. My joiner and I received our meals at different times. Server never checked back. Got the attention of another server to question the food that was delivered to my joiner and was told that's what he ordered when it was actually totally different to what the menu said. I'd rate the overall taste at 2/5."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite spots in the city.  In fact, when I get to pick the restaurant, it is almost always Pho Kim.  We love to get the dinners which include full courses:  soup, salad (their ginger dressing should be bottled and sold en masse), tempura shrimp, main course, and dessert.  It's so much food, but sooo good.  I love the Chicken Teriyaki, myself.  The two of us get out, with tip, just under $50, but that's for the dinners.  If you went with one of the standard meals or specials, you'd spend quite a bit less.  They also have sushi, though we haven't been able to force ourselves away from our favorites long enough to try something new yet."}
{"text":"Pho Kim 88 can be hit or miss, hence only 3 stars. Usually it's quite good, and I'm a fan of the bun (vermicelli noodles with choice of meat) and the pho. I don't eat red meat, so I really appreciate that fact that they have chicken broth for their chicken soup (hu tieu ga). The chicken broth is excellent here, and the sides of veggies and herbs are always fresh and plentiful. We had been ordering the vermicelli noodles here for years (literally) and the chicken had this terrific marinade, and they grilled it perfectly, and then one day we ordered it, and it was a if it was from another restaurant...flavorless, no marinade, really bad.  I called and complained, and they were nice and offered me a free meal, but that's not what I wanted...I wanted it back the way it was! Sometimes now it's good, and sometimes not, so inconsistency in the kitchen from cook to cook. When they iron this out, they'll get 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  

So I judge every Vietnamese restaurant by my only childhood experience relevant to Vietnamese restaurants - my friend's Vietnamese immigrant mom's cooking.

And yes, Pho Kim 88 passed the Li test!  

Yes, it's clean blah blah blah.  The most important is it passed the Li test!!!  I like.

Yep, still love it.  

The steak salad is amazing.  Even if they do use jalapenos instead of the small Vietnamese red peppers."}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere. Friendly and knowledgable waitstaff.

No alcohol but for $2 per person you can bring your own.

Had the pho bun bo hue. It was great. The presentation was amazing and large enough for two people. Very spicy.

Also ordered two sushi rolls. The sexy Phoenix was pretty good. 3 kinds of chef special sauce. The royce's roll was ok. The fish was cooked.

Pricing wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"The pho here is not excellent. It's not great. It's not even good. It's just -- OK.

Nothing I ordered here was great. The whole place looks like it's the set of Chungking Express. It's so 90's it hurts, but feels good man. If you're big into 90's stuff you should honestly come here to see it, it's a relic.

The food in general falls pretty flat. The menu is massive and they have so much on it, it's scary. I didn't try the sushi because I looked around at the restaurant and I did not trust that they would serve safe sushi. Also, most of their sushi recipes are really not even remotely Asian. Kind of grossed me out.

All in all, I think it's better to avoid this place. There must be better pho in town."}
{"text":"Some of the best Vietnamese around especially in the South Hills. I'm still partial to Tan Lac Vien in Squirrel Hill but this restaurant is owned by a family member so it's super similar and equally delicious. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming which is always a bonus. Pho Kim 88 offers sushi, Thai, and popular Chinese dishes too - a nice diverse menu so even the picky eaters can find something. 

When I'm sick or under the weather I always get the pho. It magical and with a doubt shortens my colds. The pho broth is flavorful and hearty without being overly salty or concentrated but my go to when not sick is the Bun Vermicelli with pork and a pot of ginger tea. I could have this 5 days a week!"}
{"text":"Delicious, large helpings of pho. A little costly, but worth it as you are left feeling very satisfied. One of the best pho places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I figured it was about time to update my review on Pho Kim after having dinner there last night.  This place remains one of my favorite sushi spots in town!  The amount and quality of food that you get here for the price really can't be beat.  They now offer Hibachi Boats which are, quite literally, a BOATLOAD of food.  Soup, salad, hibachi chicken, steak, or shrimp, 2 pieces tuna sashimi, 2 pieces salmon sashimi, 4 pieces shrimp tempura, 4 pieces California roll, and edamame... for $16.  Yep, you read that right.  SIXTEEN. DOLLARS. for all that food!!  It's a freakin' steal if you do the math off of the menu (the sashimi alone would run you $10).  You get a little bit of everything so it's perfect if you can't make up your mind between sushi and hibachi!  

My SO selected the shrimp boat and was thoroughly pleased with his choice.  I ordered Lucky Buddha #1 which is soup, salad, a Cali roll, and (our favorite) a Royce Roll.  $15.  Again, what a deal!   We had so much food, took some home, and the bill was only $33.

The staff is so nice, there are plenty of TVs to keep you occupied, and their onion/Pho Kim soup is the best I've ever had. It actually has flavor to it, which can't be said for so many other restaurants.  I look forward to many more meals here at Pho Kim and highly recommend you get there yourself!"}
{"text":"Great Asian variety.  Cant be beat IMO. On weekends this place is usually packed, and for good reason, it's delicious. We ordered our \"Valentines Day\" take out of Chicken Pho-Ga, Shrimp Pad-Thai and the Fresh Spring Rolls.   The pho rivals some of the best we've had on the east coast.  Want it spicy? You can get it spicy.  Chocked full of noodles, meat, veggies, and jalapenos it's a meal in itself. Yum!  The Pad Thai had many large shrimp with a great balance of noodles and veggies and we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow.  The fresh spring rolls were nice and cool, the perfect temp.  Not rubbery either.  Stuffed full of fresh veggies and shrimp, as the name implies.  
Just an FYi this place is BYOB or BYOW, a cork charge applies but then you are not paying commercial bar prices.  A win-win."}
{"text":"Pho Kim is AWESOME!  Seriously one of my top 2 Asian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.  If you o, be sure to try the Pho.  If you are adventurous, don't be shy to try one with beef balls and tripe.  If not, go with something a little more basic.  Either way, you get the same great broth and delicious taste.

Also, if you are looking for a starter, the fresh spring rolls are a favorite along with the Catching Fire roll.  The Catching Fire is a sushi roll loaded with goodness and topped with jalapenos for the \"fire\".  Taro bubble tea tops off any meal here or you can BYOB for a very minimal fee."}
{"text":"Not only do they have great Pho, surprisingly, they have awesome sushi, too! The sushi chef is meticulous with both ingredients and with his/her presentation.

I love the ambiance, too. It has a very chill vibe to it. Service is always with a smile."}
{"text":"I got the pho shrimp. It was delicious and a huge portion that filled me up. The waitress even gave me extra broth because I was running low."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered three menu items this evening: Chicken Pad Thai, Bun Bo Deluxe, and the Spicy Thai Wings. I loved the chicken pad Thai, but would have preferred it be spicier (I added sriracha), I did not like the wings but my boyfriend did. They were not spicy either. The Bun Bo Deluxe was good but not heavily seasoned so was a bit bland. Overall, it was good but I prefer more spice and flavoring in this type of food."}
{"text":"BYOB! Very high quality food. I've never had any complaints anytime I have eaten here. Very unique sushi selection, and great dinner choices as well! I always recommend this place to those traveling to the South Hills area. Try this place, you'll love it! Especially when it's chilly outside! Their pho is out of this world!"}
{"text":"With a bottle of wine in hand (hint: they're BYOB), hubs and I headed to Pho Kim for dinner on a recent Saturday night. Upon entering I noticed the sign on the door stating that they now serve breakfast?! Wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast but it might be worth trying out. When we entered, we were seated immediately seeing there were only about 3 other occupied tables. We sat directly in front of the sushi maker. Our waitress opened our bottle of wine and we ordered. I was really in the mood for hibachi so I ordered the hibachi chicken which came with a shrimp appetizer, soup and salad. Hubs went with the sushi. Within what seemed like seconds, my shrimp appetizer and soup were served. The shrimp consisted of large tempura fried shrimp. No sauce with it and not deveined. No thanks. I passed to hubs who was also not interested. My salad then arrived. Not much to say here either. Typical iceberg, cabbage, carrot mix with ginger dressing. Before I could get halfway through my salad, my entree was served garnished with a huge radish rose the size of half a cantalope. Poor hubs had nothing at this point. My hibachi was typical. Fried rice was good, veggies are soft, chicken was tasty. Everything was very average for me at this point. When hubs sushi was finally served, half way through my meal, he also felt that it was average. Not the best he has had and not the worst. The most redeeming quality of the meal was the fried ice cream. The crisp, warm breading around the cold ice cream was a perfect match. Topped with chocolate sauce and whipped cream for the perfect treat. Remember going to the fair as a child and getting a funnel cake with ice cream on top? It was like that except with chocolate as well. Yum. All in all, I might head back to Pho Kim but will probably not get the hibachi again."}
{"text":"so mean...so rude...and the noodle soup so cold...pho noodle with beef...the beef look so pink with blood...the short hair server is so rude.ask her something?she is so mean.didn't take care you and let you to ask somebody else.don't want to come back again."}
{"text":"Chicken pad thai was OK but a little bland and large noodles were mushy.
Dad's General Tso's chicken was very good"}
{"text":"Recently remodeled.  I have been here twice in the last 2 weeks.  Both times I had their curry, once red and once green.  Both were excellent and I would do it again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wohoo! As good as it gets! Indeed

I haven't had a \"Gotta loosen my belt\" moment in a long time.. not even during thanksgiving dinner. This has to be one of the best restaurant that I've been to so far. It definitely exceeded my expectation in terms of \"food\". (Gotta mention the food since people tend to rate the decoration aspect as well)

I had the Combo Vermicelli Noodles Dishes aka Bun (Highly Recommended) which comes with Vermicelli Noodles of course, served with Lettuce, beansprout, onion, cilantro, basil, cucumber,carrot,spring roll, grilled shrimp, chicken, pork, beef, peanut, sesame seed with fish sauce. My girlfriend and her friend got the Hu Tieu Ga (Noodle Soup) and Saigon Pancake Crepe which they both loved it. Need I remind, the price is very reasonable to the generous portion size.

Although they do offer various dishes, this is a Vietnamese and Japanese restaurant - so when you do go.. please stick to ordering Vietnamese and Japanese dishes. If you like Pad Thai (which I do) I suggest you go to a Thai restaurant instead.

Also, it's BYOB! which I didn't realize until we got there."}
{"text":"The bubble teas are small but awesome. I'm not into raw food so this place isn't my favorite but the pad Thai and pineapple rice are very good! Spring rolls aren't fried so I ordered them but didn't try them. Husband loves their sushi!"}
{"text":"We were around the area and wanted some pho. The restaurant itself didn't look bad. We ordered two bowls of pho which by the way were kind of pricey. It looked pretty good when it came out but boy was it deceiving. The meat was cut too thick and I didn't like the texture. Note that I had plenty of pho in different areas. The soup tasted horrible. Not sure what they did to it but it also smelled pretty bad. I didn't like it at all. The only reason I'm giving it an extra star is because they gave us two free mochis icecream at the end which was a nice treat. I think that they give you the icecream instead of fortune cookies. Overall,  I will not be returning here for pho which was really disappointing."}
{"text":"Not only does Pho Kim 88 offer superior sushi and other Asian cuisine than many other establishments in the area, but their customer service is top notch. My family and I ordered take-out on a Saturday evening; our food was ready faster than the 20 minute wait time that they gave us, and the hostess and cooks were extremely friendly. They also gave us a free order of dumplings since our order total was over $50! Definitely a high recommend."}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese place with sky-high prices relative to other spots in the city. Pho Kim 88 is great because of its location but there are better places to go if you are not in the neighborhood and are looking to get your Pho on."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and the food is always really food. The service is not always so good. The server walked by 3 times saying she would be right with us. She got us water but took the water pitcher with her when everyone else had one on the table. We ordered our food and be bubble tea. She said the bubble tea would be right it twice as she zipped by. Another server brought is our food. Still no bubble tea. We finally had to flag down another server and she got it for us. Our server never returned to check on us or fill our water. I had to drink from my kids sippy cup because I dying. We finally got tired of waiting for our bill and got up. Our server then appeared with the bill. We told her we had purchased a deal from Local Flavor which was worth $20 off our bill. She informed us that it had to be printed.  The deal was like a Groupon and did not state it had to be printed. It was an online voucher that they could mark as redeemed once used. She asked the manager and they still wouldn't slow us to use it. It was absurd."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have had PHo since I moved to Pennsylvania, and thanks to Yelp I found. Gem in Pittsburgh!!!! I will be going out of my way from time to time to eat here whe heading to the outlets and such:-) 

I ordered the fresh spring roll and they came out and I tell they were super fresh and they tasted delicious!!! I mean delicious I ate two all by myself and dared my fiancé to look at them. The menu has a large selection however I wanted pho so I decided on the pho Tai:) basic bowl of pho with rare beef. The pho came out and was the biggest bowl of pho I have ever seen in my life! I guess the waitress knew I was joansen (sp) either way I ate it all, I could t finish the meat but I did murder the bowl of  pho!!

The juice was perfect the pho was perfectly cooked the noodles were not overdone not was the noodles were perfect!! To make a perfect dish even better they brought out Japanese I team at the end! Yum!! It was delicious just a different consistency:-) this place gets five stars from this three time Yelp elite and I will for sure be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I was seriously surprised by how good the food was - I went with a good friend of mine who had been to Pho Kim 88 many times in the past and she said the quality of the food was MUCH better than its been in the past.  I got the pho gai with tofu, they were happy to accommodate a change, and the broth was delicious, the veggies were all fresh and the tofu was perfect.  The prices were very reasonable and the service was great.  Note: they do not have a kids menu, so I brought outside food for my 3 year old and they had no problem with it at all.  I'm excited to eat there again, especially since I heard their hibachi is great!  Plus we live right behind the restaurant so I can't wait to go again next week!!"}
{"text":"Having had pho in Seattle for the first time and then trying it here, I was a bit disappointed. The portion was generous BUT...
-the sprouts were a bit old
-the broth was thin, which is my biggest issue with it
-the beef was overcooked
Overall it was fine and I will probably eat there again when in the south hills. But dadgum it won't like it!"}
{"text":"Very sweet and attentive staff. At both locations. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is delightful! I love this little gem. Strongly recommend their Pad Thai and Pho! Quick, easily, simple, delicious! And it's BYOB!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant that I have been to in the last year.  Just about everything was below par.  We found a hair in the Tom yum soup.  The chicken in two dishes tasted like it was on the edge.  The tuna sashimi was about the only thing that was decent.  This place is not clean.  The carpet was filthy in the middle of the afternoon.  Avoid."}
{"text":"The place was very clean. Hard to spot because of how dark it was... But very clean. Service and food was fast and efficient. The chicken broth for the pho was incredible. Large portions and great food. 

Hint: tofu pho isn't listed on the menu, but it's available."}
{"text":"I love this place when I visit Pittsburgh. I enjoy the fried cheese whontons and fried dumplings to start. Then hibachi chicken or spicy chicken for dinner. Finishing with fried ice cream with some hot fudge sauce! Find them in Clipper Magazine and on Local Flavor. They have great coupons and a 50% off deal when you can get it. Pho Kim 88 is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We are in the Pittsburgh area visiting from our home outside of DC. My daughters grandmother is Vietnamese and an awesome cook. This food is the best we've ever had compared to hers. We will be back tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was very pleasant but the food was unappealing. The textures and flavors were just off. My $12.50 Thai basil curry was about 1/4 celery. Even the veggie fried rice wasn't tasty, it was oily and bland."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Royce Roll is the best ! Get it well done with STEAMED shrimp inside!  The Vietnamese Pancake is also one of my faves! I get it with shredded chicken and shrimp with extra fish sauce and it's delicious"}
{"text":"It's good!  I'll definitely come back.  The bubble tea is strange, though perhaps there was a lapse in communication.  I'm used to milk teas with tapioca.  What I got had whipped cream on it (strange) and the tapioca were actually filled with mango juice.  Not bad, just not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian food place in Pittsburgh. I am usually guilty of ordering American style Asian but no need here! (They do have it though!) The creamy shrimp with coconut and pineapple on a bed of lettuce is my absolute favorite! BYOB and an amazing atmosphere. Can sit, relax, and drink wine with amazing food. Fantastic place to eat and they have coupons in the clipper and enjoy book which often they don't even collect. Super worth it- great value."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here - service was good but not necessarily friendly, that's ok.  Everything was good - really liked their spring roll and cheese wontons.  My favorite part was the Pad Thai - It was unlike anything I have ever had before.  It's not all sauce, peanuts and standard noodles like every other place.  I ordered it with tofu and it was AWESOME - the noodles in their Pad Thai are really wide and taste homemade.  They kind of stick together and are just so delicious.  

Pad Thai gets a bad rap, snobby folks tend to think of it as ordering sweet and sour chicken - but Pho Kim 88's version is amazing and probably a lot different than what you are used to."}
{"text":"Pho Kim 88 is affordable and high class. Their staff is willing to adjust orders with ease. The general tso chicken is ideal and the special signature roll is a definite repeat order!"}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going, just do it. Go. It's one of my new favorites. Very good food, clean place, good service/friendly staff, reasonably priced.
I had the Vietnamese Fried Rice--it's become the new standard for rice IMO.
My wife had the Pad Thai, it, too, was also very good. We split a sushi roll that was impressive. Will go again."}
{"text":"Whew.

And I mean, whew.

My friend and I headed to Pho Kim on Saturday night. I'd always wanted to try it as its right by my house and I've heard great things, but hadn't for the first two years of living nearby. 

I was not missing a thing.

When we arrived, the place was packed, which was unexpected since we both though it would be kind of a dive. Not so: the interior was nicely decorated and we got more excited for the meal. Our server was very nice and the food was brought out quickly. If only the quality of the food was anywhere near the service, we would be grand. But no.

The pork spring rolls were ok-not very flavorful, and the meat was kind of mushy. My friend got a side salad with her meal, and I thought the ginger dressing was delicious! Thankfully, she ordered a big entree and gave me her salad. That and the spring rolls were the only things I could get down. 

The first downturn: she got her soup. I honestly forget the kind of soup because as soon as she sipped it she wrinkled her nose and held up a spoonful of it to me. 

\"Smell this.\" 
I did.
\"Does this smell like wet dog to you?\"

And yeah, it did. Exactly like wet dog.

\"Thankfully it doesn't taste like wet dog,\" she said, which was probably just  kind of her, knowing that I had ordered Pho.

I ordered the Pho Tai (rare beef) and it looked delicious when it arrived, with fixings--greens and sprouts--on the side. I picked up my spoon and sipped the broth, my excitement vanishing quickly. I glanced over at my friend.

\"Wet dog?\" 
Yup. Again, it smelled exactly like wet dog.
I switched to the noodles, hoping the smell wouldn't be overpowering. Nope. Still bad. I legitimately plugged my nose as I took a sip of the broth.

Off the look of disgust on my face, she asked : \"does it taste like wet dog?\" I responded that I didn't know, but it did taste like the bathroom air after giving Molly (you guessed it, my dog) a bath. 

  \"Then it tastes like wet dog, my friend.\"

After that conclusion, I made no more attempts at eating the meal. I did sniff the broth a couple more times, hoping in vain that the smell had gone away. It had not.

Now look, I'm not saying I was actually served dog as the meat in my meal. That's a crappy and disturbing stereotype that's thrown around at Asian restaurants far too often. What I am saying is that, regardless of what meal I ordered, it should not have tasted or smelled like my dog's bath time.

My friend's hibachi arrived somewhere in this dog smell saga, and while it all tasted fine, it was lukewarm at best. Fried rice? Cold. Shrimp? Cold. Steak? Cold.

Our server did apparently think it was one of our birthday's, since we were given a free mochi desert, so that was weird but nice. 

I'd love to give an extra star for the service but I don't think that's a fair rating for a restaurant I will never go back to."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the pho here. But I can tell you it's excellent. While there's a number of places to get pho in Pittsburgh this is one of the better places in my opinion. 

Who knew?! South Hills? 

Also their double meat portion (only +3!) comes out with a portion in the bowl and the double portion raw on a plate which made my day. The extra portion was huge and for the first time in my life I was full after a bowl of pho. 

Come here for the pho. It's definitely a winner.

Edit: a word"}
{"text":"Great food! My boyfriend and I come here with some regularity. When ever we are feeling a little under the weather we stop in for some good Pho. =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have frequented several of the city's pho options. This place by far was our favorite. 

We started our lunch with some Thai iced tea and shrimp spring rolls. The rolls were quite large compared to other places and the peanut sauce was very flavorful. The tea was not overly sweet, perfect. 

Next came the pho. I ordered the Pho Seafood and my husband the spicy kimchi seafood pho. We both received very generous portions, filled to the brim with lots of fresh seafood and noodles. Trust me, they don't skimp on the noodles! Both broths we seasoned well. My husbands kimchi broth was by far the best. A good combination of heat and spice. The seafood was not over cooked or chewy. 

Our server was very pleasant and made sure we had plenty of sauces, sprouts, and drinks. 

We will most certainly return! Hopefully to try the curries next."}
{"text":"I am from the SF bay area and have been missing Pho. Pho Kim 88 has very good for Pho for Pittsburgh. The place is a little out of the way but worth it. It comfortable and clean and you can BYOB."}
{"text":"Personally, I think this is the best Asian restaurant in the South HIlls, with the exception of their sister restaurant, Saigon 88.  My family has enjoyed countless meals at the Route 88 location (Library Road) and we have never been disappointed.  The service has always been fast and friendly.  They serve the best fried rice I've ever tried, and that includes a lot of MUCH pricier places in Southern California.  The Royce's Roll is my favorite on the sushi/sashimi menu, and you can tell that the fish is very fresh and of the highest quality.  The food is very fairly priced, and you can save quite a bit by bringing your own bottle of wine or a couple of beers in a cooler, as BYOB is OK here."}
{"text":"This place is hands down better than any nearby choice; especially chain restaurants. Service is polite and food is FRESH! I try new dishes every time and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the area at a great price!! Friendly staff. Amazing spicy Thai curry and great sushi combos. Been going here for years and it is always good."}
{"text":"Really,really good. I have eaten there so many times. I used to work in the same plaza. Really great people and even better food. I love everything they have and I have tried just about everything on the menu. My Vietnamese sister-in-law gives it a thumbs up for authenticity for what thats worth. The sushi blows Nakama and Little Tokyo out of the water dollar for dollar.  BYOB and they now have proper wine glasses thanks to our gift we gave them!!!(we love them so much we gave them a bunch of wine glasses for the holidays)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! We had the Las Vegas Roll, Pad Thai with Shrimp and Pho Thai. All were wonderful! Atmosphere is a little different, service wasn't the best, but the food was worth it! It's also BYOB. Prices are reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their sushi is top notch and their soups are great too. I wholeheartedly recommend the Tom Kha soup. But the reason we go to this restaurant is their pineapple bubble tea. It isn't on the menu, but they have it and it is beyond amazing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place. Their spicy tuna/yellow tail roll is always good never had one complaint. I try other sushi places but nothing else compares. Definitely worth going to experience."}
{"text":"Didn't love it..."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. It says authentic Vietnamese and Japanese cuisines. But, if the owners and cooks are not Japanese, how can you make them \"authentic\"? As I know, they speak Cantonese, they could be Chinese-Vietnamese. When me and my friends go there, we usually order Vietnamese noodle soup (huge portion) their spring rolls, and fried tofu which are DELICIOUS!! However, the soup base is just too salty for us, we always tell the waitress to make ours less salty. 

Service wise, I have to give them one star. The lady with short hair is so rude most of the time. If you happen to have her serving you...oh it's your lucky day then."}
{"text":"The best Pho and dumplings I've had in Pittsburgh  :) the ambience is great, servers are friendly, a little out of the way for people living downtown or used to walking to places in Sah side but it's really worth it, especially when you have a bad hangover on Sunday."}
{"text":"I'm used to going to my pho soup place in the strip district, but being at home, I wanted something closer. This was better than my usual place! I got the Pho Tai, which was beef broth with rare beef. The flavors were perfect, and it was very traditional pho. My boyfriend got the pineapple curry... It was amazing! Just spicy enough. They also give you little mochi's for dessert for free, and drizzle them with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. It was an overall nice experience, and the ambiance is nice as well."}
{"text":"After dining at Pho Kim 88  for the first time, we were very pleased with the food and the overall experience was satisfying. The decor is a little dated but overall the atmosphere is bright and enjoyable. Service was fast and friendly. Take out available. 

The food was delicious including the fresh spring rolls, phogan and sushi. We specifically had the crab, tuna and avocado sushi. They have many options including vegetarian. They have Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine. 

We will be dining at Pho Kim again for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been dining here for several years now.  The owner is very nice and the service is always friendly.  I like the lemograss chicken salad, the chicken bun and the pho ga and rotate my order as I go frequently.  They sometimes suffer from a little bit of inconsistency but it is rare that I have been unhappy and can definately recommend you go if you are in the area.  Pittsburgh has a couple better but you won't find a better Asian restaurant in the South Hills."}
{"text":"This place is okay but nothing to rave about. We ordered an avocado roll and spicy mayo which had some really good flavor but the chow fun was waaaaaaaaaaaay too salty. The service was super attentive and the food came out extremely fast (which I'm not sure is a good thing). Not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"The vermicelli bowl with pork and shrimp, sooooo good. I've had the Pho and sushi before, it's all delicious. Definitely a huge fan of this place but just moved to the East End so I'll have to make special trips out here when I can."}
{"text":"Pho Kim is a great little place on 88. It is one of my favorite places to get Pho or a Bento Box. I ordered a Pho with shredded chicken. They brought out a plate with fresh jalapeños, limes, basil, and sprouts. They also brought a bottle of Siracha and a bottle of Hoison sauce. Pho Kim is the only place that brings you Hoison sauce with Pho. The soup itself is in a huge bowl. It had lots of rice noodles, green onions, and shredded chicken in a very flavorful broth. I added everything to the soup except for the jalapeños. Then I added some Hoison sauce. It was a bowl of goodness. One of my sons got Chicken and Broccoli. I had a small taste and it was very good. It wasn't a typical bland brown sauce. I liked it so much I may order it on my next visit. My other son had Lovers Lo Mein. It was also good but needed more sauce. 
The service was a bit lacking. Our water was never refilled. In fact our server came back after our food was served. We had to flag her down to get more water and to get our check. 
Despite the less than desirable service I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. The decor is meh...but the service and food were excellent. We had the fresh spring roll with crab and shrimp and they were very good alongside some of the best PB sauce I've ever had. Next I had the Pho with beef and the portion was huge and tasty! We drove 20 min out of our way to try this place and we were not dissapointed, we'll be back again driving even further out of our way next week. :)"}
{"text":"Not what it used to be...4 stars before. My sushi came with the tuna on outside of the roll (?). Husband's entree had mushy veggies. Should have stuck with Little Tokyo which doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in Pittsburgh, their broth is wonderful - and is by far my fav restaurant! Just wish it was much closer to where I live as I don't get to make it out to Castle Shannon very often. Sushi is reasonably priced and good quality, better than any I've had at Nakama lol"}
{"text":"The pho was 6/10, but my issue was with the check out.  I advised the hostess that I was using a groupon.  At the end of my meal, a man came from the back of the restaurant and proceeded to take my phone for 5 minutes while trying to figure out what the groupon number was.  I showed him multiple times as well as showed him the button to redeem the groupon.  He insisted that I should have a paper copy, even though I have never used a paper copy with a groupon.  After 10 uncomfortable minutes of this angry man pushing buttons on my phone I finally was able to pay and leave.  The waitress was great and the food was ok but I will not be going back.  What a hassle."}
{"text":"MMMMMM. I was worried since I couldn't find a decent ramen place in the south Pittsburgh area (within a 30 minutes drive) that my Pho loving taste buds would receive yet another devastating blow. Pho Kim 88 does not disappoint. Not only do they serve Vietnamese cuisine but other oriental yum yums as well like Japan and Thailand. The dumplings are delicious, their Popping Boba Tea takes about 15 minutes to make so call ahead if it's for pick up, the Thai Tom Kha (spicy coconut milk seafood soup) is too amazing for words, both the fresh and fried spring rolls do not disappoint, their rolls although pricey are delicious, and the Pho tastes similar to my hometown's which I accept. 

I cannot give this place 5 stars though for the service. I don't mind the service with little to no smiles but when I did dine in our waitress was not quick to fill out our water no did she come to check on us for quite some time after the meal was delivered. It was not a busy lunch hour so I had to bump them a star. 

Overall, I am happy to have a decent Vietnamese restaurant down the street from my work. I still need to try new places to get a better idea but Pho Kim 88 is just so convenient and good that I may never venture out. It's definitely worth it to give the place a try."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  I used to come here all the time for lunch and absolutely loved it. Today, I'm a little disappointed. The menu is different, there's no lunch specials anymore, (big sad face here) and I basically got half the amount of food I normally do for about 40% more... (ordered the same thing I normally get)
They've definitely updated the decor, and it's much nicer. Thumbs up there. 
The updated menu however...big thumbs down. There's so much less to pick from. 
Bring back the lunch specials.
I totally understand prices needing to go up, but to not offer lunch options, almost makes it not a lunch option anymore.

However, all of that being said...the food is still awesome. Everything is always so fresh and good and the service is always great. Everyone is very nice and the atmosphere is comfy. I love you Pho 88, I'm just a little upset with you right now. ;)"}
{"text":"Damn it if a negative experience at a certain Castle Shannon bar 'n grill didn't force Kay and I to revisit this South Hills jewel of Asiatic delights a week or so ago. 

It appears as if the interiors have been redone since our last meal here, but the quality of the food has not. 

Unlike another reviewer, I enjoyed my Pad Thai, which I had with shrimp and found to be quite flavorful. The square rice noodles were perfectly al dente yet carried with them an indescribable richness. Furthermore, the shrimp was juicy, and the bean sprouts, carrot, garlic, egg, peanut, and egg were abundant. 

Our appetizer took us to the streets of Vietnam, the tender Saigon BBQ Short Ribs tantalizing our taste receptors with their honey-garlic-lemongrass marinade and cruncy, nutty sesame seed garnish. 

Whether or not Pho Kim 88 makes their own desserts is doubtful, but the cheesecake Kay and I shared was a warmed-over, fluffy, lardy, beautifully presented end to a fine dinner. 

Pho Kim still serves as a worthy ambassador of Asian cuisine in this quadrant of the Pittsburgh area. Give them a chance to charm you with exotic food and cordial service."}
{"text":"BYOB without a charge!  Good list of different choices for all the different and picky eaters, including our group. The place was packed with families.  Our server was a little pushy and kept telling a person who just wanted Veggie fried rice to order something else because fried rice come with most of the meals. 
My Spicy Kimchi Seafood was very good and the portion is large.  Asked our waitress about the spicy level and she said she would have it served mild.  Well that came out perfect for me with some good spiciness but you could still taste the food.  I'm sure we will return in the future."}
{"text":"Pho Kim 88 is one of my favorites! Every dinner selection that I've ordered comes with a rose carved turnip and some selections, like the phenomenal sushi, comes with an edible flower. This shows you the extra time, money and attention to detail that this restaurant invests in its patrons! Service is usually very good. The crab rangoons are absolutely amazing! I also enjoy their fresh spring rolls with peanut dipping sauce, although some less adventurous customers may be turned off by the transparency of the fresh roll's exterior. The Thai bubble tea was wonderful- very refreshing. No matter what sushi you order, it is wonderful and the presentation is outstanding. I ordered the Chicken Curry dish, which was very good! The ambiance of the place is nice with asian art and plants, an exotic fish tank and is dimly lit. The restaurant is not very big and has many tables, so on a busy night, one may feel slightly cramped or overwhelmed by the patrons voices carrying in the smaller room, but overall it is not too distracting. The quality of the food is really what makes this restaurant a favorite in my book, not to mention, the owner let my father and I in before they opened just to ensure quality customer satisfaction! This is a place that gives you ambiance, good service, phenomenal eats, and overall great feeling upon leaving!"}
{"text":"Food is great, never disappointed, when busy service can be a bit lacking but other wise no complaints"}
{"text":"Solid entry for Asian in the south hills of Pittsburgh. Rarely a wait, even on weekends, the abundant choices and reasonable prices are easy on the palate and wallet. The noodle soup bowls are particularly good."}
{"text":"i love you pho kim! we're there just about every other week! still the best sushi around! they have a new sushi chef. make sure you ask for his signature roll. crab inside, crab salad on top, THEN a piece of shrimp tempura. there is no way humanly possible to eat it in 1 bite, much less politely, but damn, it's delicious!!!
i was sick recently & canned soup wasn't cutting it for me. tom brought home some wonton soup. it was THE BEST tasting wonton soup i have ever tasted in my life!! i highly recommend it for those feeling ill, or if you just want some great soup!"}
{"text":"They always are so generous. The take out is almost always ready within a reasonable amount of time and is actually ready when they say it will be. 

The have traditional and Americanized Korean, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes.. They have absolutely mouth watering Pho.  The broth is best closest in the night, the longer it steeps the tastier it becomes.  If you like good food and are on the go, call in. If not stop in, sit @ the sushi bar and get some delicious bites!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the Pho is not bad at this place but anything else on the menu is below par. I ordered the pad Thai as well and it was so bland that I thought I ordered only rice paper. Service was not exceptional and it seemed that it could definitely be better."}
{"text":"In short: Pho is mediocre.  Coffee is EXPENSIVE.  Confused and disappointed with experience.

In Detail:   I ordered a bowl of pho and the vegetables that came along with it included herb, bean sprout, and what should have been fresh lime wedges, were already squeezed and used lime wedges. WTF!!!! Kind of irritated me that a 13 dollar bowl of pho couldn't be packaged with fresh lime wedges.  Anyways, I don't complain at restaurants while eating for fear of retaliation in mystery ingredients.  I just don't go back.  

Here is the other kicker to my experience. Before the menu was even given, the old lady waitress asked if I wanted Vietnamese Iced Coffee. \"Sure,\" I said.  She was excited and rushed off to make the coffee I guess and came back quickly.  Well when I started drinking the Vietnamese Coffee, I started to look at the menu.  I almost choked on the coffee.  It was 5 dollars!!!  What kind of specialty coffee is 5 dollars. This ain't no Starbucks Frappuccino with edible gold speckles.

I have eaten at tons of Vietnamese establishments in DC, NYC, Cali.  I have accepted Pho in Pittsburgh is way overpriced. But coffee....seriously....I have never seen Vietnamese Iced Coffee priced at 5 bucks.  From this place it tasted like powdered coffee in ice anyways.  Not Good.  Arrrgggghhhh???  That old lady........

 This is sadly the first and last time I will be at Pho Kim 88.  Best wishes to all future patrons."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I have experienced better\" that is what Yelp says two star means, and this is true. Sadly I have experienced better right here at this restaurant. I used to love this restaurant, the food was delicious, the menu was enormous, and the portions were decent....

Recently I brought my wife here after talking it up for a long time. They had chopped the menu into something barely recognizable, the portions were mediocre, and so was the food. I felt like an idiot and apologized to my wife.

It isn't a bad place to eat, but by no means is it the best in the locale anymore."}
