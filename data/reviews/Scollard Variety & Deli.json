{"text":"As other reviews suggest the ambience is really nice with all the regulars coming in and the staff is very polite. But the food was not that good. I had ordered their breakfast eggs and for 11 bucks it was fairly average."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for lunch if you're trying to find any affordable in Yorkville! Outdoor patio is serene and it's like a getaway from the hustle and bustle on Bloor, my little hidden gem.   The food is great and the service is always on point. Check this place out if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Took 10+ minutes to place our order and more than 40 minutes for it to arrive.  Sorry, no sandwich is worth the wait.  If there's even a hint of other folks in this establishment, I'd suggest dining elsewhere.  This establishment also committed the cardinal sin of a dining establishment - serving those who arrived after folks who were already waiting.  We watched people, who arrived 15 minutes after us, place an order and receive it before we received ours."}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful brunch in Yorkville. Huge portions, quality homemade food, fresh ingredients, personable service, good for groups, and they even have a piano that's in tune! This isn't your typical snobby Yorkville crowd for sure. Doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 7.5/10 Service: 9/10  A hidden local joint just behind Yorkville, I will definitely be back to grab a casual brunch here. You seat yourself, but will be served most likely by the owner.   Breakfast was great great great! Homefries were maybe the best I've ever had - piping hot and extra crispy.   I'm only taking points off for atmosphere, as the inside feels a little bit neglected. They also sell convenience-like store items at the front (toilet paper, juice, batteries), which adds a weirder vibe. But you know what? Food is great and well-priced, will definitely be back!  THE BOTTOM LINE: great food at non-Yorkville prices. Go for brunch!"}
{"text":"How I have missed this great little spot all the years I have been coming to Yorkville is beyond me!  But now that I know it's here, you can bet I'll be back time and time again!  Leave it to my trusty Yelp app to steer me to this cute place.  What looks like a home from the street turns into a combo mini store and restaurant once you pull open the door.  In the store part, you can find different sundries like toothpaste and toilet paper, razors (perfect as my friend forgot to pack his) and cleaning supplies.  Reminds me of the old general store concept where you could get pretty much anything you needed and a bite to eat!  Moving past the front, we were warmly greeted by Katerina who told us to \"sit anywhere\" and \"she would take care of us\"!  And she did.  We felt like we were guests in her home.  After taking our orders, she delivered them to Tom in the back who quickly began preparing our food and while it was cooking, we got to learn about her, her family and the Toronto area.  And just when we thought we had made a new friend, our food was up and Tom the chef (owner?) was there sharing hockey stories and making us feel like really valued guests, too so it was a special experience.  As for the food,it was really good.  I went with the omelette special which on this day was feta and spinach and my friend had the Denver omelette which was chock full of veggies and peppers.  It comes with your choice of bread and home made french fries which were also quite tasty!  If you want a soda, you pull it from the cooler that is right there or have a cup of their coffee which is promptly refilled.  And I think my breakfast was about $11 and Katerina told me if I had gotten up earlier, it was only $8.95 or something before10!  Crazy, right? (guess I'll always be paying the higher price as this girl likes to sleep in on weekends!)  This restaurant knows everyone in the neighborhood as people were coming in and ordering their \"usuals\" time and time again.  And the nicest part is you can sit and linger if you want or get in and get out.  It's your choice.  So the next time you are in the area looking for good food at a great price served by people who really make you feel special, check out the Scollard Deli.  It's not fancy, but you'll leave feeling full and really good about meeting some great people who believe that the customer definitely comes first!  Thanks Tom and Katerina for making our day!"}
{"text":"Nice little deli in Yorkville.  Stopped in for breakfast while in the neighbourhood.  Prices are insanely reasonable and service was amazingly friendly. Good coffee and prompt service.  I had the spinach omelette which came with toast and home fries.  It was very good."}
{"text":"Phenomenal find in the Yorkville area!  Tucked away on a small street, Scollard Variety & Deli has a lovely breakfast served until 11:30am for 9.95 (including eggs, sausage/bacon/ham, home fries - so good!, toast, orange juice and bottomless coffee WHOA). The pancakes are also fluffy, buttery and delicious. In an infamously pricy area, this is a definite gem.  What makes SV&D even better is the warm and friendly service (and a cute backyard patio to boot).  Already looking forward to coming back.  P.S. Their hot sauce is sriracha (not tobasco) - bonus in my books!"}
{"text":"Value for money (VFM) food here is their deluxed sandwiches. My friend tried their Toasted Western sandwich with garden salad and hand cut fries ($9.50 before tax). Generous portion, fresh garden salad, and yummy fries.  I had the Western All Day Omelette with toast, coleslaw and hand cut fries ($11.95 before tax which was not bad either.  Overall an enjoyable lunch here; courteous and attentive staff, fairly quick service, friendly atmosphere and prices were good for Yorkville area's standards."}
{"text":"Loved this, both local and fun and affordable. Plus giant portion for the price point. Then you get a waitress who wants your name, tells folks what they really want for lunch and asks you how you like your bacon at breakfast. I've had I don't know how many feta omelettes but this was simply the most feta filled since my greek godfather made them for me. Yum! And coffee, juice is included, not one or the other but both. The lunches are huge, the salad is on point and the lamb burger was as good as breakfast. Coming back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Hidden in the Yorkville area a couple blocks North of Bloor, this very small cute deli and mini mart is charming, with very good food, at low prices. Katarina is the women who greets you. I came back the second day and she greeted me by name. This is my new breakfast place."}
{"text":"Good breakfast option in the neighbourhood. Personalised service from the staff. Very quiet and mellow. Good food. And a grocery store too. I think the people that work here are the thing that would keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I come down to Scollard quite often as my hair salon is located there. I can't believe I did not notice this little gem (not so little) of a caf√©. Great for lunch, they serve sandwiches, baked goods, some hot dishes, and many espresso drinks. I had a very nice iced latte. The staff/owners were so kind and attentive, even took me for a tour to their back patio (which is beautiful). When I had to go, I didn't have to ask, they put my drink in a take out cup. They have been around for quite a while, I'm glad I finally discovered it. :)"}
{"text":"Downtown in the Yorkville area enjoying the beautiful day.  Found this interesting little shop on the street.  From the out side you think you may have something here.   When we got in I noticed a very cute patio in the back.  We sat ourselves and waited for a while before we got a menu. Our wait staff was very pleasant and interesting all at the same time.   The feature was the Lamb Burger with fries and salad.  Unfortunately they were out of fries by 1pm.   The great thing about the place everything seems to be made fresh.  The food was quite good and great value for the area. The coffee and espresso was tasty.   At the end I don't think I had the best  experience in this place considering the great reviews.  I think I will have to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I feel more at home here than I ever did in my own home. Best grilled cheese in town. Food made with LOVE. 10/10. Also sell cigs and TP incase you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great little spot to pop in for a quick bite. I had a short window of time to grab breakfast and I was able to be in and out around 30 minutes. I never felt rushed but service was quick and the food was great for a quick breakfast. It was fun to watch the regulars from the surrounding salons and the neighborhood pop in as the owner knew most of them by name as well as their orders. Full breakfast with coffee and juice was under $10 which in yorkville is a steal!"}
{"text":"I work in Yorkville, which used to make buying lunch a whirlwind adventure. I desperately ran in and out of restaurants, searching for affordable food and good portion sizes.   Then I found Scollard Variety & Deli. Thank Buddha! This place is so cute, has great service and delicious food. It has a small patio that looks out on Scollard Street. The patio only has two tables, but if one is empty, then it's the perfect spot for an afternoon lunch. It also has a large interior with a lot of seating. I always sit outside, read my book, eat my delicious garden salad and watch/judge passing pedestrians.   What to get: Garden salad (with Balsamic vinaigrette) is about $7 and totally worth it. I associate garden salads with boring rabbit food. However, this garden salad is special. You pick your dressing and the portion is huge. You get lettuce and tomatoes and cucumbers and radishes and peppers. They do not skimp out on the veggies! I always get a coffee when I'm there. I forgot the price, but my bill for the salad and coffee comes to less than $10, which is pretty amazing for a healthy Yorkville lunch... on a patio!  It's a local place and the owner (or at least I think he's the owner) is a really personable guy. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to support local business and enjoy a delicious lunch. Food is fresh, coffee is strong (if you want it to be) and the setting is perfect.   If you're in the area and need to grab food or coffee, avoid Starbucks and Lettieri. Visit Scollard Variety & Deli!  Location: 105 Scollard Street,  Toronto,  (416) 964-9326  Subway: Get off at Bay Station. Walk north along Bay. Make a left when you hit Scollard Street. Walk a couple blocks and you'll find it!"}
{"text":"The owners there are so homely, the feel at the restaurant is so comforting. The food is made with much love. If you are going down Scollard, you have to keep your eyes open, you can easily walk by it, there is no big flashing signs. 10/10 would recommend.  Tried the fish and chips there, spinach omelette and cheese omelette, all on separate occasions ofcouese. All tasted great."}
{"text":"Salads are really good but the best is the great service and good mood of his owner..."}
