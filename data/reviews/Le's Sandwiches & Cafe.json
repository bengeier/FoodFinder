{"text":"I love their sandwiches but the Plaza is really dirty.  I'd go all the time if it was located elsewhere.  hope they open another one somewhere safer and cleaner."}
{"text":"Ehhh...it was just \"ok\" bread was hard and sandwich was dry. This was my first trying bahn mi so I had very little to compare it too, however after reading the reviews, I suspect I expected more. 

Pro's - the place is super clean! And the staff was nice. The prices are also very reasonable. 

Con's - the location leaves more to be desired and the parking lot could potentially ruin your tires so be careful. The bread was very hard and the sandwich seemed dry. 

Overall, wasn't the worst experience ever, but also wasn't the best. I will be trying the yummi bahn mi food truck next, maybe then I will have something vaguely to compare it too."}
{"text":"Well, I must say I was really looking forward to trying this place based on the rave reviews. However, it was very hard to find...omg! I finally located it in this raggedy strip mall...The area is pretty deserted and very rundown...POTHOLES galore! It's kinda scary over there, I wouldn't go alone just my personal preference. On to the sandwich...my sandwich bread was really over toasted and actually kind scratched the roof of my mouth in the midst of creating a zillion crumbs everywhere. The pork def had a good taste and although I was not expecting a lot of meat, I did think the amount was TOO little. One slice of that yummy pork just didn't cut it for me or my hubby.  The veggies were really good compliments and added nice crunch. I would have enjoyed more of a condiment to bring everything together as I couldn't really detect the butter/pate spread the sign said was on it (maybe due to over-toasting?). The owner was super friendly and that makes me want to visit again in spite of my not-so-great first experience...I'd prob give it another shot, one day."}
{"text":"A sandwich as good as Le's Banh Mi #6 will make you forget every pothole on your way to flavor heaven."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the banh mi sandwiches here. I ordered the bbq pork and a strawberry bubble tea. The pickled veggies were crunchy and delicious! I could've ate another half of a sandwich. My bf ordered the other pork sandwich but I enjoyed mine better. He also ordered the sugar cane drink and enjoyed it but it was too sweet for my taste. I know what do you expect from a drink just made with sugar cane! (With a touch of orange) The man running the place was a bit rude to me when I asked him a question but I would still go back to eat their sandwiches. Don't forget to bring cash no cards accepted."}
{"text":"Heaven on earth! Sandwiches are the best banh mi in town!"}
{"text":"I have always said dont judge a book by its cover and this pertains to this place. The outside may look a lil rough but believe me u will not regret it. I have been looking for a banh mi place since I moved here and found this place thanks to yelp! After reading the reviews I decided to try it and I definitely did not regret it even tho my BF was a bit hesitant because of the location. He loved it! He had never tried banh mi before but I have all my life and these are great!  My bf prefers the #6 the pork banh mi but my favorite is the #7 banh mi dac biet its sooooo good! You should all go I bet you will be going back for more like we do! Also the bubble teas are good too I like the mango and bf likes the honeydew. Also a tip: bring cash because thats all they accept."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, had amazing service and delicious food! Would absolutely come back again, again, and again. 

I got the pork with jalapeños and it was super crisp and flavorful with nice crispy bread. Overall I'd give it 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Wow...what an interesting experience. I knew the food had to be good if people are willing to traverse such treacherous terrain for a sandwich. I had to swerve around craters, I mean potholes, in the parking lot and then walk through what appeared to be an abandoned mall in a third world country to reach the restaurant.

Once inside, I felt a sense of relief. The restaurant was clean and the staff were very friendly. I had the #6: a pork sandwich with pickled veggies and fresh cilantro for $3.75. OMG, what a great deal. The sandwich was simple, fresh and delicious for under four bucks. They must be making their money on sodas. My can of coke was $1. But I can't complain, the meal is the best value I've gotten for lunch in years. 

This place takes hole-in-the-wall to a whole new level and I love it! It's cash only and most people order take-out.  Add this place to your list. The food is fresh and fabulous."}
{"text":"Cash only, awesome bahn-mi and housemade jerky. As other reviews have pointed out, it's in a dead mall...but whatever- this place is awesome and the location isn't hurting them. Basically everything on their menu is well worth the drive and any *uncomfortable feelings*  you might have in an unfamiliar atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is always great! Not good, not okay but GREAT! the prices are stellar and the owners are always nice!"}
{"text":"Their sandwich is always fresh, the bread crusty yet light and soft on the inside.  I always get the grilled pork (#6) and the pork is done just right doesn't have excess fat (the same cannot usually be said for the other banh mi places I tried).  The shop is also spotlessly clean - hence the consistent 98+ sanitation rating.

Worth the trip even if it's located in one of the worst \"mall\" settings in the area."}
{"text":"About as authentic as a Bahn Mi can get right down to the charming second world atmosphere the mall offers. Cash only. But everything is pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Felt like a Tarantino movie.... 

Been reading about Le's for some time and craving the amazing combination of crispy / crunchy / sweet / sour / hot and unctuousness that is Banh Mi. I heard Mr. Le had the best in town. 

Pulled into the broken down parking lot, and headed toward the entrance, half way to the door, turned around to make sure the car was locked....  I enter at the wrong side so walk through a large empty echo-y building, no sign for the place, no people, no business. I turn to the right and continue walking... past the shuttered stores with old orthopedic barcaloungers and dated travel posters, past the two  Asian gentlemen smoking cigarettes in a dimly lit doorway. I hear my own footsteps and fully expect to be relieved of the twenty I just got from the ATM. In the distance I see \"Le's Sandwiches\", it seems darker than it should, but  pick up the pace because I have found the place. I get to the door, it says \"Closed Wednesday\" I am crushed...  

Back the next day, I am rewarded, it IS the best Banh Mi in town. I get a #6, and a water. sit at one of the few tables, eventually look up and there is a table of four smiling at me. They tell me they drive 45 min from SC once a week to partake in Mr. Le's Sandwiches. #6 is so good I want more, it's so cheap I can afford more, and small enough that I can eat more, so  get a #8. I talk to Mr. Le about his bread and the finer points of rice flour vs. high gluten, then I notice he walks across the hall to the Chinese place and has his lunch delivered.

I may try that next time..."}
{"text":"Best bahn mi sandwich s ever. My husband loves their freshly squeezed sugar cane drink its so refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm. Banh Mi. Not much else needs to be said but I'll say it anyway. The sandwiches are amazing and very fresh (not to mention great price). This place is tiny but clean, with only a sprinkling of tables if you plan on eating in. Don't forget to bring cash and do keep in mind that they close up sometimes for weeks at a time as it's a mom and pop so if they're on holiday it's not open. All that really doesn't matter because this is excellent banh mi so it's still 5 stars."}
{"text":"$4 buys you the most delicious sandwich you can imagine! 

Everything that the others rave about is TRUE. The baguettes here are chewy and fresh, the meat is savory, the vegetables are crispy and bright. These things combine to make a tasty treat that is simply sublime.

About once a week, someone at the office has a craving . . . we dispatch a volunteer and spend the afternoon rejoicing over the experience.  I just returned as an envoy to what I affectionally refer to as \"Little Saigon\" with eleven #6s, 3 with peppers. ;) 

Nomnomnomnomnomnomnom!"}
{"text":"On vacation with my parents looking for a good Bahn Mi to eat. Definitely, this is the place. Location extremely run down and kind of scary. Go in the daytime, would not recommend night time. The cafe is inside the mall. Next, to the cafe is a bunch of Asian stores. As you walk in you will immediately see it. Not much to look at. But, has very good Bahn Mi. Owner really nice gentlemen. Now, the Bahn Mi, bread was extremely good. Crust just right, and soft. The Bahn Mi, was $4 under. I ordered the grill pork, topped with cilantro, carrots, daikon and some jalapeno peppers for a kick. Delicious!! I have tasted a lot of Bahn Mi, from Columbus, Chicago, LA, Houston, Toronto, and Boston. Hands down this place is really good. Great Bahn Mi!! Good Vietnamese ice or hot coffee too!! If, you can overlook the location and run down mall. Just run in quickly and get your Bahn Mi and ice coffee and run out."}
{"text":"If you like adventure and a great Banh Mi and want to be assured of a bargain: Go!  

The adventure is in getting there.  Stage one is the parking lot.  You may need to get your alignment checked later.  Once you get close enough to park, you gotta find it.  There's not much signage. You need to know where you're going. Don't turn around it's really there. I went in through the entrance next to the grocery.  You will wonder if the surrounding businesses are open.  Keep walking.  A few steps in you wonder if the a/c is working.  It's the south, it's supposed to be hot.  Stay cool, don't gawk.  You start to think this kinda looks like a movie set.  Legitimate businesses (food establishments no less) can't really be functioning in here.  Ignore what looks like used to be fountains or decor. Ambiance that's all it is.

The menu is brief.  You know why you're here.  Service is friendly and welcoming as well as informative.  It is also quick.  By the time you get over the sticker shock, you know those have to be retro prices. Your order is ready.  I must admit I spent way too much time thinking of the sardine sandwich I didn't get.  I got the 2 #7s one spicy. Don't try it if you don't think a certain amount of pain is necessary to enjoy good food.  You'll will devour half of it before you realize you're consuming a whole jalapeno.  The combination of pickled vegs and fresh cilantro lull you into a false sense of security.  The bread is perfectly crisp and then soft and yielding.  By the time you feel the heat effusing down your throat and warming your face, you are done.  

You feel like you've accomplished something just getting there.  The sandwiches assure you that it was worth it.  A GREAT spot.   Everything you probably heard about this place is likely true.  You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Every time I go buy groceries at Asian Corner Mall I try to remember to take some cash with me so that I can stop by and purchase some Bahn Mi sandwiches from this place. I always get the special combination sandwich w/ the veggies on the side. My family is a fan of their sandwiches and I also like to purchase the bubble teas from here. The sandwiches are very decently price and they are super fast. The only downfall is that they take cash only so make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"Hands-down they have the best sandwiches and Charlotte - if you call yourself a foodie you have to try it"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I love Vietnamese food, I'm passionate about fresh baguettes, and after reading the glowing reviews here I made my way to Le's Sandwich Shop anticipating a real treat.

First of all, the semi-abandoned, shady-looking mall smells faintly of urine and stale fish sauce, and has dodgy-looking men standing in dark corners.  If you enter and exit the center entrance, you'll at least miss most of that experience.  Careful you don't lose a wheel in the war-torn parking lot (which is easily as bad as the worst parking lot in which you've ever driven).  

Then the bread everyone raves about, and refers to as a baguette.  It's not a baguette except by the most Sarah Lee white-bread pre-frozen definition of a sandwich roll.  This is NOT a French baguette by any stretch of the imagination, and it doesn't resemble any mini-baguette you'll find at a good Vietnamese French bakery.  It's soft, no-crust white bread and almost tasteless.  

The Vietnamese sandwich ingredients aren't bad, and the sandwiches are cheap, but that's the best I can say for the experience.  The bread rolls were 75 cents.  Bread is half the experience (at least) of a good sandwich, and this bread isn't worth the wheat.

Makes me wonder about you Charlotteans and your French bread experience.  Is there any place in Charlotte to buy a good baguette or bátard that's actually fresh-baked, rather than frozen and thawed?  I want sourdough and crunchy crust, people."}
{"text":"Oh Banh Ti, how I have missed you!
Cute mom and pop sandwich shop with some homemade goodies on display, tables, so it does not feel like a mini-market.
Located in a semi-derelict Asian mall which I hope does not close.  Rap/Hip Hop stores also here.  And a few homeless people."}
{"text":"Honestly we don't know of any other places that sell them, so this is always our go-to place when we crave Vietnamese sandwiches, even though it is a long drive for us.  They haven't disappointed us yet.  The parking lot is in terrible shape and there's nothing else worthwhile in this empty \"mall\", but despite that there always seem to be a constant stream of customers in this sandwich shop.  That should tell you how much people like them."}
{"text":"Everyone says order the number 6 and they're right. $3.50 gets you an amazing sandwich in an interesting location and I'm sure a few stories to tell.

Be careful because the other review are correct in saying this sandwich can be spicy. We've eaten here twice, the most recent we had a much better experience with more care taken to deseed the peppers. However the first time we at there both of us were pretty  uncomfortable for about a half hour after eating with our mouths on fire.

A must go experience, don't let the outward appearance of the mall foul you."}
{"text":"I may sound petty but I hate getting ripped off or tricked. We bought 2 sandwiches (3.75 each) which should be $7.50 and assuming with tax, it should be not a dollar more in taxes. However my total came out to $8.62. The man doesn't give out receipts and do not take credit cards meaning IRS can't track how much he really makes. Unless taxes are 15% in Charlotte, I don't know how it came out to that much. Usually I would buy 5 or 6 so I don't really pay much attention but this time, I was really able to calculate. If the sandwich is $4 and not $3.75, he needs to stop being shady and update his signage. The man is rich. Cash only is shady business. No receipt for customers to see break down of your purchase. Super shady."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something amazing.. Stop here! I love #6 & #7. I can't get enough of this place! They also sell homemade beef jerky that I enjoy! P.S They don't accept credit cards.."}
{"text":"My wife and I rushed from work to experience what Le Sandwiches has to offer. They close promptly at 6pm. And I mean at 6pm!! But, it was well worth it! I'm driving and eating at the same time because it was sooo good!! Finding it was a problem at first because it looked like Apocalypse Now movie set!! But don't be discouraged!! Hold tight because your taste buds are gonna love it!! By the way!!! Make sure you have good shocks and struts because the parking lot has more craters than the the Moon!"}
{"text":"Word on the street was snag the no. 6, so I went in blind and asked for the 6. The shop itself is in a dilapidated, post-hurricane-looking, disaster stricken strip mall. It's certainly an adventure, especially if you pay attention to sanitation scores...

Absolute gem. Delicious friggin sangwich."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for the Sandwiches and total experience.  Once you get here and see the location you'll realize how good the Sandwiches are.  

Don't take your mother in law.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love love love. Their location is sketchy since it's inside Asian Corner but they literally have THE BEST BANH MAI in Charlotte NC. Don't judge this place. I've been coming here since I was 7 years old. It is also family owned. Best recommend to anyone looking for a great Banh Mi."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! We grabbed the #6 and took it to a nearby watering hole. It was perfect for a little picnic, but watch out for the jalapenos! (We visit the grocery store regularly so were not surprised by the ambiance of the parking lot / shopping center.)"}

Don't let the parking lot and occasional hobo's scare you away.

Cash only"}
{"text":"The restaurant gets a lot of hype on yelp and other news so I decide to check it out.

It is in the sketchy part of town and there is no sign on the exterior of the mall so it was a little difficult to find. The service as great and the people were really nice.

The food was good, not great but for the price it wasn't bad. I want to go back and check out the rest of the asian mall when the gf isn't with me. I enjoy sketchy places more than she does I guess."}
{"text":"Both husband and wife owners are very stuck up.  They treat customers like sh*t.  They would arbitrarily charge taxes whoever they like and not charge some others at their discretion. When I confronted them they said they are the owners and they can chose to charge taxes or not at their discretion. So stupid."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here on a drive south to Atlanta. Easy to get to from off the highway location wise... Everyone else is right, the Asian mall it's in is straight outta the Walking Dead. However, Le's is well worth it and it's very clean inside. People couldn't be nicer. 

The sandwich though! We got the #6 grilled pork. Amazing. They do everything right. Jalapeños were very hot and my lips burned for a while after but it was well worth it. I'll make it a regular stop from now on... So delicious."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi sandwich I've ever had! As fresh and authentic as it gets!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The BBQ pork and pâté sandwiches were so good. Can't wait to go back. Take cash, though."}
{"text":"I actually love this place to the max! I just love the warm welcome that he gives you and he has a polite attitude while serving his sandwiches! This place deserves more than 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches for a great price. No fuss in ordering your sandwich and a good variety with a nice crispy baguette."}
{"text":"Well.... what else is there to say that hasn't already been said:

- Man behind the counter: friendly
- Banh Mi: awesome

Let me bring one thing to your attention. This sandwich is HOT. omg I did not know  this sandwich was going to be so hot. my mouth was burning for I dont know how long. It is a very good sandwich with out the HEAT. PLEASE be aware. Im sure there are others that didnt know it was so hot. I noticed that the Hotness was coming from the bell peppers they put on there.."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great-- as are the prices.  The fact that so many reviews here comment on the \"post-apocalyptic\" setting shows the lamentable suburban Charlotte mindset that everything needs to be tidy, safe, and predictable.  This is why Chalotte is such a poster child for chain restaurants, conformity, and lack of creativity.  This mall is a good look into the 3rd world, and has nothing to fear.  The cheap real estate is a blessing that attracts unique restaurants, shops and wonderful ethnic diversity.  

In other cities, there would be a thriving artist scene in this area with galleries, music venues, etc. and would be rushing for gentrification. Then the $4 sandwich would be $9.95 like in Ballantyne, Huntersville, etc.  I've been going to this mall for years, mainly to shop the amazing Asian-African food markets.  It's a wonderful cultural island-- and I hope it stays this way, including potholes... to keep out the moneyed riff-raff."}
{"text":"The menu might be 91% meat based but that 1 veggie sand which was spicy and a good value...one hidden gem of Asian cuisine hidden in a terribly outdated building.  The beverages available were mostly healthy if that makes a difference!"}
{"text":"The best value for lunch in Charlotte. I crave *this* bahn mi and am never disappointed.  Shopping center/parking lot comments, sure. This shop is impeccably clean and an oasis in the middle of all of the chaos but...wow. Forever consistant and delicious"}
{"text":"The baguette, freshly baked, is the greatest gift the French left Vietnam after colonial rule, back when they referred to the peninsula as French Indochina.  Little did the French know that the locals would convert a colonial relic, perhaps an unhappy reminder of a time where the people on the peninsula were subjugated, into something delicious and beautiful by combining the baguette and pate from the French with typical local ingredients.

I'm of course referring to the Vietnamese sandwich known as banh mi, aka \"The People's Sandwich\" (my own term) but then again most people reading this review are familiar.  Or at least you should be, because if you aren't, as far as I'm concerned you are missing out on an epicurean delight that is worth seeking out.  As is the case with a lot of food from local immigrant communities, those who dig around are the ones who are richly rewarded.  Which brings me to Le's Sandwiches.

As has been documented by other Yelpers, Le's is located within an Asian pedestrian mall that you might suspect is effectively abandoned. Walking into the mall you quickly realize that this is basically the case at Asian Corners.  You would never suspect that this place houses a small restaurant that serves wonderful banh mi.  

Forget the \"sketchy\" aspect - this is normal and real life for a lot of people, especially within immigrant communities.  Put the suburban, culturally sanitized perspective aside and realize that dining out as we know it is a culinary anomaly in the larger context of things.  In other words, man/woman the hell up and just go get your damn sandwich, capisce? You won't regret this trip and I bet you'll be slinking back, maybe with a friend who hasn't tried a Vietnamese sandwich before. I would if I lived in Charlotte.

Tonight I had the grilled pork banh mi. I don't have words for the experience of a warm baguette in your hands filled with meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, etc.  The combinations available to you with banh mi can be foreign; however, what will not be foreign to you is the taste of home that you get.  You quickly understand that this is comfort food from a culture on the other side of the world.  This is why seeking out food like this is so addicting to me - I'm obsessed with learning about cultures through food.

The sandwiches are very good, friggin' cheap and the service is friendly (this is a mom and pop sandwich shop - mom made my sandwich today!).  It may be possible to find banh mi elsewhere in Charlotte, but as an out-of-towner who is only passing through, I would urge you to consider taking this food field trip.  It's a mile from Smelly Cat, you greasy hipsters!

For the banh mi and a drink - $4.92 after tax.  Take a guess what I think Mickey D's can do with their value meal!

Cinco estrellas.  I'm a fan but if I lived in Charlotte I'd be a superfan. There would be a Le family portrait with me superimposed within.

TIP: The drink case.   When in doubt reach for a can of the lychee and get your drink on.  It's pleasant and sweet, a nice refresher against the pepper in the banh mi you are inhaling/eating.  Don't forget to shake first.  Your booty then the can. =P"}
{"text":"We were a little apprehensive about actually going inside the mall once we navigated what has to be the worst kept parking lot I've ever seen, but darn we were glad we did. The owner (I assume) was super nice and guided us to the #6 pork sandwich. Absolutely amazing sandwich and it was less than $5. I'll probably order two next time. Highly recommended and I will be going here at least three times a month."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town hands down. You have to try the sugar cane juice. Very refreshing. The sandwiches are big and very tasty. The vegetables are fresh and not soggy. We're about an hour away but worth the drive. Location isn't all that great but ignore the surroundings and go for the customer service and food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  What a hidden gem!  The sandwich was fantastic!   GREAT prices, GREAT food, GREAT service!  I will be back this coming week for more!  Thanks for being here!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this hidden restaurant. You can't judge this place by appearances-we were pretty skeptical going into the mall, considering its full of boarded up shops and is eerily quiet. Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted by Le himself with a smile on his face. Very friendly guy offering up some delicious grub. Highly recommend a try for both food and experience."}
{"text":"Bahn mi sandwiches are one of my favorite foods on the planet. When I lived in Boston, I'd go downstairs and choose from one of the many hole-in-the-wall bahn mi shops and pick up a smoky grilled meat, crispy warm bread, tangy spicy veggie mixed sandwich for about $2. 

Le's isn't quite that magical, but as my friend Jen says... is the best option you can get in Charlotte. 

I honestly don't suggest going after the sun goes down. I think it's kind of scary in the daytime actually.  Th strip mall it's located in features several unsavory looking home-grown carwashing operations.  Ignore them.  Ignore the chipped, cracked asphalt. Put on your best \"I'm a badass foodie\" face and strut into the strip mall.  Nobody should bother you.

The sandwich board features all the options, ranging from the cold cut variety or sandwich to grilled chicken and pork, etc. They're cheap (about $3, $3.50ish) and come in a long paper bag for easy transport.  You'll find some folks order a dozen at a time and sometimes there's a line.  It's a popular place. 

The sandwich is good.  It really hits the spot when the bahn mi craving hits.  However...there's no juiciness, so the sandwich is a tad drier than I'm used to.  However, there is plenty of veggie goodness in each sandwich, so the overall balance is good. 

Check it out if you're in the area, or craving something cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"The closer I got to Le's, the more and more Roland's voice sounded like Colonel Kurtz from \"Apocalypse Now.\"  Time slowed down a bit, and my senses heightened.  I found myself deeply inhaling through my nostrils for the smell of napalm.  

We arrived sans metal detector and traversed through the parking lot minefield unscathed nonetheless.  Instead of eyeballing for the entrance to the barracks, my eyes scanned for enemy combatants until my compatriot lauded the \"all clear.\"

No guards, no signs...this must be the place.  We knew the praise for Le's must be the real deal Holyfield.

This is one of those locations that you had no issue traipsing around and adventuring to before marriage and kids.  Now you're appraising the vehicle you're driving and wondering if your life insurance is up to date.  Just kidding...or am I?  This is the \"used to be the used to be the sorta strange but kinda okay\" mall.  

\"First time?\"  \"We look THAT green, eh?\"  Number 6 with peppers it is.

When I finally got off the floor, I did the, \"this is soooo freaking good\" head nod...to have it reciprocated.  I was not expecting what I saw on the sign...or in the basket...to taste that good!  Even the aftermath belches taste great (yea...I said it...don't judge me)!

The sandwich was a marinated pork, pickled veggies, and fresh jalapenos on a....

Let's talk about the bread here. Do you remember the Kid and Play movie, \"House Party?\"  No?  Me neither.

Moving on then...

No...but really, the dance-off part of that movie.  The bread that this sandwich is made on makes me want to do that entire scene.  Ankle grabbed, hand behind head...and wildly flailing my leg back and forth.  I also feel an intense urge to bust out some old metal band front kicks while putting up the horns and yelling, \"Slayer!\" How those two things go together, you'll never know...since I just chalk it up to being strange. Trust me, it's me...not you.

Is it possible that my first experience has made me an addict?  I want this for dinner now too.  Can I buy a couple of these and stick them in the fridge...or do I need to man-up and deploy again?

{"text":"A friend recommended Le's, and man, am I glad she did! Delicious grilled pork banh mi and friendly, welcoming, kind service. The location and shopping center itself is kind of run-down, but this sandwich shop is truly great and offers a nice experience. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"They do a really good job here at making banh mi. I've had banh mi from Cali and Chicago so i understand the art of a good banh mi. I had the special and they asked if I wanted to keep the pickling separate until I'm ready to eat it at home. That's really thoughtful because when I got home, I toasted the banh mi in the toaster oven for a few minutes to get that extra cruch factor and then added the pickling. The meat was delicious and the pickling was just perfect. The length of the bread alone was more than I expected. I'm glad that there is a good banh mi place in Charlotte. Can't wait to try other items on the menu."}

I was longing for a good banh mi and ordered the #6 without peppers.  It was fresh, fast, and the prices are amazing!  It makes walking through the old, unairconditioned mall, where shadows lurk and seedy characters are around the corner worth it!  This place is a complete gem.  Inside the restaurant it was spotless!  Where else in Charlotte can you buy 4 delicious sandwiches plus 2 canned drinks for $17 and change?  Nowhere and I'll be back again for my banh mi fix and with the money I save, maybe I'll splurge on a bodyguard ; )."}
{"text":"The. best. banh. mi. 

You get an authentic third world country experience when you come here. From the deplorable parking lot, to the grim \"mall\" inside.

I really hope it's beef."}

{"text":"The BAD:
Drive slow, the parking lot is like a mine field of car swallowing pot holes. You will want to turn around when you get to the parking lot. You will question why you're even thinking of eating here. You will be lost because there are no signs on the outside, follow the signs for the food and go to the store fronts pictured in the yelp photos.

The GOOD:
THE FOOD and the friendly man taking your order! The place is very clean even though the strip mall around it is falling apart. I hear the jerky sold there is good, haven't tried it yet.

Order the chicken #2 and the grilled pork #6, one will fill you up but you will want more later. Also pick up a fresh squeezed sugar cane juice (with a touch of orange), or maybe 2 because I finished mine on the way to the car.

There are tables to eat at but I suggest take-out."}
{"text":"Like so many reviewers have already mentioned, I also like the pork #6. My next choice is the special combination (#7). The best Bhan Mi I've found so far. Also try their ice drink/dessert in the cups in the fridge, they are very good especially if you like coconut milk base drinks, but not many reviews mentioned about this. Unfortunately the pot holes that has been there for years never got fixed."}
{"text":"\"This looks like a post apocolyptic world\"- My husband as we were driving up to the shopping center to check out Le's.

I have heard great things about this place and it has been on my bucket list for a while now. This past Friday, my husband and I checked it out for lunch. The parking lot is a big old mess. Literally, would have never found this place if it wasn't for Yelp. However, I have always been taught to not judge a book by it's cover. Totally true for Le's!

To get inside, you have to literally go inside the shopping center and it will pop up on the right. As we walked in and started reading the menu, it was obvious that we were lost. The cashier immediately asked if we have eaten at Le's before. After saying no, he gave us a tour of the menu and recommendations, which was great!

We decided on the #6 (most popular thing ordered)- Pork Bahn Mi and the #8 BBQ Pork. Both sandiwches were nice sizes. Total bill $8.......$4 a sandwich!!! Just as a FYI, it is cash only. 

Both sandwiches were delish. The pickled carrots, cilantro, and jalapenos were perfect toppings. I think both of us prefered the Bahn Mi slightly over the BBQ Pork.

Thanks Yelp for helping me find this place"}
{"text":"Spicy, fresh, and delicious pork sandwich. Le, the owner, is super friendly and knows how to treat customers well. Great value too."}
{"text":"Best banh mi sandwich I've ever eaten so far.. I get usually 5 or 6 to go and if I am in Charlotte, I make sure its a stop there and Amelie french bakery."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this place and they were on Thrillest.com, I had to come try it out for myself. I'm from the Central PA and we have many banh mi spots here. Le's banh mi tasted just like home and it was perfect. I had the #1 and a taro bubble tea. The place was sketchy and I didn't realize that the little shop was inside. I'm definitely getting more when I come back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"The banh mi sandwiches are delicious!  And at great prices!  (Cash Only)  However, the plaza is pretty barren so I recommend you get in, and get out."}
{"text":"Tricky to find but bomb sandwiches!!! The #6 is a great sandwich to start your first experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to spots. You literally can not go wrong with Le's. I have been here well-over a dozen times and have NEVER had a bad experience. I've even recruited several people who are now die-hard fans of Le's. If you are looking for a delicious banh mi then this is your place. The freshness of the ingredients and crunchy deliciousness of the bread are unmatched. I know that other places claim to have banh mis that are good but to me they just aren't as simple and delicious as what Le's offers. Let me also point out...Le's Sandwiches are a proven hangover cure in my opinion! All for less than $4!

To be fair I can not comment on anything other than #6 (the grilled pork banh mi). Don't blame me though, I found what I liked and stuck with it! There are several sandwiches though to suit the pallet of any banh mi fan; I simply prefer the classic.

One could not write a review about Le's Sandwiches without commenting on the ambience. Le's Sandwiches is certainly off the beaten path and is tucked away in the Asian Mall off of N Tryon which at times looks like it was abandoned in the late 70's. Don't let the scenery fool you though. Le's Sandwiches is impeccably clean and well-kept. After enjoying a sandwich at Le's be sure to check out one of the Asian markets in the same area. Great stuff and one of the cheapest places I've found Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce!"}
{"text":"I was on a road trip through Charlotte and we wanted a sandwich. Online reviews led us here. I seek out hole in the walls and love a delicious spot in a weird place. The boba tea was very good but the sandwich was not impressive, if this is the #1 sandwich shop in Charlotte I'm sorry for their other spots. It wasn't bad but wasn't good as many others I've had. Sandwich wasn't cut in half which was weird, and seemed to be making up for lack of meat by over stuffing carrots. Still for the price is was alright but I wouldn't rave about this place. Mostly it was the over hyped reviews I'm disappointed in."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches in town?  Not hardly.   Not that bad for luncmeat on a baguette, and the price is right for what you get but what you get is not much. No drinks, small sandwiches, no sides and no seating. 

if you are in the neighborhood, and by that I mean already parked and out of your car, fine go there. Definitely not something you drive to."}
{"text":"Pros: Cheap $3 sandwiches ( they are small, so don't expect a Subway-type sandwich). Tasty.

Cons: Ghetto strip mall, takes cash only, no AC in summer"}
{"text":"This place is definitely the best banh mi I've found in CLT...although it's very dodgy trying to get there - but well worth it.  I think they get their bread fresh, which is essential - I'm basing my opinion on my experiences with Lee's Sandwiches found on the west coast - pretty much a staple."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Perfectly crispy and airy baguette with a balanced and wonderful mix of ingredients. For Bahn Mi, this place is tops over any other place in the US (and Cali Vietnamese sandwich shops are pretty phenomenal so making this statement means this place is amazing!) love the place. Hard to find and in a odd part of this strip mall, but totally worth finding!!!!"}
{"text":"Le's, where do I start? I remember my first trip here. My girlfriend and I judged based on appearance from the outside of the mall to the inside but we wrong for that. This is our go to sandwich shop. We have had every sandwich but the sardine and they are all great. They make their baguette bread in house  with a perfect crisp. We really love the combination with pork, the grilled pork, and the meatball  banh mis the most. The grilled pork with the sauce jalepnos and pickled daikon and carrots, and cilantro is perfect every time. I have never been disappointed with this place and will alway be a regular. If you have not tried this place and lime banh mis you have to go to Le's."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Le's.  Loved the entire experience of driving to a decrepit mall in the middle of nowhere to taste the best sandwich I've ever tried.  Le's offers a vegetarian option with soy meat.  Typically, I don't like soy meat and op just for veggies, but this one was so well done, it added to the sandwich.  The bread was also fabulous.  I don't know if he makes it or is just able to find bread like that, but it made the sandwich."}
{"text":"Foot long Viet sub for less than $4!  Awesome!  I love the sugar can drink too.  The Vietnamese coffee is not the best Vietnamese coffee that I've drank but I'll still order it.  As for the bubble tea, I had better bubble tea in the CLT area.  I actually prefer the bubble tea from Truc and that one place located on Boardwalk."}
{"text":"Screw Subway's \"Februany\" Footlong for Five Dollars.  Come to Le's and get a delicious Vietnamese footlong for only $3.50.  You can get one slightly smaller for only $3.

This place is truly a hole in the wall.  Le's is tucked away inside a Chinese strip mall that has a parking lot with more potholes than parking spots.  Le's is so obscure, I couldn't even see a sign for it on the outside of the strip mall.  It was only once I explored around inside the \"Chinese Food Court\" that I found it.

The sandwiches are legit.  Well seasoned pork, nicely cooked vegetables, a crispy soft warm baguette, and super cheap!


And if you want, you can pick up a cuttlefish for the road, which they neatly sell packaged in zip-lock bags.  I love it."}
{"text":"Very good vietmanese sandwiches! Good price for a good sized sandwich, I had the grilled pork one. The only downside is the location and all the potholes in the parking lot. Worth the effort though."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Vietnamese foods. I heard about this Banh Mi place. I went there twice, once last week and once this week. I ordered the pork and sardine sandwich in our first visit. The taste was okay, but not as good as those people described. There was not much sardine in the sandwich. We ordered the sardine once again on our second visit. It's better this time. More sardine this time. I guess the price is the big selling point. $4 a sandwich. What can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Just go and eat all the things.  Don't forget cash only! I always do veggie sans jalapeños at lunch and get two and save one for dinner!  So delicious!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Got a couple #1s(reg ham combo) and a couple #8s(bbq pork). The pork was alright but flavor and taste of the reg Ham combo was surprisingly delicious. The rest around the area cannot compare to it. I haven't had one that good in a while. 4.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Le's bahn mi is incredible.  The staff is always friendly and fast and the sandwiches are to die for!  So fresh and flavorful!  The prices are so reasonable.  I only wish they were in a more convenient location.  They are in the back of a strip mall with a parking lot riddled with potholes so it's always a challenge to get in and out, yet when all is said and done, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The best Banh Mi I have ever had. This place -- though in a kind of broken down strip mall -- is incredibly clean and organized. The Banh Mi is a great price and is incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and great!

I can't believe I have not reviewed this place before.  I go there all the time.

First of all, it isn't easy to find.  You have to go to the Asian mall at the corner of sugar creek in Tryon.  The parking lot is rough, I mean ROUGH!  Pot holes everywhere, some mangled speed bumps as well.  The mall looks pretty ghetto too, but I don't know of any crime there.  Once you drive by all the stores you'll probably notice a pho place, a few grocery stores, and some nail salons, but no banh mi.  You actually have to go up in this run down mall.  The best entrance is towards the end away from Tryon.  Go in about a hundred feet and you'll see Le's on the right.

Its sooooo good.  There\"s an easy to identify menu with numbers.  Always ask for it on a baguette, its like 50-75 cents more but you get a whole lot more food.  I suggest trying them all, but I normally go for the combo or the pate.  Pay the extra little bit for pate regardless of which sandwich, it makes it.  The pickled veggies are extremely crunchy but watch out, sometimes there is an extra large chunk of hot pepper in there.

They have bubble tea, some Gatorade and a couple other offerings as far as drinks go.  There\"s a few small tables, but I normally take mine to go.

Not really that much else to say, just go, you won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"I'm biased about this place just because we have been eating sandwiches from here since I was born. This store is timeless and the sandwich (#1 on the menu; banh mi thit nguoi) is a classic. I honestly don't think I've had better banh mi than this place nor will I really ever crave any from anywhere else! We live an hour away, so every time we go we stack up on sandwiches."}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you to Pourina R., Ben G., and Chad E. for telling me about amazing sandwich shop. Not only do they have amazing Vietnamese sandwiches, but they are some of the best sandwiches I have ever had.

Yes the shop may not be in the nicest place...you will need to find your own path to drive through in the parking lot, and the inside of the building is dirty and rundown. But, it does not hurt the experience of this restaurant at all.

We tried the #6 and #7. The number #6 is there grilled pork banh mi. We added pate to it and it did not disappoint. It was likely the most flavorful out of the two. It was also the spiciest. The #7 is there combination special which comes with multiple types of pork. It was a great sandwich but not as good as the #6. Both sandwiches came on a long baguette roll and topped with cucumbers, pickled vegetables, and fresh herbs. We washed down the sandwiches with their fresh squeezed sugar cane juice. It was the first time I had sugar cane. I really enjoyed it. The juice was not overly sweet and super refreshing.

 After we ate our sandwiches, I was very tempted to order two other sandwiches to bring home for dinner. I promise you it is that good. 

Oh, did I mention that these tasty, flavorful sandwiches cost less than $4 a sandwich...Seriously? How is that even possible?"}
{"text":"There's not much about Le's that hasn't already been said... Tucked away in the Asian corner mall with potholes bigger than my Toyota, Le's is an absolute gem that I take all my friends to when we want exceptional food at great prices. My only reason for 4 stars is that the pickled veggies are a bit too spicy sometimes, but the bread is always fresh, the portions consistent, and the overall quality is excellent. Don't let the location scare you off from venturing inside, everyone is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"So far, the best and most consistent Banh Mi in Charlotte; yes it is worth the 45 minute drive when there's no traffic. 

Not much more to say but if you know Banh Mithen  go here and get yourself some. If you're not familiar with Banh Mi then go here and try a great sandwich experience (and you're welcome!)."}
{"text":"The best banh mi dac biet I've ever tasted. It beats banh mi in Atlanta & Lee's sandwich in California & Las Vegas! So I heard they order their meat from California & they make their banh mi fresh there at the place. Everything tastes perfect! I live in South Carolina & always make the drive to Charlotte to order banh mi to go. A little expensive when you order 10 of them but it's definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"Le's is such an awesome adventure.  Dodge the pot holes, brave the elements of the creepy Asian mall and score the most highly regarded Bahn Mi sandwich in the city.  My order is always the #6 grilled pork, extra meat, add pâté and it never disappoints.  I also like to throw a little Sriracha on top back at the house for an extra kick!"}
{"text":"So, I've been putting this review off for a while, upset that I did not have the amazing experience like everyone else. I hate that I hated this place, but that's the way it is. 

Getting here was an absolute mess. I have never been to the part of town before and was scared, even in the safety of my car. The inside was no better. It looks like a post-apocololytpic, abandoned, east Detroit strip mall with garbage on the floors and graffiti on the walls.

Le's isn't much better, but appeared to be clean and I was hungry so I stepped up to the plate and ordered the combo and grilled pork sanwhiches. Some nice guy in front of me tossed the cashier some extra money and paid for my sandwiches...really nice and a much needed spirit boost after my tumultuous ride in.

So, I have had some very good Bahn Mi sandwiches before and these were no better. The meat just tasted...old. The best part were the baguettes, which I have to admit, were pretty good.

So then, I bite into something with a gummy, rubbery texture and bright pink (see picture). Perhaps, this is supposed to be in the sandwich (somebody please tell me if this is the case) but it absolutely disgusted me and I wound up throwing out the rest of both sandwiches.

In short, this place is way to far off the beaten path and frankly, in a dangerous area. Save yourself the time and stress and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried the pork banh mi and it was great. The bread, pickled daikon/carrots, pork, cilantro, jalapeno were all fresh and it was only around $4. I should have gotten two! No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed this place before? Whether I am going to IKEA, to Charlotte, or just passing by, I always stop to grab a Bahn mi sandwich here.

Don't let the post-apocalyptic look of the mall discourage you. On the inside the restaurant is spic-n-span. Sanitation rating of 98.5. (Can't say as much for the mall bathroom - go before you arrive.)

They offer 10 varieties of sandwiches.  I always get the pork, with a slight preference for the grilled (#6) over the barbecue (#8).

The key to Bahn mi is the bread and the contrasts - sweet, savory, acidic, tender, crunchy. Le's does all that very well.

One warning: the sandwiches come with raw peppers. If you can't handle spicy, ask for without."}
{"text":"The Bahn Mi is excellent. I've eaten Bahn Mi across the Gulf Coast Vietnamese diaspora and Le's is now in my top three. The bread and pork were on point. Plus, they're a fantastic deal!"}
{"text":"Le's is the best lunch spot in Charlotte. The #6 is my favorite but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. I also love the fresh pressed sugar cane juice."}
{"text":"If you can look past the buildings outward appearance you will find some fantastic food. Got the number six, grilled pork. It was tender and juicy, and there was a nice bite to the sandwich from the fresh jalapenos. Paired it with a honeydew bubble tea which was also excellent. Great food and inexpensive too. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Simple and perfect. 

Try not to be intimidated by the location and the mall that you enter as you find your way to Le's. The food is legit AF. I had a pork bahn mi and a tarro bubble tea, I was in my happy place. The sandwiches are dirt cheap, most are $4.25. Get one for now and one for later if you know good food. The tarro bubble tea was also really good and the tarro flavor is hard to find. The seating is super limited so if it's a date night plan on a picnic. The guy at the counter was welcoming and explained everything you would need to know if you are new to this. 

Fast and fresh; don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches! And got to have sugarcane juice lol. Also, the fresh beef jerky is good :)"}
{"text":"Once in a while, I make my way up to Sugar Creek to eat at Le's Sandwiches. Eating here brings back great memories. When I was little, I would hold my mom's hand as we ponder through the Asian grocery store in front of Le's. I always look forward to what happens after grocery shopping. YES, you guessed it-BANH MI (Vietnamese sandwiches)... and freshly made SUGARCANE JUICE!! I haven't been back here in years and now as I sit, sipping on my sugarcane, people watching and yelping away, I notice the crowd that this tiny, hidden gem has drawn over the years. The line has been never-ending since we've gotten here! If you haven't ventured to Le's, I ensure the journey is worth it. Try #1-Combination. I'm not really sure what combination meat entails, but it essentially doesn't matter. The grilled pork banh mi is also one of my favorites. No matter which one you land on.. get the long bread, tell them to add butter, have it toasted and eat it there -WITH Sugarcane juice. You're welcome :) 

If this isn't enough to convince you, my 90lbs mother just finished her entire sandwich and ordered one more. Yup that was definitely the last bite of the SECOND sandwich she just devoured. FYI: These are about foot long sandwiches -and for only $2.75-$4 each. Beat that, Subway!"}
{"text":"Bad customer services, my girlfriend order Thai tea with boba, she end up getting Thai tea with boba smoothie. We ask the owner to change it, he gave her attitude and said that's what she order and will not change it. Very low class customer services. We will not come back again."}
{"text":"I almost didn't find this place! I thought it was inside one of the super markets next to Asian Corner Mall and the offerings there looked disappointing. Once I walked into the mall And found Le's I was relieved that I had passed on the mistaken location. 

I ordered a #2 Grilled Chicken and a #6 Grilled Pork to split with my brother. My favorite was the pork due to the meat being more flavorful. The baguettes were toasted to crunchy perfection. I couldn't go without adding a few squirts of Sriracha to complete the experience.

The prices for the sandwiches are outstanding! $3.50, tops. 
Makes me sad that I'm only visiting Charlotte and I wish I could find something similar in Raleigh."}
{"text":"Every time I drive around Sugar Creek and Tryon, I think it is time to try Le's Sandwiches and I never stop.  Today I was craving Middle Eastern food, as much as I wanted tabouli, I decided today was the day for bahn mi from Le's. Yes, today is the day!

It is everything a foodie, eatee, adventure eater, tourist, you name it, it fills the void.  Off the beaten path- check, inexpensive -check, fresh ingredients 
-check, friendly service- check, in a shopping center that feels like it's abandoned - check.  A little sketchy, where you see all walks of life- check. 
A funnel cake vendor in the parking lot-check.  A group of car detailers in the parking lot- check.  A huge Asian market to stock the pantry -items that are a million dollars at Harris Teeter- check. 

Props to a simple menu, fresh ingedients, made with love and reasonably priced.  Le is the man."}
{"text":"Awesome food!

Le's Banh Mi is probably the best I've ever hard.  I've even experienced other places, but this one is the best.  

I always order the #1, but sometimes get the #7.  I love it that they make it in house, right in front of you and when you bite in... the crispy baguette crunch is the best.

Don't forget to wash it down with Yeo's Soy Bean Milk drink :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it up here. After living in Hawaii, I've never found a Bahn Mi sandwich that makes the grade!"}
{"text":"Equal parts adventure, experience, culinary safari, near scrapes with overtly life-threatening conditions for any vehicle, and personality. Goodness gracious. I've loved Banh Mi for years, but Le's has sparked a fire-y passion in my little Vietnamese cuisine-loving heart. 

Made it in on a Sunday afternoon, it was packed, and we were amongst tons of regulars. It was a great. My being green around the gills was easy to spot all the way from the cratered parking lot. 

Follow instructions on every other review you'll read here. Asian Corner, walk down the (awesomely dirty and strongly loved) hallway, hang a right, and get ready for a sandwich worth it's weight in gold. 

Now, there are tons of options. I wanted to swing for a grand slam of \"Wow! I've never even heard of that!\" but decided not to vie with au originale. #6 on a long baguette, please. It was....so good it rendered me speechless and with a face full of fantastically balanced Banh Mi. The bread.....my dear, sweet....it was perfect. So crunchycrispy, soft interior, slight chew. What kind of delicious sorcery made this bread?!?! Just absolutely perfect. The veggie combo -- standard pickle-y carrots, onions, and jalapenos. The pork. I've been missing out on this the entire time I've lived in Charlotte until now. One bite and you'll be a believer. (I've been told to call an audible and add paté to the #6. Next time: Done.) Oh, and much like the aforementioned, suckers are like $3 a pop. 

I'm a believer. Addict. Cheerleader. Wondrously and deliriously complete now that I've experienced Le's. If you're reading this, Owner/Management/Sandwich Artist, please accept my humble Thank You for all that you do."}
{"text":"If Disney World is the happiest place on earth than Asian Corners Shopping Plaza is hard in the running for the sketchiest place on earth. That being said, it is worth the trip to get one of Le's delicious bahn mi.

I went with the, seemingly bordering on iconic, #6 and for a mere $3.79 in coin of the realm I was given an unassuming white bag and sent on my merry way. Only when i got back to my office and dug in did i discover the perfectly crispy bread, sweet (but not too sweet) pork, crunchy veggies and fragrant cilantro. I really planned to save half for lunch tomorrow, I swear - plans change.

The food is absolutely 5 stars, and if you can get someone to go and pick it up for you you will have one of the most perfect lunches there is, but I have to take one star for location. I mean really, it is a s*%t hole. (And yes I'm sure that's why they are able to stay so cheap, but thems the breaks.)"}
{"text":"I love this place. very affordable and tasty. their menu caters to different tastes."}
{"text":"Insert comment about the terrible location and post apocalyptic parking lot. Insert another comment about the weird mall layout. Then insert the comment about the cleanliness of this place, insanely cheap price, and how awesome these sandwiches really are.

I definitely wouldn't have found this place if it wasn't for yelp. Now I make it a point to stop by any time I am in the area. While the Bahn Mi sandwich concept is a simple one, Le's crafts them to perfection. I prefer #6 (pork), which will set you back a whopping $4. Make sure to bring cash as they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place in Charlotte. Truly appreciate this establishment. Been coming here for years, and they make you feel like you're wanted. Their food is 100% consistent, and the service is remarkable. They exhibit how a place should be run. Great brigade system, and it's family owned. To watch a family work with each other, and well is refreshing. Tradition lives! Also, make sure to bring cash. No cards excepted, but it's always worth the trip here."}
{"text":"I don't understand the ratings. Let's be fair. This is not a good bahn mi restaurant at all.

First, for the banh mi itself , it is not impressive at all. I know at least two else places nearby that have much better banh mi (for example, bahn mi brothers).

Second, for the environment, it is located in a ruined plaza with destroyed parking lot. Once you find it, you will figure out that it does not have a maintained restroom. There is no place for you to wash your hands. Why do you want to wash your hands? Because they are cash only and your hands must touch the money before the banh mi.

Third, they charge for cup of water.

After all, I would think it illegal to open a restaurant without a place to be able to wash your hands. I don't know how I can report it to the  authorities. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you could describe Le's in a phrase, it's a pearl in an oyster. 

Le's is located in the Asian Corner shopping mall with some very rough parking. 

I get the #1 {Le's Combination} and the flavors of this sandwich are fantastic! Everything tastes perfectly balanced together. 

The best part about this place is the price. It's only $4 for the sandwich that I get! That's for a whole baguette!! I only get half of a sandwich for $7-8 in the triangle area!!! (Can you tell I'm excited?)

This place is great. Please go (make sure you bring cash, it's cash only)."}
{"text":"They do Vietnamese sandwiches and do them well. My favorites are #9 (fish/sardines) and #6 pork. They are all excellent and if they got any cheaper they would be paying you. The baguettes are long and full of good flavors; prices are about $3 to $4. To find it enter the \"mall\" by the Asian food supermarket and take a right. If you are put off by the run down \"mall\" it is in you should not call yourself a foodie."}
{"text":"Trek through the dilapidated mall to the most delicious sandwiches you'll find anywhere. Very clean and professional atmosphere. One sandwich is enough, but I usually get two since they're so great."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal in all aspects! I've watched the shopping area grow and die over the course of years and Le's is a hidden gem that I hope will continue to stay for the next many years. I grew up eating banh mi, whether it was for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack. I have never had a better sandwich at any other banh mi place than Le's. I love Banh Mi Thit Nguoi, it's one of my faves just because all the meats and everything compliments each other so well. They have plenty of small snacks on the side too in case you wanted to add a little something extra to your meal. The Sugarcane drink is delicious and very refreshing. The family is extremely nice and service is very quick. I wish they accepted cards too and not just cash! Maybe one day though, right?"}
{"text":"Simply the best Bahn Mi in Charlotte.  Hands down.  Nothing else really to say.  If you have not been here you are missing out.  Now as others have stated it is located in very strange looking old mall.  So overcome whatever fears you may have and go.  You will not be disappointed with the food.  A group of us from my office typically make a run to Le's once or twice a month and we would go more if it were closer.  Also if you like Asian cooking there is a little Asian grocery store that we usually stop and and restock on supplies.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"best banh mi place in charlotte. Just do it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are soooo delicious! My boyfriend and I found the place randomly on Yelp and immediately fell in love. We came back today and got four for our road trip! My favorite is the grilled pork baguette. Jalapeños add a nice spicy touch!"}
{"text":"This does not LOOK like a great place to eat but this is a real food gem find. Past the broken pavement and derelict buildings is a real treat. Le's pricing only enhances the experience - (I'm thinking they aren't wasting a lot of money on rent). It's all good, better to invest in top notch fresh ingredients and unique offerings. They hit the mark on both counts. Best strategy is to pick it up and go or do like me and eat in your car with the doors locked, of course.
See pictures above, I had a spicy pork Bahn Mi. It was warm bread with fresh cilantro and Asian heat on the inside lovingly wrapped around cool crisp vegetables and well seasoned pork. The warm texture of the bread really makes it such a treat. Just a perfect amount of crunch to the bread. I washed it down with something special...a freshly made (right in front of me) Sugar cane juice over ice. Sweeter than your first Kiss!
I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't know if ppl in charlotte have ever had bahn mi in other cities or not, but this was not a good experience. Bread is over toasted to make sure it's crispy, but that is it, not authentic. Avg ingredients. I've had bahn mi in many places and many cities. This was below avg. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. Bahn mi Saigon in Greensboro is worth trying if you have a chance bc they bake their own bread, but it's not here at Le's. This place is not worth it for me. I can do without ever coming back to this place. Please find another bahn mi elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love a good Bánh Mì, and As soon as I read the reviews for this place when scoping out Charlotte, I knew it was a legitimate heavy hitter.  Firstly because it's cheap.  I'm beginning to form my own rule of thumb that the cheapest Vietnamese restaurants are usually the best, just as is true for Taquerias, although strangely unrelated.  Secondly this place is tucked away in a semi abandoned, post apocalyptic-esque mall that has certainly seen better days.  Seriously, if you want to have a real life 1st person end of days experience take a stroll around this mall on your way to get a sandwich, it gets real.  True to form for my fantasies about the apocalypse, a Asian market, and a thriving Bánh Mì shop are among the retail establishments holdouts that have survived...thank God.  I could tell this place would be unique and unique is always my favorite flavor.  After visiting I can say Le's does not disappoint and should be on everyone's must try list who lives in or is visiting the Charlotte Area.
     Le's is not visible from the outside at all.  You wanna go to the far end of the mall parking lot, where most cars are likely parked, and enter where it says Dragon Court.  Head towards the dried up fountain and you will see it on your right.  A clean cut little shop enclosed in glass, it's impossible to miss as it's one of the only well kept storefronts in this derelict mall.  Almost immediately after walking in, the man behind the counter asked me if I knew what I wanted, and if it was my first time, I guess it was obvious.  I knew I was getting the #6 Grilled Pork Bánh Mì, which was further confirmed when he suggested trying it, although I'm sure this is the standard newbie/American go to sandwich.  The bread, which for me is basically the most important part of the Bánh Mì, was perfect here.  It has a thick crunchy crust but was still fluffy on the inside.  The grilled pork was not dry at all and had great flavor and texture.  All the veggies that come with the sandwich were in perfect proportion to balance the overall flavor.  Next time I'd probably get the #7, but I just can't pass on some good pork.  Vietnamese places do grilled Pork better than just about any other cuisine I know, and Le's grilled Pork is top notch, you just can't go wrong with it.
     I loved this place, I cannot think of anywhere else like it.  The dilapidated mall itself is worth checking out.  When I was there, a alarm was beeping incessantly, most store fronts were covered in brown paper, and/or fliers and posters, or filled with boxes...or shopping carts with random things in them.  Out of all this Le's stands out as some sort of delicious clean oasis that people constantly steam into and out of.  I'm always more concerned with the taste and execution of food than the atmosphere of a place.  Even though the atmosphere at the mall here is super sketchy and divey, I feel like that actually adds to how awesome Le's is.  On Top of the food being solid and the staff being super efficient and professional,  it's an experience to go here, and a experience just as memorable and exciting as the food is.  It's a true hidden gem, and visiting just makes you feel like your in on some incredible secret.  Fair warning though it does stay busy, seating is extremely limited, and it's cash only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"First of all, believe everyone when they said this place is sketchy..it is. The parking lot is horrible and the area is a little worn down. Not that I felt unsafe, but there was homeless people around including one guy talking to himself in he parking lot lol. Ok so this is like a Asian mini mall and you have to walk somewhat inside to find this place. The place itself is clean with a 98 score. 
I never had this type of food so I didn't know what to expect. I got the #1 combination since reviews said it was good along with a mango bubble tea(with gummies). 
The sandwich itself was for the most part good. I really didn't pay attention to what I was eating though. Nets started flying around us as we were eating so we decided to finish it in the car. Once in the car I examined what I was eating and had no idea!!! Lol. All the meat just looked gross and there was some type of mixture on the bottom of the sandwich that I couldn't make out. Now I love trying new and different types of food but it was a little weird and I ruined for myself and couldn't finish it.
I think I will go back and try something specific like the pork."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Always friendly and fast! 

Be warned about the parking lot attached to it, it's full of pot holes. My boyfriend and I literally have to plan which car to take if we're going."}
{"text":"Super shady parking lot and strip mall area but worth it for their Yummarama sandwiches. I always order 2 bahn mi sandwiches (I don't get down here often so I need my fix).  I get a #2 and #6 and they never disappoint. 

I was excited that pho ginseng restaurant (Vietnamese) opened in my area and just tried it for the first time. They had a bahn mi pork and chicken sandwich on their menu. I got the pork and it was fine but not even close to as good as le's."}
{"text":"This place was aight. This joint is like classic Bahn Mi. I can see how spots like Crispy Bahn Mi and Bahn Mi Brothers jazz up their sandwiches a bit more. I'm used to those flavors. 

The Pork was okay. I'm not used to woogly fat on my Pork so I wasn't feeling that and the chicken joint was okay. I could barely taste the mayo. My homie noticed the mayo on his sandwich towards the end of his second sandwich. Plus it looks like the mayo sauce was sitting out for a while. 

I added some siracha and hoisin sauce and it still made it just aight. Iono, it's not a spot I would come to again but I'm glad I tried it. 

It's a cute joint tho. The customer service was good. There aren't a billion options to choose from, so it's good they specialize in only a few sandwiches. I think they should work on developing the flavors of their meat a little more. But then again if it ain't broke, don't fix it."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I just need to man up. Have a little prep talk with my lady aka my SUV before we head to Le's. Horrible parking lot. So many pot holes. Your car will so mad at you if you go but it's soo worth it. 
This place is a gem. The gentleman working behind the counter was so patient with me while he tried to understand my broken Vietnamese and English. I was trying to describe to him what my mom ordered every time she's comes here. Simple deli meats with fresh cilantro and pickle carrots, butter/mayo sitting in a nice slightly toasted French baguette. Omg. I'm in heaven. The sandwich only costed me $3.29. I was soo shock I added a soy milk and iced French coffee mixed w.condensed milk.. I know it's a weird combination... But try it... I will never order another sub from Subway as long as this place is open... But remember if you want to try this place out.. BRING CASH!! They don't accept credit..."}
{"text":"I found Le's on Yelp* while looking for little gems to eat along N. Tryon Street--and there are plenty, too!  Le's Sandwich & Cafe is buried behind the Asian Corner Mall on Sugar Creek and N Tryon.  You'll know you're there 'cause the building looks like a bomb shelter (the driveway looks like it was hit in several places, too--seriously--you can lose a fender from your car in some of those potholes)!  However, Le's is a great little place for some freshly made, Korean-style banh mi sandwiches all at great prices.  I love the contrast of the soft toasted roll, the warm and spicy meat, the chill of the expertly cut veggies, and especially--the crunch.  Mmmm!

They offer about 8 different riffs on the same item, so my tip is to order #1 and work your way up to #8 as you return.  It's loads of fun, the staff will help with your order, and if you're lucky, find a seat at one of only a handful of tables.  CASH ONLY (and no ATM's in sight)."}
{"text":"Was craving a Vietnamese sandwich so did a yelp search and decided to hit up Le's. As we pulled up into the Plaza, a part of me wanted to leave because the parking lot was filled w pot holes and trash and the plaza was not in the best of shape. But we decided to check it out anyways. When we walked into the Plaza - there was a line for Le's Vietnamese sandwich. When we saw that line we knew it would be good. We ordered the combination #1 and grilled pork #6 and they did not disappoint. The combo was. $3.75 - it was amazing and affordable which is why I give this spot 5 stars. Good food and great value"}
{"text":"#11 (w/jalapeños!) is the best sandwich I've ever eaten, hands down! 
GO NOWWWWWWWWWW"}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte for Banh Mi for best bang for the buck. When you come here you gotta get alot of banh mi for the family. Make sure to bring cash since card is not accepted"}
{"text":"Hard to find but once I read the reviews on Yelp I figured it out. Creepy mall entrance but Le's is very clean and the service is extremely friendly. One bahn mi sandwich was $4 and VERY worth it. Fresh and delicious! Would definitely come here again...not alone though lol"}
{"text":"I  ordered #6 for *years* and tried most other sandwiches on Le's board until I finally stretched this year and tried the two I wasn't sure I would like... Firstly #3. the meatball.  It is honestly the most amazing meatball sandwich to exist in the history of meatball sandwiches if you love Le's. I avoided it for years because I thought it would be the meatballs that were served in most Pho. Dense, chewy, thick.  How wrong I was in finally tasting the softest decadent delicious banh mi meatballs.  

Well. I stepped out of my comfort box and secondly tried #9.  I grew up in a family that ate anchovies and sardines and I *hated* it.  Feared the salted critters.  However...I have loved Le's and for years and I told myself one day I will try #9. Today I did.
It was amazing...I hate to say the most amazing tuna sandwich ever for a comparison but truly the most amazing tuna sandwich ever.. take what you think about an american \"tuna\" but not slathered in mayo and add cilantro, jalapeños and pickled carrots with a beautiful crusty baguette."}
{"text":"Why buy just one? After years of hearing about Le's, I finally made a stop. Thankfully Yelpers are great about directions because there is nothing on the outside of the mall that indicates its existence. 

It's in the mall, go down main hallway, turn right.

There's only one, maybe two tables. Most people just get sandwiches to go. If you're really in a hurry there are bags of sandwiches in the refrigerators to the side. 

Like others warned, bring cash only. I live in a world of plastic, so you know I went to a great deal of preparation to try a Bahn Mi. I wish they'd open a location closer to me; I'd be a regular if that we're the case. Delicious and light on the pocket book. My two faves."}
{"text":"Delicious but cash only and closed on Wednesday. Ditto to what everyone has said in here. Fast service! Loyal customer even though the place is pretty scary. Best sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've recently been craving some banh mi and actually tried to make them at home, but it was way too much work!  So thankfully I was in the Charlotte area and decide to see where I might be able to get some.  Thankfully Le's showed up on Yelp search so she was bookmarked for some future eats.  

After a conference I headed over to Le's which is located in a gritty, seedy, Asian mall which re-defines the term, low-rent.  Funny, but there's an Asian market JUST like this up in Raleigh so I felt right at home.  Inside, Le's has a small store-front, short menu and they serve their sandwiches in short and long rolls.  I go for a meatball and roast pork in a long bun which to me is more VN tradition.  The sandwiches are made fresh and took 10 minutes or so.  I get a small bag with my sammiches and I'm off.  Didn't get to eat them until after they cooled down but loved the light bread, Le's stuffs their sandwiches with lots of carrot, daikon and cilantro, yum.  And the meat was well-done, not stuffed with meat but enough to make for a balanced sandwich.  So rock on Le's!  If you're willing to brave their dingy location, it's well worth the trip for their tasty banh mi."}
{"text":"The parking lot blah, blah, blah. The location blah, blah, blah. Get over yourselves and realize its the BEST SANDWICH in Charlotte. The service is always spectacular and the Banh Mi is off the wall good, and for the price, it cannot be beat. If you don't crave these sandwiches, you may want to have your head checked. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Cash only.  Always remember that!  So...Yes, as you drive into the parking lot the first time you think \"this can't be right\".  As you walk into the building for the first time, you think \"this can't be safe\".  And when you bite into one of these sandwiches for the first time, you think \"Damn, that's a delicious sandwich!\" Kara and I love this place. If you haven't tried it, do! And bring cash!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live just about a mile away from Le's and I don't think this is a coincidence, a higher power put is in that house knowing that one day we would find this hole in the wall and become dependent on it.

I've tried just about every single sandwich on the board, but my go-to is the number 6 grilled pork sandwich. This place is simple, cheap and delicious and the owners are very friendly. I think the 8\" is about $3.50 and the 12\" is $4, really can't beat that. They have Sriracha up by the bar too, adding that not only adds a little bit of spice, but also moistens the sandwich. All sandwiches come with mayo, jalapeño slices, cilantro, carrots, and cucumber on the typical french baguette style Banh Mi bread. The bread absolutely makes the sandwich, it's crunch on the outside and fluffy on the inside and is the perfect delivery vehicle for the ingredients inside.

Aside from the sandwiches, the sunflower cookies are completely addicting and a complete steal at $1.75 a pack, they are unlike any cookie I've ever had before, kind of like a cross between a fortune cookie and a funnel cake... I also LOVE their Vietnamese iced coffee and think it's some of the best in Charlotte. The final item that we're completely addicted to is the creamed corn pudding type dessert that comes in a clear plastic cup and is kept in the refrigerator to the right of the door. Do not be intimidated by it, it is rich, yet refreshing at the same time and a very popular summer treat in Vietnam. It has creamed corn on the bottom and some sort of sweet cream on top, maybe with coconut milk, you mix it all together and it is the perfect treat after one of their famous Banh Mis!

If you have an SUV, drive that, because the pavement in the Asian Corner Mall is a disaster, and even with an SUV you have to be very careful. There are 2 identical entrances to the mall, you want to go in the one that says \"Dragon Court\" on the top, go down the hall and take the 1st right and you'll run right into Le's!"}
{"text":"The best banh mi we've had in trying a half-dozen places throughout North Carolina! In fact, I'm not sure I've had better in my travels in Vietnam. Banh mi (pronounced something like 'bang me' in English, not 'bahn me') is French-Vietnamese fusion cuisine - French bread  (banh mi literally means bread made of wheat) made into a sandwich with various meats, coriander leaves, and Vietnamese pickles. This restaurant is very basic - limited seating and nothing fancy - and in a very run-down, almost abandoned looking shopping center, but well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"It's really good! I'm so glad this place exists in Charlotte. I get extra veggies and the grilled pork every time. Delish! Try it!"}
{"text":"Banh Mi!!! I was so ecstatic to find some place serving that was rated decently I almost went 40 over on the freeway.. I love Banh Mi and have been blessed to have some really good viet sandwich shops in Houston for majority of my life. That being said, my expectation for this place was way too high, to a point I might be underrating it by a star.

- Location
Unless you've been to some Chinatown places the location may or may not freak you out a bit. In like a \"I Am Legend\" sort of way the shop is located inside a deserted Viet mall which has a equally deserted parking lot. You have to go look for it which may actually deter quite a few people, but inside its pretty much as fast food as you can get. Limited seating space with quick sandwiches.

- The Banh Mi
I'll just break it down simply:
- Bread is not nearly as crisp as it should be (honestly I don't even think its a French Baguette)
- Meat is just not tender and it seems to have been sitting there for ages (rubbery).
- The veggies they put in are fresh, which is good.
- THEY DONT HAVE EGG :( - This really put me over the edge because any good Banh Mi has a fried egg in it.

All of that while only being able to pay cash really just makes this place fall short. If you've never had a banh mi or don't have it often, you'll most likely like this place. For those of us who have  been cultured, it's just not acceptable."}
{"text":"After navigating the treacherous parking lot and the creepy \"abandoned mall\" feeling hallway you will see the giant line out the door right away.

I've never eaten anywhere else in the Asian Market but I plan too as there looked to be several interesting options.

I went with the #6 - basic pork sandwich. The sugarcane juice looked amazing as did the bubble tea offerings. They also sell candy by weight. Sandwich was on a delicious baguette and was lovely. A bit thin on the pork - I would consider adding pate next time. But for $4 it was well balanced and the line out the door does not lie!"}
{"text":"Rundown shopping centers that look like a bomb went off always have the best banh mi. The center where Le's is located is no different.

Not much to say that hasn't already been covered so I'll make this brief. Le's has a super tasty veggie option which is always a plus. My wife enjoyed her pork skin quite a bit. The price was more than fair. My only requests would be more jalapeños and more meat, please."}
{"text":"First, this place is in the Asian Corners shopping center.  the mall is a dump, the parking lot is a maze of potholes, and there is a general sketchiness about the area.  scary movies could be filmed there.  

now that that's out of the way, THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!  you mean you can get a large baguette (over a foot long), choice of meat, a slew of fresh daikon, cucumber, peppers, onion, and cilantro, and some hot sauce all for $3.50?  surely this is can't be real life.  they even have one that is $2.50.  they offer a short baguette, but i didn't see one person order one.  meat choices several variations on pork (bbq, grilled, steamed,etc), grilled chicken, and even sardines.  even offer veggie option.  drink selection is minimal, with can sodas, bottle water, and assorted asian drinks for purchase.  

Note they are CASH ONLY.  my only dilemma after finishing my wonderful sandwich was whether or not to buy another one immediately.  ultimately i did not, and really do regret that decision.  I haven't stopped thinking about going back since i left.  

also, be sure to hit up the nearby asian markets for other fun filled adventures.

UPDATE - just came back from los angeles, where the asian population is huge and restaurants are everywhere, and i got banh mi from a couple different places.  i'm happy to say that le's still comes out on top."}
{"text":"Delicious Sandwhich!  I had BBQ pork in hte Baguette.   Wow!  I am going back today.  $3.50 for the Sandwich.   The building is rough, and so is the parking lot, but the sandwich is the best!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly these sandwiches are AMAHZING!  Seriously, the bread alone is so fresh and moist. I believe these are the best manh mi sandwiches in Charlotte.  The atmosphere is extremely unassuming, but the best places are.  It's a diamond hidden in a rough.  

Bottom line: These sandwiches are made with the freshest ingredients, the service is great, it's a family-owned business and the food is just plain delicious.  What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwich and Vietnamese Ice Coffee.. also great price.. best combo cheap and good."}
{"text":"Hopefully your car doesn't bottom out on the way here. Am I doing this right? Based on the reviews it looks like it's mandatory to poke fun at the parking lot.

Now that that's out of the way, what a great experience! If you think they're over hyped, think again. Le's is recognized as one of the best sandwich shops in the QC and humble about their acclaim as well, with just two newspaper articles about their success on the wall (unlike Five Guys, literally if 5 year old Billy down the street said something good about their food, they probably have it framed and posted on the wall!).

So on to the food. I got the #1 and #6, Classic Combination and BBQ Pork. Both fantastic, if you're a veteran Banh Mi buyer it's exactly what you'd expect, maybe more! The most noteworthy is the price. Compared to other places in Charlotte you'll pay the same price for a sandwich but get a much bigger roll and more fillings. Crisp, fresh veggies topped with cilantro, and a generous portion of whatever meat you choose. Be warned that like most Viet places they do not cut out the seeds or the membrane on the Jalapenos, but fortunately they're usually near the top where you can pick them out (or leave them if your brave, or trying to impress your gal/guy/grandma/whoever!).

Service is quaint, but definitely on the friendly side. I received a smile and the man at the counter ran over and offered another bag when I went to get my drinks (They have canned Coke products, as well as Boba Tea smoothies and a few other bottled/canned options).

I'd definitely recommend, even go out of my way to come back. Just make sure you bring your lifted Jeep 4x4 with 43\" Tires and a wench on your next trip."}
{"text":"We tried to hit up Le's once before, but after surviving the treacherous parking lot, we had to turn around because we didn't have any dolla-dolla bills... So, with cash in hand, we headed back for round 2. Le's is a small, unassuming shop amidst the rows of Vietnamese shops. Order by number and pay at the counter (CASH only!!). We got the #2 (chicken) and #6 (cured pork). Both were tasty, not the best we've ever had but good. The thing that really put Le's on the map for me was their sugar cane juice!! Oh man... it sounded like it would be disgustingly sweet but it wasn't. It had a subtly fresh citrus taste and it was perfectly (not overly) sweet. Also got the strawberry surf boba... umm... let's just say I'll never order a boba smoothie from them again."}
{"text":"I love Bahn Mi's and Vietnamese coffee. My go to order is the Combo #7 (as is) and a Cafe Sua Da (best iced coffee ever!!!) so a full meal for about $7. This place is fantastic. Food is fresh, service is fast, coffee is great, prices are cheap.  As of the last time I went, they only take cash and are closed on Wednesdays. I wish I could give more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Get  the  #6.  Best banh mi in Charlotte."}
{"text":"What a true hidden gem in Charlotte!! Tucked away back in a little Asian market, we found out about Le's from Yelp! And let me say if I didn't see it here I would of never of known about it!

Le's is family owned and their menu consist of different Banh Mi sandwiches. We were given a recommendation to try the original #6 and cold cut #7. My husband and I split both. The winner for me was the classic. The #6 pork was my favorite and the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly - with a little kick of spice. My husband preferred the cold cut classic, but both were winners in my book. The bread was also just right - soft on the Inside- with a nice crunch on the outside. 

We also ordered Vietnamese ice coffee. We were warned before hand that it's super strong so we got some extra condensed milk added. It was smooth and delicious with a hint of cocoa to it. Very good!! Highly recommend! 

Will I be back? Hell ya!!! Should you go? Hell ya!!!"}
{"text":"As others have said, the shopping center is a little rough (literally). The potholes are probably just a cheaper alternative to speed bumps. The food is definitely worth the adventure though. The bread is crusty and fresh and the meats and veg are flavorful and delicious. The staff (owner?) was also extremely friendly and polite. Would definitely venture back to Le's for some tasty treats."}
{"text":"I'll admit I'm a bit scared walking into this strip mall that looks sketchy on the outside and a ghost town on the inside. But I'll brave the dangers to get to this delicious banh mi shop!

Yummy crispy baguettes slathered with some sort of butter inside with your choice of meats then topped off with a fragrant corsage of cilantro and crunchy pickled veggies. You definitely get a nice mix of textures in every bite.

Skip going to subway the next time you're in this section of town and go for a banh mi instead for a delicious experience! It's cheaper too!"}
{"text":"Forgot to Check-In && photos to come later (I have half a #9 waiting just for you guys!) but THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS! First, I have to admit: the Banh Mi is my favorite style of sandwich next to a grilled cheese.. so, I might be a little biased. Second, I have tried every Banh Mi on any menu I've seen in Charlotte & this place is the best. Hands down. Value, taste AND quality can NOT be beat! I don't eat meat so my go-to is the #9. The #6 & #2 are the faves of my carnivorous family members, however! My picky & embarrassingly spoiled children who had never had a Banh Mi & devoured these in seconds! Even thanked me for making them try it! That's a grand stand win in my book! 

P.S. I'm sure you've read about the dilapidated building of a mall it's in.... nothing compared to the musty eel skin smell all throughout the mall. Just saying... be prepared for your appetite to be distracted. I couldn't sit & eat because of it. It was also a hot August afternoon ... ?"}
{"text":"Realizing that there are SOOO many locations to get banh mi in Charlotte, we're always reduced to having one choice, Le's Sandwiches. This sandwich is a staple for my culture and I tend to be picky on where I go to get my fix. Considering the fact that this is the only decent location in Charlotte, my review rating will be a little inflated for what their actually worth. 

This little small shop in Asian Corner is a hidden gem among the busy passerby's who haven't had the chance to snack upon this staple. Locally owned and operated by a mom and pop, the place screams support small businesses like us. And that's something you should definitely do. You're not only supporting them, but also getting a little taste of Vietnam. 

The bread used here is baked fresh and you need to come early as they will usually run out by 4 or 5 PM. Ask for it to be toasted. That's a true version with whatever sandwich you order. I notice people don't ask for that and yuck, just yuck. You need it toasted to get that crunch from the bread and boosted flavor from the heat. I usually get their special for $4.00, which in all honesty is a little high. The meats are sliced in standard affair and depending on which sandwich, you can have a bland taste to tastebud popping when you chew on a pepper-corn. However, they've been cutting down on their meat quality and putting more liver patte and lard in. Veggies of course are fresh and the jalapeno peppers are guaranteed to make you sweat. 

Service is friendly and be sure to bring CASH, folks. They don't accept CC like many Asian stores. For what it's worth in Charlotte, you can get a decent Vietnamese sandwich here."}
{"text":"It's inside the mall. And don't get freaked out that the mall is old and dirty. It's a great tasting banh mi sandwich and I know my Vietnamese sandwiches. The most critical aspect is the baguette and they got it right. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Yes!  Banh Mi  YES!  YEST!  FANTASTIC and this is my fourth meal today in 6 hours, so I'm not even a little hungry!

Mr. Le asked me if I had ever been here and when I said no, he said get the #6.  He was correct.  An EXCELLENT choice!  This one is similar to a Banh Mi I have eaten in Union County.  The #6 is a Grilled Pork with lots of Cilantro, carrots, cucumbers, hot peppers, pickled Daikon on a fantastic Roll (I not not know how to spell Baguette).  As I requested: NO Butter!  NO Mayo!

Totally Affordable!  Most of the Sandwiches are under $4.00 and they are plenty big unless you are a Wild Boar in Training like me.  I'm thinking about getting Mr. Le to make a Special Sandwich for me and I'll pay him more than he asks!  I know I'm crazy.

I'm the only non-Asian person eating or even ordering here, so that is cool!  Some of the patrons asked me how I like it and told me to come back and get a different one each time!  I saw some more choices I bet I would love!

First Note:  CASH ONLY!  So remember bring folding $ No Plastic, No Checks, No Monopoly $!

No te: Hopefully you will not need a rest room - Le's does not have one and that is all you should know.  If you have to go I suggest you plan ahead and go right before you arrive.  READ C A R E F U L L Y   You do not want to visit the Mall rest rooms... It is probably not safe in any meaning of the word and in no way can I use the word clean because it does not apply!

Last NOte:  Today was my first visit to Mr. Le's, though it was my second visit to this Mall - It has been three or four years since I have been here and it was not in good shape then - It has gone from sketchy to approaching scary.  Le's is nice and clean, the Mall he is located in is the opposite!  I recommend as always: beware of your surroundings, travel in a group, act confident (even if you are not) and if you are trained and certified this would be a time not to leave home without \"it\" (I'm not talkin' AMEX) Le's is Cash only.  I'm not talking about Cousin It either, though Cousin It may be some help here!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes. This place is my new favorite in Charlotte. The ingredients are fresh, the food is cheap and service is friendly. What else can you ask for? 

There's 10 or 11 things on the menu. Everything is under $5. A Pork Banh Mi will run you $4.25 and it's plenty of food. 

They also serve Boba Tea and some other homemade items like Curry Beef Jerky and Vietnamese Cookies. 

I will definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Who needs a dollar menu meal  when one can get a delicious sandwich here. It's Vietnamese to go. Once you try one you will keep coming back.

Still as good as ever."}
{"text":"Love this place! Well the good at least. The location is horrible: inside a essentially
Deserted shopping mall. I was constantly glancing I'm all directions around me to be safe while holding my nose from the stench. The parking lot was even worse. I've seen fewer pot holes in DC.

But I can forgive all of that, all of it when I get friendly service, bar none food, and incredibly cheap prices. A banh mi for four dollars! Make sure you have cash though as its cash only. And the parking lot can be a bit hard to exit during rush hour so I'd work around that if possible.

But in any event, Le's is one of my favorites and is defined worth a visit. If anyone finds a better banh mi place in Charlotte, slim pickings I know, let me know. I might just have to go live there..."}
{"text":"This place has never made a sandwich that I don't like. The sandwich I usually get is the Banh Mi Thit Nguoi...and occasionally the Banh Mi Nem Nuong. The sandwiches here are always so satisfying. You can feed a person for around $3.50....which is a great deal. I've found that the pickles are really important when eating a Vietnamese sandwich, and this place has really good pickled carrot and daikon. Furthermore, the meat is always tasty and lean. My family has gotten the sandwich from the nearby Vien Dong supermarket before and the meat in there was so fatty....there was barely any real meat! But this sandwich is lean, refreshing, tasty, and you would almost always want more. My family and I travel a lot, and we always go to Charlotte to buy some sandwiches before our road trips, so I've pretty much had sandwiches from all the sandwich shops that are worth mentioning. This is, by far, the best. 

Another thing that they have that I absolutely love is the Cane Juice drink. It's a childhood favorite of mine from living in Vietnam, and there have been attempts in the area to make fresh cane juice, but this place has the best. I love getting those in the summer time when I drop by to get a sandwich. If you've never had it, I think it's worth trying. It's pressed cane juice with a squeeze of either lime or this small little green citrus fruit that I think is called Kalamansi (?)."}
{"text":"Not the BEST Vietnamese sandwiches that I've had, but of course one of the only good ones in Charlotte. Love the fact that their bread is always fresh, but wish they didn't skimp out on the meat they put in the sandwiches. Regardless, if you're looking for a good banh mi in the area, this is the place to go. They also have bubble tea (again, not the greatest, but decent). Remember to bring cash! They don't take debit/credit."}
{"text":"I have never had Vietnamese sandwiches before, but loved them. The vegetarian sandwich had some impressive tofu, and the veggies were extremely fresh and delish."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! 
For once the reviews are right, finally!!! To tell the truth I never doubted this place, there's no way Charlotteans would recommend this derelict third world location otherwise. 

OK, the truth is Le's doesn't need any more praise, so why this review then? 

Because baguette is French bread and Jambon means ham, that why. I want to remind lovers of JJ's \"lunchables\" what they aren't getting : FLAVOR!  the pop in your mouth wow they're totally missing. Or french bread, contrary to their advertisement that's not what JJ serves, it's hoagies. 

On the flavor scale if Le's is a 5 then JJ lumps taste a solid .... 0.5."}
{"text":"The sandwich was so so good. The parking lot, I wish I could've avoided it. But nothing will deter me from eating there again."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I had to check this place out.  I walked in and (presumably) the owner says, \"First time?\" To which I reply, \"yes.\" He says, \"Numba 6 then.\"

I'm eating it as I write this review.  It's awesome.  I've never had a sandwich like this before, and probably won't until I come back here again.  I had to look up at the wall to get the correct spelling for \"Banh Mi.\"  Never heard of that before!  Whatever you call it, it's delicious.  It's cheap, too.  $3.25 will get you one, but bring cash because they don't accept credit cards.  Enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"If I have to get a Banh Mi sandwich in Charlotte, this is the spot. This place neatly tucked in Asian Corner provides cheap and delicious sandwiches. I usually order the original number one, which is Le's Combination, but this is because I remember growing up and eating these. You can order the longer type of bread (baguette) and savor more of your sandwich. It's not that much, usually just $.50 more depending on the sandwich.

Yes this place is awesome, but the tricky part is getting through that parking lot! Now we all know, and if you didn't know, that Asian Corner has some of the biggest pot holes in Charlotte. (I heard they were going to fix it a few months ago, but well it's still the same) Its called Asian Corner because in my opinion you have to corner your car around pot holes to get there. But once you're parked and secure, the fun begins!

I have to warn: ***Le's Only Accepts CASH*** So, bring out those dollar bills and put away those plastic cards. After you get your sandwich and take your first bite, you will understand why dodging all those pot holes was worth it. Come here and give yourself a pat on the back from parking and take a bite out of amazingness."}
{"text":"Carolina is full of fantastic Le's, and there's an extra one when I'm in the state.

Here is yet another example of that. Oh wait.

It's probably the highlight of this excellent Vietnamese Plaza way up in Northeast Charlotte. The sandwich didn't rock my world but the guava drink definitely did - and I will be back for that and to try other things.

Definitely one of the best guava drinks I've had lately. And really good service and prices as well - although some of the other customers were not friendly at all and pushed in front of me in line. Settle down NYC wannabes.

My short notes: Amazing Guava drink, Banh Mi was long and cheap and not bad.

Now speaking of long and cheap and not bad, are you free tonight."}
{"text":"Listen. Le's banh mi's are wonderful. Better than some of the banh mi's I had in Vietnam! You must must must get the BBQ pork banh mi WITH pate. The fresh toppings are clutch. The bread has the perfect balance of crusty outside and chewy inside. Sure, the Asian Corner Mall parking lot has some potholes, and it's not in the \"perfect\" part of town. But, get out of your white picket fence bubble and get over it! This is what real Charlotte is and it's great!"}
{"text":"The experience starts in getting to Le's. You have to drive up North Tryon, which is not exactly the best part of town. You then turn into the parking lot of what looks like an abandoned mall. The parking lot is littered with potholes, making for a very interesting drive to find a parking space, almost none of which are even marked. The restaurant itself has almost no seating and only accepts cash.

None of that matters, though, once you bite into the sandwich. They are reasonably priced (cheap compared to the sandwich chains) and are very tasty. The meats are roasted and high quality, the vegetables are fresh, and the bread is excellent.

Do not let the appearance of the area fool you. Le's is a hidden gem, and the area itself is safe."}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches!!They are always prepared so fresh.You can't beat the price either.Make sure to have cash.I recommend this place to anyone.Upon arrival to the parking lot,the area can be a little skeptical but trust me you won't go wrong ordering from here."}
{"text":"since eating here 2 months ago, i've gone another 3-4 times.  the price is very reasonable and the taste can't be beat.  I've talked with Mr. Minh, the owner i believe, numerous times and he's a great guy.   i'm looking forward to next time"}
{"text":"Is the banh mi sandwich the best restaurant food bargain in the United States?

In just about every town in the United States that has Vietnamese food, you can usually get one of these sandwiches for under five dollars.

At Le's, you can get one for under four.

Are Le's the best banh mi sandwiches ever?  No.  They were a little on the dry side.  But they were damn good, and most of them cost three dollars and seventy five cents.  You can barely buy a crummy cheapjack processed burger at a fast-food joint for that price.  This banh mi sandwich, on the other hand, is made with fresh ingredients and with care.

The family that runs this little place was very nice.

P.S. Folks apparently feel the need to riff on the location of Le's in their Yelp reviews.  Sure, the mall is a bit scuzzy, and its parking lot is in horrible shape.  But:
--There is a review referring to this shopping center as \"post-apocalyptic.\"  (Not exactly, except for maybe the potholed satellite lane leading into the parking lot.  You might want to rent a Jeep to get here.)
--There is a review parodying Apocalypse Now, as though the last 35 years of Vietnamese immigration to this country had not happened, and even joking about the \"smell of napalm.\"  (That is some seriously bad taste right there.)
--There is a review denigrating Le's as a \"hipster jackpot,\" apparently because of its undesirable location.  Or something.  (Yes, Le's is \"hipster\" if \"hipsters\" consist largely of middle-aged and even older Vietnamese couples.  At least on the day we were there.) 
--There is a review that is mystified at the \"bell peppers\" in the sandwiches being so hot.  (I just referred to that one because it cracked me up.)

Guess what?  This mall caters largely to recent Asian immigrants, and such folks   normally aren't affluent by American standards.  They shop at inexpensive places, and these places are inexpensive because they have low rents.  That's why you're getting a banh mi here for the amazingly low price of $3.75, and not at the slick, safe strip mall in the lily-white part of town with the Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Talbots, and Sur La Table.  In any event, Le's space itself looks as clean as a whistle."}
{"text":"Well, this is my first time trying a Banh Mi sandwich, let alone vietnamese food. I really enjoyed it!!! It is different then the usual subs that you can get at those chain stores around town. Now the area/ shopping center that Le's Sandwich Cafe is a little sketchy and I never thought about going there before hearing about this place. So I put my big girl panties on and trekked to Le's Cafe to be a little adventurous with my husband. 

We walk in around lunch and ordered the #6 grilled pork that everyone on Yelp recommends. They also have bubble tea, which I loovvee, so I ordered a Taro bubble tea with tapioca pearls to go as well. My husband being the overly cautious foodie that he is was not feeling the vibe of the location or scenery and did not ordered anything, even though the Sanity rating was in the high 90's. (He later regretted it after I let him have a very tin bite).

So overall the Taro Bubble Tea was everything that I expected to be and the Banh Mi sandwich was delicious. The ingredients were fresh and prepared well, but I did not get any spicy notes. However I do regret not getting two. It was fresh and light and just what I needed for lunch. 

Highly recommend, but I give them 4/5 stars because it did not knocked my socks off."}
{"text":"The journey into this place sets an ominous mood as you navigate to into the mostly abandoned and very run down mall, but the sandwiches here are bomb. I typically get the combination (#7 I believe) with extra jalapeños.  Probably the best banh mi in Charlotte with low prices to boot. One thing to note is that it is cash only."}
{"text":"Hidden in the Asian Corner Mall, this sandwich shop is truly a gem. It doesn't look like much, but it is home to one of the best Banh Mi sandwiches in all of Charlotte. Get the #6 if you're a first timer. It will cause a party in your mouth. You're welcome"}
{"text":"Bread and ingredients are fresh and amazing. Chicken is pretty foul. Not tasty and the meat is... brown?"}
{"text":"The best Bahn Mi in Charlotte. It's location & looks make it an adventure. Don't forget to check out the surrounding shops & grocery, super cheap herbs & veg."}
{"text":"The sandwich was pretty good (pork bahn mi). The boba flavor (thai tea & mango) was a bit bland and boba themselves hard. Area is not the best and they only accept cash."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said?

- Nikki's review is spot-on for directions.
- The parking lot does look and feel like a bomb went off in it. Take the oldest car you own.
- They only accept cash.
- The man behind the cash register was the nicest, most friendly guy ever!
- There are only 3 two-top tables inside, so be prepared to take it to-go. We got lucky enough to snag a table at 4:30 pm on a Saturday. They close at 6:00.
- I got the #6 and #8, and the fella got the #5. We both agreed the #8 (BBQ pork) was our least favorite, but I liked the #6 (pork banh mi) best, and he liked his #5 best (cured pork banh mi).
- They were pretty darn delicious! I still think Peculiar Rabbit had the best banh mi I've ever had, but this was definitely the most authentic one I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Love the grilled pork banh mi. Best on the east coast."}
{"text":"Le's is one of those places that I've known about for a long time, but never quite managed to visit. Fortunately, we live a lot closer to them now, so this past weekend seemed ideal for a takeout lunch. I was thrilled to find out that they live up to their reputation. I ordered a number 6 (the grilled pork sandwich) on a baguette, and I was ready to lick the paper when I was done eating it. If you've never been, I highly recommend you start with this.

Their store is pretty plain, but that's not an issue when the food is so good and cheap. The parking lot at Asian Corner's isn't as bad as some folks make it out to be so long as you are proactive at driving around and straddling pot holes."}
{"text":"Warning! Unless you're an intrepid foodie or otherwise familiar with Asian Corners, you could easily be thrown off course by these reviews. This place, like Asian Corners, is- pardon the bad pun- pho real. No frills, no fuss, and yesterday- January 24- no heat in the mall area. That didn't stop a throng of happy Asian kids from riding bikes and rollerskating in the mall courtyard area. Come to think of it, what a great place for kids to go- sort of like the malls of my childhood- where kids were free to roam while parents' watchful eyes were ever-present. No, this place is located in the heart of Charlotte's \"China Town,' an authentic  spot for those serious about authentic Asian food.

Le's Sandwich Shop, which has received some recent mention in local media, is absolutely worth seeking out. If for no other reason, it is fascinating to witness this \"hidden\" part of Charlotte. Parking lot potholes and sagging ceiling tiles notwithstanding, the Asian Corners shopping center is a piece of Asian-Americana not to be missed.

And the banh mi sandwiches??? Mais oui! The baguette bread was lightly toasted and pleasantly fluffy inside. I ordered the #6 pork sandwich, and it came loaded with succulent sliced seasoned pork, thinly sliced onions, thinly sliced peppers, cilantro and- nothing else! THAT was the beauty of the sandwich: its simplicity was unmarred with too much stuff. There was, however, a jar of hot sauce, plus salt and pepper on the counter. The price tag? Three bucks.

I also tasted the Taro bubble tea, which on a freezing cold day, was probably not the best idea. As bubble teas go this was good. It was also made-to-order as the constant whirring of the blender reminded me.

Go for experience. Go for the low price. Go for the taste. But by all means go experience this authentic Vietnamese taste treat."}
{"text":"I found out about Le's yesterday and went for lunch today. I got the  #6 pork sandwich that got all the raves. I was going to get a variety of sandwiches to taste, but it's pretty much 1 chicken sandwich, 1 meatball sandwich (pork meatball?) and 5 or 6 different pork sandwiches.

The sandwich was really good. The pork had a great tasting marinade. The bread and the veggies were fresh. Service was super friendly.
 
There's all sorts of candies and puddings? Not quite sure what it was but plenty for adventurous eaters to try. You don't have to be too adventurous an eater for the sandwiches though. They also have bubble tea.

The only negative is location, which isn't that big of a deal. I felt a little uncomfortable the first time I went to that strip mall, but I got over it quickly."}
{"text":"Like so many others on yelp, I had the #6, pork banh mi. It was delicious. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I'm all for branching outside the \"American Food\" comfort box. But when I tried this place I honestly didn't like it. First off the place does not accept debit cards...it's 2014 people. Second the sandwich was not good. I had the chicken sandwich. The meat had a weird flavor and aftertaste and the bread was pretty hard. The pickled vegetables weren't good either. The sandwich itself wasn't cold or hot it was just kinda lukewarm. Overall I don't approve. I don't see myself ever going back."}
{"text":"Not many people know of this place since it's inside the shopping center, but hands down one of the best Vietnamese banh mi stores in Charlotte. Great sandwiches for a cheap price."}
{"text":"retro review form Sept 2015:  im sorta obsessed with Banh Mi sandwiches and was highly distraught when my fav placed closed down forever in Rochester. So when visiting my bf in Charlotte i saw this place on yelp and knew i had to go get my fix.  We were planning a hike on crowders mountain that weekend and I figured whats better then a couple sandwiches to have once we reached the top. We ordered a number 1 and a number 8 and we also got a mango boba. The boba was good, but iv had better when fresh mango was used, this was frozen and a bit artificial tasting but still yummy.  So when we finally had the sandwich i has told my bf one of the sandwiches had head cheese without actually defining what head cheese was ( evil laugh  hehehehe). He was chopping them both down and enjoying it throughly but then when i defined head cheese he got icked out at the thought and stuck to the grilled pork one.  Silly Boy! Head Cheese is where its at!!!! Anyways this place is cheap and super yummy definitely worth checking out (even without the head cheese i supppppose....)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The sandwiches are so fresh and tasty that it's my go to place when I'm in Charlotte.  The location is bad, but they keep their space clean."}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful for firstimers. The banh mi (#6 & #7) were just delightful. Everything is so fresh and the bread is perfectly crispy outside and soft inside. Glad I found this gem!"}
{"text":"Overall the sandwich #6 was tasty and I loved the bread. I also picked up some of the beef jerky. I prefer the pieces to the strips as it has more curry flavor and heat.  I will go again and try the other sandwiches. Word of advice don't eat and drive if you can help it. I had the unpleasant experience of taking a bite and shooting something hot into my eye. I can hilariously tell my friends that Le's sandwich almost made me wreck my car. LoL!"}
{"text":"In all fairness, I've only tried the one sandwich (#6 grilled pork), but I can already tell I'll be a regular at Le's from here on out. I've been meaning to get by there for weeks - I'm so glad I finally made it ! If you're already a fan of banh mi, suffice to say that you'll find what you are looking for here. If you've never tried one, this would be a great place to start if you've an adventurous culinary spirit. As mentioned by another reviewer, this place is close to NoDa but without the gentrified prices, made possible by the location in the semi-abandoned Asian Corner mall. Keep in mind that Le's is INSIDE the mall, I kind of overlooked that bit of info and almost gave up on finding it. I'm not sure what the hours are, but I think they may just be open for lunch (I tried to call but just got the fax machine). As far as the setting, consider the potholes in the parking lot an amusing obstacle course, and if you aren't driving a low-riding compact like me you may just want to bounce all over those things for fun.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Best banh mi in town. Flavorful grilled pork with fresh cilantro and jalapenos, pickled daikon and carrots on a fresh baguette. Can't beat the price. I usually get two - one for today, one for tomorrow! The parking lot definitely needs some work (pot hole city) but its TOTALLY worth the trip. That's pretty much all you need to know. Go!!"}
{"text":"This place is 2 legit to quit. It's inside of a very old shopping center called the Asian Corner Mall, but definitely worth coming here for its sandwiches. No gimmicks on the sandwiches, just the originals but they're delicious. Not sure if the bread is baked in house, but it was certainly so be if the best I've had for banh mi."}
{"text":"The owner who runs the register is a very sweet little older man. Super upbeat and will make and customize your banh mi according to your liking. The banh mi is huge! Literally one is enough for two servings. Very very reasonably priced. We ordered sugar cane drinks and they were amazing! On the table they had beef jerky in small bags to buy and in the fridge we picked up a bag of nem chua. Highly recommend but do beware of the parking lot, definitely a hazard to drive through"}
{"text":"Sooooo I have been wanting to try their bahn mi for literally years!!!!  So it was time.  I was in the vicinity, hungry and ready to attempt this.

The parking lot is hella scary and you better pay attention.  I was driving in a very crazy pattern to miss blowing out my tires.

The plaza is also hella scary.  If it wasn't for Yelp I'd be real nervous- and was also a little freaked out today, not gonna lie...

But the service was quick and friendly!  I had my baby with me and the man who waited on me spoke great English and we chatted about our sons.  My sandwich was made in about 2 minutes.  I got the #6 with everything!  I took it to go and it was great!  My mouth is still burning from the fresh jalapeño!  With tax, it was $4.60.  Not huge but a great lunch portion!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have a business less than 2 miles from this place and I drive by there several times a day. That particular stretch of N. Tryon is sorely lacking in hole-in-the-wall dives that us foodies crave. There's some great spots over in Noda but most, besides Brooks Sandwich house, can be a little pricey for lunch. And I have to hang close when I leave for lunch, or I could be missing customers. So someone mentions this place on Facebook. I was instantly curious. I grew up in Charlotte. I remember when this  mall was a thriving retail center with a Kohls type of store called Peebles on one end and a Park-n-Shop grocery store located where compare foods. And a couple times a year there'd be a carnival set up in the parking lot at night, that is until some of the carnies burned down a Firestone car service center which explains the grass lawn out in the middle of the once paved lot,  and the carnival was forbidden to ever return. The place is a dilapidated shadow of it's former glory. So part of me wanted to just see how the inside of the  place compared to the memories of my youth. When you walk in the mall you'll immediately think you've made a mistake. \"There's no way a business is operating in here, right?\". Wrong. When you round the corner you'll see very neat & clean, very well run eating spot called Le's. And let me tell you, when you bite into that #6 sandwich... You will immediately know that you've found a place that you'll put on your list of regular spots to eat."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! I had to haul down to a gas station ATM bc I forgot this. Still totally worth it. Park near the sign for Dragon Chinese - Le's is in the main door & to the right past the Asian grocery. 

While I've never met a banh mi I didn't like, they do tend to vary quite a bit in  flavor and price. Le's hits all the right notes in both regards. For around $3, these sandwiches are a steal. Go ahead and pay the extra couple quarters to get the larger version if your choice doesn't already come on one of their crispy, chewy baguettes. It's worth every penny and then some. 

Their pate and cured pork combination banh mi casually contains the kinds of flavors farm to table restaurants dream of achieving with their charcuterie platters: warm, chewy bread enveloping an earthy pate and very slightly sweet cured pork, perfectly balanced with crisp, bright cilantro and tart pickled vegetables. If you want a little added zing, ask them to add jalapenos to your sandwich.

The banh mi was so good, I almost forgot to mention why I came here in the first place - bubble tea! Tapioca pearls in the bottom of a tea or fruit based drink, including some interesting flavors like taro and durian. Their version is tasty and frozen, like a slushy with chewy beads in the bottom."}
{"text":"This place serves up what may be the best Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches in the Southeast.  They make their own baguettes, which are thinner, airy in the crumb and lightly crunchy on the crust.  You don't have to fight your way through a huge amount of bread to get to the inside.  The carrots and radishes are delicately pickled,  The meat is flavorful, and the herbs are fresh.  I don't know if this ends my quest for the One True Banh Mi, but it comes pretty close.  I've been all over large metropolitan areas like Atlanta, and this beats anything you'd find in places there like Lee's Bakery.  And yes, Le's Sandwiches has che (Vietnamese puddings)!  This store is a hidden gem.  You might have to brave panhandling hobos and other unsavory types, fight traffic to get in and out of there, traverse those moon crater-sized holes in the parking lot, and ignore the internal alarms going off that tell you your person and property aren't safe, but it's worth it.  It may be hell in the barrio, but the food is good and it makes life worth living."}
{"text":"Banh Mi - Vietnamese sub sandwiches, via French baguette (yum!)

Place - small, tight, only two tables for seating area. If you need a place to sit and eat your sandwiches, you can sit on the bench, outside the shop by the non operable water, by the fountain. 

Food - the banh mi #11 is good (steam pork meat). This time, I got #12 which is the same as #11, but longer, almost a foot. I normally don't like pâté, but with my Vietnamese sandwich, I had to have with it.  It just enhances the flavor of the sandwich, with their beurre (lard) --yummm!! They do a good job with the sandwiches here, it brings me close to home in Houston. 

Service - they can be quick as can be. The only gripe I have is that they do not take sugar cane orders, 30 minutes before closing!  I thought they close at 6:30pm, but the hours now is that they close at 6:00pm daily. Cash only, no exceptions -- had to go to an ATM."}
{"text":"Le's Banh Mi is freakin' delicious. Run, don't walk. The End."}
{"text":"WOW what a find!  Thanks for the tip on this place fellow yelpers!!

Yep it is a little scary to get here - not located in the best of areas.  Just go though - you will be fine.  The 'mall' itself is a bit smelly and delapitated but the sandwich shop itself is very clean and bright.

I had the #6 - grilled pork sandwich.  It is made fresh for you while you wait.  You can eat there or takeout.  Prices are very reasonable and service is super quick.  My sandwich was very fresh and the pork was not overly seasoned.  Very good!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the post apocalyptic strip mall look fool you (it's truly one of the worst conditioned strip malls that still operates in my humble opinion) , this is the most legit and delicious bahn mi in Charlotte.

Family owned, they work there everyday it is open... There English is a little broken up, but their menu is numbered so it's all good. There are a couple of chairs and a table, but it's mostly take out.

The French bread is awesome, the pickled veggies are delicious and the meat is well done (as in 'done nicely', not overcooked) .

This is one place in Charlotte I would not miss! If you want the best bahn mi in Charlotte, this is the only place to go. If you're hungry, get two... or ask for extra meat for $1.50 extra... well worth it!"}
{"text":"As a local, we all know the parking lot in Asian corner is not car friendly at all, but I always make an exception ONLY for le's sandwich shop. The bread is so perfect, not too toasted on top where it will take off the root of your gums ( we've all had over toasted bread before at one point in our lives, at least I have  ) we've literally ordered every single sandwich off the menu (not all in one sitting hah) and all were delish! For charlotte standards, i think le's is one of the best, So I say go go go!"}
{"text":"Confessions of a Crazy Southern Foodie or Lord, Have Mercy.....I'm Craving Bánh Mì.

It's Sunday at 3:30 p.m.

It's 58 degrees.

There's a cold rain falling.

It's the middle of football season, and the Charlotte Panthers are playing.

I'm wearing my favorite black, 3X, Chum Lee t-shirt. Khaki shorts. My favorite sweat stained khaki, but oh so comfortable, Nautica baseball cap with the leaping sailfish. I have on my most roached out but comfortable, twenty year old, gray Hushpuppies, that I use to mow the yard and paint. I haven't shaved today......

and I have an irresistible craving for Bánh Mì.

Most people would ignore the craving and watch the football game.

There is no other Bánh Mì in the immediate area that tops Le's, and it's over an hour away.

My solution, two words: \"Road Trip.\"

I slowly make my way to Charlotte via highway 321 and I-85 North. 

I exit at Sugar Creek, and take note of the two hookers ambling up the sidewalk. One has bright red hair, and I'm not so sure that the other one is not a trannie. I just know that I have never been drunk enough to contemplate hooking up with either.

Entering the Asian Corner Mall via the Greensboro Avenue entrance gives my vehicle the best chance for survival, so that's the plan. 

Getting to Le's basically means off-roading in one's car.

I get to Le's Sandwiches and there's a line back to the door. 

The people in front of me are first timers and they \"have no idea\" what they want to order. 

They look back at me and announce, \"maybe this man knows what he wants.\" This man DOES know, and he knew when he left home more than an hour ago.

Me: \"Two # 6's and one #8.\"

Mr. Le: \"For here or to go?\"

Me: \"To go.\"

Mr. Le: \"Do you want your sandwiches on a baguette?\"

{No hesitation}

Me: \"Yes!\"

Aside: If anyone ever asks you whether you want ANYTHING on a baguette, the answer should be a resounding \"YES!\"

Three Bánh Mì were made and I got back over a dollar in change from a ten spot. 

The ride home seems short. I contemplate my future, my job, and what I am passionate about. I reach the conclusion that my current job is not something that I care to do any longer. Life's too short to do something that one doesn't enjoy. 

I unwrapped a #6 and poured myself a homebrewed Cerveza, my next to last. I poured this into my Munich Oktoberfest one litre mug in honor of Hickory's Oktoberfest which was happening this weekend. I find that beer pairs extremely well with Le's Bánh Mì.

I ate the #6, and it was so delicious that I proceeded to devour a #8 as well. 

Were the sandwiches as good as I remember them?

\"Why, yes - yes they were.\"

Am I crazy for driving two hours round trip to get Bánh Mì at Le's Sandwiches?

\"Why, yes - yes I am.\" 

I freely admit that driving two hours to eat anywhere is insanity, but Le's Bánh Mì are totally worth the inconvenience and the lengthy drive.

On a positive note, I have one #6 Bánh Mì left for tomorrow, and an almost full bottle of Sriracha. 

Le's Sandwiches.....there is no substitute."}
{"text":"I just went today (after trying to go in September only to discover they were closed for a month, boo!) and had their #6 based off of recommendations from this page.

Absofrickinglutely delicious and I was kicking myself for not getting a second sandwich.  The grilled pork was delicious but the pickled vegetables and cilantro were really what made the sandwich,  A word of warning:  the bread is really crusty (in a good way) so be careful if you're going to eat in your car.  I was covered in crumbs when I got back out! ;)"}
{"text":"Per usual, my stars are for food not ambiance. Food is the most important thing here. Where is your sense of adventure folks?

I've been going to Le's for about 6 years now. It's located inside of Asian Corner Mall, formerly Tryon Mall if anyone can remember that far back. ACM happens to have the worst parking lot in all of Charlotte. You must dodge the large crater-like potholes as if they were land mines. These aren't normal potholes. They're the kind that your car could get swallowed by. Better yet, think of it more as off roading. Once you safely make it across the field of craters, beware, for when you step out of your vehicle there may be a few used syringes tossed about.  You don't want to step on those. Some of you may think I'm kidding. I'm not. It's bad. Push through. Those little flavor bombs of awesome are worth it. 

Tips: cash only, order #6, everything has a number, they also have bubble tea, bread is awesome. Again, order #6. The end."}

{"text":"As a rite of passage, it was finally time to bring my kids to Le's for their first Bahn Mi. What better place than here. There is none in Charlotte. Call me a Hipster. Call me a Foodie. Call me a Lumber sexual. I love to eat great food and I'm hoping my kids will grow up to follow in my footsteps.

Needless to say, the boys, even my picky eater, devoured the #6 that I got them (pickled carrots, cilantro and all).  It's just a damn good sandwich. I ate one and half myself and washed it down with their delicious, smoky and creamy iced coffee.

Le's attracts everyone from far and wide. I can't say enough wonderful things about Le's, except \"Please don't change\". I love to see a local business do so well, especially when it's so well deserved.

As a bonus, I managed not to hit any of the two hundred pot holes in the parking lot."}
{"text":"You have to walk inside the mall to find this hidden gem, but the store is clean, friendly Staff, and the sandwich is amazing. And at $5 you cant beat it!"}
{"text":"Getting to this location is indeed treacherous, but entirely worth it.  There was lots of activity in the parking lot on a recent Saturday, all seemingly legitimate business comings and goings, so even though the place looks scary, it really isn't.  The #6 Pork was wonderful, I will come back the next time I can brave the trek!

Someone should plea with Le's owners to open more than one location, and please on the south side of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Drove up to the shopping mall and had a moment where we thought \"maybe not\" but are so happy we persevered.  Puts all other Banh Mi I have had to shame.  Loved it.  So fresh and full of flavor.  Baguettes were stellar."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what you get as long as it comes on that bread. The sandwiches are really cheap too, and you can the bread by itself to take home if you want. Since I stopped eating wheat all I really miss is this bread and Martin's potato rolls."}
{"text":"The best I have ever had. Beats all the trendy hipster versions. I have eaten here long before these sandwiches were trendy. Definitely a pit stop every time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pretty. Darn. Delicious.  Even for someone like me that tries to stay away from bread, I had to try this place.  I'm glad I did.  First off, it's the cheapest meal in Charlotte as I know it.  I think my sandwich was $3.50.  That's crazy.  The chicken sub I got was spicy, fresh basil, carrots and utterly delicious. 

There is no seating in the place as I recall and it's cash only.  Also, be aware it's in the middle of a very run down Asian market so just be prepared for that but don't let it stop you from giving them a try.  No low carb options here either."}
{"text":"What a tasty sandwhich!!!! So worth the scary trip into the Asian mall!!!! I ordered the traditional pork Banh mi  the mall itself is very rundown and sketchy but the sandwhich shop is a bright, white, happy little shop! If you're down with Banh mi don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Wanna feel like you're taping your own episode of Anthony Bourdain's 'No Reservations' in Charlotte?  Let's rundown your checklist as we head over to Le's:

1.  You, the pious foodie, makes a pilgrimage to a part of town not showcased in the city's tourism materials, where you will be greatly outnumbered by people you never knew inhabited said city speaking a language that you cannot begin to decipher.  CHECK.

2.  In search of ethnic cuisine that is either hard to find or lacks authenticity at the more \"main stream\" food establishments.  CHECK.

3.  In a place that, upon first encounter, has you thinking, \"There's no way this can be sanitary!\"  CHECK.

4.  And, after throwing all caution aside, you dig in and find mastery in the most unlikeliest of places.  Nirvana ensues.  CHECK CHECK.

That is a trip to Le's and if the above appeals to you at all (along with the Viet-French fusion that is the banh mi sandwich) this is a must for Charlotte adventurers.  No big menus, no table-side service, no inkling this place even exists until you walk thru the rundown bomb-shelter of a mall and stumble upon this bustling corner shop.  Blind trust is finally rewarded.

Le's does one thing only and one thing well: the banh mi sandwich.  The freshest of French baguette- crisp on the outside, creamy smooth inside- kept warm till serving time.  The heat of fresh jalapeno and the fresh earthiness of cilantro.  Pickled vegetables layered in between.  Sounding good?   At less than $4.00 a piece, you'll likely find yourself wanting more than one,  but bring your Benjamin's, no plastic accepted here. 

As Anthony quips, \"What can I say, I happen to be an aficionado of the dive bar.\"  Le's fits that bill and is proof that just because it's a dive does not mean it can't also be a little piece of heaven."}
{"text":"A sandwich you can actually recommend to someone. If you can overcome the rough looking mini mall, Le's sandwiches and Cafe is worth stopping for. The #6 Bánh mì was delicious. It's been touted as one of the best sandwiches in the Queen City and  in my opinion, rightfully so. If you are near sugar creek and tryon, and looking for a quick bite, stop in. Support this local business owner . Cash Only"}
{"text":"Very polite man took my order. I got the pork sandwich. It was soooooo good. Definitely worth the 18 Mile drive. Price is amazing but I noticed from the previous reviews price has increased from $4 to $4 and now price is $4.25. The sandwich was perfect size for breakfast. May need to order 2 if really hungry. I will come back when in the area. The dining area is only a few tables. Most get their order to go due to spacing. The vegetables were fresh and the bread was perfect. The location is NOT good but hey I'll deal with it. :)"}
{"text":"Sugar cane juice was delicious.  I think the slice of orange detracts from the flavor, so get it without orange. Banh mi was flavorful, but I wish they would use the traditional banh mi bread."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this banh mi shop! The owners are so sweet and kind. Definitely better tasting sub sandwiches than your Subway shop. One of those hole in the wall places are the best place to eat if you could find one. Oh and it's cash only so bring cash."}
{"text":"Upon Nicole's recommendation for the best Bahn Mi's in Charlotte, I located Le's and made the trek over to this semi-abandoned strip mall. 

After ordering the #6 pork, I realized neither I nor my bf had a dime on us (only accept cash). The owner was very understanding and held our order while we took to the streets for an ATM. 

Not only were their sandwiches, coffee, and owner amazing but they had a very intriguing selection of pre-packaged goods on the counter that were very interesting to look at. 

Love having some eye-candy while I'm munching!"}
{"text":"Nicest people ever! Getting here feels like you have entered a 3rd world country (or an eerie zombie apocolypse movie), but it's soooo worth it.
I usually let them recommend a sandwich for me after I tell them what I like, and so far they haven't steered me wrong! I highly recommend the bubble tea as well, very authentic.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiched in the Queen City. Try #6. Cash ony"}
{"text":"Pay no attention to your surroundings, just order your bahn mi (the best you'll have in Charlotte) and enjoy it."}
{"text":"#1 Viet sandwich in Charlotte. I'm always scared to get shot whenever I'm at the area but it's worth it . They're always busy but they move very fast. You would have your sandwich almost immediately or within 5-10 min wait."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sandwich in the area. Once you get through the bumpy parking lot, the shop is inside the Asian Corner mall next to Dragon Court. Let me tell you, I am one to avoid parking lots if it is bad or not designed right, but I will brave this every day for the service and the sandwich. 

Fair portion at a fair price. 10/10

Just as a note, bring cash, as they do not accept card."}
{"text":"Even though the location of this place is in a very sketchy area, I'd still recommend people to come here if they want some banh mi. It is really cheap! I think they give a decent amount of meat and veggies though. They also sell Che and bubble tea! 

Beware they only accept cash! Also they only know Viet, thankfully I am Viet but those who aren't should start pointing. They do know how to say numbers though!"}
{"text":"When you first pull up this place looks really sketchy. Once you walk in and can get past the smell in the main walkway you'll find that this place is truly a hidden gem. A simple menu with different protein options helps making a selection rather easy. The bread is the authentic Vietnamese-French style bread and meat and veggies are always fresh. If you are looking to satisfy a craving this is your place."}
{"text":"Best banh mi sandwiches in Charlotte! My go to place! I love the original, sardines, BBQ pork. Everything is so good!"}
{"text":"Yet another \"OMFG this place is amazeballs\" review here. I'm not sure what I can add to what others have written, other than to say that, having spent a good amount of time in Hanoi, Le's sandwiches stack right up against the best bánh mì in that city.

The french bread is fresh and light and spongy, just as it should be in Vietnamese cooking (typical french bread is a little denser and a little crustier). The pork derived cold cuts that go into the number 8 sandwich are just right and the veggies are delightfully crunchy and mild. My companion got the number 6, which was basically a bowl of bún thit nuong (noodles with grilled pork) on a sandwich minus the fish sauce and noodles. Welp, I went up to the counter and asked for a bit of fish sauce to dip it in - the guy kind of chuckled at the idea but gave me some anyway and damned if it didn't make the number 6 better. I guess that just goes to show that you can't have thit nuong without the fish sauce. So, if you get the number 6, ask for fish sauce.

Speaking of fish sauce: holy crap, the fish sauce was good. Not too saccharine and had a good, mild anchovy flavor. Apparently it's made in-house. Not to be missed.

Alright, so you got your bánh mì and now you're looking around the shop while you're happily chomping away on your $4 sandwich. In the fridge are a bunch of Vietnamese desserts, including several varieties of chè (dessert soup made with coconut milk). If you've never had good chè before, you should absolutely try it. Then you look at the counter. WTF is that green jello looking stuff? That, my friends, is bánh da lon, a steamed layer cake made primarily with tapioca flour, mashed green beans and sugar and it is FUCKING DELICIOUS. They serve it with coconut milk-based caramel and, if you try it, you will die from excessive mouthgasms. And, at $2 per package, you have no excuse not to try it.

There are other things to get here: there are also some savory rice cakes on the counter that come with fish sauce and are equally cheap. Then there is, of course, the sugar cane juice machine, which you also must try. Fresh sugar cane juice is unlike anything else on earth: smooth, sweet and, in Vietnam, served with a dollop of lime juice.

And that completes your Le's experience. Be sure to chat up the guys behind the counter when they're not busy: they're super friendly, they're all from the same family that owns the shop, and you can learn a lot about Vietnamese food from them."}
{"text":"This place is another authentic vietamese Banh Mi sanwich shop I found in Charlotte. The parking lot of the plaza is under pretty bad condition though. It looks like a war happend there, hahaha! Anyway, Banh Mis taste good and jerkies are surprisingly good as well. Sometimes I feel bored with my lunch and will drive there grabing a sanwich. It never let me down!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go home to Louisville, I pick up a bunch of banh mi sandwiches to bring back by request. Even my dad loves them and he is the toughest critique when it comes to Vietnamese food.This place is a hidden gem tucked inside the deteriorated Asian Corner Mall that looks like it's been taken over by zombies. I have tried every single sandwich (including the sardine one finally) and you can't really go wrong with any of them. My top three favorites are:

#6 - Pork
#3 - Meatball
#11 - Vegetarian

The sugar cane drink is very refreshing. I've also had the Thai tea smoothie and that's also very good. I am hoping one day they start a food truck or food cart and come to Uptown for lunch so more people know about this place."}
{"text":"Family run, mom/pop restaurant that has been at Asian Corner for as long as I can remember.  The banhmi is solid, with special features like crispy pork belly on the weekends which is not to be missed.  Crackly crust, fresh veggies and a variety of meat offerings, this is a classic joint for pure, unadulterated Vietnamese sandwiches.  For me, there's an added charm to its rustic location.  It's a no frills, good eats place that you understand is good when people still seek it out."}
{"text":"The BEST bahn mi EVER! I have tried the vegetarian,chicken and roasted pork ones - each of them is equally amazing! It is a weekend must have for us!"}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the banh mi here as we stopped in for bubble tea and it was only so-so. We got the pina colada and strawberry slushie bubble teas and they were both icy and artificial tasting. They did not taste fresh or delicious which means they were probably made with ice, milk and artificially flavored powder instead of fresh fruit. Boba was the only option. No jelly or red bean. 

Service was friendly though very slow. Next time I'll try the banh mi but will skip the bubble tea."}
{"text":"Yep Le's is everything the Yelpers said, sketchy parking lot/building but amazingly good sandwiches and drinks. Also the owner is super nice and helpful. I asked if he had heard of the website Yelp and he had. 

To find it easier go to the entrance furthest away from North Tryon, I went in the other one and got to see some of the other business owners smoking inside the run down mall walkway, kinda weird to see that these days. Anyway Le's is all lit up and bright its kinda like a beacon in this forgotten wasteland of a mall. As I walked through, it almost felt like a movie, like a fight scene would break out at any minute!

Fade to black and enter the food...

Le knew I had never been there before and instantly suggested the #8 #6 and #2 which I'm guessing probably leans towards our American tastes? He was super nice and cheerful which was very ironic considering the dilapidation that surrounds his great little shop. I ordered the 6 & 8 and I had to try the notorious White Gourd Drink and picked up a Chrysanthemum Tea and a Mango Bubble tea. Yes the White Gourd tastes exactly like Golden Grahams! and the Chrysanthemum had a nice light flavor but nothing crazy like the gourd. The Mango bubble tea was super tasty but my wife was weirded out by the gel bubble things. Le asked if I wanted the sandwiches spicy and I consented, unsure of what I just agreed to but confident he knew what he was doing. I know that he added jalapenos but there may have been more sauce or spread of some kind? My favorite was the #8 although the #6 was just as tasty and the spice wasn't that bad, but every once in a while it would kick in!

Anyway all that together this meal for two was only about $14! This place is a screaming bargain and an amazing culinary experience! Battling the bomb riddled parking lot and mysterious smokers is just part of the adventure of Le's Sandwich shop. 

*Schwarzenegger voice*  -   I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I was craving a good Banh Mi in Charlotte and decided to come to Le's.  Despite the fact that Asian Corner Mall looks like a zombie apocalypse just came through, I really enjoyed my Banh Mi.  I ordered the #6 Thit Nuong (roast pork) and the #7 Dac Biet (combo of all deli style meats).  The roast pork was served warm, marinaded well, and was moist and not dried out.  The combo was also good and loaded with meat.  All of the meat is packed perfectly into the sandwich so you get a taste of everything in a single bite.  The daikon carrots and veggies along with the cilantro were fresh and delicious while the fresh jalapeños were really spicy.  The pate/mayo spread was flavorful, and they didn't over due it, which is a common mistake.  The bread was light and perfectly toasted. 

Overall, the Banh Mi's at Le's were very good and filling.  They're a full baguette size and for only $3.50-$4.00, they're a great deal.  You'll be more than full and satisfied after eating one of their Banh Mi sandwiches.  I would highly recommend trying one if you're looking to venture out from the typical American sub."}
{"text":"Awesome place to try Vietnamese food. Friendly service, super fresh & delicious food, and incredibly affordable (cash only). Got the pork banh mi (#6) for four dollars. Don't let the look of the shopping mall scare you (but do watch out for the potholes in the parking lot - people are not exaggerating). Check out the Asian grocery store next door too."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't going to review this place because I did not think I could add much more to what others have already stated.  But I will give it a go. Like others this gem is tucked away in a strip mall.  Don't let the other reviews deter you from coming to this place.  I stuck to my favorites the grilled pork and pork pate sandwiches...my expectations were met."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you, this had good quality sandwiches. Get the grilled pork it's my favorite. really good prices too."}
{"text":"Le's has the best grilled pork bahn mi in Charlotte that I know of. I always compare to Le's anywhere I go, and have yet to find anything to be of par or even exceed it. The shop accepts cash only and closes on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place is so popular. Le's is cornering the Charlotte market on one of the most popular sandwiches ever made: the Banh Mi. 

Not only is it complex, has an interesting history and is overall delicious, but it also has an underground cult following. From \"Battle of the Banh Mi\", celebrity chefs devoting entire episodes of their shows to the banh mi, and numerous shops in any China Town producing only banh mi, this is one of the most complex and versatile sandwiches there is... also one of the most delicious. 

Whenever I went to Boston, I would always go to one shop in China Town and stock up about 7 banh mi to take home with me (not including the one I ate there). It didn't have any sign out front, and was about as big inside as a large walk-in closet. I had been to multiple Vietnamese restaurants in the Charlotte area in hopes of finding Banh Mi or asking if they knew of a place that made them, and all I would receive is a sad shake of the head. 

Then... there was Le's. I saw it on the top restaurants in Charlotte, checked it out.... and went that day. I got three. They are delicious, the people who own the shop are great, and the sandwiches are cheap as usual. They also make delicious bubble tea (my favorite) and have some bulk items you can purchase. I just wish I lived closer so I could satisfy my cravings regularly. This is a sandwich worthy of obsession, and I've compiled a neat little history lesson, ingredients, and link to best illustrate why: 

Bánh mì [bn mi /  mî] (noun):
Arguably the best sandwich in the world, banh mi literally means bread in Vietnamese. The baguette, more specifically, was introduced to Vietnam by the French during their colonial occupation. The Vietnamese created a delicious fusion of the bread with their local flavors, much to the delight of all. 

You typical banh mi includes:

Seasoned grilled pork belly, a vinegar-based slaw made with julienned carrot, daikon, cucumber, cilantro, and an amazing sauce comprised of an amalgam of mayo, fish sauces, and spices. Other main proteins are available, such as beef, chicken, and meatball.

More complex banh mi includes the above as well as jalapenos, a special ham made with pigs ear for crunch, cha lua (steamed pork roll seasoned with fish sauce), nem nuong (minced bbq pork with sweet glaze), pickled carrots and daikon, and pork liver pate. 

A pictorial to a better understanding of the banh mi:

{"text":"After seeing so many wonderful reviews, I couldn't wait to try the #6. *snicker*

Well folks, my daughter and I rushed out to Le's last evening, after a late library run. 

The proprietors are indeed very nice people. It's possible I look like someone familiar with the language as the mom began talking to me in her dialect. She also let me taste the carrot-daikon mix when I inquired about the pickled veggies.

Thank you mom. It was my first taste of daikon and pickled veggies. Yum!

The Mr. explained that we could have our sandwich dressed there or we could have all the fixings and take it all home to assemble. He said if we took it home to make it, be sure to lightly toast the bread. Good info.

The #6 was everything everyone said it was. The only thing that could have made it better would have been cold drink to wash it down with, which we forgot to purchase in our excitement.

My daughter got the #2 (grilled chicken bahn mi) and she loved it. 

We also got a cool snack called the Sunflower Cookie. $1.75 for three (or was it four?) flower shaped confections that I couldn't get enough of. Each cookie (the taste reminded me of a cross between a fortune cookie and the fried crunchy strips you get with Chinese take out but airier and not at all greasy) is 3-4 inches across. 

Big but they're so light, you can eat several and still want more. Or maybe I'm just piggish with these things. They were just so unexpectedly good. Just the right hint of sweetness.

I have a feeling our Friday Harris Teeter sub run has now become the Friday Le's bahn mi run.

So since yesterday was Tuesday and Friday has yet to arrive, this will be a double bahn mi week for us.

I guess it would be fair to let the hubby in on our latest find."}
{"text":"Best Banh Mi in town so far. I really wish they had some other deli stuff like banh cuon or sticky rice. Still, I can't really complain about that because they're a sandwich shop that makes excellent sandwiches."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out Saturday afternoon and we liked it so much we went back Sunday!

First, cheap yep $3.50 per person. Don't be fooled by the price this isn't a child-sized portion either. 

We were able to eat there but the seating is quite limited. That being said, that particular restaurant is clean and tidy (though not much to look at), but the surrounding mall is somewhat abandoned/dirty. 

Service is super-fast ...as in 2 minutes later you will have you sandwich in hand. We couldn't bring ourselves to venture past the #6 as it was perfect. I will say it tasted better when we ate it there as the bread hardens slightly on the take-out drive home.

We had some beverage options aloe juice ( a personal favorite of mine-so refreshing), white-gourd  juice (tasted like amaretto but neither of us enjoyed it), and a strawberry sunrise bubble-tea ( I hate nesquik, and the flavor was very similar...wasn't a fan). 

We also had the sunflour cookies, which were visually appealing but skip-worthy.

I will stick to the banh-mi sandwiches and aloe juice and be on my merry way!"}
{"text":"Stop talking about this place!!!!!! 
It's amazing! It's a hidden gem that I found through Yelp but I think everyone needs to keep it our little secret. Life changing sandwiches, for real, in such a shady place
I love it. Take the far entrance, the one by Family Dollar, so you get the true experience of finding a true treat. #8 is my first favorite!"}
{"text":"Low price and absolutely WONDERFUL Bahn Mi!  Tucked away but definitely not a hidden secret.  Yelpers have raved over this sandwich and the staff is super nice.  We went with some friends and we all had the Bahn Mi (get it with the Foie Gras)... we all loved it!"}
{"text":"Le's rocks.  Unfortunately, those rocks end up in the parking lot of the mall.  If I were to put much thought into it, calling this abomination a mall is a real stretch of the imagination, because the only thing that makes it a mall is that there is one big building with some smaller shops inside.

But it is definitely worth braving that parking lot, because the place is worth the trip.  The proprietor of Le's actually started the perhaps even sketchier Thanh Huong on Central many years ago, but decided to move on, and now has this sandwich shop, focusing on what he loves: The banh mi.  Several places in Charlotte supposedly offer the simple sandwich, but when you go to order it, they are often out.

They say it is because of the bread.  Interestingly, you can actually buy the bread here at Le's for a paltry $0.60 a loaf.  Regardless, do yourself a favor and order a couple extra.  One for the ride home, one for after you get home, whatever.  That way you do not have to take a few hundred miles off the undercarriage of your car by braving the parking lot when you crave another of those awesome sandwiches.

And make sure you get one of the pressed sugar cane drinks too.  It complements the heat of the sandwich nicely, is something you cannot find anywhere else that I know about and is not nearly as sweet as you would think pressed sugar cane to taste."}
{"text":"I don't think there is a better bahn mi in Charlotte. Light crispy Vietnamese style baguettes filled with great Vietnamese cold cuts, pate, garlic mayo, pickled radish and carrot, cilantro, and fresh slices of jalapeno. (I like the #7)

The sandwiches are a great deal and my family in Raleigh asks me to bring sandwiches whenever I visit. If you are taking them to-go and not eating immediately, I'd recommend ordering the veggies on the side and adding them after toasting the sandwich. 

Like everyone says, it's in Asia Corner Mall which does not have the greatest aesthetic appeal, and the parking lot looks like its been subject to bombing for the past 10 years. If you can get past the dingy exterior, a great sandwich awaits you inside.

Also, they have bubble tea and fresh squeezed sugar cane."}
{"text":"After a long time, I finally got to try this place. As everyone said before, it's inside the Asian Corner. We drove around the parking lot, trying to find this place because I didn't pay attention to the instructions some of the reviewers gave in their reviews. I must say it was a good thing, driving around in all those bumpy potholes definitely worked up an appetite. We parked closer to the left entrance and had to walk all the way through what looked like the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. If you don't want to get spooked, walk in through the right entrance, and it will be just a few steps away.
Both me and my boyfriend had the #6 because that looked good and I had something like it before so it would be a good comparison.
[Update: Last weekend we tried #2 - chicken bahn mi and #8- BBQ pork I think. Both were really good. I liked the chicken more than #8, so my top favorites are #6 and #2.]
We got our sandwiches to-go. I tried to make small talk with the owner / manager, but he didn't seem like the friendly kind, so I gave up. Our orders were made pretty fast. We walked back out to the car, but I couldn't wait and had to eat a bite of my sandwich.... and then I just couldn't stop, but I did. We opened our sandwiches on getting home. I must say, during the 10 minute ride back home, the baguettes lost their crispiness. Even then, the sandwich was delicious, so much that I almost think of it every day. My only concern is the long bunches of cilantro they put in there. I'm all for the fantastic flavor of cilantro in my bahn mi, but at least shred it.

PS: This place is cash-only."}
{"text":"Cash only.
Great to take to go and make someone's day for lunch! I ordered the #6 and #8 - both really good. The sandwiches are flavorful and delicious. A simple thing done right!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a semi-dilapidated Asian mall on N. Tryon, this is the only reason I come back. No frills banh-mi's with some friendly people. I asked if they had fish sauce, which they typically don't provide, but they were able to accommodate and add it for mine behind the counter. I always go for the #6 (plain pork) but if you're the type, try some others: sardines, meatball, and the pork belly (if available).

Don't expect to sit inside as only 3 small tables line the small shop.. but the mall is practically empty so you can find someplace within the mall to settle in. Be prepared to bring your own water bottle to save on drinks, but the sub-$5 banh mi's is worth it.

You can also grab your Asian groceries while you're there!"}
{"text":"Yes, the location is extra sketch and the parking lot might take out one of your tires...but the restaurant is clean, the people are the nicest, and banh mi is delicious. Get the #6. Great lunch stop on the way to IKEA."}
{"text":"WOW. A tucked-away hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop in Asian Corner that will serve you some of the most delicious banh mi you will ever taste, at an extremely reasonable price!

Highlights:
-Wonderful store owner and workers
-Fresh-baked baguettes and extremely fresh ingredients
-Sandwiches range from $3-$4: buy two, take some home!
-Sandwiches made in front of your face, and fast!

The owner recommended the #6, which is their most famous sandwich. It featured grilled pork, pickled daikon and carrot, fresh cilantro, and fresh jalapenos. They added extra jalapenos once I told them I was Indian (and thus love spicy). That move stole my heart, and bumped them up to a full-on 5 star rating. Go here, you will not regret it! And do me a favor and check out the supermarket and nearby shops, they are culturally rich and worth your time as well :)"}
{"text":"Ahh-mazing!!! Thank you fellow yelpers.. You did not disappoint!! Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. I ordered the #6 grilled pork banh mi and my husband ordered the same along with an extra sardine banh mi sandwich (for $3.50 each who can resist?!) Everyone there was super friendly and welcoming and the gentleman who took our order wanted to make sure my husband knew he was ordering fish! I decided to be a little adventurous too and grabbed one if the Vietnamese canned drinks. Once the sandwiches came out  and we dug in we were impressed!! They were so delicious, fresh, and ohh the bread! This sandwich is probably the best deal for your money in all of Charlotte!!! The sardine sandwich was very good too! (You have to really like fish though!) They marinated the fish in oil and spices for a hoisin-like tasty treat. I couldn't resist and ordered a mango bubble tea for dessert..perfect way the end the meal! Couple things though...after reading the reviews on the location of this place I was a bit trepidatious but it wasn't that bad! I mean... We parked beside a Mercedes and a Porsche and their rims were still intact so it can't THAT bad. I never once felt scared.. It was actually pretty cool though because as you enter the mall you almost feel like you are transported to a different country! Oh... And make sure you bring cash! Thank goodness we happened to have a $20 in the wallet. Check this place out... You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I won't worry about going into details about the location and such for Le's since it's already been said by others. I will say I definitely never would have ventured out to find it if it weren't for the high reviews.
I ordered the #6 pork bahn mi, and it was good but not great. The pork was really tender and the pickled vegetables added solid flavor. The cilantro added another dimension to the flavor, and the jalapeno added a bit of kick. I didn't really enjoy the baguette. I'm a big fan of soft bread, and this baguette was crusty on the outside (which I don't mind) but a bit chewy in the middle. Overall, the sandwich was pretty tasty but it was too much bread and not good enough bread for me to love. For $4, it was at least a footlong sandwich though, so the value is there. 

Sandwich Taste: 7/10

{"text":"I'm so glad I finally went to Le's Sandwich Shop. While it's definitely not in the nicest area of town and the area looks pretty sketch-tastic, the sandwiches are absolutely worth the trip. 

I don't want to completely echo what all the other reviewers are saying but here's the low down:

-Incredibly friendly owner
-The sandwiches are $3 each and are damn delicious. 
-The baguettes are super fresh provide the perfect amount of toasty crisp 
-The #6 is delightful. Grilled pork, pickled veg, spicy jalapeno, bunches of cilantro, special sauce. Get one. Get two. Get three to go. 

It is the best bahn mi sammie I've had in a very long time. Even though Le's isn't much to look at, the sandwiches are unearthly good. If this place was closer to home, I'd probably set up a cot and live there."}
{"text":"They make great sandwiches.  I have been going here even before they moved to this location.  In the past, they were inside a Vietnamese grocery store.  I like there chicken sandwich and the vegetable sandwich.  The ingredients are fresh and the service is always good."}
{"text":"The experience starts in the parking lot which must feel like driving on the moon with all of its craters. Once you get parked and head inside this abandoned mall you get excited to check this place out. There are 3 ethnic grocery stores within shouting distance of this place that I wished we checked out before ordering lunch. There are 3-4 tables inside the place so planning to get it to go is a good idea and the food keeps well. 

The staff is helpful in guiding you through the small menu. Most of which is a variety of Asian cold cuts.  The 8\" sub is $3.75 and the 12\" is $4 so go big or go home. Leftovers are good. I got the 6 and the 8 both pork with the 8 being the BBQ variety. Both came with lots of veggies. Carrots, onions, cucumber, cilantro and jalapeño I think. The baguette is just perfect, crusty and skinny. The ratio of meat, veg and bread is spot on. It's spicy enough to make sure you have a bottle of water handy. Delicious. I'll be going back regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing food packed with flavor on the best baguette I've ever had., inexpensive but cash only. Great gem! Don't be scared off by the location, its definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"This is what Yelp is all about. Never in a million a years would I have ever found this spot... or even attempted to go here without reading the reviews.

I used to drive past this place all the time. I had no clue there were even businesses operating in this rundown shopping center. So I braved the parking lot, knocked the alignment out of my car probably 10 times. And it was all worth it.

For the newbies, here are some important things to know:
-You can't see Le's from the parking lot. You have to get out of your car and go inside the mall. Go past the Dollar Store at the second Asian Mall entrance. Walk through the hallway. It is on the right.
-Cash only
-They close at 6
-Seriously, the parking lot looks like a serious of bombs went off in it. Be careful driving through it.

As for the food, I knew right off the bat that I wanted the #6 grilled pork banh mi. With the prices so cheap and the fact that I survived the parking lot, I knew I wanted to order another one for later. While staring at the menu trying to decide, the super nice man behind the counter suggested the #8 BBQ pork. Oh man, delicious. The bread, the pickled veggies, the meat... both sandwiches were just fantastic. The #8 wins for me.

Two giant sandwiches... just eight bucks. You can't beat that.

Thank you Yelpers for introducing me to this small slice of Vietnamese sandwich heaven. Can't wait to go back and try the sugar cane juice!"}
{"text":"If only a sandwich shop like this existed uptown, I would have lunch here everyday.

This restaurant is essentially a small room in the Asian Corner Mall (the one further from Tryon, , not visible from the parking lot. There are maybe three or four tables there - owner and his wife were very nice. I had the #6 (grilled pork sandwich) on a baguette - was loaded with crunchy veggies and peppers too (my mouth is still searing). That and a green tea bubble tea only cost about $7 which is incredible (cash only!). Of course, there are chicken as well as vegetarian sandwiches available. This was early this Saturday afternoon so not a ton of business at that time. Also for sale there was beef jerky and rice cookies which I will have to pick up next time.

The parking lot is indeed horrendous. As for the shopping center itself, it's certainly dilapidated and aged, but it's not a spot to fear for your safety in, so don't let that deter you. Also noted that this restaurant is one of the few of its kind (i.e. counter-type grab-and-go) to not have tip jars out. Seeing as how the food was affordable and the quality excellent, I would have gladly left some dough in this instance. Anyway, the food, as well as the experience of the area itself, is worth a short expedition. Try it!"}
{"text":"Closed until 2/26 for Chinese New Year. Heard so many great things.  So excited.  Guess I will have to wait a little longer."}
{"text":"This place is so legit, especially since my old college roommate, who is Vietnamese, drives from Greensboro to buy the banh mi here. Her Mom cooks the best Vietnamese food and loves this place. 

I knew I was in for a treat when my roomie brought 4 of the banh mi for me to try. Since it was take out, the toppings (Cilantro, peppers, pickled daikon and carrots) where packaged in two separate Ziploc bags so the sandwiches wouldn't get soggy. This worked out since I didn't get a chance to try them until later that day. The banh mi were tightly wrapped and numbered on the outside. There was one #1, #9, and two #10. My brother had the #1 and #10 while I had to rest. The #10 was the classic pork and the #9 was the sardine. Sardine banh mi is my favorite and their version was the best I've had. The sardine is not covered is sauce but instead crispy flakes (I think onion) that added additional crunch. The bread is fresh, thin, with a crispy outside and chewy inside. I like how the bread is in proportion to the filling unlike other places where it's too thick and drowns out the other ingredients. And yes, I have bit my tongue before trying to chew through a thick banh mi baguette at a different place in Chicago (not a good idea to eat one after a dental procedure when you can't feel your face let alone your tongue...it required several stitches). I digress. The classic pork was just as good. We both inhaled both banh mi in one sitting...a feat for me who is used to eating just one at a time.

So happy to have a go-to banh mi place whenever I visit Charlotte. Can't wait to come back and actually visit the store and order for myself."}
{"text":"These bahn mi's are delicious! I tried the pork belly one and had a bite of a sliced pork one and both are great with lots of flavor.  I'm not sure how they found such spicy jalapeños for them, but those plus the fresh cilantro are great on the sandwiches. 
Also recommend trying the sugar cane juice, they make it right there behind the cash register and it's delicious as well. 
Super cheap and filling meal for lunch or dinner! 
Recommend taking it to go though."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place when I shop at the little grocery store all the time? I was craving for a Viet Sub and found this place on Yelp. With all the positive reviews, we gave this place a try and OMG, I am definitely coming back. We ordered #6, 7 & 8. My favorite is 6 (grilled pork) and after eating just that sandwich, I made my husband go back for another one cause one was definitely NOT enough. 

I also got a coconut boba and it was delicious. My little girl didn't even want to share!!

The place looks beat but don't worry. Just go inside the Asian Corner Mall and to your right, the restaurant is there and they ONLY TAKE CASH."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and super cheap. I had to get mine Togo to bring to Columbia SC and they packed the veggies separately for me when I told them I'm not eating them right away. The people working are so nice and honest. This place is the number one spot for banhmi in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. I've been to Lee's 5 or 6 times now, and every time I get near this side of town, my mouth starts watering. Absolutely hands down the best banh mi sandwich you'll find in Charlotte in my opinion. And at around 4.50 a pop, you can get like 10 of them. The BBQ pork is amazing, but my favorites are the lees special and the pork pate. All the textures together are just insane. The bread is warm and thin crusted. Bottles of sriracha to spice it up yourself. I have never left hungry or disappointed, ever. And I'm a critical jerk. Aside from the flavor party that will happen in your mouth, Mr. Lee, ever present behind the register, is always kind and helpful especially with new customers. And the place is spotless. 
It's a very small, one room operation with 2 or 3 tables, so most orders are to go. If you've never been to the Asian mall, you're missing out. Don't be offput by the rough exterior and pothole parking lot, treasures abound inside."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious....  very authentic and original...   not a fancy place but you will not care because the sandwiches are delicious... CASH ONLY!!!   I can't wait or come back...."}
{"text":"Excellent whole in the wall Banh Mi sandwich shop.   You gotta enter the little mall and its on your right.  They only accept cash.  The staff is nice.  Thai tea with bubbles was good but the frozen smoothie kind not iced kind.  The sandwich it self was amazing and for the price you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best bahn mi in Charlotte.  Bring cash and watch for potholes.  Le and his family are very nice and make one delicious sandwich.  Get the grilled pork- best by far!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem of Charlotte.  Get a sandwich and a sugar cane drink. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Best banh mi in Charlotte! It's located inside this shopping center, and I'm not going to lie, I am scared to be in this center alone so I usually power walk to Le's once I'm out of my car. (It's really not that bad, I'm just easily scared.)

#6 is the best sandwich ever. It is their grilled park banh mi. I usually buy more than one because it's THAT good and only $4 for one. 

Tips:
1. Avoid the potholes in the parking lot and drive slow.
2. Bring cash because I don't think they accept card.
3. Try everything! 
4. Tell your friends about this place, the man behind the counter is so sweet!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite banh mi shop in Charlotte. I grew up eating these and they've always tasted wonderful. The other banh mi shops can try but they can't even compare to Le's . In my opinion the  banh mi at the other shops taste really Americanized and are also overpriced. The quality is always good here and so is the service. Cheaper than the other places too. The owners are really nice as well. Highly recommended! *****"}
{"text":"I didn't think I liked Vietnamese hoagies until I tried this place! Wow really good the best. The parking lot is like a combat zone but worth it"}
{"text":"Since this is my first banh mi, I don't have any comparison, what I do know is that I'm hooked on this sandwich.

Read the other reviews about the terrible parking lot, and the general condition of the venue.  I won't flog that already deceased equine.

Once you find this place, it nearly sparkles in comparison to the rest of the surroundings.  It seems pretty clean and bright.  The ladies behind the counter were very nice and helpful, though they only speak enough English to take your order.  The main menu is in Vietnamese, but there is a picture menu on the wall that has some English on it.  Clientele was mostly Asian but there were several in the fairly large crowd that looked like me.  We all smiled a lot at each other and the experience was very pleasant.

I went with the classic number 6 with added pate.  I can only say, wow.  Now I know what all the hoopla regarding banh mi has been about.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the bread is sublime.  I don't know what you call it. They list it as baguette but it is unlike any baguette I have ever had, shatteringly crisp but very tender and fluffy all at the same time.  The pork was flavorful and tender as well and the pate was a great addition, salty, porky, livery, and peppery.  I loved the lightly pickled vegetables and thought they added just the right balance with the cilantro.  

This is a sandwich worth going out of your way to find and enjoy.  All the crazy adventure that you have to endure to get this little piece of Vietnamese culinary heaven just makes the enjoyment all the more worthwhile.

Don't miss the opportunity to broaden your horizons, if you can't make it to Vietnam, at least try to get to Le's sometime soon."}
{"text":"Wow!!! One of my Top 5 Restaurants now. The food was amazing! Very fresh and delicious. I ordered the #6 Banh Mi Thijt Nuong Baguette and it was crazy good. This place is in a run down strip mall but its way worth the trip. You gotta try this place if you're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie...this place is in a weird location.  I mean weird.  I was a little apprehensive about even going in.  My friend ordered for me and let me try her sandwich, because I have no clue as to what I should order or what I may like.  She ordered the traditional cold cut bahn mi.  I honestly thought it looked kind of boring and so I only tried hers to get an idea of what these little sandwiches were all about, what the craze was all about.  I'd have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  It was pretty good!  I liked the veggies on top, which I didn't expect to enjoy.  Overall, very delicious and I would definitely go back for more.

The service was good.  The shop is inside a mall with many Asian stores.  I wasn't fond of the area and probably would have never tried this place if my friend didn't take me in.  The actual sandwich shop was neat and clean.  I heard they make fantastic cane sugar drinks as well!  I will be having one at my next visit for sure."}
{"text":"Le's specializes in Banh Mi, which is a type of vietnamese sandwhich and it's amazing.  It's served on a french baguette and it's stuffed with lightly pickled vegetables (carrots and radishes?), the meat is super flavorful.  I've tried 2 or 3 and can't really tell them apart.  There aren't a whole lot of non-vietnamese people that venture into this area so the proprietor is incredibly friendly.  Just tell him you want 2 of his most popular sandwhich - he'll charge you next to nothing and you'll be on your way.  The toughest part is getting there before they close, if only they'd stay open a little later - even just one night a week.  Come on Le, stay open until 7 at least on Friday!!

When you drive to the area you'll see a strip mall that looks straight out of a third world country.  The potholes are anywhere from 1-2 feet deep, I'm not kidding.  Once you navigate to a safe parking spot, the restaurant is INSIDE the mall - there are two entrances.  You'll know the Le's because it's the only business still running on the inside part.

After you've left Le's, there are a few other things worth exploring.  Both asian groceries are kinda cool - cheap produce and meats, strange canned and frozen goods.  It's hit or miss, worth working around though.  There's also a restaurant supply store that I highly recommend you check out.  I know it sounds strange, but they sell things I've never seen before.  Trust me, if it's open, just explore it for a few minutes, you guys'll find it entertaining at the least.  :)"}
{"text":"Good food and cheap prices! Bring cash. I've had Bahn-mi that cost twice as much with more meat, but I prefer Le's $4 sandwiches. The only con: they don't sides sides and the sandwich is a tad small. Offering a bag of chips would be perfect-if they had them."}
{"text":"Best Bahn Mis!!! Simple and perfect, don't pass this place up! If you don't  loose your car in a pot hole in the parking lot, you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Try the meatball banh mi. It was surprisingly good with nice spice."}
{"text":"The location is rough but SO WORTH IT. With multiple closed stores and a pothole riddled parking lot, you'll think you're in the wrong place. Walk inside the large, Asian market storefront and turn right at the empty fountain. You're sure to find a line out the door waiting for Le's famous sandwiches! Cash only.

Crispy, savory, and delicious! Great fresh bread, insanely awesome marinated meat, vinegary crunchy carrots and onions, spicy sriracha. A perfect combination! I ordered the #6 which is pork but they also offer other meats. $4.25 what a deal! I tummy was happily full all day. I would like to try the other sandwiches but honestly the pork is just so incredible I can't stop thinking about getting another."}
{"text":"First, a customer service story.  I went there last Saturday for the first time.  The place is in a sketchy area and is a little hard to find.  You have to enter the \"mall\" go down and it is on your right (A little tip.  If you are looking at the building from the Sugarcreek side there looks like there are two entrances.  Go to the one on the right.  About 2/3 of the way down.  The one on the left is locked) So, I go in on Saturday and get a couple of sandwiches.  I went with #6, and the owner (a very nice, helpful man and I am ashamed I don't know his name) suggested #7 and #8.  I took them over to a friends and went in.  I could not find my phone anywhere.  I borrowed my friends and started dialing.  No answer.  Walked out to my car and repeated the process.  No answer.  I knew I had it with me at the restaurant because I had used the navigation app to get there.  I freaked out.  I figured I might have dropped it in the parking lot and if you know where that is I figured my phone was now probably dialing every country in the United Nations and I would be receiving a huge bill on my next billing statement.  I jumped in the car and hauled ass over there and ran in.  I asked if I had left my phone.  He said no, I saw you leave with it.  I went back out and scoured the parking lot and no luck.  I figured it was gone.  When I got home I got my phone and called again and this time I heard a faint ring.  Somehow the phone had been wedged in the car seat and I did not hear it or it did not ring.   Christmas had come early.  My entire life (what little there is) was on that phone.  I was totally relieved.  So I go back in on Sunday around noon (I had been craving them again since my first bite of one)  and the place is jammed packed.  There must be 20 people in front of me and the nice owner is taking orders and is clearly busy.  He spies me in the back and says \"did you find your phone?\"  I told him I did and I appreciated him asking.  He smiled and said \"I am glad. I knew you left with it.\" and went back to ringing up the orders.  In this day and age it is so rare to get customer service.  Totally impressed me.  

Ok now about the food----I could eat at this place everyday.  I could eat them for breakfast.  They are all fabulous but I have to say that the #8 is my fave.  Coldcuts.  I don't know what but they are good.  The pickled veggies are awesome the fresh herbs on top (mint? and cilantro?) are a brilliant touch.  I have had Bahn Mi a couple times before but nothing that rivaled this.  The bread is spectacular.  I ordered five sandwiches and a coffee and the bill was just north of $20.  Are you kidding me?  What a bargain.  I took the sandwiches over to my buddy and his wife's house for football Sunday and we cut them up and everyone had some of each.  They all echoed my sentiments.  My buddy's wife's friend called me the next day and asked me the address and name of the place.  She does not live here but she said she had to go there as soon as she comes back to visit her family. She could not stop raving about them."}
{"text":"Prices are fair $3.25 for either the grilled chicken or pork, freshest sandwich I have ever had!"}
{"text":"If you can swerve the potholes in the parking lot and don't make eye contact with anyone in the parking lot, then you'll find a gem that even a native Charlottean has never been to until now. Coconut bubble tea and a number 6 made my day. Love this place already."}
{"text":"Far back corner of the mall/lot. Head for Dragon Court Chinese Restaurant.

Absolutely the best banh mi I've had outside of Vietnam. The space isn't much to speak of, but it's clean and well-lit, and the mall literally looks like a horror movie set, but THE SANDWICHES!"}
{"text":"Delish! Definitely my go-to Banh Mi place when I visit Charlotte.  The #1 combination sandwich is my favorite! The taro bubble tea there is yummy too! Keep up the good work Le's sandwiches :)"}
{"text":"I have never had a Bahn Mi sandwich and this was excellent.  The restaurant is definitely a hole in the wall but the staff was extremely nice and welcoming.  The sandwich to order is the #6.  The veggies are super fresh, with savory pork on a toasted baguette.  It's fantastic until you bite into the large slice of jalapeño ...ouch! I also ordered the Vietnamese coffee, wow, does that pack a punch of caffeine, so naturally I loved it!  I would highly recommend Le's to any person looking to experience a different side of Vietnamese cuisine outside of Pho."}
{"text":"Finally made it back when they had sugar cane juice. Definitely worth getting, especially if you've never had it. It's pleasantly sweet, with a citrusy aftertaste that's perfect for cooling the August heat (or the heat from the hot peppers on your sandwich)"}
{"text":"The shopping mall that this place is in is seriously scary.  I nearly forgot that I was in the United States and not some war ravished country.  

You really can't beat the bang for the buck here.  The sandwiches are dirt cheap and high quality.  Do I think it's the best sandwich in town?  No, definitely not.  Is it high quality, tasty, and great bang for the buck?  Absolutely!  

Le's is worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Best one in Charlotte. Steamed pork with pork skin is my favorite combo. The warm buttery texture of the pork gives it a more savory finish."}
{"text":"Really good banh mi
Have not tried taro bubble tea yet 
Will. Need to try their banh chung once tet comes around"}
{"text":"oh, that crispy baguette, the delicious pork, those fresh crunchy vegetables... and a bouquet of cilantro.  for $3.50??

I've been sold on the #6, the grilled pork, but last time I tried the #1 (with three types of pork) and I might have a hard time ordering something different form now on. Amazing. (Though as awesome as the flavors are alone, I'm such a condiment queen I have to squeeze some hoisin sauce onto it when I get home.) They also offer just vegetables and a grilled chicken options, among a few others. 

Also, as much as I didn't want to think about mayo being spread on the baguette in the past, a tablespoons worth in my last few bites made me face the facts- I'm not really eating as healthy as I was telling myself I was, but hey, it's still a better option than some lunches (and they're more than happy to make it without)

The husband and wife duo are adorable, and it seems only the man speaks english as the woman always slides to the side when I walk in. He's always curious about what I've purchased next door at the market and is incredibly friendly. Along with sandwiches they also sell some sausages, rice cakes, beef jerky, and lots of candied items. 

Do not miss it! I went to the market for months without knowing this place was just behind it, and then was a little unsure about whether or not to try it - but do yourself a favor and go! and yes, beware the parking lot!"}
{"text":"This place has the best banh mi sandwiches in Charlotte, hands down. Their bubble tea is pretty solid as well. We asked one of the employees for their best sandwiches and received the numbers 6, 7, and 12. Personally, I thought the number 6 was the best. It is a best seller for a reason. It had the perfect amount of spice and the baguette was light and crispy like a proper banh mi should be. Go. It is worth it."}
{"text":"The best Banh Mi sandwiches in Charlotte!!! You have to brave through the parking lot from hell but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches in this place are really good it's in a old mall, but a good place for a quick pick up."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!  Great staff with a very friendly attitude and extremely helpful. Don't be fooled by the area, its in the mall at the end on the left and it's legit!  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"They have the best sandwich around. I always get the number 1 combination just because i believe that it taste excellent. I've had a lot of banh mi but i still believe it is the best"}
{"text":"Always get the #6 and #8...Tried the sandwiches at other locations, and the only other comparable one is up in Mooresville, but I can't remember the name.  But still, Le's is by far the best in town.

I know everyone writes about the parking lot, but I was there yesterday and want to give a little up date.  It appears they are working on the lot and the area in front of the Asian market has been repaved and the other areas look like they are filling in the potholes.  Seems like they may be doing a little facelift of the area!  YAHOO!

Don't be afraid to go.  I have never experienced any issues by going there by myself!"}
{"text":"I'll pile on the accolades as well. This place is amazing!! It's inside the old Asian mall, and they only take cash (but there's an ATM inside the mall if you forget). The service was great - everyone was super friendly, and our sandwiches were prepared very quickly. Great portions for the price, as well. 

Some of the best bahn mis I've had. The bread is fresh and delicious, the meat is cooked to perfection, and the veggies are crisp and add the perfect crunch to the sandwich. Definitely recommend to others, and I'll be back asap. Possibly daily..."}
{"text":"Banh mi. Go eat one. Or two.

Happy news: they have a vegetarian option. 

\"It looks like meat...not meat. Tofu.\" And it's not a wimpy sandwich. From my observation, the regular banh mi sandwiches are also worth your while. Make sure to request the sandwich on a baguette and ask for pate. 

Yes, you must have cash. Yes, the parking lot is atrocious. Yes, they close early.

Just go.

Yelp again doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Don't let the war torn exterior fool you.  This place is legit.  Go get one.....now."}
{"text":"I'm all about some good quality food ESPECIALLY when it's under $5!! Le's is a little hard to find. If you survive the parking lot and massive pot holes. Walk in to the entrance next to the grocery store. Le's is down the entry way on the right. Don't be turned off by the somewhat abandoned insides. Le's is the definition of a local business and I look forward to supporting them as long as I'm in Charlotte!

I usually go for the pork, but the chicken is good too!"}
{"text":"We've thus far had many a take-out experience here and never once has it fallen short of incredible! 

Everything is so incredibly fresh, seasoned and delicious!

This is a must go to place for an incredible sandwich that is diff from the norm! 

YUM"}
{"text":"Well, I have nothing to compare these to since they are the only Bahn mi I've had. They are just great sandwiches. I love Vietnamese flavors. I always go for the #6 pork. It's just perfect. Meat is flavorful, raw veggies are crisp and fresh and the bread...oh, the bread!  Squirt on some Sriracha and I'm a happy girl. 
I've tasted my hubby's #4 shredded pork and pork skin but I still favor the #6. 
The bubble teas are very good. Tasted the mango and was impressed. Really want to try the sugar cane juice bubble tea as I grew up drinking raw sugar cane juice in my hometown, Miami. We call it guarapo and it's delicious!  I was elated to find that this kind of drink exists in Charlotte.  
Do note: this bright and very clean little cafe dwells inside the most rundown, smelly, abandoned mall I've seen.  It looks like the remains of a bombed area. I'm not sure how best to describe it but the entrance to the mall smells like urine and cigarettes sometimes. But don't let that scare you. This place is a must try.  Regardless of its location, it's a gem.  
Oh, and take cash. No CC accepted."}
{"text":"Move over subways and hoagies, make way for banh mi. This is a wonderful little place located in the Asian Corner mall. You'll have to navigate the gauntlet of vietnamese shops, and walk through all the indoor smoking and fishy smell to find it .... but it's worth the effort. I recommend the #1 and #6 but looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"Wow. When I first showed up, I almost left. Park at the far end near the International Supermarket. Go inside, look right, and the pearling gates will be beaming. 

1) The sandwiches are incredible. bread is fresh, meat is seasoned and cooked to perfection, and all the veggies are so fresh they should still have roots on them. 

2) I always go for the Number 6. 

3) Don't ignore the snacks or beef jerky. I swear his curry beef jerky is the greatest thing I've ever tasted. The crunchy rice treats are delicious as well.

4) $!! One $. Such a value. 

Don't be scared off by the outside. This is a must try."}
{"text":"Do you scrounge up couch change just to pay for a burger? Are you tapping into the kiddies' piggy banks to buy that happy meal? Are you looking for Charlotte on the cheap and incredibly tasty? Are you tired of Apollo Ono and Jared? Need a change of pace? Are you looking to be a little adventurous? Want to live outside of your comfort zone and live and eat on the edge?

I just might have the remedy for your dilemma. For a measly $4, not only will you be treated to a sizeable foot long of fresh, earthy, orgasmic gastro explosions of exotic flavor; you will also be transported to a wondrous off road journey into the urban jungles of an era reminiscent of a once glorious ethnic mecca.

Cash only and 5th degree black belt not required...well unless you want to protect that cash in your pockets. Or you can just hide it in your sock. 

Just kiddin'......It might look ghetto, but it's perfectly safe."}

I enjoy the barbeque one and the pork one especially, they're really great and tastes even better with a bubble tea (my favorite or either green tea or Thai tea)! I have been living in Charlotte my whole life and I always got excited every time I go to Asian Corner Mall because of Le's sandwiches and the bubble tea. This place is really popular, considering the area seems a bit sketched or run down from the outside. They don't accept cards and you can only pay with cash!"}

My pregnancy last year made me desperate enough to have someone mail me some until I was told to go to Le's.  I almost died when I took my first bite of the banh mi there. Crunchy pickled daikon, cukes, and carrots, bright green cilantro and jalapenos, toasty baguette, and a yummy pate and mayo spread.  Made to order right in front of you, many varieties to choose from, very friendly owners, and just absolutely fresh and delicious banh mi every time I go there.  It does not get any better than this, at least in NC."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I think anyone that walks in the front door can be a little overwhelmed especially if you're there at a busy time. It is well worth The trip! You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches my favorite is the one with the headcheese but I only recommend that people who are willing to push the boundaries of food! You must try this."}
{"text":"I finally am catching up with my reviews after making Le's a semi-regular lunch spot, thanks to Tony C's favorable recommendation.  By now, you have read all about the location, tucked away in what looks to be a dying mall in dire need of renovations where even the parking lot is scattered with weeds growing in between the cracks.

Despite the rundown setting, Le's Sandwiches & Cafe serves up great sandwiches.  Fresh bread, good veggies and friendly service.  This is probably the most authentic Vietnamese food establishment I've seen in Charlotte.  I always go for the white ham and pate sandwich.  You can order the bread regular or \"long\" baguette style.  

For those of you new to banh mi, the bread is light and crisp, you can choose your meat and all come with pickled daikon and carrot slices, cilantro and peppers - a surprising taste combination that is simply excellent.  (Take the peppers out unless you like really spicy food; they are hot.)

The Vietnamese coffee here is just OK, a bit on the pricey side (I'm used to paying $1.50), a little too dark for me (I've had better), but I must urge you all to try this place.  I tried the Bubble Tea (Green Tea Latte with Boba) - well made, but the boba was a tad hard here and there.

Still Le's is quite the find and is the only place I go to out here to fix my Banh Mi craving.  And now, I must footnote to say that if you are in So Cal, go to Banh Mi Che Cali for the best sandwich ever. But, at Le's you can just get a glimpse of what a great Vietnamese sandwich is like."}
{"text":"I love bahn mi's. I love authentic & traditional bahn mi's. With that being said, I was skeptical. But this place does not disappoint. It is a treasure, one to be enjoyed at much as possible.

The service here is fast and friendly. There isn't much competition for bahn mi's in the queen city but they do stand out to other bahn mi's I have had across the glorious US. 

If you go, do yourself and get one for later. They are delicious and your belly will thank you! You can also buy beef jerky, pickled veggies, viet desserts/drinks and other random surprises depending on your visit."}
{"text":"Great service every time we have come. Sandwiches always taste really fresh. Lots of really great choices. Cash only."}
{"text":"Not much needs to be said about this place other then it is by far a hidden gem in the Charlotte culinary scene. And when I say hidden, I truly mean hidden. It might take a little bit to find, being located deep in the Asian market, but the treasures you'll find are well worth the search.

With foot-long sandwiches costing just $3.75 (including tax), it is hard to comprehend the freshness at that price. With each bite it's the perfect marriage of fresh crunchy vegetables and perfectly seasoned meat. Each sandwich is phenomenal and should be tried at least once. 

But the food is not the only thing that makes the place great, the gentleman who owns it and the staff that work and are some of the most cheerful individuals you will find throughout Charlotte.

But no review would be complete for this place without telling you that the BREAD is the true hero of this place!"}
{"text":"I loved to Charlotte from San Diego six years ago and I'm glad to say that this shop is wonderful.  It's like a trip back to some of the restaurants we have back home. I'm originally from the San Francisco/Sonoma County area and it is actually better than some of the places there."}
