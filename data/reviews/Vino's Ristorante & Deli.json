{"text":"I went here with 2 of my friends. It is clean and service was good but the food was disgusting. We all got different dishes and none of liked it. My sauce tasted like it was chef boyardee canned sauce. Would not recommend this place if you have taste buds."}
{"text":"After first eating at Vino's in September 2011, and enjoying a true 5-star experience, we decided to return in September 2012 during our annual Las Vegas vacation.  The experience was a complete reversal from the previous year, and Vino's has been removed from our dining list.  To start, when we arrived at 7:00pm there were only a few other diiners in the restaurant, but we were seated at the far back corner of the restaurant, next to the door going into the kitchen.  Our own fault for not requesting to be moved, but the location wouldn't have been that bad except for the fact that a few minutes later, a group of three drunken construction workers were seated at the table next to us.  Trying to have a peaceful dinner and a normal conversation was impossible with the loud, drunk, oobnoxious comments coming from the next table.  My dining companion and I are both middle-aged, and were dressed nicely, especially for the fact that this is a restaurant in a casino, and other diiners were in t-shirts and shorts.  Why we were placed in the back?  Who knows.  As for the food, one of our orders was for veal parm, and we received chicken parm instead.  The portions were much, much smaller than a year earlier, and unfortunately the flavor was lacking as welll.  Not that the food tasted bad, but it was nothing exceptional, and the red sauce tasted just like a jar of Ragu.  Lastly, the server lost our restaurant.com certificate.  There are tons or restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you're in the mood for Italian food, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  We will be."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Nice atmosphere. Great prices. Would recommend to anyone. Had the chicken Parmesan and the lemon cello cake. So good."}
{"text":"Our server was knowledgeable, attentive, and on-point. Didn't miss a beat. I'd give him 5 stars.   The food was slightly above average, with both dishes on the salty side, especially the seafood risotto.  I would go back if I was in the casino and wanted an Italian dinner. But I wouldn't go out of my way.  This is one of those places that will do if you're nearby and want what's on their menu, but otherwise you wouldn't go there."}
{"text":"A restaurant located in a dump of a casino named The Cannery. Service was very attentive. Please don't introduce yourself and say \"hey guys\". This isn't TGIFridays. Garden salad fed two, but not impressive. Hubby's chicken Parmesan wasn't too bad. I ordered chicken Sambaltica. Yucky. Wasn't pan seared, and came with a sauce that drowned it terribly. Sent it back to be cooked correctly, and it came back exactly the same. Ate the complimentary bread and martinis instead. Don't go without a coupon.  We didn't have one, and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices and great ambiance.  I would strongly suggest ordering the Veal Scallopini with Marsala Mushrooms, as it is simply delicious. I wish I had room for the Cannoli, but I was stuffed lol Will I come back? You betcha. I can't wait lol"}
{"text":"We usually love this place. Made a reservation for 6:00 to get to a 7:30 movie with the kiddo. Upon arriving at 5:55, we were told that although we had a reservation there would be a 15 to 20 minute wait. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Inexperienced and flustered hostess, who exuded frustration. Told us the wait was 30 minutes to an hour.  So we went to the bar with menus, whereupon the bartender informed us the restaurant was slammed and we might have to wait over an hour.  We told him we only wanted 2 bowls of soup.  He said,  \"I'm just saying you might not get before 8pm.\" It was 7pm. I said, we'll get pizza next door. Which we did and watched through the window while at least 2 to 3 tables sat empty for the 30 minutes we were there.  Food might be good, but I will never know with poor customer service ljke that."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for some dinner.  Started off with some calamari and stuffed mushrooms.  The calamari was done perfectly and the marinara sauce was good.  The stuff mushrooms were in a garlic/herb cheese sauce that was excellent.  She had the risotto and I had the seafood cioppino that was pretty good also.  Service was good also as the waiter was very attentive.  We will come back and try more dishes for sure."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best cheesecakes I've had in a long while! The steak just melts in your mouth and the service is top notch! I think it's North Las Vegas best kept secrets. A great place for a date night on a budget"}
{"text":"the restaurant is located in the rear of the cannery casino, across from the sports book. there is a cute dining piazza and full service bar in the front..  atmosphere is peaceful and decorations are elegently  italian. the menu is a large selection of very italian dishes .once you are seated, breadsticks, oil & balsamic vinegar arrive and  are replenished gladly. the food is good. the service is good. drink refills are plentiful. my wife and i have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this for some time so we finally made it. The restaurant was clean and open and nice. The food was good but a little on the pricy side. The chicken vesuvio was very good. The staff was EXCELLENT!  Everyone was very helpful and attentive and met all of our needs. This is a 3 star restaurant but I give it 4 stars because of the staff."}
{"text":"I don't want to even give them a full star rating. Servers were nice. Wait time for food after ordering was 45 mins. They weren't busy and still waited forever. Salad was super watery and barely any dressing. Ordered spaghetti and meatball and also a shrimp Alfredo. Meatball was flavorless and noodles over cooked. Alfredo was super thick and tasted like it was from a can. Paid $4 extra for only 3 small shrimps in the Alfredo. Breadsticks were the only good thing to eat. Had to ask for refills of soda and water. Will never return here. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband & I love this restaurant the service is amazing! And the food is out of this world I love their pasta especially lasagna and chicken Alfredo it so delicious I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an out of this world Italian Restaurant, go here! You will not regret it!  Visited here on 9/10/16 with my bf as we were leaving from the Harvest Festival and happened to be in the area, SO glad we picked here instead of Olive Garden or any other place for that matter. EXCELLENT SERVICE, FOOD, AMBIANCE! Ordered 2 orders of their homemade lasagna and breadsticks, best we HAVE EVER HAD.  Chelsea was our main server and was beyond  awesome, as well as the other servers, and manager. Leaving after paying $50, with 3 to-go boxes, and smiling faces. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great cuisine and really attentive staff. Greg the manager is very accommodating and the Italian food is the real deal."}
{"text":"Server was awesome but overwhelmed because he was doing it all.  Food was mediocre at best, seafood was cold and chewy. An unfortunate experience."}
{"text":"The hostess was friendly and greater me with a genuine smile. The service was great. My waiter, Greg, checked on me often. The wine selection was good with lots of glass and Bottle options.  My dinner was chicken saltimbocca and not as good as I expected.  It was drowned in oil and gravy along with everything else on my plate. It tasted okay but the presentation was disappointing. Oddly enough, I felt I was in an episode of restaurant impossible.  I would recommend the restaurant but with a few tweaks it could be great."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. Seated at 7:15. Order taken around 10 minutes later. Received food at 8:10. Food was just ok but not worth waiting 45 minutes for. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We try this place every few months just cause when u watch a movie at the cannery, the options are limited...and every time, it has horrible food and worse service..."}
{"text":"Had a couple of hours to kill and wasn't sure what or where to eat before watching a movie so we checked out what was on tap in the casino. Our choice was Vino Italian dining.  So this has 2 parts, a dine in sit down experience and a what to seem from outside a pizza take away.  No real reservation was required. We walked in and we're sat down to a casino style or standard Italian decor setting. The dress code was casual, so ladies leave your cocktail dresses at home, and fellas that bow tie you wanted to wear won't do you any justice here.  The menu was your typical run of the mill american Italian dishes that neither disappoints nor gets your belly rumbling.  We had unlimited garlic bread which seemed to be pretty fresh. And the glasses of wine were a heavy pour. (Smiley face)  Ordered the pork stuffed shells. Now this wasn't a bad dish, it had some great flavor and interesting sauce that may have been made in house.   A couple of Knocks on this place was the food was so hot when it came out, the sauces were still boiling on our dishes. We had to wait 15 minutes or so to even try it. So that was a little bummer.  I can't give this place 5 stars, it isn't the worlds best Italian restaurant but if you have 3 star expectations, this place ain't a bad selection if your looking in the casino with half decent prices."}
{"text":"My husband lives the fettuccini Alfredo. The food is decent the breadsticks are great. Good for a 2:1 coupon dinner."}
{"text":"I eat at Vino's once a week, with friends like the stuffed pork shells, salads, and pizza served to my table.  the personal always friendly and pay attention. Larry L Hawks"}
{"text":"At first glance of the inside, the restaurant looks like a diner, not very romantic for a dinner date.  The breadsticks were good with the oil and vinegar dipping sauce, but even better with the stuffed mushroom sauce.  We usually order the stuffed mushrooms if a restaurant serves it, and for $9, they gave only 4 mushrooms (compared to Olive Garden and Red Lobster 6 at same price).  The servers were friendly and helpful, they kept checking on us and advising us of our food wait time.  I had the baked Manicotti, it was cheesy and delicious.  We saved room for desert and enjoyed the Tiramisu, it was very good. I gave 4 stars for taste and service, it was only the atmosphere and appearance that lost a star."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Showed up at 5 pm when they opened. A huge line only one server. Don't go to this place!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The manager was pleasant. The waitstaff, however, were neglectful for the most part.   Look, I know restaurant.com coupons suck for you guys. However, they also come included with an automatic 18% gratuity. This does NOT mean that you may ignore us, simply because we're a group of three young guys.   When the restaurant is empty, it shouldn't take more than thirty minutes to get food. Nor should it take 10-15 minutes to get a refill on our water. Our server seemed more than eager to get us out as soon as things were done as well.  The food's about the equivalent of Olive Garden food. I've had better, and I've had worse. Won't be going back, though. Normally I tip additional on top of the 18% when I use those coupons, however, when I'm treated like I was, you're lucky I didn't scratch off the 18% as well."}
{"text":"I didn't really gin\"in\" the restaurant...I had dinner at their bar just outside the door. I had the chicken milanese and it was delish. Ok, so it won't compete with a 5-star, but I'm at the Cannery waiting for my movie to start and I'm very pleasantly surprised at the goodness. And it's price worthy. Not to mention the great service. I will make this a regular dinner place when I come for the movies."}
{"text":"My name is Carl Taylor, cards number 20090. In my opinion Vino's restaurant is the best, Waverly's used to be the best.  Greg the manager a super manager, he will make sure you have a delicious meal and your service is the best.  I must say this when ever I have dinner Greg is always present and he makes sure my needs are taken care of, not only mine but everyone else. I my be wrong but it seems like the other restaurants have floating manager.  I had a very bad experience at Waverly's my guest and I were served a meal the was not palatable, we were served another meal that tasted horrible.  No manager on site two days later I talked to Steve the Executive Chef. I have been member of the Cannery every since it open and my desire is to continue to be a member.  Thank you.  Carl Taylor"}
{"text":"first of all let me start with the manager, he is great always polite and accommadating, i have dealt with all of their waiters and they are great. now for the food it is fantastic, no matter what we order it is great, its the only place that serves shrimp and veal parmesan. if you want great atmosphere, great service, great food and a place that the manager makes you feel family then Vino's is the place. i love it"}
{"text":"I don't know if our server was new or what but the experience I had here was terrible. Those lady's who come around filling drinks and bread were on it but our server was awful. He got my order wrong and the food took WAY too long to where we almost missed out movie. It wasn't even busy. But we had to get it to go because we were running short on time. My friends were highly upset and so was I."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, reasonably priced, and hot. The service was terrible the last 2 trips here. The servers need some serious training: no upselling techniques, no personality, seem rushed, etc..."}
{"text":"My fam love this place. We always feel at home and welcomed. My boys' favorite is the steak abruzzo while mine is the shrimp and lobster fra diavollo. I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"We had a truly delightful time in this restaurant. After our movie we stopped for dinner and a drink.  Carly, the bartender made us beautiful martinis and very graciously shared some of her favorite dishes from the menu. Once we were seated, Gregory provided us with attentive and knowledgeable service and our food choices were excellently prepared. We cannot wait to return. VINO'S is a gem."}
{"text":"THis is my first Yelp review.  We have been eating at Vino's about every other week for the past couple years. We find the food to be very good and very reasonably prices.  However, it is the small details that often make you think.  She forgets the appetizer, this dish comes out with potatoe instead of the pasta you asked for.  Wheres the extra sauce?? A long wait for refills. We always ask for Sheri, she is quite efficient, but loves to chat up all her tables and can be slow in taking care of another table. All of the pastas here are right at $10.  We love the Angel hair Bolognese ($10) and also the Chicken Milanese with angel hair pasta and extra sauce ($16). My absolute favorite is the Lobster and Shrimp Diavolo ($20) it can be as spicy or as mild as you wish.  A salad will cost you an extra $2 but is always nice and crisp and a great italian dressing.  The bread sticks are fantastic also. We eat here very cheap becuase we also gamble here a couple nights a week.  But they always give you BOGO coupons when you leave the restaurant and you can use a Restaurant.com coupon on top of that."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parmigiano, it was really good. Big portions of chicken and it was super cheesy and the sauce was really good. Nice wine choices too. The only complaint I have is that  the service was a little slow, but it looked like they were understaffed. Overall nice, inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  We somehow ended up wandering in here after a movie and boy what a find! Their italian food is really great. The complimentary bread is delicious I must to say. We had the sausage stuffed shells and another pasta dish I can't remember, but both were delicious.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I most recently had an up to now rare five-star dining experience here, where everything I ate was delicious, and service was exemplary, with the bringing of extra Alfredo Sauce, snappy unbidden filling of water glasses, and even quick and professional boxing of leftovers.by our diligent server.  Hot and super cheesy Crab-Stuffed Mushrooms were simply great dipped in their own melted bliss.  And the same was true of Mozzarella Marinara, with excellent plugs of Fried Cheese dipped in a warm, creamy, and slightly sweet Marinara Sauce.  A bowl of rustic Country Bean Soup with Pancetta was thick and hearty, with a spiced up broth teeming with potatoes, Cannellini Beans, carrots, tomatoes, and celery.   And an almost endless House Salad with olives, pepperoncini, artichoke hearts, and a  very tasty Italian Dressing was quite filling.  Home-baked breadsticks were good, too, but rather superfluous.  Then, rounding out this fine Italian dinner spread was an entree of Veal Scallopini with lean and nicely pounded medallions of veal that were smothered with mushrooms and well covered by a sumptuous White Wine Sauce.  Magnificent golden Parmesan Roasted Potatoes offered a welcome accompaniment to close out the meal.    There was simply no room left to seriously entertain ordering a dessert!"}
{"text":"I ordered one of my favorite dishes---NY Strip Sirloin with Marsala/mushroom sauce---and that was excellent for $27....my wife tried something new---Seafood Risotto with shrimp & lobster for $29... the Seafood Risotto arrived beautifully presented....it tasted ok BUT the mouth feel of the rice was over starchy, clumpy, and missing the appropriate amount of moisture--liquid causing it to be more on the dry side...."}
{"text":"Since there is a lack of Italian restaurants in North LV, we settled on this one. Bruchetta appetizer was excellent. I got regular fettuccine alfredo & it's hard to mess that up.  Staff was kind of slow & they didn't appear to be busy. Other people in my party complained about small things though, so I feel bad their experience wasn't as good as mine."}
{"text":"Ordered the Fried Calamari and it was Excellent!   Perfectly cooked and the breading was seasoned just right.  Followed by the Linguini with white clam sauce and it did not disappoint either.  Excellent clam to pasta ratio with excellent mix of herbs and sauce.  I will be back again if I am ever in the area."}
