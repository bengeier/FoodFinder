{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the McCandless North Park Lounge. I know the staff by name and it's our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The Lawrenceville version, not so.  I was so excited when I found out the NPL was coming to Lawrenceville. I regularly drive over 30 minutes just to go to the NPL and now it would be in my backyard. We were legit shouting for joy in my house and it was like a dream come true.  What I found out was that it was only the NPL in name.   The environment: It's kind of a club/bar environment, which is different from the McCandless NPL restaurant environment. Loud music, high bar stools and crappy club tables. Everything is pretty squeezed in and the booths are not for anyone over 200lbs. The McCandless NPL has an older and more family type of crowd, while this is for hipsters and club-goers, of which I'm not.  The prices: The McCandless NPL is expensive and this place is about 5%-10% more expensive.  The food: The McCandless NPL is famous for their \"Lounge Fries\". They attempted to change how their fries were made randomly a few years ago. The new fries were smaller and thinner. The experiment lasted less than a month and everyone rejoiced when the original Lounge Fries returned. Unfortunately, the Lawrenceville NPL got those new Lounge Fries and I was disappointed when I saw those on my plate. They aren't that bad, but it's nothing to be excited about. My burger was similar to the McCandless NPL burger which is always good/  The menu is a little bit different. They have a much smaller menu with multiple items missing. I can't remember which ones in particular, but it's just not the same.   Overall: I was really disappointed with this take on the NPL. It's an impostor. I'm sure the owners and staff meant well enough and I wish them success, but I'd rather drive the extra 30 minutes and get the real NPL experience at the Mccandless NPL. We went there once and we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Walked by on Small Business Saturday and decided to stop in for a drink. Great tap list, Saturday brunch, and a fun vibe. Great place to watch the game. Been looking for a chill sports bar like this in the area."}
{"text":"Not the same style as the other NPL's but a very cool bar w outdoor smoking tent.  I'm told the tent will be non-smoking in the summer but we were there for a Cigar Den Event and NPL was very gracious in allowing us to chill. Anyway, down to business...  We got in and pulled right up to 2 stools at the bar.  Katie, the very friendly bartender, came up right away and offered the HH specials and we ordered our usual beer- Coors Lights. This place has a MASSIVE beer list- probably 40 on tap, but you know how it is- you like what you like.    The cigar event was outside in the heated tent so I headed out there and made friends.  They ordered food- I played 'Food Host'.  The first to arrive was Fish Tacos.  They were rated 4 out of 5, only because the fish needed some seasoning- Old Bay, Blackened, something.  But they looked perfect and tasted great.  The next to arrive was shrimp & tomato bruschetta. 5 Stars as it was delicious.  Lastly was chicken tenders. Another 5 Stars.  Lightly breaded w a thin seasoned batter as moist inside.    We had a very attentive waitress and the bartender was super nice to my wife. We would never return to a bar/restaurant just because of the set up/decor but we will definitely be back for the food and SERVICE.  Your bartender & servers are Top Notch- I hope you treat them well..."}
{"text":"Having dined at the McCandless location in the past, I was looking for a late meal on Sunday evening and stopped in.   Ordered the wedge salad, a burger, and a side of pasta.   Wedge salad was loaded with toppings, delicious.  Burger was very tasty.  The spaghetti side was amazing.  Their pasta would stand up to ANY high-quality Italian restaurant that I've ever been to.    The server?   Not so hot.  Very inattentive, SLOW.   The server was my only let down of a very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"This place isn't much to see from the outside (aside from their purple tree), but it's a really cool spot inside. Went here late on a Friday, it was semi-busy and they had both indoor and outdoor seating available. Our service was excellent, our waitress was really on top of things despite covering a lot of tables. They had $5 LITs, can't go wrong there. Their kitchen was open until 1am, a lot of the other places in Lawrenceville have kitchens that close well before that. The menu looked pretty big though we just got the fries (they have really good ranch dressing). The music selection was on point. Overall this place was great, staff was really friendly and not as stuck up as some of the other places in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to try somewhere new for Sunday Funday brunch and we loved it. We were looking for a place that wouldn't be too crowded and had enough TVs for the Pens game and Olympics. This place was perfect. Everyone was very attentive and the breakfast was delicious. And I never had to wait for a refill on my bottomless mimosas.   We had no idea they had a Valentine's week promo! All ladies received a free piece of Peanut Butter chocolate pie and a heart balloon selection. Inside the hearts were little prizes.. they said coupons or even a pair of Pens tix! Such a cool idea. Haven't popped mine yet, but can't wait to find out what's inside!   Such a pleasant surprise! I would definitely return and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Best spaghetti and meatball I've ever had!  Wish you were closer to Washington.  Huge portions, had enough for lunch today.  Everything homemade, and you can tell. Good luck with this new business!"}
{"text":"gotta go try the food it was very delicious and nice portions , very nice beer list which keep changing (that a good thing)the steak salad was huge,my burger was delicious,and the spaghetti was homemade noodles ,loved it  they have outdoor seating (nice patio)our waitress was very nice and kept checking on us ,oh you get very cold water in a glass  bottle ,very refreshing on a day when it 99 degrees out :))"}
{"text":"This restaurant should probably just stick to burgers and frozen fried bar food.  After waiting at least 5 minutes to order a drink, I finally ordered a mango mojito, I also asked if I could have water, I'm finished with my meal and still waiting for that water. While waiting to place my drink order, I reviewed the menu and really struggled to find something I would like- zero vegetarian choices, which in today's world is ridiculous, mostly every restaurant today can accommodate a non-meat choice. Both my friend and I settled on a spaghetti and meatball entree, mostly because it's not fried food and not salad ( we wanted something hot) also, they told us the meatballs are homemade, not frozen and so is the sauce. They offer 3 types of meatballs, I ordered regular my friend ordered feta spinach, however, she received the same thing I had. If these meatballs in fact are homemade, I would be very surprised, they were not tender like a homemade meatball should taste.  The sauce was very acidic and the pasta was not even close to being al dente, tasted like mush, just terrible! Bad overall experience, and not cheap for the quality either......definitely will never be back! P.S. never did get that water!"}
{"text":"I really like this bar/restaurant.   BEST BARTENDERS of all time. At this point they're like my little family away from home.   The staff had been very attentive & friendly, I like the dimly lit room, and the outdoor tent seating.  This place is not overly saturated with people yet which is amazing.  The beer selection is great compared to a lot of surrounding places. I've been here more times than I can count and honestly haven't been disappointed with the food (yet).    #savethefireballmeatballs !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love north park lounge in the north hills, and it's so great they put one in Lawrenceville. It has all the great food like lounge fries and the stuffed cheese pretzel that the restaurant up north has. Also the pasta isn't bad either. They make an AMAZING chicken Parmesan for a non-Italian restaurant. The wings are also delicious. They have a lot of beers on tap. If your looking for good beer and food I highly recommend this place, it also doesn't have a huge hipster crowd which is hard to find in Lawrenceville."}
