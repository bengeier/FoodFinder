{"text":"Best place in Tempe for fast, cheap, and most importantly delicious food. No question about it.

Great people, great food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I was thoroughly disappointed. For starts, the service was bad. The guy taking our order acted as if we were a burden. We ordered passion fruit slush with boba, mocha slush with boba, teriyaki chicken bento, and a shortrib bento. It took about 30 minutes. The boba was GARBAGE. the drinks were chalky, overly sweet with syrup and the boba was hard and tasted old. We tossed them in the trash immediately. The shortrib meat was mostly fat, what a ripoff. The teriyaki chicken was TOUGH and dry, and the macaroni salad is like mystery mush. I'm so sad and disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Grilled Ave by my coworkers. Service and value are beyond compare. I always get the teriyaki chicken bowl. With tax it comes out to $5.45 and is enough food for 2 meals. The chicken is very tasty and the sticky rice is perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and I really like their bentos, especially their macaroni salad. Its really nice and not too greasy. 

They do take sometime to service your order but that is typical of a small place like this. I find the young girl at the counter very pretty and polite as well. :)"}
{"text":"Good place for a cheap meal and centrally located close to Mill Ave and ASU.  I'm a fan of the Chicken Katsu bowl- $5.50 and very filling.  I've also tried the Hawaiian Shrimp- breaded and fried served with a sweet and sour-ish dipping sauce.  They were decent but I was a little turned off when I noticed some of the shrimp still had the poop-vein in them...but hey, a little shrimp turd never hurt anyone, right? But seriously, I ate them regardless and feel fine.

They also sell candy and other sweets if you want some gummy burgers to go with your bento. Yum!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat around ASU! Their chicken katsu is the BEST! Great atmosphere, quaint and sweet. Very delicious sushi, salads, bowls and appetizers. Ramen too! I am always delighted to eat here. Get their chicken katsu bento with seaweed salad!!!"}
{"text":"The spicy pork bowl with a green boba matcha prepared by a family owned shop. Perfect! Favors are much bigger than the seating space. Has a Tokyo \"Elbows to Elbows\" noodle shop vibe but the table outside on a day like today. 5 stars. I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This used to be Mai Island Grill when I was a student at ASU. I noticed Mai Island closed and is now Grill Ave, but since they have a similar menu -- I decided to give it a try.

I was hoping their food would be similar, but it wasn't  :(  I had the chicken teriyaki bento. I'll say the best part was the side salad, but everything else lacked the quality and sweet Hawaiian flavor Mai Island once had."}
{"text":"This place was good for its price. It is defeniy place where it gives you the college atmosphere. Their lunch box menu is pretty simple. Many people seems to get to go box because of the space limit. I would recommend this place to everyone if you are hungry. Everything is under 10 so it is budget friendly."}
{"text":"I was eating the NEW YORK SUSHI BENTI and I realized that tempe is NOT THAT BAD. Seriously, so so delicious! I would live inside Grilled Ave if I could! They make their macaroni salads with the tears of angels some pepper and some corn! Definitely the most redeeming factor of a dry ass, hot ass desert town. Super bummed that they're closed on sunday because I WANT TO EAT HERE EVERYDAY! I WANT TO LIVE HERE EVERYDAY! Often is half the price of chipotle without the fckn corporate greed! GET FED WITHOUT FEEDING THE MACHINE MANNN! 

- Al"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is amazing, it is run by a very nice, hardworking family, and the food normally comes out pretty quickly, however, it can get overly packed on some days and may take longer. Overall this place is a great hole in the wall restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great little spot next to ASU Tempe campus. Pretty fast w/ good quality food! (Love their mac salad). Much more affordable than the Hawaiian spot down the street."}
{"text":"Great boba, good teriyaki, and cute a location. I've had the ramen and found it to be far too salty, but that's ok, I know now to stick with the teriyaki or the bulgogi, which have never disappointed. It's definitely my preferred boba spot in Tempe."}
{"text":"Food: Amazing, absolutely delicious.  My favorite is the New York roll and the Teriyaki tofu.

Service: horrible. it's not in a timely manner.  Once I ordered my usual, thai boba with teriyaki tofu... they brought out my food really late, I waited over a half hour and there wasn't many people there. Also... THEY FORGOT THE TOFU! they brought my plate to me with just rice and greens but no tofu.... HOW DOES SOMEONE FORGET A DETAIL LIKE THAT?


the service is horrible.... but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is just a rip off of the Flame Broiler down the street. Ribs are awful, chicken is fatty, and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly . 1st time here. I feel like the chicken could have been fresher for the teriyaki meal . Will come back and try something different ."}
{"text":"I've come in here a few times and I must say that it is delicious food at cheap prices. I got an entire teriyaki bowl and dumplings with a drink for under 7 dollars. Decent atmosphere, it is usually quiet, so perhaps a good spot to get some work done as you eat. Great place for lunch w friends. Take out is always an option too. Check it out if you're in the mood for something asian and different."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and it's okay. The meat to rice ratio is kind of sad, and they're not generous at all with the amount of boba in the boba drinks. The smoothie drinks themselves are all powder-based, I tried the avocado and it was yuck. The boba itself is alright, they were kinda harder than the average tapioca ball. However, this place does the trick if you're hungry, but I'd just go to Paradise Hawaiian BBQ for the same type of food for better quality and value."}
{"text":"I've been here only once and had to stop and get a quick something. I was amazed at the prices and looking at everyones food it was big portions. Sadly I only got the pot stickers with I got a dozen for like $2 can't go wrong with that. I must go back and have a real meal next time."}
{"text":"Initially, I found this place when looking for options to eat that were close to campus. This was recommended to me by a friend, and so I went and tried the chicken katsu bento. I found out their definition of a bento was to be a takeout box with two measly sides; macaroni salad and some vegetables that were easily forgettable. The salad was too sweet for my taste, and the vegetables, salty and poorly cooked. The chicken itself was alright in texture, but it was drenched in sauce, and I had wished they could have put it on the side (or that I had considered telling them to put it separately from the food). 

My friend had gotten the Hawaiian shrimp and potstickers, so I tried them, but the shrimp had an immense amount of breading on it, and lacked any amount of actual shrimp meat inside--all I got from it was that it was mealy. The potstickers aren't my thing, only because I prefer other kinds of fillings, but my friend seems to like the texture, which was fine.

I came back again today to try one of their sushi rolls, and got the New York roll. I had asked them the ingredients, but wasn't aware that it'd be fried. I was watching the girl finish up my order with an inordinate amount of sauce, and to put it lightly, I was a little horrified. You could not only hardly get the flavours inside the sushi roll itself, but the only flavour I got from it was the fishy smell from the overcooked salmon inside. I was less than impressed with the treatment of the roll, so I won't be getting anything from their sushi menu again. 

This place is alright if you're very hungry and looking for a cheap take-out lunch, but I wouldn't go here for dinner."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this little place. Haven't had good bugolgi since I lived in Hawaii. Meat was tender and had a lot of flavor to it!  Macaroni salad was very good also. Going to go back and try the kalbi and chicken katsu. Young waitress was nice and polite. Definitely going to keep going back to this place. I'm happy and full right now. Now time for a bicycle ride:)"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week and I'm always amazed at how delicious the food is, especially considering the small space they're working in. Everyone is very friendly and it's the perfect place to stop by and grab a bite to eat if you're around the Asu campus. I always get the chicken katsu and it's the best I've ever had! Seriously check this place out"}
{"text":"This place is small, but it serves the purpose, so far i have only tried the teriyaki chicken and the new york sushi and they are actually really good. It is conveniently located near ASU which is a plus for me since I have classes that are close by, so whenever I get hungry I walk a block and get a quick snack. Also their boba drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"Looks like this restaurant is run by a family of 3. Went for lunch sit-down and ordered the bulgogi bowl with sides of seaweed salad and kimchi. The portion for the entre was great and the total came out to around $10 so it was reasonably priced. The meat was wonderfully flavored and when I finished the sides, I craved some more. I wish that they would serve more vegetables with the meat because I didn't even know there was any until I dug below. I would definitely want to come back here again."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Teriyaki bento.  Nice sauce, grilled very well.  The macaroni salad seemed to be pretty standard, and the \"veggies\" I got was little more than some salad mix with a ginger-y dressing.  Overall it was good, but I think a little overpriced for what it was.  Also, they did not honor the Yelp Check-in coupon for a free drink with entree that I attempted to use."}
{"text":"Update-
I'm sad to say this but I'm actually quite disappointed. I went yesterday during lunch and ordered a bowl (half orange chicken and half teriyaki chicken). Since I last ate here, they've hiked the prices and the food isn't of the same quality anymore. The bowls are now $7..they used to be $5.50. There were barely any vegetables. The orange chicken was lacking the sauce so I basically had dry breaded chicken. Only one or two pieces had sauce on top. The teriyaki chicken was rather bland. My food was luke warm; not hot. Not sure if I feel like going back again. It used to be my favorite place around campus because of how affordable it was."}
{"text":"Best value by ASU campus. Fresh food, good size, great taste. Cons? Very small inside, and sometimes there is a wait. 

Spicy teriyaki chicken bowl is my go-to option here and it is ideal. So much more flavor than your average fast-food Asian restaurant it just wakes up my tongue with flavor. Just so you know, despite the name it is not very spicy at all. For about $7 bucks it's the most food for your money you can get around campus, and the punch card gives a great incentive to come back for more. The bento is worth the few dollars extra I really like their macaroni salad it's not mushy or generic like others. 

Depending on the time and the day there can be a bit of a wait. Seating is very limited too and not the kind of place you could sit and pass the time. But for lunch or to-go there is no ASU place I'd recommend more."}
{"text":"Great food! Not too pricey really nice and typically doesn't take long at all. I go there atleast once a week and my wallet isn't complaining and my stomach is certainly thanking me every time!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Thai tea with boba and a teriyaki chicken bowl. The chicken was overcooked but they give you plenty. The boba was good but the tea was over sweetened. This place use to be a lot better a couple of years ago but it's starting to go downhill. Such a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I honestly liked the place, it was cute in a cramped college loft kind of way (don't take large groups, there isn't much seating), my tariyaki bowl was good, if a bit over priced for what it was, and the potstickers were very good if you like them crunchy. However my boyfriends ramen was rather unforgivable. It was literally a .25 c top ramen noodle, spice packet and all, with a few veggies and pathetic tiny meat bits in it. The beef pieces weren't even the size of a split pea. We also got some boba teas that were pretty good, though their interpretation of Thai tea is a bit different than any other Thai places we've eaten at. Sorry to say we won't be coming back, we could have made the exact same thing at home in half the time for not even an 8th the price."}
{"text":"So the hours and website doesn't matter apparently - we went the other day and were greeted with, \"closed until August\" this was midway through July! Wtf. So annoyed."}
{"text":"Love this place! The one guy does everything from taking orders to cooking to collecting money. But great food."}
{"text":"An adorable cozy cafe style family owned restaurant, portions are good! And look and taste amazing! And they have BOBA drinks!!! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I come here often with my friends. This place is great if you are in the mood for rice and meat or boba. It is also good during ASU Football game days because it is close to Devils on Mill and the stadium. I love getting the Bulgolgi Bowl. It tastes delicious and is probably the best bulgolgi around the area that I've tasted so far. The boba is not bad either. The fruity drinks are just okay, but the green tea and milk tea taste really good. You'll usually get a mixture of hard and soft boba balls. The staff is nice, but sometimes hard to understand because they talk so softly and the place gets noisy a little with the AC on. There are not many seats, but you can also try upstairs or outside if there is no more downstairs. They have a bathroom upstairs too. I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"For me, Grilled Ave was a great find when I was walking towards Mill Avenue with my sister in the search for food that wasn't campus food. They had just opened at that time, and the first visit was stellar enough to warrant repeated patronage. 
I had the Katsu Chicken the first time, and after trying a few more dishes, it's the only meal I order. The Kalbee beef is OK, and the orange chicken is not that great. The bowls run relatively cheap -- between $5.50-$6.50 if I remember correctly -- and you have the option to upgrade it to a combo for about $1.50 more which includes a salad and a side of macaroni salad. The macaroni salad is unusual, but tasty. I usually don't get the combo, as it's a lot of food, but I've heard people tell thier friends that the combo is a great deal when they're ordering.
I've ordered the Vegas and the lobster rolls in the past when going there with other people, and they didn't seem to be that great. Both rolls had a lot of deep fried-ness and tons of cream cheese going on -- they tasted like they were trying too hard. I don't think I'll order anymore sushi rolls from this place. 
The eating area is very small, it only accommodates two parties of four. The rest of the seating is bar style seating against the wall. They have a upstairs area to seat more people, but at least from the last time I was there, this area is rather unfurnished. 
Overall, Grilled Ave is a tasty meal within walking distance of ASU. I would suggest the sushi rolls and the Chicken Katsu is probably their best dish (which is pretty awesome but expect the other menu offerings to not quite exceed it's awesomeness)."}
{"text":"Nice mix of Korean, Japanese, and Americanized Korean/Japanese. The bento versions are enormous and I usually go for the bowl sizes. It is on the small size (but has a bit of space upstairs & outside) and gets busy at lunchtime, so plan on take out if you don't get there early. Great flavors and nice folks!"}
{"text":"I recently tried the spicy bulgogi rice bowl, and my post impression is that it satiated my hunger at the time, and the pork bulgogi had good spice and flavor, and for serving size they were generous. As for price, it was inexpensive and service was quick. My grievance is their milk tea size selection. There's only one, and it's a large. Not a fan of being relegated to a large size drink, they should just stick with a small/regular size and not be an enabler to growing waists."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place. Coming from California I LOVE teriyaki and am still in desperate need of a new place for my craving. We went in around 6:00 pm and we're the only ones in the restaurant. Ordered beef teriyaki to go and waited about 25 minuets for them to make our food. Thought the wait was long concerning this is a college town. After we received our food my boyfriend and I headed to our car to drive to a club meeting that we were now late for considering the long wait time. Boyfriend got hungry and opened up the box to find some strange deep fried looking cubes. Takes a bite to find out that we were given tofu. Now my disappointment starts to set in. I try and look on the bright side as my stomach was roaring at this point. Tofu is alright I guess, I say to myself. Take one bite and I spit it out. The most unfortunate tofu I have ever tasted before in my life. We ended up throwing it all away. Will not be back. Save yourself the time and money and try someplace else."}
{"text":"I have had several rice bowls there including orange chicken and teriyaki chicken, and they were both awesome.  Portions are nice and big, and there is an awesome selection of items to choose from.

The drinks are wonderfully varied as well, and I was even able to get iced coffee with bobba in it!  It was awesome.

And also always check upstairs for the extra seating!  It's really pretty up there :)

Only drawback is closeness to the street, which can make you an unintentional hearer of misunderstandings between passer-byes."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's a family run place that serves great food near campus. If you are on campus and want to find some lunch at a decent price, skip the Panda Express and go here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Definitely disappointing, but fairly cheap. 

Decided to go here for a light lunch between classes. Ordered the lobster roll bento box and edamame. The bento consisted of the roll, a small green salad, macaroni salad and two gyoza. 

The roll arrived panko fried, which I was not informed of nor expecting, and piping hot. When executed correctly, flash frying sushi can add layers of complexity with contrasting temperatures and textures. However this attempt simply caused the mayo on lobster roll to become runny. This, coupled with the liberal application of eel sauce turned the roll into a gloppy unappetizing mess.

The macaroni salad was pretty good (I don't usually like macaroni salad) and the gyoza were nicely crisp, but the edamame were lukewarm and over-salted.

Much of what I like about Japanese cuisine, the simplicity of preparation and the emphasis on quality ingredients, was sadly absent. Instead there is an almost greasy spoon type reliance on salts and fats to make food taste good.

Maybe I should have had the katsu chicken, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was good on my visits as described in my original review. However, I have found the bubble tea to take a dive in quality. It is far too sweet and contains about 90% water/sugar with little to no tea flavor. Also, I always get met with confusion and hysteria when I ask for no ice. This is a completely normal request and I have never met this resistance at any other boba shop. I won't be getting tea here again, although I may go again for food."}
{"text":"Grilled Ave is (I think) the only teriyaki house within reasonable walking distance of ASU's Tempe campus, and by reasonable walking distance I mean you can walk there for a lunch break and walk back to class in enough time. It is a very tiny space, with seating (upstairs, downstairs, and outside) for about 20 if you're lucky. Their upstairs loft is pretty cute, and nice if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the downstairs area. It is warm throughout the entire building, so keep that in mind if you're looking to spend a decent amount of time here. The restaurant is cooled off with portable A/C units, which seem to struggle to keep up the output when battling agains the open-top grill they have in the kitchen.

The teriyaki is good. It definitely satisfies my cravings every time I get a hankering for teriyaki (which, let's be real- is pretty often). I go here about twice a week and the quality is definitely consistent.

The only complaint I have is the small amount of veggies that come with your bowl. I always order a bowl with extra veggies, which compared to any other teriyaki house, is a less-than-normal serving of veggies. If you were to order a teriyaki bowl plain (with no extra vegetables) you would get scraps (and I mean that in the most literal sense) of veggies. I'm talking maybe a strand of cabbage and slice of carrot. I don't know why they do this, because veggies (compared to proteins at least) aren't worth their weight in gold? But the veggies that they serve up are really delicious. They used to included grilled onions in their veggie mix, but have done away with those which actually makes me really sad. Out of any teriyaki place I've been to, though, the grilled veggies that they serve are my absolute favorite. 

I really don't have a problem with this place at all. The service is average, as you would expect at any other place where your order at a counter. The two owners (I presume) that work here everyday seem to really care about their business. I will keep returning to Grilled Ave so long as I'm at ASU."}
{"text":"Decently fast, good flavors and potion size. I just wish the had the noodle dishes for lunch.

I had the teriyaki tofu bowl. Fried tofu a few veggies and a bed of rice, I appreciated the light hand on the teriyaki sauce which was not too sweet at all and the hints of sesame oil."}
{"text":"Actually ordered food from here this time. I got the fried sushi roll with lobster (I can't remember the name), and it was pretty good considering this eatery doesn't exactly specialize in sushi. Also, if ordering a drink, or at least a milk tea, I personally recommend getting it blended, as opposed to iced, as last time my iced milk tea came out far too potent, but my blended milk tea today was far more suitable for my palate. The boba, however, was far too firm for my liking. Warning: it can be a little pricey though, as a small--although the cup itself isn't too diminutive in size--milk tea is $4."}
{"text":"I came here at noon during spring break. When I walked in, no one was there. I rang the bell on the counter. No one came out from the back. I waited and rang the bell again. Nobody. I waited and rang the bell a third time. No one. I walked out having been unable to even find an employee much less place an order and try the food. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. I read the reviews before going and it turned out to be exactly like what the reviews said. Their food is decent, but nothing to crave over. I get the katsu or bulgogi cause they give you a decent amount of meat. I never tried any of their milk tea drinks because I heard they weren't that great. It's all powder according to a friend. Price is whatever, I just go here sometimes when I want to eat something Korean and I'm still stuck on campus. Only go here if you're desperate!"}
{"text":"if you're around the brickyard this is a great place to get a meal I can't even begin to describe how hard it is to find good rice around Asu.  the chicken katsu is deliciously crispy and sliced super thin so its easy to eat on the go.   The dish is a little heavy on the sauce, but overall its pretty good. I stop by this shop maybe once a week on the way to work and its worth a try.  however if you're looking for some real juicy korean bbq and lots of sides I'd recommend paradise hawaiian down the street"}
{"text":"Easily the best teriyaki in town! It's very affordable and generously portioned. Service is as quick as possible for the size of the business, and the atmosphere is cozy and family-style. Speaking of family, it feels good to support a local business. Particularly since the menus is quite expansive for their limited staff! The only complaint is that lunch rush means seating fills up very quickly and you may have to take your meal to eat outside or somewhere else. A small price to pay for the cheapest and tastiest lunch in Tempe!

Recommended dish: teriyaki bowl with extra vegetables. Divine!"}
{"text":"Man, I really want to like this place... I've walked by this place over a hundred times and have never been in. I got out of class early today and decide to treat myself and get their Caramel Mocha boba (so called most popular) that they advertise on the window. First sip was interesting seems alright, then the second sip was just getting worse. Boba was hard inside and hadn't been soaked long enough so the boba itself was small and hard inside and bland on the outside... Then can the really sweet taste like pure sugar water, then came the weird flavor of artificial mocha with caramel. I remember seeing in the back how they made it and I think they are all made out of a powder mixture. Something just definitely didn't taste right... Either had artificial sweeteners in it or bad tasting water in the mixture. I've had a lot of boba and this is by far the worst one ever... I'm so sad and disappointed, I really wanted it to be good! $3.99 for boba which comes out to $4.35 is pretty pricey for boba but that's what you get for being near ASU I wouldn't have mind the price if it was actually good. It's such a cute place that has so much potential!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Lots of different food options and everything is pretty good. The boba drink options are the most I have ever seen and they are pretty good and worth trying. One of my go-tos here is the Las Vegas roll (amazing) or the orange chicken."}
{"text":"Went here for boba based on a review. I got avocado, it was pretty good but there really wasn't much boba : ( a little disappointed"}
{"text":"Went back two more times and tried their Chicken Katsu Bento, Hawaiian Shrimp and Kal Bee Bento. 

I think my favorites are Chicken Katsu and Kalbee so far. The portion of food you get for the price definitely won't leave you hungry. I actually had to eat my bento in phases so I can finish everything.

I love the fact that the whole family are working there from ordering to making your food. A really nice and friendly place to relax and enjoy affordable good Korean food.

Can't wait for them to extend their hours and add more Korean dished on their menu."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and service. Chick Katsu Bento is the dish!!"}
{"text":"The one star is for location. That the ONLY good part. The teriaki chicken bowl is nothing but fatty meat and OVER PRICED. The amount you get is so small and their brocolli isnt cooked. Its practically raw. Will never be taking my business here again. Also, they seem to have no idea what customer service is."}
{"text":"EDIT: the service is actually pretty slow. But it is good here. 

Great little place for good, cheap teriyaki. They're not the fastest, but the staff is friendly and it's not unbearably slow. The food is very good for the price. Although the place is kind of small, its cozy and there is decent seating. 

The boba isn't the best. The boba itself is kind of chewy my taste and I taste a lot of sugar in the tea. But the flavor isn't bad. 

Overall, it's a nice plae close to campus - good for a between-class lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, good service! Also pretty good prices. Definitely recommend the chicken katsu and bulgogi!"}
{"text":"This cozy express eatery offers primarily teriyaki bowls in chicken (orange, katsu), beef (bulgogi, l\kalbi) and rib from 4.99-$5.99.  Bento lunches, which include macaroni salad, steamed rice and vegetables are only $1.50 more.

The surprise hit here is the sushi rolls.   There are only three kinds, but they are not only made fresh and are incredibly flavorful, but at $5.49 they are a delicious value.  You absolutely have to try their version of the Las Vegas Roll, with avocado and cream cheese combined with spicy crab and lightly tempura battered and fried, then drizzled with a sweet chili sauce.

Their assortment of smoothies ranging from coconut to guava, iced blended coffees, and boba teas is also notable.

The seating area is small, the space is cramped overall, the air conditioning does not seem to be working well, but the staff is friendly and committed to their product - and it's just a great place to come by for take-out or a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good food, great price!

A mix of Korean and Japanese dishes to satisfy your Asian cravings, at prices reasonable enough for the college crowd (just about everything was less than $10). The place is tiny, so during a rush it would be difficult to try and get around, but when I went at 7 pm, the place was comfortable and the two people working there were friendly. 

My only complaint was that the sushi roll we got was falling apart en route to my mouth, but it was still tasty!

Pay with cash to help keep costs low! :)"}
{"text":"This place is decent to say the least. I only come here when I'm desperate. I typically go to the nearby Paradise Hawaiian BBQ for Asian bbq and local dishes from Hawaii. The chicken katsu is just ok and the same can be said about the Teri plates. The prices are also decent. The service is spotty but this place is family run it seems so that's understandable. They do NOT honor the current free drink after yelp check in deal. Wish this place had better quality food and service."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's in a cool venue, close to campus, the staff is great, and their food is delicious. Also super vegan and vegetarian friendly, I love the tofu teriyaki bowl!"}
{"text":"I found this place on accident earlier this semester. Good food, service, and not crowded and noisy like Panda Express. Works for introverts like me. I've been coming here often lately and had the chicken katsu with the egg rolls which were bomb tasty. It's the perfect spot to \"get away\" from the hustle n bustle of campus and to wind down. I like to draw on that big chalkboard they have."}
{"text":"Their prices are more reasonable and their staff friendlier (at least the older individuals) than Paradise Hawaiian, however, the quality is questionable. The teriyaki chicken is unusually tough/leathery and the boba in their drinks are terribly starchy, clumped together, and at times, not completely cooked. The boba smoothies overall are over-icy and are simply just powder mixed with ice (I've watched them assemble it). I recommend their bulgogi or katsu bentos or ramen for first-time visitors. Hawaiian shrimp is also good. Their kalbi takes a while to cook but, it's worth the wait. Warning: They don't serve macaroni salad on Thursdays (I don't hold that against them). Also, do not order the fried rice or the shrimp udon. They are frozen food items that they reheat (if I might take a stab, the fried rice is the chicken yakitori you can find at the frozen section at Costco)."}
{"text":"A great place to go for a quick lunch. Their teriyaki chicken and beef dishes are very tasty and reasonably priced. 

One downside of this place - do not get their boba tea. I was excited that they have bona tea initially but their boba tea are loaded with brown sugar. You can barely taste the tea and sugar content is extremely high. They also would not serve their boba tea with no ice."}
{"text":"Ok place if you are a student on a budget, I suppose.  I am usually a big fan of places like this, even though it's been a few years since I've been in school.  Cheap teriyaki, prepared fast.  The only problem was that the taste was a bit underwhelming both times I went there - passable but not very memorable.  Worth a stop every once in while if you only have $6 in your wallet."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch when I am craving for rice bowl. The spicy pork bulgogi is my number one choice. Juicy slide pork with spicy Korean sauce are great combination. My second favorite is katsu bowl. Tasty katsu sauce makes the katsu and rice taste even better. The side of kim chi is a must."}
{"text":"I found a place near campus that has some of the Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian food I like. I got the Katsu Bento which was pretty good. The portion was good I was satiated after my meal. As far as quality it wasn't anything memorable, but nonetheless it is probably a place I'll frequent out of convenience."}
{"text":"I've yet to have better Teriyaki anywhere else that serves it. No one comes close to their tender, tender flame-kissed chicken breast. They grill it first to lock in the marinade and then steam it to perfection so that it's super moist. And no one comes remotely close to the rich, thick, sweet and sour tang of their homemade sauce. The veggies are always fresh and delicious, but they are a bit skimp on them. So order extra veggies to get what feels like a proper ratio, IMO. 
A beautiful, homely little resturant. It is quite the perfect example of a fantastic hole-in-the-wall. Family owned and operated. Great service and very good prices for the quality and amount you get. But do not bring more than 4 people, there is no room. Good for lunch and dates. 
The only other thing besides the veg situation that keeps it from getting 5 stars is the fact they only use styrofoam... No dishes. Everything is one time use bowls and plastic utensils. So I feel a little bad for eating here. But with food this good, it's already a sin!"}
{"text":"I miss this place. A little over a year ago when I worked nearby I would frequent this place about 3 times a week. I would rotate between spicy bulgogi, teriyaki beef, and teriyaki chicken.

The portions can be pretty filling and the quality ranges from absolutely delicious to disappointing--although this low end is very seldom. What you get here is pretty inconsistent for such an established restaurant--I would say that is my biggest complaint. Quality is what varies the most, but so do prices and portion sizes. For example, out of the (probably) hundred times I've visited, maybe twice I got chicken that was almost inedible because you could tell it was sitting at the bottom of a warmer or something all day; granted, this was probably near closing, but I was pretty upset when I got home after a long day only to find that the dinner I just purchased was inedible. I never complained because, as I said, it happened very seldomly. I just wish they would have told me they were out of chicken, instead of serving me something that while technically is chicken, is not what I thought I was paying for.

Anyway, overall great food, but now I'm pretty wary about going there because it can be a gamble."}
{"text":"Love the new York and Vegas rolls. I don't like how they waste so much styrofoam but overall a yummy place and close to the design building. Prepare to wait a while for your food though. If you go there frequently, ask for a stamp card."}
{"text":"Good spot walking distance from ASU to satisfy my chicken katsu craving. I prefer the katsu here to that at Paradise. The portions are generous and the katsu was made to order. One complaint is that my order took about 30 minutes, despite the lack of a crowd. Not a bad choice if you don't have any time constraints. 

Friendly owners and employees."}
{"text":"This is a family-owned Korean restaurant. Their kimchi IS the BEST!! Sometimes the wait is looong but I don't care about the wait as the quality of food they serve is awesome. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes to have delicious healthy lunch :-)  ^^"}
{"text":"A great place to eat near campus if you want some Japanese or Korean meat and rice, amongst other things. I ordered the Spicy Bulgogi bowl (there is also a bento version with some sides like kimchi, macaroni or salad for an extra +$1). The price for this bowl was ~$7, give or take. It was a lot of food and also good tasting. But, one small thing is that it is 75% rice and 25% meat. It was still worth it and delicious nonetheless. 

So if you want a quick bite to eat, I recommend checking out Grilled Avenue. Well, it's quick during certain times."}
{"text":"Its a nice place with great Asian food, cheaply priced. Takes about five to ten minutes to wait for food, and its a good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I just went to this place this morning, they had the bad attitude, bad customer service, I ordered 1 chicken katzsu & 1 matcha boba tea, their tea tastes horrible, it disgusted me. I trashed it after 1 sip. If you want to waste your money for this type of cheap stuffs & they will end up in the trash can, here is the place you should go."}
{"text":"First time back in a while. Tried the split bento half orange chicken half teriyaki beef.  Had to pay $1 extra to split. Portions we a decent size. Price is great. Less then $9 even with the extra $1. Service was great. Seating are is very small. Orange chicken was good. Kinda tangy. Better than the beef which was also kinda tangy for some reason. Not even close to pei Wei but not bad. Side salad was typical Asian salad. Mixed greens with a vinaigrette."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. The food is flavorful and very reasonable priced. It's centrally located on the ASU Tempe campus and offers students a great variety that was lacking in that specific part of campus. My favorite thing there was the Bulgogi or Bul Go Kee (as on the menu) and I got a bento box combo that came with a delicious side salad and creamy macaroni salad. For $8, the amount of food and quality of meat was great. 

Also, they offer a great selection of both fountain and freezer drinks and snacks and the service is great. The owner is a sweetheart. As another reviewer noted, you can order from an eclectic selection of sides for your meal as well as an inspired and customer-friendly appetizer menu (available in half and full portions for those short on cash or appetite). You can also have your main combo meat normal or \"spicy\". Options/customization are huge with me. It show's the owner cares to provide a fun and enjoyable experience for their customer. Another cool thing too is that, if you enjoy a certain sauce you can buy bottles of their sauces that they'll make for you (Teriyaki, Ponzu, a crap load of others) for like $3.99. It's a great way to bring a flavor home and support a local restaurant.

The level of detail (in a simplified and user-friendly sense) is astounding for such a small humble place on campus. I hope this place thrives unlike the last two places that were here (Mai and Gyros Hut).

Also, how does it make sense to review an establishment based on a restaurant that used to be in its place? Gyros Hut actually predated Grilled, but you don't see me complaining about they're lack of lamb offering. LOL"}
{"text":"Yay decent teriyaki near campus that I like better then the nearby Paradise Hawaiian 

Got the Katsu Bento for 6.95 and friend got the Teriyaki Chicken sans bento for a dollar less. Big portions  - Cheap - Cool interior 

So far I'm a fan of this restaurant row of Grilled Ave and Gluttons

(Oh yea its Korean owned! And you can draw on the walls like they do at The Street Boba)"}
{"text":"Best place for Korean and Japanese food on the go. Great food, great prices. I've gone here so many times and really love their chicken katsu bowl and bulgogi. 
All the food is made fresh and doesn't take that long. 

Only downside is it's cramp and very small, so not ideal for big groups. 

But overall the place is amazing and serves some of the best Japanese and Korean food I've had. 

If you're an ASU student, definitely go to this place! Lots of good food for a good price."}
{"text":"They don't honor the Yelp deal they have listed here.

I ordered a plate (bento) and wasn't offered my choice of sides even though they were listed on the menu, so make sure to ask for what you want as sides.

Ordered the chicken katsu and the teriyaki beef. The katsu tasted pretty good and the beef was alright.

Overall, the  food is aesthetically pleasing and tastes okay for the price but a bit of a let down, even if I disregard the false advertising."}
{"text":"This is a great little place right near campus. Seemed under the radar but I've been going for over a year and they don't disappoint. The katsu chicken is my favorite meal, sometimes with a side of hawaiian fried shrimp. The boba is what sells this place for me. Their flavors taste great and are never watered down whether blended or on ice. Black milk tea, thai tea, and taro are my favorites so far. Definitely coming here even after I graduate."}
{"text":"Paid for extra meat and veggies, went back when I opened the box to find neither. They just shrugged. It didn't help they didn't speak English. 10 dollars gone for a 5 dollar meal. Thank grilled ave."}
{"text":"I've been going here since they opened. This place is a go-to for me when I want a cheap, delicious meal. I usually just get fried rice and a half-order of potstickers, which is enough food for my small appetite. The prices are great - about $3.50 for my order. The potstickers are crispy and come with a tasty vinegar-soy sauce. Their fried rice is the bomb. It has small pieces of carrots, broccoli and onion in it, and the seasoning they use is so good plain, but I'll usually throw a little sriracha and soy in it for my own personal tastes."}
{"text":"So I decided to check this place out because the numbers didn't sound too bad. $5 for a chicken teriyaki bowl. Decent portion, I will say that..... however I can get the same stuff for $2 at #1 Sushi in Metrocenter. Also, they cook their food ahead of time, and scoop the rice and chicken out of containers. It's okay, a little too dry for my taste, but by no means the worst I have ever had... They are really nice though and the potstickers were great.... they fry those to order."}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki bowl on my lunch hour. The service was very fast. But in turn, that was not a blessing. The chicken was not tender, and tasted either over cooked or just old and dry. 
Portion was decent, but overall flavor wasn't impressive. 
Chicken was cooked in a wok and not grilled. 

I would suggest Yogi's Grill in place of this establishment."}
{"text":"Fast, reasonably priced and decent quality when school is in session.  Had the chicken teriyaki bowl with white meat and found it generous in portion size and filling.  I like it for lunch."}
