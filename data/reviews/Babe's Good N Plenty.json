{"text":"I love finding new small 'family' restaurants that may have a unique sauce or dish that is different from a standard formula chain taste. Plus, I'd rather give my $ to local businesses that usually give you more for your money with great customer service to boot.

The other day  my assistant told me about \"Babe's\" on Lorain near W.98th-(form.Hobo Joe's)  and how their ribs were  drop off the bone delicious! and at a good price-$9 for a dinner with lots of fries and coleslaw. Couldn't wait!
Next day we phoned an order in.. My asst. told them on  the phone how good her dinner was the previous night and placed my order-1st time she'd been there too.

To be brief,  it was simply the WORST ribs I've had in my life! No sarcasm  here!  I bit into a rib and the \"meat?\" hit my teeth like a hard piece of fiber board! I tried  to chew it but it looked like a ball of splinters when I spit it out..I'm brave and tried another bone. the meat-(not the bone) cut the inside of my top lip-it drew blood! 

I could tell the fries were old, hardish/mealy/uncooked in the center and rewarmed poorly. Coleslaw was runny and too burny. The ribs and fries had freezer burn taste and past the (pretty good flavored BBQ sauce) \"turf/particle board' meat there was a layer of slimy fat!  No meat, gel-ly fat UUUHHGG!  The 'meatcut' and bleeding stopped the  \"trying\"

We called but \"the owner left\"....I do not want a free meal-MY God-NO WAY! $9 thrown to the trash, saltwater on my cut lip and gums and 24-48hrs Botulism can show up-(not yet)..I feel  rumblings tho...back to Geppetto's? DEFINITELY-After if I  can look at another rib.

I really am shocked it could be that horrible. But  it really was.  (8-("}
{"text":"Stopped in today for some BBQ. Yum!!! I'm a southern girl and know good BBQ. These guys know their stuff. Tried the ribs and pork shoulder. Excellent. And the fried okra, collard greens and sweet potato pie were awesome. The folks that work there are friendly as all get out and you'll feel right at home. Food was ready in a jiffy. You'll smell the smokin' BBQ long before you reach the restaurant! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finding great fried chicken shouldn't be as hard as it is. We've got tons of wonderful food in this city but there IS a dearth of EFCP's (excellent fried chicken places), and NO, the colonel does NOT exist in my world. Sorry, KFC lovers, but that is one bucket o'crap.

Anyway, as has been described earlier, this is a tiny hole-in-wall run by very nice people (Hi, Betty and Greg! Or is it Craig??) who put out some righteous vittles. Whenever wifey or I get jonesin' for some chicken of the fried variety, this is THE only place we go. And I'll tell you about some of their other stuff as soon as we order something different.  Don't hold your breath. 

YUMMY!"}
{"text":"While attending to some pre-xmas meat-buying errands, I passed Babe's and decided to stop in for lunch on my way home.  Tucked in to a tiny hole in the wall next to a mini mart on W117 is exactly the sort of pedigree one looks for in a soul food restaurant so I was excited to pop in and see what they had to offer.

Chicken and waffles?  Check!
Macaroni and Cheese? Check!
BBQ Pig's Feet?  Check! 

The list goes on.

While i was really happy to find a source for fried chicken closer to home, I will definitely be making the slightly longer trip to Babe's in the future when the urge strikes.  Everything I tried (fried chicken, yams, mac and cheese, greens, pigs feet) on this trip was excellent, and they were super friendly despite being swamped with xmas catering orders.  

Stumbling across Babe's was an awesome surprise."}
