{"text":"Nice pub.  Try their wings and fries... Really good  Also a good selection on tap beers"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a couple colleagues. The burgers are homemade (not frozen) and the fries (we tried the sweet potato and yukon gold) are great. The burger was composed of two smallish patties on a large brioche bun. I'm not really a fan of a brioche bun, but that's just my personal preference. The taste of the burger was nice and beefy and well seasoned, but it was slightly overcooked for my liking.   The crowd of regulars around the bar when we got in appeared to be manufacturing types. We initially felt a touch out of place, but the waitstaff was super nice and the food was good so I would definitely come back. They have a large selection of burgers on their menu, so there's definitely something for every burger lover."}
{"text":"The owner Tony is good people Staff is pleasant though service is a bit lacking unless you're at the bar Food is good Wish they had more pool tables. Pricing is reasonable for a bar"}
