{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Only place where you can get some bacon, eggs, homefries and coffee for under $10! I come here all the time because it's so cheap and good!  The place is cute, like a classic diner, and the server Betty is a sweetheart.  Don't let the plaza fool you! The unfortunate part is it's located in a small plaza next to an adult video store."}
{"text":"Go back in time, for great quality & simple food, warm family service, and great prices.  Classic diner, booths, juke boxes at every table.  Owners have been operating this place for over 60 years.  I wish I'd discovered it years ago - it's a \"meet me half way\" place for a friend and me - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We go there at least once a month for breakfast you can't beat their prices! Four people for breakfast Under $25~~ two eggs made anyway you want. Toast, bacon(or alternative choice but really who doesnt like bacon?) HOMEFRIES.. not the crappy kind either. BOTTOMLESS coffee... Betty & Bill make this place.. their bench seats & jukeboxes are authentic and often can be found playing! If you want a little bit of old school.. THIS is the place to go."}
{"text":"Quite *literally* the *best* spaghetti and meatballs I've *ever* had.  Fries are *pure* perfection!  Staff is homey, and quaint!  The esthetics are a blast from the past!  Authentic 1950's setting and feel!  Will *definitely* return!"}
{"text":"Few of these places exist anymore, a classic, actual greasy spoon restaurant, rather than some vaguely hipster recreation of one. Breakfast special is a great value and while it's on paper only offered until 11am, that timing is not hard and fast. The owners are lovely."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Awesome food and awesome atmosphere. It gives you the old school restaurant vibe and that's because it is!! It's been there for so long. The elderly couple that own this place are so precious, they are the main reason I love this place so much. Haven't gone to this place in a while because I have been busy but I went today and she still remembered my order!! P.s: this place is well priced for the quality, taste and atmosphere."}
