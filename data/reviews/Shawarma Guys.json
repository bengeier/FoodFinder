{"text":"Slow and gimmicky service. I was in line for 20 minutes and they often skipped over me when it came to ordering. I had the chicken shawarma but it was very dry and tasted very plain. Food was not made with love."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma sandwich was more of a lettuce sandwich.  Got a piece of gristle,  I mentioned the lettuce, other toppings were minimal, hot sauce is simple tabasco and overwhelmed taste with vinegar, was not toasted warm throughout.  Go anywhere else nearby if you want a shawarma.  Alexandros on Lake and Yonge St., Medina in watermark  are safer bets."}
{"text":"Nothing exceptional. Watch when they asked for sauces because they load them up. The prices are fair for the area however. Would return if I was craving sharwma."}
{"text":"Yikes. DineSafe has temporarily closed this place due to 12 infractions of  dining safe codes. This is not good. I will not be checking this place out for a while even after it reopens assuming it will reopen. There are many other options for Middle Eastern food in this city."}
{"text":"Moved into the condo above the restaurant this weekend and since I did not have time to cook and was starving, I walked along Queens Quay and stumbled upon Shawarma Guys. I ordered a shawarma combo (chicken shawarma wrap, fries and drink) for $8.50 before taxes. The order came out quickly and the shawarma and fries were a decent size.  The chicken was not dry, the condiments were good and the shawarma was grilled at the end.  Given its proximity to my condo, price point and quality, I am definitely visiting again."}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes of poor service to get the most underwhelming chicken shawarma of my life."}
{"text":"Shawarma at Shawarma Guys is of exceptionally good quality.

My wife and I whenever we go to Harbor Front for volunteering enjoy our lunch at Shawarma Guys. I am a vegetarian and love the freshly made falafal.
 
Nice staff/owners, efficient service, tasty and wholesome Shawarma"}
{"text":"In 10 years, I think I have only written 2 or 3 reviews on Yelp.  A place has to either really, really bad or really, really good to make me want to write a review. 

Unfortunately, this place is horrible.  The meat was all the left over stuff that you might feed a dog, all fat and parts of the chicken I couldn't even recognize.  I could barely eat a couple of bites.  I walked out of the place and threw it in the trash just outside.  

This place is in a touristy area, so they probably get a lot of traffic, probably have to pay very high rent and need to keep their costs low, so they probably buy the cheapest ingredients.  No matter how hungry you are, please don't eat here"}
{"text":"Located in lower level retail space with Subway, Quiznos, Pizza Pizza all right next to one another...Shawarma Guys is a great alternative to the typical fast food. When I visited, they were crazy busy, 5 people ahead of me, and a line behind me....yet I was in and out in about 5 minutes. Food is decent and fresh. A shawarma wrap and a drink was $9....cheap meal on the go."}
{"text":"Makes a mean wrap. The menu is limited, but you don't go for a shawarma and ask for a full course meal. 

They do plates, rice, soup, fries and poutine. It also wouldn't be complete without some baklava. 

The service is quick and pleasant. If you live or work nearby or enjoying the harbourfront it's a nice spot."}
{"text":"Efficient, quick service. Went Thursday afternoon for a bite to eat after work with two friends. All of our orders were finished within 5 minutes. I recommend the chicken shawarma (add tahini and hot sauce!) Sorry to say I did not ask the name of the gentleman who served us, but he was very polite and friendly. Struck up a conversation and even joined us outside to eat as we were finishing up and bid us a good evening. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Beware of this place. Complete tourist trap. 

Ive lived in the area for 5 years now and have only been here once. Once was more than enough - the shawarma is not authentic as they use poor quality ingredients and not enough at that! Not fresh and completely underwhelming. The owners don't care - they just want to make a quick buck off of tourists. 

Had had issues with food authorities in the past over cleanliness. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this but my experience with this place was very poor... I have tried shawarma in many places, this is by far the poorest one. It was quiet hot inside, hopefully I don't get sick. I have ordered meay shawarma. The staff tried to give the already cut ones, I requested fresh cuts since already cut ones would be dry and not sure how long they have been.waiting on the tray...He cut some more and put 4-5 pieces of meat... I didn't wanna eat salad since I paid for shawarma... Then when I mentioned this they opened and put a bit more. I was more like a meat sandwich then shawarma. This is my least rated review so far, but I need to be fair. I would highly recommend this place to raise its standards if it wants to survive in business..."}
{"text":"The beef I was served was a day old. It was in chunks and hard/dry. The pita used was ripped apart during  filling process so I used a spoon to feed myself broken wrap pieces. The other ingredients inside were standard. Overall it was not a good eating experience."}
{"text":"Really solid. I got a beef wrap with everything on it. Had amazing flavors. You can tell these guys care about what they do"}
{"text":"Came in on a hot day, and this place was hotter than it was on the outside!

We ordered a chicken shawarma plate, and it was very filling. The rice was a bit dry, but the chicken was very juicy!  The two of us shared a plate before we headed to a concert, and it filled both of us up.  The prices are $1-$2 more expensive than in the Downtown core, but considering that it's by Harbourfront, it's reasonably priced. 

Service was quick, even with six people ahead of me. There are a few tables and chairs outside."}
{"text":"We were able to easily walk to Shawarma Guys from the Delta while visiting. This quick carryout hit the spot nicely. We had the beef & chicken Shawarma plates and a side of falafel. The accompaniments like the turnips and tomatoes were fresh and the meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection. When on the run this is a great option in the area by the waterfront."}
{"text":"Ok, so I stopped at this place during their lunch rush and was highly disappointed.  The food was mediocre at best.  The place was chaotic, and not in a fun way.  I am pretty sure the register person was new, because they were clueless.  Overpriced boring lunch.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"This Shawarma is Avengers approved! 

I recently moved to this area and needed a new shawarma joint to quell my desires for some good ol' middle eastern meat, tahini, and garlic sauce. Right from the moment I entered the store, the owner immediately made me feel welcome and made sure that I wouldn't miss the old shawarma joint I used to be a regular at. He hasn't disappointed. The meat is tender, soft and juicy and does not disappoint. The signature item of shawarma poutine is definitely a must have and something I would recommend to anyone trying out the place the first time. 

The food gets made quick, and the owner is a great conversationalist and you won't even feel the time fly by. He'll also go the extra mile to ask if you'd like to add something special or have it customized in a certain way!

The prices are a little on the higher end, and the portions a little smaller for the price you're paying. Food is super oily, and I wish they'd reduce just a tad.. That said, the taste of the food, hospitality of the staff and the location where you enjoy your food (Harbourfront) are a fair deal for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Pretty good sharwarma option in the area. Working in the area makes lunch pretty difficult, many of the places along Queens Quay are less than desirable at best. This place does the chicken wrap very well, the veggies are always fresh, tasty sauces and great side options as well. Definitely one of the better options for lunch if you want something quick and inexpensive. The service is great, and you're guaranteed a laugh while you wait."}
{"text":"Two very good points: service and taste (and they use kale not iceberg lettuce) 

Two not so good: too little chicken (in my shawarma) for the price, and not enough tahini. 

Maybe it was because they were slammed on a holiday but still. Can't let quality suffer or this is what happens...."}
{"text":"Best shawarma ever And the staff were so nice!! The new owners are greatttt they changed the decoration , the recipes and its so clean and fresh !.
I loved the shawarma and shawarma poutine"}
{"text":"I'm a person who loves shawarmas. And this is probably one of the worst shawarma I've ever had. I got the typical beef shawarma wrap and there's barely any beef in there and they put this weird lettuce in there that takes a lot of room but 1) doesn't taste that good and 2) doesn't leave a lot of space for the beef!

Aside from the friendly service and location, this place is definitely a no go if you want tasty shawarmas."}
