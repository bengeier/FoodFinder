{"text":"This is best sushi place in Stouffville!! Fresh food and fast service, they have iPad orders, so the server carries iPad and simply tell them wat u want, they send the order through iPad, the food came within 3-5mins, nice and fresh, only the dimsum items took sometime to cook, everything else is great! Didn't took much pictures, cuz was busy with eating !!! Lol , Having a good time there with my frd! Lovely , will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food 4/5
Service 3.5/5

Let's start with food. First of all, the flame sushi... Probably the best I've had at an AYCE restaurant. Sauces are good, the rice to fish ratio is good and it didn't fall apart on me. Sashimi was also very fresh and they also have scallop!!! Scallop sashimi is my favourite so for me to see that on my menu, I was ecstatic! Cooked food was mediocre. But to be fair, I didn't try a lot of it since all I kept ordering was the sashimi and flame sushi. The rolls were also just a meh. The desserts however were really good. They have cheesecake, which was served in a small thin slice but it didn't bother me because after eating all that food, I wouldn't be able to eat a full slice. 

Service... I'm not sure how to rate it because my server was very friendly but there was constantly miscommunication problems between us. I specifically ordered a roll but she kept marking it down as another roll? I'm not sure. This happened twice where we received a roll we didn't order because she didn't mark down the one I wanted. Anyway, she took care of us well so that didn't matter too much. 

Would def come back!"}
{"text":"awesome AYCE place, and such a huge variety of food on the menu!!! I honestly found the sashimi really fresh and most of the food here above average. 

The service was great but the only annoying thing was that you had to read out your order everytime to the servers, which can sometimes take forever when you have to find it on the menu or you have a bunch of items to order. (would be much faster if everyone could order with an ipad or even on a piece of paper)

Overall, the food was worth it for the price point, and I was pleasantly surprised by its quality."}
{"text":"It was so gross. Worst ayce ive ever been to. Low quality fish, rice was hard, the only thing that was good was the service. Save ur money go elsewhere"}
{"text":"We tried Senjyu for the first time tonight. We were very happy with the food and service. The flamed sushi is a nice twist from the AYCE sushi Restos. Senjyu had  practically all our favourites when we go for AYCE sushi. The shrimp tempura and crab wontons are delicious. Herman, our server was super nice. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I found this new place in town, All you can eat sushi place,I love there's Flame sushi tasted really good! Very close to my house 5min walking to my house, will go back soon. By the way the sever is pretty happy to see you there I feel welcome when I first go there :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, not great food, poor English to communicate with, got many wrong orders.
They have some different items from Makizushi in town, but that's about it. (No iPad order here.) Although Makizushi isn't the greatest sushi restaurant either, we won't go back to Senjyu again, not worth the money."}
{"text":"This is our go-to AYCE sushi place. The selection is great, quality is great too and they're always friendly (even when the kids make a total mess)"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a tues and everything was pretty bad. The sushi was the thinnest sliver of fish (like deli meat) with way too much rice. The hand rolls were terrible as the seaweed was not crispy and really difficult to chew through. Tempura was way over battered. The kalbi was sliced super thinly as well. Completely diff than what's pictured in the menu"}
{"text":"High Expectations = High Disappointment

Went here with my wife to celebrate her birthday. We both had high expectations which we now regret having. Let me explain...
- normal price is $24.99 per person during the week days and $26.99 during the weekend and holiday. Well some how one week before Christmas is consider to be the holiday. So we end up paying for $53 for two... we didn't mind if the food match up to it...
- the mango salad look like a 5 year old put it together. Color of the greens and mango was more gray then it's original color.
- seaweed salad was so salty.
- Sashimi was half frozen and half mushy. They put it on a bowl of ice like it's not frozen enough...
- Maki was a massive roll of rices...
- the beef Sashimi was completely tasteless
- the tempura was cover with thick batter
The only two good thing was the eggplant and ice cream. We order two drinks and the final bill came up to $70 +tip (the only reason why I gave $7 was because the waitress was cute).

At the end of the night me and my wife end up paying $70 to sit on the toilet for an hour...

Sorry we ain't coming back.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Great food, speedy service, recommend flame sushi. Desserts are great, this is a go-to place if you live in Markham and think Ka Ka got too long a line. I mean seriously this place is no different in terms of food quality. Maybe the interior is a bit diner like but don't let this fool you, it's got great food. 10-20 minute drive up from Markham, totally fine."}
{"text":"I finally got to this restaurant after my wife and 11 year old recommended it. The overall impression is quite good and definitely better than the other options in Stouffville. The decor is clean and pleasant. The service on a Friday afternoon was attentive and reasonably quick. But we are here for the food and while it is does not hit the top notch notes, it comes pretty close. The sushi and rolls are as good as they come. The Sashimi for some cuts did not hit the mark and came in much smaller servings than other restaurants. Not a big deal once you figure it out but can be a surprise on the first dish. It's a little pricey on a weekend for AYCE but I would return midweek when it's a better value. The service was excellent. I would recommend."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi and it is good stuff! Started with hot tea and some apps. $27 and I did take advantage of the all you can eat. The portions were just right. Had the teriyaki squid 2x so good. Get the shrimp on a stick, golden crunchy and buttery, yes just eat the whole thing. I tried the flamed sushi and have to say that the grilled bit of sushi rice under the fish gave it a real burst of flavor. Earlier in the day I had noticed that the place was hopping around lunch time. Fear not, there is ample seating for dining and a nice bar area. Only one roll for me, the BBQ eel with cucumber average...
I will be back when in the area for sure."}
{"text":"I usually order their take out as the lunch special prices are attractive. I like their food , it's fresh and easy to order online or on phone."}
{"text":"First time trying this place because they have a 20% off take out. So I ordered the lunch special Bento box but the girl at cashier only gave me a 10% discount because she said the 20% does not apply on lunch special. Then I told her your flyer doesn't have any indication that lunch special can't have the 20% even though the flyer said take out can have 20% and she doesn't care that it's their mistake. So anyways, bought the food home. I ordered the shrimp tempura bento, portion isn't big and definitely can finish it all. The taste is not bad, just not enough food for me. Please remember there is extra $3 for dinner time on the lunch special menu. I don't think I will come back anytime soon since I have other choice around the area. Also ordered a salmon box set and again food isn't bad just not enough food. Ok portion but paying extra $3 because it's dinner makes me think I'm being ripped off. Not sure if they give more before you paying extra but I'm not very impressed so far."}
{"text":"Love this place and service was amazing, Henry explained their signature rolls and made some nice recommedstions.  Stouffville needs a place just like this."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review, rounded up to four stars.

My family came here after receiving some coupons in the mail and we were excited to try them. Came here on a Friday night, so we paid the weekend price ($26.99 for adults). Lots of menu items to choose from and I was surprised to see scallops and squid on the sashimi menu (for the weekend)! Not something you usually see at all you can eat restaurants.

They also have a variety of torched sushi. The torched sushi was average, they use the same style and sauce for each one so the variety wasn't as good (unlike Kaka). There was also a lot of rice with the torched sushi, which is to be expected from an AYCE place I guess. I would have preferred slightly smaller pieces. The rest of the sushi and sashimi we ordered was really good and really fresh.

The cooked foods were tasty as well. Their shrimp tempura is very well done, with a light flaky tempura batter. They also have a shrimp skewer that's really good. Senjyu also does drink specials every day, and on Fridays it was $1 off beer, so not a bad deal if you wanted a drink. The day we went, they also had oysters on special so we each got a raw oyster on the half shell. Not bad!

Definitely willing to come back again. The service was quite good for an AYCE place so I enjoyed myself immensely."}
{"text":"I tried Senjyu in the first few weeks it was opened and wasn't a fan.  Because it's been so long I went back hoping to see improvement.  (It's right around the corner from me so I really wanted to like Senjyu!)

The food was hit and miss.  I'll list some of the items below.

Sashimi/nigiri- fresh fish but nigiri had way too much rice
Wonton soup- very bland broth, ok wontons
Sui mai- horribly dry and a little tough
Calamari- really good!  Loved the breading and the calamari was cooked perfectly!
Red curry beef- flavorful, and pretty good
Chicken karage- dry and bland.  I had to salt them
Mini cheesecake- ok.  About the quality as the Mandarin
Creme brûlée- bad!  The top only had 1/4 caramelized sugar on top and it was pretty bland.
Mocktails- surprisingly good!  Not too sweet but still flavorful

Service was pretty good.  The staff was sure to clear our plates regularly and prompt with taking our orders.

As super convenient as Senjyu is, I'm horribly disappointed that I won't be going back.  There aren't enough items to be worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite ayce sushi places in the GTA! The sashimi is so fresh and they slice the fish perfectly so it's not too thick or too thin. I would recommend their scallop sashimi and sweet shrimp sashimi, they are served on ice which helps bring out a very clean, mildly sweet taste of the ocean. I thought the icecream was just a tad icy but dessert is dessert so I would still order it next time. We came on a Wednesday night and it was not busy but we found it difficult to find a server when we needed one. The servers are friendly and the restaurant experience overall was great so come hungry and get ready to fill up!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch. The menu is disappointing because there aren't many options during this time frame. A staple at any AYCE is the kalbi beef short ribs which was not on this menu. I would recommend not coming here for lunch maybe try the dinner menu. 

The ice cream on the dessert menu is delicious but that's about all you get. The creme brûlée and the mango pudding is on the dessert menu. 

On a positive note the staff is friendly and the restaurant appears clean. 

I would not come back to this establishment I would go to Maki Zushi across the street."}
{"text":"Not a big restaurant but sufficient enough in the Town of Stouffville. Not bad. Great service. If enjoying AYCE, I recommend the sashimi and tempura dishes. Certain fried dishes such as the scallops or the gyoza are meh."}
{"text":"Came here twice in 7 days as they had good customer service, food was delicous for an AYCE and they were fast. Flame sushi was very good. The noodles flavouring can be done better (pretty plain) but we would totally go back none the less. Slightly cheaper than other places which makes us feel good."}
{"text":"Hubby decided to book a table for Valentine's Day. It was near our house and we wanted to give it a try. 

We parked in the parking lot, but realized the door we entered on the side was only for the bar area. (Yes they have a small bar!! :P) Walked to the other side where the main restaurant was. 

We were than seated at our reserved table. There was a long stem rose on the table, which was quite nice :)
Our waitress was very courteous and very friendly. Items on the AYCE are ordered by pieces. Portions are very small, but that's good, so we can try a lot more variety of things. 

Loved their sashimi presentation. It was all layed out nicely on a bed of ice. It was extremely fresh A++++
Beef Tataki was excellent as well! Their flame sushi (torched) was good as well. Usually only available during weekends only, but today was Valentine's Day (Weekend Price $26.99/per person) I love the squid one the most & second was the butterfish. 

They are Asian fusion so on their menu there are items like:
Ha Gow
Siu Mai
Lemongrass Chicken
Kong Pao Chicken
Etc..
I tried their Ha Gow for fun. And it wasn't bad! 
They also had a special promo for bubble tea $2.99 (Reg. Price $4.99) I tried the Original Milk Tea, it was quite nice in flavour and the bubbles were well sweeten and was cooked to the perfect chewiness.

Shrimp Tempura: Was also a plus! Their tempura batter is the legit kind! Nice and Flaky and Crisp to Perfection!

Chicken Karaage: Was ok, hubby thought it was bland in taste, but I thought it was ok for me.

Fried Chicken Wings:  I like the seasoning, but the batter was a little bit hard. 

Bbq Eel Sushi Pizza: it was soo cute and small..it could fit the palm of your hand. It was tasty and the pizza rice part was fried nicely.

Soft Shell Crab Roll: Nice Presentation. Taste was also on cue!

Deep Fried Gyozas: Was kind of dry inside and very starchy tasting..didn't like it.

Takoyaki Balls: Wasn't bad taste was tbere.

We tried also a variety of desserts:
Fried Banana: (Only 1 Thin Slice) But it was good for a Taster. I liked it but my hubby didn't. He said it was Meh and wanted candied bananas instead.

Coconut Ice Cream: Oh it was soooo good! Intense coconut flavour bursted inside my mouth! Love it! 

Cream Puffs: Was not bad, but I have a feeling they were just store bought.

Mango Mousse Cake: Nice Mousse and Came Texture. Moist & Fluffy. But I wasn't too fond of the Mango flavour..tasted artificial a bit.

Coffee Mousse Cake: Like this one better! Strong Coffee flavour and a light and fluffy chocolate cake base.

Creme Brûlée: Special Item for Valentine's Day. Ordered 2 but not both were torched the same. One was barely torched and other was torched ok but a little longer might have been burnt. Didn't like it cuz it was a bit overbaked. 

Overall, it was quite nice. Food was great, our waitress nice. Restaurant was small and cosy. Would come again to try other Items on the menu."}
{"text":"There's no nice way of saying this so I'm just going to be straight up honest in this review: This place gave me Salmonella. I hate for this to be my first review of 2018, but guess who had to spend her New Year's Eve at home running to the washroom every five seconds. If you want to get real familiar with the phrase \"explosive diarrhea\", then by all means, grab a seat at their table. Trust me this is embarrassing for me to write since the last thing I want is for Yelpers everywhere to read about how pleasant my current condition is, but I can not, with a clear conscience, sugarcoat the truth. I'm on a metronidazole antibiotic (Flagyl), prescribed by my doctor against the bacteria living in their WHITE TUNA SASHIMI that I had so much of. Please, do yourself, and your GI track, a favour, and go somewhere else.  

TLDR; Don't eat here unless you want to be on antibiotics for a week. This place is Salmonella central."}
{"text":"\"thought it was something special, turns out it's not. Not good or bad\"

So I've been holding off on putting u a review since I've had plans to come here multiple times and wanted to weight them all fairly. In a nut shell it's just another middle of the road all you can eat sushi place in the GTA. 

Atmosphere

It's in the old NYS steak restaurant which I've never been to but read nothing but terrible reviews of. Interior has a decent setup and layout but very reminiscent of a pub/steakhouse with a separate  bar area to the side with TVs. Nice neutral colour scheme and comfortable.

Food

This is where having 3 visits helps me rate this fairly. First time I went there was probably during the first two weeks they were open and I was pleasantly surprised. Pretty large menu with flame sushi, something i tried at Kaka sushi when it was new and liked. It's included in any dinner with special items for weekend. They have the standard rolls and a few special ones as well as a vast selection of appetizers, deep fried, and rice/noodle dishes to fill you up quick.

First time was great. The next two times over the next month or so not so much. You don't get very much more with weekend menu and the quality of cuts of sashimi is very bleh. Rolls have a ton of rice on them and are inconsistent in size and flavour. Again resembling many of the dozens and dozens of similar AYCE joints in the GTA. A nice selection of sushi dishes with many Chinese fast food dishes thrown in there to up the menu size.

Value

It's on the higher end of the price scale with $25-$28 per person ore tax. They don't charge an auto tip but during my last visit my waiter seemed to think my choice of tip wasn't adequate (around 12%) and reminded me that tip wasn't included in front of the rest of the diners. Having said that I was using a coupon where it was cash only and I should've had more on me.

Would I go back? Probably not. It's not good enough to crave all of the time and the very cost prohibitive. A la carte places in Markham would b a better value for the same money with higher quality construction. 3/5 with the extra because Stouffville always needs new places to dine and hope this place represents a wave of new dining options."}
{"text":"Food is decent for all-you-can-eat standards. Good selection as well. I'm a particular fan of their aburi (flamed) sushi. The bruleed tops bring out the flavour of the fish, and the sauce on top is delicious. I appreciate that they have options not typically found at all-you-can-eat restaurants.

Service is good too. But a bit expensive if you go on a weekend ($26.99).

Would definitely return with the family."}
{"text":"3 for the food, 4 for the service.  I was starving by the time I showed up here last night.  We ordered our food and I settled back thinking it'll be awhile. Our first orders came out within 5 minutes, and they just kept coming.  We had the all you can eat dinner.  The portion sizes are decent (the menu explicitly tells you how many pieces you get). The food was okay.  There was a lot of variety, but the taste wasn't the greatest.  For me, salmon sashimi is always a go to, but I was disappointed this time.  It had a funny taste that I can't quite put my finger on.  The restaurant also has pretty good ambience compared to any other sushi restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (2 stars)
Plenty of parking in the plaza. The actual entrance faces Main Street, but there is a side door that leads through the bar. Dimly lit, western pub style booth seating in the restaurant are probably the remnants of the previous establishment. We were seated by the window which emanated cold air. I sat away from the sill as it looked dirty. Restaurant was pretty empty on a Thursday night, probably only had 4-5 tables when we arrived at 7pm.   

SERVICE (3 stars)
Not much service to speak of. The waiter took our order on her tablet (incorrectly, I might add) and left. No one came by to check how we were doing all night. Food was set on the table quickly and efficiently. 

FOOD (2)
The cooked items we ordered were pretty bland. We ordered, among other things: chicken karaage, salmon belly, chicken wings, and chicken pad thai. Nothing seemed seasoned/marinated. A bit of salt and pepper prior to deep frying/cooking would have been greatly appreciated. In their current state, no one at our table finished their food. The tempura battered items were oily. Sashimi/raw fish items were okay but not remarkable. I do commend their octopus menu items as it's not widely offered at other sushi restaurants. Unfortunately, there was too much rice in the sushi but the rolls were okay. The green tea ice cream was not good quality but the coconut ice cream was good. The coffee cake we ordered was dry and didn't taste fresh. Mango yogurt was standard fare. Water tasted faintly of dish detergent.

QUALITY/VALUE (2)
At $27.99/person for disappointing food and minimal service, I think Senjyu is overpriced considering also their location. Pop is an additional $2/person, refills free. I don't think I will return. 

OVERALL
2 stars"}
{"text":"Food is a 3, the service gives it the additional star.
The family and I went recently for the first time.  Entry is a little confusing.  The main seems to be street side but there is a side entrance into the bar area with a walkthrough to the dining room.  Was this a Swiss Chalet at one point?
Menu is extensive, ordering on an ipad, food comes quickly and the empty dishes are cleared promptly.  Particularly enjoyed, dynamite roll, karaage chicken, takoyaki, tempura shrimp, sweet potato fries though everything is uniformly good.  Kalbi was a little fatty but the taste was good.  Curry a bit bland.
Prices are high: $24.99 Mon to Thurs for dinner so go there ready to eat."}
{"text":"Service is good. But lacks on selection and quality.  Only reason I do all you can eat sushi is because my kids like the experience.  I'm not much of a fan. The sushi has come to our table still a bit frozen in the center."}
{"text":"So far, I think this is the best AYCE sushi restaurant in York Region. On weekday nights, it is priced at $24.99 and on weekend nights, it is priced at $26.99. For what you get, the price is reasonable. Kaka, for example, is way more expensive but Senjyu basically offers what Kaka offers but the difference is, Senjyu tastes a whole lot better than Kaka.  

The ambiance at Senjyu is great. The restaurant is spacious and the waiters/waitresses are attentive. What I like the most about this place is that they don't rush you. At other AYCE sushi restaurants, I feel rushed. The restaurant also accepts debit/visa, making it convenient. They also have a patio outside, which is something different. 

The food at Senjyu is pretty good for an AYCE restaurant. You cannot walk into an AYCE restaurant with \"a la carte sushi\" expectations, it just doesn't work that way. The rolls here actually tasted good. On the weekends, they serve red tuna and BC tuna sashimi, which is something an AYCE restaurant does not typically serve. Their flame sushi actually tasted decent and way better than Kaka's. The menu here is extensive and they offer many types of food.

I am definitely a fan of this place and would come here again."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience at this restaurant the service was too slow, the food does not taste fresh. The garlic beef cubes taste sweet it has a weird taste. Their karage is very deceiving in the menu photos and when it was brought to our table it was small chicken dark meat pieces that is so dry. It was such a disappointment. Some of our orders did not arrived at all. I will not recommend nor come back. Perhaps when they opened the quality was good according to the reviews but last June 18 2017 the service was really terrible. And the food is not the greatest."}
{"text":"First time here. Took us 25 mins to get here. 
Didn't realize it was AYC eat lunch
For the price it's not bad 
The tempura was good. Hot and crispy 
Would've liked it more if they had the daikon added in the sauce 
The sushi was ok. I've never seen a handroll with one piece of sliced avocado and a piece of salmon put together this way. The seaweed was fresh but as you take a bite, it's quite chewy  See pic 

The green dragon was small but good enough 
Ordered the crab Rangoon (cheese wontons) very tiny pieces. The filling was good but the wrap should've been a lot thinner and crispy like the spring roll wraps. 

You can tell the food wasn't oily so that's good 

Service was friendly and our food came quickly 
If you can eat a lot, then this is the place. 
The place needs to be aired as it had a moldy smell too 


All in all it was a pleasant visit as I haven't eaten AYC eat in ages.  Plus it was a beautiful day so that helped!"}
{"text":"The best way to describe my experience here was like my last relationship... it started out great then went down hill.

Very casual ambience as it used to be a steak house. Plenty of items to choose from on the menu..  with very little items reserved for the weekend specials. The food tasted great! Presentation was amazing. 

The food was great... EXCEPT for the seafood fried rice... they clearly used frozen veggies... and well.. the veggies were frozen and still hard. We notified our server who took care of it right away. 

Then we order our desserts and my strawberry ice cream was accompanied by a stray hair of one of the kitchen staff... I brought it up to the server... they gave it to the manager... but they scooped out the hair because where it was situated in the bowl was empty

It was like they were trying to cover up there mistake. Regardless the manager gave us 15% off the bill.

Will I go back there again.... I don't know... maybe"}
{"text":"The staffs are very friendly. However, the food is not what I am expected. To be honest, the only reason I am coming to a sushi restaurant is sashimi. However, I have been waiting until all other dishes are done and then asked the servers twice for my sashimi. I don't like the way they are serving food. And the sashimi are not fresh at all. So disappointed. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Great option for Japanese/fusion food in Stouffville! This place is quite large inside with a lot of seating, both in the bar area and the dining area. The takeout menu has a lot to choose from. There are several lunch specials which seem like they are all really good deals. 

I had the veggie maki box. It came with a LOT of food! Everything tasted really good as well and was so big of a portion, I had it for 2 meals! 

Just an FYI to anyone who orders the veggie maki box and can't have dairy/is vegan, there is cream cheese inside the fried dumplings (not sure what they are called). 

I will most definitely be back. It is absolutely worth the price. They also take credit card, huge bonus. I think there's a 10% discount for cash orders."}
{"text":"Flame Sushi yes, it's great and probably the only thing that was good here. Everything else not so much! Lots of selection and 'premium' items, but sashimi cut paper thin and uneven, kalbi beef was too fatty and way too little/thin, tempura was okay. The nice plus is weekend dinner menu does cost more however there's special items offered, unfortunately all the special items are not very special at all. Crystal roll I could make myself at home, as with the special dessert items all seem store bought frozen. 

Ambience is of a steak house, like what it was before Senjyu. 80's 90's hits provide the soundtrack and it's quite a crowd pleaser. 1 star for flame sushi! If you can eat $30 worth then this place is a-okay for you! The service was okay and attentive so one star goes to them."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast. Clean. Nice people. Reasonable wine bottle. Great date night. Lots of big families- fish is fresh! Try Flaming Sushi Platter. Yum & smells delicious too."}
{"text":"is good nice Asian fusion
It's amazing I come here every 2 weeks and it's really good food comes fast service it's great and overall it's an good restaurant"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because it got mixed reviews. But I saw a 20% off coupon in the newspaper, so decided to give it a shot. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised! My favourites were the coconut shrimp, chicken karaage and the litchi jello! We ordered about 70 pieces of salmon sashimi lol! Decent quality sashimi (your typical AYCE quality). The flame sushi was ok, nothing special. I wouldn't order it again. The rest of the food was good, and the service was friendly and quick. We quite enjoyed our meal. All in all, a great dinner! For $25 including tax and tip, that's a deal!"}
{"text":"I think Senjyu is a VERY good and completely worth it ayce joint! In fact, compared to other places that have the same prices, Senjyu beats them in terms of freshness of their sashimi, variety, friendliness of staff and cleanliness of the restaurant. 

It was really nice to see their sashimi served on an ice bed as it made the sashimi stay chilled the entire time (and remain \"fresh\" as long as possible). They also have scallop, octopus, and squid and weekends they have sweet shrimp--awesome!!!! 

Their beef sashimi is one of the best I've ever had...though it was a little frozen, it still held up to my standards. They have some really great torched sushi, the butter fish and tuna flame sushi being my favourites. 

Their cooked food and dessert menu is not as extensive as the higher priced AYCE restaurants (ie. Tenichi, Kaka), but I really can't complain because they are well priced plus they have the same standard of quality and you get everything you want.

I'll definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Got some coupons in the mail for Senjyu so my family decided to try it out for lunch. I usually don't go to AYCE sushi places. The ones I have tried usually have dubious quality food and the service is always iffy at best.
Senjyu is one of the better AYCE places. Service was excellent, it seemed a waitress was at our table the second we picked up a menu. We've also gotten attitude from servers at other places when we present a coupon but they were more than happy to accept ours. Food was brought to us promptly and dishes were cleared quickly. Food was of higher quality than what we usually see in AYCE. Shrimp tempera, salmon and tuna sushi and various rolls were all good. Price was $16.99 per person for lunch and we felt we got our money's worth. We will definitely be going back.
FYI, coupons are accepted with cash only, just something to keep in mind.."}
{"text":"This is a very good ayce in the area. 

The food was very fresh, service was quick and the place was clean. They offer a variety of sashimi and rolls. There is something here for everyone. You can see the menu on the website I thought it was well worth the price for the amount of food that we ate."}
{"text":"Amazing Service, great food! The sushi was fresh! Loved it!  We tried lunch special another day and that was good too. The staff are very friendly. Definitely going back there."}
{"text":"We went to Senjyu on Sunday night around 8:00pm and we were seated immediately. Service was lightning fast, Joanna our server was so sweet and attentive. It is $27.99/per person for the AYCE and you get everything on the menu on weekends and holidays. They have some interesting things on the menu; we ended up having some sushi/sashimi and curry dishes, everything was very yummy! Washrooms good, lots of parking in the plaza, I'd personally prefer that they play some traditional music over the hip hop that was on, but to each his own. With some sake the bill for two of us was approx. $68.00 so for people who eat a lot I think it is worth the price. Compared to other AYCE places some might find it a little pricey but we will likely be back since it is the closest AYCE sushi place to us."}
{"text":"Went for all you can eat lunch about a week ago.Food was great and the service was excellent!It was nice to sit outside on their clean patio and have sushi."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi buffet!

Today we came back again in a very cold day! The service is great, food quality is never goes down either! And the place is very clean! We enjoy our night here a lots!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi, great quick and friendly service. I am impressed with this restaurant. I have been twice and I plan on coming again soon. Secret menu item: Beef with Broccoli (Not written in their menu, just a FYI)"}
{"text":"It's not because of the food, which is above average for the area. The restaurant is good and clean as well.

No, when we arrived the atmosphere was nice, but less than half way through the meal someone put on Asian Rap which totally spoiled the experience.

My wife and I eat there often, and because of this experience, I may not actually return. They need to understand that most people will enjoy easy listening music, but rap is very specific, especially Asian rap."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Sunday night. The service was fast. They have a large menu, there is lots to choose from for everyone. The restaurant is very clean. Once ordered the food also comes out fast. Good atmosphere. 
The only downsides the music is also and you have to  the server your order, you don't get to write it down which makes it difficult to coordinate in a large group. 
The restaurant can accommodate large groups as well. 
Overall a very good experience."}
