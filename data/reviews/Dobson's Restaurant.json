{"text":"Hidden gem. Great for breakfast and lunch. Delicious food, wonderful service, well priced. Assumed it was just for the golfers. When I found out it's open to the public I went tried it out. Been a regular ever since. Seafood omelette, filet mignon & eggs, & the club are solid. I'm a fan! My kids love it too!!"}
{"text":"Steak and eggs is good and a good value, my dad really enjoyed the breakfast quesidilla."}
{"text":"This is located on the Dobson Ranch Golf Cource property. 

A separate building from the main club house, it servces as the gathering point for all the golfers.  But it is also a complete restaurant.  They also do wedding events and other parties, but can't comment beyond that. 

As a HUGE golfer, I have learned to never overlook the golf course restaurant as a place for good food. Especially breakfasts and lunches. Want a good burger, dog, fries, wings, or selection of breakfast items, don't overlook your local golf course restaurant. 

The restaurant has recently been taken over by Lefty and his wife.  A nice couple who have been an integral part of Dobson Ranch for many years.  Now, they run the restaurant under contract from the City of Mesa.  I don't frequent the restaurant part, as I end of spending most of my time in the bar area.  As a member of the Dobson Ranch Men's Club, this bar area serves as the gathering point for the men's club golfers before and after rounds. 

The breakfast menu offers a variety of food. I have especially enjoyed the large stack of pancakes.  This is one of the best places I have found in the valley for pancakes. Forget I-Hop, Village Inn or the other chains, I would go here for breakfast over most other places. 

Also on the menu for breakfast are stuffed French Toast.  French Toast filled with cream cheese filling.  Will probably be my next tasting...

Have also had the hamburgers, wings and dogs for food during my many visits. Friday, had a club sandwich with fries in a to-go box on my way to out for a round of golf.  Now I will admit I was very hungry, but these were some of the best fries I have had in some time. 

Located just south of Baseline on Dobson Road in the Dobson Ranch Golf Course, if you are looking for a breakfast without any lines or waiting, stop by... I think you will find a new hidden gem for breakfast...

Only downside, it is a little more pricey than the usual.  But I think it is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"The smell of urine is strong as you enter the restaurant. Back in the bar area, it is still noticeable. I wouldn't have stayed, except I had already committed to meet a group there.

The salmon seemed like it had been frozen. The only vegetables were asparagus and spinach. The French fries, which I was told were fresh, were soggy and limp. I will not be going back.

Also, the entry/exit door was locked when I left around 7:05 p.m. I left through the kitchen. Not a big inconvenience this time, but isn't that a fire safety hazard?

I gave it two stars (rather than only one) because the server/bartender was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, Great price, cozy location, no waiting ... Perfect for a breakfast on Sunday mornings! 
Located at the Dobson Ranch Golf Course, they offer a full menu, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as a full bar. Staff is extremely friendly and courteous. I look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"I go here each Wed. morning for a business networking meeting, food is good, service is great.  It does not take long for our server Adam, to know who you are and how you like your food."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant for Breakfast.....I have breakfast here once every week!  The food is good, priced reasonably and the service is great!  Thanks to Adam, who always takes care of me.  As they say, Try It...You'll Like It!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Super tender chicken fried steak and everything was very hot.  Cold food that should be hot is my pet peeve.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for years and guess I thought it was private for the golf course..
Food was great no wait to be seated and our server was very nice (I believe it was Maggie). We'll definitely be going back now that we know. 
I had the corn beef hash with poached eggs and it was excellent, my wife orders eggs over medium and nobody seems to get it right but the cook here did it perfect!! I think the cooks name was Reggie and he did a great job. 
Definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Just had a great breakfast on a Saturday morning. The Greek scramble was fantastic. Also, when everyone is out golfing you can sneak in for a no wait breakfast that is hard to find on a Saturday morning. Service was fast and attentive. My only knock is a less than pristine restroom. A personal pet peeve. Otherwise it was great."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Sunday morning after reading reviews that there is usually no wait.  Sat down right away!  Really enjoy that this is a true neighborhood restaurant.  Great place for taking little kids as the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating.  No one minded our toddler playing with trucks in the corner.  Pancakes were \"damn good\" according to my husband.  I had the meat lovers scramble from the specials menu and it was great.  If you want something hipster and trendy go down the street, but if you are looking for a good breakfast at a great price that can accommodate groups last minute this is your place!  We will absolutely be back for weekend breakfasts."}
{"text":"Only reason why they have 1 star is because you have to put something. My first impression was not good I felt like I didn't belong here the waitress was really like she can care less. Very not friendly at all. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Very good food, good service and best thing is no waiting on a Sunday morning for a table."}
{"text":"Nice reasonable price breakfast, just right before a round of golf 

Staff are super friendly and efficient 

Will be back"}
{"text":"Came in on Friday at 515pm. No one in dining area. Everyone in bar so I assumed we would get good service. Got our drinks quickly. Ordered. Food was mediocre. Chicken Marsala needed more sauce and mushrooms. The \"vegetables\" on the side was one I chopped stalk of broccoli. The roll was hard as a rock like it had been reheated in a microwave. Yuck! The waitress had disappeared for so long that we were already done with our food when she came to check. My daughters food  was all wrong and she had eaten my broccoli and hubby's fries in the interim. It was too late to order anything else. Seriously. Come by and check and your customers. Not good food or service for the prices."}
{"text":"Was disappointed. Not sure if it changed management, but went there for dinner to have Fish and chips for Ash Wednesday and it was super greasy. The french fries were coated in salt and both my daughter and I couldn't eat them. I've had their Friday Fish fry in the past and this fish wasn't the same. I've had the worst stomach ache and was up all night in the restroom."}
{"text":"140pm on a sunday and dinning area is empty except our group of 4. There are more people in bar and in patio but didn't  check if eating or just having drinks. Most of the patrons are golfers.
They had a white board filled with their specials for the day. I had the country breakfast which is chicken fried steak with cream gravy with pan fried cubed potatoes and over easy eggs with toast.
It was great."}
{"text":"This place is a nice place to go for brunch, especially with a group - they're very accomodating even at the last minute.  Pretty view of the golf course from inside.  Atmosphere is a little rough around the edges, but the place is well loved.  The staff make you feel like family and the food always comes out fast.  The food is mediocre - never had anything there that was gourmet, but you can get a decent meal in a nice spot.  They do weddings and receptions and the pretty golf course scenery makes it a fine spot for a special occassion."}
