{"text":"The entire Nova Place (Formerly Allegheny Center/Mall) has been overhauled in the last couple of months. The result is a new and nicely decorated space with both indoor and outdoor seating. The Eco Bistro is a nice little a la carte lunch option run by Parkhurst. There is a grill, deli, pizza, salad bar and soups everyday with daily specials as well. I especially like getting the salad bar for lunch as it is not too pricey and I get to pick my own toppings. On average my lunch is under $10 and usually around $6-$8 depending on if I get a drink. For cafeteria style food this is a good fast lunch option. Easy to access if you work on the north shore or are visiting the aviary or children's museum. Staff has always been friendly and helpful to me as well!"}
{"text":"Eco Bistro is a decent place.  They are part of Parkhurst Dining Services which is part of Eat N' Park. They offer breakfast from 7am to 9:30 am and lunch from 11am to 2pm Monday through Friday. Eco Bistro is broken up into three cooking stations, Pizza n' At that offers different types of pizzas everyday. Sequoia Grill, which offers breakfast items such as pancakes, sausage, eggs, omelets, home fries and breakfast sandwiches during breakfast time and burgers, hot dogs and fries during lunch time.  Between the Bread makes made to order sandwiches and wraps with different types of deli meats, cheeses and toppings.   There is also a salad bar in the middle of the space were you can make what ever type of salad you want. There are also pre made sandwiches and salads in the cooler if you are in a hurry and don't want to wait. There is a Smoothie Station as well.  When Eco Bistro first opened the food was really good and the prices were more than fair now to the food is average and the prices are high. Example $6 for a grilled chicken sandwich. Eco Bistro was added to the building for all of the PNC employee's at the other end so I guess it's better than the alternative, Cool Beans which is absolutely gross!"}
{"text":"Those of us who work in Allegheny Center and get 30 minute lunches don't have many options. Eco Bistro takes advantage of that.   A few years ago, the food was decent and prices so-so. Somewhere along the line, the food quality tanked and prices kept increasing. Pizza was my go-to for when I didn't have time to pack my lunch. It was good, and only $5 for 2 big slices. However, they changed their sauce recipe and it's way too sweet now and just gross. The cheese is sparse now and half of the time it's burnt or stale. The chicken ranch pizza is about the only acceptable pizza option left. And FYI, never NEVER order the BBQ pizza. Their \"homemade\" BBQ is heavy on the ketchup taste. Nasty.  The cooks/servers can be a tad ornery and seem to not care at all. Reviewer Ken A. is right about getting attitude when ordering something \"special\"...which is odd at a place seemingly designed to cater to MTO style food. And god forbid they do something wrong, which will be looked upon as your fault for making them do it again instead of just eating your cold panini that is missing cheese (on a mozzarella basil panini...the special for that day).   The salad bar is pricey...expect to shell out $7 minimum for a small container with no \"heavy\" items in it.  The cashiers are nice, but don't expect any favors, like, telling you that something is going to be an additional charge. Or if you get a pre-made wrap that has barely anything in it...well, that's just how things are, they measure that stuff. Deal.  The lines are SLOW. If there is more than two people in line for food and you are in a hurry, forget it. 10-15 minutes easy to get a burger or wrap at peak lunch times.   Overall, this place is all phoney facade... The environment and prices suggest high-end, you know, BISTRO food, but instead you get the equivalent of some crappy food stand at a state park.   I guess I should thank them though, because they have saved me a lot of money...I always remember my lunch now."}
{"text":"worst place. . do not even try..ppl working in Allegheny center do not have many options and i believe this is the last hope to eat before they die. that's when they do business. i go well prepared for lunch or try to drive a bit to get something better.. eat here only if you have no ither option."}
{"text":"Wowza, some of these other reviews are just harsh and I feel unwarranted. I typically wouldn't take the time to review a place like this, but I felt obligated. It's an upscale cafeteria style set up owned by the Eat'n'Park Group, with cafeteria pricing. I find the pricing is reasonable- The special sandwich (today was turkey, bacon and Brie) is 7.99 and includes a side and drink.  They serve salads, sandwiches, pizza and a have a griddle. Not sure what people are expecting for 7 dollars. They mix it up with specials each day and I have found the staff to be accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"It's the only life in a dead mall directly downtown in Pburgh...It's got that 60's bomb shelter chic to it and it's just weird walking in because there is NO LIFE here...A mall downtown? where you have to pay to park at it? Compared to the Galleria you can find a parking meter and throw a buck in and enjoy SOME life in a downtown mall..."}
{"text":"The Eco Bistro is the only lunch option (other than a coffee shop that also has some lunch items) inside the Allegheny Center Mall.  When workers inside the mall don't feel like venturing onto the somewhat scary East Ohio Street for lunch.  The Bistro opens at 7 for breakfast.  There are daily specials along with the staples (bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes, breakfast sandwiches).  There is also an \"express\" buffet that charges per pound and features items such as corned beef hash, potatoes and ham.    Lunch features a made to order sandwich station, a pizza/salad station, soup, salad bar and a grill.  The grill has items such as burgers, chicken, hot dogs and fries along with a daily special.  Prices can add up and be high unless you get one of the special combos and the food can be hit or miss.  There are plenty of tasty entrees and sometimes there are unique items, but recently, the menu seems to have a lot of repeats of \"easy\" dishes like chicken fingers.    Overall, not bad and I enjoy the convenience but wish the prices were a little lower."}
{"text":"It shouldn't be so expensive, but I think they figure since there aren't many places to choose from, people will buy there. And they do. I think I bought a bottle of iced tea  for almost 3 bucks! Oh well. But then I discovered the city fresh pasta down the hall! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Watch you don't get shanked by the servers, not really personable! You'll get the evil eye if you order something out of the norm!  Great job parkhurst!  Makes me think twice on eat n park after seeing this monstrosity!"}
{"text":"I don't even know why I try to go here. This is one of the only options for people who work in the building and it's awful. It's sad because I feel like it's improved a little over the past couple months but it's still upsetting. The prices are just WAY to high for what you're getting. I just wanted to grab a very quick lunch so I went to the salad bar and paid $10! It was just lettuce, black olives, cheese, a couple shreds of carrots and dressing. When the cashier was ringing me out I was shocked about the price and then she told me that \"I should just go somewhere else then\" . My friend and I were flabbergasted!              I'm pretty sure it's catered by Parkhurst, which is owned my Eat N Park. It doesn't make sense that my salad would cost $10 but I can go to Eat n Park and have an all you can eat buffet for $6.99. I hope this place closes down soon, It's definitely a lot less busy than a few years ago. Hardly anyone that works with me will go down there anymore. It's very sad, they have a perfect location."}
