{"text":"Average but best values per dishes.  7 adults can eat Sunday lunch for $55 includes tax and tip. The lunch was made up of 6 dishes and 5 pop or tea or coffee."}
{"text":"Chairs are worn and dirty. They lay the round tables with the white plastic sheets.  Space can be tight sometimes on weekends when they try to squeeze as many ppl as possible.  Waitresses are typical Asian women but IMO not rude like other Asian restaurants which was a pleasant surprise.  Food is so so and loaded with MSG. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Taste of the dishes are terrible/ Rather pay a little more than have good food Will not come back.."}
{"text":"Quick and dirty restaurant. Cheapy food, finish and go. HK style tea is delicious, but horrible washroom."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight, as it was recommended by a friend. The place is pretty plain and most of the dishes are written in chinese on the walls. Lots of dishes are inc tax and steamed rice.  We ordered half a free range chicken, steamed tilapia, shrimp paste tung choi, chinese brocolli, maggi shrimps and a casserole pork belly dish. The food was decent. The tilapia fish was at least 2 1/2 lbs and was only $16.50 inc tax. Would cost nearly that much to purchase it raw at the supermarket next door. You get soup of the day and dessert soup too. The place was quite busy with around 18 tables seated. Service was adequate, lots of tea and even plates got changed.  All in all a good cheap eats, no frills kind of place. Lunch is apparently very good value. Might give that a try next time."}
{"text":"Alton has been here for about a decade! I remember they opened right before I moved away from this area and replaced the location of one of the dimsum places that were here.   Definitely a popular choice in this area. There are tons of regulars that come in and just relax and talk during non-peak hours. We recognize the two business owners as waiters and waitresses of the place that was here previously - really inspirational of how they teamed up together to open a restaurant of their own (Good for them!)  I would say that the food here is average for Chinese food, but I'm giving it four stars because the price of the food is cheap! I mean, hey, if you directly translate the Chinese name for the restaurant, it's \"Benefits for neighbours/regulars/community members\"! (Okay, I promise it sounds a lot better in Chinese - or maybe I'm just terrible at translation)."}
{"text":"It'll do. Super busy Sundays for lunch though. We sat 6 people at a 4 person booth. That was fun.   It's lovely that we got free Chinese soup with our lunch sets. Actually, make that two big bowls of soup (an accident, most likely).   Ordered a lunch special they only had in Chinese. I can't read Chinese, so I'm thankful Esther  read it for me. I ended up getting the spaghetti bolognese and buttered toast combo, drink included ($6.50). Got a hot milk tea. The toast was toasted quite nicely. It wasn't just pasty and white. The spaghetti bolognese is not the baked kind with cheese on top (daydreaming about Metro Square Cafe Restaurant's. Oooohhhh. Cheese), but more a large plate of pasta with meat sauce on top. While it was fairly generous in portion, was the least acidic tomato sauce I've ever eaten. It was not tart in the slightest, and it needed more seasoning in general. They hide a small layer of frozen veggies (carrots and peas?) under the spaghetti bolognese, for those of you who are interested in your veggies.  Oh. The milk tea was quite nice. Fairly creamy. I approve (not that I know that much about milk tea).  This place is okay, but it's not something I would crave.  Logos note: long wait times. Fairly cheap. Can handle larger groups."}
{"text":"Alton restaurant is forever known as the restaurant that gives you free rice, soup, dessert, and is tax free. The food is a bargain here but don't expect too much. We have been coming here once in a while for the past decade (once/twice a year) and mainly for large family gatherings. It is simply solid yet unspectacular home style chinese food in the purest sense.   If you don't know Chinese, it may be difficult to order. There is only one English menu which is a stripped down version of the 'real menus'. Some of the waitress/waiters may be able to help but I haven't gotten that far. You can gamble on one of the set meals and that typically is very good. You can't go wrong with those. There's typically one or two veggie dishes, a couple of proteins, and perhaps a stir-fry.   So, what's good here? We have always gotten the steamed chicken and that's a staple. The crispy fried chicken is also good. I like the fried pork chops and shrimps here. We always seem to get the beef ho fun and the Cantonese chow mein as well. Those are done well. The more I think about it, nothing was good and nothing was terrible.   Service is quick and efficient with no problems, and you can always expect to be full and questionably satisfied after a visit to this restaurant. You can probably find better but I'll always be back for sure."}
{"text":"Honestly, you can't expect much coming to a restaurant like this. Worn tables covered in plastic wrap, dirty utensils, loud, bad service, horrible attitudes, etc. But usually a place like this will have amazing food that is totally worth it.   Not the case. Food is average and very salty. Wouldn't want to come back and wouldn't recommend it to others. Just keeping this short and simple"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and overall everything was very good.  Ordered a mixed seafood dish, cubed beef with onions and half a chicken. Everything tasted good and nothing to really complain about. The meal comes with soup and dessert (tofu pudding). The meal also comes with a bowl of white rice for each individual at the table at no additional cost. I later found out it is also unlimited white rice so you could order another bowl and they will not charge you for it.  Very good value as all the dishes we ordered were generous in size and tasted good. The bill only came to be about $33 After taxes.  Service was also very fast and pretty friendly. Only real downside is the most of the menu is in Chinese."}
{"text":"As someone earlier mentioned, you can't expect much when you come to a restaurant like this because here you get great value and it compensates for the service. You won't be able to find better value Chinese food than at this place, trust me. Although the store is rough, staff are always running around and busy, I really can't express enough that you get bang for your buck by coming here. What restaurant gives free soup, rice, dessert and is tax free?? The dishes are also very reasonably priced, most under $10. Not to mention they have a large menu of items to choose from, from HK Cafe style food to traditional Chinese dinner. For less than $10 per person, you will carry your belly leaving this place. I always find myself coming here and the food is always consistent. Service is quick as well. Really can't complain."}
{"text":"Alton Restaurant might be the cheapest place for lunch in the whole Scarborough!  $3.99 will get you a huge bowl of noodle and a drink before 5:30 pm, even cheaper than food court offerings!  Tables and menus a little sticky, Waitress throwing menus across the tables. This is just so cheap and dirty Chinese.  Great for a quick bite and don't expect gourmet food but this is cheaper than cooking at home!!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's hard not to because the price is affordable and the staff is friendly and helpful. The best part, of course, is their delicious homestyle Chinese food. I think they also offer free soup and dessert. What's not to like? I highly recommend this place if you are in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"I returned to this restaurant after about 3 years.  The reason why i never came back the first time was because there was a giant horsefly that i almost mistaken for a fermented black bean in my dish.  anyways, the unlimited rice option and line up out the door enticed me to give it another try.  It is quite mediocre.  the food prices are generally pretty good here.  but the portions do seem smaller.  Food is only a tad above Chinese food court quality.  But i guess it is still an affordable no frills family restaurant.    One thing to note is that i saw some regulars getting dishes that seem to be quite large.. when i ordered the dish it came out much smaller.   Not sure what that is all about..  Its not quite worth a 3 star but definitely doesn't deserve a 2 star rating."}
