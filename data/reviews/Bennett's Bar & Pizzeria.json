{"text":"The pizza I ordered from Bennett's was a horrible, disgusting mess. The cheese was sliding off, and it was ridiculously soggy. When I called to complain, the manager first asked me if I picked it up late. When I said I hadn't, he then said he had never received that complaint. He then hung up on me. This place is a joke with horrible customer service. It will be closed in a month."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood bar and restaurant in Strongsville!  Came in on a Thursday night. Nice crowd watching the Tribe game and Thursday night football. Robin and Karen were running their butts off bringing drinks and food to all the tables. Excellent service, no one ever looked thirsty.   If you've been here before, they will have your drink waiting for you before you sit down. The food is good, but the pizza is outstanding. Best hand tossed pizzas in Ohio!  Tons of cheese over a tangy red sauce. Meat lovers is crazy good. My daughter's like something simple, and can't say enough about the plain cheese or just pepperoni.   Burgers are pretty tasty, too. All of them come with tots. Try the Cajun ketchup for just a hint of spice. Sean oversees the joint and helps out in the kitchen when needed. The Steakhouse burger is out of this world. Saut√©ed mushrooms, onions and Swiss cheese, nestled under a horseradish sauce.   Yum yum yum yum yum.   Checked in again November 2016- better than it was when it first opened. Pizza is best in Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"Bilo has done a good job of this place since he took it over. The pizza is excellent and the other bar food is pretty good for barfood. My wife and I both enjoy the wings. Last night we tried the Sirachi- honey wings. They were really sweet with a little bit of heat. Another small highlight about this place is that the house music is not played so loud that you have to scream to talk to the people you're with. Maybe I'm just getting too old but dammit, sometimes it's just too loud at other places."}
{"text":"One of the better pizza spots in the area and they always have some good specials.  Great for kids or the pizza side or adults in the bar. To-go is quick too."}
{"text":"This place has the worst food in strongsville. Took my 7 year old daughter there yesterday and ordered the sliders special and a chicken tender basket with tots. The chicken was raw... I repeat RAW. Disgusting a really concerned with the overall health risk to their customers. Never again!"}
{"text":"I came her with my Mother, Father, husband and Son.  We had Wings, Pizza and Spirits.:)  I was pleasantly surprised with the wine selection since its a Bar.   It's a come back for sure."}
{"text":"I like their cheese pizza. Their pepperoni is a little too spicy. But their customer service is absolutely terrible. The middle aged woman who answers the phone and is the \"bartender\" could be a bit more professional.  I won't go back. I was going to use them for the super bowl but no thanks."}
