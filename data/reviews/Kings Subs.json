{"text":"Attention ATTENTION: I would give no stars but the Man was Kind that took out order.   Do Not Eat Here: 1) Signs of old Bread  2) When the Bread is Falling Apart 3) They tried to toast the old Bread so you wouldn't notice or taste the difference 4) Found a small bug on outside of Bread  WE WILL NEVER BE BACKKKKK, OUR FIRST and Last Timeeeeeee"}
{"text":"First time eating, except the fact that we have been waiting 15 min for a pizza and a sandwich, the food is so amazing, so exotic. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great sub shop, been going here for years. New name but same great subs as always, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great subs here. Just the smell of the bread is what hooked me. I WILL take this place over subway any day. Friendly staff and fast service. I hardly ever post reviews, but this place deserves your business."}
{"text":"I go to kind for carry out once a week.  The Subs are great (usually the Philly,  melt,  or roast beef). They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  The Italian sub is absolutely wonderful. We have eaten here several times and it has yet to disappoint.  I would recommend this place to any of my friends and family."}
{"text":"I so enjoy this family owned and operated sub shop. I normally get the Italian or a personal pizza but enjoy the pastrami as well. They are super nice people. Stop and enjoy"}
{"text":"Fresh baked bread, fresh cut ingredients. What more can you ask for in a sub shop. Very highly recommended Mom & Pop shop."}
{"text":"So the sign says NEW NAME SAME OWNERS. My opinion it should be new owners.  I stopped in because it was near my office and I was craving a sub. The communication with the lady behind the counter was awkward and it seemed like they were doing me a favor by taking my order and were upset and a bit pushy that I was unaware of their ordering method.   I was the only one ordering so I wasn't holding up the line, I placed my order and got my sub, I did not specify any condiments on my sub so all I got was meat and bread, I wasn't asked if I wanted either. In turn the sub was dry and chewy and with the prior service I figured it wasn't worth the effort to have them remake it.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I want to be kind, because this guy is super nice. I have been here DOZENS of times. (I worked across the street when it was Cousins, and down the block when it became Kings)   HOWEVER.............  The only sub I'll stick with is the pepperoni...ANYTHING else and you are taking chances! They just got pizza and they say they serve by the slice, but they don't really. My slice was way way ....WAY over heated. It took 15 MINS!! Which at the time was half my lunch...thank goodness it was only mins away from my job. It wasn't heated in a toaster oven, no way... it had to have been chopped off of some other larger frozen piece and heated in a microwave in the back.  It was unedible. I'd had so much junk that day that I was ok, but ugh...horrible.   The bacon I got on (can't remember the sub, but I remember the experience) was in 'chunks'... not slices...(??) Like it was off the cheaper parts of something.   I think he's a nice guy, but I don't think he really cares about serving quality. I was told by someone once, that the reason he renamed it \"King's Subs\" was because he wasn't following Cousin standards and pretty much had to buy out and disassociate. I think he just wants to work  and make money and is willing to serve crap because he knows the area is at a disadvantage for quality places to eat... :-(  Thank goodness I discovered a burger joint down the street.... wow... far far better."}
{"text":"Plain,simple,fast but good subs. Is it more expensive than Subway? Of course it is but if you want a true Deli sub then come here."}
{"text":"The owner of this company is amazing. On numerous occasions  I have called and placed a large order last minute for a corporate even and the owner had bent over backwards to help me out. If you are look for a great sandwich and wonderful customer service check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is great here and you have a lot of options! The pizza is amazing and the customer service is good! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for lunch! I had the gyro today and it was delicious. The owner is SUPER nice too! Support your local businesses!"}
