{"text":"I was looking for a good stylist, and after reading all the good reviews about Johnny G. and his claims how he cuts hair accordingly to the face shape, about his B.H. training, etc, etc. I made an appointment with him.  But, to say the least,  I have never met anybody so inept at hair cutting in my life. I have a thick hair and wanted a precision cut. He said he does Beverly Hills cuts, which shall be superior to any other cuts. The result? He used a lot of styling products, right after he washed my hair, and  made it limp, and it was hard to tell what was cut and what was not. I left the salon with a feeling that I got a decent haircut. Not anything extraordinary,  but OK. The horror story started after a couple days when I washed my hair and discovered that he chopped the top off, making the difference between the chin length of my hair and what he cut off about 5-6 inches. No layers in between! He chopped a little bit of the right side, but left the left side almost untouched. I am unable to style it at all, and have to find somebody else to fix it.  The price was steep, and he sold me a hair spray for another steep price. Even though he told me to come back for any adjustments I might need (!), I did not go back, as I was totally afraid to have him touch my hair again. My experience? A total rip-off.  My advise to Johnny is to LEARN a basic hair cutting, and when he masters that, maybe only then he can his Beverly Hills lessons. Going somewhere to observe other stylists is totally useless if one does not masters the basics first!"}
{"text":"All my life I've been told by stylists that I have bad hair - coarse and curly. I was even told by one stylist to stop showing him pictures of haircuts using models with shiny, swingy \"good\" hair because my hair will never be able to to styled to replicate the picture. So, I've struggled with my hair in constant search for either the hair stylist or the magic product that will give me hair that looks and feels like hair and a style that is modern, becoming and cute.  About a month ago I saw Johnny G on Midday Arizona - he was cutting the hair of a woman who's hair seemed similar to mine - coarse, curly and shapeless. When I saw the results my mouth literally dropped to the floor. Her hair was beautiful, the style hip and modern, and her hair was shiny and looked like it had a ton of body. I immediately made my appointment, which was to come in a month's time. I won't lie - I went back and forth many times wondering if I should cancel. Afterall, he's in Scottsdale and I feared I be paying Scottsdale prices. What if my hair is just hopeless and its true that nothing can be done? Well, let me tell you - my fears were immediately erased as soon as we met. He was warm and friendly - not at all like a Scottsdale diva hair stylist. He seemed to be genuine in his endeavor to really help me and my \"bad\" hair. He had nobody else in his salon and was able to completely focus on me. (I hate it when I'm shuffled back and forth because my stylist is working several clients at the same time.) Johnny G worked absolute magic on my hair. For the first time in 50 years, my hair looks and feels like hair. He barely cut anything from the length, but the precision layering he did was nothing short of miraculous! He used 2 products on my hair - that's it - 2! (Instead of the 5 I've always used.) The result - I finally have the shiny, swingy hair I've longed for my entire life! Regardless of how my hair lands due to wind, due to my fingers raking through my hair, it looks phenomenal! At the risk of never being able to get an appointment again,  I highly recommend Johnny G. Oh! I forgot - his prices - no more than I've been paying at an Aveda salon I've been going to for years in Glendale. Extremely fair and reasonable."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to see Johnny G to get a new style.  I was nervous at first, but as I told him what I wanted, he took the time to show me pictures to reassure me what it would look like.  I was very satisfied with the outcome and I have received many compliments on the hairstyle from friends and coworkers.  I will definitely go back to see Johnny G!"}
{"text":"When he fixed hair, it looked great, but when I tried to  fix it, it was very uneven, just a bad cut. He is very very expensive  and talk a big talk, but beware, Not a good experience"}
{"text":"Johnny is meticulous about his work.  I have been searching for someone who can cut long layers in my thick coarse Asian hair.    Johnny took about 2 hours to cut my hair.  First was cut while the hair was wet, then he blew dry and flat ironed it so he can see exactly where he needed to place extra textures.  Once my hair was dry and flat ironed, he made final finishing cuts and touches.    He loves what he does and it shows!  His prices are also very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Johnny has an amazing smile and his space is very welcoming. He has all these modern touches such as TVs to watch shows or movies, an ipad to show you new hair cuts and color and he is amazing at doing hair."}
