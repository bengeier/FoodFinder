{"text":"Edit: 8/30/15 - just got my credit card bill for this restaurant. I had used a new credit card so couldn't put in my pin. Joe Badali's decided to add to their tip above and beyond what I gave them. I gave a 15% tip! I can't stand restaurants that do this. Lowering my review from 3 stars to 1. Congratulations Joe Badali's. You suck. 

Original Review: Having been here a few years ago, I remember thinking it was mediocre and hadn't been back until this week, where I was reminded how mediocre it is. 

I was here for lunch, where this restaurant has a fixed price menu (outside of Summer/Winterlicious). I tried this and had a Cesar salad which had nice and creamy dressing, the pappardelle alfredo which was pretty bland, and then a scoop of gelato. The gelato was vanilla and pretty good, however I wasn't allowed to choose what flavour I wanted. Is vanilla the only flavour they have? Overall, a pretty blase meal. 

Service was ok, nothing special. I like the design of this restaurant though, it's pretty cool, if you don't mind the subway rumbling below your feet every few minutes."}
{"text":"You're downtown, you're headed to a game and you need to grab a bite to eat before you head there. You take stock of your options and think, \"These places all look kind of similar - where should I head?\" Might I suggest you check out Joe Badali's, an Italian-themed restaurant on Front St. West, steps from both the Rogers Centre and the ACC. The spacious bar/restaurant has something for everyone, a key to success for large groups that often book parties there.

A friend and I popped in the other day to check out their fall/winter brunch menu. Given our choice of bar, table or booth, we opted for a cozy booth in the middle of the restaurant and were given three menus from which to choose our meal. A bit overwhelming, perhaps, but our waiter explained that one menu was strictly for their new pescetarian promotion where you can choose the fish you'd like and how you'd like it cooked. Feeling like it was a little early for ahi tuna, my companion and I went for the brunch options: I had the eggs benedictano and he had the steak frites, ordered medium rare. To accompany our selections, we ordered the pear and cranberry cider and the maple bourbon lemonade. (Both drinks made by the fabulous bartender, Katie, who also makes mean After Eights and Monte Cristos.)  

A plate of house- made bread was brought to the table, accompanied by olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Warm, crusty and soft on the inside, we polished off that complimentary snack pretty quickly while we sipped our delicious drinks. The wait staff is clearly comfortable with time crunches of customers and took into consideration that the tables around us had a short amount of time to eat before they needed to head elsewhere. The service was swift and friendly for them, while it was a little more relaxed for us  - though by no means slow or lackadaisical.
When our brunch plates arrived, we were eager to dive in. Neither my companion nor I had been to Joe Badali's in quite some time and wondered how brunch would stack up. The portions were a good size and, importantly, cooked as they should be. My egg yolks were runny and the Canadian back bacon was a great salty accompaniment. The ciabatta base was a nice touch, as it worked well to absorb the leftover yolk on my plate. The home fries might have been a bit crispier, but the peppers and onions were crunchy contrast to the creaminess of the eggs. As for the steak frites, the steak was indeed medium rare and had been rested properly before being brought to the table. By the end of the meal, only a few pieces of diced fruit were left in our respective cups.

Since we felt like indulging at this particular brunch, we allowed ourselves to split a very generous portion of white chocolate mousse cake with strawberry topping. Not overly heavy, it was actually quite a nice way to wrap up a meal. As mentioned earlier, we also tried the After Eight and Monte Cristo specialty coffees. Topped with whipped cream and a cherry, these were decadent and deliciously boozy. We allowed ourselves a few minutes - and a couple of glasses of water - before attempting to get up.
When asked about the capacity of the place, we learned that Badali's can hold up to 750 people, making it a great place for large parties. We also discovered that they set up a secluded patio in the summers, blocking off the adjacent parking lot in order to make it a pleasant place to escape the downtown crush. If you happen to be in the area - say, before a concert, a Leafs, Raptors or Jays game - check out Joe Badali's. You're bound to find something for everyone at reasonable prices. And if you're in the mood for a drink, I highly recommend checking out either the maple bourbon lemonade or pear and cranberry cider. Had it been later in the day when we went, I suspect there may have been a few more rounds of these!"}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for a show and went here for dinner. The veal marsala was amazing! It melted in my mouth. My son had the venison and it was also amazing good! We were disappointed they were out of the wild boar lasagna. I assume it's because it is also very good. The restaurant is very big inside and decorated like an old Italian piazza. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. Our water glasses were never empty. I love Italian and was blown away with the food here."}
{"text":"Food was not worthy of being called a \"ristorante italiano\"

The pasta was not fresh, chicken pieces of the frozen - barely chicken, closer to cardboard type - and the meatballs also not fresh.

The deep fried calamari rings were somewhat rubbery.
The mussels tasted off and had to be sent back. The kitchen had the decency to come out to apologise - apparently the mussels had just come in today.

$30 for a screw top bottle of wine ... enough said.
$35 a head - ridiculously overpriced for the quality of food.

Service - polite but insincere. Somewhat condescending but as is often the case in Toronto, became friendlier just before the bill came.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"My lovely wife and I just had a fantastic experience at the restaurant.The food was phenomenal and the service was outstanding. Overall, it made the night perfect. We will definitely be back next time we are in the city."}
{"text":"Our tour director recommended Badali's for dinner on 7/10/2016.  We decided to give it a try since we've never been in Toronto before.  We enjoyed Chianti wine, appetizers and our main entrees.  Kolos, our waiter, provided excellent service and the rest of the staff did a wonderful job in keeping our water glasses filled.  It was a pleasant dining experience and will definitely return when we're in Toronto again."}
{"text":"I visited the other day with two friends for lunch.  We used the Entertainment book coupon (buy one entree, get one free) but when they gave us the bill, they had tried to rip us off.  
Two of us ordered meals that were the same price and one ordered a cheaper meal.  They deducted the cheapest item, not one of the same-priced items.  I know that they deduct it manually and I think it is very unfair to deduct the lowest priced item because if just the two people had come, they would have had to deduct one of the same-priced item.  So, I bring them extra business with a third person and they scam me.  
Anyway, that wouldn't have even been a big deal if not for the awful customer service I received when I said I wanted the bill adjusted.   The manager, Wube came over with an attitude and asked what the problem was, even though our server had obviously told him why I wanted to see him.
He said that's they way they always do it and I said that's ridiculous; just because I bring an extra person, I get ripped off.  He said he didn't want to be \"argumentative\" but continued arguing with me, even bringing the coupon over to show me that it states that's the policy (it states no such thing).  
The food was okay, the prices were too high but were reasonable when using the coupon but the rude service I received would keep me from ever returning."}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver and I would say this an alright place.  Positives that we were able to make a reservation on a Friday night and our server was a delight.  Myself ordered the kale salad for my main which was tasty because of the craisins, but really something I probably would eat at home.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  Overall a good place to go but nothing that stands out to set it apart."}
{"text":"We were going to a concert at ACC and needed a nearby dinner spot. I used to go to Joe Badali's on a fairly regular basis back when I attended TSO concerts at the Roy Thomson Hall religiously and it was always a solid choice, so I decided to take my friends there.

The three of us were promptly greeted and led to our table. We requested a quieter area, and so it was -- the place is HUUUUGE, so there was a lot of conversation in the large room, but no music, and we certainly did not need to shout to be heard or anything like that. The place was lively without being obnoxiously loud. We all enjoyed the ambience, the decor and the atmosphere.

Our server was a chatty and attentive fellow who was able to make good menu recommendations and suggestions. He asked, of his own volition, if we were going to a show, and upon hearing that we were, said he'd make sure the food doesn't take too long to arrive.

To drink, I ordered a cocktail which combined lychee liquor with homemade avocado lemonade. It sounds like an impossibly odd combination, but it tasted really, really good -- refreshing, not too sweet, not too tart, and with enough subtle flavours to keep this odd bird very happpy. The others in our party got a beer and a Shirley Temple (which was on the house -- we didn't ask for that or anything, the server just gave it to us).

Next came the appetizers. The ceasar and house salads were passable, though nothing special. I had crab cakes, which came with a couple of interesting dips/sauces -- I kept dipping my bread into them even after devouring the cakes themselves. And yes, there was great warm bread, served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Others had garlic bread (all right) and squash soup (good).

For our mains, we all went with pasta. One person ordered the highly recommended squah ravioli, which was indeed a great dish. Another one had a little trouble picking her meal: she loves gnocchi, but all the gnocchi options came with meat or seafood, and she's a vegetarian. The server suggested holding the shrimp on one of the gnocchi (not only was he happy to offer that option, he made sure 5 bucks got knocked off the price of the dish!) He did warn us again the orange sage sauce that the gnocchi came with, and we later agreed with his assessment -- it was a bit too sweet for the dish. Nevertheless, it was still a solid dish; it was merely good, not great. Finally, I opted for a carbonara, which was quite well-executed.

The portions were not small at all -- they were perfectly generous. In fact, we ended up with a bunch of lunch leftovers simply because there was so much food (we ordered 1-2 apps and a main each).

We decided to get some dessert, since by the time we finished our main courses, we still had quite a bit of time left before the show. Because we were all rather stuffed, we just shared one slice of tiramisu between the three of us, and it was absolutely delicious. I had blueberry tea with mine, and the waiter brought me two tea bags -- Earl Grey and Orange Pekoe -- so I can decide which one I want to have with my drink.

All in all, we were all happy with our dinner. While the food is not stellar, it is quite solid, and the restaurant is just a nice place to kill a couple of hours before a concert. The fact that it's just so gigantic means that you're pretty much guaranteed a table whenever you show up, so it's a good back-up spot for the oh-my-god-i-have-no-reservations situation. Of course, it is very tourist-oriented, so it's slightly expensive and not incredibly authentic, but even as Torontonians we did not at all feel ripped-off, as you do in some touristy establishments. I wouldn't go here for food alone, but for a combination of food, atmosphere and proximity to many entertainment venues -- absolutely!"}
{"text":"1sr customer in. Lunch. Waited 30 minutes for pasta. Kids pasta, and mine (penne ) sauce was watery. Service good.  Overall would not come back."}
{"text":"Disappointing!  We came here for Winterlicious, Toronto's restaurant fortnight where participating restaurants have prix fixe menus at around $25.  The restaurant is very large and on entry you get the feeling it is a pub.  Further past the entrance you come into the large seating area which is more like a restaurant.  When we arrived at the hostess station, the hostess looked up at us but continued to finish whatever she was doing before saying hello!  While the waiter was trying to take our order, the busser ame on to the scene trying to pour water..not enough space for both and distracting looking around him to the waiter...training is missing here both for the hostess and the busser.  I had lamb shank which I found tough.  The others in my group were happy with their choices. For dessert two of us had bread pudding and one had brownies.  The bread pudding was rubbery; strangest bread pudding I have ever eaten...and I am disappointed with myself for having eaten it.  The brownies were inedible and when the waiter saw we had not eaten it, said it was a bad batch as someone else had also returned it! but to his credit he did offer to give us a different dessert which we did not do however.  We had ordered a bottle of wine..after pouring the first glass, at no point during the entire meal did the waiter come and refresh our glasses and nor did he ask if the beer drinker in our group wanted another...so one glass it was...on the other hand it was expensive so that was just as well!  So even though it was a $25 menu it failed in the promotion it was attempting to do..that of making me want to come back another time..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is all about dim lights and sports memorabilia, making this place seem like a classy but not too stuffy place for a date. The interior is very spacious for large groups (even for people like us who had no reservations on New Year's Eve), but can also cater to couples and families. Servers were friendly and knowledgeable, so be sure to ask about the pasta of the day. Bathrooms were clean and, interestingly enough, taught you Italian over the speakers.

As for the dining experience, the food was delicious and not that expensive given how some restaurants can upcharge simply for being in the financial district. We ordered:
- the Mama Cucina: a tier of three appetizers presented in a high tea fashion. The bruschetta was normal bruschetta, fried calamari was crispy and not overcooked, crab cakes a little bit salty but still savory.
- Pappardelle Alfredo: broad noodles with a creamy alfredo sauce, complete with freshly cracked pepper by the server. Would definitely recommend to someone with no fear of clogging his/her arteries.
- Kale Chips: crispy to the point of it crumbling in the mouth and tasting like sawdust, but someone else in the table liked it so who knows. Maybe it's an acquired taste."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being in town for the weekend and was looking for a place close by with Italian food. After a Google search,  this one came up and looked nice and sounded great from reviews prior. I was not disappointed!  The food was served promptly and with courtesy. My server had a great attitude and helped me make a fine choice. He took the time to help me through the menu and explain items for me. Even suggested a great wine with dinner as well. I would recommend highly and go back anytime I could. 
The manager stopped by to ask if I enjoyed things and he got the thumbs up from me. The whole experience was a pleasure after a long day. Be sure to check out the back bar and dining area. The old time decor is beautiful and pleasant. A Toronto experience for sure!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large seasonal green salad ($11) and meatball spaghetti ($15). The food was pathetic at best. The so-called large salad could barely fill a small plate. It was literally simply mixed with shredded carrots and nothing else. You could get a cheaper and high quality salad at Longo's any day. 

The meatball spaghetti was cold and dry. The so-called \"housemade veal-ricotta meatballs\" were crap. I could not even finish it. 

Avoid this establishment at all cost!"}
{"text":"The service was great - friendly, fast and informative.  The food was wonderful and a great wine selection.  For an affordable night out at a place with table cloths I definitely suggest Joe Badali's"}
{"text":"Went two times in the last 3 months both while on business travel.  I dined alone both times for dinner.  First time had the mussels and a salad and dessert  - perfectly cooked and really enjoyed everything.  Second time was tonight... the server recommended the special - pesto crusted cod over brocollini and crushed potatoes w a few mussels to garnish - it sounded ok but let me tell you it was the best meal I have had in a very long time and I entertain clients at fine ding very frequently.  Every element of the dish was perfect!  the waiter was attentive too.  Both times however the hostess was a complete B!  first time was just uptight and stand offish - second time was tonight, she was arrogant and rude then sat a single diner in a corner of a room with a party of at least 20 who were very loud not to mention the whole table vibrated due to close proximity of a refrigerator. Waiter recognized issue and without me asking suggested a relocation.  This would be 5 stars for food quality and service if not for the hostess which causes the 4 star review.  Plus my favorite wine that I rarely see out was by the glass, huge bonus in my book! Montepluciano!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. In the summer, they have a special menu as part of a \"Taste of Toronto\" promotion. I ordered fish on the advice of a friend I was dining with. I am usually wary of fish, because many places serve it either under cooked or over cooked. The Badali's kitchen got it perfect. Our server was very professional, attentive, and helpful. We ate outdoors, so I cannot comment on the state of the interior."}
{"text":"I had the bruschetta, penne primavera and the recommended paired red wine. Bruschetta was delicious, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella. Penne primavera was quite bland, for an Italian restaurant, I would've liked the pasta to blow me away.

The decor is clean and classy."}
{"text":"Everything was great until they brought the bill.  First they forgot to apply our coupon for \"up to $20 off\" then when they did, they only gave us $16 off because two of the 4 entrée's were less than $20.  

Even though we had 2 meals over $20 the waitress AND manager argued with us and gave us MAJOR attitude.   

Finally we had them split the bill to have the 2 entrees over $20 on one bill for them to give us the proper discount.  It's not the $4, it's the principle and the way it was handled. 

Sorry, you guys failed HUGE on customer service."}
{"text":"Save your money! 

Great location, and a good place if you want to pay for overpriced mediocre bland Italian food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great lunch here. The food and service were excellent. The manager even gave our table a free tiramisu dessert to apologize \"for the salads taking a long time\" even though we weren't waiting more than five minutes. Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Friendly service and atmosphere could be fun but the food was anything but good.   Pasta was cold, over-cooked, roasted veggie pizza had little vegetables and the 3rd plate (don't even know what that was) looked like a frozen dinner that was microwaved. All bland, tasteless and sad food.  I don't expect fine dining at restaurants like this but this was below all expectations.  

I really don't like to give a 1 star but the food at Joe Badali's needs help.  Major help."}
{"text":"Joe Badali's is another one of my favorite places for lunch .. not only because it's close to my office but also because Joe Badali's is one of the few places where you can actually have a decent meal in under 1 hour .... I have never been disappointed ... their pasta dishes very tasteful and portion sizes are a good value for money .... the only negative thing about this place is that it can get very crowded & noisy because it appears to be one of those places where tour bus operators drop off their passengers for meals ..."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing, food was even more amazing.
We can't wait to visit again!

{"text":"We had just finished the the WWF CN tower climb and headed to Joe Badali's for the dinner celebration. 

The restaurant is centrally located, on Front St.  adjacent to the Metro Convention Centre. It was a short walk from the CN Tower. 

If you didn't gather by the name the restaurant serves Italian food. The place is large and can host a corporate event of this size. There are 2 expansive dining rooms areas. The restaurant details 16' ceilings, wooden floors, hard wood tables, and walls rustic in appearance giving it that European look. Atmosphere - warm and inviting. 

Dinner was served buffet style in the two dining areas. I had a caesar salad, rigatoni, chicken cacciatori, and garlic bread. For dessert some melon. It wasn't anything I would come back for, but it wasn't all that bad either. 

I had hoped for soup, but as I got closer to the soup containers they were empty, I asked one of the kitchen staff, \"No soup?\"  he chuckled and answered \"Cutbacks' .. I'm not sure if he was serious or not, but I laughed back.

Service was alright, our plates were cleared in a timely manner and our waiter brought our drink orders in a reasonable amount of time. 

Culinary excellence is not it's forte however it's a good choice for hosting a large dinner event because of it's space and proximity to MTCC and CN Tower . They had no problems handling the volume that evening."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Good food. Extremely nice waitress who was very considerate of the child in our party. Best of all in the nicely decorated bathroom they play a tape that teaches you Italian phrases!!! I've never seen any other Italian restaurant do that! Very creative. Plus the provide nice hand soap, hand lotion & mouthwash. Will go back next time visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"I have eaten twice at Joe Badali's (because others picked the place) and it is okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at this restaurant. The food is very good, but its is expensive and the portion sizes are small. The restaurant is very large and nice. The staff are nice. Again it is good food, but pricey, so just keep that mind especially since there are numerous other options in the area that will give you more food for less."}
{"text":"Went here before a ballgame and there were other sports events and a major concert happening at the same time to the place was very busy, given its location. The servers were very friendly, despite how busy they were, explained menu items and answered our questions.

Not really fancy, more casual place. The arancini, the fried risotto balls are to die for. My friends raved about the pizza funghi, a white pizza with mushrooms. I had the salmon salad and it was great... usually worry about dried out salmon. The gelato was also on point. 

Great dinner place before a game or concert if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Visited Badali's twice in the last 2 weeks and both times the service was excellent. I felt that they really cared for the customer and the servers really knew the menu well. Where Badali's lacks is in its food and flavor. I was dissapointed both times with my pasta choices. I had the Torchio Speck e Funghi the first time and I felt the pasta was a bit under cooked and mushroom to pasta ratio was a quite low. And the flavor was quite bland. During my second visit I ordered the Gnocchi Pomodoro which was small in portion size and was a really unimpressive almost amateurish dish. For the amount of money charged for each plate which is on average 20 something bucks, the food is not memorable and the ingredients seem scarcely used and underwhelming in flavor. Their food game needs to be upped considerably if they want repeat customers and stay put in that extremely prime location."}
{"text":"Traditional Italian - so really nothing more to say about the place. We can dissect the food any way - but it is your good quality Italian. 

Positives - ample room and always find a good seat. Excellent service every time. What impresses me the most - prices. A really affordable Italian place. I've had days when I had pizza and a drink (wine or beer) and still escape under $20. Good luck with that anywhere else...

Negatives - food is very good but not great. If you want great food go to Il Fornello (5 minutes away on King) - but be prepared to pay almost twice the amount. 

Joe Badali's offers very good food, excellent service at a decent price. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went there after a convention, even with a 15%coupon, this was not worth it, extremely bland food, nothing memorable, and a bit pricey, the service was weird too, the server brought my wine by the glass in a carafe, with no glass, food arrived, but we had no plates, we were given small plates, only to have them change their mind and bring bigger plates,there were men clearing out the empty plates, reaching across our plates, in the middle of eating, if fancy is what they are trying to go for, you do not reach across a plate period. I will not go back, I would not recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"Tired of chains?  Joe Badali's is your answer if you are close to Union, ACC or Rogers Centre.  This location is huge, with ample seating and has a great atmosphere.

Service is sub-par, it looks us a while to get our order placed.  Food was a bit lack lustre, my caesar salad was not memorable - simple salad should be memorable.  Pasta dish was a huge portion but tasted average.  Dessert was a disappointment, my brownie was cardboard like.

Maybe next time I will try a non-pasta dish to decide if all their menu is average."}
{"text":"To summarize; good food, great service, and incredible decor!

I came here on a Friday night with some coworkers for Winterlicious 2017. I was surprised by the size of this restaurant as the decor was very retro with an Italian vibe to it. After our orders were taken, we received some bread, olive oil and vinegar (my advice is to split the bread in two and dip it into the olive oil / vinegar to let the bread soak in all the juices). We also got their Chardonnay VQA white wine as it was a Friday night and we wanted to enjoy our happy hour (lol).

FOOD:
For the appetizer, I chose the Butternut Squash Soup. It was delicious and creamy with a good mixture of flavours and textures with each bite. For the main course, I ordered the Veal Shank. The veal was very juicy and tender and melts in your mouth with every bite. I also added salt, pepper and parmesan cheese to expand the flavours! For dessert, I got the cheesecake covered with lemon and strawberry sauce. It was beyond my expectation as this was one of the best cheesecakes I've had! (Maybe the lemon and strawberry sauce added a bit of zest to it lol).

Overall, I enjoyed this restaurant! Given their wide selection and reasonable prices, I would definitely come here again to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Now its Winterlicious 2017, not normally a place we would go for Winterlicious to be truthful, as we go there three or four times a year otherwise,  and we had an event to go to, we figured let's just book a table. We booked for four people at 5.30 needing to leave for an event at 7pm (5 minutes' walk away so we were close by). The call came from Badali's two days before to confirm the reservation. I was asked do you have an event to go to? I said yes I do I am going to Monster Jam, after the lady caller snorted and laughed at my comment as to where I was going I know she heard me as she validated the information in her clarification response back to me before hanging up.
The day of, two of us were there at 5.30 on the dot, the other two were dilly dallying and turned up 5.40. Fine, we still have time, we order beers.  Beers come, we order food. The place is busy, we can see that, so we were told by our server not to order from the winterlicious menu if we were on a timeline, as the kitchen is too busy so order off the main menu. Fine. We were hungry and were wanting appetizers so figured to speed up the tine we will have everything come together after ordering off the main menu. We order simple things to make, not anything time consuming, again being aware we had an event to go to and seeing how busy it was. 
Two bowls of bread and two pitchers of beer later, we get told our dinner is on its way, panic sets in, the place is emptying, we want to go to monster jam, and its looking like we might be doing it without food. Then 1 hour after ordering, and 5 minutes before the event start time, it turns up. Not going to say there was anything wrong with it, but it wasn't great. Then it wasn't bad either. Actually I take that back, It could have tasted awful actually, I wouldn't know as I had to swallow it down like a dog with a peanut butter sandwich without taking a breath in between so that we could get out fast. 
Our server got the manager for us, he came along and to quote \"when you come to Toronto before two major events then you should expect delays in food coming to your table\". Two problems with this statement 
1. \"when you come to Toronto\" - we are all professionals who live and work in downtown Toronto. We were dressed in comfortable clothes given the event we were going to and not dressed in work wear, so that statement seemed to incorrectly stereotype us as being from outside of Toronto. I found that to be extremely offensive as what's wrong with coming from outside Toronto to go to a fun event, even if that's not the truth in our situation I found it offensive.
2. The two major events spoken of were Toronto Rock and Monster Jam, both of which were not sold out and from all of us living and working in downtown Toronto for many many years, can categorically say they are not what would be classed as a 'major event'. A major event for the city would be a sporting play off game or sell out concert. 
The manager leaves after telling my husband to quieten down as other tables can hear. He wasn't even loud, not to mention we were in a section with only one other table in at this time, and who I also overheard complaining to each other about the service/delay/food. 
Our event is due to start, where is our server? Hell if I know. We want the bill, we have to leave, our server knows this, the manager knows this, even the rude lady caller knows this. So we made an executive decision we would put our coats on and go to the front desk to pay. Our jackets are on, the server comes running like we are about to run out without paying. So I guess that's a tip if you want server attention in there, put your jacket on.  The bill came and the manager had taken off 25% to make up for our delay. Which is fine, but25% doesn't replace an apology (which we never got) and not acceptable for the manner we were spoken to and the lack of updates. If I had known it would be that long I would have gone to one of the many pubs in the area for my dinner. 
Like I said, I was reasonably regular to this place, and over the last few years I have had a few peeves with Badali's, the menu is smaller, some of the nicer items (in my opinion) aren't there anymore and portions are smaller. But anyway, thanks to my little annoyances about Badali's over the last while and then being spoken to like that, I wont be going back. neither will my friends who were with me, actually its lucky its me writing the review and not them as I am being polite and glossing over it, they would be much more scathing."}
{"text":"I ended up here 2x in my week of staying nearby. Both times the servers were excellent (which is why the 4 stars are given). The atmosphere is lovely. 

First time was supper time but I wasn't terribly hungry. I got the tomato salad with salmon. Delicious. Tomatoes were perfection. I also tried to order an old fashioned....I'm still not sure what I got but the server was gracious enough to take it back and take it off my bill. My friends loved that they sold wine by the ounce. 

Second time was lunch and I ordered a pizza which was disappointing. The crust had zero flavor and seemed to leech the flavors out of the fresh ingredients on top. My friends loved the gnocchi.

Service is top notch. Food ranges from acceptable to really good."}
{"text":"Location is good because it's a few steps away from Union station. The interior decor is nice and clean. The food was average. I had heard great things about their carbonara which is supposed To come with an egg on it but ours didn't. Apparently the head chef has changed and with that the menu did as well.

Bruschetta was good and carbonara was good..nothing outstanding. The service was alright as well. 

I did like that the washroom had mouthwash..kind of necessary after the chicken liver bruschetta we ordered lol

Oh and I thought it was cute that they had Italian lessons playing in the washroom- très authentic touch!"}
{"text":"Much bigger in size than I thought from the outside.  More casual bar in the front, more formal table-cloth restaurant in the back.  Long & narrow.  Tons of tables but I think reservations are recommended for the formal side, especially with larger groups.

Quick and efficient service.  Friendly without being annoying.  Food arrived within minutes it seemed.

Quite good Caesar salad with no bacon (good that again, I always forget to request no bacon as a recent vegetarian).  

Enjoyable cheese tortellini.  Not too bland like at many places.

The Winterlicious menu was on when I was there and the other three in my party ordered it for the value of getting the full meal for $25.  The California steak was said to be pretty good taste, quality & size-wise.

Afterwards, went downstairs to drink at the Overdraught Pub - so Joe's is convenient for that.  Many other restaurants and bars on the strip."}
{"text":"Back in 2007 it was awesome. We would stop by whenever we were in downtown toronto. I would order chicken basilico - breaded chicken schnitzel and pasta. Ohhhh it was so good.

But then I came again this year and wow was I disappointed. They changed the menu, they didn't have my chicken basilico
And terrible service from the waiters.

What happened?? Did they change managers? I don't know if it will ever be like it was before."}
{"text":"A solid alternative to the sports bars in the area, if you've got a game to catch and you're not in the mood for wings, this place should do the trick. We particularly liked the pizzas and healthy serving sizes of the desserts."}
{"text":"My bf and I came to Badali's for dinner last night and we had a good time. The staff, particularly our waiter, was very friendly and attentive. My bf ordered the veal parmesan and I ordered the meatballs with gluten-free pasta. Both dishes were delicious. The blood orange juice was yummy too. Surprisingly, the restaurant was not crowded for a Saturday night but we attributed it to the hockey game going on at the same time. But hey, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Went here our first night in Toronto. Good service, kids loved the spaghetti and keep raving about it. I had the penne bolognese and it was satisfying."}
{"text":"After a crappy comedy show at Second City Friday night, it was so nice to sit on Badali's patio and enjoy good food, good wine (thanks to our neighbouring table with Paul and Lindsay) and fabulous service. We had the caprese salad, proscuito pizza, and delicious doughnuts for dessert ... with lots and lots of flowing wine and conversation, we closed the place down. I'm not even a big fan of Italian food, so this was quite nice. And Paul, thank you so much for paying our bill: we hope we run into you again when you're back in the T.dot from the T.burg!"}
{"text":"Great environment and food. Everyone was super nice, especially our waitress, Jennifer! Plus, the pizza crust was amazing!"}
{"text":"went here for a drink and garlic bread off the happy hour menu before we went on a dinner cruise.  Considering it was dead took forever for the waitress to come and serve us.  I told the waitress that we needed the bread right away and asked her if we should get one or two she suggested one as it only takes three minutes to come.  We really never saw her again the only reason we had service is because we were flagging down other people to help us.  
Our bread? we waited and waited and waited ... apparently the kitchen lost our order? Holy crap we were shocked! The bread once it arrived was to die for.  Our waitress???? MIA apparently her shift finished at some point and she left lol

ok so we finally talked to a manager ... that server was apparently three weeks old and if they are smart they will not let her make it to four.

The flavor of the garlic cheese bread with the sweet balsamic drizzle will bring us back to try some of the food."}
{"text":"No complaints here! This was another place I ventured to during my recent weekend in Toronto, and I'd happily come back again if I was in the area - I'm all for supporting local restaurants, especially the really good ones.

The set-up inside is...interesting, in a good way.  The fresh produce decorations that they use throughout the place, combined with the food stand and countryside wallpapers, give the restaurant a unique look and feel that makes you think about the fresh food you'd find at a market. It definitely sets the tone of what to expect from a meal before you even order.

As for food and drink: the cocktail and wine menu they gave us offered plenty of options, a big plus - I went for the very sweet Apple Raspberry Pie cocktail option, which was absolutely delicious beyond words. If you ever wanted to drink your dessert from a cup, this would be the drink to go with! In terms of actual meal choices, the main menu definitely gives you plenty of wonderful options, ranging from classic Italian dishes to restaurant specialties. There were so many great looking choices in fact that picking just a couple things and not overindulging was quite difficult. My traveling companion and I eventually decided to shared the bruschetta and gnocchi, which were both very close to divine perfection in my mind - each was made with fresh ingredients and just popped with flavor from the vegetables, starches and seasonings with each bite. I honestly have no words for how wonderful that meal was. Truly excellent in its simplicity.

I admit the fact that I'd been driving all day and was starving could have clouded my judgment, but either way, Joe Badali's was just what I needed when I went there, with perfect service on behalf of a very kind and considerate staff. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"An old affordable standby for Italian food, Joe Badali's has long been on our \"go to\" list of great places to eat. Joe's expansive, impressive menu always has appeal (& surprises!) for me. The staff is friendly and attentive, and the restaurant's great location (so near Union Station, the CBC, CN Tour/Ripley's Aquarium/Roger's Skydome), make it for us a natural choice when hosting out-of-towners."}
{"text":"We were there last night before the 1d concert. The staff is great. Food was good.  We had the fried calamari (great portions btw). Trout and veal parm.  Nice place to eat...A little pricey but that goes with the area. Definitely go again!"}
{"text":"To summarize what i am going to say below: don't waste your money eating here.  The entrees were terrible...... 

I was excited to try this place as it looks nice from the outside and the menu sounded pretty good.  To start, the hostesses were rude and barely acknowledged us. The restaurant is a good size with several rooms to dine in; there was a large, very loud function going on in the bar area, so when the hostess tried to seat us in the casual dining section adjacent to the very noisy bar area, I didn't think it would be a big deal to ask to be seated in the section towards the back. Apparently it was. The hostess seating us was so rude about it but finally gave us a table (where there were several other diners.... We were not asking to be seated in an empty room). No one came around to get a drink order for nearly 15 minutes. We were nearly ready to leave and should have. When we finally got our meals, they were both terrible. The Caesar salad had very little dressing and the pasta and spinach dish I ordered was so garlicy (and I love garlic) that it was almost inedible. The other dish ordered was the cheese tortellini which was so stringy and cheesy and extremely bland and disappointing. I didn't have high hopes for dessert but wanted something (anything) to get the flavor of my dinner out. I ordered the dessert special, which was something hazelnut and that was surprisingly delicious. It was so good we almost wanted to get another. Once the waitress came over, she was friendly and other waitstaff repeatedly came over after that to check up. 

Except for the dessert and the friendly waitstaff (with the exception of the rude hostesses) it was a pretty disappointing meal and restauraunt in my opinion."}
{"text":"Hold on to your forks. It's going to be a bumpy service. After having been sat by a very nice woman, we had a different waiter come to our table and argue with her. He was fighting over our table, and apparently he won. Which is too bad because he was the worst waiter. After regaling us with tales of behind-the-scenes waiter and management intrigue, he tried to get us to change our appetizer order and then proceeded to disappear for the majority of the meal. Food was boring and rote Italian family fare. Finally got a glass of wine halfway through my meal. Other customers seemed to have the same problems we did. One couple showed up and sat for 15 minutes with menus. After no one came to take their order, they got up and left. Wish that had been us."}
{"text":"Mother and went while visiting family in Toronto. It had been a long night and we were ready for some nice Italian food. The Saturday night we went was busy to say the least and the crowds were nothing short of annoying, but they quickly got us to our table before anything got to bad. 

We were served my soup and my mother's salad, along with vinegar // oil and bread -  which, wasn't replenished once after that. Fairly soon after we had gotten our soups // salads our dinners came out...like weirdly soon. I had gotten the chicken Parmesan and my mother got the spaghetti. Now, I'm no chef but I'm pretty sure that chicken parm isn't supposed to be soggy...or green. The breading that was on my chicken was so mushy that I could run my fork down the side and it would just run through the prongs of the fork. It was also green, there must had been flakes of parsley in the batter that they coated it in and it must had dyed the chicken and breading. As for the taste, the consistency just completely ruined the taste for me. The pasta it was served with was pretty good, and the raw veggies could be more seasoned. My mothers spaghetti was pretty good, but for an Italian resteraunt? Ehhhh.....

Another few things that I just wanted to mention before this turns into a book, the glasses we were given were just a little bigger than shot glasses and almost every 5 minuets we had to ask for more water (Maybe this is a Canada thing???). The waitress was very nice and other than the food coming out so fast, we didn't feel rushed - even thought she had many other tables. Oh and what ever you do don't say yes to the shredded Parmesan, the guy made a MESS doing it. 

All together, it was a nice place to look at - really really hot in there but nice. Would've been 3 stars but the chicken just was so gross - and I'm not a picky eater."}
{"text":"Good food, attentive (without being overbearing) service, nice atmosphere, & good value for money. I have been to Badaldi's twice and both trips were great! 

The first time I was with a group of friends and one member of the group had ordered a dish with a lot of mushrooms in it and ended up picking a few out. The waiter noticed that she was pushing the mushrooms aside and asked if they could bring her something else. She politely refused as the dish was otherwise fine. When the bill came they gave her a discount because they were worried she was not satisfied. We were all surprised and impressed as she did not complain nor ask for a discount. This simple gesture spoke to how much the restaurant cares about the satisfaction of their customers. 

The second time I returned bringing two different friends. They both loved the dinner and have returned again separately since. 

I would definitely recommend Badaldi's and look forward to returning again myself in the near future!"}
{"text":"The pasta was being made right near where we were sitting and all 3 of our pasta dishes were fantastic.  The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to Badali's while visiting Toronto. I love good calamari. They had both grilled calamari and fried on appetizer selection. You can tell right away that they want their patrons to enjoy themselves. I loved the front of menu. The food was full of great flavors. Alberto was an awesome waiter with a great smile and sense of humor. He comped us a couple after desert drinks just to be friendly. If you want the kitchen to do a substitute of something like a type of pasta it was no problem. I have to say we made the right choice here."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible service I ever had! I went to this restaurant on friday night and our table was basically left out. Waited more than 40 minutes for the food and I started noticing other table were getting their food before our table even though they came in much later than us! So I asked the waiter what is going on and he was clueless, busy making excuses and blaming on the kitchen staff instead of an appology. He also suggested us to cancel the order,  he was basically asking us to leave. I was very disgusted by the service and unprofessionalism. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS RESTAURANT AND AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday. The place is huge and fantastic decor. Seems casual, but still got a nice touch. I ordered the veg wrap and fries and the other guest ordered a BLT fries. The wait staff were prompt and courteous. They bought the bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar quickly. Everything was up to the mark.

The fries for both of us were too well done for me and the quantity seemed a little too less. The food was good.

Will definitely go back and try the summer menu. Fair number of vegetarian options available"}
{"text":"Lots of gluten free options!! I went with the pasta carbonara & it was fantastic!! My son opted for kid's skirt steak & also loved it.  Excellent service!! Really nice spot!"}
{"text":"Joe Badali's is one of my parent's favourite restaurants in the city, and we go just about every time they're in town. The food is fresh, and delicious, and the prices are reasonable. The service is good, and the restaurant is absolutely huge, much bigger than you might expect. It's maybe not the trendiest place in the city, but their spaghetti and meatballs are outstanding, and I always look forward to a visit."}
{"text":"The app (salad) was basic - not bad but nothing outstanding.  Presentation could have been better for the Caesar (which my friend got).  The main was okay, I little bland but not horrible.  The dessert was actually really, really good.  Best part of the meal.  The biggest complaint though was HOW HOT IT WAS in the restaurant!!  It was actually extremely uncomfortable, and took away from our experience because we just wanted to get out of there and get some cool air!  The management told us it was out of their control as it was the building, but I can't believe there's nothing they can do about this.  He was sweating while telling us!  The poor waiters were dying!"}
{"text":"The most attractive feature about this restaurant is that it is located very close to Union Station so it was the most convenient place to meet up with someone before we had to get our respective trains.  I had the lobster stuffed pasta - it was good but quite salty.  The portion was on the small side.  Also tried the passionfruit lemonade which was sickly sweet.  Not horrible but also not a place I would necessary make an effort to return to anytime soon."}
{"text":"Joe Badali is 1 of the better restaurants in the downtown core. I was here years ago when they still have the lunch buffet bar. That being said, it is better to not binge eat during lunch hours. 

Venue wise, it hasn't change too much. Layout is still the same as they were before: quite clean and well lit plus good environment to have conversations. 

Food wise, I ordered their lunch special gnocchi in a cream sauce with chicken. And my coworker ordered a sandwich. Taste is okay. But price was a bit steep for lunch. 

Staff was great. They all have strong service attitude and that's what really makes a difference for returning customers."}
{"text":"The food was simply spectacular. Place and service were great. Recommend the  mussels - just 11 dollars got us like 40 mussels with an amazing sauce. Also had spaghetti with veal meatballs - perfectly cooked with very good sauce and perfect meatballs. Amazing experience
I wish the pasta was home made - other than that amazing restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but it seems that they forget to do the traditional things like serve bread.  Has everyone gone mad in cutting costs?"}
{"text":"The worst experience you can have. We were a party of twenty. Most of us didn't finished our dishes. I had a veal parmigiana escalope, it was just horrible : overcooked, too salty, fatty... The last time I ate so badly was in Poland eight years ago... I let you imagine."}
{"text":"I always wanted to eat here but never got around too it till I was driving around with a friend looking for a new Italian place. 

I'm glad I did! Came here around 3pm before the lunch hour -blue jays fans- rush. We pretty much had the whole dining room to ourselves. The restaurant is pretty huge, you can't tell too much from the outside because of the exterior. 

Lunch Menu: 

Crab cakes - $6 per piece 
house made crab cake, pineapple salsa, chipotle aioli ( I enjoy the per piece because you can choose exactly how many you want, we got 5) 

Midsummer Salad with Salmon - $16
heritage lettuce blend, fresh avocado, roma tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, grilled 4 oz. salmon, lemon thyme dressing 

Brasato Di Manzo Gnocchi - $23
rosemary potato gnocchi, 48 hour braised and pulled short rib, roasted mushrooms, Spanish onion, truffle oil, parmegiano reggiano cheese

The food was amazing, entrée portions were huge, so much deliciousness going on, I wish I was more hungry so that I could've eaten more :("}
{"text":"Everyone is essentially correct about this place.

The location, venue and service are great, no complaints there.

I had the Calamari Friiti as an appetizer, it was very enjoyable.

The entrees however... well it leaves a LOT to be desired.  Don't come here looking for gourmet Italian food, it is quite mediocre.  I went in a large group and there were several orders around the table.  

The Carbonara was tasteless, which is quite impressive considering the amount of bacon and cheese in it.  

The Penne Pollo Aglio Olio had absolutely no salt or garlic.

The Linguine Alfredo is a plate of pasta in a bland cream sauce...that's it.  No garnish, nothing and its $15....really?

The best part of the evening?  When several of us became violently ill and had to \"vent\" the overpriced food from our bodies.

Be warned."}
{"text":"Ravioli tasted bad and cold. Server sounded like she hated her job. Portions were extremely small considering the price is quite high and the quality of food was not that good. Will not return."}
{"text":"Yelpsters are high on crack to rate Badali's anything lower than 5 stars. Crazy. You guys are out of your minds. Come and eat in some of the US restaurants and tell me how Badali's compares .... you'll be trying to break Badali's doors down from the Rogers Centre. 

This place is awesome and it always has been. I remember eating here in 2006, 2007, and again 2011. The taste, customer service, and atmosphere is awesome. Bathrooms are spotless and clean.

The caprese salad is diesel. Wait, no ... I'll take that back, it's fucking way diesel. Awesome $hit. Plenty of flavor ... almost like 14 Victoria Beckhams having sex with you at once. The pizza is above and beyond. I ordered plain. My god ... what a pie. The pie tastes exactly the same as it did back in 2006. How many restaurants can we say the same for? If the caprese salad was 14 victoria beckhams, the pizza is 27 victoria beckhams. 

The place is the shit. No way on God's green earth does it deserve an overall 3 star selection ... you guys are crazy. A great place to come to after seeing the Blue Jays kick ass."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had dinner here as part of a tour group.  We were extremely pleased with our meals.  Excellent salads, main courses, wine, deserts and coffee.   Also very good service. We highly recommend this restaurant.  Check them out when in Toronto."}
{"text":"We had reservations here with the family after a Jay's game. 
Staff was very welcoming and and wait staff we exceptional. Atmosphere was very good. 
Ordered the penne Aribiata. Was good but very small portion for the price."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night with my boyfriend. He made reservations and when we arrived we were sat right away at a corner table (LOVED the table). 

The food...was at most...okay. The bread they had initially started us off with was extremely dry. The only edible part of the bread was the small amount in the middle. left 3/4 of it at the table. This was free...so i can't really complain. 

We started off with the fried calamari. It was definitely not the best i've had. It just didn't taste good, we didn't finish it. We always start with calamari when we dine, so we've had our fair share of it. I read somewhere their garlic bread was good....I would've probably ordered that instead if given the chance.

My boyfriend ordered a chicken salad, I had their squash ravioli. He loved his salad....but its salad, its pretty difficult to mess up. My entree on the other hand was bland, i added pepper and salt, still bland. I took a couple of bites then packed it up to go and recooked it when I got home. I couldn't let it go to waste. 

Our server was good. I forget his name but he managed to take care of all the tables he had at his section efficiently. 

A couple other downsides. I had asked him to surprise me with a drink...as long as it had pineapple juice in it, I was game. It came to me tasting like a virgin. I asked my boyfriend to try it to see if he could taste the alcohol and he couldn't....I would like to taste, even just a hint, for a $9.00 drink. 
Second, the guy who had come around clearing our tables had wiped the table with his hands. I know a rag and his hands probably carry the same amount of germs. It was just weird having his hands swipe the table. 
I am a dessert gal....My fave part of any dinner is the dessert. Out of the 5...MAYBE 6 options on their menu...the tiramisu was the only one that sounded good, but I didn't get it...stuck with an espresso (i didn't see any cheesecake, chocolate cake, apple crumble..SOMETHING)

That's about it. I was very hesitant coming, especially after reading the reviews on here (not very promising). But the guy just wanted to give it a try, at least now we know."}
{"text":"end of the year work function, Joe Badali's was the venue.
the place is quaint, filled with european decor finishing. The location is conveniently accessible via GO and TTC.
the service was fast, efficient and most of all friendly.
Based on a fix menu,
for starters I had their salad, and Butternut squash puree soup, just lovely, perfect balance of freshness, thickness, texture, you name it! and most of all it wasnt overly sweet. 4/5
Entree was their lamb shank on a bed of mash potatoes and veggies, perfect cooked, fall off the bone delight!!! 4/5
Cheesecake was about a 4.5 perfect portion, and not too sweet. 

Overall this place is a 4, and it was a nice work function food experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. Joe Badali's was chosen because it's one of the few places downtown that could accommodate a large group (20~). We were given a nice,  sectioned off area in the back of the restaurant.

The decor is rustic and very Italian. As we dined, we were surrounded by exposed bricks, paintings of giant garlic and a statue of a lady holding grapes. It still felt cozy and intimate despite our large group.

To start off, we got mama cucina to share between 4 people. Chose the grilled octopus, arancini (risotto rice balls), polpette ( meatballs). It was presented nicely in a tiered towered. The grilled calamari was cooked perfectly but the tomatoes that came with it was very very vinegary. The aracini balls were huge and had nice with a crispy exterior and soft inside but the polpette was lacklustre. The meatballs are comparable to what you get frozen at supermarkets. 

For the main, I shared the Chorizo Pomodoro Zucca. The name sounds a lot tastier than it actually was. It was a pizza topped with chorizo sausage, pumpkin, grape tomato and cheese. 
Didn't enjoy the pairing of the ingredients. I wouldn't get pumpkin on my pizza again. The cheese was rubbery and resembled bingo markers. It was far from the melty type that's stringy when pulled apart (the #1 thing that makes pizza great).

Joe Badali is great for accommodating large groups but the food very mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Excellent food, spectacular service, great ambience, all around a great experience."}
{"text":"1. Bland 2. Unsanitary 3. Poor service 
Came here for winterlicious on the first day; we were a party of two.  I requested if we could place our dessert order last (but order the appetizer and entree first). Instead of making an exception since I had asked, the server said no, made an excuse that he had a party of 30 so he wanted to be prepared (that has nothing to do with us...) I participate in winterlicious and summerlicious each time it takes place, never have I been turned down this request. This restaurant was not even busy. The waiter was just lazy or didn't want to accommodate. When our bread came, it was served by another man. The bread fell off the plate and onto his serving tray. He quickly picked up the bread with his hands and put it back on the plate thinking that neither of us would see!!!! Disgusting. The entree was VERY bland. The pasta was not cooked and very very dry. The pesto sauce was clearly just piled on top after trying to cook the pasta in water quickly. The cod was over cooked and dry. The quality of food is poor, like it was someone's first time cooking at home. Finally, when I asked for the bill, he had already prepared it for us, not giving us the opportunity for my coworker and I to ask for separate bills. We were forced to pay together. The waiter should have asked or given us that option at the very least. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Great service. Mushroom salad was yummy but the octopus was very small portion for that price point."}
{"text":"Go while you still can! We were looking for dinner before #towebfest when I spotted the gluten-free pasta on their menu. It's corn-based, and it's texture was great. The arrabiata sauce was just the right amount of spicy. I gambled on the local Cab-Shiraz on tap. It was a little much by itself, but perfect with the spiciness of the arrabiata. My husband found the gnocchi just right. I'm not really eating dessert much these days, but we split a gelato / sorbet trio: Tahitian vanilla, double pistachio, and blood orange. Scrumptious! The blood orange sorbet was just a bit grainy; other than that, the meal was perfect. It's really sad that this place is going away to make room for yet more condos."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a recent first time visit to Toronto and we had a great experience. The table shared arancini (good) and fried calamari (very good- breading was light and seasoned well and didn't fall off),  my star was surprisingly my pre-meal cocktail the cinque viva margarita- easily one of my top five best margaritas! I found the Spaghetti Carbonara to be delicious although a little heavy on the bacon grease. I was overall happy with the meal and the service was very attentive and accommodating. I would definitely go back for that margarita and fried calamari if nothing else!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and was actually surprised as we were ready to sit down to a fairly average meal given we had no expectations blindly walking into the place.  Service was great and decor/atmosphere was nice.
Very convenient as we were going to the ACC right after.
Though I would probably come downtown just to come here to eat."}
{"text":"Nothing special but nothing bad about this place. Atmosphere is good but food is average. Service is average. Drink menu is pretty good. This place gets very busy before a game so try coming when there isnt a jays raps or leafs game. Dont put at the top of your list for places to visit, but do not be afraid to give it a try."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends before the Lady Gaga concert.  The restaurant is huge, so it was one of very few that had reservations open near the ACC when I was making the reservation the night before the concert.  I arrived with one friend and told them I had a reservation.  They sat us in the back dining area, which was much quieter than the front of the house which had a large bar and a lot of people there for after work drinks, so it's very noisy.  

$60 + tip for a salad, pasta and a drink.  Not a bad price....if the food had any flavour.  The caprese salad literally tasted like nothing.  I don't know how else to describe it.  It was so bland.  The rigatoni bolognese wasn't too bad.  You get a decent size portion, and I was certainly full after my meal.  For the price I would have hoped for homemade pasta, which this definitely wasn't.  White sangria was okay.  It tasted more like juice than a wine drink.  

Although I wouldn't choose to come here for a nice date, this place serves a purpose: it's great for tourists, it's great for large groups, it's nearby union and the ACC if you're checking out a show, and takes reservations.  Because it's a tourist trap, it's definitely overpriced IMO, but if I wanted to make a reso to have dinner before another event at the ACC I would consider coming here again."}
{"text":"I went here for a private party and we had the back room to ourselves. I started off with a glass of the pinot grigio that the waitress recommended. It was very smooth! I also had a bite of the bruschetta and that was excellent. We ordered off a special menu (3 course) and I had the caesar salad, then the salmon with veggies and roasted potatoes. The salad was just ok. The potatoes and veggies were ordinary but the salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly. I'm always afraid of overcooked salmon but that was not the case. However, I do wish there was some type of sauce for the salmon because the veggies and potatoes were rather plain. I tried some of my friend's dish (gnocci with chorizo and eggplant) and I liked it too. The vodka like pasta sauce was tasty. Onto dessert! I have no idea how I even made it to dessert after eating so much already! We had cheesecake and it was decadent with a fresh graham crust, although I was only able to polish off half. The cheesecake had a citrus like taste to it which was rather interesting. Overall, I was pleased with my food and service. The bathrooms were clean too which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Excellent service and atmosphere. The ravioli was the best my wife has ever had, and she has had ravioli on three continents. She raved about it all the way home. Not being a rav guy I have to say I was also impressed. The pasta was cooked al dente and wasn't soggy or hard in any one spot. The Squash filling was wonderful

We came over after a trip to the 2011 Car Show. we were seated quickly and the service was fast and polite, but relaxed, with three gentlemen taking care of us. The place was quiet with about 8 other tables occupied.

I had the Blue Cheese and Streak salad and was impressed, both with the daring amount of some REALLY stinky (this is good) cheese, and the steak which was cooked perfectly as I had requested it.  Portion size was appropriate for the salad.

The layout of the place makes me think it will be very loud with a full house, but we are definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"In and amongst all of the restaurants found on the patch of Front Street you'll find Joe Badali's, a large-scale Italian place that I'm sure would be great for your parents and friends to meet up at and have a meal and a drink.  That is I'm sure if your parents and friends aren't Italian.

I have no problem with the food or the restaurant.  You sit at tables in large salons with staff bringing in whatever it is you need/want.  The place is clean and comfortable, but tends to get noisy once the place fills.  All of the wait-staff have nametags which dictate which of the Badali family they are, such as \"Emily\", \"Mordechai\", and \"Mohammed\".  You know, the typical Italian names.

Perhaps I'm being harsh, but it's sad that this place serving \"Italian\" is here and a mere six minute's drive gets you to Little Italy where the great restaurants are."}
{"text":"I tried the carbonara and it was amazing! 
The atmosphere was great and the location is convenient
 (located right by Union station). Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"this place reminds of of a nicer Olive Garden.  Food is ok, expansive menu.  Busy at lunch and dinner probably more to do with its location close to arenas and hotels."}
{"text":"Situated in the Financial District, Badali's was suprisingly empty Friday evening. My parents and I were worried that we hadn't made reservations but it was not at all a problem. The interior of the restaurant has a classical style with warm tones - very welcoming. 

I ordered the following from the $28 summerlicious dinner menu:
1 | Sundried Tomato, Mozzarella and Pesto Arancina (V)
A hand rolled, sundried tomato and nut free pesto mozzarella fritter, lemon mint aioli
2 | Pasta Di Pesce Spada
Tagliatelle pasta, flaked grilled swordfish, preserved lemon, pan fried house olives, anchovy oil, charred leeks 
3 | Chocolate Delice Coconut Bar
Salted caramel

The appetizer tasted spectacular. It was small in size, but full of flavours. The rest of the meal, however, was quite heavy, and I couldn't finish the pasta or dessert. The pasta didn't look very appealing, but it tasted decent. The caramel in the dessert was much too sweet, but the bar was well made. 

Service was great here. Our waters were refilled frequently, and the server was kind in offering recommendations. It was a good dinner experience overall."}
{"text":"Service is nice. Ambiance is enjoyable Italian bar/restaurant. Food could of been better. It's not testable, just mediocre... Portions are generous from appetizers to mains. Expected more Italian flair in food."}
{"text":"If you're starving and just need to eat, walk over 10 steps and go to jack astors instead - you'll be disatisfied eating here.

If you want italian food, take a cab to Terroni's.  About the same price, and a gazillion times better.

To be fair, the pizza was reasonably good.  As in comparable to panago or pizza pizza.  The gnocchi was atrocious - tastes like supermarket packaged gnocchi that's been on clearance.

The waitress was pleasant and kind, however she didn't bring us bread or refilled my glass.  I'm giving this restaurant a 1* for her good personality - nothing else.

If you're starving, a microwave and michelina's might be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner on a Friday night around 5:45 pm.

AMBIANCE/SERVICE
Deceivingly large venue. We walked for ages until we got to our table. Dimly lit restaurant with old fashioned tables and chairs. Kind of reminded me of the inside of a East Side Mario's, but less tacky and a little cleaner. Could probably seat 80-100 guests no problem.

Service was good - our waitress and the manager came around a couple times to ask how we were doing. Water was topped off almost as soon as the glass was less than half full. No complaints. 

FOOD
For the starter, I ordered the HOUSE-MADE DUCK PROSCUITTO ARANCINA. Golf-ball sized risotto held together by cheese and fried coating. The risotto was well cooked and seasoned but I felt it was over-fried and I couldn't really taste the duck proscuitto. 

I ordered the CHICKEN & SAGE RAVIOLI for the main, which I was very happy with. Large shavings of parmesan in the creamy sauce helped enhance the fragrance of the ravioli dish. Well seasoned, tender pasta but a rather small portion size. I wasn't really hungry but I still managed to finish all three courses.

For dessert, I chose the CHOCOLATE PANNA COTTA. Interesting use of spicy chocolate sauce to top off the chocolate panna cotta. I do have to complain the portion was pitifully small and the panna cotta a little thicker than I'd like (hockey puck-sized, but less than a centimeter deep). I finished it in like 3 bites. 

VALUE
For $28, you're getting a three course meal to try a little of everything. Portion sizes are questionably smaller than expected. Hungry diners will want to order more food. 

OVERALL
3 stars. Great service, okay food. Slightly higher prices than I'm willing to pay for the quality. Will I return? Maybe if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We stopped at Joe's after a movie the other night.

Joe's is along Front Street and it was the night of a hockey game, so game jerseys were in high evidence amongst the other diners. Obviously a good spot to have a bite before the game (not the least of which is it's proximity to the Air Canada centre)!

My hubby had the Bisteck and I had the Chicken Parmigiana.  We started with the Grilled Calamari.

The mains come with a choice of soup or salad (house or Caesar).  We both had the butternut squash soup (highly recommend).  

Also they bring you warm ciabatta bread with olive oil and balsamic (this is sooo good, you have to watch not to eat too much!)

The calamari comes with capers, olives, chopped tomatoes and olive oil.  Melts in your mouth.  This is definitely a large enough appetizer to share between two or three!

Both mains were very good and Joe's is pretty consistent.
The service was timely, even though it was quite busy."}
{"text":"Joe Badali's had excellent service on my visit. I will remember not having anything to complain about and not much else. 
The food was passable but not fantastic. The service was attentive but I wouldn't describe it as charming. Overall, Badali's will be a backup restaurant for me if I can't find anything better."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for the lunch buffet. Don't bother with that, seriously.

I honestly don't even know how you can even try to pass off that pathetic spread of food as a buffet. There were like 3-4 salad options, even less pasta options, and then turkey. There were a few thin crust pizzas available as well, which was perhaps the only redeeming quality of the buffet.

Really? How can you even call that a buffet in this day and age? No lasagna, no dessert, no soup, nothing. Lame, really.

Service was friendly and attentive, but the buffet really sucked."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner. This place is very large but was not busy on this particular night.

What I liked:
- gluten free options
- food was delicious and portions were just right
- steaks were prepared to the right temperature and cooked to the right tenderness (our table ordered steaks ranging from raw to medium rare)
- service was prompt and courteous
- it wasn't noisy and the atmosphere was great"}
{"text":"I organized a team lunch for 12 at this restaurant for winterlicious. The person on the phone when I made reservations was really friendly and flexible. I told them we might end up having plus/ minus 1 or 2 people and she said no problem at all. They also emailed me a coupon for free bruschetta. We arrived and got seated immediately. The decor of the restaurant was very nice. They gave us 3 platters of bruschetta for the table to share from the coupon, which tasted amazing! I ordered the butternut squash soup, salmon and cheesecake. The soup was perfectly flavoured and had amazing texture. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was bedded on spinach and tomatoes. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I would definitely come back to this restaurant. The whole experience was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here before Shania concert June 24 , had some calamari, two different soups and two different pizzas. All the food was very tasty and portions where very big. If you need a place to eat before a show or event at the ACC or Rogers Centre I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"In short: Great atmosphere & location, decent food and service, I would recommend and come again.

I came here for Winterlicious 2017 with a friend on a Friday night. I was surprised by the size of this restaurant in such a prime location. The decor is old school with interesting Italian details, the atmosphere was great!

After our order was taken, we received some bread, olive oil and vinegar. I wasn't a fan as the bread was cold. 

I order the duck prosciutto arancina with fig sauce. It was delicious, the rice was creamy and the fillings were evenly distributed so there is a good mix flavour and textures in every bite. The fig sauce seemed a little off at first compared to the conventional stuff you've tried. It had a paste like consistency but worked nicely with the arancina.
For my main, I chose the veal shank over saffron risotto. (Not very smart on my part, since the risotto tasted too similar to the arancina filling!) The veal was melt in your mouth tender, but I would have preferred a little more seasoning. Risotto was great too, the consistency was spot on. Otherwise it wasn't really that memorable. I did really appreciate when they offer your parmesan for your main, they use a real slab of cheese!
For my dessert, I got the bread pudding, it was tasty, nothing too special.

As a whole, I enjoyed this restaurant and given their selection and reasonable prices on the everyday menu, I would love to try again!"}
{"text":"For the price, the food is not all that great. Even the atmosphere isn't that impressive for a place that looks like they are aiming for fancy. Certain strong flavors seem to over power other bland ones in the dishes we had."}
{"text":"Before Gord and I went to the Toronto Rock game this evening, we had supper at Joe Badali's.

Joe Badali's is the official pre- and post-game venue for the Rock (you get 15% off your food).

Gord ordered the Classic New York pizza ... he said it was good.

I ordered a pepperoni pizza ... it was delicious and I ate it all!.

Laura was our server and she took good care of us."}
{"text":"Handmade pasta is the specialty here, and I love their Bolognese. Spacious dining area with a so-so wine list - needs more Italian representation!"}
{"text":"Given the special occasion of a rare family get together, I tried focus on the positives tonight. However, I have to say that I'm very regretful for having chosen to dine here. 

While it was easy to reserve a table for seven, and while there was good service, the limited/non-varied food selection, the mistakes with the order filling, and the food itself were just not good enough. Nothing I experienced justified the cost ($200+). 

The ratings on the food are: 

Calamari- 3.5/5
Bruschetta- 1.5/5
Mussels- 3/5
Veggie pizza- 2/5 
Seafood Linguini- 3/5
Veggie soup - 3/5
Badali burger and fries - 3/5
Fish of the day: got, got the order wrong, told the waiter specifically at the very beginning of the night that we do not eat pork, and the fish came with a pork side. It took three waiters before they confirmed the order was wrong and that mystery meat was pork. We were able to cancel the order. But not after accidentally having some and effectively ruining at least one of our nights. 

Overall, 2.5/5. I would not recommend the restaurant, despite that it has a nice atmosphere and ok service."}
{"text":"I used to go here 'cause it was close to home. Service was bad food was equally as amusing as the service and the joint was not cheap for what you are getting. Go across the street to Jonny Burger!"}
{"text":"Excellent value for your money. Brucetta was delicious starter... followed by awesome enters..... Gnocchi... Pizza.... Yum!"}
{"text":"Less than average food for the buck. Staff have no enthusiasm.  Service less than average too.  Big meatball appetizer is actually three small meatballs, golf ball size, that don't fill up the small serving dish.  The meatballs were also smothered in what appears to be tomatoe sauce from a shipping container.  Shaved cheese for the meatballs  was instead grated soft cheese of some type.

The carbonara pasta was again what appeared to and tasted like some sauce from a container..  so enhanced one could not even taste the bacon/pancheta.  Wrap it up with a big bill and some indigestion.  Passsssssssss."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the brick chicken. It is extremely juicy and flavorful. 

Also it comes on a bed of veggies including Brussel sprouts, spinach and beans. I thought that they compliment the chicken nicely. 

There's quite a bit of seating available. 

Friendly service"}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 and after wondering around Lakeshore for about an hour (where we also parked) we started searching for a place to eat Downtown. The entrance gives you 3 options, an Irish pub, a steakhouse and this Italian restaurant. We couldn't decide which one to pick, so we just went in. We were absolutely famished.
There wasn't almost anyone inside (I'm guessing 3 tables were already taken) but this was expected, after all, it was UFC night at the Rogers Centre. 
The atmosphere was relaxed and very enjoyable which is perfect if you just want to talk and enjoy your meal. Only 2 of us opted for appetizers, my girlfriend chose the stuffed mushrooms and I had the steak salad. Both were very good, although nobody asked me how the steak on my salad should be cooked and I think I got it rare by default. Not a big complaint here as overall it was one of the best salads I've ever had. Lots and lots of blue cheese which was amazing. 
For the main course, everybody wanted pasta. Our friends chose the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, I had the Jambalaya and my girlfriend asked if they had anything with bacon. They promptly offered to make her a Carbonara, even though it wasn't on the menu. Everything was really good, my Jambalaya was the best I ever had. I have to say that the Carbonara really stole the spotlight, it was that good (unexpectedly good) which begs the question \"why isn't it on the menu?\". 
The only reason why this restaurant gets 4/5 is because the pasta portions are minimal. I've seen this in many Italian places, but really, why the huge bowl when the food barely covers the bottom? My advice, never go there hungry as you'll end up spending a lot to leave full. You will have to fill up on the bread, which is hardly the point of going to a restaurant. The bill for 4, including a beer, 2 cocktails and an ice tea, plus tip was 160. Which means that this place should get a 3 for $$$ and a 4 for $$."}
{"text":"Meh. Food was average. Service was acceptable. Staff was friendly. Served its purpose to provide fuel after long day of venturing through the city. There are plenty of more unique and flavorful spots around, but this place is serviceable in a pinch; choice of convenience."}
{"text":"Great big place for large groups, they have large tables and large booths. Food is good, nothing to wow about. Service was fantastic. The front entrance. Th front entrance is hard to find, no obvious signage on where to enter. Step up the front steps and then see \"badali bar\" on the left wall verifies you are going towards the right place. We shall return again."}
{"text":"This place is as \"mainstream\" and \"large format\" as they come.  It's very large and busy.  Don't expect haute cuisine.  But the food is OK.  The skirt steak dinner was good.  The  lamb shank was just OK. 

Unfortunately,  this place is a victim of its own success.  Because of the location, they get bombarded with after-game crowds.  This means that the service leaves something to be desired.  We were here with several kids, but the kitchen \"forgot\" to put in the kids meals.  The poor kids were starving before they saw food.  One kid did get his food rather quickly, but that just made the other kids salivate even more.  To make things worse, the kids meals cost $10-$14!  Those are whopping prices for kids meals.

Other requests that were made of the kitchen were simply not followed on.  The manager did apologize, and offered deserts on the house.  Too bad the deserts looked better than they tasted.  

At the end, the bill was inflated by 10% with additional fictitious charges (like extra charge for salads, that were included with the meal.)

P.S. When a game is on, don't bother trying to get a seat without reservations."}
{"text":"I used to come here all of the time for family celebrations. I always loved their pasta as a kid, but upon returning here as an adult, the food was just okay... I ended up coming back with my parents, boyfriend, brother and his girlfriend and none of us were impressed with our meals... And the grand finale of the evening was a cockroach walking across our booth seat! I certainly won't return!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had pizza and their calamari

Don't get the steak cus it looked really dry and too well done. 

The pizza is delish. Get the mushroom one. Their calamari is good too.

This is a place if I had no other restaurants to go to"}
{"text":"Wasnt a fan , slow, unenthusiastic service , Kind of a morbid and lack luster experience. Food came out fast but was good nothing amazing, over priced for what you get . I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Joe Badali has excellent service, cozy casual atmosphere and fantastic pizza!!  We've been here multiple times and love it, never disappointed.  Servers and managers alike both make sure your evening is the best it can be.  Highly recommended!!  Diavolo pizza is the tits"}
{"text":"Great food, lovely atmosphere and awesome service! Had an excellent server by the name of Kolo, who helped make the dinning experience one that I would be happy to recommend. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Took my family to badali's tonight for dinner on the last night of our vacation. We were very impressed with both the food and service provided. Martin and Bobbie doubled teamed us with excellent service. It was great seeing two servers who loved their jobs and were very friendly. I ordered the ribeye special with a side a spaghetti which was very well cooked. Others at the table had the flat iron steak and spaghetti. Everything was cooked to order. Great job. Finished the night off with a brownie dessert. Once again the meal, service and atmosphere were well worth the price paid.  $150 for 4."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. 

The hostess was very pleasant and showed us the location of he bathrooms on the way to our table which was super helpful. 

We waited quite a long time before placing out order which kind of turned us off. 

Our server, Laura, was pretty good. She was friendly and attentive. However she took a while to come back to our table to take our order so we ended up placing it with another sever who for most of our items wrong which was disappointing. 

The food was blah. We would not return here. The 2 good things was the wine and the calamari fritti. We also ordered the chicken ravioli which was horrible. It has minded chicken and does not taste fresh. It's also covered in sauce hoping you you don't taste the blandness."}
{"text":"Food was bland, under cooked and microwaved! I ordered the halibut risotto with broccoli. The risotto was crunchy it was so undercooked and you couldn't even cut the broccoli. The server apologized but it seemed like an every day occurrence so it was no big deal. They took my meal back and literally showed up 2-3 minutes later claiming they made me a fresh dish. What \"magic\" risotto cooks in 3 minutes?? The broccoli was the same pieces they had given me before. I only know this because it's was brown on one side both times they served it and it still wasn't cooked! It was piping hot so obviously microwaved!! I informed the server that the second dish was just as bland and undercooked as the first one and she swore the manager watched the kitchen cook it from scratch. I told her that was a lie because risotto doesn't cook in 3 minutes and it's the same pieces of broccoli. She didn't have an answer. The manager never came by the table and all he did was discount $5 from my cheque! I will never go back to this place. They obviously can not stand behind their food quality, since the manager couldn't even talk to me nor do they care to make you happy.  Be wary of this place. Quit disappointing."}
{"text":"Pizza is actually really good here. I've had much better but I was surprised at the quality of the dough and fresh toppings

We ordered Bruschetta, but were informed shortly after they couldn't make it as they ran out of Tomatoes. Found this odd for a \"Italian\" restaurant. This is comparable to McDonalds running out of French Fries. 

The calamari and Arancini (rice balls) were also good. The rice balls are quite expensive though at $4 a piece. Not worth it imo. Calamari was excessive though. Def worth the $14 price tag. 

Pasta sucked though. Severely over priced for the quality and quantity. I would certainly avoid ordering pasta here."}
{"text":"I would say that Badali's food will be great for $$, but so-so for the actual $$$. Portions are small and take time to arrive, even when the place is almost empty. Wine selection is uninteresting and overpriced.

Service is variable, and hugely depends on your attire. Drop in with a bunch of friends right after the office - all still \"uniformed\" - and those guys will bow and call you \"sir\". Walk in on the weekend with your girlfriend, dressed casual, and they will treat you as a \"hey dude\". Silly.

This is not an Italian restaurant per se, it just bears some design flavour to prove the point, but that's about it. The food is sort of based on something that is believed to be Italian, but has barely anything to do. Whole bunch of plates are over-spiced.

There is nothing especially wrong with Badali, just don't invite your Italian friend to proudly show him that Toronto has something he might find familiar - as he probably won't."}
