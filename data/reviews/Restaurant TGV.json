{"text":"Best place to eat with a group of friends or family, don't expect a quiet and intimate dinner. If you're a foody and love to share and taste to everything it's the perfect restaurant for you! The staff is friendly and simple type of environment. I do recommend this place, it's top notched!"}
{"text":"So me and my husband were driving back from Quebec City (back to Toronto) we took a wrong exit and ended up near the Biodome in Montreal and decided to find a place to eat before hopping back in the car and continuing our drive. We saw this Turkish place on Yelp and decided why not try it.   Me and my husband ordered the Adona plate (I got the salad he got the fries) my favorite thing on the plate was the burgul (you get a choice of burgul or rice), we both had better adona kebabs in Toronto (if you're ever up there try Anatolia the food there is made with pure love) the kebabs here were okay. The salad was literally taken out of a bag and slapped on to the plate and soaked with Italian dressing (Kraft Italian dressing in a Turkish restaurant? ) staff was friendly.   The place isn't the cleanest. They had the door open for air to come in (no AC just fans running) there were flies in the bathroom and flying around the food while we were eating. Overall, this place seemed like it had its regulars for the business to run."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Turkish restaurants but I must say this one is definitely one of my favorite! The service was good food was being served quickly restaurant was clean prices are very resonnable. I don't usually leave reviews but I had such a great time with my family today that I just had to!"}
