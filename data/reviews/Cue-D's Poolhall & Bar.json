{"text":"I would recommend coming here with a group of friends because you'll always have a great time. They have a giant juke box with a large selection of music from where you can pick from. I'll be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"They were terrible people with terrible things. All they did was treat women like hookers and hot dogs aren't actually sold there unless there is a slave in the kitchen. It's in China town so if you are not Asian they have no respect for you. Also the bathrooms are dirty. I spotted a few cockroaches on the walls and we found a dead on in the pocket. We left immediately because it smelled terribly like cigarettes. Also when we were trying to get out they refused to take our card unless we paid eight dollars. If I could I would have that place closed immediately."}
{"text":"Yooo Cue-D's is my spot love envionment, love the free iced water just such great service  its really chill  oh definitly a spot to spend your nights at"}
{"text":"My experience here was very poor I came 11/25/2016 around 9:00 pm. I came with a group of friends and when we walked in the manager/or owner(Asian man with black hair and a tattoo on his chest) was smoking behind the bar and drinking, which is not presentable at all. Then instead of greeting us with a \"good evening\" or \"how are you guys tonight,\" we were greeted with a \"what do you want.\" Ignoring the fact of the poor greeting we continued to go to our table. When we wanted to order a hotdog he stated \"really man\" then asked \"how many,\" then proceeded to say \"well you have to wait to order until 11:00 pm,\" I came to play pool at 9:00pm. I told him, \"why can't you make it, it is just one little hotdog,\" then he said \"well I do not have an employee and I do not want to go back there, so you can go next door to get a hotdog.\" Then I went back to the table and notified my group and my girlfriend said, \"why can't he make a hotdog himself, it would not be that long.\" Then she proceeded to ask him for a hotdog, asking politely because, again, it was a little, most likely frozen, hotdog. Then the manager began to get a little hostile with my girlfriend, so we decided to leave. Then began to confront us, practically yelling at us. Their is NO WAY I would come back to this place. The manager/or owner was very disrespectful to us and did not deliver any good or even ok customer service. The hotdog was not the big deal, but how he handled and responded was terrible. It does not matter how the guest is acting, as a Manger/or owner it is your job to handle any situation correctly."}
{"text":"This is my go to billiard place. The employees are very nice and approachable. The pool tables, cues, and balls are in good shape and aren't badly damage. They provide a variety of music, which you can change with a small fee. The location is clean and doesn't have clutter everywhere."}
{"text":"Pool is fine. This is more a review about the hookah they offer. Because it was terrible. The apple tasted awful and the guy wasn't much help. He initially put too many coals and burnt it so it was super harsh. If you burn something maybe switch it out. Don't take one coal out and try and act like it doesn't taste like garbage. Maybe do anything to stop a customer from leaving upset enough to write an awesome yelp review about it. The girls were nice and one of them was super helpful. Avoid the hookah and it might be ok. Also try not sitting in the chairs, unless you enjoy slowly sliding out of them."}
{"text":"This is my home away from home!  The best spot in my opinion to just kick back after a long day and shoot some pool. It's reasonably priced so get get a great bang for your buck. The staff is AWESOME! I've come to know them all very well and feel like I'm a part of the family. They have a pretty cool little bar/sitting area for you to just hang out at if you're not feelin on your game. Overall I truly love coming here and recommend it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good Variety of music and good vibes. Service is wonderful and the workers are awesome. Pool tables available right away."}
{"text":"Cue D's is always my go to spot to hangout and have a good time. They never fail and goes above and beyond my standards. If you're into smoking hookah, this is also the spot to smoke. Hookah god/master Alan goes beyond expectations and makes phenomenal bowls. As for a person who's been smoking for awhile and always picky. He's never failed. The staff here is super humble and friendly. So if you're into playing pool and smoking hookah, this is def the place to be and I'll always be coming back !"}
{"text":"LOVE the new management! The new owner is so awesome and very understanding! He actually listened to what happened and apologized on behalf of them. He offered my family and I a free hour. The staff is great and i feel very welcomed. I can feel the new atmosphere and I'm excited to come here again! Thanks, Josh! You're awesome! :)"}
{"text":"Strangely friendly workers. Mostly bent-out-of-shape pool sticks. Cheap beers. Cheap hourly rates. Large spot. Younger kids and riff-raff. Noun phrases!"}
{"text":"Full Five Stars No that's not a mistake No i'm NOT THAT DRUNK Yes i got some sense  Five stars for having such a wide selection of beers for such a hole in the wall. There's very few places that carry both Blue Moon AND Shock Top, I cant even get these two at the Red Rock Sports Bar and that's such a classier place then this hole in the wall.  The men's room is a sight to behold. How the frak do you get tagging on the ceiling? i mean seriously ON THE CEILING!!   Cheap and wide selection of beers, Jukebox that plays some old school hip hop, cheap and wide selection of beers, cheap games of pool (either a dollar a game or you can pay by the hour don't know how much didnt ask), and the cheap and wide selection of beers.  Might see me here more often trying to recall what i learned from geometry.   Five stars if you're into this sort of thing if not then...three i guess you cant argue when cheap beer in long neck bottles."}
{"text":"Talk about throwing it back old school for me. I still remember oh about twenty years ago first moved too Vegas would frequent Shark Pool Hall with roommate go shot pool and drink after work. Times have changed with lot more pool halls across the valley. It was my first time coming too Cue-D. I really had no expectations expect keep my early yakudoshi party going night. It located in the perfect spot comes too finding some great asian food off the strip. After great night at Wendy decided too keep the party going across the street. The only downfall feel for all the shops in this little strip mall is parking suxs! It can fill up supa fast but if all else fails can park across the road then walk over.   Pool Hall its not Huge Huge but just overall nice size. Think something like over 15 tables in all. Not the full size regulation tables. Who need regulation really going there too drink and play pool with friends? Lol! Drinking about steal of deal. I believe from 7-10 running special two dollar beers. The catch was fact not your typical cheap flavorless ones they had few nice craft beers. Me and roommate went for the Shock Top. Really for $2 that is SHOCK of price no pun intended. The bar area itself is nothing too brag about just your basic hole in the wall feel for bar. The service is awesome. The moment walk in ask if playing pool, games or hour, many tables, and really on it. The tables for really looks like hole in wall place are really nice. The felt are nice all around or could tell on all the tables (no rips, clean, and tables are all leveled right). The house sticks most part straight not warped or abuse much being house  sticks. Each table nice table area you can place your drinks and whatever else bring, The jukebox something that cool surprise! You can play whatever music in the mood or rocking pool game on. I like the fact that the tables have nice amount of space between tables or feels like more then normal?  The only thing need too be prepared for is NO CASH. They do have ATM right next too the bar, We had too use because first timers had no clue.   Definitely fan of Cue-D. If ever have urge too go shot pool really this place rocks for bargain and love hole in the wall places in Vegas."}
{"text":"If your trying to find a good time to hang out with a couple of your buddies, I recommend this place. Sunday through Thursday girls get to play for free.So fellas if your trying to take your date out for some fun and low on budgets, I would bring them there. Service is great, prices are cheap and plus they even have beer pong tables so if you wanna challenge your friends or maybe your date to a couple of games or just wanna show them up in pool, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Love coming here. We go on the \"ladies free nights\", but it's usually pretty busy. Parking spots are few and far between if you come at night, since it's in the same plaze as restaurants and karaoke bars. The staff is extremely friendly, and will make you feel welcome. Their cue sticks are also in good condition (unlike Pool Sharks, which is a hit and miss). Fun place to chill at night."}
{"text":"This has become our go to place for me and my friends. The fact that they have lots of quality pool tables is really good. Service is great, Karin and Gaby are always nice and do great customer service. The place is clean and it gets busy real quick. I like the fact that you can bring your family and friends here eventhough they are underaged. Beers are cheap, and they also have a jukebox if you want to play your beats. Another interesting promo about this place is their happy hour. So it's $10 all day from 3pm-9pm. Who can beat that? With that being said, this is my favorite place to unwind (because playing pool is my hobby), and spend quality time with my peers. Thank you Cue-D's!"}
{"text":"Sure, this place is full of the younger crowd. But you don't have to feel too old here, as for all types of people are welcomed. Besides, when you're young, you're hip... & hip is good. Location isn't in such a great place either, but it seems to be a good location for most as I've seen people from all over Vegas go there.  It's also centered near a karaoke lounge & a hookah lounge. There are several Asian stores surrounding, as for it's near the streets of Chinatown.  The prices are pretty flexible, if you can't afford enough for a game itself, you can always use the quarter tables. If you go there enough, the staff is like to give you discount. There's also music you can choose yourself provided along with other stuff like an arcade, a bar, and a lounge area.  Overall, it's a pretty chill environment, and although it's not the greatest, it's a spot definitely to check out because it's one of the places in Vegas where almost anyone who's done pool has gone there."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Beer and pool, what more could you want? I don't like the indoor smoking part but hey, if you can at a bar why not inside I guess. The owners aren't really friendly. More like just help you and go. The games are cheap too! This is the place I go to now since Pool Sharks closed."}
{"text":"I first want to start off with saying... whoever made their playlist, it was a great choice of music.  This place was really cool because you get the option to do hookah and play or drink and play pool. The tables are on good shape. A comfortable chill place to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Pros: *Cheap - $5 per hour and on Sundays ladies are free *Lot of tables, so you shouldn't find yourself fighting over one *Beer and snacks *Arcade games *Wifi - It popped up on my Itouch, but there was a pass needed. I'm assuming you just have to ask and it'll be free for customers *Open late *Friendly staff *Decent amount of places to sit *Erotic video games at the counter! They have a small touch screen computer with a selection of Trivia, Puzzle, Erotic, Action games that are only 25 cents each. We scored 3rd place on erotic trivia, right under \"F*ckalicious.\"  Cons: *Seems like there are always a lot of teens *SO smoke filled. I felt like I was hot-boxed in a closet full of cigarettes and the stench would not go away, even after driving all the way home with all the windows down.  *Dirty bathrooms - I went in and there was toilet paper on the toilet and floor.  Even though there are only 3 things I don't like about this place, they are still pretty big for me, which is why I am giving them 3 stars. This place is just A-Ok for me. We always end up here when it's late and we can't think of anything to do."}
{"text":"I got invited to this pool hall with some friends and I really enjoyed my time here, the drinks aren't so pricey as other places, the prices on the pool table it self are right around other pool halls as in hourly, but what i enjoy the most is the staff, they are very friendly and always try to serve you as in the best way they can. I met josh and He's a great guy. I have made this place my Friday night with my buddies."}
{"text":"Been here twice, love the vibes, hookah is on point. Definitely coming back again. If there was any pool place to go I'd pick Cue D's."}
{"text":"Used to be my high school hangout. School, work then go straight to Cue D's. Repeat lol. Everyone and their mommas used to kick it here.   I haven't been there in a minute so I wouldn't be able to review it accurately but I know they have plenty of tables and they do get busy at times so their might be a wait to get a table. A few arcade games and a jukebox to entertain while you wait.   The only thing is the smoke. That can be bothersome but it's a pool hall. it comes with it. as long as you have good company and enjoying yourself..it's a relax chill place."}
{"text":"Back in my high school days this place was the hang out spot. Not sure how many countless hours I spent hear but this is pretty much where my friends and I always ended up. I remember they used to have a couple arcade games but they got rid of them, but they did clean up/renovate the inside a little. Located in Chinatown, Cue-D's is solid spot to shoot some balls but there are a couple downsides. Overall the place isn't bad but if its your first time here are a couple of things you should know going in.   Pros:  --Plenty of pool tables, all in good condition. --Specials on drinks and a weekend happy hour! -- Lots of restaurants/bars/karaoke spots in the same strip mall. -- Young crowd, most of the customers were probably under 30. (well its a pro for me cause thats my age group)   Cons:  --Super smokey environment - coming out your hair, clothes, everything will smell like cigarette smoke. --Cash only - don't accept credit card but there is a ATM that charges $2.50 to use. BOO! --Questionable music - there is a pay-by-song juke box and unfortunately last time I was some guys decided to troll the place and play William Hung's 'greatest' hits. =( --Super packed parking lot on busy days with alot of people who loiter around amongst the cars =\"}
{"text":"My favorite place to shoot pool at and that's very close to where I live! I've been coming here for over 6 years. Low hourly pricing, friendly staffs and they have quarter machines for you to select your own likings to music in there. Even if you don't own your own pool poles you'd be pretty lucky to find a couple around the place that is legit. You would know what I mean if you play enough when I say that.  Definitely coming back for every time I'm craving to play some pool !"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything you would expect from a pool hall Cue-D's delivers at an affordable price.  Plenty of full size pool tables with nice felt, decent cues that were not beat up too much, a nice Touch-Tunes jukebox (be sure to get the app for your phone!), and a bar at the entrance with beer specials ranging from $2 Shock Tops to bucket deals. Cash only, ATM at the entrance.   The decor reminds me of something from the '80s, but I only spent two years in that decade so maybe I am not the best choice of judge. The bathrooms weren't the cleanest in the world, but that is to be expected at a pool hall I suppose. Smoking is allowed in the hall, as it should be, but if my memory serves me correctly, the place is poorly ventilated and you can just feel its presence seeped into the carpet, walls, and ceiling over the years.  The bartender didn't seem too enthused to be there, but that was fine by me. Hand over the beers and let us hit the tables. One last thing about the jukebox! Anyone can play almost anything on it and their sound system is pretty good and loud throughout the joint. So you could have anything from Mark Tremonti belting out wicked face-melting guitar solos to bubbly synth-pop by Lights."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I really appreciate how the staff remembers me. It's a great spot for locals to hang out and there is a really great tea place right next to it. The jukebox is rear and you can connect your phone to it so you can use your debit card."}
{"text":"We had fun but this place is super overpriced. We were charged $48 for 3 hours of pool, though the rate wasn't posted anywhere. We spent a lot of money on drinks and hookah as well. We ordered double apple hookah, which tasted like strong black licorice, and they wouldn't let us get a new flavor. We put a ton of $ in the juke box as well but at the end of the night it was playing awful Spanish music for hours and out music mever came on, so we left. Next time we'll take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I felt a bit too old to be here in this place.  Always full of the younger crowd.  Neon lights fill the dark lit pool hall.  There's a VIP room in which you can rent for drinking, relaxing, and singing karaoke.  There's also arcades located in the corner of the room.  Prices are above decent.  I give it three stars because the place is nice and roomy so I won't knock on the place.  However, there just seems to be trouble with other customers there.  It's also not situated in the best part of Spring Mt."}
{"text":"Cheap prices $10 an hr for 2+ people. No liquor license yet. Will be back when I can buy beer! ;)"}
{"text":"Great local hangout.  All ages are allowed to shoot pool.  Place is kind of smoky at times but I always have great time with great peeps.  Staff is cool with bringing in food for big groups, as long as you clean up after yourself."}
{"text":"When I moved out here almost 3 years ago, the first place my bud wanted me to search for was a solid pool hall. Fellow Yelpers recommended this place and I immediately bookmarked it.  Fast forward to just week and I finally was able to uncheck this bookmark.   My Pool Hall \"Wish-List\" - So, what defines a good pool hall for me? -Full size billiard tables, not the bar type ones -Clean and fast felt.  I grew up playing on Simoniz felt, but anything where you can put action on the cue ball works just as good. -Plenty of tables -No sharks trying to hustle me. Ha! -Straight cues ranging from 18oz to 21oz.  I prefer a 19 oz for playing and a 21 oz for breaks.   -A good juke box playing good music. -Cheap, none of this $20 an hour stuff -Plenty of room -A pool hall that isn't intimidating -Smoke free (yeah right, especially in Las Vegas)  A group of us entered Cue-D's for a friendly game of pool and since there was an odd amount of us, we ended up playing a game of Cut Throat.  Cue-D's is chill and it doesn't matter if you're an A or even a D player, everyone is welcome. Cue-D's hit most of my \"Wish-List\", but most importantly I had a great time with fine people.   My only issue is the stench of smoke in the air.  I know, I know, this is something that they can't control since smoking is legal inside pool halls in the valley. I use to smoke and I get it. Now that I don't, I see the difference.  The smoke didn't bother me so much while I was playing, but the smell sure followed me home.  Cue-D's is welcoming from the staff to the patrons. I'm a fan of the pool hall, just not a fan of the smoke.   PS.  The rest rooms can use a little Mr. Clean or AJAX.    TIP:  Cash Only   YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (404/500)"}
{"text":"So I have gone to this establishment many times and it was very fun! but this time will be the last time. The music the whole night was shit and we decided to get the $25 hookah that they just added to there options to do. We all love hookah, so we definitely decided to get it but after getting the hookah to our table we soon found out that was the worst decision we could make. The hookah was just cheap and tasted like ash. When we asked to get our money back because what we got was NOT worth 25, they said they will not give our money back but instead give us a new bowl. But when we got the new bowl it was horrible as well!!! That wasn't even the worst part! I know the music the establishment can't control because it is off of a jute box but we put a total of 20 in this box staid for 2 hours and never heard one of our songs ! When we explained this to the manager all he could tell us \"it's a 3rd party and we can't do anything to help you\" over all I am over everything that happened tonight!! DO NOT GO TO THIS POOL HALL!!! I really wish I could give this 0 stars because it's not even worth 1 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Awful place too expensive shit service and all they played was Mexican music. We will never be back.  Don't waste time here unless you know Spanish."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent choice for a pool hall of las vegas. Benjamin, along with the rest of the staff, is very friendly and are quick to offer their service. They add to an excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"We like the new owner. The atmosphere is chill and they're working on their liquor license so it's going to be even better. Definitely recommend this place for some casual billiards, the rates are reasonable."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it zero stars. Terrible customer service and disrespectful. I was yelled at just for asking for a hot dog. It is advertised all over the place and when asked , I was given attitude. 10/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times. In fact, I only come here when my cousin invites me to hang out with her and her boyfriend. It's kind of his home away from home. As such, they know pretty much everyone there. So by proxy, I know everyone there. It's got that Cheers quality.  My most recent visit was last Friday. We didn't play any pool. We just hung around the bar area celebrating a friend's promotion. The bar area is a bit awkward in that the seating is kind of weird. They have these booth type things that look like they once had tables.  A note about the bar - they only take cash. Their prices are decent - $3 for domestic beers in a bottle - and they have a pretty good selection. I found myself enjoying a bottle of Shock Top poured into a glass at the suggestion of Henry, the bartender. He poured most of it into the glass, then put the bottle on its side, and rolled it back and forth before pouring the rest into the glass. I had never heard of this before, but after a Google search, it's apparently legit.  \"The beer is best enjoyed in a tall, wide-mouthed glass. To serve the brew perfectly, follow these pouring guidelines. Pour the brew down the side of the glass until about one-half inch of brew is left in the bottle. Lay the bottle on its side and roll it gently back and forth, mixing the remaining yeast that has settled at the bottom. Pour the rest of the brew, producing a nice, thick collar of foam.\"  Nice"}
{"text":"Great place to hangout with friends and play pool. Tables are $10 a hour and import beers are $4 a beer or $20 for a bucket. They have a jukebox playing music  loud which is cool in my opinion, might be a turn off for others. All of the cocktail waitress are hot and friendly. My only gripe with the place is that it get pretty hot inside, they have a few fans blowing sporadically throughout the play but if you're not near by one it can get uncomfortably hot. Also as a side note there is a lot of smoking going on inside so if that bothers you, you may not want to come here."}
{"text":"Friends and I wanted to do something fun late at night and this billiards is the place to be if you are on a cheap budget and need a spot to chill with friends.  There are plenty of pool tables and every time I'm here I rarely have to wait for a table to open. The young lady that serves us is always friendly when we walk in and if you order food and/or drinks she brings it to the table. I appreciate the great customer service.  The rates per hour are reasonable and does not break the wallet. They also serve soft drinks and alcohol. I believe the only food they serve are hotdogs but I'm not too sure because I only ordered food here once and I liked it.  This place also has fun arcade games. My friends really enjoy the punching bag game where you hit the bag as hard as you can and it gives you a score every time you punch it. We are always very competitive.   Overall this billiards is the place to be if you have nothing to do late at night with a bunch of friends just to hang out and have fun."}
{"text":"This is where we had my boyfriend's \"SEE YA LATER\" party.  The staff was willing to have food and as many people we wanted for the party.  It was an amazing event, it always is.    All I have to say is that Cue D's can be an addiction.  The people in this place make a difference and we already miss being here.  The staff is accommodating, warm, and friendly. It's very inexpensive and can have fun without spending an arm and a leg.  It is mostly young kids, so someone who is over 30 might not feel comfortable being here.  However, the most interesting person in here is the bartender who is like an uncle to my boyfriend.  When you come here often enough, it'll feel like home.  Just give it a try because you never know what kind of friendship you might make here."}
{"text":"The type of place where you chill with your bro friends have bro drinks together, and have a broment.   Or you can come here after you are finished eating at q bistros.   Place is located on spring mountain and jones, it'll be on your right; inside the infamous icy juicy plaza. Walking in the vibe of the place is very relax and trendy. Along with billiards they have some cheap beer and a jukebox that can play anything! Seriously that box has every genre from every time period.   One small thing that bugs me is how smokey and dirty the place is :/ But it's still a definitely a to go to place at night time."}
{"text":"For over 3 years, I have found myself constantly coming back to Cue D`s. To sum it up lightly.. this place has changed my life greatly. I wasn't always a pool player in the beginning, but Cue Ds is more than just a pool hall to me and to many people. It is like a home away from home for everyone who simply needs that escape from reality. On first impression of walking in, any customer will be greeted with a cheerful staff that knows your name and will care enough to say hi by your name. It doesnt take much to become a regular here,  just a few simple conversations with the workers at the bar and before you know it, you'll be drinking beer, watching movies, playing beer pong and of course, shooting pool with your new friends. There are people who I see go here every day just to hang out with the people that they meet at this pool hall. If youre a friendly person who simply wants good company, youve found the right place to be. Currently, Cue Ds has one of the best promotions in town. As a woman, pool is not an easy sport to try and dominate in. Not saying that Im good or anything (because Im not lol) but this place has given me and many girls out there the opportunity to practice pool for free. Monday through Thursdays from 6PM until 3AM, women get to play for free. YES. Free. Cue Ds has really given thought to the community and opened its doors to the females of Las Vegas. Women should really take advantage of this opportunity and go out there and shoot some pool!  Cue Ds has tables that are custom made to be specialized only to their name. You wont find anything else like it in Vegas. With tables that get clean every other day and re-felted monthly.. its really good for the pros and amateurs of all kind. At Cue Ds, they also have amazing drink specials that Ive become a big fan of. Their bucket specials are only 17 for 5 beers, something you wont find anywhere else.  If you ever have a party, their beers come with free beer pong also! They recently remodeled and now have weekly tournaments on Sundays and Wednesdays. Its only $5 to join, and you can even win up to 150 at a time. Its one of the cheapest tournaments in town. Overall, if you havent hung out here before.. youre missing out. Look at this place like a shelter or community boys and girls club. Theres more to it than just pool!"}
{"text":"The games of pool are super cheap and the jukebox is a cool touch. My only complaint is that the place reeks of cigarette smoke, because they allow the players to smoke inside. I wish there was an enclosed area for non smokers, so when you leave you don't reek of the place. :/"}
{"text":"Another week, another pool hall.  Located right across the street from Wendy's Noodle Cafe, we just walked over after Chad S.'s early birthday dinner to play some Cut Throat.  It's a good thing we did the stroll since the parking lot here is always packed with cars coming and going.    KUDOS:   -The juke box has Bob Marley! -There is a super friendly guy to greet you and they have happy hour specials for those who drink. -TVs were showing a football game, which just happened to be the b/f's team.  If you like sports and pool, this is the place for you!   GRIPES: -Smoky as all get out.  My eyes were watering after an hour.  I know this is to be expected in a pool hall, but it still stinks. -The women's bathroom could use a little sprucing up.  Again, it's a pool hall, but whatevs.  We had a fun time and it's a cool spot to hang out for an hour if you're dining or having dessert at one of the many establishments right in the plaza or across the street."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and our friends wanted a place to chill and hang out, and Cue D was the perfect spot! We got a table and played pool for about 2 and half hours, got some darts, and ordered some food while we were there. There's a jukebox that you can choose songs out of, but you have to pay. It was fun being able to pick songs you liked, and the price was about a dollar per song. You can also order food and drinks, and play a few video game machines that they offer. There's also this small little punching ball/bag looking thing that you can hit, and it'll tell you how hard you hit it. It's a really cool place, with a great environment if you don't mind cigarette's. The rates were pretty decent. We paid $10 an hour for the pool table, plus $5 for darts, but the rate for the table varies depending on the day/amount of people in your party, so look into it!   Now let's discuss the cons. While there, we found out we couldn't order food until 8 for whatever reason, but it was already 7:30 so we didn't really mind. We ordered at 8:20, but our food didn't come until 8:50, which we thought was a bit ridiculous for a box of wings and fries. We were actually suppose to get TWO boxes of fries, but we only ended up with one, so not only did our food take forever, but a part of it was missing. One of my friends went to ask about our food, and the girl's response was that she'd call to see where it was. Call who? We thought that the food was coming from the place directly, but I guess not. It was a bit sketchy, as I'd like to know where our food is coming from, ya know? The wings were $12 and the fries were $6, a bit pricey for food which was only mediocre at best. Although it is a bar and this is typical, the cigarette's fuming through the air was a bit of a turn off. It was a legit hot box but with cigarette's, and you end up smelling like it after, but eh, what can you do?  At the end, we paid $47, but an additional $8 (which we paid upfront) for two strawberrita's, so it was $55. There was 5 of us total, so not too shabby! Although the food part sucked a little, we will still return and genuinely enjoyed our time!  (Side note: If you are sick, you probably don't want to go here! My boyfriend had a mild cold and was coughing a lot because of the smoke. Just a little tip.)"}
{"text":"It is a great hang out spot!  It is basically how you would expect a pool bar to be. Be prepared to inhale a lot of secondhand smoke! It is expected since it is a bar.    There has never been a wait time for any tables here.  It's a huge place with plenty of tables!  The prices are reasonable! It's around $8-10 an hour per table. There are seats and tables around the table.  They have a happy hour for drinks but too bad I'm not 21 yet.   From my experience,  they don't seem to mind if you bring drinks and food from Icy Juicy next door, even though they have a \"no outside food or drinks\" sign on the front window. Just don't have it near the table.   The bathrooms is a surprise every time. Sometimes it is very clean, and sometimes it is very dirty. I guess you just have to be lucky.  There is nice music! Bring some cash for song requests on the jukebox!"}
{"text":"Pool sticks were straight, so that was good. Music choice was not enjoyable for everyone. They were out of Pizza and didn't tell us until after we ordered so that kind of sucked. The customer service was good from the guy with short black hair, not so much from everyone else. But they gave me a free strawberita for my birthday so that was really sweet. Overall the visit was ok, I just don't think the experience was worth the money. 15$ an hour for one table because we had one extra friend who didn't even play at all, so basically we had to pay for him to sit there. And $6 for a small serving of \"alright\" French fries."}
