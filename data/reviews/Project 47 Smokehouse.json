{"text":"Brisket sandwich was good, be sure to ask for a lean cut or it will be super fatty. The cornbread side for $1.47 was VERY overpriced. It was nothing more than a small cornbread muffin top. We got there as soon as they opened and there were 4 flies flying around our table, which was annoying and made it feel dirty. The bbq sauce tasted good, but again we were there first thing, and the bottles were greasy and had bbq sauce on the outside of them from the night before, the tops were dirty with old bbq sauce and one of them had the top cut off. There were crumbs in the seats still and the table was covered in streaks, like it had been wiped off with a dirty rag. Our server was timely and polite, but overall, I recommend ordering food to go from this place, and make your cornbread at home."}
{"text":"We went to Project 47 during Champaign County Restaurant Week. We arrived too early to order from the special menu so we ordered off the normal menu!

We ordered burnt ends and then the happy hour smoked wings special ($1/wing). We were a bit let down by the burnt ends --- they were dried out and didn't match what we're used to from Black Dog in CU. Definitely lacking flavor.

The wings were pretty tasty. We enjoyed dipping them in the variety of sauces brought to the table.

Tater tots were perfectly cooked and crispy!"}
{"text":"I would give this place one star based on my first experience when they opened. The food was terrible and they clearly needed some time to get their act together. We tried it out last week again. The food was much better this time. The prices for the sides are super high for what you get which is weird because the rest of the menu is very reasonably priced. The service still isn't great. I ordered an iced tea, asked my server for sugar twice (maybe she forgot the first time, no big deal) when she didn't bring it after the 2nd time I went to the bar and asked someone else. I'll probably go back sometime"}
{"text":"Great space. Bar area with additional tables for families, etc. Bartender was very attentive. Served many craft beers (I'm a domestic girl), but did see several on the menu. No bottle beer  but have cans and draft. We just went in for a snack and a beer, so we had the pulled pork sand which. Large portion size, 4 different barbecue sauce options.  The menu had several appetizers to choose from and several different sandwich, dinner choices."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  I was in town visiting a friend who suggested we get bbq.  I live in Chicago and love all types of bbq, but only if done right. 

It's clean and everyone is very friendly! I started with an Old Fashioned. My friend stuck to sodas.  They have a decent selection of whiskey and beer.  Definitely a great watering hole. 

I wanted to try a little of everything so I ordered the 4 meat platter. Wings, ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  I figured I'd take home what I couldn't finish. (Spoiler alert: there was nothing left to take home). 

The weakest meat on my platter was the brisket. It was really good but I like mine much more moist. It was still really good.  I would put some sauce on it next time.  

Next were the ribs.  Home run.  Really great flavor and done perfectly.  I'd pull off the highway for them ;). Great rub and beautiful color. Not over cooked and so tender.  

Next the wings.  I'm a wing fanatic and I've only found one place that had bbq-smoked wings that were good but not a home run.  This place rocked them!    

If the ribs were a home run then the wings were a grand slam.  I'm sorry I didn't get an order to go.  There only three on the platter which is perfect.  Really meaty large wings with a sweeter flavor and just so damn perfect.  

Finally the pulled pork was the best of the night for me. Flavor, moist and did I say flavor!!!

I can't believe it's three hours away for me.  I'd be here all the time for the people, drinks and eats.  

This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Well....got cheese curds as an appetizer. Was offered the option of full or half-order. Nice to have that option. Asked for ranch and marinara. We were not told of any up charge...yet we were charged for the ranch (because we make it in-house). It is common courtesy and good customer service to inform your consumer, especially of an up-charge. 

Then we got chicken tenders for 2 children. They are apparently expected to eat the chicken with ketchup or the provided BBQ on the table. What no ranch? Just as an FYI the chicken tenders are in the appetizer section and there is no kids menu; so this is one of the options for a child. It was also offered as a half-order which equaled two decent size tenders. Or a full-order equaled 4 tenders.

Next for the sandwiches...don't expect a side to come with them and with that price. You have to pay $2 or more for a side item. I got the pulled pork. It states that it is smoked for 12 hours...I beg to differ or maybe I just couldn't get the smoke from the sauce that the meat was saturated with. It does not state that there will be a sauce and besides when one comes to a BBQ joint one expects to be able to choose the BBQ sauce they would like to douse it with. The sauce that was on it was not appealing to me.

My brother got the turkey club in which he stated was mediocre. He doused it with different BBQ sauce.

His wife got the Brisket sandwich-she enjoyed it. There was not much for fat content, so it made for a drier sandwich.

The waitress...besides the fact that she did not tell us about the up-charge she tried to charge us for drinks when we had water. She also took a long time to come back for our food order and then again the food took a while to get to us...
All in all it was an edible meal, Just not fantastic."}
{"text":"We live locally and love this new Barbecue place. The meat is delicious and comes with 6 different sauces to try. They have daily specials, today was $2 tacos-yum!!! Our other favorite is the pork BBQ Mac and cheese. Share this as a side and you will have enough for leftovers tomorrow. The beers offered on draft are unique, localish, and seem to change regularly. Definitely the best restaurant in Mahomet!!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, layout is strange.    Food was average for the most part, got a chicken leg off the special that was bland and cold in the middle close to the bone."}
{"text":"Much improved since they initially opened.  The cuban sandwich is good, and the selection of sauces is better than average.  The waitresses are nice, but not the friendliest.  Atmosphere is ok, but could be better."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich which was wonderful! Now one of our favorite restaurants. Very smokey and the sauce selection was varied and tasty. Going back very soon! Well done!"}
