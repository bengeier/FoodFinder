{"text":"Great service and good food. Had the chicken and beef fondue and a friend had the scallop and steak fondue. The sauces were very good. The Chablis wine was a nice pairing, and the mussels in garlic cream sauce were very good. My friend had the pear entré and loved it. Big portions too."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by pointing out that I come here every January 1st for a big family gathering. Thus, I have given this 3 stars because while I like the place, I'm not sure if they might potentially merit more than three stars. Since the restaurant is closed for our private gathering, we have a fixed menu - it's possible that their regular a la carte menu deserves a higher rating. 

Location: On the North Shore, about 10-minutes from Laval and 20-25 minutes from downtown.

Service: Considering that we are always a very large group, the service is pretty good. I think they could potentially have 1-2 more waiters on hand, however the restaurant runs two private functions - one upstairs and one downstairs, so I'm guessing they split their limited staff to cater to both parties. 

Food: The last few years have seen the exact same menu items on the list, and I had grown so incredibly bored of these that I wasn't really looking forward to this year's event. Well the laugh was on me because they revamped our menu entirely. Here's what I had:

Salad: This was your average, run-of-the-mill salad. Leaves but no veggies besides some shredded carrot. Very low on the vinaigrette. That said, the salad was fresh. It just could've used a little sprucing up.

Escargots: I chose this as my 2nd course and despite the cream-based sauce, the snails were surprisingly good. They were fat and tender - not at all dry or shriveled up. Had I been paying attention when the wait staff explained the menu items, I would be able to tell you what kind of cream the escargots were bathing in - but sadly, I was not. The dish was very good, though there was more sauce than snails. A few more would have been good. 

Main: I opted for chicken stuffed with prosciutto in a basil sauce, accompanied by veggies and potatoes. Here's the thing: the chicken was AMAZING. It was tender and no knife was needed - I just used my fork and that was that. The prosciutto wasn't overpowering so the combination of bird and pork was perfect. The potatoes were a bit dry, so the solution to that would be to add a bit more sauce. The veggies were good. 

I skipped dessert - I hate white cake with caramel sauce. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and would definitely be interested in checking them out on a regular night to see how they fare.

The decor is kind of country-style and rather dark. I like a little more light."}

The atmosphere is intimate and cozy, perfect for a romantic dinner. My general observation would be that the prices are fair for the very good food that you get. We had the filet mignon and a veal cutlet. The filet mignon was wonderful, the cooking was perfect and we really liked the pepper sauce. The veal was more on the drier side but still tasteful. We also shared the raclette appetizer which is a plate of melted raclette cheese with potato balls on the side to dip in the cheese: delicious!"}
{"text":"Fab service and nice fixed prixe menu. Stumbled upon by accident but very happy we did."}
{"text":"je suis allé le midi et commandé l' assiette traditionnelle des fêtes. Micro portion de dinde avec farce au pain sans goût. Le ragoût de boulettes étais vraiment trop cuit et sec. Le pogo de tourtière était ok sans plus. Les légumes étaient bons .
Je ne retournerai pas. On me l' avait pourtant recommandé."}
