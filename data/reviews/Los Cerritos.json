{"text":"1 of D best mexican pleases in this town alittle jem burritos, Menudo is great"}
{"text":"Many say these drive thru Mexican food (allegedly) all taste the same. Maybe, but Cerritos people are awesome, they have milanesa prepared how u want it.  My favorite: California burrito w/pollo asado!"}
{"text":"Think of it like all of the Albertos, Albertacos, Ralibertos and the rest of the restaurants with the same menu and flavors.   We love all of these restaurants - but this one didn't give enough rice in our burrito (we ordered a bean, rice and cheese burrito, but it was by far beans - disappointing)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Real authentic food, and quick!  I frequent this place a few times a week."}
{"text":"Never had worse customer service in my life.  Have received to-go orders on numerous occasions that were wrong and they have absolutely refused to rectify the situation.  Thank God for the many options surrounding them as they will never receive the business of myself or anyone in my family again.  Armando's is my new home.  Los Cerritos lost a very loyal customer today."}
{"text":"Finally back on track, food taste awesome and your get good sized portions. Breakfast burritos are a must because you will not have lunch after one of these babies."}
{"text":"Come on late night snacks.and.food.are perfect.after.a long.night of.partying...this place is perfect...not.only for.late.night but for anytime but.it tastes best after a fun partying.night...i love the breakfast burritos, super nachos and carne asada fries...yum yum...so bad for you but so worth it because it tastes so good...i love it...its open 24 hours so you can go anytime.day or night...this is also by the perfect place for next.day hangover...good and.greasy food always helps...just make sure you do not have an upset stomach first cuz.then it will mot help.lol...gotta love it"}
{"text":"Best Carne asada Burrito, quesadilla and super nachos around here. Everything else I've tried is bomb, too. *edit/add- chicken Burrito is literally just marinated chicken. So good!"}
{"text":"Los Cerritos is a staple of my neighborhood. I was born and raised in Phoenix, and I moved away four years ago, and every single time I come back my first stop is this little Mexican food joint.  I cannot be in Phoenix for more than one hour without swinging through the drive through window for the Chile Relleno Burrito. DO NOT MISS THIS! It is the perfect balance of chile, cheese, and sauce wrapped up in a warm tortilla, and it is extremely reasonably priced.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside the service is quick and easy and the food is good and cheap. What more could you want??"}
{"text":"I ordered an el pastor burrito it was very greasy and no flavor. Very disappointed considering I was hungry ended up getting home to make something"}
{"text":"If I could give less stars I would. The food is ok but the service, especially in the drive thru is horrible!  The other day, at 11:30 AM I pulled in behind only one other car, placed my order for 1 menu item and then sat and waited for literally 15 min at closed drive thru window while the cashier totally ignored me.  Thankfully he didn't even open the window to take my debit card so after waiting patiently I finally drove off.  I hope his manager made him pay for the wasted food.  I've eaten there before and the food was ok but I won't go back!  Very disappointed in the lousy service."}
{"text":"Drain the oil out of the meat before you put it in the burrito! Listen to all your customers on yelp and change!! Complete and utter laziness. This place could be so great open 24/7, has a nice drive through. Pat down the oil how difficult is that. Recently ordered a California burrito, high quality ingredients but oil was seeping out the bottom. Had to stop halfway through because I was so disgusted with myself. My plate upon stopping (because I can't say finishing) looked like the Black Sea so much oil. Change people change! Will not be retuning until I see change."}
{"text":"You know, I gave this place another try and I don't think I'll be going back.  My burrito was greasy in a not-so-good way, which should not have been the case considering there was nothing in there that should've caused this.  As much as I'd like to give these guys a chance to change my mind again, I don't think I can do it - mainly because there is no pride in keeping the dining area tidy.  Its the least a burrito joint with a 15x15 dining area can do."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito in town!  Chorizo breakfast burrito with egg and cheese YUUUUMMMM. Drive through is always pretty quick and staff is so sweet."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite taco shop in Arcadia. My favorite is the Carnitas plate, it's so good! Gotta love the Mexican coke also, always compliments the food perfectly. I love that their drive-thru is hardly packed and always pretty quick to get you in and out. Not much more you can say about a no frills taco shop."}
{"text":"Average to good food if you're hungover or drunk. Haven't eaten there on any other occasion so can't speak to that. Might have given them three stars had it not been for the STUPID ASS CURB that extends PAST the drive through window on your right therefore forcing you to drive your car along the left side of the road like we're in god damn England. I LIVE IN AMERICA, LOS CERRITOS! I INSTINCTIVELY VEER MY CAR TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF ANY ROAD I'M ON. PLEASE DON'T BLOCK MY NATURAL PATRIOTISM WITH A GOD DAMN FOUR INCH PIECE OF CONCRETE.  So yeah, if you haven't guessed, I romp that curb every time I go through the drive through there and it moderately irritates me.   Service is slow. Hot sauce is weak. Two stars is all they get."}
{"text":"You know those \"Betos\" type burrito joints that occupy vacant Wendy's buildings and are in most cities?  This is slightly better then those offerings.  Still not bad when you want a greasy taco after a night out with the boys."}
{"text":"I come here for the rolled tacos and burritos. The food is always hot and made to order. I have only been here through the drive-thru and it always moves fairly fast. I tried their chorizo breakfast burrito one day but didn't like it. It was a bit too greasy and the sausage was really fatty, do not recommend. However, everything else I have tried is good. I love when I order a quesadilla and actually get a tortilla that is cooked all the way and even crispy!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and it was really good. We got chorizo and egg burrito and the cabeza tacos. I will probably make this my go-to fast Mexican fix in the future. From the limited menu we tried I would still recommend this place, for sure."}
{"text":"I was suprised this place is way better then philumberto and all the other .....umberto's places! I got a carnaesata burger witch was amazing! And I got a chicken burrito! The place was clean it's not a high end resturant and some people may think it's dirty because people have wrote on the walls, when I was there it was very clean nothing on the floors or tables. The food is inexpensive and good! I think I found my quite little mexican spot when I come to visit here!"}
{"text":"Los Cerritos serves up the best California Burrito in the area! The burrito itself is HUGE and stuffed with well-cooked and seasoned carne asada, potatoes, grilled onions, melted cheese, and some herbs and seasoning that make this like no other burrito. All this in a freshly made tortilla for only $4.99!   When we have a craving for Mexican food, we'll drive past the several other closer restaurants to visit Los Cerritos because the burritos are that good. I wasn't too impressed with the crunchy shredded beef taco, but the rice and beans were good and the lettuce was fresh. Now, I just stick to the burritos because they know how to make a mean burrito!   Like Roland W. and Stephen B. mentioned, sure this place doesn't look like much from the outside, but don't judge until you've tasted the food. The staff here are always friendly and take their time preparing the meal (not just thrown together in 30 seconds in a tortilla like they do at the fast food chains).   Los Cerritos is a small casual restaurant that serves up some tasty Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Los Cerritos is a place I've driven by many times and thought \"I would never eat there.\" Boy was I wrong. The food is actually very good.  While spending an evening Yelping last night I came across a restaurant located at 40th St. and Indian School (I often look at the address first while I browse) and it was rated four stars. I thought to myself, why haven't I ever tried it? As I looked at the name, I realized why. My preconceived notions were wrong.  Now I'm writing this review as I eat my take out burrito combination plate and I'm finding it to be very tasty. Plus, you get a lot of food for the money. I'm not typically a big eater, but my pollo burrito really hit the spot!  So the moral of the story is don't judge a book by it's cover. When in doubt check it out on yelp.com!"}
{"text":"One of the best fast food Mexican places in the area. Really tasty and the red sauce is excellent. I've been back a few times already. Love the california burrito and beef taco"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for the asada fries. We were going to stop at another place, but we decided to stop here when we saw a bunch of construction workers come in and a sign outside advertising asada fries. The dish is good and the salsas served with it elevates the dish. It is a large portion for a good price."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food Mexican by far!! Tortillas are the best and the people are very nice! Love this place, I drive 15-20 min just to drive thru and there are 3 other places right by my house!"}
{"text":"The lady was so rude with a stank attitude when I walked in that I immediately walked out. Tacos Sahuaro on 32nd is so much better and cheaper. Don't waste your time or money on this trash!"}
{"text":"One of my big pet peeves is when people review restaurants and bitch about how dingy, etc. it is before talking about what's really important.  the food. After all, you can see what you are getting into from the parking lot and ya still went in!!!!!  My pet name for places like Los Cerritos is 'El Divo', pronounced with a loooong 'i', and one of the things you can usually count on from little dives is great food. Los Cerritos doesn't disappoint. We pulled into the drive-thru yesterday morning, ordered breakfast and were treated to cheesy melty goodness wrapped up in fresh flour tortillas. My Bacon-Egg-Cheese Burrito had more bacon than anything else in it, a two fisted fattie just waiting to be crowned with green sauce. J's steak and egg burrito looked just as good. He asked me if I wanted a bite and with eyes glazed over I looked at him and said \"naw, I'm doing just fine here on my own...\" The dog drooled as we drove away, two hungry Mexican foodie fans quietly chewing their way to Nirvana.  P.S. that trip to Nirvana is available anytime thanks to the giant \"OPEN 24 HOURS\" sign you can see from a block away ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm sort of a Mexican food junkie. Constantly in search of the ultimate green chili (chile verde) burrito. I didn't see green chile on their menu, so I figured I'd try their take on a burrito stand staple: the mighty Carne Asada. The burrito was good. Beef was tender and flavorful, well seasoned. as any that I've had recently. Moist, but not filled with the juices the way that they can be sometimes (not that I necessarily mind them juicy, it's just a little messier). The pico de gallo had fresh chopped jalapeños in it, which was a bit of refreshing spice. Guacamole tasted freshly made. The tortilla was appropriately chewy and slightly crunchy the way they are if their done right. Not the biggest burrito I've had, but a decent portion, maybe slightly undersized for the price. But I would eat it again."}
{"text":"I really am a big fan of Los Cerritos.  Good fast-Mexican food.  The last time I ate there though, I had a takaway Chimi.  Slathered in fake sour cream.  disgusting.  I had to scrape it off.  I would still eat there, the super nachos are awesome, the guacamole is always fresh, the hot sauces are hot but the sour cream is fake.  Do not order the sour cream.  In fact, tell them not to use the sour cream.  It's fake.  And disgusting."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burrito and Horchata - delicious! Love that they put quac in the burritos!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for the last year and it has become our fast food Mexican restaurant of choice and there are plenty of others such places to pick from. They are fast, with good prices and a friendly staff.    I just had a shredded beef taco and it tasted great with very little grease, my wife claims they have the best torta around and their carne asada burritos are real ok.  For quick Mexican food it's a ok place to eat at."}
{"text":"It's near my house and the food is okay--not nearly as good as Juliobertos down the street. Don't plan on eating there the atmosphere is sorely lacking-actually, it's depressing. Just take the food home. There's not much more to say about it except the chicken burrito is huge and tasty--easily the best thing there...this is my \"go to\" Mexican  place if I don't feel like driving more than two blocks, so I go there often. LOL!"}
{"text":"I went there this morning for a breakfast burrito before work and it was decent except for the cook burning the crap out of the tortilla. The burned taste kind of overwhelmed the other ingredients. I'll probably try this place one more time and ask for no char but I don't see why people are raving about this place."}
{"text":"I think I must have ordered the wrong thing, since everyone seems to be raving about this place.  I tried the cheese enchiladas, which consisted of some red sauce (tasted the same as the red sauce I buy from the store to make my own enchiladas) poured over tortillas that were covered in non-melted cheddar cheese.  It reminded me of the fake enchiladas you get in public school cafeterias.  My husband had the nachos, which were nothing special.  I think we probably made the mistake of ordering the wrong items, but I'm not sure if we'll be back to have another go."}
{"text":"There are a million of these stupid burrito places, and they all taste the same. Unfortunately for this place, they always screw up my order, and don't really seem to give a shit.  I always order the cali burrito, which is a carne asada burrito with french fries in it(use sparingly, kids). Its always wrong... still tastes good, but something is always missing.  anyway. 2 stars"}
