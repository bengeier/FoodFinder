{"text":"While at the Farmers' Market for breakfast last week, I couldn't make up my mind which food booth to visit, until I realized Petit Mousse' crepes & galettes included an egg, guyere cheese & ham galette (savoury crepe). 

As this is one of my 'on the road' go-to meals when I travel, I was delighted at the idea of enjoying one at home. I got to watch them assembling it, and was impressed by the amount of meat & cheese they added, and also that they listened to my request to cook it a few minutes longer than normal (I like my eggs really well done & my crepes crispy). 

The first bite was a tiny bit of a disappointment for lack of fillings, but when I got to the middle, holy mama! It was the perfect blend of savoury, rich flavours, nicely offset by the crispy buckwheat crepe. It was filling and delicious, but I didn't feel uncomfortably full when I was done eating it. 

Paired with a cup of tea & a grey, foggy day outside, it immediately transported me back to many days in London or Paris when I've nibbled at one of these on my way to the train for a day's exploring. 

Tasty, filling, and memory-inducing for only $6? 

I'll be back!!

(Note: It's a cash-only business, so you'd better hit the bank machines first)"}
{"text":"installed in the food court at the Farmers market petit mousse  serves real Britany crepes and  galettes ( savory).  The complete with ham, cheese and egg is a must. For the crepe try the nutella/ banana.

Bon appetit"}
{"text":"Located in the farmers market it's a good pit stop when you're starting to feel hangry and need to refuel before you finish your shopping.  Partial to the sweet crepes and usually order something containing strawberries and whip cream. Yum so good."}
{"text":"While the food is great when available, this is the third time I've been turned away as they have nothing prepared."}
{"text":"Meh. Sweet crepes are nothing spectacular. Need some drizzle or whipped cream or something on top to make it appear more appetizing for $5.50...personally, I think. I feel I could absolutely have made this at home."}
