{"text":"My friend and I were visiting from out of town and decided to try this place out when we saw their groupon. The first thing we noticed was an empty parking lot at 7:30 pm on a holiday weekend. Awful location?  Upon entering we felt a little relieved with the warm reception from the young host. He found us a booth quickly and was kind enough to turn off the fan that was blowing our paper table cloth everywhere.   Although delivered quickly, after one sip of our Diet \"COKE\", it was obvious that it was RC Diet Cola and right from a flat 2-liter bottle.   The salad bar, if that's what you would call it, was slim pickens and only offered hearts of romaine and three dressings. They had some other Italian appetizers as well, ie. rolled deli ham and cheese cubes.   The hot plate section was not labeled and it took an explanation from the young host in order for us to know what the dishes were. The Chicken Cacciatore and Cheese Balls were incredible :)   Main course: As the first round of meats arrived, you can tell that they were made very recently. We received italian sausage, grilled pineapple, garlic bread, pork rib, grilled chicken, and top sirloin. They were up to par in taste and served from a hot skewer and the portions were fair.  We never received any tri-tip, leg of lamb, or filet mignon - all of which are advertised on their groupon/website!   The highlight of our underwhelming experience was the warm smile and friendly attitude from the head chef and his staff.   In all honesty, the groupon price we paid ($65 incl tip) is still a pretty high for what we received."}
{"text":"I took my husband for his birthday, it was not as advertised. They only had sirloin steak garlic and regular, marinated chicken, sausage, and pork wrapped in bacon. On their website they advertise leg of lamb, tenderloin, shrimp etc. But when I asked the cook started they were not available. I wish I was told at my arrival or when making my reservation! On top of that I asked for rare beef and only received super well or well... Again it was a birthday and I requested the dessert menu which never came but my check did. I paid in cash, but was chased down upon my exit by the cook explaining my waited said I didn't pay the bill. I flipped the billfold open and showed then the cash and they laughed and apologized. Did I mention I left a tip. We went to the cupcakery for dessert, but will never try this place again. The waitress came by the table once, and my husband went to her at the bar to get a refill on our drinks. Just all around poor service and false advertisement. I only gave them two stars because the food we ate, was seasoned properly just was cooked until it was steak jerky"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!  Upon being sat, we were immediately asked if we had a coupon, as it \"made things easier.\"  We were not given a menu or a price, and got dirty looks when we just ordered ice water to start.  That ended up being tap water and tasted AWFUL.  The salad bar left much to be desired, and not all items were labeled.  None of the salad dressings were labeled.  The waiters were very polite, but because we were in a steakhouse, our hearts were really set on steak.  They paraded around with a great deal of garlic breach (which WAS tasty), grilled pineapple (huh?), and loads of tough, dry chicken.  We were offered very little of the red meats, and that which WAS offered was far from adequate.  When we asked for filet, they told us it would be a while.  Approximately 30 minutes later, we were given tiny pieces of dry, old, badly seasoned  meat that they attempted to pass off as filet; but clearly wasn't.  Dirty plates piled up and drink refills were hard to come by.  After having asked for the filet and being sorely disappointed at its arrival, we were presented with the bill and thanked for coming.  There was no, \"Can I get you anything else?, or \"How was everything?\"  We were simply dismissed!!!  I guess we were being scolded for asking what is listed as a menu item on the website???  I later found that the price was $43.99 per person; however, our bill stated, \"Two dinners, $50 each.\"  WOW.  What a ripoff!!!  Don't waste your time or hard earned money visiting this establishment."}
{"text":"This was our first Brazilian restaurant and we wasn't sure what to expect, but if we had expectations, they would have been exceeded!  We started by visiting the salad bar, but before we could get too far into that, the staff started bringing meat skewers to the table. I could hardly keep up!  Everything they brought tasted awesome! One of the servers happily posed for a picture at the table to be shared on Facebook."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Just happened to be drivibg by. Food is excellent. Family run and own and everyone is very personable. Not quite as much variety as Texas De Brazil but don't have to deal with crowds and the noise either. Excellent Saad Bar. Will definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to a Brazilian steakhouse and so far the worst experience. A bit overpriced for what you get. Meat is ok, salad bar is terrible, and overpriced drinks. Service was ok, nothing to brag about. I won't go back."}
{"text":"The service and the meats were top notch.  I'll definitely be going again.  Very cozy."}
{"text":"Please let this review  serve as a warning.  This was the worst restaurant  experience my husband and I  have ever experienced. The staff was rude from the moment we called for directions. We were scolded with.  \" You better not be late\". We arrived on time and was then left waiting at the hostess stand  for 20 min.  We would have left but it was a $40 cab ride from the strip. (Not including 20% tip) The wait would have been understandable if there werent only 3 tables with patrons in the entire restaurant. The hostess was beyond rude and very condescending. She was not pleased we purchased a groupon. The Brazilian buffet was bare to say the least. It was only 7pm. There was only 1 gaucho  serving meats.  Service was slow. Servings were extremely  small and salty.   My husband likened the portion sizes to dog treats. I corrected  him.  There's no way any one would feed there beloved pets the meats they are serving the public.  Please proceed with caution.  please do your research before going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this restaraunt. For starters the website said they were open at 5:00pm, we had a 6:00 (mandatory) reservation and we got there at 5:30 so my girlfriend could sit at the bar and enjoy a glass of wine before our meal but they didn't open the doors until 6:00... The restrooms were disgusting, I lifted up the seat to go pee and there was dried up feices all over the toilet bowl and on the bottom of the toilet seat. I would have left right then but they told me when I made my reservation if I canceled without 24 hours notice the Groupon would be charged. We asked for medium rare meat and the majority of the steak was burnt past well done. Some tasted like beef jerky. The salad and soup bar looked like yesterday's left overs, they don't have any iced tea or sugar free beverages and the water came straight from the tap so I ordered a sprite which came in a  can and ended up costing me $6 each. The Groupon said the dinner included a desert, when the owner brought me our check I asked about it and she said that they were sold out. (Their were only four tables total ncluding us since the restaraunt had opened) I pointed out that the table by us just recieved the same desert that was supposed to be included in our groupon. At which point she went in the back and got us the flan which was a waste of energy because it was awful and we only took one bite. I would avoid this place if I were you."}
{"text":"Had dinner last nigh at this restaurant and I have to say.... one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The restaurant was cold and had a musty feel to it. My friend and I were the first guests there. The cold and hot salad bar was the weirdest thing I have ever seen. A couple of cheeses, potato salad, caprese with tomatoes that were hard as a rock, grilled artichokes that were odd. The hot salad bar had chicken Marsala, chicken Parmesan, mashed potatoes, a couple of unidentifiable soups..... yum right! NOPE!! It didn't look or smell like any of those titles. Then the waiter comes with the meat carving skewer things. Before he serves us he tells us that for $10 more we could have the premium meats and shrimp..... uuuummmm...... WHAT?? We didn't know there were restrictions to what you bought. We didn't \"upgrade our meal\" so we got maybe 5 basic cuts. Holy crap. The meats were harder than jerky and tasteless. Just nasty. Icing on the cake was when they brought us a small cup of coffee. When my friend asked for another she was told that it would be another $4..... horrible experience."}
{"text":"Being pregnant my appetite is always in season. And tonight it was roaring for something delicious and meaty. Well I've been looking for a new place to try And I stumbled upon a hidden gem in the desert when I arrived here. The meats are tender and mouth watering. The salad bar let me experience delicious Brazilian homemade items and the staff made me feel like I was at home. Everyone here is friendly and the food has me ready to comeback next time I'm nearby. Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"We are just visiting and thought we'd try this place out. We are so glad we did! These guys are GREAT! The owners are very welcoming and the food was authentic Brazillian. You have a great view of the strip from here as well!"}
{"text":"Food is hard and cold,,,,we have an appointment waited 15 minutes forgot about us in waiting room...we have to call the place to get us seated...only lasted 10 minutes after tasting the food...worst experience ever on this place..got stomach ache due to hard steak.....DO NOT GO....dont waste your money.."}
{"text":"Quite simply, this restaurant is amazing!!! The staff was extremely helpful and attentive. The hostess and whom I believe is the owner, are both extremely charismatic and charming, making the experience absolutely pleasant. The rest of the staff follows suit and makes every second of the meal perfect. The food is no joke either. There is a buffet line with a plethora of delicious Brazilian dishes and sides. The meat that is served table side is cooked to perfection. It simply melts in your mouth and gives you a sense of pure food extesy. There is a large variety of wines that you simply should indulge on. If you are looking for something new to try then look no further. The decor is briliant, the people are amazing, and the food is to die for."}
{"text":"I have never written a negative review before but Bertolucci's Brazilian Steakhouse deserves it. The service was extremely slow, food selection was very limited and boring. I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses where the meat servers come around several times to your table during your meal but this place only served the meat three times with mediocre meat. Bertolucci's was a BIG disappointment. They add an 18% gratuity to your bill that they DON'T deserve. NOT worth your time money.  I gave it one star because you have or I would give it a MINUS 5 star review if that was possible. STAY AWAY! This place is a ripoff!"}
{"text":"This place a joke. Compared to the other Brazil steakhouse we have been to this is not wroth the drive. Let alone they changed us an 18% gratitude on a table of 4. Meet was dry along with the pineapple was over cooked. Desert was canned fruit on the salad bar. Not wroth the money."}
{"text":"Four of us tried this restaurant 11-14-15. We had been to Pampas (Planet Hollywood) countless of times so it was fitting that we would compare Bertolucci to it. Service at Bertolucci was a lot better. We all agreed that the meats served on our table at Bertolucci were tastier and cooked just right. The buffet table at Bertolucci had plenty of choices. The caesar salad dressing seemed to be from a bottle and the beef soup (labeled erroneously as chicken soup) was too salty. However, the chicken salad, coleslaw, warm chicken dishes , fried corn bread on the buffet were good. Overall, we recommend this 'neighborhood gem' to those visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great. A more personal experience compared to the big Brazilian steakhouses. We enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The experience was great, first time doing this style of eating. The only parts about it that were ok is how fast you received each meat. And the finale of it all. I wish there was more to desert but im a sweets girl. The meats were delicious, especially the steaks. Oh my they were amazing. Even the grilled pineapple was delicious. They have a serve yourself sides. The chicken salad was really good, so was the salads. Although being the first time id probably save the room for the table side meat. Overall the service was great, the owner lady was really sweet and very kind. They explained everything well, id definitely recommend this to anyone. What an experience for our one year wedding anniversary. Thank you."}
{"text":"Not worth the groupon we used!! Meat was over cooked or flat out raw. The hot side items like beans were cold...meat was stringy..."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, outstanding service, excellent value.  This is a hidden neighborhood gem that is worth the trip from anywhere in Las Vegas.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Just run away. So salty -Terrible waiting time for the meat, the salad bar is a joke- you might as well buy your own steaks at home. Burnt meat and super fatty, did I mention SALTY?! Oh my goodness just awful seriously awful"}
{"text":"Food was not good. 18% gratuity on party of 4 and taxes are not included in the groupon. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely HORRIBLE! We purchased this deal on Groupon and made a reservation for 4, got there and waited at least 5 mins to be acknowledged. As soon as the hostess brought us to our table, there were only 3 other parties in there. Not busy at all. The ambiance was blah, I felt like I was in a Denny's and not a nice Brazilian Steakhouse. There salad bar isn't the best of quality, quite frankly I think they purchase the items from the deli @ the grocery store and put it out, not much effort in it. The fruit salad at the end of the bar is canned fruit, the meats were cold, dry and flavorless. Wait let me take that back, majority of my meats tasted like metal, possibly from the skewers. My boyfriend ordered an Ice Tea and that tasted like poison, we had to share 2 huge tongs among 4 people and when the guy with the meat came to our table he never walked around the table to each party, I was always reaching over or having someone else reach across to get the food to me. The grilled pineapple was WAY OVER COOKED along with the meats. Service wasn't that great, there was a long waiting time in between the meats and we decided to end our meal as soon as we were done with the bottle of wine and as we were walking out the host had the audacity to bring us a bill charging us tax and a mandatory gratuity of 18% for a party of 4. Let me remind you, this was purchased through Groupon. The deal was dinner for 4 and a bottle of wine for $132. NOWHERE in the fine print on groupon did it state that we would get hit with taxes and a mandatory gratuity. The lady never mentioned any of this at the beginning and we didn't see anything posted about that until we were walking out and she stopped us by the bar with the bill. At that time is when she pointed out the mandatory gratuity on a sign at the back of the bar. I don't think I would've even left 15% of a tip after that experience.  I have never had to pay taxes on a meal that was set in stone like that. I have paid taxes if the deal was something like $10 for $20 worth of food and we went over. Only then have I had to come out of pocket. If you are looking for a nice atmosphere, great service and meats that are bursting with flavor among flavor and tender, juicy meats, you should check out Via Brasil. That is definitely our go to and will continue to be our go to when we are craving a Brazilian Steakhouse. Absolutely love that place."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional, the service is even better. The owner is full of charisma and makes it a pleasure to be at this establishment."}
{"text":"My fiance and i purchased a groupon and boy were we glad we did!  To be honest, when we pulled up to the restaurant, i was disappointed. I immediately thought we would regret going. It looked very dark, small and old from the outside. When we walked in, i felt relieved. It had the family-friendly, warm and cozy type atmosphere.  We were instantly seated and from there it was a complete turnaround. I must say we were greeted by a very nice and polite server. We got some food from the salad bar and everything was delicious. Once our server started serving us the meat... OMG! Fan-freakin-tastic!  We didn't wait too long for the meat, they kept them coming fresh and hot. They were cooked to perfection!  The price was reasonable, even without the groupon.  I would definitely go back for a casual dinner with the family!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for AUTHENTIC Brazilian food this is your place! Also great service!! Friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Don't know where to begin, guess the best thing there was the bottle of cheep wine which came with the Groupon voucher. The Salad bar and buffet were worse than in a cheap $7.99 hotel buffet and the meat was nothing special. Not even the Groupon savings could make up for this experience."}
{"text":"This place is no Fogo.  Don't expect to get any filet.  We asked for filet 2-3 times and after about 45 minutes finally got a couple of pieces that they said was filet.  It was either sirlon or the worst filet that my wife and I ever had.  We heard two other tables also asking for filet.  The Brazilian steak was good."}
{"text":"My sister bought this Groupon for my husband & I as a gift.  After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical to go, but we decided to give it a try since it was a gift.  We were both pleasantly surprised.  The food was great & so was the service.  Everything has a lot of flavor.  We loved their chimichurri, which they make there.  The salad bar was a little small, but again still had a lot of good flavors."}
{"text":"The place is truly a hidden gem the meats were cooked to perfection and fresh; the service was great and price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Holy crap bad ass place to eat.... pls save your money and go to pampas they also have a groupon. But at pampas they dont charge you 20 percent gratituity for 4 people..... isnt this place all you can eat? Charged 6 bucks for 2 diet cokes.....  Then bam charged tax? Pampas didnt charge tax so i dont know whatsup it seems like a double dip...   Btw asked for drinks then guy forgot... isnt deserving of the 26 dollar tip.  Forgot to say my sister threw up here from the meat... i think its spoiled  Now that we made it home me and my girlfriend is feeling a little groggy and sick.  We did not drink the wine.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, SPEND IT AT PAMPAS...."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place. Me and my boyfriend bought a groupon for there guessing it would be good considering how deceiving the pictures and descriptions are about it. I also see how many reviews that have had the same experiences as I have and owner has the nerve to talk back instead of taking the criticism and using it for change the restaurant for the better.            I should probably start my experience with what I saw when I first walked in. Corny karaoke music that was playing the entire time and let me say this music was driving me CRAZY. This place also had a salad bar that looked like trays from a grocery store was put on regular plates and served.  The staff was super awkward and did not seem friendly at all.          After that, we kept on getting served grilled pineapple Which we did not want anymore but they kept on asking if we wanted it.          The most kind of meat that we got was chicken. FIRST OF ALL, this place is a Brazilian STEAKhouse. STEAK. Not a Brazilian chicken house. After we insisted on more steak, they gave us a little bit more and then they cut us off.           We left still hungry and the most my boyfriend ate there was store bought flan."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday, November 8th, 2014.  First of all, the service was terrible.  The salad bar is very meager...nothing like the Texas de Brazil , nor Pampas for the prize Bertolucci's charges even with Living Social.  Here's the kicker...I asked for A-1 steak sauce and immediately afterwards they asked if they could have it as perhaps another customer wanted it.  I said yes but later I asked for it again.  They gave me (I assume was the same bottle but added water) a bottle and soon as I poured it on my plate it ran out like water.  Gross!  The quality was mediocre and when we left a small tip got dagger looks from the hostess/food server who BTW, all the time was just busy with adding up the tabs instead of attending to the customers.  FAIL!!!!!   Should have left immediately when we stepped in because my husband and I took one look at the place and was very disappointed.     Oh and the responses of this Patricia....classy....I told all my friends about this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. My wife & I tried to come previously but they were closed. She found a groupon for them & we decided to try again. DEFINITELY WORTH THE RETURN VISIT.  The previous reviews were correct in citing the size of the salad bar. It is pretty small, but I like the offerings & let's be real you don't come to a place like this for the salad. The fried bananas were soooo good I think they are my new favorite food.   The meat was absolutely wonderful. Filet was like butter, lamb chops seasoned very well, sausage was good. There was only one piece of meat I didn't like (ribeye) because it had a lot of fat, but the flavor of the meat was spot on. I'm not a big red meat eater but it was difficult passing up on any of their offerings.   The speciality drink Caipirinha was good, strong, and flavorful. Do not leave without having the official cocktail of Brazil. The owners are sooo sweet & even personally made sure I had my own plate of lamb chops & our drinks were quite generous.   We will definitely be coming back, and we will be bringing friends. Those who rated it badly & said they would not come back GREAT more room for my party. If you are hesitant use one of the groupons/specials. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Meat was seasoned perfect and it was served timely. Don't waste your time on the salad bar and go straight to the side dishes. Service was good and served cans of coke"}
{"text":"Saw roaches on the floor. Waitresses were hella rude. Complained to the manager and she spit in our faces and cursed us out. The chef looks like a fat sweaty slob. Just a horrible experience. Customer service is foreign to them."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out because we found their deal on Groupon and we were not disappointed! The owners were amazing and were checking up on us throughout the meal. The food was just what you would expect from a high-end Brazilian Steakhouse, they had so many different meats going around that it seemed like we tasted everything once and were almost too full to get seconds on out favorites!   The owners really facilitate a family-style atmosphere and that has my wife and I wanting to get back there soon. (We brought our one-year-old and she had a blast as well.)"}
{"text":"Does anyone read the responses from Patricia S. She apparently is an employee of the restaurant. Why support a restaurant that allows their employees to treat customers with such a bad attitude.  Gross."}
{"text":"Went there on a groupon.  When I first pulled up, I was kind of disappointed.  Wasn't expecting much to be honest.  It was in an older shopping center.    The atmosphere was ok.  It wasn't busy, only us and 2 other tables.  The food bar, was ok.  Some of the selections, weren't that good.  Meatballs was more like ground meat.  Chicken was good, stragonoff was ok, and the salad bar was decent.  But the meat they brought out?  was pretty good.  I never had lamb before, and I didn't like it.  But I am not sure if that is just the taste, or if they cooked it weird.  Some of their pieces was kind of dry, but I just asked for another piece, and it was fine.  Overall, the meat was good, and the grilled pineapple was awesome.    What made this place great was the service..  We really enjoyed the 2 servers we had.  They brought out the meat at a quick pace and checked in on us quite often.  Service was much better than at other places such as Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon coupon for Bertolucci and had never been there.  We've tried the other Brazilian style steakhouses in town and decided to try something new.  The Groupon requests you make reservations, which we did, and addresses a \"dress code\".  We dressed appropriately, not knowing what to expect.  When we arrived, we were taken by surprise by the size of the business.  It's a bit small.  There was karaoke going on in the corner.  It was a little loud and the music was not proper for that type of business (Puff, the Magic Dragon?).  The hostess explained everything to us and sat us away from the karaoke. We kept an open mind. The salad bar was small, but the food was good and fresh. The meat began to show up almost immediately.  Most of it was overcooked to our liking, but the waiter brought back more meat cooked to our liking.  The red meat was very good. The chicken and pork wrapped with bacon was very well done, very dry.  The seasoning on the meat is unique and not salty like the other steakhouses, almost like a marinade.  As far as the employees attitude, everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  We were greeted when we came in, the family's history was explained to us during dinner and we were thanked as we left.  If you like supporting family business and having their gratitude, this is the place."}
{"text":"No good !!!!! The lentil soup was heavy on the salt, not much varieties of salads, ONLY ONE Dessert !!!! Horrible service I had a soda .  And they never came by to offer more or another one we had to keep on asking for more .  May I add the there was only 2 other tables there.. Would never have o back and Never Recommend to a friend !!"}
{"text":"If you're craving family style Brazilian BBQ in Las Vegas, then Bertolucci Brazilian Steakhouse is your place to go! The food and service here are excellent.   We found out about Bertolucci because of our hotel concierge. It was recommended as the \"best value for all-you-eat Brazilian BBQ in town\". With such credentials, we decided to check the place out.  Arriving there, we were promptly met by a friendly hostess who offered us a comfortable table, with a gorgeous night-view of the Strip. The place is kept very clean and tidy. Our drinks and appetizers were served promptly and even before we had the chance to visit the salad bar, the first round of the meat was being offered at our table.  The staff were very friendly, always asking us if we had any preference for a specific cut of meat, at the same time ensuring that we never had to wait to refill our drinks - one of my greatest pet peeves!  At the end of the night we were surprised by the Chef, who personally sang a couple  karaoke songs. He even asked us if we had any favorite song we would like him to sing.  Result: Great food - very fresh and well cooked - with plenty of variety, excellent service and a comfortable atmosphere that made us feel like we were eating BBQ at our best friend's house as we watched the games at their 80\" TV while sipping on some Caipirinhas."}
{"text":"We decided to try Bertolucci for mother's day, we heard the place is new, and we wanted to compare the food to other brazilian restaurants in town. To our amazement we realized that this is not  typical brazilian restaurant food, but more close to down home cooking..... the service was excellent...we had a very good time."}
{"text":"Probably the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at. We were the only ones there, which should have been a red flag. I'm used to eating at Brazilian steakhouses like Via Brasil and Texas de Brazil. We were served one-bite sized portions of flavorless, overcooked meat. We all felt a little sick after eating and the next day. Disgusting, can't believe we paid $30 each for that poor excuse for Brazilian food."}
{"text":"at first glance theres no way i would stop and eat here as a romantic getaway the outside isnt nothin pretty to look at and when i walked in there was nothing spectacular about the place buuuuut all that changed when i tasted the food hands down the food has soo much flavor im a big steak eater and i was impressed by the flavor if your coming here to look for the glamour and lights this place is not for you but if you want a real family oriented business with great tastin food then your in the right spot"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience. We purchased a Groupon and made a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday night. We were immediately seated. The staff was attentive and friendly.  The food was served hot and slightly before we finished the last serving. I will add that they might want to think about expanding the salad bar. I would recommend them. Diane W"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had in Vegas. Way over priced for the food and service. I will not be going back and ANY buffet would have been better. Service doesn't exsist we couldn't even get water.  For all you can eat, there was nothing to eat. They were out of everything in the food bar and the meat was taste less and rarely came around. This place deserves negative stars"}
{"text":"They call themselves 'the best authentic Brazilion food in town'. I concur! Not only is the food great, the staff is what makes this place a pleasure to go.  The salad bar is the best in town.  Everything is fresh and delicious! The meat! Awesome is the only way to describe it. Rib Eye, Filet, Sirloin, Flank Steak, Pork wrapped in Bacon and I think I'm forgetting a few.  All cooked to order and perefection. GO!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars; please do yourself a service and eat literally anything else, instead.  The only redeeming factors were the wine and the slightly more than acceptable fried banana.  This restaurant is a celebration of complete mediocrity. If that.  The salad bar was terrible and included actual rolled up cold cuts, warm imitation crab, and extremely wet \"potato salad\".  The sides included rice, beans, chicken soup, and a few other equally bland choices.  Once the meat train began, we were treated to mostly tough, small servings of unseasoned steak, chicken, pork, and sausage.  They were all equally lacking in flavor and there was no break in between each item being brought to the table.  We ended up with a small, unappetizing meat pile that left us refusing additional pieces because of the unpalatable nature and absolute lack of desire.  The dinner as a whole was uninspired and I wish I had spent my $155 on literally anything else."}
{"text":"Owner is so appreciative of your business and will go out of his way to ensure you have a good experience  Service is 5 stars, meats were delicious, the salad buffet was ok not the biggest selection I have seen at other places, but good value for money  Groupon was good value for money and the drinks were delicious  They want to do a good job and are so open to feedback Would go again"}
{"text":"We used a groupon and I regret it. This place is a disgrace! We came for dinner at 7 and everything was gone. Our waitress assured us they would refill the potatoes, rice, etc but it never happened. The meat was either too salty or too over cooked to even eat. We had a party of 4 and were hit with a gratuity charge which ended up not saving us any money with the groupon we purchased. This place is terrible! Save your time and money! Oh, thanks for the free bottle of barefoot wine which by the way, costs $5 from the grocery store! What a joke!"}
{"text":"Let me start with this:  Please make a reservation before you go.  It helps the Chef have the appropriate amount of food prepared when you arrive.    The restaurant is family owned and operated and this shows in all of the best ways: personal attention, great service, and tailoring the food to your personal tastes.  We were shown to our table quickly, and started with the salad bar and hot buffet.  Yes, yes... it is smaller than Texas De Brazil or other big chain restaurants but all of the offerings were tasty and I found plenty to fill a plate before the Passadores (the night we went it was the Chef/Owner and his Son) started bringing around skewers filled with perfectly seasoned and well-cooked offerings.  The meat selection is similar to what you would find at the goliath chains but two things stood out:  the handmade sausages and the marinated chicken thigh.  The sausages were seasoned perfectly, had just enough fat to make them juicy, and were in natural casings that gave a very nice snap.  The chicken thighs were marinated in (I think) beer, wine, garlic, and herbs that made them incredibly flavorful.     I'd love to say I will be back often, but I don't think my waistline could handle it!  I will certainly be back and I hope you decide to give this local gem a try."}
{"text":"Well what can I say.  The owners are very nice and try.  I think the wife should do more then seat people.  She could pass food around while the husband cooks diff meats.  They use like four of the same meats but say their different, for example adding garlic sauce on it counts as one.  Wine comes with the Groupon, however if you don't want it, you only get one soda.     I started feeling sick before I left and believe I have food poising.  I've been gone less then 25 mins and been in the bathroom three times already.      The meats are cooked on the grill not like Texas de Brazil when they have all the meats cooking on a rotational cooker.   I would try it.  Spend they extra 10 and go to Texas de Brazil..    I wanted to like this place, I did.. oops back to bathroom!!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon and visited here last evening. We only recently moved to the area so Groupons are the best way for us to try places out. I worried because the place was rather empty. But what a wonderful surprise! The food was delicious!! Hot, fresh....just wonderful! The Chicken Stroganoff on the food bar was to die for! And the grilled pineapple....the flan....the marinated chicken....the pork ribs.....all just wonderful!! The staff was even better! Attentive and pleasant. The owner spent time talking with us and even sang some karaoke for us! Not bad!  This will be one of our regular stops from now on!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Awful! Opened late to begin with. Sign says 4p, called at 5:20p they said 6p... waited til 610p called AGAIN and he said give me a few more mins. Now there was 3 couples waiting to go in. Called A THIRD TIME, he now says they are not open but serving at a different location due to a water line break. WTF! An hour later, no signage & they want us to drive 20 mins to another location. Like I said AWFUL!!"}
{"text":"I regret even having to give this place one star. This was a horrible place to eat. The salad bar was appalling with hardly any salad or food . The food that had been sitting out there was luke warm. But of course we were there for the meat so we waited. After they brought out a few rounds of fatty white/dark meat chicken they finally brought out a rough beef jerky like slice of beef. That was the last semi-good piece of meat we got. Everything else, round after bloody round was dripping rare. When we complained to the owner after two hours we got no help. We did get an angry Brazilian with a knife come to tell us that we didn't have anything to complain about because we didn't make reservations. (There were three tables with ppl in them). When we were finally done waiting for meat that was edible we had to ask for the check (which was full price by the way). $84 dollars for some ice berg lettuce and a lot of dinner rolls. We were never offered a discount or coupon to come back and we complained at the end too. This was a really really bad experience. Lol, the lady who is commenting can't even take some honest criticism and try to make her place better. This is so professional. Maybe this is why the Italian restaurant of the same name shut down? I never once complained about the price, I have been to a lot better places than this one claims to be. I also consider myself to be pretty patient. All I wanted was some steak, at a steak house, it should not have been this hard haha. Well, for me, this is just one night. Unfortunately for this poor woman, it's her whole life."}
{"text":"Feels very homie, you will get full quick so pace yourself. Not crowded very intimate"}
{"text":"Phenomenal, from beginning to end!      I  truly can't remember the last time I had a dining experience like this, wait, yes I can, it was when we were invited to the home of our best friends.  Bertolucci was exactly the same.  I even enjoyed making the reservation on the phone!  Words can not  begin to describe the warmth when you walk in the door.  The enticing journey begins at the door, the smiles and smell of the food, well, had me quite excited to get to my seat. What occurred after that?  A dazzling, delectable dinner, chicken parmesean, filet mignon,  roasted pork  with bacon, ribs so delicious, no need for sauce or a knife. THE most dazzling display. Garlic bread, yes, cooked and served Brazilian style as well....the bread, homemade so succulent, nearly melted in my mouth. A dish  or 2 of mashed potatoes so good, I'm not even going to attempt to describe the fluffy, hot, buttery delight! I haven't even started to describe the salads, the hot dishes available for you to help yourself.  Homemade, with love and dedication best describes it all. This family restaurant is unparalleled in this city. No pretenses, no way for you to understand  the tastes, the family,  the sheer delight, until YOU walk in the door.  I am a life long resident and complete food addict, 5 stars simply aren't enough. This IS my new favorite place, a gem for sure. I will be a customer, fan for life.......this is simply like dining with family. Worth every single cent. Don't skip dessert either, it is amazing as well.  Thank you Bertolucci Family, for the smiles, the conversation,  for making us feel like we were guests in your home. Yes, we will see you soon! Probably again next week, I'm already craving another round of EVERYTHING!  It appears to me, that so many use Yelp to complain,  but this is a forum intended to guide, the rare phenomenon of a meal  like this is what I turn to Yelp for.  Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Great quality meat cuts, not overlooked and better yet the customer service was amazing. Ask for Humberto to sing you a song. He made my date and I laugh and we danced to his karaoke jams. He is really good. Highly recommend. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Just went with a Groupon for four.  It included four all-you-can-eat dinners and one bottle of wine.  Overall, a great deal.  IF you are going with the Groupon, just know you will receive a bill with tax and a mandatory 20% tip, I would have tipped about that much anyway, but the Groupon fine print didn't state any of that, so I'll have to make sure that is changed...  The salad bar itself is a little sad.  It reminded me more of a grocery store salad bar than anything, with canned products poured into containers over ice.  The meats you normally see (salami, ham, etc...) looked very store bought, didn't have that artisan look you see at other steakhouses.  But, really... if you are paying attention to the salad bar at a Brazilian Steakhouse, there's something wrong with you, right?  So me passing that by was no big deal.  Behind the salad bar, there is a hot station full of meats and sides, they had a container for \"meatballs,\" but there no meatballs in sight.  What there was, however, was this sort of pot roast dish that I kept qoing back to all night, great stuff.  The chicken fritters were also great, but ran out at the beginning of the night, and they never refilled them...  The meats they serve were mostly great, many were overcooked but still had some flavor to them.  The leg of lamb they have trumps both Texas de Brazil and Via Brazil, easy.  Aside from being overcooked, I'd have to say the only issue is frequency of the meats.  The guys only came around once every 5 minutes with something new.  So, you get one piece of a steak, eat it within a minute (the pieces aren't that big,) and then wait a few minutes for anything else to happen.  Places like this should be bombarding you with choices, not giving you what they can when they can.  All that being said, because of the Groupon, all four of us received a decent meal, and some wine for around $35 a piece including tax and tip.  I would go back."}
{"text":"All the meat was sooo yummy. I didn't have a big enough stomach to try everything. Staff is amazing friendly very informative. Kind of in a random spot but the food is good. Prepare to starve all day to eat all the ono food."}
{"text":"I don't care how many phony reviews on this place they post.  This place is the worst dining experience I have had since I moved to Vegas 3 years ago. They charge 29.99 for an experience that is not even worth $9.99.  In over an hour of dining never saw a skewer of filet, lamb, or flank steak.  I guess they had to get rid of everything they did not sell for lunch.   Should have known better when they were empty on Saturday night."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try an all you can eat steakhouse! I'm glad I chose this as my first. I took my aunt and uncle there because they've been driving me all over Las Vegas, even picking me up at 7am from the strip. So I thought it'd be nice if I did something special for them, as they love steak also! Once we entered we were immediately greeted by the host, and brought to a table. She explained the process and how this place runs, as this is everyone's first time at this restaurant.  Everyone was very friendly, always saying excuse me and please, when slicing the tender steaks onto our plates. They were even nice enough for us to have a photo op with them! Some people believe 25% tip is too much, but they really were exceptional. I felt that wasn't enough, I just didn't have enough to give them more!"}
{"text":"My husband bought a Groupon thinking it was for a sumerlin location and we didn't realize until we hit directions that he bought the wrong Groupon. We drove down here from the northwest and read reviews and looked at pictures before we got to our dinner. We were really looking forward to this night out and have wanting to try a Brazilian steakhouse.  First I want to say the service was friendly and I'm sorry to give such a bad review on a small business as I know how hard it is. But this was horrible. First of all salad bar really. These sides should go with all the meat we are going to eat. And there isn't anything really to even put on your lettuce !Second the pictures on your yelp page you should have flagged they aren't even (most) of this establishment, third the meat you say you have didn't even all come out.  We had all red meat and 1 sausage and it was not high quality.  We have paid less than this Groupon to feed 4 instead of 2 to eat at the buffet at alliante on steak night and had better quality (which isn't a super high quality buffet). We are still hungry and headed home disappointed in a $69 Groupon dinner for 2"}
{"text":"We have had dinner at many churascaria restaurants here in the Vegas area and this is by far the worst . We called ahead of time for dinner pricing and the check was  double the price we were quoted by phone for our two kids . We were not served all the meats they advertise for dinner and servings were few and far between . Our first serving of meat was 45 minutes after we arrived and they deli slice the meat paper thin . HORRIBLE !!!!! RIP OFF!!!!"}
{"text":"Was worried based on some if the negative reviews in Yelp, but we really enjoyed it.  Service was great and all the meat was good.  I especially liked the Brazilian flan.  Much richer than the Mexican flan and very similar to my favorite dessert, Venezuelan quesillo."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly, and the meat selections were good, but the salad bar paled in comparison to other Brazilian Steakhouses."}
{"text":"Service was exceedingly slow (more than twenty minutes between servings) and quality was lacking.  There were few fresh offerings at the salad bar and we were presented with the wrong bill twice.  After reviewing what was supposed our bill, the math was flawed but we paid the nominal difference without  complaint just so we could leave."}
{"text":"Ate here on a groupon. The charged 18% automatically. The salad buffet was dirty and nasty. The meat was not impressive at all. They kept bringing all the low quality ones. For all the money we spent on tip and drinks not included we could have had a great meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this zero stars as I am currently writing this review from my bathroom no more than two hours after my visit with my fiancé. Did I mention she is in the other bathroom.   We thought this might happen when the server had to stop himself from giving us the marinated chicken when he noticed it wasn't cooked properly. Unfortunately we had already had it the first time he came around with it. Although the flavor was not bad the food obviously was not cooked, handled, or prepped properly or a combination of the three. Once this happened we were out the door.  For the time we were there we only \"sampled\" the marinated chicken, bacon wrapped pork and chicken, and the top sirloin. When I say sampled the portions were bite sized as well so it wasn't like some Brazilian steakhouses where you could enjoy the food for a period of time. Also the pork and chicken was cold to warm and not hot like one might think.   We should have left before we even walked in as my fiancé had doubts as we walked in to find a lack luster ambiance, tinsel hanging from the ceiling, a karaoke stage, huge tv, a server with a nike baseball hat on, a hostess who my fiancé pointed out should have done a better job hiding her lace thong underwear under her skin tight dress she was wearing, and the paper covering the table clothes as to say look I'm a tacky afterthought because we don't want to wash our linens.   The cost of this was a $50 groupon which only saved us $5.00 per plate because the actual cost per person is $29.99.  I will leave it to the audience of this review to determine if you would pay even half or request to be paid to deal with the inconvenience of this restaurant and it's health risk.   I hope the health department reads this review and at the very least does an inspection followed by stiff fines or a shut down."}
{"text":"***Family owned and operated***  I bought this Groupon and didn't know who owned it... But I'm very Proud of this guy and his wife... They came from Brazil broke... He used to sell dinners in my barber shop out of his trunk for like 3 years... every day... Now they own his place... It's just the two of them and  they work very hard to make sure your happy...  The place is very comfortable and cozy and the guy cooks great the meat is seasoned just right...  Get their Groupon..."}
{"text":"The meet was super good, the buffet was limited. The service was amazing Would I come here for 60$? No. But I had a restaurant.com gift certificate so I tried it. The let is request additional meat, ask for extras of our favorite, and kept up a lot on our drinks. Based on service it's a five, food a four (because of the limited buffet) and price i would make a three."}
{"text":"I love Brazilian steakhouses so I booked this for my daughter's 21st birthday.  I purchased a couple of Groupons so that my family could go with us.  I spoke with the owner during the day about changing my 7 pm reservation to 6 pm.  He said \"yes\".  When we arrived the hostess/wife was really rude and said we couldn't come in because our reservation was for 7 pm.  He spoke up and said he approved the change.  Our table was set up ahead of time.  She immediately asked if we had a voucher.  I said yes, two. She was extremely rude again and said we could only use one per table.  They had lots of empty tables.  I asked if we could separate to use both Groupons.  Again the answer was no.  At that point I just wanted to get the experience over with.  I understood them not wanting us to use two Groupons and was okay with that.  The hot and cold salad bar was very limited.  The salad ran out and was never replaced.  The beans had a metal wire in them.  When we told the owner he said it was from washing dishes with a metal Brillo pad.  The meats were not offered to everyone at our table.  And we were not given tongs.  When we asked for them they gave us a few to share.  There also is no way to signal that you want or don't want more meat.  A stop or go sign is tradition at every Brazilian Steakhouse.  We finished hungry.  Last, the owner told us that we could have access to all they meats if we paid ten dollars more.  Apparently, the Groupon limits you to 7 meats.  I said no because we were already paying 43.99 per person because we couldn't use the second Groupon.  I know the owners troll people that write unflattering reviews.  Heads up - don't write back to me because I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Too bad its so close to home and so terrible. Read the comments about food poisoning, bad service, limited selection of meats, dishonesty towards Groupon deals, etc. NOT like other Brazilian places. This churrascaria is destined to close someday. They either change their ways or they will be forced to close its doors with a lawsuit. Sad."}
{"text":"The experience I had here was extraordinary.  The food is wonderful.  The attention to us was exceptional.  I was so happy with this place.  They had live entertainment which was pretty good, but when the chef left his post to sing a few songs in Portuguese/Spanish, it really got fun.  People here love their job and it shows."}
{"text":"we used their coupon special and were quickly hooked. The salad selection was perfect, and their already prepared fare was delicious. I recommend the chicken cacciatore and Brazilian chicken , but there are options to meet everyone's personal tastes. As you settle in they bring by delectable skewers of perfectly seasoned /roasted meats, until you can't eat any more. desert is included to end a delightful meal. The staff was friendly and quick to make you feel comfortable. Henderson is not far from the Vegas strip , and I would recommend Bertolucci's above the other hyped Brazilian restaurants."}
{"text":"My partner and I purchased an all you could eat deal through Groupon. We were extremely excited. We had to make a reservation for 6, prime dinner time so figured it would be busy. Once we arrived the place was dead! Not a single soul! So why did we have to make a reservation?!?!?!? Maybe this should've been a sign for us not to eat there, but we proceeded. The waitress explained to us that the cook would be bringing out meats for us to try... Every single piece of meat that came out tasted like it had been sitting over the flame for hours, extremely dry! And on top of that extremely over seasoned, it was licking a salt stone! We did NOT eat all we could eat cause it was disgusting! Luckily Groupon refunded us... If I could give this place a negative star I would, please don't eat here...."}
{"text":"Mixed review, the salad bar was limited but bearable. The meats were good and even tasty. The service lacked speed and experience. They charge 30 bucks which is just as much as the other places but probably should be charging 20 do to the food selection and quality. I might go back if I had a coupon or something."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this place via a groupon coupon. Now this place a solid 3 stars because of what the resturant wanted me to \"think\" of their place vs what it actually is. And although the service \"did their jobs\" and the food wasnt really bad, this place didnt leave me to say Yes! I want to come back. Think of a movie that previewed itself as awesome! You watch it and thought well that sucked, i thought it was going to be better. The movie wasnt a total waste, but defiantly NOT a buyer or resee movie. Thats here. Originally we wanted to eat there another day. We wanted to come an hour before they closed, but they insisted we make a future rsvp. \"Oh\", I thought, \"must be packed!\" Ive been to my fair share of packed resturants and so I was quite excited.  Our rsvp day, we we running behind and called about 2 hours before our scheduled rsvp to move it 30 minutes later, the lady asked me to hold. You can hear her asking someone if we could move our rsvp. The conversation between them made me feel they were trying to make it work to move my rsvp. Inside my head Im thinking, \"wow this must be a VERY busy and hit hopping place! Im even more excited.\" Inside Im praying please say yes.  Now on the groupon, yes dont laugh at me. That should have been a huge HELLO, your not dealing with a hip hopping place hahaha, ok now on the coupon it stated a dress code. Again another feel of how oh la la this place must be. Im making sure we look our best. And we get there and...... ONLY one other party is there! Wtf?!?! So this resturant made me feel they were so busy that it had to be discussed on weither my 30 min rsvp change can be accomplished?!?! Two other parties showed up after us, but ultimately there was plenty I MEAN pleanty of room!  Ok so the hostess was nicely dressed, spoke fast, but got the job done.  The food.....um good. Cant knock it because really it was something my palette wasnt use to. So Im not sure if the food was bad? Or I just dont like the style? The steak was good, but it didnt have too much flavor. Which meant I needed to have some type of sauce with it, but there wasnt any to have. Like I said, I was full at the end. Pick through what I liked and left what I didnt like. Was it even worth the $70 price? Nah I wouldnt pay for that again. I would rather go to another steak house and spend $70 and be COMPLETELY happy with what I ordered.  So the staff was dressed in a cow boy outfit, weird cause well it just didnt match the restaurant. The resturant tried to be fancy, but the buffet bar just doesnt scream dress code. My fiance mention to me the service to serve your steaks is much slower here than.....crap forgot the name of the resturant he mention. He says you dont have chance to sit and get full as what this restaurant was doing between servings.  The service was plain. Not bad. They did their job. But boring. There was no personality, no nothing to even make me come back for at least the server. You know the restaurants you like just because the service was awesome. Well these guys arent it. At least today werent.  Sorry guys, but today will be the last time I come here. Just not worth paying that (even cheap) groupon price to re eat here, let alone even thinking of paying the price its \"suppose\" to be..... I RECOMMEND TO CHOOSE ANOTHER STEAK HOUSE. Ok so here the weird part. Now this part makes me think about the service again on what i just gave a 3 star for. Hmmmmm should i change it to a 2 star???? At the end of the meal the hostess charges us the tax. Our \"groupon\" meal was covered but we pay for the tax. Cool no biggy, but just a warning for people. The she puts on the ticket \"gratuity 15% just a suggestion 17.47\" something like that 17 something she was asking. Then in my head i was laughing. Now I belive in gratuities. Oh yes ! In fact my normal tipping is 20% because its easier to figure and if I really like you I throw more,  but for this? Hahahaha. Ok so on their website (a non coupon offer) in general it states $43.99 a person. Times 2 is 88, so even 15% of that is only $13.20. So how did she come up with such math. Ugh who knows?!?! Let me let these people be aware......YOU CAN EASILY GET $20 BUCKS IN TIPS IF YOU WOULD JUST HAVE PERSONALITY. AND NOT BEG FOR IT ON THE BILL."}
{"text":"Went there for Easter 2014. Horrible. My party of 3 were the only ones there at 1 pm ... when we left, only one more party arrived. Our meat was overdone and cold. Salad bar was subpar. the meats kept coming, too fast in my opinion and then, we had to go to the bar to get our bill and waited 10 minutes! Ugh. I would not recommend this place, period."}
{"text":"So horrible!! First we get there and there is no hostess for about 5 minutes.. so we peak around the corner and some women (whom I'm assuming is the owner) says she will be with us in a bit.. so we wait about 5 more minutes and let her know we have a groupon for 4.. keep in mind that it's me my husband and my 5 year old daughter.. the groupon says enjoy 7 meats of this restaurant blah blah blah so we're like okay cool.. so we see the server (whom I'm assuming is also the other owner) going table to table and then skips us my husband asks what's going on and the server chick is like oh he will be right out.. server comes and says I see you got the groupon deal (very loud I might add) and says for ten dollars more we can get more meat choice.. I figured since I got the Groupon I thought we already had that but I guess whatever we were like no that's fine.. so he has the little meats and tri tip and he says we can only choose the little ones and we're like okay but let me say most of the meats are super rare like a bloody massacre and the ones that aren't are burnt like they were little devils.. but we deal.. so we go to the salad bar and tell me why the macaroni salad and mashed potatoes taste just like the one from Albertsons.. then we realized it's only them two working!! Like seriously it's only them two so I guess that's why everything seemed just messy.. the suggested tip was 15 bucks for three of us and I would've but it was just so messy since we got there.. like no lady I know you both are trying to make a living but I feel like I've got hustled.. and there was a moment my husband seen shrimp and eyed the server and the server stuck his face up and just walked away like I told you to pay the extra ten.. I felt so horrible I should have just taken him to the one in town square.. I feel so bad because it was my husbands birthday dinner ugh never again!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  we found this place on Groupon and had a party of six. We made reservation explaining  that we had two different coupons.   when we arrived they sat us asked for the coupons and stated that they wouldn't except both,  the lady walks away to see what they would do redeemed one of our coupons and tools us that we can only use one.  Honestly I've eaten at many Brazilian Steakhouses and this is set up so cheaply.  We left and went to Fogo De Chao, please don't waste your time and take our advice for $7 more you'll definitely won't be disappointed.  STAY FAR AWAY!!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Whenever I need to feed my inner T-Rex, I love the Brazillian Steakhouse format. I've been to most around the city and enjoy their individual quirks. Bertolucci, in a word, was intimate. You didn't have to fight the masses to hold a conversation with your dinner companions; nor elbow anyone at the salad bar to get your selections. The salad bar was not as extensive nor exotic as the bigger places but everything there was fresh and complimentary to the meats. I loved the fact that my meat choices came in manageable portions; enough so, that I was able to try all the offerings that night and of course seconds of my favorites. The hot side dishes were good, especially the beef stroganoff. That nigtht, Bertolucci had grilled pineapple along with the meats  and Included with our dinner price was dessert, Brazillian flan; creamy and not overly sweet.   Service was good and spot on. As mentioned previously, the cowboy outfits were a little odd but did nothing to detract from the taste of the food, the attentiveness of our servers, or the overall pleasant dining experience. A return grub fest is definitely in order."}
{"text":"Service is 5 stars, value is 4 stars (compared to other Brazilian steakhouses, $30/person is a steal), and food is 3 stars.   The skewered meats (and grilled pineapple, yum) were all good, though the bacon wrapped chicken was a bit dry, but breast meat usually tends to be. Meat-wise, it was pretty much the same offerings as the other guys. However, I do believe their Brazilian sausages weren't fatty/greasy as others I've had.  The first fried bananas I got were soft and caramelized, absolutely perfect, but the ones I got later were not. The sole on their hot plate buffet was very tasty and moist & chicken stroganoff was especially good with the fried polenta. The cold and hot buffet offerings were limited, but I've always had issue with the ridiculous amounts offered at most of the other restaurants...because, hey, it's really all about the meat.  They were playing the musical tracks from karaoke songs as background music. Kinda cheesy.  Pretty sure there is some kind of Brazilian music that could serve as better ambiance mood music and than this. The kicker was when one of the servers (pretty sure he had to be one of the owners, or something) cranked up the volume and sang, Stand By Me. His voice was good, with volume turned up a little too loud, so it was just cheesy cute...until he sang a 2nd & 3rd one. My partner and I had to speak loudly and lean in next to each other to be able to talk. Thankfully, we were finished and leaving when he started into another one. Suggestion To Management: nix the cheesy karaoke tracks & performance(s), use a CD player, and play some real music if you don't want to turn customers off."}
{"text":"So we got a chance to go to this restaurant via a Groupon. The wait for the meats were super long and didn't offer much salad bar and only a few guys were passing out the all the meats but the meats were amazing at the least. Very crowded and squeezed tables."}
{"text":"Bought the Groupon to check out this place and thank goodness I had a Groupon.  I would have been so upset to pay full price.  To get the full meat choices we had a $10 per person upcharge.  The good news is that the meat was brought around frequently. The bad news is the meat was horrible. It was terrible quality and not flavorable.  I would not suggest trying this place even with the Groupon. The cheese on the cold bar were hard and who knows how old.  The hot bar did not have good options.  Save your money and try another Brazilian steakhouse."}
{"text":"If they have not gone out of business, they will be soon.  I called and made a reservation on 9/14 for 9/18 because i had a gift cert i needed to use.  We got there at 5:30 for our reservation and they were closed.  We ended up at Todd's Unique Dining and was so glad we did!"}
{"text":"Biggest joke and dump of a steakhouse I've ever seen.  1 man show running this bait n switch joint.  Bought groupon called same gentleman took reservation and never stated anything about $10 upcharge per person for the \"better\" meats.  I don't know what could be better.  Asked for medium well style was offered sirloin tips 3 times medium, and medium rare.  The chicken looked like it was 5 days old.  Salad bar consisted of cardboard lettuce and some dressing.  Got side dishes of cold mashed potatoes and rice.  Place was a gem. Paid $50 for 1 piece of garlic toast.  Avoid this place at all costs we walked up and left.  Once they find out you won't pay the mystery upcharge that is nowhere in the menu or posted they give 2 shits about you.  McDonald's was the better option."}
{"text":"They want to charge fogo de chao prices, for sizzler quality meats.   I love trying local businesses, because murrica. Came here under a groupon, and would still not pay what they're asking. He came around with sirloin and started cutting. I looked at the piece, he looked at the piece. All fat, but he continues cutting. The meat was chewy/rubbery.  The salad bar was at room temperature, I took a bite of the mushrooms and stopped immediately. It was a bacteria cess pool.   They advertise tri-tip, but no tri-tip. The best part of the meal was him coming around with (I shit you not) garlic bread in a skewer. The best part of the $80 was Texas toast and fucking garlic butter.   I would have been better off spending the extra $15 a person and going to fogo, with at least decent quality meats.   I'd maybe pay $15 to come back in the future."}
{"text":"Worse experience I have ever had . Food was horrible, service was bad . Says make reservations and dress code . No such thing there . Asked for Medium to medium rare everything the server brought out was so rare we could not even eat it . The so called salad bar taste like the smiths deli it was horrible . Very costly and not worth it ."}
{"text":"We went wIth a Groupon for our anniversary 11/11. Wanted Texas but it was booked. Thought we would try this one since its close to home. Salad bar was sad. Very small and food looked like it was out of cans and had been sitting out for awhile. Nothing like Texas and Via. My husband prefers meat well done, they offered to cook a little more. Meat came back just as rare. We asked for a coke, they brought a can with a glass of ice. Meat selection was limited and was ok. Got the bill, couldn't believe Coke was $3!! Prices for meal are pretty much the same as other places. We will make the trek to Via or Texas."}
{"text":"We went to dinner for my wife's birthday, what a fantastic experience. Our hostess was warm and friendly and gave us the  run down on the salads a and side dishes. The serving staff was wonderful and always seemed to be at the table with another tasty meat offering.  We had the pleasure of meeting the owner and he  even sang for my wife.  While we live in the Bay Area, we  will make this a must on our next visit.  Thanks again for the enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was clean and the atmosphere was relaxing. The guy cutting the meat came to our table so frequently and the food was out of this world. Thank you for the wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!!!  Little place with a great atmosphere. The service was outstanding never having an empty glass and always having more meet coming around. It seems to be family owned and operated and it's not to busy so they made sure to ask us if we had any special requests. The steaks were so perfect that I regretted going to the salad bar first! Highly recommend this place to anyone that enjoys their meats. Groupon was a great deal!"}
{"text":"I've never given a bad review (My Momma taught me \"If you can't say anything nice , don't say anything at all\"), I have to break my Momma's rule on this one ! HORRRAAABBBLE !! Awful ! Yuck , yuck, double yuck ! Pick a different Brazillion , this place us Soooo not worth your money or time ! Ok,, there,, now I've gotten it off my chest ,, back to being a nice Indiana Girl"}
{"text":"Took my family and meat selection was fantastic. The owner and his wife were very warm and accompanying ! Will definitely got back !!!!"}
{"text":"The Groupon brought me to Bertolucci. The other bad reviews are completely accurate, unfortunately. Understaffed. Spotty service. Room temperature salad bar. Empty pan of dried up mashed potatoes on hot bar. Overcooked meat. Very disappointing. Spend the extra money, go to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at another Brazilian eatery so I have the honor of giving an unbiased & honest opinion (not based off 'comparing' this place to other 'fancier' locations.... It isn't a dang competition folks. You do know it's ok to like more than one eatery!).   Been here twice now.  Me and my fiancé LOVED the food!  We particularly love the sausage & filet!  More seafood selection would be nice but I'm not complaining.   We will definitely return even without a Groupon."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere and great churrascaria!  The owner, Humberto, is hilarious and awesome. We had a great time. This is one of the few Brazilian churrascarias in Las Vegas worth coming back to. It is authentic and delicious!  They are VERY good at getting their meats just right. I absolutely love their picanha! They make it better than Fogo de Chão and Texas de Brazil, hands down! Very happy with the taste and cut of all their meats!"}
{"text":"So we saw this place while out shopping one day. I later saw it on Groupon and figured  we'd give it a shot. It was mediocre at best. I feel Texas De Brazil and Fugo De Chao are far superior. Some of the cuts of meat were delicious,  others were chewy and overdone. The buffet bar was lacking. Our  soft drinks were served in a can, which I found slightly tasteless considering it's a steakhouse, not a food truck. Thankfully we had the Groupon. I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon and decided to try this place. All Brazilian steak houses are a little pricey, but even if you didn't have a Groupon, this place isn't outrageously priced. Now let's get down to the food. A very extensive salad and sides bar with everything including beans, rice, salad, light desserts and many many more items. The steaks, chicken, sausages and pith are served at a perfect temperature, incredibly seasoned and cooked to perfection. A nice variety of wine and beer, this place is well worth the stop. I am very sure you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I'm giving Bertolucci four stars for one reason only:  I want it to succeed because it would then be my closest and least expensive Brazilian Steakhouse.  In all reality it probably deserves somewhere South of three stars...but, the mitigating circumstances I mention above plus the fact they had a very friendly and attentive staff are compelling me to rate it higher.  I purchased a Groupon ($50) on a Wednesday and reserved a 6:30p seat on the same day.  I was a little worried when we arrived to find the parking lot empty and only one other table with guests during this prime dinner hour.  By the end of our meal at 7:30p there were about five tables occupied.  Now it does not take a lot of calculating to figure that a place like this HAS to be busy to be good...or they'd be wasting a ton of meat.  The alternative would be to be willing to lose a million dollars the first year of operation so that you can build a customer base and garner a reputation that will pay dividends over time.  This is not what is going on.  And I think even if they were able to do this...it might not work because of the supremely bad location.  It's not that it is in a bad area...just a no-man's land there at the end of Green Valley Pkwy.  I remember thinking the same thing when the former Italian restaurant was there...and how they explained that no pizza was available today because they did not turn the oven on...then BK a couple of months later.  The meat that we did get was quite delicious and their cheesebread was excellent.  The salad bar was very minimal in selection, but fine in quality.  I guess the bottom line is would I go here again, and while I might say yes, I don't think I could talk my wife into it...and she's probably right.  Knowing that I'd have to drive an extra 10 miles and pay $20 per-person more to go to Texas de Brazil would not even slow us down...because the value is there.  Maybe in the future if we drive by and see that it's doing some business (while we eat at the most excellent Elixir across the street) we'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas with a friend and found this place via Groupon. My first Brazilian steak house, and myself and my companion both really enjoyed our dinner. If I lived here I'd definitely go back more often. The people were very friendly and the food was very good as well! The meats were all cooked just right and delicious as well. I had no complaints.. My companion did however point out to me that our server did not know the brand (pitu) Cachaca used in the caipirinha... Otherwise though 5 stars. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bought the Groupon deal and now understand why they have the Groupon. The salad bar had empty plates and no one was refilling. The items on there were cold cut and pickles. Nothing looked appetizing, soup pot was placed on a table next to salad bar. We drank ice teas instead of the wine the coupon came with but was charged for two ice teas, service taxes, groupon fee?? After buying the coupon and paying for all the fees ($90) it should have gone the Fogo or Texas de Brazil.   All the people that gave this place a low rating, well they're true."}
{"text":"Paid a visit only because they had yelp coupon. Per person price was over $40.  Place had very minimal food selection for being Brazilian bbq.  Great bar selection,   in short, over priced Brazilian bar.  Nice staff though."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. After being seated, we were asked for our drink order. I asked if they had my favorite vodka. No, they didn't but they had a reasonable substitute. The waiter then runs off without asking how I wanted my drink. I had to chase him down and tell him. He then returns to our table and informs us that we have to pay an extra $10 per person for the expanded menu. I tell him I'd like to discuss this with my wife. His answer? \"No. I need to know right now.\" That should have been the first clue. 20/20 hindsight, we should have bolted then.  The drinks arrive. Mine is so weak, I'm not convinced he put any vodka in it. There is also a few anemic ice cubes floating on the top. I ask for a lime, he takes my drink from the table and returns with a brown lime down in the glass. Nice. The \"buffet\" is pitiful. The dishes are all covered, and with nowhere to set your plate to uncover and serve yourself, it took teamwork between my wife and I to serve ourselves. The \"salad bar\" is lettuce, cherry tomatoes and artichoke hearts for the most part. I wasn't going to risk the potato salad or Cole slaw.  With a plate of \"buffet\" items we have no room to put the meat, so I head back and get a couple of plates for the meats.  The meats were overdone, fatty but plentiful. The poor kid who was cutting and serving the meat was working his butt off and was surprised when we asked for the check after just a few minutes.  Not worth the Groupon price, even. Thank goodness I had it because if I had paid full price for that I would have exploded.   It's no small feat for my wife and I to get out alone to a dinner and a few drinks. Our night was ruined from the first snotty demand out of the waiters mouth.   Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had. The meat was over done and dry. We were not given a choice of how it was cooked. It all  tasted the same. Very bland. They didn't bring any chicken around at all. Very over priced for what little we got. Save yourself the trouble if you want Brazilian go to Texas De Brazil worth the few extra dollars if not almost the same price as this stuff was. Soda 3 dollars a can. Automatic gratuity and we had to wait on everything. Salad bar and hot bar was a joke to... Not to mention my houses stomach was not happy all night!!! DO NOT GO EAT HERE. what a rip off.. You upsize a package and didn't even get meat you got little pieces of bark and chewy crap with grissle and fats... Shrimp so dry you couldn't chew it..."}
{"text":"Found this place on restaurant.com. If you still didn't try this place you should go there ASAP. There is nowhere in Vegas that will serve you more meat that is so delicious and the value is amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced for the quality of food/service. My wife and I went there last night with another couple. We paid $100 for 4 people on a groupon. After paying a $10/person \"upgrade\" for additional meat (filet mignon and shrimp), $10/person for drinks, mandatory 18% gratuity our total bill was $250...   The quality of the salad bar was poor, with everything under plastic lids. I don't really know how to describe the salad bar items except to say, think deli counter at your local discount supermarket... not high quality.  The meat was overcooked and they only brought out the \"upgrades\" once. My shrimp was so overcooked it was dry and flaky. I ended up not eating any of it because i couldn't peel the shell off...  In short, go to Texas de Brazil. At the end of the meal its the same price for exponentially better food."}
{"text":"We went to Bertolucci's 2/13/2016 with a Living Social deal we received as a gift.  We were seated promptly when we arrived at our reservation time.  The restaurant was nothing fancy but was pleasant.  The employees were also pleasant.  We both enjoyed the salad bar.  For a small salad bar, they had a good variety of fresh items.  Everything we tried was delicious.  The hot meal bar was less than stellar.  The chicken stroganoff and the chicken cacciatore were awful, as were the mashed potatoes.  The fried bananas were delicious though.  Everything else looked about as appetizing as the chicken entrees, so we didn't try anything else.  The meats were seasoned well and were cooked just right, but everything we ate was chewy.  I know people who go to other Brazilian steakhouses and gush about how the meat melts in your mouth, but not this place.  Not a tender piece of beef in the place.  The pork rib, however, was good as were the sausages, but I wouldn't go back because of the tough beef.  We also were charged taxes and a gratuity, but we paid the taxes and left what we felt was appropriate for the gratuity.    I would never go back there."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous. I love Brazilian steakhouses but don't love the price tag that usually comes along with them. There are two other great places in town but they are around $50 a plate.   This place was around $30 a plate and just as delicious!!   The environment was romantic and cozy and I noticed there was a karaoke area, though no one used it while we were there. The service was great too, the servers were attentive and friendly.   I hope this place is around for a long time because it's my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GIVE YOUR BUSINESS TO THESE SCUMBAGS!! My boyfriend tried to make a reservation after surcharging a Groupon and they asked for the voucher number just to make the reservation. He told them he wasn't comfortable with that since they can redeem the voucher if they have the number. It's also listed on the Groupon AND their website that the coupon must be shown when you get there. The owner told us to go f*** ourselves and hung up on us. Groupon has canceled the coupon and refunded us and we'll tell everyone we know about this!"}
{"text":"My room mate got a group on for 4 to this place. Me her and my 2 best friends went there yesterday, after reading the reviews and were more then a little worried, BUT once there, our minds were put at ease.  I've ate at many many fine dinning restaurants, and yes I've had better food... but this place was great, we saved money compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses, the server was awesome. He joked and made us feel like it was his goal in making sure we got the food cooked perfectly.. Instead of the typical here is a piece of meat, want it or not.. Everything the 4 of us tasted was great.. Seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly to medium rare... And special well done for my room mate..   They brought out the bottle of wine after giving us a decent choice, all the drinks we ordered, and kept our water glass full. We were never rushed, everyone always had a smile.  The Salad bar was decent.. I see some reviews that sound like they are expecting the buffet at Caesar's, this salad bar had more then enough for me, and everything was tasty..  Over all this place was worth it.. The food was great and enjoying dinner with friends is priceless.. I wouldn't have any issue at all going back"}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Brazilian Steakhouses at least 40 times in the last 5 years.  We love them and are always excited to try new ones. We visited Vegas this week and bought a Groupon for Bertolucci Brazilian Steakhouse and took two friends who live locally.  We were so disappointed in the restaurant, the meat and the (lack of) salad bar. The place is dirty. The meat is flavorless and the salad bar is a joke. It's nothing like the pictures posted on Yelp by viewers from 3 years ago. The salad bar is dinky and hardly has any selection. They have a very limited meat menu. Nothing like the other steakhouses we've been too. They only offered 7 meats for dinner. And they served soda in a can for $3.00. Not even a fountain soda.  They didn't serve the cheese bread at the tables like ALL other Brazilian Steakhouses we've been to. The owners, a husband and wife, were the only workers.  The wife was the hostess and the husband served the steak. They were both really nice and friendly, but the quality of their food will never take me back. Don't waste your time or money there. Just go to Fogo de Chaos or Texas de Brazil if you're looking for amazing Brazilian Steakhouse food. You won't be disappointed there."}
{"text":"Recieved a flyer on our door for this restaurant and decided to give it a try for breakfast. It was fantastic!  The bacon is the best I believe I have ever had. Prices are very good and the service is very good.  We are looking forward to coming back to try the Brazilian steak dinner!  It's a little off the beaten path but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"One word - AWFUL!  I bought a groupon for the restaurant thinking it was a great deal.  I would have much rather donated that money to a homeless person.  First off the place was tiny, maybe 10 tables or so, that should've tipped me off.  The salad bar was awful, everything looked dry or wilted - I've seen better salad bars at $4.99 buffet. Most of the salad trays were empty and we had to ask for them to fill them.  I asked for fried bananas bc it was empty.  The cook refilled it with 3 slices.  SMH.  The same 6 meats kept coming around (and yes I can name them!!!).  When we asked how many kinds of meats they were serving, the only answer they could give was \"a lot\".  We counted - it was a total of 6, for almost 2 hours the same 6 kept coming around.  When we asked for sodas the woman who waited on our table did not speak English and just kept filling up the water - we asked for soda several times until they finally brought us our cans.  Do yourself a favor and go to In and Out and pocket the other $60 you save!  You'll be much more satisfied than eating here!  Wish I could get my money back.  Such a poor excuse for a Brazilian churrascaria - If anyone thinks this restaurant is even worth coming to, they obviously have never eaten at a real quality, top notch Brazilian bbq.  So disappointed and would never recommend it!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was a little nervous after reading all of the negative reviews. I decided to give it a shot. My family of 4 went to celebrate a birthday. I didn't tell them any of the negative because I wanted their honest reaction since I'm the only  one of the four of us who's not such a meat lover.  Between the four of us, we tried every meat that was brought to our table. The only disappointment (only for me) was that we were never served filet mignon. Every meat brought to the table was consumed by one of us. Not a scrape left on anyone's plate. The seasoning was perfect. My kids even tried the lamb! We went on a Thursday at 6:30PM so the place was never full but they kept a steady stream of meat coming out. The adults were done and full long before the kids. The entire staff was SOOO friendly!  I had purchased a living social offer so I feel the value was decent. We were celebrating a birthday so this was a splurge for us. The \"salad\" bar is not that big but my boyfriend loved the antipasto portion. I happen to love Barefoot wine so I was very satisfied with our bottle of Moscato. For a special occasion and with another special offer, I would definitely consider returning here."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon deal advertised for $68 for two people all you can eat Brazilian Steak House worth $115, what I received was sub-par in so many ways. I started with salad and such only to find the imitation crab meat was \"jerky\" style and the only thing drier was the cheese cubes. The salad bar had some offerings but nothing worth the Groupon cost not to mention the actual cost.   The meat selection was limited and quite frankly, not too bad, they would have received two stars if I wasn't so upset.   On the bright side, the staff was friendly and for the most part, attentive. I tipped $15 and spent a very disheartening 30 minutes there.   Shame on Fago De Chao for setting the bar so high!"}
{"text":"My first time there.  The greeter told us we were suppose to have a reservation even though there was only one other couple in the place at 6:30. The salad bar was ok.  There was some good things.  The meat coming over was scetchy. The tritip tasted old but the sirloin was good. My bacon wrapped chicken was over cooked, basically charcoal. I am glad I had a Groupon. I would have hated to pay full price."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for a dinner for two, included salad bar, house wine and desert.   Wine was excellent, all you can eat meat was also very good, in size and taste and desert, flan was great. Service was friendly and attentive.   Reason for the 4 stars was the salad bar and the curb appeal. Location is in an ugly mini strip mall, not horrible but not great.  Salad bar looked as if it was prepared very early in the day and left in place uncovered for hours.   Overall nice family run place, they should nix the salad bar."}
{"text":"All the reviewers that rated this place low I completely agree. The only reason why I gave 2 stars is because the waiter we had was nice and did not in fact write down a tip for us. And this patricia s., isn't helping at all by cussing at customers reviews. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Not sure what these positive reviews were paid for posting these 4 and 5 star reviews...   I bought a groupon for this place and decided why not. I called ahead to see if a reservation was needed. I was told that it most definitely was or I couldn't eat there tonight. I get there and my car was the only one in the parking lot I almost left because I thought it was closed. So I called from the parking lot to see if it were open. The guy said yes we're jam packed come down! Lol.  So I go in no hostess went almost into the kitchen to get someone to seat me. Sat and went to the salad bar. Salad bar sucked. Old cheese veggies hams and heated canned soups to eat. The meat was reheated by microwave I could tell in the taste and how soggy the meat was. So I receive the check after a bad meal one refill and bad service and they wrote down how much tip they deserved per total of the check not including groupon deal which was about 33$ lol  I'm usually really optimistic I give restaurants a solid chance and hate giving bad reviews. But this place definitely deserves it. Someone needs to put this restaurant on a restaurant rescue reality show or something lol. Paid only 10$ less than I would have at Texas de Brazil or fogo. Pay the extra money and enjoy the service and better food. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Disappointing dinner. I should have read all these reviews before going. Like others have mentioned, the parking lot was empty. We seemed to be the first there. We had a restaurant.com coupon which reduced the price by $25. Even at that price we will not return. I noticed that everyone else that dined also had a coupon of some sort.   Salad bar is minimal. Lettuce, salad dressing, some deli ham and cheese, tuna salad (or chicken?)  type of stuff.   Meats ranged from okay to really bad. The chicken breast and lamb might have been spoiled. What they are calling filet mignon is not. The texture wasn't right at all. Meat was slow to come out.   I would have rather paid more and gone to Texas de Brazil. This was like the Hometown Buffet version of Brazilian BBQ.   I find it odd that the reviews for this restaurant seem to be really good or really bad. I can't help but wonder about the difference. Either there is a totally different experience on different nights, or someone is trying to manipulate the reviews."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I would give it a 4.5 if possible. I came here while on my honeymoon, and was thrilled with the experience.   My husband and I arrived at 5, and had the restaurant to ourselves. The young man who seated us was friendly and pleasant. He even took us to the hot plate part of the buffet to explain what each dish was, which made us even more excited to try everything.   I have been to a Tocano's before. Compared to Tocano's, this place /does/ have a small buffet, but I actually really liked that. It was less intimidating. They have a small buffet with delicious dishes that are a great accent to the meats they bring to the table. There are fewer meat choices than at Tocano's, but I was ok with that - I don't like fish, anyway.   The meat was delicious. The only one we weren't crazy about was the bacon-wrapped chicken. And it was good, just not as good as everything else was.   Stop everything else, and automatically ask for seconds of the garlic bread. I could have eaten it all night and nothing else! And the grilled pineapple was incredible.   The three staff members we had contact with were friendly and professional, and just made the entire experience wonderful.   We were able to use a restaurant.com coupon with ZERO issue.   I would come back here in an instant, and would happily recommend it to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"From the start, you call in for a 7:30pm reservation and no one acknowledges you until 7:45, and you don't get seated until 8pm.    Then they tell you the $50 groupon only covers half of the meats and you must pay another $20 to get the filet mignon and other meats seems deceptive.  But we go ahead and pay for it.  Then you get to the buffet bar (if you could even call it that), and they have no rice, no mashed potatoes, and by the time the meats actually get to you, you've already finished your buffet plate.    There were several meats that were so overcooked I had to spit it out.  It's bad when your 7-year old says the top sirloin is too chewy.  Oh and getting charged $21 when my 7-year old eats one plate and says his stomach hurts after eating from the buffet.  To top everything off, the owner comes by saying he wants to please one table of obviously drinking customers and do we mind if they put on music BUT starts doing horrible karaoke, I'm done.    You would do better to pay the same money at the end at Texas De Brazil or even the Brazillian place in Planet Hollywood.  If I could leave a penny for tip, I would have (Groupon says you have to leave 18% top).  Groupon needs to really go to these establishments before representing that was a deal"}
{"text":"Save your money and don't go here. My boyfriend and I made a (mandatory) reservation at 6 o'clock and got there a little early. The doors were locked and the lobby lights were dark. We were greeted and sat at 6. Apparently they don't open at 5 like the website says. The soups at the buffet looked old as if they were microwaved from the night before and the salad didn't look very fresh either. Steaks came out fast but everything was over cooed and burnt, even when asked how we liked our Steaks cooked. The last meat to come was the filet which was hands down the best but when we asked for more I saw the owner yelling at the meat guy after giving us 3 additional pieces. We did purchase a Groupon and it advertised dessert for 2. When we were finished with our meal we were expecting to have the dessert suggested to us but instead we received a bill for our soda. I asked about the dessert and she said it was the fruit at the buffet. And when I looked at the bill we were charged  $12 for 2 12 ounce cans of sprite. Keep in mind we asked for iced tea and she said it was no good. What?! So I'm being charged an insane amount for something I really didn't even want. It was safer than drinking the water that tasted like it was straight from Lake mead. I'm an advocate for family owned and operated restaurants but I also work hard for my money and would have been more satisfied and treated better at Texas de brazil  (which is 5 miles down the road).  I read reviews on yelp all the time and when I read the previous ones from this particular restaurant I didn't expect it to be as horrible as read but no one is exaggerating when it comes to this steak house."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon dinner for 4, after we finished our meal, they gave os the bill, they charge the taxes of the regular prices, plus the 18%  of the total price plus the taxes!!!!!! We where Robbed!!!! The bread was amazing by the way!"}
{"text":"Tried to use our Groupon before it expired this past Friday night at 8:30pm. The restaurant was practically empty with only a few tables occupied. We walked in and were asked if we had reservations. We replied no and were turned away. Surprised they would turn away business in a half empty restaurant. We'll never be back."}
{"text":"Awesome service great food definitely definitely get the top sirloin and just tell them to stay at your table because it is awesome... And because I said so."}
{"text":"Great hostess, servers, food, and overall environment. My boyfriend and I visited Bertolucci's tonight and we're very impressed. We love it!   Will definitely visit again in the future. Thank you to our hostess and to Berto for taking care of us! Great early Valentines dinner!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, small location. Staff is kept to a minimum intentionally and the owner personally serves you and constantly checks on your wellbeing. I will absolutely come back here for the owner alone, his personality is a true rarity when it comes to service. The food was also incredible and the only change I would make is to displaying the salads/side dishes."}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding where I wanted to have my birthday dinner and I wanted to try a new place. I'm happy I did! The food was delicious and the staff was amazing!   The meats were cooked perfectly and the salad bar was good as well. The mashed potatoes were soo yummy!   They have karaoke which my whole family enjoyed! They enjoyed it more than I thought.  The restaurant is family owned so the owners actually care and take their time to get to know you.   The price was great! It's better than paying $50 per person. Especially if your family is pretty big.  Thank you guys for making my birthday unforgettable! My family and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Got a groupon for this place. I would say it is worth the groupon price but not full $. Don't get the idea this is an high dollar or fancy establishment. It is a neighborhood place that is casual at best. People were nice. Salad bar was weak meats were good. Don't set your expectations high and you will be ok."}
{"text":"Oh this place, so many things... I don't usually write reviews if they're not good but I'm hoping my comments will help this place because it has potential.  I bought a coupon on restaurant.com about a month ago and planned to use it on Valentine's Day. I called to make a reservation and they let me no that they won't be accepting coupons on Valentines so I made it for the Friday night before, which was fine.  We arrived at 7:30 and waited quite a while to be seated or even greeted for that matter. The owner finally came over and seated us. She asked for our coupon right away.  Explained how it worked and took our drink order, no iced tea, no Pinot Grigio, weird. My husband ordered a coke (came in a can). We went to salad bar and.. Nope, very few things looked appetizing. The stroganoff was very good and some stew stuff was good too but everything was mislabeled. Meat served very well but all way to rare for me. Garlic bread was to die for and juiciest pineapple ever! Overall just not impressed. Never got drink refills and when we left I saw Pinot Grigio bottles in the wine case. Displays? Who knows? Won't go back til I start seeing better reviews. Overpriced. Owners, take people's advice, don't criticize. I think most people would like to see you succeed."}
{"text":"Ummm just ok by food and setup but service was fabulous and there was no waite and yes the karaoke was fun to watch ... Not sure if I'll be back but I won't say never"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went there with a Grupon at 5pm Friday night. Their service was very good, and the dining room was clean and organized. The owners were there and they were very attentive with us. The food was good for the price. Their drinks, including caipirinhas, were pretty good :)  We had a great time and the Groupon was definitely worth it. Don't bother about the haters who wrote bad reviews, there are a lot of trolls out there.  Tip to the owners, keep your meat fresh and never freeze it; weloved your restaurant and we will be coming back soon. Thank you!!!  Great place to enjoy an authentic Brazilian BBQ."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for there. Went there a couple weeks ago. Tried everything of course. It was ok until we bit into the chicken. I noticed the chewy texture and spit it out. What I saw was RAW CHICKEN!!! Complained to the chef and he told me it's cooked for 2 hours and it's fine to eat. Seriously, I even showed it to him and he said it was a Brazilian style of chicken!!! Is he an idiot?!? It's dark pink and barely cooked! My girlfriend got food poisoning. Then there was a hair on my dessert. Complained and decided I was done eating there. They never took it off my bill until I said something about it. I'd rather pay full price for a good Brazilian Steakhouse than to ever go there again!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! Service is excellent, the owners are friendly, accommodating and anxious to please! Food is good....have to go easy on the salad bar so there's room for all the delicious meats! A very cozy locals place that's great value as well!"}
{"text":"Not worth the time or money. We used a living social deal and still found the quality lacking to the point where we wished we hadn't purchased. The \"Beef Stroganoff\" was the only decent dish and the Servers were super friendly. Also be aware that gratuity is automatically included and exceeds15% or 18% if I remember correctly based on the ACTUAL VALUE not the deal price.  Take your business down to Texas De Brazil"}
{"text":"Clientele used to eating at reputable Brazilian Steakhouses - BEWARE.  We the found their deal on Groupon. When we arrived, the meat skewers were still on the grill, so we had to wait at least 30 minutes for their wait staff to start bringing out the skewers. So we had to settle for filling our bellies with the sub-par salad bar. Once the cuts were brought out, they were nothing to write home about.  And then to add insult to injury, we were hit with taxes and an automatic gratuity for parties of 4 and over (even though their service was terrible).  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"If you have ever been to a real brazillian steakhouse, this place is sure to disappoint. The food is served almost cafeteria style, cold, not very fresh. The cuts of meat are cheap cuts, and were overcooked. They lacked variety.  For the quality of food and service this venue was very over priced. Do not waste your money here . Please go to Texas da Brazil or another Brazilian steakhouse instead. Steer clear of this place! Seriously went on a date night and could have cried I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible! Not even worth on Groupon.  The meat is the lowest grade known to men!  Salad bar is poor. Caipirinha was expensive and aweful!  Spend your dollar at Texas de Brazil which will be much better investment."}
{"text":"This was our 1st experience at this place. We were warmly greeted  by the staff and the atmosphere was very inviting. The salad bar and hot dishes were pretty good. The meat came quickly and was plentiful. We will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Fantastic people! Loved it! Very personal, very attentive! Garlic sirloin...amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars. The Boyfriend & I decided to randomly try a new place (his idea) and I know he loves Brazilian steakhouses... So I steered us toward this place. At first we weren't sure what to think.. The place looks empty when you walk in, but actually almost every table had people. It took a little bit to get a table, but obviously they were busy. She sat us at a booth, which was perfect for us. The salad bar is significantly smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but the Stroganoff is out of this world. Best I've ever had! The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other. I didn't try them so I have no idea.  They started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out.  So much personality. Later we realized he was the owner.   The Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers, but obviously the red meats were the standouts. No one gave us tongs, so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server, but they worked it out.   The meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses, but I do think they could do with some sharper knives. Meat quality is good, not great but definitely good.   This place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that. For me personally, eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience. Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing. Normally that's not really my thing, but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun. When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around. It was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I'm totally shocked by all the negative reviews. This place was delicious! We had a 6:30 reservation but got there early at 5:45 and they seated us anyway. The service was excellent. My water was always refilled! We used the groupon, which was a great deal as it covered wine, dinner and flan for dessert. We even ordered extra dessert (chocolate mousse cake and the Nutella cheesecake) both were absolutely amazing. The meat was delicious and cooked to perfection. My favorite part was their garlic bread. Served in huge portions on skewers and it was amazing.  I am honestly surprised that people had a negative experience as ours was so wonderful. I would tell anyone to give it a shot, and I know my husband and I will be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what rating to give this place.  We had a 5pm reservation on Saturday and showed up right when they opened.  From the outside, you can see that the old restaurant sign was painted over poorly. This already put a bad taste in my mouth because it looks like they are too cheap to get better signage.  There was also cracks in the stucco.   Walked inside and was immediately greeted by the hostess (co-owner). She walked us to a table and explained that we serve ourselves with the salad and then the meats will be brought over to our table shortly.  The salad bar, in my opinion was unacceptable. There was not much to chose from and even the tomatoes were not ripe. I didn't even see mashed potatoes. Compared to Fogo de Chao, this salad bar is a 1 and they are a 10.   A few minutes later, a guy dressed in a cowboy outfit, brought over garlic bread on a skewer for us.  The bread was delicious. Soon after that the meats started to come.  I thought the meat was delicious.  My wife asked for meat well done and he said that he will cook it longer for her.  However, she waited a long time for him to bring back out the longer cooked meat.  I asked him several times how much meat will he bring out that we haven't seen yet and the guy didn't understand me.  I was surprised that the lights in the restaurant were off.  Due to health code laws, all lights have to be on in a place that serves food. If the health department would inspect this place, they would be hit.  I understand that the restaurant is trying to save money on electric but lights have to be lit.    Finally when we got our bill, we were charged the tax on the Groupon that we used plus try were trying to charge us a ridiculous gratuity.  I didn't give the suggested gratuity amount but something less.  I would return to place on the taste of the meats but I don't like eating at a place that appears cheap from the signage, no lighting, and the inflated gratuity charges.  I don't know if I would return here or pay the extra money and go to Fogo de Chao where is a consistent perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"I purchased a Dinner for Two on Groupon with two glasses of wine, and had reservations for 7pm on a Saturday night.  On the Groupon, it specifically said that we would have to make reservations, so I don't know why everyone is complaining about that. The hostess was very nice when we came in and made us feel comfortable.  The table was clean, but the ambiance of the restaurant could really use some work.  The salad bar was pretty pathetic, but they had some really good sides in the hot food section.  I can see how some people were completely turned off by the salad bar/hot foods area because it was super ghetto, but at least the hot food was good.  Once we served ourselves some appetizers, we sat down and started eating.  Within five minutes, we had the waiter at our table with a skewer full of bacon-wrapped chicken.  The food kept coming and we ate until we were beyond stuffed.  My favorite of the night was the garlic sirloin, which was the house special of the night.  Overall, my boyfriend and I had a great experience.  Yes, there were aspects of the dining experience that were under par, but I do believe the taste and quality of the meat made up for it.  The service was fantastic as well.  Had a great time."}
{"text":"My son wanted steak for his 16th birthday, so I bought a Groupon on my account, husband bought a Groupon from his account, and when we arrived with our party of 8, we were told we could not use both Groupons. We explained they were from different accounts and asked for our party to be split into 2 tables. Nope, they refused to do it. We explained to the waiter that the only reason we purchased the Groupons was so that we could bring our son and his friends, otherwise, we never would even considered it, as we live very far from Bertoluccis. The waiter was adamant that if we were to stay and eat there, we could only use 1 Groupon (good for 4 people) and would have to pay full price for the other 4. Had it not been for the couple seated directly behind us, obviously trying to have a romantic meal, we would have made a bigger issue out of it. Imagine that though...the ENTIRE restaurant was completely empty on a Saturday evening, and the waiter chose to cram a group of teenagers in at a table right next to a couple trying to have a quiet meal. Totally inconsiderate on their part. I've been a waitress in the past, I never would have done that to customers. Seeing how this place is obviously hurting for money and customers, you'd think they would have been happy to accomadate us by putting us at 2 tables and honoring both Groupons. Again, something I would have done when I was a waitress... anyways, without making a further scene, we decided to leave and take our son and his friends to Outback Steakhouse. Groupon is EXCELLENT with their customer service. If you are reading this review BEFORE you redeem your voucher, please know that Groupon will either refund your money, give you Groupon bucks, or a give you trade in value for your voucher. I highly suggest you save yourself the headache of trying to eating here. According to the dozens of other reviews I've read about this restaurant, it seems like the mandatory gratuity is a ripoff, and that you're eating at risk of acquiring some lovely food poisoning. In any case, Groupon has been amazing at taking care of my reimbursement, and Outback Steakhouse was the perfect back up choice. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Just don't go. That would be my only recommendation. Nothing about this restaurant is appealing. The men's bathroom was disgusting. The toilet was full with someone's bowel movement.  One of the TV's was playing StreetzTV, which evidently plays hardcore rap videos that show gratuitous twerking. Not exactly a family friendly atmosphere.   The food was terrible. Steak every single cut was awful. The only thing that was good was the garlic bread. Even the iced tea tasted awful."}
{"text":"The worst experience we have had with Groupon  very poor is a nice way to say terrible. The food was poor. The service was poorer  the value was poorest. We would not go back nor refer."}
{"text":"First of all and most importantly, the meat is great and it comes often and plentiful and you will get full fast. That being said, I have no idea why these guys did the groupon, they don't want to do groupons. This is a little more expensive, but there is some great value as well, just don't buy a soda ;)"}
{"text":"The host didn't tell me the cost, the food was not that good.  Then charged me way too much for the drinks.  Was not happy the way that the so call waitress took care of us."}
{"text":"The owner, wait staff and matradee were professional and pleasant. Our first serving of steak was rare, but we quickly got a perfect cut moments later. The flavors were delicious and satisfying off the grill. The complimentary buffet of salads, marinated mushroom, olives, artichokes, etc. was a hit in my opinion. I had my heart set on trying the bacon wrapped chicken, but it never came...maybe next time. I would go again."}
{"text":"Let's just say this was a very odd experience.  We had the Groupon and made reservations for 6 PM on a weekend.  Oddly enough, the place was almost entirely empty.  Only one other table of 2 was there, and even while we were there only one other group (of 4) came in.  As others have mentioned there is a karaoke machine set up playing music which is a bit strange.  That said, the place is clean and has a nice ambiance.    We were quickly seated and given our glasses of wine (part of the Groupon deal).  Fortunately one of the options was moscato which is my wife's favorite.  I think the only people working at the restaurant were the host and the chef.  The hot bar & salad bar were OK.  I'm not a salad person but my wife liked the pasta salad.  I liked the rice and meat & potatoes dish.  The mashed potatoes were not good and very watered down and my wife said the chicken marsala was not that great, mainly because it used dark meat.  Each time we were served it was just the chef (Bertolucci) serving the couple of tables, then going back to cook some more.  At the start we were served garlic bread which was one of the highlights of the meal -- very very good.  Following this the chef asked how we'd like our meats prepared and tried to accommodate us.  The various meats that came were sometimes spaced out a bit too much, and often times featured too much of one thing or another.  For instance we got sirloin and bacon-wrapped pork at the start and that was good.  He continued bringing out sirloin and sausage another 3 or 4 times, though.  Tri-tip showed up twice.  We only saw picanha once, and it was way too undercooked for our liking.  Likewise, garlic bread never showed up again, and the grilled pineapple that people raved about (my wife really did enjoy it) showed up only as we were getting up to leave.  The \"marinated chicken\" was probably one of the worst things I've ever eaten.  The texture was all wrong -- almost as if whatever marinade broke down half the fibers in the chicken.  I really can't describe it except to say it was just abhorrent.  I noted that one diner asked about lamb and they said they didn't have any that evening.  Checking their website later I'll note that a lot of what they say they serve there, they actually don't.  We never saw picanha, filet mignon, flank steak, pork tenderloin, bacon-wrapped chicken, or the lamb.  On the hot bar we didn't see filet mignon tips or stuffed roast beef.  I'll also note that their website has all this fine print at the bottom that should be really obvious (e.g. we charge sales tax) but it seems as if it's there because maybe most of their business is through Groupon.  Lastly, if you go read some old reviews on Yelp you will see that a couple of years ago the owner went pretty much insane on everyone who left a negative review.  A pretty big turnoff.  The Groupon was $69 and there was an additional deal on Groupon for $20 off, so we paid $49 (plus tax at the restaurant) and even with that additional discount I still think it was only an average deal.  If you go without a deal you're going to pay something like $44 per person which is ridiculous considering you can go to Texas de Brazil for a similar price and much better quality food/service."}
{"text":"Came hungry...left hungry!!!  Not comparable to other Brazilian steakhouses and that isn't a complement.  Meats are good but they are limited as are the side items...I pretty much just ate the mashed potatoes.  Spend the extra and go to another place!!"}
{"text":"The grilled pineapple and the sausages were great. Nice and friendly staffs make the experience quite fun and enjoyable. I totally meat out for the week."}
{"text":"The service at this establishment was fairly good.  This is a late review, but my wife & I ate here on the evening of the 4th of July this year.   I remember them having a talented gentleman singing as we ate our meal.  There weren't alot of people their on the 4th, but the atmosphere was very romantic.  The salad / buffet bar area has room for improvement as it's relatively small & limited compared to other Brazilian steakhouses that I've eaten at."}
{"text":"Waiter was hot, we wanted his meat if you know what I mean. Everything else was just alright. Best have a coupon as it's not worth the full price. Some of the meat came out almost raw. All the staff including the lady were extremely nice and friendly. Would only go back if we could take the waiter home with us."}
{"text":"The only reason we tried this place is because I bought a groupon (without checking yelp first let me add) but regardless, I didn't want it to go to waste so we stopped in. We called for a 6:30pm reservation only because the groupon said we needed one only to be told they couldn't accommodate us until 7pm. That's fine but we got there at 6:50pm and there were 3 tables hmm...  Anyways, onto the food, the salad bar seemed that of a banquet or like someone's graduation party like it's been sitting out all day. I didn't think it was horrible though.   The meat wasn't anywhere near on par with the likes of Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil and it wasn't awful but it wasn't good either. My boyfriend absolutely hated it though and he's a steak dude.   Also, fried bananas were literally just that, fried in breading. They tasted like a mozzarella stick with a banana inside. Just weird.   Our waiter was really nice though!  But he also added, like literally wrote in a \"suggested tip\" price. I work in the service industry and tip 20% always but this was just funny to me. I would NEVER write this on a guests check.   Unfortunate because the decor and set up of the restaurant is kind of nice but needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"It was 8am when I started looking for the perfect Brazilian restaurant to watch my World Cup game, Brazil vs Colombia , I was running out of time!! Then I get a phone call at 8:49am from Patricia ( the owner) wow! I thought they really care!!! So I reserved a table for 2 and had the best time in my life!!! I left at 10pm omg!!! I had fun!! The steaks were perfectly cooked, the staff was awesome. I'm going back this Tuesday July the 8th!!  oh yeah!!!!"}
{"text":"I han an amazing dinner, the customer service was so great. I enjoyed spending a wonderful night with friends, I will definitely be going back to eat again. I love Brazilian food, my 1st time but not my last...."}
{"text":"Food was great. We went to Bertoluccis months ago when it first opened. It was good then but they were just starting out. Well they definitely got in the groove because the place was busy. 7 -10 different types of meat. This is for the meat and potatoes guy and gal. We loved it, again"}
{"text":"Not planning on going back. The meats were pretty good but everything else lacked. I went on a groupon, so you get served 7 of the offerings. They hit me up for an extra  $10 to include all offerings which includes shrimp and fillet which I didn't take advantage of luckily due to only being served 4 of the original 7 meats. Moving on to the salad bar and hot plates, salad was very limited with lettuce,  potato and macaroni salads, cheese, and a pasta salad. The hot food was basically soups, which the Chichen Catcitorri was great. Waited for a while to check out and then the wrong table was charged to my card. In my opinion,  they are just short on help needing waitresses and meat servers. Food ok, service not ok."}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon, very happy with the food and the service.  Nice little family run place, the service was great, the food was awesome!  The bacon wrapped pork, the Portuguese sausage and the lamb were all awesome, oh and the garlic sirloin was nuts!    Very happy with the price, the friendly servicer and the food.  The karaoke machine was kinda funny.  Only down side was that the place was a little empty, until late3r in the evening.  Henderson needs places like this to stay open, so it doesn't become another McDonalds or a Starbucks.    Go to Bertoluccis!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have a date night this past Saturday. We decided on a movie at the Galaxy theatre so it made sense to find a dining option nearby. After searching Yelp for restaurants in the vicinity, I found a deal listed for Bertolucci on Living Social and since my hubby has never dined at a Brazilian steakhouse, I decided to give it a shot.  The location is a bit hidden if you are not familiar with the area (it is in the parking lot of the 24 hour fitness).   We arrived for our 6PM reservation and were seated promptly. As other diners have stated, the salad bar is small but decent. My husband really liked the  frejoida and we both liked the cheese balls as well as the flan. The fired bananas were just okay. I prefer how Texas de Brazil brings them to you table. The rest of the salad bar was really just a typical salad bar.   Our deal from living social included two glasses of house wine and since neither of us drink, we ordered two diet sodas. We were told we could each have one can. Uh, okay...we weren't worried about money so that statement was a little off-putting but no big deal. I did take the statement to insinuate that the first two sodas would be in lieu of the wine that we did not want.  We did both find it a little tacky to be served a can at a restaurant that seems to have a stocked bar but who knows? Through the dinner, we did order one more can.  On to the meat...the meat was all pretty good. Our favorite wound up being the bacon wrapped chicken. The meat came around sporadically which is most likely attributed to the small staff but the gauchos were both very friendly and personable. Some of the meat came out flaming hot and some luke warm. We had instances of empty plates while waiting for them to visit our table again and the amounts served at each time were a bite or two at the most. I ended up going back to the salad bar to find something to eat and found the rolls which were good however there was no butter so we just used olive oil with pepper. If you choose this restaurant, you have likely dined at Fogo or Texas so the bread will disappoint as well as the swiftness of the meat delivery and salad bar.  At the end of our meal, my husband thought a cup of coffee would compliment the flan nicely. We waited for a bit for someone to come by however other than the gauchos who are busy running from table to table, we found there was minimal attentiveness for any other needs such as water refill or plate removal. He finally went to the bar and asked for two cups of coffee and the bill when it was ready. Our coffee was brought to the table as well as the bill.  The bill included an initial charge of $5.00 for the first two cans of soda, $3.00 for the third can of soda, $6.00 for the two cups of coffee and the tax. This was a date night for us so it wasn't a big deal however I am a little surprised our two initials sodas cost us $5.00 ($2.50 each) since we opted not to have wine, and the third can of soda was $3.00.   All in all the experience was just okay. The décor is nonchalant and better suited towards an Italian restaurant. There are tea lights on the tables but they are not lit. The food was okay. The service is hard to rate. The gauchos were friendly and in my opinion, doing the best they could but ultimately there was no real attentiveness elsewhere. As far as Brazilian steakhouses go, I would recommend Fogo de Chao or Texas De Brazil. Ultimately we spent roughly the same amount of money but do not feel the value or the ambiance is in par with other choices."}
{"text":"I have friends in town and one was craving for steak. We decided to go here because of the groupon deal. We called in advance to make reservation and also asked if we can use two groupons for one table, we saw the fine print but wanted to make sure before driving all the way down there and also before purchasing two groupons to see if they would accommodate us. Or else we would've dined somewhere else. We spoke with the male owner and he said yes. Therefore I went ahead and drove us all down here.   We were seated by the female owner and once we said we had two groupon she seemed like she had no clue on the male owner speaking with us. She said she has never spoke with anyone. No one works here that would say that. She promises us. She started arguing with us before even asking the male owner and made a big commotion in that tiny empty restaurant and then... She started laughing hysterically.... What the heck just happened. We all just looked at her as if she was crazy. However the male owner honored it.  I thought the whole experience of getting meat cut at the table would've been awesome. Nope not at all. He came around with the pork sausage, pork bacon, pork meat, steak and chicken. It wasn't anything special, just dried meat. The salad bar I swear does not look like the ones in the pictures! It was not on ice AT ALL not displayed that way. I only yelped this place after we left to review it based on the terrible service or else I would've taken pictures. Even during eating we heard another customer having issues with their groupon. How unprofessional is this place? Very. For them to basically yell and be rude to their customer in front of the whole restaurant.  Their meat is nothing special. The salad bar was defiantly not appetizing. For $33 per person with the groupon deal plus $80 tax and tip after hand written on the bill. Yeah we all spent over $50 and hardly ate anything! You know that feeling of regret after wasting a big amount of money on bad food and bad service AND it was your friends last meal in Vegas. Yeah... The worst. A buffet on the strip would've been a bazillion times better."}
{"text":"We were a bit apprehensive due to some bad Yelp reviews but it was quickly erased because we were served with a smile along with some tasty meats!!!  We've been to the other popular Brazilian steak houses in town and to be honest this place isn't very far behind.  The salad bar could use a little sprucing up but overall it's a very good place!"}
{"text":"A quaint place. We read the Yelp reviews so weren't expecting 4-5 star but it far exceeded our expectations. The staff is very friendly and the food was very good. My favorite was the garlic sirloin. It's a lot like Texas de Brazil but not as many tables so it feels more romantic. I always feel so cramped when I go to Texas de Brazil. I did order a Sprite that cost $5.95 so I thought that was crazy priced. Higher then a club or high end restaurant. That would be my only complaint. But over all my husband and I enjoyed this restaurant and if u use the groupon coupon it's worth the price. :)"}
{"text":"Why was NIGEL M's review allowed to be posted on YELP? It is repulsive and an absolute indication of a misfit in society."}
{"text":"As a person who worked in this location as part of two previous businesses (Chianti cafe, trilussa) I can vouch for the fact that yes, it is a very difficult location to try and succeed in. That being said, I have been meaning to stop here for dinner hoping that at least someone could turn this cursed location into something positive and successful :) but reading some of these reviews, and miss patricia s ? Response to them have changed my mind. If patricia really is someone in charge there, she should be ashamed. You never! Belittle or disrespect people on yelp for giving their reviews, it is the utmost in un-professionalism and sites what a terrible attitude one might have to prepare for before even walking into your establishment. Every business on yelp gets bad reviews, all of them! The fact that you try in a snobby attitude to heckle and argue with every individual online makes me only imagine how you must be in real life. Caring about your business is normal and a great sign of attachment, but please believe your only hurting your self by reacting in such a way. All the best."}
{"text":"In today's society people are prone to sensationalism or embellishing stories to provoke a response. I promise you that this is not one of those occasions whatsoever, when I say that this place was THE SINGLE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. The food was HORRIBLE. The price was RIDICULOUS. The waiter kept coming to my table asking if I wanted any more, but I just sat there trying my damnest not to give him back the food that I'd just eaten (aka trying not to puke). Again this is not an exaggeration. This is real. Save your money & your digestive system by skipping this place altogether. Warning comes before projectile vomiting & stomach cramps."}
{"text":"Sorry, but calling me names will not change anything. The bug was behind my head in our booth by the window. Not on the floor in my home. This site is for helping consumers. Asking guests for good yelp reviews is tacky. Your business should speak for itself. I wish you luck."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Very friendly staff. Very personable.  First time eating here and will definitely be back. Met the owner and we were treated wonderfully."}
{"text":"Went here for my mom for Mother's Day.  Very few people in there on that day.    The salad bar is very limited and no where near as spectacular as some of the other Brazilian steak houses.  However this place is half the price so I can live with that.  The most important part of a Brazilian steakhouse the meat.  We were the first group in and unfortunately we got started with some way over done sirloin and chicken thighs.  The sausage tasted like it was made in house and goes very well with their grilled pineapple.  They give you a garlic bread which was different and very good as well.  Next came a bacon wrapped piece of pork this wasn't over done cooked a bit much for me but I eat raw meat, perhaps I'm not a good judge.  Now we may have caught the tail end of another diner to this point because ribs came out cooked very well still juicy and flavors that really brought the pork flavor out 3rd best meat of the night.  Next came a new round of some of the previous meats which made me go try their flan and fried banana.  Flan was curdled but the flavor was great and the caramel was perfect not a bit of bitter taste in it at all.  The fried banana not greasy at all crispy outside nice texture through to the center, very well done.  Finally the lamb and filet came out.  Their marinades, sauces, rub, or whatever is put on is great When it is fresh much better than Texas de Brazil and rivals viva Brazil.  The filet is good but give me the lamb chops and roast of lamb best meats of the night."}
{"text":"Honestly wish I could give this place zero stars. The meat taste like water. If you want to enjoy your dinner I'd suggest just going to Texas de Brazil and spending the extra $50. Not to mention the bad customer service when I told the chef that his meat was disgusting. He's lucky I didn't tear that restaurant apart with that disrespectful ass mouth of his."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse I've been to in Las Vegas. Delicious food and best of all, the most attentive and friendly customer service. The owner Humberto, is very charismatic and friendly, he even put on a karaoke show for us since it was my boyfriends birthday. Definitely recommend this place 100% if you're looking for good food and a great time!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on restaurant.com and thought how did we not know about it with it being so close to our house? Decided to give it a try and when we called to make a reservation like we do at any other Brazilian steak house the gent that took the reservation sounded as if he didn't understand why we needed a reservation. When we pulled up to a half empty parking lot we soon discovered the restaurant had only 1 other table seated for dinner.  There were 3 staff members a seater/water boy a waiter and the chef who graciously came out to our table with a ball cap on after I complained that the meat tasted old. He assured me that the meat was indeed fresh that he had just served it to the other guests and they loved it. Told me I could come in his kitchen and see he just opened the \"BAG\" of meat that morning. Besides the point that meat doesn't come in a bag I should have took my first clue with the very sparse and brown might I add salad bar.  They had the light so dim you couldn't see what u were grabbing. With good reason to because you didn't \"want\" to see what u were grabbing. Moving on to the hot over simmered dried up hot bar that was suspect too. Not to mention apparently the guy serving the dried old meat off of skewers was only on his second day of serving which would probably explain why on earth he was using a knife with the sharpness of a butter knife to cut the meat and he had to keep slicing and slicing just to Butcher the meat and barely give a sampling. Needless to say after the chef came out to \"loudly beg my pardon\" regarding the old meat I told him he c o you take his meal a shove it. After 5 bites I walked out with my family in tow still hungry and none the less richer because I refused to pay for shitty service and food. Did I happened to mention the chef came out to my car to further argue with me about how fresh his meat is and how clean his kitchen is. He even offered a tour. I advised him he should take a lesson from Texas De Brazil and told him if his food was as great as he proclaimed then his business would be booming and not deserted as it was."}
{"text":"Have been back a few times since our last visit and tonight the meat was the best it's ever been. Every trip it gets better and the 30 minute drive is more than worth it The food here is traditional Brazillian style and not a mcsteakhouse catered at tourists. The buffet had great appetizers and amazing flan. The meat was tender and juicy and cooked to the desired taste of us. We picked medium and this was perfect. The flan was so good at the end that I finished the last of what was left out.  While there are Brazillian steakhouses in town that are larger or corporate owned none can compete with the wonderful customer service of the owners and staff. We once again were treated like family and had a fun conversation. One of the owners even made us a special appetizer and brought it out. If you want a romantic date in a nice setting I would suggest a Sunday evening as it was quiet inside. However I would suggest any night and every night if you are looking for great food.  They even have karaoke in numerous languages that you can go up and sing whenever you are there to eat or have a drink at the bar.  The atmosphere and decor is nice. Not too upscale but nicer than your average restaurant so you can come dressed casual or in business attire and you won't feel out of place either way.  We for sure will be back again."}
{"text":"The meats were dry and over cooked, quality isn't cheap. I will give them thumbs up for their shrimp. Their salad bar isn't good. This feels like a bad hole in the wall. The service is ok. They didn't have hot water in the restroom which kind of worries me. I wouldn't call this a Brazilian Steakhouse. The decor is a mixture of Italian and spain. Needs alot of  improvements. The Manager/Owner is nice."}
{"text":"Worst experience ive ever had at a resturant. 1st the boy who was cutting the meat was cutting us slithers of meat. I had to ask him 3 times \"can you please give me more meat?\" Then the other cook was drunk as hell, can smell it on his breath. And they actually served rotten chicken but didnt notice till i took a bite and wondered what that bad smell was. I almost threw up. Anyway if you want a good brazilian spot avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Went here on a groupon.   The service is good, the meats are good when they bring them out. We were waiting for about 20 minutes for certain meats. And by that time your full.   Salad bar looks as if it was sitting out all day.   My opinion if your trying to keep costs low at least take the food back and rearrange the plate.  Hot bar lids were sweating hard core and it's  just a turn off from any of that food.   No sides such as potatoes or stuff like that.   For the same price as Texas de Brazil. I'd rather go there.   Also if you use a groupon. Be prepared to for taxes and tip. And they hand write the tip on the receipt. Suggest tip should be this amount and even point it out to you when they drop the check."}
{"text":"Feel free to disregard the negative reviews for this place. The food was on par with any Brazilian Steakhouse in town. The hot buffet section was excellent. The atmosphere was enjoyable. The servers were outstanding, my water glass never got lower than half. The Nutella cheesecake was served warm and practically orgasmic. The garlic bread was amazing and served in a large portion. This will be our new go to for Brazilian cuisine."}
{"text":"Although the place was small and a little warm the steak was amazing. I have been to these kind of steak houses all over the country. For the price and friendly staff it was definitely worth it. I will be back."}
{"text":"We came here with the lowest expectations post reading previous Yelp reviews, but we had a good experience. The meats were cooked well and had great seasoning. The grilled pineapple  was amazing. Service was great. We had 5:30 reservations but we're seated early since we arrived early. The salad bar was not great which is why I'm rating it four stars."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. Hole in the wall but food is good. Small place, great to take someone on a romantic date. I see a lot of bad reviews on Groups over 4, but over all my experience was good. There was a wait even though it wasn't busy but I noticed that the owners are the ones that does everything. From cooking to being the waiter. So overall great for a two person party"}
{"text":"If I could give this place stars in the negative, I would. My husband and I decided last minute to go out for Valentine's Day and everywhere was booked so we decided to try something new. That, was our first mistake. We ignored the low star rating and mediocre reviews and thought maybe it would still be okay. My husband called and made reservations, the guy on the phone insisted since they were \"so busy\" that night. When we pulled up, we saw a huge sign that said they were now open for breakfast and lunch. That was red flag number one, what Brazilian steakhouse also serves pancakes and pizza? Again, we ignored this and despite my gut telling me to run away we decided to give the place the benefit of the doubt. We walk in and the guy asks us our name from abo it 8 feet away. I must have said my husband's name 10 times and at no point did he even try to come closer to hear me. I gave up and my husband yelled his name so the man could seat us. We sit down and the place is DEAD...I MEAN LIKE NO ONE WAS THERE. This, my friends, was red flag number 2. How could a restaurant be dead on Valentine's Day? The decor is tacky, the music is terrible..all ignored. The man who sat us (who ended up being the owner) asked for our drink order and how we like our meat cooked then explained that the \"salad bar\" was open and we can help ourselves. The food at the salad bar looked questionable at best and I was terrified to eat anything. I decided on some rice and mashed potatoes because they looked safest. My husband got a \"salad\" which consisted of literally just iceberg lettuce and ranch. We sat down and the man brought our drinks, I took one sip and realized he had poured a warm can of soda over ice as it tasted watered down and the ice cubes were pretty melted. THESE WERE RED FLAGS 3 AND 4 PEOPLE!!! Then..the meat starts to come around....I'm not sure why this guy asked how we liked our meat because I had requested medium well and only received medium rare at most. I ended up having to ask the poor meat server if he could possibly bring me more well done meat and he gladly obliged. This was after half my plate being full of undercooked steaks. Once I finally was able to try the meat, it all tasted exactly the same..bland as hell. They also came around with garlic bread on the same skewer the meat comes on which was just so strange to me. After about 20 minutes I just gave up and asked for the dessert menu, which they don't have by the way..this place as NO MENU WHATSOEVER. One waiter gave us one list of dessert while the owner gave us a completely different one. I ended up ordering the tres leches cake which came FROZEN. My husband got the waiter's attention and he took it away immediately only to bring it back a minute later after sticking it in the MICROWAVE!!! The whipped cream was melted but the cake was still frozen! My husband and I were in complete shock. We said we no longer wanted dessert and requested the check. When we got the check, our jaws hit the floor. 44 dollars a person for by far the worst meal I have ever had in my life. We were just dumbfounded and had no idea what to do. My husband went up to the bar where the owner was to discuss the bill as I hadn't even eaten more than 2 pieces of meat and some rice. As soon as my husband approached the man, he began screaming at him and then went to the back to retrieve a packaged steak. He slammed the steak on the bar and started yelling about how much the steak was and how it was prime usda meat. It was insane!! After a few minutes of this my husband explained that he simply wasn't impressed and that I hadn't even eaten to which the owner said.........\"You aren't supposed to be impressed!\" I couldn't believe it!!! Then he asked my husband what he wanted and my husband said he would be willing to pay for his despite not enjoying his meal but he didn't want to pay for mine. The owner refused and continued yelling until finally agreeing to give us 20% off. At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there so we paid our bill and left. The owner NEVER apologized or tried to make it right and even tried to blame the meat server, as if it was the poor kid's fault that the food was terrible! I was disgusted by the food, but even more at the lack of customer service and disrespect we were shown. Please please please do NOT spend your money here. McDonald's has better food than what is served here!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke!! Not enough employees to serve at dinner time!!the groupon makes you think it's quite the deal.  It really isn't.  If you want to try a real Brazilian buffet, and you're in Ceur d Alene Idaho. The grill from imponima is ten times the restaurant this is.  I would have rather eaten at McDonald's!! Burned bread, over cooked meat.  It took me 10 minutes to even get my first round of meat.  We waited 30 minutes to get our water refilled.  Also the 18% gratuity for a party of four is ridiculous!! The only person who was working was the guy cutting meat.  He was very pleasant!! Should have read the reviews before spending 118.00 on groupon."}
{"text":"Bought $100 dollar groupon for 4 people buffet. First time ever upsold to $10 extra fee for each person for the extra meats. $3 for a can of soda no refills.  First restaurant I've gone to with No Coke or Pepsi. They also added 18% gratuity for party of 4 usually anywhere else is party or 6+ is understandable.  Service was slow..the owner worked as cook , server., host and bartender  He was completely understaffed for a restaurant.  It wasn't busy for a Saturday and now I know why. I was decieved had to pay additional $92 making a $200 dinner. I would rather took my family to Wynn or Rio seafood buffet and enjoy fresh, hot gourmet food and great service!!"}
{"text":"Despite the reviews we decided to give this place a try. Went by at 8:45 on a Thursday night. Everything said they were open until 10pm. They were closed. We called and they only take reservations. Oh well. No second chance for us."}
{"text":"This place is the worst \"Brazilian\" restaurant in Vegas. Has the feel of a Sizzler and the quality of food is less appealing. Asked for chimichurri and no one working there knew what that was...yeah...real authentic. Save your money even if it's the Groupon deal."}
{"text":"Friendly, family owned and operated restaurant. We got a Groupon deal for this restaurant and we were not disappointed.  The waiters are very friendly and attentive, and will take the meat back and cook it more if you prefer well done. I like the fact that the owners are actually working - they were seating people, serving drinks and serving the meat, making sure their guests were happy.   No, this place is not super fancy, but the food is delicious! Meat is less salty than other Brazilian bbqs I have been to - which is a good thing. The salt is not overpowering and you can actually taste the cuts of meat. The salad bar is small, but has good quality items.   I much prefer this friendly atmosphere compared to a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"well zero star is what it should be but I don't have that option do not fall for the group on photos and advertisement this place does not match it at all  if you already purchased this on groupon deal you better off not using it and let it go to waste    old, dark and poorly run place no staff just the wife and 2 guys working in the kitchen with dirty shirts and jeans  serving the food  oh and forgot the husband, well he showed up late with wall mart bags and they got into a verbal argument  very expensive compared to what they offer or should say they don't offer much  The salad bar was cheap and looked like was left there for a long time with no cover  didn't look fresh  uncooked meat with cold running blood  $3.00 for can soda and no refill??????????  so she charged us $9.00 for 3 soda cans $27.00 in tips for the party of four (4) and up ??????????? for what service?????????? just couldn't believe it  never seen that anywhere in Vegas ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   we called to make a reservation for 4:30 pm on Sunday evening  she responded 5:00 would be the earliest they have a table available, so we showed up a little early like 4:50 pm and there is absolutely no cars in the parking lot I mean nothing, just empty  so we thought they are closed or moved to another location after looking for the front door we realized they were open, they just didn't have any customers  we were scared to walk in but we did, what a mistake so please don't believe the positive reviews or photos on yelp for this place as they don't match but all the one-star reviews are accurate to the \"t\"  now I can see some reviews from others as well that matches our experience,   I normally don't like to leave a negative review but they deserve it, we really had a bad experience and I hope this will help other readers    by the way, we contacted the group on regarding this establishment   and they gave us our money back :) in form of credit to use on our future purchase  So I compared their prices to the other Brazilian Steakhouses around town and looks like they all charge very similar rates +/- $40.00 - $45.00 per person  with a big difference, they don't charge 18% - 20% tip on top of your total and taxes  I still can't believe she charged $27.00 in tips over our total including tax  she was the only one working there answering the phone and only attended to our table once  and when it comes to service, food, and location there is no comparison Please use Texa de Brazil in a town square  or  Viva the Brazil on the west side"}
{"text":"Bought a coupon of groupon, showed up and didn't even wanna step foot in the place. Very dirty, the meat was horrible there were bugs and roaches in the corners on the floor like they have been sweeped in a pile.. Do not be fooled buy the tasty groupon pic. Would never go back here"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The meat was delicious and the flan was exquisite!  They have a garlic beef that was to die for. I wanted to take a pic of the good but I just couldn't wait to eat. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fabulous customer service!  My husband and I were very impressed with the food! The meat was amazing! I loved the salad bar,  soups,  fried banana,  cheese balls, and of course the flan! The view is beautiful too! We will be back and we live near Aliante...completely worth the drive :) IMPRESSED!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made a reservation three days in advance for our anniversary for 6:00 pm. Internet and sign on door say they open at 4. We show up at 5:50 and see two other couples waiting who say they aren't open. Don't know why. We waited around for half an hour before giving up and going to Fogo di Chão. Seriously, don't give an unprofessional business like this your time or money. Go to an awesome place like Fogo instead!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had. Couldn't change my reservation to 7:30 when it was originally 7. The vibe was instantly creepy they had karaoke elevator music with no words playing the entire time.  No one in the restaurant. They had a salad bar very few options. My drink was a disaster the lime garnish was rotten. The \"hostess\" / server continues to grab our dirty plates places them on clean tables then picks them up doesn't wipe the table so it's now dirty which was irritating to watch. I don't know how this place is open honestly NEEDS TO BE ON RESTAURANT RESCUE !! Won't be open for long. Don't waste your money !! Not to mention it's also expensive !!!"}
{"text":"So I don't usually complain but this place is \"unbelievable\". My brother invited me out for a groupon adventure which usually ends up fun... not this time... talk about a joke. Lol   Should have known as soon as we walked in and seen the sign up front stating they won't honor groupon unless you tell them before you're sat... hmm I wonder why?!?! Oh I see... guess you get treated like a red headed stepchild. And to top it off they mysteriously run out of desert for the grouponers but not the other customers. (Groupon states desert included)...  Salad bar was a joke... servers had no personality... 1 can of soda is $3... 18% gratuity for groups of 4 or more (since when are 4 people a large group?)... meat selection was sad... on the bright side the grilled pineapple was good.... lol  Word of advice save your money and don't go to this little hole in the wall... you can go to costco spend $80 and get $100 worth of gift cards to go to Texas de brazil (a real brizilian steakhouse)."}
{"text":"Can I just start by saying \"Holy Meat!!!\" Lol. If you want some great cooked varieties of meat for dinner with sides of pasta, salads, mashed potatoes and more then come to this place! I wished I took pictures but I was too busy looking at the different variations of meat that kept coming to my table. Everything was cooked perfect and the service was very friendly. It's a little pricey so this might be a place to come to on special occasions. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is the first horrible review I have ever done. But this place deserves it. After reading other reviews, I'm wondering how this place is still in business.  We decided to stop in for dinner, as we had never been here before and we were starving. I love Brazilian steakhouses and have been wanting to check this one out for a while. I checked their website and it said open till 10pm. We walked in at 8:30pm, only to be told their closing.  The hostess told us we needed to make a reservation before dining. I would understand if the place was packed but it was dead. There were only two other tables. She told us those tables were leaving and we couldn't eat.  Wow. We came here because they're in the entertainment book and sounded good. Nowhere does it say in their ad/coupon that we need to make a reservation. If it was packed and they couldn't seat us I would understand, but if you say your open till 10pm then be open. I waisted gas driving here for nothing. The hostess also was not professional and treated us like we were in the wrong for not having a reservation. I have never once been to a restaurant that closes before their posted closing time because no one made reservations. Whoever runs this place should be ashamed. It's pretty much false advertising and your losing customers.  No wonder this place is averaged so low on Yelp. Any good steakhouse should be at least four stars. Go to Pampas or Texas De Brazil instead. Or, if something similar happens to you, go to Jaliscos Mexican up the street at Sunset and Pecos. The bartender Omar is great and their food is awesome. We went there after this and their carne asada was fantastic. Plus, Omar assured us that if they say they will close at 11pm, they won't turn us away at 10:55pm.  So in conclusion, do not go here!"}
{"text":"Despite of of the bad reviews, I actually enjoyed dinner here. We've been to Pampas three times in the past month, so we seriously needed somewhere different but with the same concept. We looked on Groupon and purchased the Dinner for Two deal for 69. We felt great because we usually pay 89 to go to Pampas.  We drove about 20 minutes to get to the restaurant and when we pulled up, we felt horrible. I was expecting a larger, more fancy establishment. Furthermore, we thought the place was closed because there were maybe 5 cars in the lot and the lights were really dimmed. Nevertheless, we walked up to check the doors (to make sure they were unlocked) and we could see 2 couples as we approached.  We went in and there was no one at the front counter. I quickly noticed a sign framed on the counter. Upon reading it, we learned that with the Groupon we purchased, just minutes before pulling up, we needed to make a reservation. I've notice that requirement in the fine print of other places but once we get there, they let us in anyways. I had a weird feeling because this place was way smaller. I knew then that we had a problem. A woman walked over after about 1 minute and I told her that we had a Groupon and we just read the sign. She said that we did need a reservation but it's ok for tonight. So she seated us promptly.  When we sat at the table and looked around we felt devastated. The place was nothing like we imagined. It was clean, but the place was dark and the salad bar was very small. We said the hell with it and grabbed a few plates.  The sides were remarkably good. Everything we tasted was seasoned to perfection. I loved the beef and potatoes and I ate more if it than anything else. In addition, my friend had white rice, the the fish in tomato sauce and chicken in tomato sauce (The dishes have names, of course, but I can't remember them). She made love to all of it lol.  Before I had the beef and potatoes dish, I actually had a salad. There was nothing special about the salad. I wish they had a better cheese selection. I only saw one kind and I believe it was a mozzarella cheese. I don't care for mozzarella so I didn't eat it.  So the first thing the server brought out was garlic bread and it was delicious. I can't ever make bread that damn good. After that, the meats started to fly in. Most were medium, although I had told him that We like Medium Well. To me, they were all pretty good. My friend liked the flavor of the meat, but the blood was too much for her. She said that she felt like she had a loose tooth lol.  The server was really cool. He wanted to make sure we like everything. He knocked over my friend's wine, it wasted all of her lol. She wasn't even mad because he was such a nice guy. It took a couple minutes for the woman to bring out another one but that was cool because we were occupied with good food.  The atmosphere was totally date night. They had soft rock playing in the background and it wasn't a turn off. The lights were really dim and the other guest were really quiet. I think they have live performances on some nights, because I seen some music instruments in the corner. Totally awesome!  After about an hour, the other two couples had finished eating and one couple left and the other couple was just drinking alcohol. Either way, the server was just focused on us. He flooded us with all kinds of meats for about 10 minutes. We loved it.  After that we were stuffed and I think he knew it. He asked us if we had any special request. We were like NO Lol, we just want the check. The check out was fast and we were out before we knew it. Upon leaving, the server and the woman was like byeeeeeee, thanks for coming, we enjoyed you, see you next time, come back lol...We felt like we were at home and they were family.  We would definitely go back! Maybe even tonight!"}
{"text":"There are two people who run the whole place, they survive off Groupon, people who come once and never return. I asked for a gimlet and they brought me a glass of pure lime, I will never return. O yay, don't fall for the meat upgrade they bring everyone the same stuff."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying this place last night and I couldn't have been more thrilled. The atmosphere was beautiful,  the staff was amazing and the food absolutely to die for! The owners Umberto and Patricia were kind and made eating at their restaurant feel like eating at home. I have read the other reviews and am blown away by the negative comments coming from people regarding the food and the owners. While I appreciate the fact that money does not grow on trees I find it completely unacceptable that people write negative reviews because they are incapable of reading a coupon. I would recommend this place to all my friends and plan on making many more trips back. Thank you Umberto and Patricia for the wonderful evening, food and company. You guys truly own the best Brazilian restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yikes. I feel bad because they must be struggling, but that does not excuse poorly cooked food, an awful salad and side bar and gross goop on their tables to ruin shirts while you're eating..leading you to peel off your shirt while trying to keep your appetite. Instead we voluntarily stopped eating despite not being full and left. The owner said, \"don't worry, if you wash it it will come off your shirt okay?\"....sure.  But the guy slicing the meat for us was very nice."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! The meat was over cooked and looked like it was reheated from last nights dinner.   The meat was not tasty.  The salad bar looked like the sane stuff w could get from a low end buffet.   They normally charge almost as much as the other Brazilian steak houses which they can't even compete.  There was little choices but the only reason I'm giving a 2 star was the live music."}
{"text":"Horrible does not describe this experience. The website states must have reservation.  I made the reservation.  We come in there's three tables seated  she asked if we have a reservation.  I say we do, not understanding why you have to have a reservation when your restaurant is empty .We had to wait for the meats to be brought out, very limited. The hot bar and salad bar did not have everything that was listed on the menu. We ordered sodas. Hey bring out glasses of ice with canned sodas and flexi straws how tacky is that? We asked for refills and got 2 more canned sodas. We got the bill they had charged us $3 for each can of soda. When I question this the owner tried to tell me that's what Texas de Brazil charges I in fact have been there and no that is not what they charge for sodas, beverages are free refills and your glasses are kept full at Texas de Brazil. And they do not bring the drinks out on cans. If you want to go to Brazilian steakhouse Texas de Brazil is the place to go. If I had not had a Groupon when we walked in the door we would have left because of the rancid smell of the place. They also give you one set of tongs that they place on the table and they allow the skewers to touch your plate when they're serving the meat. This is an experience we will never forget that we will never repeat! This will be a great goupon for your worst enemy."}
{"text":"Dear Groupon clients and the public...  CALL THE BOARD OF HEALTH    I beg of you to review the comments. Yes you'll think that some of us are exaggerating and I understand that. However Please before buying a Groupon or sitting down to eat go and inspect what you expect... they're a lovely couple that put on a great show but that's what it is a show. Go look at the kitchen look at the salad bar, that the food is kept in all night long.   I had a serious complaint of mold in the salad bar not just a little but a large amount and brought it up to the owner,  she said she just fired the chef and sent him home. Her husband is the chef and waiter and he was still there.... I wish I would have snapped on photo but I was in disbelief of the amount of mold... Please be careful someone is gonna get sick and quite possibly die"}
{"text":"Very odd experience.  The host and server (owners?) were both friendly enough - they get high marks.  Outside of that, nothing to say that is very positive.  Salad bar was not very good.  You have to take the plastic covers off just too see what is in the container.  Not a lot of selection.  The meat is served by one person...making the experience very slow.  The meat didn't have very much flavor.  Price is very high for what you get.  Would definitely recommend a different brazilian steak house."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The garlic steak and garlic break are awesome!!! The service was the best service I have ever had. Prompt and very polite.   There are a lot of people complaining about the time between meats but if they are busy it would be a longer wait. This is a small business with few employees. If you go in there understanding that then you will have a great experience.   I will defiantly be coming here again in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmmm mmMmmMmM so good. The meats were all amazing and flavored very well. Juicy juicy. We had the Brazilian drinks caipirinha and so tasty... We ordered second rounds. They have a nice salad bar area with some soups, pickles, olives, fruit and salad. The service was outstanding, smiles all around. Meat like every 5 minutes... All hot, juicy and fresh. Everyone there was happy to be there and it showed. The owner came up to us after and even gave us his business card. This is a good family business and we will def be back and bring friends!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there mainly because we had a 2 for 1 coupon. We were warmly greeted at the door by the hostess (we later found out she was the owner's wife). The service was excellent (we also found out that our server was also the owner/chef!). The owner's son is also a server! The food was delicious! With the all you can eat policy, we sure filled up! It was heartwarming to be in such a nice family's establishment! We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"This is based on the \"groupon deal\"  DO NOT purchase the Groupon. This is completely false advertising. I purchased the 4 people option. The food is decent and ect. But I do not like being lured to a place for the wrong reasons. Basically you think you are getting this wonderful deal but at the end of your dinner you are hit with taxes and gratitude for party's of 4. Oh yeah how convenient right, have you heard of any restaurant of gratitude for 4 people? I have never. And maybe there are some out there maybe for HIGH END restaurants.   So the \"gratitude ect.\" comes out to be around $40. When we ask for the menu and prices. First there is no written menu so they can change their price whenever they feel like it. Secondly do you know how much is it to go there regularly without a coupon per person? It is around $43, now multiple this by 4 it equals $172 now minus $132 (Groupon deal) and add the $40 of \"gratitude\" = $172. Does not take a genius.  This Groupon should say free wine and dessert and NOT say you are getting half off of the food. Such a lie!   If you go just go without the coupon, but from what I read and seen this place is just a trap for groupons. No wonder they are so strict on reservations they know they need to have plenty of room for the poor Groupon people.  More on the food, there is not much variety on meats, some taste dry. The salad bar is basic you probably get better salad from hometown buffet. The only good thing was the free \"wine\" which according to the waitress it costs $22 I looked online it was about $5. So done."}
{"text":"This place is OK at best.   Most of the meats had a good flavor but were very tough and chewy (with the exception to the tri-tip). The meats honestly seemed to be of lower quality that I would expect from a steakhouse.The pre cooked foods at the salad bar and buffet were also pretty sad. The selection was decent, and the frequency that the meats came out at was good.   The ambiance was a little awkward. They had Brazilian music videos on the TVs at all times, which was very strange and brought down the atmosphere.   One of my personal pet peeves that drives me absolutely insane is when a restaurant serves you your drinks in a can. Its just feels very cheap, and a little insulting when your paying so much for a meal. Especially at $3 a can, I am well aware that Texas De Brazil did the same the last time I went there, but its still no excuse in my mind.  Over all the experience was ok. The staff members were friendly and the service was definitely on point.  However, due to the meat  just being meh and the vibe being meh I can only give two stars."}
{"text":"Friendly husband and wife owned Brazilian steakhouse. Reservation only. Large bar and wine selection made my first impression. My second impression was the odd decor (i.e. poorly pixel sail boat printed table tops). The all you can eat salad and cheese bar could use some more love, even if it's only in terms of presentation. But, of the cheese offered, they were good. The all you can eat hot food selection included: pot roast, chicken soup (too salty for my liking), chicken marsala, mashed potatoes, black beans, and 2-3 other chicken choices). Generous selection of juicy meats the owner personally grills and serves to your content and without wait. Im not sure the experience was worth the $50 Groupon for two and upgrade of $10/pp for additional premium selection of meats. Drinks and dessert not included. Without a Groupon, I would definitely pass (would have been a $100-$120 meal for two). Too expensive. I would elect for Fogo de Chao. For the same price they have better sides included with your meal: addicting cheese bread, mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and caramelized bananas. Moreover, they offer Guarana and limeade."}
{"text":"Went to try and stood there waiting for 25 minutes before being seated. When we asked the female owner if it would be ok to seat ourselves she was rather rude and told us she would be with us shortly.  The food was good though. But the wait was toooooo long ."}
{"text":"Don't ever go to a place where you see peoples reviews are at such polar opposites.  THIS PLACE SUCKS SOOOOOO BAD.  All the people who have given this place anything above one star were either drunk, high, or just never ate at a good Brazilian Steakhouse.  Please, please, please do them a favor and don't eat there and let them just go out of business.  With all the great food options we have in Las Vegas area, go somewhere else.  You will regret it forever.  Unless you like paying for crap because it maybe cheap with a groupon, don't do it.  Do not say you were not warned by the real consumers that posted here."}
{"text":"Be prepared that although it states it includes 7 meats, they do not inform you that they actually offer more than 7 meats and it is an extra $10 per person, for rib-eye and shrimps. Although I did pay the extra, it was not worth it. Also, they offer sodas in a can, so there are no free refills on drinks. They state automatic 18% for groups of FOUR or more, but our check came with a 20% charge. I paid it because the customer service was excellent, but the food definitely is not worth it as service for meats was so slow that we ended up full by the time all the meats were ready to be served. We started having to ask for 2 pieces of meat because it was minutes between each meat coming out."}
{"text":"Went on a date with my babe on a Sunday evening at 630pm.  You must have a reservation for dinning. We had a Groupon and did not know there was a restriction on how many meats you could have as it is not stated in Groupon.  The atmosphere was a little strange and the music selection was horrible. It was like someone's screen player on repeat. We sat down and ordered our drinks and there are NO refills on sodas.  The salad bar had very basic items but they did have a huge selection of cheese. However, there was no cutlery on the bar to slice the cheese and of course no staff around to assist. Above the bar they had a variety of sauces, such as basalmic, hot sauce, olive oil, etc but most of them were old and the tops looked like they have not been cleaned in weeks.  Now to the side item bar they had about 10 items ranging from mashed potatoes to beans. The website advertised a totally different selections. Even though the hot bar did not look appealing, the dishes were tasty. We waited 20 mins before our first meat arrived and then an interval of 7 to 10min. When we asked for shrimps that is when we were told that this is a fine meat and it was not included in our selection but we could upgrade for $10 per person. Since the service was so poor we decided not to upgrade. The entire time we were there about 60 mins we only received 3 meats. Finally, we never received any water."}
{"text":"This was the worst brazilian steakhouse or even restaurant we have ever been to. Was so extremely dissapointed. It was my Moms 80th Bday and after having been to Texas de Brazil, which is just amazing, I wanted to go somewhere closer. The salad bar was almost nonexistent, cheap choices of food, very slow service. We were told immediately if we had a groupon that we would get the cheaper meats not the lamb, shrimp etc and that would be an extra $10 each.  The meats were horrible and tough to chew.  They all tasted the same.  My kids were not on the groupon and not offered the full menu of meats.  We could barely get our waters filled.  Took forever to get our check. I then asked if they cold bring out the dessert for my Moms Bday and they said they don't do that.  Say what???????  Even the cheapest restaurants on earth do that. I was beyond upset, disappointed and depressed at that point.  I just wanted to get out of there.  Then I get the hand written check with the 18% gratuity attached. I was going to leave them an appropriate tip for the meal and service I received.   I only had a groupon for 4 people and paid for the other 3.  If this meal was even half the price I would have been upset for what we received. NEVER EVER go here.  The worst ever. Please read all the reviews and know that they are correct."}
{"text":"This place is a B-rated Brazilian Steakhouse.  It's definitely no Via Brazil or Texas De Brazil.  The salad bar and hot food options were not even close to being at par with other Brazilian Steakhouses.  The saving grace were the decent (although limited) meat and enthusiastic servers.  We called ahead and were given permission to use 2 Groupons for 4 people; however, the hostess still gave us a hard time about it.  She also automatically added gratuity and tax on the Groupon value.  Beer was $6 each.  In the end, it was not much of a deal.  Their regular Rodezio dinner price is $43.99 which is really not worth it compared to the exceptional salad bar and hot food options I'm used to getting at other Brazilian Steakhouses.  Dessert was only a super sweet and dense flan.  This place would not even be on our radar if it weren't for the Groupon"}
{"text":"There was a good deal on Groupon for Bertolucci's. The location is very close to my house, however it is a terrible location for a restaurant. The decor was pretty tacky and the salad bar was lacking to say the least. It seemed like things had been sitting out all day. They could replenish more to keep things fresh. To get to the most important part, the meat! It was delicious, fresh, seasoned well, and cooked perfectly. They could bring it around more often. A little to much of wait in between each meat. The service was very good and professional. I'm not sure what the regular prices are here. If they're around $30 a person I would eat here again. If it's more than that I would rather go to Texas De Brazil."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  My husband and I grouponed here for our 6 month anniversary- We couldn't have chosen a better restaurant! The grilled pineapple and smoked mozzarella were excellent appetizers and the Top Sirloin and the Filet Mignon were superb! Aurelio & Oscar took excellent care of  us and made sure we were never lacking for anything- our glasses were continually refilled and every  few minutes another round of some delectable menu item came round for us to enjoy.   We give this restaurant a 5 + Star rating- Very highly recommended!  :):):)"}
{"text":"We have been to a lot of the Brazilian steakhouse in Vegas (Fogo, Texas, Via, Pampas) and this one is one of our favorites.  This is a Mom&Pop place so remember that when you go. Don't expect chain restaurant mentality. You can tell this is opened and run by a family. The parking lot seemed empty when we showed up, but it was full by the time we left.  The salad bar is small, but I was not upset.. I usually don't eat alot of salad and only get appetizers from the salad bar in a churrascaria. The caprese had fresh mozzarella, and the fried bananas were amazing. My daughter loved the Chicken Stroganoff soup.  The meat was amazing. They do not do the red/green marker/flag to let them know if you want more meat, because they are constantly communicating with you to find out if you are happy and want more or something different.  They seemed to have all the usual meats associated with a churrascaria, but they also had beer marinated chicken, ribeye, and \"fat steak\"?? (the fat steak was like meat candy). The sausage seemed to be homemade and was also delicious.  Where this place really really shines is the owners and staff. You can tell that everyone that works there truly wants you to have a great time. ALL the waiters are very friendly. We didn't realize that one of the waiters Humberto was the owner until he was singing Karaoke and introduced himself as the owner.  Also the restaurant and bathrooms were clean  We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I am truly shocked by the negative reviews of this place. So glad I ignored them. Hubby and I just had dinner. The salad bar was very fresh, had a nice selection of both cold and hot foods. Most tables were occupied (at only 6:00). The meats we tried were fantastic, seasoned and cooked to perfection. Service was excellent. Our waitress was not as friendly as I would like but all the servers and Patricia, the hostess, were delightful. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the owners were very accomodating. We were going to buy a Groupon, but I just asked him if he would honor the deal and he agreed. Meat was better than the other churrascarias, but the selection wasn't in abundance. For the price, it is a good deal and I am crossing my fingers that their business will keep rolling."}
{"text":"Why this place didn't have a line on a Friday afternoon, I don't know. My friend and I stopped in for lunch (until 2 pm) but they were also serving breakfast (what a menu!) and $5 pizza. Forget Little Caesars. This rocked- they actually asked how we liked our crust! We like crispy, paper thin crust and that's what we got as an appetizer. We thought we'd take home leftovers- but there weren't any. It was great. We took our main courses home instead. Super friendly service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"really bad. we go out to eat every week. this is probably the worst meal I ever had dining out in Vegas in the last 28 years. we have better food in the cafeteria at work, which is free. This place charges $42.00 each, absolutely ridiculous. They asked us if we had a reservation and there was 2 couples in the dining room.......... Buffet was totally ridiculous, just crap. Meat was dry no flavor. Ribs were moist but no flavor. The whole deal just ruined my night. My wife could not believe I stayed and gave this place a chance, sampling their really crappy stuff. After a while I was embarrassed and had to find the waiter so I could settle our bill and get out of there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i went for valentines day and then went again for his birthday and THEY REMEMBERED who we where!!!  the son came out and talked to us with a warm welcome and he said I remember you two! i was so shocked because they where super busy on valentines day!! i really like this place they make you feel like family! they really go above and beyond. This place is so good and the service is out of this world. We recommend ANYONE to go and eat there. the food is great and so is the service!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the experience. Used the living social coupon and I thought it was worth it. I read the reviews and people were complaining about the gratuity but you have to read the fine print. It says on the coupon that it includes a gratuity in a group of 4. I used it for just me and my husband and it was an experience worth while. The staff was very friendly. It is locally owned by a couple. Husband cooks and serves the meat while the wife is a host and handles your check. They were both very friendly. The desert was also amazing! We had the Nutella cheesecake and I forget the other name but it was lemon based and its a Brazilian dessert. I liked the experience and I hope you will as well."}
{"text":"We purchased the Groupon for a dinner of 4. Be aware they will add 18% gratuity and drinks are not included as we thought because they charged for my kids sodas. Our tip was $43 and total bill of $155 AFTER already paying $100 for the Groupon. I would not go back. This place is not in a good part of town the soup and salad bar were not good quality and the meat was only OK. For that we paid we could have dined are Texas design Brazil or even Fogo and gotten a better meal. The cheesecake tasted like a no bake Pillsbury. Not worth that the money."}
{"text":"This was our first time. We had a Groupon we paid $73 for dinner, a glass of wine & dessert. It is all you can eat. Definitely not with 73 @ a Groupon rate. The food was good, it is family owned & friendly. It lacked ambiance though. I might go back if I knew it was less in price."}
{"text":"Listen to these reviews. This place is complete and utter garbage. My boyfriend got a Groupon for his dad, me and a friend looking for somewhere fun to go. We had just been to Texas De Brazil a few weeks prior so we decided to try something new. Unfortunately this is the place that we ended up.  We knew things would be bad once we pulled up and noticed that they serve breakfast and lunch....at a Brazilian steakhouse....yeah okay. Walked into the place and asked for a booth since I had just been in a car accident and was still sore. The owner would not budge and not let us sit at a booth. Instead we were sat at the world's wobbliest table with the ugliest \"horses running through water\" decal I've ever seen. At some point we were told the table would be fixed. But the owner ran off and never came back to us. It's not like they were busy either. There were probably 3 other tables besides us.   We were told it would be an extra $40 for the four of us to get the full selection of meats and we opted not to and thank God we didn't. The food was HORRENDOUS. I found a mouldy tomato in the poorly slapped together and warm salad bar. My high school served better food to kids from the cafeteria than what was over at that salad bar. After picking through my salad I started feeling a little weird. Then the meat started coming. It should be a crime to cook meat like that. It was over well done. Shoe leather probably would have been softer. Absolutely no flavor. No redemption. The chicken was burnt to a crisp. The red meats I wouldn't have even served to my diabetic dog.  The prices are ridiculous...close to those  of Texas De Brazil. (At least  there its worth it) and a mandatory %18 gratuity ON A PARTY OF FOUR.  I am a very good tipper. I work in the service industry, my parents worked in the service industry. I understand the importance of tipping. Even if service isn't great I'll still tip %20. This is the first time in my entire life I've not wanted to tip. And for it to be a MANDATORY %18 on a party of FOUR is absolutely insane. I work at The Top of the World Restaurant at Stratosphere and that isn't even a requirement until parties of 10 or more.  The music damn near made me go crazy. Just the worst karaoke renditions of songs you've ever heard in your life. Just... terrible recorders and toy keyboards to make songs that sound... only vaguely like the popular song it's supposed to be. Made the place like...more creepy than it already was.   And to top it all off, my boyfriend definitely got food poising. I don't even want to think about how that kitchen must look. The whole place was filthy.   Most of the five star reviews you can tell are written by friends and family, even the owner himself. Please please please do yourself a favor and do not come here. I'm sure it will be closed in due time anyway."}
{"text":"I was concerned when we walked in on a Friday night and the place was nearly empty.  My worry was quickly put to rest when the server brought over the food.  The variety of beef, chicken, and pork was outstanding.    I came here with a Living Social coupon.  The coupon included dinner for 2, desserts, and wine.  However, the dessert is part of the salad bar and not off the menu.  I thought it was a little misleading, as dessert is included in the salad bar."}
{"text":"I called a month ahead to book a reservation for 4. The gentleman that took my info said it was ok to have 2 couples use 2 Groupons.  I reconfirmed this because otherwise we were going to book 2 individual reservations. He said \"no problem\". 3 days prior to our reservation, I called to change our party from 4 people to 6. And reconfirmed that 2 Groupons were still ok, gentlemen said yes.  When we showed up, the hostess says we cannot use 2 Groupons and that she personally remembers taking my reservation and telling me this. I am confused at this point because I never spoke to any female during my 2 calls to this place. She gets argumentative with me in front of our party and makes me seem like a criminal after I've brought an additional 2 people to their establishment.  She demanded to see the Groupons before we could get to the salad bar.  After shaking this shark attack, only 5 of us decide to eat. The salad bar was small with few choices. The deep fried banana was tasty. The meat was ok, top sirloin and prime rib was my fave and they brought out the filet and lamb at the end after starting with bread and chicken.  I Will Not Be Returning to This Place Ever."}
{"text":"What a great find.  Tucked away on the East side, and over looking the strip, this awesome restaurant is worth the trip (even from the Strip).  You are served continuously pieces of steak, lamb, and other delicacies that leave your eyes wanting more but your tummy's not having any room left.  I will assure you that you will not be hungry when you leave.  The quite atmosphere allows for conversations without shouting.  The staff is excellent and accommodating.  Two things that kept me from giving it 5 stars.  The first is a salad, side dishes, dessert bar.   Their choices for dessert were limited and not very good choices, and coffee is over $5.00 a cup. Aside from that this place is a definite repeater."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the customer service. I've called five different time to make a reservation and each time they are either closed or rented out. They also canceled our previous reservations due to a party. This is very disappointing since we take the time to plan in advance. Definitely prefer to go to Fago de Chao instead."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, the flavor that comes from this meat is unreal, the atmosphere is very nice, you get almost a home feel, the owners are very friendly and hard working , my family will be back and I wish them tons of success"}
{"text":"Bought Groupon for $69.  Not worth the time and money.  Meat dry.  No dessert. Salad bar not good.  Got our bill and they included gratuity for a party of 4.  Not going back here again."}
{"text":"I was eager to like this place and support a small business; however, the food was mediocre at best, and the service spotty. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Our server was very nice and gave us what kinda meat we wanted! Really good food and I would recommend the picanha!!! It was delishhhh!!!"}
{"text":"Leaving the house without a clear destination in mind, the wife and I went out in search of a delicious meal to satiate our growling stomachs. Driving up Patrick as it turns into Green Valley Parkway, we again saw Bertolucci Brazilian Steakhouse. when they were still serving Italian food, we gave it a try and never went back. Hoping for a different outcome last night, we turned into their parking lot and headed inside.  We were hoping the nearly empty parking lot was just a sign of a lack of knowledge regarding the restaurant's existence, rather than portending the food we were about to consume.  Walking in, we were immediately greeted by a very friendly chap, who gave us a rundown of the price and how everything is set up. Deciding to use a gift card Christmas gift from my employer to take up a huge chunk of the bill, we chose a table and gave him our drink order. While talking with us, he let us know, if we had looked on Facebook or in the Lifestyle magazine, there are buy one, get one free coupons. This is nice to know, however, disappointing that we did not know ahead of time.  Being that there was only one other table sat in the restaurant, our gracious host lead us to the lightly appointed salad bar and hot meal bar, with descriptions of each item.  Looking at some of the meats in the chaffing dishes, I was hesitant, but dove in anyhow. As I expected, the meats sitting there, slowly simmering for who knows how long, were all tough, overcooked and featured an odd texture for what they said were filet mignon tips.  The rice was delicious, long-grain, Brazilian style white rice. Freshly heated bread was also brought out to us, which, had a spongy, tough texture to it.  In the hot table, there was the filet tips, steak and onions, some pork and beans, empenadas, chicken stroganoff, and some other fried items, in addition to the rice.  Shortly after we were seated and eating the items already picked up, the skewered meats began making their way to our table. We had the picanha, tri tip, grilled chicken and bacon wrapped chicken.  The picanha was very flavorful, tender, medium rare and pretty good. Their tri tip was also pretty good, juicy and with a decent flavor. Tasting the grilled chicken, it also was moist and not tough, but without much flavor. Lastly, the bacon wrapped chicken we were served featured charcoal in-lieu of bacon, it was completely charred, and barely discernible as bacon. Given the state of the bacon, it was no surprise, but still disappointing, that the chicken was tough, dry and without flavor, too.  Before we could even go through half a glass of water, our server brought a full pitcher over, to keep us hydrated.  Their chef was training a new staff member as a passadore (meat waiter), both of whom were very friendly. Chef's personality was very up-beat and you could tell he was passionate about his job and the food. He refused to let us leave until we had sampled the dessert creation by the salad bar, with such an enthusiastic smile, my wife couldn't help but accept the dessert.  Overall, the service was fantastic. The staff was very attentive, asked if we needed the climate or lighting adjusted, our drinks were never empty (or empty for long), our plates had food on them, to excess at times, as one should expect at a Brazilian steakhouse.  One... odd... thing, they have a gentleman playing music near the front door. Or, so we thought. A couple songs in, he started singing karaoke-style along with the music. It was a bit... painful to hear at times. He tried to have the lounge singer vibe, talking to the \"crowd\" and all, aside from a couple of regulars at the bar, I don't know if anybody else even paid him any mind.  The food though, it is always the food. For $29.99 a person, I personally did not leave wanting to go back. When I awoke this morning, I had the worst indigestion that I have had in a long while. For NYE, we ate at another Brazilian steakhouse in town, without this issue.   Don't think we will go back, despite how great the staff was, the food just didn't do it for us."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing.  The rules, up charges, tip policy and salad bar were upsetting.  One man show w/owner as host, barkeep, cook, waiter, busboy and buffet replenisher.  Service is slow.  Bin covers on salad bar are unsanitary. Reservations required but ignored.  Not up to standards of other Brazilian steakhouses."}
{"text":"It was a nice atmosphere, good food. Wish their salad bar was more varied and set up where it's easy to lift the covers and put plate down. Only side with your meat was rice or mashed. Would have liked a good variety of sides. I wished they had sangria but only cheap wine And some beer."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and have to say the food was great and the service was good to. This place is just as good as the other popular Brazilian Steakhouses around town and what I like more is that the atmosphere is more relaxed and isn't as big and loud as others. I didn't like the suggested gratuity hand written on checks, which isn't the right amount  according to the restaurant price for this dinner as  stated in other reviews. Also the Manager or owner commenting on reviews she didn't Iike very rudely. No matter what, this is a guest service business and should  find a more professional way to handle a guest's bad experience. Too bad I'm sure this place has lost alot of potential business because of this."}
{"text":"Very unsatisfied with our experience! The variety of meats were disappointing, goes against their menu on website. No lamb, chicken was in buffet style, majority of beef was dry & overcooked! Bottle of wine that comes with meal originally costs $5 at your local food mart. Salad bar was limited & small but to top that off there was mold in the baby corn! Service was not great, water remained not refilled until the end of our meal. We discussed our service & quality of food with the manager, he chose to not take any action to compensate our bill in any way to make it right. If a customer finds mold in your food I would think you would do something to correct it to keep your customers & uphold your business! In addition, they said there were no reservations available at 7 or later & the place maybe had 5 tables occupied, hmmmm!?! Despite the unpleasant review above their grilled pineapple & garlic bread was delicious! I am unhappy that this app makes me select even 1 star!"}
{"text":"Reservations for 6:30pm. Owner left closed sign on door saying closed for work function. Reservations were made only a week prior. No calls, no communication. Owner said call Groupon. $30 taxi from the strip to be stuck without dinner before 11pm flight departure out of Las Vegas. Thanks Bertolucci. Classy"}
{"text":"Let's be fair that place is kind of cool If you like a lot of meat you are good yeah is small family joint ...frendly  staff .. sala bar 2 stars need help really bad just an idea reduce a bit the items to many ....and most important do not over stock  keep small and refill as the nitte goes you are that busy lol ... I saw a lot of bad things reviews I was wondering if will be a good idea to go well I had the grupon aready so I had to go .. Not to easy to find  to nice place no long walks to the casino ..lol Even the is not a hosts  we got a hello and a welcome rigth away ...sat in a couple minutes. ... Vine was ofert cool ... And now the most important part  I was surprised with the all meat that was brought to the table a lot some med rare some well done . Well I ate a lot ;) :) Price wise is worth it if you use a Groupon and they suggested gratuity I'm fine with that everybody deserves a good tip in this business.... But the suggested was kind of high like 25%  or more we did tip like 18%  .... Over all its only worth it if you have a Groupon and you like to eat a lot of meat"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. So calm and romantic. Food is great and the owners are very friendly people. First time here was amazing and this times didn't disappoint"}
{"text":"omg, bad food, bad service. we got there no one was there, they busted my chops for that then made me wait to be seated. it got worse from there 1 poor guy would give you a small piece of meat then  be gone for ever . you have been warned. I saw the bad reviews. my bad for still going, mike Glendora ca"}
{"text":"This is the Worst Brazilian Steakhouse I've ever had! The meats that served is not fresh and they don't accept coupon unless you make reservation first! We brought the coupon for 60 bucks and they don't even accepted that! Finally we Paid 160(100 for party of two actually worth 20 dollars food!) I suggest that Don't come to the fraud restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had a coupon from Groupon went on a Sunday. The first red flag was we where the only ones in the whole restaurant. But we already paid for it. Salad bar was sub par... Just go somewhere else Texas DE Brazil is better and you get more for the same price."}
{"text":"We found this place on group on and decided to try it out. We were definitely not disappointed. It's a smaller steak house but the staff is very friendly and the food was great! I would recommend this to my friends. If you want a good fun experience with a staff that will treat you like family then this is the place."}
