{"text":"One of the best breakfast joints in Toronto.. Price, quality and service are all great.. The coffee isn't the best, but drinkable!    My friends and I have been going here for the last few years and see no end in sight.."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at the Canadiana, because it was highly recommended. The service by our waitress, Helen, was pretty good. The French Onion soup lacked flavour and onions and had melted mozzarella, instead of the customary Swiss cheese. My wife had the steak sandwich, which was cooked the way she asked for it, but was tough to chew. My veal schnitzel had more breading than meat and the sauce tasted like watery melted cheddar or something like it. The veggies were frozen/steamed. The garlic bread was not even warm when it came to the table and was clearly not garlic bread. The Caesar salads lacked garlic and anchovies, which we always look for in a caesar salad, along with real bacon, not synthetic."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey for a \"diner\" style restaurant (maybe 15% +), but ok quality and service.  I am not a fan of wedge-style potatoes, and their \"fries\" are very thick, and almost wedge-like; they are undercooked and flavourless. A diner must have good fries, as they are practically a staple of this style of menu. After repeated visits / complaints and specific suggestions (with internet pics) as per how to not burn bacon to a solid, dry, orange and tasteless stick, I was told to \"stop ordering bacon; get sausage instead\".  ???   WHY does the bacon on their burgers look great, yet every breakfast-order bacon look worse than dog treats?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going since my twins were 3 mths and my friend and I would lay them down on the table next to us while we ate:)  Staff is friendly, attentive, perhaps a little slow on occasion, but the food is well worth it. Always leave there full and happy."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Decore-outdated Food- great Price-great FYI this place attracts a much older crowd"}
{"text":"There's nothing really special about this banquet hall; though it's been here forever. The decor is old. It's simply outdated. The food is fine, but the whole place has that feeling of Florida in 1990. Not bad, not good, just middle of the road."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, and I will never go back. I went here because I wanted to eat breakfast. The quality of food is bad and the waitress was terrible (infact she was rude). It felt like nobody wanted to work here and serve food. Not even a clean place to eat. Stay away from this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here a couple of more times and had the Open Faced Hot Roast Beef.  It was AMAZING !!! both times.   I,m starting to think this is one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever, homemade, full of flavour, great staff and service! But do remember they get busy but its always worth the wait here ALWAYS, i wish i lived closer so i could come here everyday for breakfast, oh man Great job Canadiana !"}
{"text":"Call me crazy but I liked this place. It is very old school and there aren't a lot of places like it anymore. It was clean, the staff were experienced, traditional and super friendly and the portions were great for the price. Yes, it does appeal to an older crowd (my grandma wanted to go here) but other than maybe Swiss Chalet, show me a place where several generations can all have a good dining experience? I saw people of all ages enjoying meals and it was a Thursday afternoon. So it was hardly like a nursing home as another reviewer posted.  I had the fish and chips (as did my mother) - very good and they come with a salad appie. My grandma had a western sandwich - she asked if they could just give her a few chips (fries) for a taste and they did (no charge). They also quickly brought a plate so I could share some salad with her.  The menu is extensive and there is definitely something for everyone. The food is made fresh and doesn't have the microwaved feel you get with chain places. It tasted good to me...it isn't 5 star dining (nor does it claim to be) but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"The restaurant has linen tablecloths and napkins, comfortable seating and very friendly, attentive, and efficient staff. The food was great, nice thick pieces of fish for the fish and chips and the chicken wings were crispy. I would return as there is a wide variety of choices."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast place. A great place to have a decent breakfast. The service is fast, the food is consistent. I am a fan of their Canadiana omelette. It is not the best food you'll ever eat, but it is a great breakfast place - simple, quick, and friendly. It is also quite reasonably priced and kid friendly."}
{"text":"Being 25 years old I was iffy coming here when all I saw was 40+  Where to start.....  Poor service \"slow\"  Gloomy atmosphere all that's missing is a coffin to have a nice funeral service.  We got the garlic bread and Caesar salads  they were very tasty :-).  OK there is a birthday happening down stairs and some drunk is on the mic downstairs giving it a test by yelling woo ooh woo woo-oh in to it.   I got the Canadiana burger and if you check out the business photos it looks like they ground half a cow to make it.  Tasty and the patty was not dry.  The restaurant area bums me out I'll try the bar next time.  Lets not forget all day breakfast."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on a Sunday morning while in Etobicoke for a sailing regatta. The place was busy but there were still some tables. We were quickly seated at a sunny, window-side table in the main dining room. It was a little noisy since it was so busy - full of families with small kids, groups of young adults and couples, but still pleasant.  The menu is great - all your typical diner faves. I ordered two eggs with peameal bacon and homefries. If you haven't had peameal bacon with your breakfast in Toronto before, you need to look out for it! Texturally it's like a cross between a ham steak and a thin slice of pork loin- it is then fried so the outside is crispy. It doesn't smell or taste like the bacon we are used to eating in the states but is delicious nonetheless!   The homefries were different too - thick sliced potatoes cooked well done versus cubes or chunks. And the breakfast also came with toast which I asked them to leave off, and a couple pieces of orange. It was a big plate and a great value.   Service here was also very good - our server was friendly and efficient. The only confusion we had was at the end because our server was busy and we did not realize we could just go up to the counter to pay.  I'm not sure I would have found this place if not for the Etobicoke Yacht club being so close by, but it has a distinct 'local fave' vibe going on and I would go again next visit."}
{"text":"went here today with the family, the food was good the service was decent and the portions are large.  I had the prime rib, which came with fresh veggies, and mashed potatoes, and a salad, and it was quite satisfying, another person in our group had the turkey dinner which again was good but a bit salty for her taste, and the last person in our group had the roast beef au jus which was a bit towards the average side.  The garlic bread that was brought to the table was hot and fresh, and the salads were good also.  All said its a decent place for a group of people but the crowd here is generally older.  Its across from a seniors home and they seem to like this place a whole lot.  You dont leave hungry. thats for sure"}
{"text":"You come here and you're not really expecting fine dining. The staff is great from the bar to the servers. The host is usually friendly and all smiles when you show up. Everybody is really professional at their job and coming from a person who's worked hospitality before, that says a lot.   The food is... well it's good but I really can't say more than that. There's nothing really special here but that's not to say it's bad. Far from it, I've been here several times and I've enjoyed myself. It's simple and it's not pretentious but it's not going to blow you away. I think the best you can call it is consistently good.  Started coming here years ago with my grandparents who were fans and have seen the place  change. New faces have come and gone, The food is still good. It's standard fare especially for the lunch. A favorite is always the roast beef sandwich au jus. Although I have had other things, that's really one of the go to lunch meals.   It's mostly an older clientele. As I said my grandparents were fans and often times would bring me along with them to give my parents a night off as it were. It always felt like a treat. As as time went by it became an old and familiar friend.   As I'm no longer in Etobicoke I don't get over there as often as I did before but I always try to at least go once in while. It's not worth the drive but it is nice when you're in the area and want a roast beef sandwich.   The only time I would avoid it is Tuesdays at lunch. That's when a group takes over the banquet hall downstairs and there is literally no parking to be found in the strip mall."}
{"text":"Old school place. Traditional. Portions are big. Food simple but tasty. Will stop again."}
{"text":"I'm here right now, on my laptop, using their free wireless internet and having a glass of red wine.  The staff is very friendly and although I haven't ordered any food, everyone around me is eating and talking about how good the food is. It feels like a bar and grill in an airport, but has big flat screens all over the place and the booths are pretty comfy."}
{"text":"I live in the condos next to Canadiana and as a result come here every so often. The first time I came here with my dad for a late night drink. I can say it was very disappointing and dissuaded me from returning for a while. The food was bland and the bar area felt very cramped and uncomfortable.   I came here again on New Years with a buddy of mine and sat in the dining area this time. It was much more enjoyable and really changed my opinion of this place. Ever since then I've really liked coming here again and again.   Overall the food is kinda pricey for its quality but the service is absolutely amazing every time I go there and is ultimately what makes this place stand out over your average diner and why it deserves that 4th star."}
{"text":"Food and staff is great.  The bar area is the place to be - full menu and far less out-dated/stuffy than the dinning room. The crowd in the bar ranges in age from 19-90, which makes it interesting."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Friendly staff, great portions. This place serves good old fashioned hot sandwiches covered in delicious gravy."}
{"text":"It's good for a dive breakfast joint. Foods decent, but nothing to rave about. Wasn't impressed with the home fries, and I think they could change the frying oil a little more frequently. I would go back."}
{"text":"I've lived in south Etobicoke for about eight years now and I've never been to The Canadiana until a few days ago.  It was a cold Friday in February so my colleague suggested we go there for lunch.  I was expecting real old school décor (at the bar area) but I was pleasantly surprised that it was updated.  As soon as I walked in, I got a great vibe as it seemed like such a comfy, cozy place to be on a winter's day.  The owner greeted us with a warm smile and the waitress came over right away with the menus. There were a lot of older people that had already started drinking (LOL) but, all in all, it was a mixed crowd.  I ordered a cheeseburger, my colleague ordered the Reuben and we shared fries with gravy.  The burger was okay but (I'm going to date myself) the fries and gravy took me way back in time; they tasted just like that restaurant at The Bay in Fairview Mall used to serve.  I wish I could remember the name of it but it was like a cafeteria/buffet set-up. Anyway ...  a couple of patrons ordered the fried calamari and it looked so good - just like what you'd get on the Danforth.  Next time I'm getting that for sure!  Service was second-to-none and the waitress was super friendly - we made sure to leave her a nice tip.  I definitely recommend The Canadiana and plan to return in the near future."}
{"text":"After moving to the area back in September I've been meaning to visit Canadiana since the first week. Well just last weekend I finally made it there.  This place is everything you'd want in a breakfast diner. The smell of grease, awesome service and delicious food.  No, this isn't gonna be Michelin Star type food but it is going to do the job and give you what you'd expect from a breakfast. Meat, eggs, toast and nicely crispy potatoes. All for $7.95 including tea or coffee.  For the price you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. The home fries are homemade, but a little dry. Its busy place but service is swift and friendly."}
{"text":"Just a dang good diner.  Eggs are perfect every time - and I've been 100s.   Full of skids but friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I had supper there with a couple friends tonight.  It is in a strip mall.  There are two sections ... the bar and the restaurant.  We sat in the bar.  The draft selection is mostly Molson products so I had Keiths in a bottle.  We had supper.  I ordered Chicken Parmesan.  It's a big serving.  The pasta under the chicken had no sauce (so was plain), though, and the tomato sauce on the chicken had a BBQ sauce taste which I found odd."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat there for 15 minutes waiting to place order. Nobody came had menu closed and was literally staring at them waiting to be served. Ended up paying for coffee and water bottles and left. If you are under age of 60 you probably won't get treated with respect. HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"This is my second time renting their hall area and I have to say again I was very impressed.  The staff were helpful and very accommodating.  The price options are spot on and I believe the service alone is incomparable for the price.  The food is always fresh and the whole hall is set up to exactly your specifications.... last minute changes are no problem at all.  I've used their hall twice in the past and plan to use them for my baby shower in the near future as well."}
{"text":"Canadiana  I've been to this place for lunch several times, so my review is based on the experience in the front bar area, rather than the dining seating in the back.  FOOD:  I can honestly say that this place makes one of the best eggs-benny's I've ever had. Just the right amount of runniness to the eggs, and drizzled with their oh-so-buttery hollandaise sauce. Their reuben sandwich is also fantastic with an ample serving of corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and the buttery bread - do you see a pattern here? I like butter...That being said, the sandwiches are a bit too pricey given that they don't even include a side dish.  SERVICE:  At the front bar during lunch time, the server is almost always an older gentleman who covers the bar and surrounding tables. I suppose I shouldn't call him a gentleman though, as he's frequently a bit too cheeky, with a bit too much sarcasm for my taste. He will also frequently pass you by despite seeing you waving him down. On one occasion he forgot to bring something I asked for, and then proceeded to blame me not actually asking - not ok.    Even though this place does not get overly busy, don't expect to get in and out if you don't have more than an hour for lunch, as said gentleman is very slow with facilitating the payment process.   VERDICT:  A couple of fantastic dishes offered here, but probably not enough to ignore the shoddy service and go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"you know. i really love this little place. the food is always good. the staff is hilarious.  but as of today, i only have the option of eating there saturday and sunday....new opening hours only until 6pm?!?! what about the people who work who loved nothing more than a nice meal and a beer after work. im not impressed at all. way to cut off a big part of your customer base. theres always customers when i go in there in the evening. this was a fucking stupid decision."}
{"text":"Cozy little diner where staff is friendly and food hits the spot!!   Try their lasagna soup.... It's quite delightful!!"}
