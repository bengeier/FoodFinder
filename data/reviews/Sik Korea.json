{"text":"It's not bad but it could be so much better. It's expensive for what you're getting but the side dishes are good and they have good portion sizes. Services is fine, it's what you expect when you look at the place. So fine, if I want something in the area and too lazy to drive out this place would do in a pinch. The first time I got take out here they packed my order with all the side dishes as well, so I thought OK that's pretty good value. The second time I ordered take out they did not pack the side dishes, without side dishes this place is totally not worth it. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade) I ordered the Gun Mando (deep fried dumplings) and the Spicy Sausage Soup, and was presented with a massive amount of food that I ate for lunch and packed for dinner. Simply put, the Gun Mando was crunchy and yum, the Spicy Sausage Soup was scalding, but tasted authentic. The food was slightly above par, but very high in sodium, and left me parched the entire afternoon (and night, since I packed it for dinner, too), even after I drank water non-stop.   Ambience 3/5 (15% of final grade) I was seated at a little booth designed for two people, but I went to lunch alone so it was very nice, because it gave me the privacy to quietly surf the web and WeChat while enjoying my down-time. The restaurant itself felt like something out of a Korean drama--slighty rustic and lively only in a way an authentic east-Asian restaurant would be, while still being clean. The drawback and the reason why I didn't give them a 3.5/5 for ambience is because the front counter is located very awkwardly, so that it was concealed when I walked in - didn't know where to go to get seated!  Service 2.5/5 (15% of final grade) I had to walk to the awkwardly located and concealed front counter to get seated, and wasn't greeted when I walked in. I did, however, receive smiles from the staff when I got their attention to order.  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) For Korean food, it was at par. For my meal including tips and tax I paid $20. My $20 meal was split into two and I ended up eating it for dinner, too. Though, so the price for the quality is reasonable.   Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade) Nothing stuck out to me enough for any brownie points for this round!  Final Grade = 56.5/100 = 3 stars, and deserving.  TLDR: Not a priority to revisit anytime soon, but it felt like an authentic experience with good Korean food!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. This used to be an AYCE sushi place. Now it's a Korean restaurant.   Compared to other Korean places, the menu selection is a little smaller. But all the staples are here.   I shall remember this as the place that makes their food really spicy by default. Most Korean restaurants tone down their spice to fit local palate. Not here, or maybe they thought I am Korean? Anyways I have been here both times and the food was spicy as hell. I had their tofu stew and that was equivalent to the extra spicy at BukChangDong. Even their kimchi and kimchi fried rice is spicier than other restaurants I've tried. Not deducting a star for this. Just a warning for those who can't handle spice. You better ask for mild.  The food quality is good here. But prices are slightly higher than average. Not unreasonable if you ask me for the quality. But when I'm hungry I don't mind just getting a cheaper meal at Joons which is walking distance.  Service is more or less what you expect from Korean places: permanently understaffed and not very attentive. But that's ok with me. Practically all Korean/Chinese places are like this. Just adjust your expectations when you visit an Asian place."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Service is great! Food is good. We used to go to the resto closer to Yonge/Sheppard a lot. But since Sik took over, this is our go to spot for Korean food."}
{"text":"This place is a Korean restaurant in the Korean neighbourhood that specializes in this stew called Boo Dae Ji Gae; (literal translation Army Stew). I got bulgogi in a black stone bowl and it was okay. They sell soju and dishes that serve as appetizers for soju."}
{"text":"This place has good bi bim bap and pork bone soup. The food is a bit more expensive (port bone soup cost around $10) compare to other korean restaurants  but I think the quality is better too.  In my opinion, it worths to pay a few more bucks to get better quality of food."}
