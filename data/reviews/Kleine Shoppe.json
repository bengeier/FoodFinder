{"text":"Adorable little coffee shop with yummy bake goods! I  showed up with a few minutes left until closing time and the employee was so friendly and happy to serve mhad the cranberry banana bread and was not disappointed.  Update: After the second time showing up business hours are not as advertised and I was left standing outside an empty shop on a Saturday! I'm very disappointed since I come from far and have a gluten intolerance so options are restricted."}
{"text":"This is a cute, corner coffee shop that is a must to try. It is my favorite spot to come to when I am in town! I frequent for the avocado toast and the cashew cheesecake (but usually end up trying all the treats). The owner has done an amazing job of making delicious, gluten free treats! Nice to see this type of option in MTL."}
{"text":"I'm at kleine shoppe every weekend for an iced tea and whatever new creation is on the menu. I absolutely love this place! The owner, Katie, and her team are friendly and welcoming. I've tried just about every dessert and enjoyed them all. The coffee is deliciously smooth.   Prices are decent considering everything is gluten free, generously portioned and made from scratch. Katie even makes her own chocolate. The brownie is a must try! It's the perfect place to sit down and make yourself comfortable or grab something to go."}
{"text":"This cozy little shop near the Atwater market offers a variety of baked goods, coffee, light lunches and brunches on the weekends too. The menu is all gluten free!   The shop is operated by the owner so the wait for my order seemed a little long and that is the only reason for the four instead of five stars. My iced coffee with almond milk was made on order, and with the friendliest of service.   The little shop is just plain cute! Oversized regal sofa by the window, a few tables and chairs, soft colours on the wall, add to the coziness of the space.   I'll definitely return for some of food; daily specials are written out on a chalkboard and I can assure you that the place smelled delicious!"}
{"text":"This welcoming spot is a great place for gorgeous casual food that just happens to also be gluten free. We loved our exquisitely presented and delicious avocado toast, lemonade, and the pièce de résistance, the blueberry vegan cheesecake.  Make sure you have it."}
{"text":"Delicious yummies and coffee. Great ambience and lovely aesthetics. Definitely a nice place whether you are on the go or want to just sit down and talk to someone with a nice cuppa. Baked goods leave you feeling good and are not just your normal cookies, but fun things to try (faux blueberry cheesecake with no cheese but cashews instead). Must try"}
{"text":"I had the avocado toast, blackberry and apple square and the like cake. So. Freakin'. Delicious! The toast was crispy and had plenty of avocado stacked up high, the square reminded me of grandma's baking treats and the cake was simply bursting with flavor! This bakery is on a new level of awesomeness, all while checking the gluten free, dairy free AND refined sugar free boxes (these are no easy checks for a baker). I'm going to be a favorite customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Cute and small coffee shop on Notre Dame. I had the cashew milk latte and it was far from what I was expecting. Maybe cashew milk is not the best for lattes? Perhaps try something different.The service overall was good."}
