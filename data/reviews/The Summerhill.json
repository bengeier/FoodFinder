{"text":"Dropped in here for dinner on the way to a friend's cottage. I would advise you to keep going, there's a McDonalds further up the road where at least you know what your getting. There is a definite bad septic tank smell on the back patio. I had the fish and chips which comes very plainly on the plate and was only ok. My friend had the margherita pizza which was very obviously from frozen and heated in a microwave. We didn't expect Terroni quality but if they can't make a fresh pizza for the price they don't deserve to feed people. Hugely disappointing and inedible. On the plus side the parking was good and the wait staff were all pleasant."}
{"text":"We live in Caledon and my friend introduced me to this restaurant. We love the ambiance in the pub, service is always great and the food is never a disappointment. We live that the menu always has a few specials but please bring back the roasted chicken dinner with au jus! We are now regulars!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and innovative! Finally a new restaurant that's different from the rest. I will definitely go back soon."}
