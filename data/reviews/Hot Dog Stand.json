{"text":"Cheap, convenient and delicious. Definitely not healthy, but a lifesaver at 3am on a Friday night"}
{"text":"probably the best sausage you will ever have! definitely a staple of downtown Toronto :)  it's also great that there's sooo many toppings for you to choose from to add onto your hotdog/sausage. a super quick snack for 4 bucks"}
{"text":"Oh the infamous hotdog stand that is happily located right in front of UofT's Robarts library.   At times when I barely have enough money and craving something to eat this is one of the places that I go to. With a great location and cheap prices for sausages and drinks compared to the \"gourmet\" food offerings at UofT.   I mean you can't go wrong with fries food or hotdogs! So the only reason I'm giving it such a low rating is that I don't want to promote eating such horribly unhealthy food. My rating is just to deter others from eat this high sodium and unnutritional food choice. But hey if you love and don't mind putting this stuff in your body go for it!   -CL"}
