{"text":"We stopped here on a whim one day to grab a quick bite.  It is the order at the counter style then pay before your food is brought to you at a table.  Naans came out hot and fresh.  We ordered the Sultani Kabab platter which comes with rice.  Good amount of food.  You can definitely split a platter with someone and leave full. Service was fairly quick.  We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful addition to the area. It is clean, with friendly staff and with great tasting food. 
My recommendations are: mantoo - a tasty steam dumpling filled with ground beef and drizzled with light fresh yogurt; bolanee - a roti filled with tasty potato; mains - tandoori chicken kebab, or shish kebab. I find the tandoori chicken has great flavour and so moist. They offer beef korma - although it's not on the menu and the chicken breast kebab will not disappoint either. The naan is typical Afghani naan and is a great side if you pick the korma.
Very nice host who offers suggestions for the undecided. I plan on trying all dishes!
For mains- definitely tandoori chicken kebab :)"}
{"text":"This is a terrific  place to eat! Authentic tasting food with  professional and friendly staff. The prices are great and the location is very convenient. Thanks for a nostalgic and gratifying experience! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but the food is strictly average. The kebabs and lamb shank were bland and tasteless and tasted more like boiled meat with some spices on top. It's kind of self serve and we found the girls taking the order to be quite rude. Won't be going back there again as they offer nothing special and much better kebabs can be had in Durham region"}
{"text":"I Have had many many meals here,dined in; taken out, even ordered catering numerous times. That being said. That should point out that their food is excellent, in both taste, food portions;& awesome options they provide. The owner is always present and gladly responds to any last min request you may have regarding your order. The staff is kind and respectable towards everyone. I have made last minute changes to catering that their kindly obliged to. The Dine In ambience has calming effect. Furniture is ethnic to Central Asia, photos of Afghanistan are on the wall, warm brown color concept with easy to read screen menu. Main concept for food is Afghan cuisine. But also provide tandoori chicken, chicken karayeii(curry chicken) as some of their options. Some of the things I have enjoyed was the Mantuu(Afghan minced beef dumplings), kabuli (rice topped with carrots raisins)with Barg(sirloin cubed ). And their tasty Shredded chicken(tandoori) on rice/or fries. But again give it a try and you will thank me! Desserts they have Frini(Afghan milk pudding). Am I a repeated client, yes!"}
{"text":"Tried mantoo were amazing! Great service and the prices were reasonable!!! Defiantly going back !"}
{"text":"First off - lovely interior. Very clean - not a huge area, but has good sitting and private room.

Tried out variety of dishes - pretty much their whole menu

Great flavors, their Mantoo is one of the better ones from most places I've had...I usually don't like Mantoo, but it was good here.

The lamb shank with rice was amazing. Amazingly tender lamb (like butter!)

Tandoori chicken on Fries was ridiculously good! The combination is awesome? - def ask them to sauce it up! 

Salmon is like...salmon! (I'm not a huge fish person! Lol) 

The tandoori chicken pizza was good as well! The portion is great!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for a post workout meal and this seemed to be the healthiest option around, and I'm really glad I stopped by! 

I really loved the atmosphere and decor had a carry homelike and cozy feel to it. I ordered a tandoori chicken wrap and it was blessed. The wrap came together perfectly and the meat was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I will defiantly be back to try some of the other dishes, I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good food, quiet. No mango shake and slow service. They had the platter for four and mantoo. Could smell someone in the back smoking a cigarette."}
{"text":"very, very, very dirty people!!..my son and I went to eat there but tables and counter were full of dirty dishes, we came back 20 minutes later and no change so we vamoosed!"}
{"text":"The Kabab Shoppe serves Afghan bbq, and I have been there many times.

I recommend the Mantoo, which has a nice light pastry and is well-stuffed.

The dish that I order every time is Kabuli rice with Lamb Shank. This is so good that my Mother asks me to bring it for her, all across Toronto to her house in the West End!  A few times, the lamb has been a bit overcooked (hence the 1-star ding) but generally it is moist and flavourful. The Kabuli rice is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see a new kebab shop in Pickering! My husband and I have been here a couple of times now and have tried the barg, chicken breast, shish and tandoori kebabs. The meat was tender and flavourful but of the four, the tandoori and shish kebabs are definitely the winners for me.

The redesign of this space is inviting and comfortable to be in. The service is quick and friendly making this restaurant a great place to enjoy a meal.

I look forward to working my way through their menu and supporting this new restaurant in our community. I wish them much success!"}
{"text":"The decor and lighting were nice for a place where you have to order and pick up your food from the counter.

With dishes like Tandoori Chicken Tikka and Chicken Karahi on the menu, I expected bold flavours but found the food rather bland. What I received was different from what was described on the menu (white meat vs. thigh). The ratio of main ingredient to sides was definitely in favour of the sides.

Presentation was lacking, with mismatched plates. My dining companion received his soup in a square bowl placed in a round bowl. Huh??? He did, however, say that it tasted good.

This critique may sound like nitpicking but every little shortcoming added up to a less than ideal experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with delicious food. The wait time was minimum and the staff was very friendly. The inside looks very nice and it is well decorated. The quantity of food is impressive and the kebabs are exquisite. Highly recommend you folks to try it out!"}
{"text":"Nice setting. Nice interior decor. Friendly staff.

We had the boulanee appetizer. A hefty portion was served.

I found the kabobs to be a bit dry and the taste was not outstanding compared to competitors.

I won't be returning. 

Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Recently came back here last week and really enjoyed their new burger! They also have this new cheese bread which is a good appetizer."}
{"text":"Came here to try out their food.  I had the falafel with fries while my niece had the beef shish kabob.

Food was tasty and I like that you can get the main courses without rice (just salads and naan) for a cheaper price.  The fries was a little too salty for my liking.

Place is nice and clean.  Love how they mix modern pieces with their cultural pieces.  I would come back here to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I didn't done in but the food is delicious. The price is regular. Overall good. Would eat again."}
