{"text":"delicious food. also polite staff, unlike the place a couple doors down in this plaza."}
{"text":"Excellent food and value, we have been here many times and their food has been consistently good.  We have tried many things on the menu like butter chicken, the qormas, and karahis.  Their kebobs and bbq chicken are also good.  They also have various biryanis.   If you like spicy food ask for spicy and the food takes another dimension.  The chicken samosas are exceptionally good.  It is a take out place primarily but you can eat there as well.  On top of good freshly made food they also have sweets and snacks as well.   Note that almost all dishes come with free naan for takeout.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The novelty has worn off. It started of as an amazing place. Now disgusted with owners handling cash and handling food. Very unhygenic, lady cashier was sick, rather then using a tissue...using her sleeve gross.. Food has changed from flavor to flavorless blahh.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I had the dehi behley (dahi bara). It was spectacular. Instead of many small round bara it was one and a half huge one's broken into smaller pieces.  They can give you chickpeas and potatoes and whatever else comes with it and all the sauces and papri chaat.  Just $5.00  This is a modest walk-in shop. There are a few seats and tables but nothing super fancy and contemporary. Maybe it is a work in progress.  I will return and maybe next time I will try other food.  Btw FREE naan with take out curries. Otherwise the naan is cheap compared to other places."}
