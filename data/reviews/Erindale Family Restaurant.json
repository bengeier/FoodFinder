{"text":"Friendly service, excellent food and great prices. This place is definitely underrated. I usually get their Erindale breakfast special which is more than enough food for one person. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is exactly my kind of place so it's a full 5 for me, though it likely merits no more than a 4 for the average foodie. It's ten-to-five and less than half full, the line up of tables extends far enough down to where the last few are on a severe enough angle from everything, which keeps the eating experience private from the staff, other customers, and just about anyone else. The fogged glass on the all-window-wall at the back means plenty of light without any of it in your eyes. To top it off, they don't seem to mind if I'm chucking 100 watt clouds with my sigelei (sorry if I just lost a few of you).   The banquet burger and a poutine are two sturdy orders that tell you a lot about a place like this. The way they shred the cheese shows care for detail, the sodium content of the gravy proves an invested interest in accumulating regulars, and topped off with the \"ribbons\" of cheese over the perfectly crisped bacon, altogether, says \"this is a good place to satisfy my craving without breaking out the plastic\". Tip well and enjoy."}

{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Excellent food and service. The chef definately knows what he or she is doing. Delicious and nicely presented. Tastes like professionally prepared: not canned or packaged. We will eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time with my 90 your old mom for brunch and we were very impressed with the food and the service and the clean and bright decor.  Mom had a delicious poached egg breakfast.   Eggs were done perfectly.   I had a peameal sandwich which was very nice with the bacon cooked to perfection -- nicely done but not dried out.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. I've tried a lot of different menu items and I always leave full. The breakfast is excellent and available all day for my dining pleasure, especially after a long night of not sleeping and a Sunday morning of not waking  up, when I'm really looking forward to breakfast and everyone else has skipped forward to lunch (or dinner) menus."}
