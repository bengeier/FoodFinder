{"text":"Seriously this review isn't so much about the food as much as the service. The food was decent but we had the best waitress. I've never experienced such a good waitress. She was quick to bring our food, our drinks and everything else. She continually asked how we were doing without being obnoxious about it. Thanks for a great job, Carlie :)"}
{"text":"Forget the food - the tables and floor were gross.  The tables were so sticky the napkins ACTUALLY STUCK to the table !  The floor was sticky - even in the bathroom !!!  If they are keeping the areas where the customers are in this state, I don't even WANT to know what is going on in the kitchen.  We won't be going back based on cleanliness alone.   However, if you want to hear about the food:  I got the catfish - worst I've ever had.  Breading was flavorless and no crunch.  Baked potato soup was really good.  Pecan pie was just OK - tasted like bought out of a grocery store freezer section.  The salads my friends had looked good.  None of us really wanted to come back though due to the stickiness of the restaurant.  It's a shame, because the O'Charley's I went to back home in Indiana is really good and clean.  STAY AWAY from this one !"}
{"text":"The food here is OK, but after our last trip there I will never return.  My husband, daughter, and I were seated at a booth in the bar with menus.  Then we waited and waited.  Several servers passed by us but no one greeted us.  I tried to catch the eye of one of them, but they were too busy chatting behind the bar to notice.  After we waited 20 minutes we left.  Inexcusable.  I can't remember a time I was disregarded like that."}
{"text":"Several in my party ordered steaks some 6oz and 2 9oz. All came out with 6oz steaks and the manager states \"trust\" me it's 9oz. Never asking if I wanted something else and stated she couldn't cook me another because it will come out the same. THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE I've had. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Being from New Orleans I know what good food is...unfortunately, I have found very little of it in Champaign:  that is, until I ate at O'Charley's two nights ago.  On the first night, I had the $9.99 Country Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and Broccoli.  The food was exceptionally good.  My waiter was a big tall guy called \"Bird\" and provided top quality service.  When I went back tonight, I asked if I could sit at one of his tables again because of the great service.  I was craving seafood. At Bird's recommendation I ordered the Panko-Crusted Shrimp and Hand-Battered Cod, with a Baked Potato and Side Salad with 1000 island.  Again, great service prevailed.  Bird brought out complimentary hot rolls and butter.  It was all exceptionally good.  And I think I am a pretty good judge of fried seafood being from New Orleans.  It was the first decent seafood I have eaten in 3 months of being here.  The atmosphere is quite nice here, with good music as well, and the resturant was very clean on both nights. O'Charley's may not be a 5 star pricey venue, but it sure does taste like one!  Apparently, it is well run, and must have good management and a good chef!   I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know what was going on there yesterday, but...what restaurant doesn't have available clean silverware at 7:00 p.m.??!!  How do you bring the food and leave the table without delivering the tools to eat the food??!!...and then, I had to go look for not only some silverware, but the server, ANY server, a hostess...they all looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for silverware!!!  This was unbelievable.

And the servers on duty at that time were walking around like zombies!  Every time we asked for silverware, the server would leave and never come back...THEN, we were given plastic TO GO knives and forks.  Seriously?! 

My hubs asked for medium well steak and got well done.  He didn't bother sending back.

Employees socializing more amongst themselves instead of focusing on quality of service to customers.

Very bad experience!"}
{"text":"Best I can say is the waiter was good considering he had to wait on a party of 30 by himself after about 2 hrs the manager finally came to table to see if everything was good. It would have been better if she would have helped him some. Drinks went unfilled took forever for waiter to get food to table. And then some orders was mixed up.  Needless to say this was my last visit."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and stopped in on my way through. Initially I was very impressed with the bartender Kristin. She was having such a good time with everyone at the bar and had a substantial conversation with me. I was nervous about sitting by myself since I was alone and she made me feel like I was home. The food was sub par. I left full and it was a decent price but i guess that's all that really matters."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes to get terrible service and okay food. Our waitress was attentive to my drink, however, she always seemed distracted whilst taking our order and was extremely rude to us when we were trying to order. The food came out okay, my boyfriend's steak was cooked incorrectly. We only got one basket of rolls when we clearly saw other tables getting refills. This place is a joke. Not returning."}
{"text":"Food was good, but wasn't too pleased with the prices.  I ordered a French dip sandwich for lunch and waiter asked if I'd like to add onions, mushrooms and peppers. I said sure. No mention that there was an extra charge per vegetable! 

When I got the bill they had added 99¢ per vegetable. I probably had 3 or 4 mushrooms, a few onion pieces, and a few green peppers. I'm guessing their cost was probably about 10¢ total at wholesale prices. Huge mark up! And no advanced warning. Last $25 lunch I'll be eating there."}
{"text":"Took the kids and wife for dinner the staff was friendly the food was great my kids enjoyed there pie it was my wife birthday and she had a good time. There was people laughing and having a good time my son was dancing with the music the staff thought it was cute.My daughter said that he was been silly"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very laid back. They are very friendly and attentive but not bothersome. Their food is very good especially the cajun steak."}
{"text":"A fine chain restaurant that I like to frequent. Extra extensive menu choices - Great chicken fingers, burgers, pot pie, chicken, pasta, and great appetizers as well. For Those who like to spice it up with a little alcohol, a friendly bar atmosphere to catch a local game. Great service and always a consistent experience. Once you try it you will want to return to try something new on the menu, especially after you see the reasonable menu prices!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group- I received the wrong salad, but didn't want to be 'that guy' so put up with it.  Looking around the table, nothing looked that good.  KIds eat free- about the only positive aspect to the evening."}
{"text":"Called in my order before I left my house and when I got to the restaurant the manager had taken my order and forgot to put it in & was arguing with the employee trying to blame him. There was a reason I ordered my food before I left my house....because I was in a hurry, otherwise I would have ate there. It seems like this place always has issues. If it wasn't for the potato soup..I would not come back. Get it together o'charleys!"}
{"text":"YEAH, Great food with a changing menu. I especially like the Salmon. The draught beer is usually fresh even though the kegs are three miles away and the beer sits in the lines. My review has gone up since the smoking BAN. Friendly bar and waistaff and many regular customers."}
{"text":"I am told this is a chain, but I wouldn't have guessed it.  I went there for dinner on a Monday around 6 PM.

For a chain, the food was pretty good.  I have the steak and salmon combo with rice and broccoli.  It was good.  Definitely a place I could eat at for the week.  They have a diverse menu with plenty of options).  For the price, it is worthwhile.

Service was very friendly and helpful (even got me a sample of grits when I asked what they were)."}
{"text":"O'Charley's is a wonderful restaurant. Good food, good service, and an awesome atmosphere. 
HOWEVER.
I have recently become completely dissatisfied with the management. Particularly the employment branch.
I recently (about a week ago) saw that they were hiring, so as a highly experienced server I filled out an application and called the next day to follow up. I was told the Hiring manager, Olga, was on vacation and I should call back in a couple days. So I did just that.
I called at around 3pm, I figured their lunch rush should be on its way to slowing down. She told me to call back at 7:30pm. So I patiently waited and called back promptly at 7:30pm. I spoke to Olga for about 30 seconds, and she told me to hold for just a couple minute while she looked over my application. 
So I waited.
and waited.
and... waited..?

Until finally it was 8:30pm and I became frustrated with the fact that I was forgotten about. I called back after they had closed and she told me they had been very busy, and that she had, in-fact, completely forgotten I was on the line. I said it was fine and she told me to give her a call the next day (today) at 3pm. 
I then proceeded to call today at 3pm. She was in a meeting,
My patience is beginning to wear off at this point. 
I called back at 4:30pm and she told me to just come in for an interview at 7:30pm. I became excited that I was finally being seen.
I walked 2.3 miles (according to my navigation on my Android) from my hotel, in 53 degree weather, wearing dress shoes, khaki's, a dress shirt, and a jacket. 
I showed up at 7:20pm and was seen by her immediately. She asked me very politely to sit at the bar while she finds my application (unprepared?). I accepted her invitation and sat at the bar patiently. 
She comes out about 3 minutes later and sits me down at a table, and starts going over my previous work (Steak and Shake, Best Buy, Jimmy John's, Clarke's Bar and Grill etc;) and asking me typical questions. 

(this part is the reason I'm writing)

She then looked me in the eyes and told me there weren't any positions open, and that they had hired FIVE new servers while she was on vacation, and she hadn't been informed of it until just then. She then proceeded to tell me I should apply at the Steak and Shake across the street, Like I'm a moron, and I Hadn't already.

I am not only a highly-qualified server looking for work, but a customer. I found this whole thing entirely unprofessional in a variety of different ways.
Say good-bye to my business, Olga!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch today and it was possibly the worst customer service I've seen.
1. All of our food orders were wrong 
2. The place was completely empty yet it took an hour to get our food and 20 minutes to get a table! 
3. The first thing the waitress said to us was that we couldn't combine our combo with the \"Free Pie Day\"?!?
4. Took our drinks for a refill and we never got them back until after we were done eating. 
For a lunch in the middle of the week, this should have been easy for them to fulfill but they were eager to disappoint."}
{"text":"I love O'Charley's! Every time I visit the restaurant I always get the chicken tenders because they are probably the best chicken tenders I've ever had, and I know chicken tenders...I even have a blog about the best chicken tenders in Charlotte (lovemetendersincharlotte.blogspot.com).

For starters every meal comes with these rolls that are fluffy, light brown, and glistening in butter...clearly a fantastic way to start any meal. Next come the entrees, or in my case the chicken tenders and sides. What makes the chicken tenders at O'Charley's is the fact that the breading is perfectly seasoned before being cooked to perfection, so the tenders come out a crispy, golden brown. Along with the five big chicken tenders you get with your meal you also receive two sides. In my opinion the best sides are the fries and the broccoli cheese casserole. The fries are covered in salt and pepper, but not too much, and they are crispy and plentiful. I love the broccoli cheese casserole because it's creamy, sweet, and there is rice mixed in with the broccoli and cheese so it adds an extra bit of texture to the dish. 

If you haven't had the chicken tenders at O'Charley's then I definitely think you need to try them. They certainly are delicious and it's a decision I don't think you will regret."}
{"text":"I will choose this restaurant again. They had to cook my food a little longer but that's okay. They were very prompt about it. The food was amazing and the service was just as good."}
{"text":"Overall had good food and fabulous service
I thought the sides and soups were a bit limited. 
Our waitress Cari was so nice, patient, and friendly 
This was our second time here and we will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful lunch here the other day. We ordered drinks as soon as our waitress, Stacy, had greeted us. It took a while for them to come, but my boyfriend and I were in no hurry. The waitress apologized several times. There was some kind of issue at the bar and the manager ended up making our drinks. After Stacy brought them to us, the manager stopped by to personally apologize for the wait and told us to save room for dessert on them. We were not disgruntled about it in the least, but we very much appreciated this gesture. Stacy was a great waitress. The food was prepared well and our pie was delicious. Thank you so much, guys! You made our lunch very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location a few times and we just did a company gathering there on Friday. Service is very good every single time I have been! They seat you promptly and wait staff are very attentive. The food is good, generous portions, tasty, and presented nicely. The menu is alright, I would like more local fare with more specials but, as a chain, they do a good job! The beer selection is decent, with even a few craft beer selections. I am partial to IPA's and they don't carry any--but they do have OMB Copper on tap! This is a good place, with great service, good food, and nice atmosphere. Perfectly located in G-Town as well! Check them OUT!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there twice. Meals are not expensive. They have several $9.99 meals all day. And some lunch specials for weekdays. The taste is ok, though a little bit heavy. I like their bread very much. Waiters and waitresses are warm. And the manager sometimes go around to greet every table."}
{"text":"My lesson of the day, do not jump to conclusions. My dad had to catch a flight and it was taking longer than we expected so we needed to get our food to go. We explained the situation to our waitress, Tammy, and she went to get us boxes and bring us the checks. 

Unfortunately, my dad couldn't wait any longer and he had to leave. I stayed and paid. I used $20 for my parents check and paid for mine with a credit card. When Tammy brought back the slip for me to sign, she didn't being back any change. Immediately, I became angry and felt like she was stealing.

Of course, I was going to tip her but it seemed extremely inappropriate for her to assume that I would tip her. I asked for the manager and explained the situation. During the conversation Tammy came over. She asked what she did and then she explained that she thought the $20 was my dad's and that since he left, he didn't need any change.

From her perspective, it made sense. We both apologized for the misunderstanding and I ended up giving her an even bigger tip.

The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is I wish Tammy hadn't gone MIA for 10 minutes before our food came out. If we could have found her sooner, we wouldn't have the mix up and my dad could have taken his food to go.

I would definitely come back. The manager and Tammy were very accommodating and the chicken pot pie is delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food very much. I like the chicken Pot Pie. Service a bit slow and the temperature was freezing inside. I would come back for the food, but need to bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Great food for value would stay away from steaks over cooked and dry service and bartenders are great. You are only as good as your cooks best lunch and appetizer specials"}
{"text":"First and only time for us.  Wanted a flavored vodka tonic after shopping all day.  Only 3 flavored vodkas available and drinks were underpoured with mostly ice.  I am giving 3 stars because our service was great and food was good."}
{"text":"Went by to eat lunch through service was horrible and the food not so good. We waited forever for drinks then food then we ordered the all you can eat soup and salad  and could only get one plate of food cause our server Bree was super slow and would have had to wait another 20 minutesl to ask for refill then another 20 min for server to bring it won't be back"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here. The server wasn't attentive, she didnt come and check on us. we asked for stuff, and it took her 10 mins (we had to ask for it a 2nd time). Seem like she doesnt like to serve asian people. But we still left tips."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my sister. It was her first time here. Ryan our waiter was terrific. I will definetly come back."}
{"text":"I had to leave a review solely based on the others..
I've been here 3 times in the last 2 months and It has become my go to place for business meetings in this area.
The service has been excellent and food was perfect each time. I can't comment on dinner service, but for a late lunch, this place can't be beat IMO!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a warm atmosphere and I've never gotten a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for dinner.  Happen to come the first time on half price margarita day, so had to get my fiesta on.  The margaritas are huge, & probably the best that I have had in the area.  If you go here, the margaritas are a must!  The menu offers a lot of southern style food & apps.  Everything from southern honey fried chicken to fried green tomatoes & deviled eggs.  Everything I have tried has been very good & nicely presented.  Service has also been good.  There is also a nice outdoor covered patio.  This is one of the only O'Charley's in the area, & is very good.  Great place to go if you want to try something different, or like southern style food.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"The service here is very poor and has been for a long time.  Their lunch specials used to be good, and we took the group from our office regularly.  Then something changed and the wait staff was awful.  Not polite, not attentive, the food took too long to get to our table or was wrong 90% of the time.  We stopped going.  Then about 3 months later, we gave them another chance.  Took 4 of us there for lunch at 11:30 am, on a weekday, and the service was awful.  They mixed up our orders, forgot to even write one person's order down, and we waited over an hour to get our food.  The hostess has been there for years, and is very nice, (Debbie), but the wait staff and kitchen are poor.  We definitely will not go back and will tell others not to go there."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed that I decided to dine here for mother's day, I usually get a salad to go, which is always good. We got there and the dinning area was quite dirty maybe short on bussers trash on the floor lots of tables left uncleaned. I ordered the Ribeye well done which looked appetizing but was damn near bloody.... ewh, the waitress graciously asked if she could take it back and put it on the grill a little longer, however I don't send food back, i just took it home to put it on my grill. Mother's day dinner sucked!"}
{"text":"My two stars are for service.  And the bread. Both good.  Food?  Eh.  I ordered their seasonal beef steak tomato salad.  This was a plate of lettuce topped with three (three!) quarter inch slices of tomato on top of the lettuce with bland balsamic vinaigrette.  It was laughable.  

The Nashville hot deviled eggs were good.  Nice portion size. This sauce seems to be their hook, because my fiancee had the Nashville hot chicken sliders. Which tasted much like the eggs.  Overall, not much effort put into the menu. 

The decor closely resembles a restaurant located on the ground floor of a hampton inn. Definitely a disconnect between what the wall art promises and the restaurant delivers. 

We don't see it lasting long."}
{"text":"My wife and 3 kids walked in this afternoon. Hostess barely even spoke to us. Once we were seated at least 4 waitresses walked by without even speaking or attempting to serve us. After 20 minutes of waiting for someone to come by we left. This has been typical lately at this location."}
{"text":"First time coming here and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice and the food is amazing. Had a little snafu but the manager was quick to fix the problem. This is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"The waiter we had had been working there for 5 days. There were other wait staff didn't even attempt to help him. We waited 10 minutes before someone came over. The manager walked by didn't even stop. When our order was taken he couldn't get that right. Not completely his fault since he was new... Needless to say, we left while he was still trying to key in our order... Service was terrible. Needs new management."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends. Great deal this summer on drinks!!! Would recommend and visit again"}
{"text":"The food was great, and service very friendly. Not a lot of Irish food given the name, but I will return."}
{"text":"If I could give the place no stars I would. (I just quit this job) I transferred to the Charlotte O'Charley's and it was HORRIBLE!!!! The management team doesn't know how to run a restaurant, and they are SHADY!! Amanda, the bar manager (currently) made one of my new (former) employees cry in front of a customer belittling him and calling him \"stupid\" because he accidentally rang in the wrong food order for a lady. Not to mention one of their older waitresses, Sha, tried to start a fight with me after disrespectfully stealing two tables from me and then proceeded to yell in front of customers, later realizing she was in the wrong. Also, after I quit there (because I didn't give a full two weeks) transferred my last paycheck all the way back to my old O'Charley's in GA (where I don't live) so their restaurant didn't look so bad because I quit after a few days of being there because I was so disrespected working for them and with their horrible staff. I came from a training store in GA and was there for almost a year and LOVED IT. but this team here at the South Tryon store is completely a mess. The managers don't know how to run their store, the servers are lazy and don't value teamwork, and the business is CONSTANTLY SLOW. I don't recommend working there. And the food at this store sucks."}
{"text":"First time there and probably the last. Nothing special here, is clean and everyone is nice but in a new place I expect this. Food was OK, not great, not horrible, just OK. Service was also OK, not a long wait but server was not back except once to ask for beverage refills. Very nice looking both inside and out. As said before by others, nothing more or less than Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's with a different name!"}
{"text":"Went here after the Illinois football game last night and we were pleasantly surprised.  The food was very flavorful, everything cooked to perfection and server was outstanding.  Wife and I had steaks which were awesome, daughter had the cedar plank salmon that she loved and my son had a creole pasta dish which he liked.  Awesome time.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My server Shanice made this a great visit. she was friendly and well on point. Oh and the food was good too!"}
{"text":"Tonight we went to O'Charley's for dinner and for a restaurant that has only been open for 2 days there wasn't an empty table in the house. And for good reason, as it turns out, because the food was worth the stop. I had to pass on the fresh yeast rolls brought to the table as I have a Gluten Allergy, but the warm rolls smelled amazing (and my family couldn't get enough). They don't have a separate gluten free menu, but if you go onto their website, each dish has a list of allergens, so it was easy to pick the meals I could eat. I started with the Nashville Hot Deviled Eggs, the waitress had to check if I can have the sauce drizzled on top, and unfortunately had to forgo the sauce as it contained gluten. But I'm glad I ordered them as they were the perfect combo of pickled vegetables and creamy egg yolk. I chose the full order of baby back ribs in their tangy sauce (comes with 2 sides) as my main entree and I wasn't disappointed with the melt off the bone meat. We were too full to order their desert (and there aren't any gluten free options), but my sister took a slice of their caramel pie home. There are lots of pie options so save some room if you can. The drink menu definitely has a southern influence and I can't wait to try the front porch punch. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. So if you like good food with some southern charm, give O'Charley's a try."}
{"text":"Wow just walked into Ol Charley's. FIRST there was no Greeter we waited looked around , then headed to the bar. SECOND the bar itself was DIRTY had not been cleaned and I waited for about 5 minutes and NO NO NO Bartender ( I could have gone behind the bar and made my own drink). So, apparently after staying away 3 years because of bad service and sub par food has NOT improved. When I tell you I will not be back, I mean it. I thought it would have improved and I felt they needed a 2nd chance. There will not be a 3rd and if i could give a minus 5 stars I would."}
{"text":"i patronized this establishment on Saturday, March 08, 2014.  There rolls are hot, sweet and endless. There was nothing more that I found enjoyable about my meal.  The dinner salads are nothing more than various lettuces.  The bleu cheese dressing was not good at all.  It was mayo based and very strong.  I ordered a combo with steak and in lieu of chicken tender I requested it with cod.  I was told the cost would be an additional $1.00.  That is fine.  However I was charged for steak and salmon, which I would consider salmon to be a much more costly meal.  I only received 1 piece of fish, which was fried and cut into 3 pieces.  it was very very dry and hard.  The remaining 3 people in my party ordered fish and chips.  Of these 3 people 2 of them also received dry hard fish.  On my prior visit I left with the same feeling.  I only went back because I feel every establishment can have an off day.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ESTABLISHMENT TO ANYONE."}
{"text":"I have to say o'charlies was definitely a pleasant surprise. The manager Keon gave my wife and I the royal treatment and the waiter really knew the menu very well. At the waiters suggestion we had the Louisiana sirloin definitely delicious. All in all very good experience."}
{"text":"Awesome services and food love the staff so nice and friendly and the new managers are awesome as well i will be returning there as much as possible philly always waits on us and she is very good with the kids"}
{"text":"The food was meh...nothing special there. If you get pie, expect it to come right out of the refrigerator. The kitchen staff messed my order up even though the ticket was put in correct."}
{"text":"I am stunned & almost in shock over my experience at this O'charleys.  Now that I have taken the time to read the other reviews, I get it & I am amazed this place is still open.  While dining, a roach, yes you read correctly, a ROACH was crawling up the wall beside me.  If this wasn't bad enough the responses from the waitress, manager and regional or district manager who happened to be there was worse than the roach.  The waitress, I understand because they have no authority, they can only get the manager.  Her response was, I am sorry, but I am not getting it, what do you want me to do.  We said get the manager, the manager had the audacity to  explain that it wasn't a roach because they just had someone come in and say that they did not have any bugs.  She then asked, what would you like me to do because it looks like you are finished eating.  I had half a plate of food on the table & my drink.  Since it appeared that she was not even going to offer to move us, we asked if she could get the critter off the wall.  She proceeded to kill the roach in a napkin and examined it in front of us, I guess to prove it wasn't a roach.  I thought I was going to lose my dinner.  When we expressed that her response was unacceptable, she proceeded to get the District Manager.  Would you believe the grumpy woman came to our table as if we were keeping her from doing something much more important & gave the same exact rhetoric, offering to show documentation that they were told they have no bugs.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  Please pay attention to this important fact, she said they have no control over bugs coming into the restaurant from the outside with doors that open and close.  Again we were asked, what do you want me to do.  Then she proceeded to say in a very confrontational way, that we obviously had in our minds what we expected her to do. Then said, I guess you don't want to pay for your meals, if that's what you want then fine have a good night and she stomped away.  I wouldn't buy dog food from a place that demonstrated this type of attitude & lack of concern for their environment & customers.  Good luck to anyone who chooses to dine at this establishment.  I hope your stomach can handle the extra protein."}
{"text":"we have gave this location many chances, but will not be returning after our last time there.To say the food was bad would be like saying that bad was edible.It felt like I flusked $35.00 BUCKS down the toliet.My chicken sand. had no meat ,just a piece of hard fryied skin and my mom's club sand. had no bacon and the bread had been burnt black and then hid on the inside.When you dare to complain they acted like your wanting something for free,when all we want is food that we can eat.Took both home in boxs ,and from there to the garbage.I'm tired of spending money for food that is so bad I can't even eat it."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant they have a good variety. I highly recommend spinach artichokes, prime rib, black an blue salad is espectacular and customer service is awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Excessive salt is the key to taste here. My last order was to go. The potato toppings and dressings came in little containers. The ranch had lettuce floating around in there and I'm not sure what was in the sour cream. Very fatty steak, mediocre is a polite way to describe the service from the bar and the food."}
{"text":"The food was great, as usual. It came in a timely manner. On the other hand, this was the worst service I have received in a very long time. Our additional guest who came later on was never offered a beverage. We never got our refills again with our drinks or rolls. And to top it off she just came and dropped the check on our table without saying a word or asking if we needed anything else. I have been a waitress, and this is not how you treat your customers. It was a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Brunch was wonderful!  Our server Alyssa was very efficient and had great suggestions.  Our family will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've never been to O charleys before now and I probably wont ever go back. I wish I could say it was just the staff that was rude. But it was also the food. Steak was undercooked and so was chicken. Mashed potatoes were crusty? How's that even possible. And then to top it off we had trouble with the bill. The manager was friendly and apologized. Look elsewhere before settling on this resturant."}
{"text":"Walked in and seated myself at the bar after barely being acknowledged by the staff, 2pm Friday. After 15 minutes at the bar - where 3 other customers were eating - and still no offer of a glass of water, I found a server and asked if the bar was still being serviced. His response \"yeah well, it gets kinda busy in here boss man\"
Wow! 
His name is Geoff. He's quite horrible at the basics of the restaurant industry and customer service. 
I just got to the area doing remodels with my crew on some houses for about the next 3 months. I thought this would be our lunch spot. I can very much say none of us will ever be returning. 
Explain that to your \"boss man\" Geoff."}

{"text":"In town training at Kings Mountain for work and a few of us have been here twice this week. Great food, cold beer and great service. Thanks for the belly ache everything was so good we ate to much and free pie Wednesday why the hell not :)"}
{"text":"Went here last week. Their draught beer was hot so they quit selling it. Went back 3 days later and the problem was not fixed yet so I walked out this time and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We came into town after a long day of driving. After checking into the hotel we needed a good meal. O'Charley's was the choice because of the variety. You have to come here! The food is great. The service is better! The bartender, Latoya (Toya)is top notch. Our food arrived fast and piping hot. 

Overall if you want a melt in your mouth prime rib, delicious seafood, and veggies cooked...just so; visit O'Charley's."}
{"text":"Two times I have done takeout. Not sure what they are doing in the kitchen. I got a cheeseburger and instead of the cheddar cheese on it, I asked for swiss. I get my order and it was nicely wrapped in tin foil. To my surprise I am missing a BOTTOM bun to my order. Not sure how you forget that with a cheeseburger. Also I asked for swiss as I stated above and got CHEDDAR on it topped with melted swiss. The whole point was to get a different cheese not add on. Service inside isn't bad. But takeout and the cooks don't seem to be knowing what they are doing."}
{"text":"Decided to have a family lunch here around 1 pm on a Saturday. We were welcomed when we first walked in and had a small wait of 5 minutes for our table. 

The server grabbed our drink order,  returned with our drinks and took our order. The rolls weren't brought out in a reasonable amount of time,  but they were delightful when we got them. She never refilled our drinks. Never offered another basket of rolls. Service could have been way better.

I asked for my burger to be cooked medium. It was totally overcooked. I couldn't tell my server in a reasonable amount of time because she didn't check up on us to see how everything tasted. Also,  the burger had almost no bacon on it. 

When I told the server about the burger being over cooked she didn't take my plate to notify the kitchen right away. Instead she said that she would grab her manager. Five minutes went by. I ended up eating half my husbands meal because eating with little kids puts you on a time restriction,  and we didn't have time to wait for a new burger to be cooked. 

The manager was very polite and she was willing to give us a slice of pie. We didn't take her offer because little kids were fussy and ready to go. 

Oh,  and there menu says homemade lemonade. So I ordered a strawberry lemonade and it's not what I expected. It was carbonated -  not classic homemade."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Sunday brunch just yesterday.
I am not a big fan of chain restaurants like this, yet i relented to our youngest's desire for the free rolls.    Service was prompt and not intrusive.  I had the prime rib omelet (a little overcooked) with asparagus and mushrooms while others had a burger and fries and roast beef sandwich lunch.  All in all, a quick easy meal near all the shopping you can imagine."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed a wonderful father's day dinner here recently!
The first thing I have to say is the rolls are incredible! Best rolls ever! I love the rolls that this restaurant makes. They set the stage for delicious food.
We ordered our food and it was all prepared perfectly and brought to our table in a timely matter. I like that there was a variety of choices available for us. They make huge healthy salads made with creativity. There were savory steaks. Delicious sandwiches with fries or other sides to choose from. I really liked the option to order breakfast too. Sunday brunch is so fun!
Overall we had a great time as a family! 
Most importantly though we were able to give our father a memory that he will have forever. I am truely happy that we chose this restaurant to host his father's day celebration!"}
{"text":"This place could be a lot worse, that's for sure.  The building structure and decor promise something akin to TGIF but the waitstaff makes a huge difference.  The food is a little more ritzy, shying away from the goofy food puns in item names and sticking strictly to describing the food.  But once again we have a melange of basic dishes that anyone else can make. Too put it succinctly, it's a place my grandparents love."}
{"text":"Just left this O Charleys for an early lunch after a night of drinking. 
I was wowed by the customer service from start to finish. 
We were welcomed and sat by a nice lady with short blonde hair and was taken care of by Brittany (I\"m pretty sure that was her name, I had a long night...) . 
Brittany was very friendly with southern charm. 
Complimentary rolls were brought out with our sweet teas.
An order of nachos, two drinks, two meals and a dessert sampler only set me back $35. 
Too much food to eat, so we packed up left overs for dinner. 
The club sandwich is delicious and my bf had no complaints about the chicken tender sandwich. He had his buffalo style... this item has been discontinued, but the staff with gladly oblige if they have the buffalo sauce. 
My only complaints are that our drinks couldhave been re filled a little quicker and a pet peeve of mine is putting lemon in my drink without asking. I know this is a little too picky, but I do not enjoy lemon in my sweet tea and absolutely hate the seeds that tend to gravitate towards the bottom. A quick question asking if I would like lemon would remedy this problem, although I guess I could say \"no lemon\" when I order. 
Love this place. Ask for Brittany."}
{"text":"Three of the party had prime rib, it was OK just not real special. Baked potatoes were on the edge of old very tough near the peel. Service was prompt for what was I'm sure a rather busy New Year's eve."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of O'Charley's but this place probably had the worst service I've experienced from this chain restaurant. We arrived here before the lunch crowd and just finding a seat was a debacle. The place was barely empty and the hostess had trouble finding an open table. The facility looked unclean, blinds had dust and guck on them, the service staff clothes were dirty and weren't concerned on the way they looked. 

The drink orders came out wrong and the food came out on the verge of cold. Service was slower than average for a chain restaurant and the atmosphere was uninviting. I'm making a point of not stopping at this O'charley's again."}
{"text":"Our experience was less than lack luster tonight. Our server seemed to lack experience and was not attentive or expedient. Our food was just okay. The restaurant was dirty (there was a pile of dessert sitting on the floor that was not cleaned at all during our visit). Highly unlikely we will be returning."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly. Unfortunately, the waitress told us that the receptionist triple sat her. ?? I guess she had too many tables to wait on now. I told her that was fine. Well, it took about 40 minutes to get our meal. A few items that warranted my low rating were a gnat in my water, the extremely long time to get our meal and my steak, though tasty, was cooked well instead of the medium that I ordered. 
Overall, I guess I am rating my \"experience\" at this restaurant low. Maybe on a different night, with a different staff, my experience would have been better. 
I would note that the yeast rolls were really good and the waitress was apologetic."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in tonight looking for a couple drinks while we waited on our hubbies to join us. Our server was a very nice wo.en who was obviously stretched beyond her limits. My friend and I chatted for a while, order3d a couple of drinks. The Strawberry margarita was so sweet I had to exchange it for a house margarita. Once our husbands got there, we had to wait so long so had to pay for our drinks and leave. This was NOT our servers fault. She was wonderful. But, she had been assigned a whole room. She had 7 or 8 tables. How crazy! Talk about set to g your people up for failure. The manager came over towards us as we were throwing our cash on the table. I told him it looked like our server was assigned the whole room, and h3 confirmed it. I told him it was too much, and he acted a little surprised. I'm sorry, but how so you expect quality service when she has 6 tables? Give me a break. He asked if he could bring us anything before we left. REALLY?! Where were you whole she was in the weeds? When we were looking for drinks and she was bussing her own tables? Ugh. I'm glad we left."}
{"text":"Service is delivered with warmth and pizazz. Always prepared to perfection. Tilapia was unbelievable with spice and preparation. You will get the nest meal and the greatest service at O'Charleys at University Charlotte."}
{"text":"To be straightforward the best thing I had here was their rolls. The tea wasn't sweet for anything and even 6 sugar packets didn't help. Sweet potatoes weren't even sweet. Tasted like plain mashed potatoes with food coloring. I am far from satisfied but my kids were satisfied with their meals so that's something."}
{"text":"great food. great menu variety and prices. puts competitors like applebees and tgi fridays to shame. always friendly staff and clean environment. the hostess angie has always been nice and friendly carries on conversation. she gives a great first impression. we go to O'charleys on average of 2 times per month or more. happy hour is everyday 2-6 with half price appetizers. everything ive tried has been great tasting. from appetizers to entrees, burgers, steak, desserts and even the mixed drink specials. their parent company owns a high end steakhouse and they use the same steak here. pretty sad when the steak here has been better tasting and prepared just the way we like it, while high end steak places have messed up orders and have had to be sent back. never had a complaint on the food or staff. would recommend to anyone to give this place a try. the only possible bad thing is that they dont have more locations."}
{"text":"The staff here is AMAZING. The food was delicious. Very prompt service and SO friendly. The manager I believe his name was Ryan was awesome he came around to check on our food and was so willing to make sure we were satisfied. Our server Brooklyn was one of the best ever. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I would recommend this O'Charley's, the manager Hannah was wonderful and a gracious host when we had a mistake in our take out order.  Enjoy this spot for the great customer service all the way around....and the food is very tasteful.....especially the catfish."}
{"text":"Food is definitely good although a few times I have seen people get food under/over cooked. Chicken fingers are phenomenal along with the bread rolls they give you. Service definitely could be better but they get you a seat and your food so at least they're going what they're supposed to. Awesome place, always want to go there."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We had a huge party and they were very accommodating and our food came out quick and it was correct!!!"}
{"text":"Never been to an O Charley's in my life and never will after going here today. Rolls were good and that's the best I can say about this place. Everything came out BURNT. The chicken pot pie I ordered was burned and so was my girlfriends Tuscan chicken. Atmosphere was lame and so were the servers. Plain Jane central. This restaurant seemed to be on the outs based on what I saw. Don't go here. There are so many similar restaurants in the area that do such a better job."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Great server but terrible food. Steak and burgers were undercooked. Food was cold when brought to us. Could have spent a $70 family dinner in a much better restaurant. Restaurant smelled terrible. Been to other O'Charleys and this one is the worst by far."}
{"text":"worst experience EVER! DON'T waste your money or time

My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night around 7:30 because we never been and wanted to give it a shot, we get seated and about 10 minutes go by and we still have not been greeted to give our drink order and it was not even busy. we finally get greeted and we receive our bread about 3 min later . we order chicken strips and spinach artichoke dip. we get our food and everything was warm, not hot at all, When i go to a restaurant i expect hot food., I ordered the Tuscan chicken and when it came to the table , it looked like crap, nothing like the picture , not even close. The cream sauce was broken and very oily the chicken was overcooked, and once again , it wasn't even hot, and looked like the did not even care about presentation. The waiter drops the check off and it was almost $50 and after that I get fed up,  we were not going to be  paying for this crappy food and crappy service, we  go to the manager and complain and just end up paying for my boyfriend food. worst first experience and will not be coming back ever, terrible food and lame service"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years. It was always mediocre, but today it was horrible. Everything  was so bland. We came here for lunch for my moms birthday. We all ordered the trio appetizer but instead we had double chicken tenders and \"mozzarella wedges\". Yuck!!! 

The chicken tenders were over cooked and taste like frozen chicken tenders. The mozzarella wedges were not all they way mozzarella but a cheddar mix which was very nasty. It was plain as hell. My 3 year had 2 over cooked chicken tenders with a few fries on her plate.

The waiter was rushing everything so fast that she couldn't even bring drinks on time. It was a waste of my $24.00 I will not be back again EVER!"}
{"text":"food good.  service great.  it is a chain.  for a chain they do a good job.  they also mix a VERY GOOD martini.  their sunday brunch is very good."}
{"text":"I gave one star because I could not figure out how to give ZERO.
Sorry Charlie but this place just doesn't cut the mustard.

The first time, I figured it was just bad luck and timing.  

The second time, I made the excuse that it was Sunday and the church crowd had over powered the staff and held them hostage.

The last time, I came to the conclusion this place sucks.

My wife says I should tell you how I really feel about the place.  I don't think it would be appropriate for a mixed audience."}
{"text":"Hostesses were very friendly as soon as we walked in. I had a peach margarita something belle! I cannot remember the full name. It was delicious! Crab cakes were yummy not greasy! Bavarian pretzels very good and I loved the cheese and honey mustard sauce. Both were mild. We had pork chop dinners it was huge! My friend had pie and coffee and she said it was super fresh cup of joe and HOT! Great servers! Its more of a family restaurant than a bar but drinks were great! Dinner rolls YUM! I would def go back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner with my fiance about 9 ordered an appetizer salad two steaks took 20 minutes get the appetizer took 40 minutes to get our state no excuse. We usually come here about once a month if not two or three times every time it seems to get worse and worse don't know if I will be back"}
{"text":"This is an average chain restaurant.  Think Applebees with a different name.  The only thing that stands out about this place is that they did not run my credit card and \"manually entered\" it 2-3 months after I went there.  I had to dig through old receipts to determine if it was a a fraudulent transaction or not.  It was not, but what kind of business doesn't run a credit card for several months?  Seems shady on the operations level."}
{"text":"I've had several poor experiences at this restaurant. The first was when our server Lamar went AWOL for about 20-25 minutes between check ins. I called and told the manager about our experience and he knew exactly who we were. Why didn't he do something proactive? Your guess is as good as mine. He invited us back to make it right. The server that time spilled a tray full or drinks on myself and my infant daughter. 

The food is good, happy hour pricing and pie nights are cool too but my family and I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food here is good......... Once it comes!!!! Aghhhhhh. It's always a pain coming here.  Always. It's never changed since they've opened. And their managers just make excuses. 
Like-- get it together!! And admit you have issues. Don't make excuses. Make it right. 
There was a 5 top, 3 top and a 2 top seated at least 10-15 mins after us that got their food and was leaving even BEFORE we got served. We waited over an hour to get our entrees. 
And then I said to the manager about the wait and that's when he started making excuses...... The dining room is cleared out and he's telling me the kitchen gets \"backed up\".... My food was cold , one lady got served an over done steak.....
Well. This is the only reason I don't come here. It's always the same.
Being a former owner, and knowing the staff they have. There's no excuse for the wait time. None.  
Take it as you want it."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and two children, and everything we ordered was absolutely AWFUL. Everything was tasted terrible. Steak, burger, mac and cheese, soup, bread... all was extremely poor quality and on the verge of being spoiled. Never, ever again."}
{"text":"New orleans cajun chicken pasta was pretty good. Very creamy. Could have used a little more tang. The grilled chicken was very flavorful. Quite a few of the menu options seemed appetizing. Prices are pretty decent as well. Good portion size."}
{"text":"Very poor service, we where sat down and no body wanted to take our drink order or even ask if we have been helped. Very bad experience especially on Father's Day. We choose to leave after 30 mins. The bad part was, it was no busy at all."}
{"text":"Better than average for a chain.  We go here because of my gluten-free friend.  O'C's has a GF menu, which makes her feel oh, so special.  If it weren't for her, we'd be going to a momandpop place.  Not a fan of chains."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love going here. It's our go to for date night. Contrary to most people's opinions, the service is always amazing. The food is always delicious and if not, they take it back and are more than happy to get something else. Love love love this place"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before with no problems.  I went in just to get a side salad and the coconut drink from the bar.  I went to the bar the bartender said nothing... finally I was like I'm ready to order.  I was telling her my simple order but some other customer who she must have been waiting on before I arrived kept interrupting asking questions and she would just leave me and attend to him... and he was looking at me as if to be doing this out of spite.  I just got up and left.  She should have said one moment sir I will be right with you.  My order was simple and quick."}
{"text":"I like this place.   I have eaten here a few times for lunch.  Service was good and fast. Free pie Wednesday's is great... I always get the Apple pie. The fried chicken is very flavorful and the rolls are a crime they are so good.  The side salads are good as well.  I like the combination of the chicken with the mashed sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch with a friend who treated me for my birthday. Been here before and decided to try something I had never had---Prime Rib Pasta. Well, folks (and head honchos of O'Charley's) you had to use a flashlight to find any prime rib in the dish. Yes, it was tasty but how can you call this dish by that name when there are only two half dollar size pieces of thinly shaved meat in the dish?  Also, the menu says there are mushrooms and asparagus in it---I did have asparagus but found only one mushroom!  Come on now, you folks can do better. On the plus side, we had a great waitress, Donna, who is outgoing and more than helpful. I would like to come back one more time to try and give you a five star rating."}
{"text":"Super nice staff and the prices are pretty good.  However, the $4 margarita on Sunday are really week and taste weird.  I would not recommend ordering one.  I had 2 and they both were weak and weird.

I love the twisted chips & Queso.

I had the wedge salad with grilled chicken and the chicken was really good and had a little bit of spiciness to it."}
{"text":"Just ok. Not a fan of the seasoning that makes their unique taste. Been a few times to try a couple different items, and it's all just ok."}
{"text":"First time for our family at this chain.  Very busy on a Sunday at 1pm.  As a party of 5, we waited approximately 20 minutes on a table as there are few tables accomodating more than 4 people.  The hostess was apologetic. When I inquired about an unoccupied 6-topper, I was nicely informed that it was reserved (despite that fact they don't take reservations, so far as I know).  Once seated, it took 10 minutes to get drinks and rolls. The kids had $1 smoothies, which I thought were a pretty good deal.  Our order was taken promptly, but it took an inoordinate amount of time to begin getting our food, which came 2 dishes at a time over a span of perhaps 15 minutes. Not something I find to be acceptable in any dining establishment.  Our waitress was very apologetic, almost to the point of being intrusive.  Another waitress offered up her story, which played the wait staff against the kitchen, as if that should either interest or concern us.  The manager made a stop and was midly apologetic but offered nothing for our trouble.  The food was all nicely presented, hot and well prepared, and that's why they get three stars.  My daughter's steak was on the money.  My wifes cedar plank salmon and mashed potatoes were well received, as was the mac-n-cheese and corn dog bites by the youngr kids.  I would not be inclined to return based on what seemed to be an inability of the kitchen to manage its traffic; and that to me is pretty fundamental."}
{"text":"i dont know why i continue to go here there is always a problem when i dine in most of the waiters have attitudes and when i get to go my order is wrong"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a large party and was there for a birthday dinner...
A few of our guests went to the bar for a \"celebratory drink\" while they finished getting our table ready. It was impossible to pay the tab and took two people going back and forth because neither of the two bartenders or other staff that were just standing there looking at us could recognize that us standing UP at the bar (with money in hand), walking away (trying to let friends know what was going on), coming back and standing there again meant that we were ready to pay (our party was being seated)!
Steak was excellent! Food took FOREVER to come out and in three separate trips (not including salads or apps) FYI... When you bring extra rolls you don't bring the same amount as Pre-dinner rolls, too many! They threw away half that were still on the table and brought more!..? Second round of Broccoli that came out was way too hard! Ok experience overall."}
{"text":"Had the nicest waitress last time I ate here.  She was very helpful and personable.  Food is pretty good.  I had a pretty tasty burger last time.  I had the fish and chips before that.  Mondays are great because their premium on-tap beer is very cheap (something like $2 for a tall glass).  Not bad."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks for a great price.  I've yet to taste something bad here.  I love their giant salads and delicious desserts.  I'm definitely becoming a regular.  Try the appetizer sampler and orange citrus  margaritas.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Set me out Brunt food left real bad taste in my mouth.i would think they would take some pride in their cooking!"}
{"text":"Worst O'Charley's I have ever been to! 

My boyfriend and I got to O'Charley's at around 7:30 on a Tuesday evening. We walked in and there was no hostess at the door so we sat ourselves at a table in the bar area. We sat there for about 10 minutes before the hostess came by with some menus and said the bartender would be right with us. After about 5 minutes the bartender came by and she got our drink orders, which were 2 waters, she brought those then walked away and didn't say she would be back to get our order. She never came back and she wasn't busy. Maybe 4 people at the bar and one other table.

We went to the hostess stand and asked if we could be sat with a server. She sat us with Ashley who was great and took care of us. She is the ONLY reason this place gets 2 stars. We ordered chicken tenders and they were almost inedible. Completely over fried, hard, and dry. I will most definitely not be back to this O'Charley's."}
{"text":"Like Chili's and TGIFriday's, O'Charley's is a casual sitdown restaurant chain.  Unlike Chili's and TGIFriday's, O'Charley's menu options leave a little something to be desired.  Granted, we didn't have one of their dinner entrees; we went for lunch and ordered from their \"lunch combo\" menu which consists of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I ordered the Caesar salad and \"overloaded\" potato soup.  I'm not sure what the soup was overloaded with.  Calories, maybe?  Preservatives?  It certainly wasn't jam-packed with ingredients.  There were some slices of potato and some pieces of chopped bacon, but they looked sparse sitting in the thin, somewhat-cheesy, creamed soup base.  It looked and tasted like it was fresh...out of a can.  If that's your \"signature\" soup, wouldn't you want people to rave about it?  The Caesar salad was pretty average, too.  It's hard to make a Caesar salad bad, though.  But you can \"wow\" it by having thick creamy full-of-flavor dressing instead of the runny, bland stuff.   So, basically, everything was just very average.  The service was great, though.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  But that's not enough to bring me back for lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this place and I must say very good food. The servers was very polite and making sure you were OK. I would go back to this place again. Must visits place to eat if in Concord NC."}
{"text":"Great food! They start you out with bread and it is absolutely melt in your mouth good. I got the NEW ORLEANS CAJUN CHICKEN PASTA, while my husband got O'CHARLEY'S FAMOUS CHICKEN TENDERS & FRIES. Both were absolutely delicious. The temperature was good, the pasta sauce was creamy with a little heat. Both the tenders and the chicken on my pasta were juicy and flavorful. Definitely a place we would go to again. The service was friendly and quick. They were attentive to refilling drinks and replacing appetizer bread."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 15 people this past Friday.  The food was good, nothing horrible or outstanding.  Prices were good too.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly.  Service was good.  I would come back again if I come thru Ohio again"}
{"text":"The food at this location is always good. The service is hit or miss. Tonight was a miss. 
The negatives:  We needed just a moment after getting drinks to decide on our order and within a minute or two we'd closed our menus to indicate readiness.  It took the Waitress about 6 minutes to come back to take the order.  

During the salad course we received the only tea refill we'd get of the evening; from the halfway point of the meal, my husband did not have anything to drink. We tried to flag her down but she wasn't looking our way as she came out to the floor.  

After the meal was over, it took about 15 minutes to get the check and ask for to go boxes. There was also no offer of dessert. We both had meals that had sauce or au jus but no containers for it or of it came with the to go boxes. 

The positives: Food was good. Manager did swing by to ask about things right as we received our meal and it was speedy enough and well-timed between salads and entree. 

We do like the food and the atmosphere so maybe we'll go back but it'll be further down the list as the last 2 out of 3 times were poor service times."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I haven't been able to eat solid food for awhile because of a stomach issue. I started back about a week and a half ago. This was my first steak in about two months. I don't know if that is the reason but the steak was soooooo good and the margarita was absolutely delicious. I'm going back next Tuesday to make sure. No joke. Lol"}
{"text":"I went here for my son's birthday, the service was good.  A little disappointed they don't sing happy birthday.  Also the kid's meals are small, my 8 year old son was still hungry!  I ordered the prime rib pasta, generous portion, made two meals."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice and polite, food was not hot. Baked potato was hard, cold, cheese was asked but it wouldn't even melt. The steak was tough for Med well had to wait on 2nd side item... broccoli and it came out cold. Very very small portions. Rolls were good. Wasn't pleased with food at all. Quality in food has definitely declined. Others at table had drizzle fried chicken and they liked it. Salmon also was ordered and not too good was the remarks of. Cooked to long but sat apparently because it wasn't hot."}
{"text":"UPDATE!!! The brunch items here are all very good however I think the best deal if you are really hungry is the Overloaded Brunch Platter! It comes with a 6oz sirloin, two eggs, three slices of bacon and a half waffle! Everything is just so delicious! The steak and eggs are cooked to order however you chose and the waffle is light and flaky! 

Add a made from scratch strawberry lemonade and I can guarantee an outstanding meal!"}
{"text":"I've gone to O'Charley's with family or friends probably half a dozen times. Unfortunately, I cannot say they've been consistent. I've had my share of enjoyable experiences, disasters and everything in between. Whenever I've had bad experience, management has always taken care of it. While I appreciate this, they're just putting a bandaid on a bullet hole and hoping it fixes things. 

During my last visit, we were seated, and waited about 10 minutes before any server showed to our table. They came, took our drink orders, and were off again for another 10 minutes. During this time, I noticed that just about every page of my menu was extremely sticky, and I opted to go with the usual. Unfortunately, I decided to deviate on the sides and get some mac n cheese. The cheese shredded on top both looked and tasted like melted plastic. My mom ordered a baked potato for her side and said it was cold and hard. I did like that they left us with plenty of delicious, hot rolls and a butter for each person. Once they returned, our order was taken, and that's when the real party began (assuming you consider waiting over 45 minutes for 3 people's food and seeing your server a whopping 1 time a party.) 

When our food did finally come, one of the burgers didn't arrive, as it was apparently dropped on the long journey to our table. This was when we informed our server we needed to place a To go order. At this point, the manager came over and informed us she would be taking the burger off the bill, and we greatly appreciated it. After this, we were told 2-3 times that it would be just another minute on the burger. When it finally did come, it was made wrong. Since it was free, and to save us all the grief of waiting any longer, they ate it as it was. By now, we were all glad to be done as we hadn't planned on spending over an hour and a half at this restaurant. Still yet, it was far from over as the take out order STILL was not ready, and would not be ready for another 10 minutes. 

At the end of the day, the manager discounted our meal by 50% and we finally left. I can't say whether I'll be back to O'Charley's or not... it's not a bad place, just severely disorganized and run by leaders who believe that change is not the answer, but discounts will fix everything."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY disappointed in O'Charley's. You don't expect to be \"wow\"ed by such a large chain, but they should certainly have their act together. 

First off nobody in the restaurant, from the disorganised hostess stand to the waitstaff, seemed to be more than 16 years old. Do we need 3 hostesses for a Saturday night? Perhaps, but the seating area was mostly empty. I'm not sure what they were doing there. 

Our waiter started off strong, but after taking our order, he seemed to disappear. We were out of bread and needing refills on drinks long before he showed up to check on us again. 

When our food came out, we were warned that literally every single plate (including kids' meals) was \"really hot\", and it was true. Having worked in the industry a long time, I can tell you that plates that hot are indicative of one thing only- your food sat in the prep window under heat lamps for a LONG time before anyone bothered to run it to your table. 

Sure enough, out of the 6 adults present, 2 ordered steaks (medium rare and medium)- both came out medium well-well done. 3 of us had ordered the asparagus as a side, which they actually charge EXTRA for, and it was so overdone it was completely inedible. 

Here's a hint, if you try to cut asparagus and you can't even cut it because it is so mushy and stringy, it's NOT something you should serve paying customers. Much less charge them extra. 

Out of the kids' meals, I have some of the least picky kids in the world, but my son hardly touched his mac and cheese. He pronounced it \"really gross\", but maybe he's been spoiled by restaurants that don't serve what looks like knockoff Velveeta.  

I will say that after our waiter finally came around to check on us (drinks empty again)- he did send the manager over and the manager did choose to remove the upcharges for asparagus from our check. I consider that to be in the \"should\" category, however, so no extra points for that. 

The waiter was nice enough to offer us free dessert, which the kids took him up on, so we took home a bag of their fresh \"donuts\". They enjoyed them as breakfast the next morning. 

I would honestly usually give 1 star for how bad this experience was. Perhaps if they were busy, I'd understand, but considering how few other tables there were in the restaurant, I just can't wrap my mind around it. I'm bumping it up to 2 stars simply because I think they can do better. It's not our server's fault if the food was overcooked BEFORE it sat overlong in the window, and I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt; and the manager DID try to help us, although it was too little too late to save the meal. 

I won't be going back here, but I'm sure they can do a better job in future."}
{"text":"In the past year, service and food quality have decreased dramatically. Left a majority of my food on the plate today as it tasted freezer burned and like it had been under a heat lamp for an extended period. Instead of a \"sorry\", i got that they would discount the bill. I didn't want a discount, rather I wanted food that was palatable; but I wasn't given the opportunity. Server was terrible on numerous levels; but the worst part was that I had to eat a majority of my rolls and appetizer off of my napkin because he did not bring plates. Carry out server was very helpful and apologetic (she brought food because her section was slow); unfortunately it couldn't make up for the train wreck that happened before she came. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Weekend's R for Lovers.....Prime Rib lovers that is! O'CHARLEY'S best Prime Rib in town!"}
{"text":"First time visitor...LOVED the catfish(YUM) also good atmosphere and a great server named Brook...GOOD food...GOOD price...GOOD service...will be back!"}
{"text":"The service is so slow here that last time we went there we didn't even eat our food at the table. We asked our server to just box it up and that took an additional 10 after we told her we needed to leave. We waited for 40 mins. This is the second time we have had awful service at this location. There won't be a third."}
{"text":"I had the Sirloin steak which was pretty awesome.  I go to a lot of expensive steakhousess and the steak that I got at O'Charley's was just as good.  Trying to eat healthier these days so I passed on the warm bread.  The broccoli and baked potato were both hot, which I like quite a bit."}
{"text":"Our first visit here will most likely be our last.  I had checked out the menu online, and it looked pretty extensive.  Once we got there, a lot of the menu items that I saw online were not on the actual menu at all.  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, but the food took entirely too long to come out, and the person who served us (think she was the shift manager) had no idea who got what, and didn't bother to ask, just started setting things down where she thought they should go, which was weird.  I got the crab cake dinner with collards.  I was not at all impressed with the crab cakes.  They were pretty bland and not a little crispy, as I like them, and the collards were not my cup of tea.......too much vinegar or something.  The other two people I was with got burgers, and holy cow.......the \"Classic Cheeseburger\" had like half a head of lettuce on it, with some thick slices of red onion, and three or four thick deli-style pickle slices.  The guy who ordered it ended up taking most of it off, because he could barely fit it in his mouth!  

My boyfriend and I may come back to try some drinks and appetizers, but overall, I think it was way too pricey for what they are offering."}
{"text":"After we waited 40 mins for 2 plates of prime rib and two pasta plates,we're told sorry we got slammed and it was before 6 on a Saturday night.prime rib was very thin and fatty. We're not offered desert  usually  food is descent. Very disappointed  tonight."}
{"text":"Meagan was awesome.Went out of her way to have cook make sone pepper steak soup even when it wasn't available.brought food out in a timely manner.was quick to get refills and clear dirty dishes off the table.excellent service!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for lunch on a Wednesday. Wednesday's at O'Charley's happen to be free pie Wednesday! You can pick a slice of pie with your meal or take it to go. They have all different types of pies to choose from including caramel, apple and peach. 

For my meal I got the grown up grilled cheese and a bowl of the tortilla soup. The grilled cheese had 4 types of cheese, bacon, and tomato, all on buttered texas toast. The tortilla soup was very good but not very hot. 

I got the grilled cheese without the tomato, and it definitely did not disappoint on cheese. The Texas Toast was a little much bread, and super filling. 

The waiter was patient with our large group, but sometimes would disappear for a period of time. Overall the service and quality I have come to expect from O'Charleys."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Tried some of their new items and they were fantastic. Management was very attentive when we were there.  They were continuously helping the wait staff and making for a fast and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Lunch to go from O'Charleys was absolutely wonderful. I work in the same plaza so I called in my order for pick up. I ordered the loaded baked potato and broccoli which was only about $6. I drove right over there and the food was hot and ready within five minutes. The food tasted great. Best loaded baked potato I ever had. Will definitely be catching lunch there more often."}
{"text":"Went here for the advertised prime rib; very poor cut of meat, not to mention poor service.  Either they didn't have enough staff or they were just inept; we had to remind our waitress numerous times for bread, drinks, etc.  We really felt bad for customers next to ours who sat waiting for their food the entire time we were seated.  Lastly, they don't give you a full 1/2 rack of ribs; very limited portion.  It will be a long time before we come back; there are plenty of other options available with better food and service."}
{"text":"The Bacon burger was dry and I got no refills! The waitress was good but not very atitive."}
{"text":"this is one of our favorite places to eat.  kicks the crap out of TGI Fridays and Applebees both of which are completely disgusting.  Food is a great price and they offer half price appetizers 2-6 EVERY DAY even weekends.  Makes it worth it.  We can get two appetizers and two complete entrees and leave over stuffed and for around $30. They are always sending 20% off coupons too if you sign up for their email list.  We get GE giftcards and get the fuel perks then use it at the restaurant . Servers are usually great.  Hostess at the front door - younger blonde girl - is always so nice and accommodating and friendly.  Never had a bad meal here.  Food is really tasty and comes out quick. One time we experienced a problem where our appetizers came out exactly when our food did but the manager promptly took them off our bill. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a business trip out to Charlotte, NC.  I'm from California, so I had no idea what to expect when we went here for a quick bite to eat.  

This place is situated in the middle of a shopping plaza-like setting.  We were seated promptly, however, there were 6 people in our party and we had to squeeze in to a table that normally fits 4 comfortably.  They do have a decent menu with normal lunch items you would find at any chain restaurant.  Wait staff was polite. Food on the other hand was mediocre and a bit on the greasy side.  

Overall it was a fast lunch, nothing really special but also nothing really awful.  I'd suggest though that if you're looking for a nice lunch worth talking about then you should find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 6, wait time was about 20 minutes on a Thursday evening - when there were plenty of open tables and servers standing around that could have taken care of us. Our server was TERRIBLE, and by terrible, I mean it took her about 15 minutes just to bring our drink orders to the table. Just a bunch of waiting time in between every process. The food was mediocre - not impressive by any means. The server also messed up our checks (3 separate checks, one couple per each) and when confronted about it, we were told that it was someone's doing. This place is great if you like terrible service with poor excuses."}
{"text":"We like this place so so.  This is the second Wednesday I have been there and was not offered dessert and it has signs all over saying Free Pie Wednesday.  Service was really bad this time, but the food was really good."}
{"text":"Food is always spot on here. Went here last night and it was busy, our server Ashley did an awesome job taking care of us!"}
{"text":"Ordered prime rib and was very disappointed when it arrived. it was sliced so thin it looked more like a piece of lunch meat. Ceasers salad was swimming in so much dressing I couldn't eat it. Not worth the trip. Scrathed off my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"I was part of a group of four teaching friends for lunch today. Our waiter, Lamar, was fantastic and fun. I started off with their margarita special ($3.99) on Saturday. Then, I ordered the chopped steak topped with mushrooms and onions, along with side of bacon smashed potatoes, which is one of their $9.99 specials. Good food and fabulous service!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and the wait was over 30 minutes. We had a large party of 11 people and they were able to accommodate all of us at one table.

The service was fast and friendly. The prices were pretty cheap. Seemed like everything was about $10, which was good. 

My nephew ordered a drink called the Cotton Candy Shirley Temple. That thing was crazy! It was a glass of Sierra Mist with a huge piece of cotton candy on top. You push the cotton candy into the soda and stir it up and get a hot pink sweet drink. Pretty cool! 

For dinner I ordered the 12 Spice Chicken Pasta. It was pieces of chicken served with green bell peppers, onions, parmesan cheese, and linguini, with a cream sauce. I also ordered the Tomato Basil soup.

The soup came out first and it tasted exactly like marinara sauce. It was thick and spaghetti saucey. I had my nieces try it to see if I was crazy, and they all agreed that this \"soup\" would be better served over noodles with some meatballs.

The pasta came out and it was alright. There definitely could have been more sauce, the noodles were a little too dry for my taste. The sauce basically absorbed the flavor of the green peppers, so it didn't taste creamy and cheesy, it just tasted like bell pepper. I don't know what the 12 spices were, because I didn't taste them. This meal was just a bland pasta dish, and it was kind of disappointing. 

My nephew got salmon and he loved it, one of my nieces had ribs, and she loved them. One of my other nieces for chicken parmesan and she liked it. I think maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Our waitress Sam was friendly, professional and attentive, which made the dining experience a very pleasant"}
{"text":"We were greeted with a warm smile by the manager. He seated us and we got great service. The food was good and so was the atmosphere. I would recommend this location to anyone. We will be back. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"A surpringly good steak.   Overdone?  Well yes, but such is life outside of Captial Grille.  IT was still delish, not overly salty, and tasted like BEEF.

The asparagus was decent, the rolls were tasty, and the drinks were fun.

I guess the best description is a better version of Applebees or fridays.  A cut above, if only slight.  It still has that mass-produced feel, but hey. 

So not really a place *I'd* take a date, but if you're reading this while wearing a jersey, your date will probably be impressed that you stepped up your game a bit (but only a little bit. . but then again she's happy when you shave and/or put down the xbox controller to ask her if she wants pizza so expectations are low. . .  very low.)

Yes,  I am making fun of you.

Putz"}
{"text":"I don't know how much cooking the chefs actually do as it tastes like most items are microwaved or deep fried. It's the same as Friday's or Applebee's just with a different sign out front. 

Brunch is available on the weekends with food that is on par with most diners, but with a \"premium\" cost. It is what it is. 

If you never get a chance to eat here you will not be missing out on anything."}
{"text":"This was the first time my family and I had visited this restaurant. We have a large-ish family and don't often go out to eat together. While researched online on the ocharleys website we saw that all kids meals were free with a paying adult meal Awesome! We arrived at the restaurant at about 530 the place was pretty empty due to the early bird crowd leaving. The hostess asked us if we could wait for her to clear a table off in the bar area so we waited about 10 minutes for her to get the table cleaned off. After being seated we received mediocre service and cold food. The kicker to the whole experience is that when we received our check we realized that we didn't get free kids meals and we were told that this store doesn't do all of the corporate promotions.  That could have been forgiven but the combination of everything earned this place 1 star."}
{"text":"O'Charley's is an ok place to eat. You won't be thrilled by the menu, but your meal will be good and come to the table quick."}
{"text":"My mother and I stopped in for dinner on a Saturday afternoon, and our dining experience was exceptional. The food was delicious and prepared exactly as we asked, and the service was great as well. Our waiter, Rafael, was great and helped us with some excellent menu recommendations. Next time we come to Gastonia we'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Meh. Just a lot of meh. Meh prices, meh food, meh service. This is not a place I choose to go unless my coworkers are having an outing. My experience several times now has involved greasy, bland food, jumbled waiters, and a price tag that just doesn't reflect my experience. I'll comment on a few food items in particular:

Fried Catfish: Soggy and slimy under the breading. I've never seen catfish like this before. Gross.
Cajun Chicken Pasta: Oily and bland, doused with cajun french fry seasoning. Really disappointing for a pasta dish, but the chicken isn't bad, so I can stomach it.
Tater Tot Fondue: Don't even waste your money. Freezer tots with really fake-tasting cheese. Just bad.

Coworkers that normally clean their plate only finish part of it. I've even seen someone send back a burger because of how mediocre it was. The ONLY saving grace for this place are the rolls, which are pretty delicious.

I honestly don't know who keeps picking O'Charley's for lunch, but it sure isn't me."}
{"text":"In general we eat here when are heading somewhere else, and are in a hurry. Today it was lunch. I got 1/2 sandwich and soup combo. The meat in the sandwich was cold, the bread (Texas toast had simply soaked up whatever grease they were using to grill it. Certainly they had not actually grilled the bread -- it was soggy), the bacon was also cold. The pimento cheese was to put it bluntly gross. The soup, tomato basil however, was really good. Too bad I did not just stay with the soup. The tables in this restaurant are always dirty and sticky. Today I took a napkin and wiped down the area in front of me, the napkin came back dark brown and really gross. So the whole experience was not as well as we had hopped."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times.  Very good food and great value for a chain.  Ordered the Labor Day Special to go--2 slabs of ribs, 4 sides, rolls and a whole pie.  WOW.  Great value for $40.  Ribs were delicious and pie tasted home-made.  Will definitely order this again when it is offered."}
{"text":"Food at O'Charley's is always decently good. The Pecan Chicken Salad is a staple of you want a salad for a meal. 

The largest issue we have is with the curbside service. Every time we order takeout there is an issue with the food or things they forgot, i.e. salad dressing, dipping sauces, silverware, rolls. Then the waiting game begins of when those items will be brought out. 

Very poor service and proofing the food orders in all honesty."}
{"text":"Went there looking for a relaxing quiet evening, the waiter was rather immature, complained about getting stiffed by other customers, making bad jokes, I wasn't there to hear his problems, just wanted a peaceful meal."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner on a weekday during the summer. As the hostess proceeded to seat us she began cleaning the table with an old , wet , smelly rag. As I saw my son sitting I noticed that the seats where drenched with dirty water from the rags. I then noticed the edges of the table dripping with dirty water. I politely asked the hostess if she cold wipe it off !!! She looked at me as if I had 6 heads and she was about to use the same dirty rag. I then asked her to bring clean napkins and if looks could strangle me!!!!! After that welcoming ordeal I really could not enjoy the food or even begging to tell you what I ate!!! We will not return"}
{"text":"The steak is usually cooked exactly to my tastes. The one time it wasn't the manager quickly replaced my steak with a much larger one that was perfect. Love the potato soup!"}
{"text":"This O'Charley's was just ok. I've been to other locations that were better. The yeast rolls, weren't like the other O'Charley's I went to and that was the only reason I wanted to go there. Perhaps they have changed them? I'm not sure. 

I really wanted to give this location 2.5 stars, but that wasn't an option. It wasn't spectacular, and I've definitely had better service elsewhere. I ordered chicken tenders and those were actually pretty good, which was the best part about visiting on this day."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch. The food and service has always been good. I'd recommend signing up for their email plan for specials and 20% off discount offers. Nothing spectacular but good reasonably priced food. Good kids selections as well."}
{"text":"Free pie always gets my attention I have to admit. A friend and I decided to have lunch here 4/4 and were not totally disappointed. We were shown to a table right away which was good. But with six servers running around it was several minutes before one stopped at our table. Gave the drink and lunch order at that time to expedite maters. Again it was several minutes until she returned with drinks less the lemon and bread. Not to long after that the lemon arrived and shortly after so did the bread.  I ordered a French Dip with sweet potato fries and a honey mustard dip. My friend ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and a salad. We ate two pieces of bread before his salad arrived and he had almost finished it when the rest of the food arrived. My French Dip was ok but my fries were not sweet potato and there was no honey mustard dip. My friend got what he ordered and we both had warmed cherry pie with ice cream for desert. 

The food was good even though my order was wrong it was still good. So I give it 3 stars on the food but only 2 stars on the service. 

There were also two incidents that caught our attention. Two elderly ladies were visibly unhappy with something they discussed with a manager. A young lady who was there with two children and an older lady left out of the restarunt crying saying she just wanted to go home. She left one child and the elderly lady in the booth. Was it a Restarunt problem who knows but with the service and wrong orders sure could have been."}
{"text":"I must say I have never ate at an O'Charlies prior to today, thus I really have no expectations on how this restaurant should be or what the standard experience is. That being said the place was very clean and had a fair amount of people in for a lunch rush on a Tuesday. Upon entering I was a little put off by the hostess; after asking her for a table for two..she stared blankly at me waited for my dining companion to walk up and then stared for another awkward 5 seconds then asked inquizatively if there were just two people. She then walked really slow the the table. Maybe I am being picky but most establishments put the 'people persons' as the host/hostess. Once we were seated we were promptly brought warm rolls and our drinks were ordered. I can't remember our waitresses name but she was very helpful. We originally decided on this place because of an advertisement for lunch under 8 dollars. Once we got the menu it was impossible to find these specials. Luckily our waitress pointed us to the drink menu which had an insert with the specials. I ordered a salad and the 12 spice pasta ..it was decent not bad for under 7 dollars. My mother had the citrus chicken..which was  a very large portion but relatively spicy as well. Over all the food was mediocre....but like most chains you can't expect much more. I will say it was nice to have the manager come over and ask how everything was. The customer service was great :) Loved our waitress.."}
{"text":"Horrible! Service was slow, food mediocre at best. Manager borderline unprofessional. Never again!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice. Food wasn't all that great. Their chicken tenders were good as expected. The fried green tomatoes was not so tasty. The batch of asparagus was 5/50"}
{"text":"Trash.

Too greasy.  Bland.  Terrible service on top of that.  Just knock this place down and build a Publix please."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and we had a super waitress. Way to go Jennifer! She was very polite, attentative and quick."}
{"text":"I have never been to O'Charley before.. But I heard the biscuits is to die for. So I'm like why not. Little man and I stopped in around 6:45pm on a Wednesday. It's a full house but not jammed pack. Our waiter is Steve. Hostess seated us right away. 

Food: 5/5 chips and spicy Queso cheese dip. The chips are potatoes that seem to be lightly fired but not greasy. And the cheese wasn't spicy as mentioned so I'm ok with. Little man loves it. 
I had the T-bone steak. 22oz to be exact. It's soo good. Well seasoned and cooked medium. Perfection! 

Restaurant: 4/5 They can be slow with busting the table. But decor was comforting and simple. 

Customer service: 4/5 Steve was get but at times, it seem like I would wait a bit to get a refill on coke or a box or even for him to take my check. 

All and all. I like this place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Deli style. Service was so so. Okay atmosphere. Got kinda confused with the layout. Didn't realize that staff clears your table until we couldn't find trash cans"}
{"text":"Tonight we came in for Veterans Day to celebrate my stepfather and I have to say this was the best dining experience I've ever had! To be greeted by amazing and friendly hostess staff to being given to a manager for service! I can't say enough about Stephanie. She instantly made us feel at home! She was on top of caring for us every minute. She made amazing suggestions. And took time with us. After already being ecstatic about the service, our food comes out absolutely amazing! Warm and cooked to perfection! Every bit about this experience was amazing that by the end we were all ready to come back tomorrow! Awesome job! Thanks for caring for and loving your Veterans and for the wonderful event you had for them! This is a place that will continuously get the business of our family - deservingly! Keep up the amazing work! We can't wait to tell everyone about your amazing service and staff and our amazing experience! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"The food is loaded with fat. There are very few items on the menu that are healthy. The service is s-l-o-w. We waited 45 minutes to get our food one day, and have not been back since. Although they do offer free kids meals, the kids are so tired of waiting, that it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"We love that place.
They changed there menu and I am fine with that,they got pot roast on the menu super good.
 Service was friendly and on her feet.
That place is always  in good shape.
Love that the manager always come around to ask if everything is or was ok,we love that.
The food is always fresh.
Oh and those fresh dinner rolls,love ,love,love them."}
{"text":"I like the food at this place but the main problem is always how long you wait to get your food. No matter if it's rush hour lunch time or a slow midweek night, the food takes forever to come. The service is kind of hit or miss. Some days the service is incredible and other days it's the worst. If the service was better and the food didn't take up to an hour to come out, I would rate this place much higher."}
{"text":"My wife describes then as an expensive Applebee's because they have everything you could want on the menu, pasta, steak, burgers, salads, etc. Steaks are almost always cooked to perfection. My wife and I go here over Longhorn and Outback when we want steak."}
{"text":"The server was awesome.  The food was good.  I've been to several O'Charley's Restaurants, and the food is always pretty decent.  This particular store had excellent service.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant restaurant. It's a nice alternative to some of other similar style restaurants. The menu has many options for entrees and the option to add a salad/soup + a dessert for each entree. The portions have always been large so plan on needing a box. I had the caramel pie, which was very sweet but that's to be expected. I heard nice things about their fruit pies and their brownie dessert is enormous and nice to split. They have good specials on Wednesday (free pie day) and weekends(prime rib day). They tend to took the steak one degree above what you want so if you like medium, order medium rare for a nice pink and firm steak. This last time I went they forgot to put in my order but offered me a free appetizer while I waited and were very nice about it. The food is good quality for a reasonable price and the staff is very nice. I will be returning on a Wednesday in the near future for free pie Wednesday."}
{"text":"Service is the worst food was ok though.  I wouldn't recommend unless you have a lot of patience."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked out. 
Depends on the atmosphere u r looking for but this was more like s senior citizen
Outting on a Wednesday. HaHa
Looks very commercial and feel the $10 dinner options bring in the seniors. I picked Cheddars over this which had a nicer atmosphere. 
Can't comment on food since I didn't eat but atmosphere seemed like a large cafeteria. No obvionce"}
{"text":"I usually come here once every 2 weeks or so and order the same thing. .fish and chips which are not bad. Today same thing but the complimentary yeast rolls were no way the norm. Dense and then over cooked. Bottom dark brown.  When I inquired was given a cery lame excuse that it is because it is winter. What dies winter, which is outside, have anything to do with yeast rising in a hot kitchen.  I guess the bartender thought I was drunk..drinking iced tea here. On top  after I complained there was not even an offer to check the kitchen for a better batch or pan of rolls..poor custmer service. 

Anyway,  very disappointed with the bread and even more with the lane excuse and lack of customer service. Can someone get it right here."}
{"text":"Delicious prime rib, great food options and they change the menu often. I forget his name, but the day shift bartender is my favorite in town. We eat here often, never once was there an issue."}
{"text":"Giving this place 2 stars because their host Rachel was one of the word hosts I have ever encountered. She was rude, and so disrespectful. Apparently my family, party of 8, came in around dinner time so of course this place was busy. Not only were most tables occupied but all the waiting benches were full of people waiting to get seated. Rachel kept walking by us standing around yelling \"EXCUSE ME\" and shaking her head every chance she got. I'm sorry Rachel but where else would you like us to stand? There was no room anywhere else. Then she has the nerve for one last time to stomp by us shaking her head yelling \"EXCUSE ME!\" And walks to the host stand.. 2 feet away from where we were standing and decides to complain about us. So of course we heard everything. Worst host, server was okay. Manager at least came over and talked to us and apologized for Rachel's poor attitude after we complained to the other host who sat us. If I haven't said it enough Rachel was terrible!!"}
{"text":"Ya, no.... I was excited to visit a restaurant after my name stake. This highly let me down. So much for their \"famous\" chicken tenders. They were garbage! They were highly over cooked, breaded, deep fried, yuck! I consider myself to be an aficionado of the food and to this day the best ones I have had were at Chili's.  Very disappointing. I was expecting an Irish feel which it lacked. The most amusing thing was learning that the blimp hanger off Kelly Ave was actually a Zeppelin hanger in the 1920s. I learned this from my husbands trip to the rest room. 

Overall not impressed and I will NOT be back. Unless they paid me."}
{"text":"I like the wide selection of the menu. Quality food, with a priced fairly. Seated with no wait. Our waitress informed us they were out of Ribs, Prime Rib, and some other items. I ordered a sprite and it was flat, so I requested a ginger ale, which I was informed later does not have free refills. My wife's food came out, but there was a significant delay in my food coming out. It took so long, and without making a fuss, the manager decided to comp my meal. Few other things that happened that I don't want to sound overly critical of. But we will likely return in the distant future. Maybe in the summer."}
{"text":"We've driven past this place a thousand times, but I never paid any attention to it. It just didn't seem like a restaurant in my mind. I thought it was something similar to O'reilly auto parts. We finally decided to give it a try for a weekend lunch. It wasn't busy at all. The seats of our table had crumbs all over. The table also had some crumbs. Not the best first impression.

We were provided with 4 dinner rolls and butter, and also ordered the Top-Shelf Combo Appetizer ($11.99) to start. I would have been happy with just the dinner rolls, they were incredibly warm, soft, buttery, and delicious!! Wish we had more than 4 rolls. The appetizer was not as impressive. It came with 4 triangles of mildly spicy jack cheese wedges, 3 loaded potato skins, 3 chicken tenders, salsa, honey mustard, sour cream. I enjoyed the cheese wedges and chicken tenders, but the potato skins were overcooked - too dry and chewy. The salsa looked very unappealing, as if it had been sitting out for a long time and dried up, but it actually tasted much better than it appeared. The sour cream didn't add anything to the appetizer. I had signed up for the O'club, but the free appetizer deal didn't arrive at the same time as the welcome email. What a bummer that I couldn't use it while we were there because the free appetizer email didn't arrive until the following day.

I had the Low Country Shrimp for my main meal. It's listed under the $9.99 menu, and it's a great deal! The portion size was fantastic. The shrimp dish came with tomatoes, Andouille sausage, green onions, rice pilaf, and creole sauce. It resembled jambalaya and had a slight kick to it with all the black pepper. Loved the shrimp.

Service was decent, although I was clearly still eating when the waitress handed us the bill. This made me feel a bit rushed. The place was practically empty!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to an O'Charleys and I would be lying if I said I wasn't impressed.    I went for lunch while on a business trip in Charlotte;  when I first entered it reminded me of a coco's type of restaurant. The service was outstanding and the food was good.  I fell in with their sweet tea.  I can't wait to visit the south again to visit an O'Charleys again."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. We were seated quickly, but that was the last positive of the night. Our party of four ordered cocktails and after five or more minutes three of the four arrived, however, I had leave my seat to ask the bartender to make my drink. Finally, we started to order and learned they were sold out of prime rib at 7 pm. I settled for shrimp with asparagus and mashed, and my asparagus was burnt crisp. The manager did stop by the table after we asked to see him, and did prepare a new shrimp dish. The worst part, it was Free Pie Wednesday but the service was so horrible we couldn't wait to pay our bill and leave. We will not be back. Good luck O'Charleys on S Tryon. You need it.

Happy birthday to me!"}
{"text":"We were in Champaign and visiting a friend who suggested O'Charley's for dinner. It was a good suggestion! 

The atmosphere is similar to Applebee's or TGI Friday's, but the menu is somewhat different. The specialty seems to be hand battered chicken strips. But there is a selection of fried seafood and some prime rib selections as well as the usual burgers, ribs, potato skins, etc. 

The food was all very tasty and presented attractively. Service was attentive without being smothering. 

I'd recommend this as a good place to go before or after a movie or just for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Not great, not amazing. Probably the most bland typical chain restaurant I've ever been too. My tilapia was ok and the rolls were rolls. Free pie Wednesday's yay! Too bad I had a coupon and you can't combine the deals-Boohoo. Pretty much everything is friend here so hope you don't eat healthy."}
{"text":"I love ocharleys because the quality of the food is good for the price. We were in and out as quick as we wanted to be. The waiter was attentive but not bothersome and the food came out at reasonable time. I got the pork chop on a bed of bacon collars greens which was awesome ! I also got sweet potatoes which were just okay and a salad which I finished off the next day and was still good. Loved our waiter ... He had a sense of humor and was super nice. I recommend"}
{"text":"It was okay. I didn't finish my food and I ended up taking it home and not eating it anyway. The bread rolls weren't that great either."}
{"text":"The food was okay at best. The lime Margarita was absolutely terrible, I don't suggest it even if it's on sale. Definitely not worth the 30 min seat wait and the 45 minutes it took for our food arrive. It was understaff so the service was super slow, but the waitress was nice about it and tried to make up for it. Also got free pie, but it wasn't very good. I can't recommend this place unless it was very slow and you have nothing better to do."}
{"text":"Once I arrived at this restaurant per suggestion of a friend I had only been seen some of the negative reviews written about this place. I got a little worried because five of my girlfriends were meeting me there. Guys, the food was absolutely delicious, the drinks were amazing, the service was stellar, and we couldn't have been happier. We had a wonderful time and the atmosphere was great. 
Only thing I could complain about is maybe they should turn off Fox News. Lol."}
{"text":"We stopped here yesterday for a late lunch. We were seated quickly and our server was prompt with getting drink orders and lunch order. She brought hot rolls (which are delish) quickly. Then everything came to a halt. After 25 minutes, we asked another server to check on our order. Of course, they brought it right out because it had obviously been sitting in the kitchen for some time.  My husband ordered the chicken tenders tacos with a baked potato.  The chicken and potato were both cold.  I had a bowl of loaded potato soup which was hot and tasty, but it had obviously just been dipped up because soup was splashed all over the rim of the bowl. The group of 4 ladies sitting behind us got their dinners less than 10 minutes after ordering.  They were still eating their salads so our order must have fallen through the crack, which is inexcusable when the place is not busy."}
{"text":"My old roommate and I went here for a quick bite. I hadn't been to an O'Charley's in many many years. Their food is fancy bar food. I say fancy because it's very delicious while some bar food can be a bit crappy. The staff here was very sweet and were helpful with all of our questions."}
{"text":"First time here. Sat at bar. Service was decent. Draft prices seemed high. Menu was good and varied. I got the French dip with fries and it was just okay. My brother had crab cakes and he loved them."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch today.  Decorations outside were pretty.  Loud music, slow service.  Wife and daughter had the Southern Pecan Waffle Combo (didn't get many pecans, the potatoes and fruit garnish were missing), I had the Country Scramble (also missing the fruit garnish).  Small lukewarm portions on big plates.  Food quality would have been OK for a discount hotel breakfast buffet but not for what's supposed to be an individually prepared meal.  \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" sums it up perfectly."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about but the wait for our meal was forever and the bank got broke"}
{"text":"My neighborhood favorite O'Charley's was simply \"Semper Fi\" today, always faithful to serving veterans with a simply MARVELOUS offerings to the Nations veterans. I had a smothered chopped steak, with fried onions and Bacon smashed potatoes that outdid just about every meal that I ever had there, and that's quite a few. Service by my waitress was beyond reproach. I will be back shortly...after I hit the gym to shake this meal off.."}
{"text":"I had to take a moment to review my dining experience at this o'Charleys. I ate at the bar as this was on a Saturday evening and business was brisk, crowded even. Steven was at the helm at the bar an hats off to him, as he knows his stuff. I'm always impressed with wait staff who can remember your order WITHOUT writing it down, and Steven is of that class. Realizing that even the bar area is pretty full, he didn't miss a beat on full service to ALL.  I ordered a prime rib, dry rubbed in spices, well done that was simply exquisite. (My complements to the chef). Topped with a glass of great wine and for dessert a hot peach pie alamode..... My palate was pleased...."}
{"text":"O'Charley's clearly is one of my more favorite local restaurants in the Charlotte area. I came to enjoy their celebration for veterans on Veterans Day weekend. With my 84 year old veteran father in tow, him curious of the experience over Veterans Day weekend, we found the restaurant crowded, yet operating with maximum efficiency. Our wait time was about 20 minutes, which is about average for Saturday night at such a location.

O'Charley's had a selection for veterans that day of about 10 entrees, and both my father and I had the low country shrimp. My first opportunity to try this entree and I must admit it was succulent. A healthy heaping of shrimp drenched in a delicious sauce over a bed of rice that we both found quite irresistible. When you couple of meal like this with O'Charley's signature hot rolls, one tends to leave out wishing they had a wheelchair to roll you to the other car.
I have nothing but High Praise for this O'Charley's location, and add to that my father's high esteem and gratitude for their tribute to veterans, him noting that since he is new to the area that he's found a new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had brunch here today and it was great. The food was really good and our waitress was quick and friendly. I would definitely recommend to family & friends. We will definitely visit again soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to grab a quick lunch here and ordinarily this is not a bad place to grab lunch or dinner. Today was a dismal exception. We were seated promptly and greeted by our server. We ordered two unsweetened raspberry iced teas. We both agreed that these should be called tea flavored raspberry syrup. They were so sweet that my wife had to change to a straight unsweetened tea (which was old and stale). My wife ordered the unlimited soup and salad and I the buffalo \"kickin'\" sandwich. We waited more than 20 minutes to get our rolls, which were near inedible. Unsliceably soft is one thing, under baked balls of dough is another. We  then waited another 20 minutes on our meals (mind you the restaurant is not incredibly busy). Our server ran around a lot but never seemed to be accomplishing much. Not to mention her continued reference to us as \"babies\" and her friendly but brisk demeanor did nothing to endear her to us. My wife got her soup and her salad at the same time, which is a problem because she, like many folks I know like to eat their salad first, and this led to her soup being cold by the tome she ate it. She wanted a reorder of the soup following the completion of our meal and by the time we could flag our server down, she was frustrated and waited until we flagged the server down a second time (now more than an hour into the meal) to get her soup and a reorder of rolls (which were properly baked this time). Overall, other than the dough balls we initially received, the food quality was good, which is why I am giving a 2 star review. They have good steaks and salads, as well as other casual dining fare. The lackluster service, overlong wait for food and reordersduring an overall non busy time (2pm in the afternoon) and in general the lack of warm atmosphere discourages me from coming back to this location. I probably will at some point for objectivity's sake and give them another shot in the future."}
{"text":"The food this trip was great, the Server Kristina, Totally Awesome.  The Manager Fadi Awayda.  TERRIBLE.  I will  not go back, and I suggest you choose another establishment to dine at other than this one.  He is rude, condesending, abrasive, and down right ignorant to guest service. Again this is our 3rd visit to this particular restaurant, and it is not remotely the quality of other O Charleys, I have visited.  Defiantely implore the residents of Champaign Urbana not to dine here."}
{"text":"We've been here more than a few times, especially on free pie Wednesday. The food is always good, the servers nice, and the wait not bad. Today I have my first complaint. I got the French Dip sandwich. Sandwich itself was good, but the dip was so salt-laden it was close to inedible. It could have been good except for all that salt! 

Please, O'Charleys, cut back on the salt!"}
{"text":"The manager here and the wait staff are incredible! They did the absolute most to make sure we were happy and satisfied! We'll all definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Love O'Charley's. They have like a different special every day of the week. Tuesday's Kids way free with a paying Adult and they have 4$ house margaritas. The yeast rolls are sooooo good as well as their homemade lemonade. My Server Patrick was OUTSTANDING. When I say he knows how to up sell that is an understatement. He made me want things I didn't know I wanted. The manager on duty also checks on the customers. One disappointment was the Fried Green Tomatoes...the breading is nasty. I believe they fry them in cornmeal and drizzle with BBQ Sauce. Weird combo so I asked for sauce on the side. The food comes out quick and hot...and their drinks are really good too. One thing is they won't let you order more than one alcoholic beverage at a time. This was a first for me. The empty one has to be removed from the table."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  We had a very poor server.  She disappeared.  We had to ask another worker for my desert and the check.  We will not be back.  There are plenty of other places who would like our money.  The food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I was here when they first opened a few years back, sword I'd never return.  Today I thought, well, there have been a lot of cars in the parking lot, must have improved.   Where to begin...the long wait for our orders to be taken, the dirty silverware, the dried up food stuck to plates, the long wait to receive the order, the burnt salmon, the eyelash in the mac & cheese the incorrect refills on beverages not once but twice...NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I like O'Charley's. It is a great family friendly restaurant and there food hasn't disappointed us yet. The service was good and everything was served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"We went here for a few drinks and for the appetizers. It was decent. Not over the top great, but not bad. We ordered the nachos and the fried pickles. 

Our server Dana was great. She came to our table when we needed her and was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive waitstaff at this location.  In addition to our server, two other people came up and asked how we were doing.  There were no obvious gripes with the fact that everyone drank water w/lemon or that we had two groups of 4 (out of 5) people sharing a couple of their large portioned meals.  This showed professionalism from our waitress and definitely earned them a good review.

The food went over well with everyone in our group.  The BBQ ribs were very good, although not the meatiest ones I've had (i.e. compared to Lancaster's).  The balsamic vinaigrette is good enough to make you want seconds on salad or wish you saved some bread to dab the rest of it up.  My uncle claims they have the best buffalo chicken sandwich he's ever had so I'll need to give it a try whenever I get a chance.

We went on a Saturday night so the place was quite busy, but due to our providential timing we were seated relatively quickly.  The food primarily consists of standard fare for a mid-market chain eatery, but they do have a decent selection of seafood that gives a bit of an edge.  Unfortunately all drinks are listed on the drink menu so if you fail to look in advance you may feel like you are on the hot-seat when  it comes time to order.

All in all not bad."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Seated promptly but that's where it ends.
Took 2/12 hours to get salad, food came undercooked and cold .
After calling manager over several times and another half hour,got the bill.
Never again!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took 10 minutes to get our drinks and rolls, primarily because our waiter was flirting with women at the table behind us, giving them his number, and chatting away. Fries were undercooked and unseasoned, chicken tenders were old and dry. Didn't even want a replacement meal! Won't be seeing me as a customer again at this location."}
{"text":"Went with a large group and the service and food was great! My steak was very flavorful and tender. The complimentary bread was piping hot and soft. I wasn't the biggest fan of the mac n cheese, but everything else was so good, I had to give five stars!"}
{"text":"Great experience!! Pat was our waiter tonight , service was professional and extremely prompt also the food was delicious! We got the New Orleans Pasta. It was our first time coming and we certainly will be back. Thank you to the staff and management for a wonderful experience !!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times in the last year, including lunch today and are always pleasantly surprised by how nice and accommodating the staff is. Lauren was top notch! And our food was great, had the French Dip, crab cakes, chicken fingers, etc  we loved everything! Great job guys! And I like the old \"local\" pictures too!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and low drink prices.  The food options beat the standard chili's and longhorn nearby."}
{"text":"Food was good, but, restaurant was cold and breezy, to the point of being uncomfortable. Waitress forgot multiple things, had to be reminded.  Husband ordered all you can eat tenders, never got asked if he wanted more.  Turns out he did not, but, she asked the table behind us  (who came in 15 minutes after us) if they wanted more, took 2 steps, and forgot to ask him I guess.
Lackluster tonight."}
{"text":"Go at least once if not twice a week for lunch, always great food, great service and good pricing.  Clean and friendly.  Sha is great ask if she is working"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Friendly staff! I loved just about anything Ive ate here, except the steak. It was an awful cut of beef. I mean awful! Love the peacan chix salad! My hubby gets cajun chix pasta everytime, so it must be good! Love the chix tenders too! Always busy! Free pie on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Eh. sub-par food and sub-par service is the only way I can describe this place. I've been here more than once (not by my choice, mind you) and each time, the food gets more and more underwhelming. 

The last time I was there (and hopefully that time was my last!), I ordered the honey fried chicken and mashed potatoes w/gravy. The chicken was more fried skin than meat and the mashed potatoes seemed and tasted like something that had been reheated. It just reminded me of sad cafeteria food and not worthy of the $10 price."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on 3/14/2016 at 6:45 pm. Very few people, restaurant way maybe 1/3 full of customers. We wanted to sit in the bar area, to see the TV while dining, were told immediately \"no\", that wasn't possible (even though there were empty booths and no one at the bar. Two additional parties came in for tables. Hostess just stood there, asked how many in the party. 10-15 minute waits in a restaurant that had more empty tables than full!?! Staff were crawling all over the place, so it was not understaffed.  Our party got tired of waiting and finally just left. As we left, party of 5 arrived and they were told there was a 15 minute wait, no one ever got seated while we were there even though the place was practically empty. Hostess could have cared less that we left. Sad service, will never go back. Went to Jocks and Jill's instead and had an awesome experience there"}
{"text":"Aside from Chili's, this is the only chain restaurant I will visit.  It is close to home, their food has good value and is good.  Their interiors are nice and I have have laways had good service.  
Used local local as a touch-down space to do some work- free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I ordered takeout (today, Monday the 23).. since my food was wrong and had to be sent back. My broccoli?! Served in a plastic bag with a date sticker from last week. Way to go."}
{"text":"We had a much needed girls night out at OCharley's last night and had a wonderful time!  The server was attentive and funny, and recommended some great food!  The Nashville deviled eggs are delicious, but spicy (I suggest you ask for the Nashville sauce that is normally drizzled on them on the side if you don't like hot stuff).  Between the four of us we had the cedar planked salmon, Tuscan chicken, honey drizzled fried chicken, and filet mignon--everyone was very happy!  And if you like margaritas, try the grapefruit tangerine, it was delicious!  Extremely happy with my experience and would highly recommend OCharley's--for the food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Very noisy. Hard to have a conversation. Not a place to go to have conversation. Dinner was average tasting and on the pricey side for how it tastes. Seafood platter was dry and not very tasty. Tilapia was tasty while the asparagus was mushy.  Fried ice cream was a scoop of ice on a fried flat bread. The picture shows the ice cream as being fried. That didn't happen. Nothing like the picture. Not a place I'd pick yo go back to."}
{"text":"I went for apps and a couple drinks. Sat at the bar. Service was friendly enough. I ordered the potatoe skins and their version of spinach and artichoke dip. Both were fine. I wouldn't order the dip again, as they put greens in it along with the spinach. Not my thing, but there wasn't anything \"wrong\" with it. 

It's a little too kid friendly for my taste. Families were sitting in the bar area which I thought was strange. That would be my only real complaint though. 

Chain restaurants aren't my thing, but I would go back to O\"Charlies in a pinch."}
{"text":"Good place, food is good and Service is great.  Had the pretzels for an app, not bad, same as everyone else's pre made apps."}
{"text":"The asian waiter 'Tiger' is awesome!  Had him several times and he does it right.  Jokes, service, this guys a class act!  Food was good too!"}
{"text":"This place is disgustingly nasty and the staff are always rude. Last time I waited over an hour for my food, why, because my waitress was too busy playing on her phone and not being attentive to her guest. Also not to mention I ordered water and it was only filled up once through out my meal. I will NEVER be back tot his place again."}
{"text":"Service was fine, food was not. Stopped in for brunch and ordered the Deconstructed Taco. Diced chicken, bacon, eggs, pico and jalapenos. The server said it was one of his favs since they added it to the menu. I didn't count it against him since it probably WAS good when he tried it but for me that was not the case. The diced chicken was hard and rubbery, the pico was more like jarred salsa and the food on the outside of the plate wasnt as warm as the food in the middle. The tortillas were heated in the microwave and rolled up so they were hard as hell and trying to unroll them made a cracker crumb mess. I'm not one to send back my food so I just made a note to self not to order it again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while, this last visit was a total disappointment. We ordered clam chowder, chopped salad and salmon. First the waitress bring my water and my husband's beer, the beer was all spilled out. Then we wait about 30 mins for our food when the restaurant wasn't even full. Then, she brings my clam chowder, cold, excuse me!! Who eats the chowder cold?? I asked for it to be warm up. When she brought it back, she was like: \" ouch! It's hot\" like she got burned or something. I tried it, yes, it was warmer than the first time, but it wasn't even close to hot. Tired to ask again because she was being too dramatic. Finally, our food arrives, this is not the first time I order these food, but the they all tasted great previously, this time, fish was not fresh, it has a funny looking and taste. And you can just tell The lettuce in th salad was old, They didn't have the crunchy. When my husband order the salad, he said bulcheese on the side, then it come with bulcheese and honey muster, both in cups that are sitting in the salad, except, the honey muster is spilled on the big part of the salad. When she brought the food out, she also laid down the bill, and said: just so you don't need to wait on me....like I said, the restaurant was not full, and she wasn't serving a lot of table. Anyway, we finished the meal, but will not go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Hate to break it to you guys but I've worked here and had to quit. This place is probably ranked #1 out of the top 5 most disgusting restaurants. I was a hostess and I tried in my best ability to provide excellent customer service as all hosts should. And I succeeded of course, but everything that happened behind me was terrible. The place is unsanitary, they hire for your more for your \"personality\" then your work ethic and they don't clean anything thoroughly... Literally everything is filthy. I would have to roll silverware on dirty tables in the back. I oversaw my manager flip a piece of meat with his bare hands(absolutely disgusting) Free pie Wednesday sucks b/c they leave the pies out all day and heat up your slice for 20 seconds when you order it so you THINK it's \"fresh.\" Majority of the servers are HORRIBLE, and most of them are constantly complaining about how they hate their job. I could not take it anymore. I hate this place with a \"passion\"(if you've been there you'll understand me) lol. But yeah, DONT GO HERE. THIS IS THE WORST O'CHARLEY'S IN CLT!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on my way to a concert and plus I had a gift card.  Good place, friendly staff food was good.."}
{"text":"This restaurant has seen better days... Horribly long wait for food. Most entrees came out except for one. Had to wait again. Bad management, several upset customers. Not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. I hadn't even pulled out my phone to check in yet & bread was already being sat down on my table. Wow!
Portions & service was outstanding! I was impress w/our servers professionalism."}
{"text":"Our experience was average. There is really nothing signature or exceptional about the food or serve. As we walked in the manager was the hostess she looked at us and said I really have no idea what's going on. Then yells to the bartender asking her a question about someone cover a shift. The food was just ok. I feel over priced for what portion and quality."}
{"text":"Food is good. We had terrible service. Server wanted to take our dessert order about 5 minutes into our meal and then we never saw her again until time to pay the bill. We actually wanted to order dessert but never got the chance."}
{"text":"One star today. My dinner was good.
The server forgot my daughter's soup, we didn't get rolls till half way through the meal, we found something on our chicken tenders.
Then to top it off, two people in our party threw up, one while still there eating. The other half hour later. The management was very understanding and took care of the bill.
Not sure what was going on in the kitchen tonight, but hopefully nobody else gets sick."}
{"text":"First time going. Loved it. We will definitely be going back. So many different things to try. For today being busy for Mothers Day, the wait wasn't too bad, 30 minutes and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch today, and it was sub-par at best. I had the chicken pot pie. Never again! I've had better at a fast food joint. Their service is spotty, although today it was pretty good. I'm just tired of paying for meals that I'd rather not eat. Probably won't visit here again for awhile."}
{"text":"Was on vacation and decided to try something quick for lunch. This was the wrong choice. 10 minutes to get a drink, 5 more minutes to get a straw. Fried pickles were good the rest of it was bland and slow getting out. Even their pie that they advertise all over the place as so special was bad, and not over cooked bad, more like frozen boxed pie that shouldn't be served. Even my 7 year old didn't like her chocolate cream pie(French silk is what they call it I think) it was like powder and half whipped cream slapped on a plate."}
{"text":"Was told 20 minute wait. We waited an hour and a half...I understand it was a holiday, but as we were waiting, I heard a kid say \"can we tell everyone it's a 2 hour wait so they will all leave.\" There was several empty tables, yet they wouldn't seat anyone. I understand they need time to let the kitchen catch up, but waiting at a table is better than standing by the host stand for over an hour."}
{"text":"Let me say up front that I love the O'Charley's franchise in general. 

While traveling far from home on business, I always count on O'Charley's for a decent lunch or dinner with consistency in food, quality, menu selection, and service. 

I love their ribs, my personal favorite their \"black and blue salad,\" their desserts, their bar, their varied menu selection, their cleanliness, and most of all those addictive - hot. buttered. yeast rolls. I have ruined several dinners by filling up on a basket of those yeast rolls prior to receiving my entrée. LOL.

Now on to my review of O'Charley's University City......

This is the worst O'Charley's franchise location that I have encountered in sixteen states.

Why?

The food here is mundane, and a generally poor expression of O'Charley's menu.

The service is extremely slow......IF you receive service at all. 

They appear to have a lot of employee turnover, because during our company lunches there, we all noticed that our waitresses were not on point. We had to ask multiple times for refills, where our food was, for the check, etc. 

Our general manager was also a fan of O'Charley's, and he opted to have our company Christmas lunch there one year. (Can you imagine?) Service was so poor that we never went back. Our server was so inept that a manager had to intervene and help out. 

On my absolute LAST visit to this location, I arrived early to beat the lunchtime crowd. I was promptly seated by one of the THREE giggly teenage girls manning the front kiosk. 

Then nothing, absolutely nothing.

I never saw a waitress in our area. No one took my order for either drinks or food. 

While I was waiting patiently for a wait person to materialize, restaurant tables began filling up rapidly in other areas. Other waitresses were taking orders, while I sat there watching my potential lunch order go behind the later arrivals. This did not make me happy. 

In hindsight, I guess that I could have gotten up and moved to another table in another section, but at the very least, one always expects a restaurant to recognize their customer's presence at a table. Hindsight is always 20/20. It was not clear to me that day. 

After twenty minutes of no waitress entering our service area.....I got up and left.

The three pubescent maître 'ds were huddled around smiling and giggling like Japanese girls in a Tokyo arcade. I was so angry that I vowed to never return to this foul place, and I never have and never will. 

I was so angry that I contacted the restaurant manager and O'Charley's corporate.

The restaurant manager was defensive, and O'Charley's corporate sent me a $25 gift card. I used this card at the O'Charley's in Hickory, where I received stellar service and an overpriced rib eye steak. 

I hope that they have changed managers and employees in the interim, but it will be a cold day in **** before I ever set foot in this place again. 

PS: I especially love all of the fake Yelp reviews that have popped up recently for this location - quite entertaining."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Nice big restaurant.  Staff was knowledgeable. Don't know if I'd keep going there with a Texas Roadhouse down the street."}
{"text":"Nothing new about this place same as all OCharlies. But it was clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Let me be very clear here the food was excellent but it is not worth waiting over 2 hours for. Went for dinner and also had a to go order. Our waiter took the orders and then started the long wait. We received our drinks and rolls and my side salad. Then after 45 minutes are entrees came. Ok . I then asked him about the order to go and he said it was already put in. Great! Another hour goes by still no to go order. Waiter was apologizing for the delay. I told him to just cancel it and he said it was on the house. Went to talk to manager but he did not come forward to address this issue. Another 30 minutes go by finally my to go order! Food good service acceptable but the wait for my food will keep me from going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm very pleased with the speedy customer service. Management responded promptly to my dissatisfaction.   Although I will still avoid going close to closing time, I will eat at this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"I stopped going to O'Charley's about 13 years ago because I had a horrible experience. recently I decided to give them a try once again and man was I surprised! The service was great and the food was extraordinary."}
{"text":"I had the tortellini with Russian sauce (tomato vodka) and it was great. I am partial to tomato sauces, but it was not overly sour. It comes with quarter size tomatoes that was a bit off putting, but the taste will have me going back ."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative star review! It's my husbands birthday and he didn't want to go in and sit inside the so we ordered the curb side to-go. Ordered two meals totaling $37 and some change...cool. We get home 20 min away to find out his food is wrong. He tried to be a good sport about it. He ordered the Louisiana steak medium rare.. after taking a bite of the Mac and cheese and finding it unsatisfactory me moved on to the WRONG steak. Even tho it was the wrong steak he was going to eat it anyways until he cut it and it was well done. So I had to drive 20 min back to the restaurant for them to replace his steak, I asked for the Mac and cheese to be replaced by the grilled asparagus. (I even brought the old food back) I was told it was $1.40 up-charge to change the side on a meal that was incorrect that I had to drive back and get! A manager who was already clocked out and getting ready to leave happened to stop to talk to me... I said they could easily comp $1.40 since I wasn't asking for both meals free or even his wrong one... so by the time I go home to eat with him my food would now be cold! All I got was a \"oh I'm sorry don't worry about the $1.40 they didn't know they had messed the food up.\" My point is I drove 20 min back for them to fix my husbands birthday dinner, eat my food cold... what a great birthday dinner experience! We will never return to this location EVER again! I have been a General Manager at a restaurant before and that's not how you handle situations... I'm glad at least one of us gets a hot meal.. even if I spent 20 min each way driving... TWICE for to be compensated for our food, time, or gas   I tip my hat to you o Charlie's on giving out the worst experience I have had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Frankly, I'm surprised this place has remained in business as long as it has.  I gave it a couple of chances, but always walked away disappointed.  The food isn't really the issue, but it's nothing special either.  The service here is consistently atrocious.  I've had waiters forget about me, I've seen them bring out completely incorrect orders, and I've had cold food brought out after absurdly long waits.  For this type of dining, just head up the road to Chili's and give O'Charley's a pass."}
{"text":"Strictly a middle of the road spot, in line with a Fridays or Applebees. It is what it is. I personally wouldn't return, but if that kind of fare is your thing it will do."}
{"text":"Thursday night my wife, our daughter and her friend and I wanted a good dinner. So we went to O'Charlie's in Monroe. They have a new menu since we were there. A lot of new items and some carryovers. I decided to order a new dish, steak and crab cake. I'm glad I did. The crab cake was my first attack, it was nicely done with a moist sauce. The flavor of the crab was nicely strong and true. After I had wolfed it down I went to the steak. The 6oz 3/4\" thick meat was not the medium rare I asked for, but the aging and cut made that portion good as well. I left the restaurant with an uncontrolled smile on my face, you can't beat that meal. And the price was right."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly here. We like to go for lunch or on Sunday when it's a bit cheaper. The salmon is one of the best things on the menu while the burgers aren't too bad either. Their rolls that they bring out are delicious! They'll bring you more if you keep asking for some. You can't go wrong with the food here and the pie is good too!"}
{"text":"I usually like O'Charlies but apparently tonight was not a good night. The salad was old and withered and pretty much not edible. The medium rare steak was hard and tough and I was unable to eat that also... But my 2 dogs at home will be thrilled with this steak!! Thank God the baked potato was safe!!!
O'Charlies, please re-evaluate yourselves!!"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience with the server and not coming back again . The filet mignon steak is as hard as a rock and it says in the menu that it has garlic but not even a bit of it is there . So disappointed that we are still eating & server wanted to take our plates . People pls watch out this place ."}
{"text":"Terrible food and bad service. First time we went there, the soup tasted like they threw in last week left over and added some cream and cheese to it. Second time we went there chicken tasted moldy, we spit it out and food went back ...when we were paying told the server about moldy chicken. She said; oh why didn't you let me know? I would of gotten you something different. Anyhow she brought the check w chicken still included in the bill. We payed and tipped and never going back. I have serious concerns about what's going on in there kitchen. Wondering when was the last time health department inspected them."}
{"text":"I am usually pleased with my experience at OCharleys but not this time. The restaurant is not busy especially considering it is a Sunday evening. Although it is not crowded there are multiple dirty tables and the floor needs sweeping.  Despite the obvious work to be done, two employees are seated at a table in conversation. My date ordered baby back ribs which were extremely fatty and not too tasty. I ordered the honey dipped buttermilk fried chicken, it was fried too hard but tasty. My collard greens were too sweet but the mashed sweet potatoes were good. 
The customer service needs improvement. We walked in to an empty hostess stand. A waitress walked by, did not greet us but yelled to her coworker that there were people at the door. Our disheveled waitress was not rude but could have been more professional and pleasant. I had to get up to find her to request silverware after we received our food. The bathroom was smelly and unkempt."}
{"text":"How do I give zero stars? I ordered a salad with the chipotle chicken tenders on it. The first time it came out it had grilled chicken with barbecue sauce on the side. I sent it back telling her that I had chipotle chicken and she returned with the same chicken tossed in the barbecue sauce. I told her again that I asked for chipotle chicken and she and I manager informed me that this was chipotle chicken. My daughter was with me and she actually had chipotle chicken. when I pointed out that they were nothing alike she just said that I was mistaken and left the plate. I ended up not eating my order and still get charged for it without any attempt to make it correct by the restaurant. That will be the last dollar that O'Charleys gets from me"}
{"text":"Stopped in here around 12:30 right before start of big Panther's playoff game.  It was one of the closest bars to our hotel other then Ruby Tuesday's that we could walk to.   It was still 2.5 miles but a nice day.    Sat at the bar and had drinks. Drinks are good and reasonably priced.  Shared a bowl of the potato soup which was also good.   Shared appetizer sampler.  I NEVER get appetizer samplers that consist of chicken tenders and potato skins.   i think both are stupid.   However after ready all the great reviews about Ocharley's chicken fingers I thought we would give it a shot.   they were overcooked and tastae like a chicken finger off any kids meal at any chain restaurant.   Potato skins are potato skins.    These both get 2.  the cheese things however were great!   
Made a stop the following week  for hh.   Another margarita not as good as the one at the bar first time.  Was lured in by hh priced nachos.   Cheese whiz?   Not!  
The only good thing was my first margaritaand the cheese triangles.   And the soup.
and serivce was horrible the 2nd time!!  Took forever to get check!"}
{"text":"It's good, server Jordan was good, food was good. Will go again. I had the catfish dinner, came out in like 10 mins"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Not my first choice but cant be too picky with this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars only because of the great service. Our server, Anita, was very friendly and wasn't bothersome during our meal. This was my first O'Charley's experience and probably my last. Environment was great, service was great, but the food was below average. Just your typical every day meal that was not worth the money."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in just around 2PM on a Saturday...not very busy and seated right away..that was the best part. 5 minute wait to get drinks...appeatizer (fried pickels) came just before entrees and did I forget to mention we never received our salads? They took our food back in the kitchen to keep warm while we ate our salads..we enjoy going there..they have a good menu but this is the second time in three visits that service has been bad..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a large shopping center area off of 74 (Roosevelt/ independence). I have been a few times during lunch only and each time the staff are friendly and provide great service. Each day they offer special. I recently went on a Wednesday and it was the place to be. It was packed. They have free pie Wednesday. So if you aren't from the area or done typically dine here FYI it's busy on this day. I especially enjoy the rolls. They are hot buns with a slight hint of honey. The food options I have tried have been good. The over loaded potato soup will warm you up and it's creamy. The pecan chicken tender salad is a must try. The crispy chicken on a bed of romaine with cranberries and blue cheese is a flavorful meal that will be sure to hit spot. The apple pie is pretty good as well. I have tried some of their sandwich options, but the items above are my recommendations. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great steaks and salmon.  Always love the potato soup.  Had the $9.99 steak & gravy over a biscuit and it was so good.  

Always enjoy it."}
{"text":"The food is good for the bar and grill fare; however the staff is horrid.  I had a problem with the poor inattentive and inaccurate wait staff on several occasions, so I began ordering by phone and still had issues with accuracy of the order.  It's very apparent that professionalism is not the priority.  Haven't gone back in 6 months and won't ever return.  With a Chili's, Applebees, and Mr C's in the area; better options are abound.  Avoid if possible"}
{"text":"Rolls are fantastic as always. Ordered entrees and and appetizer and the entrees came out first. Also had to ask for our silverware. Food was great, just wish our server would have gotten things right."}
{"text":"Rarely come here because the wait for service is always long. Gave it another try because they have some good lunch salads and a patio. 

Server came to us after about 10 minutes.  Her vocabulary primarily consisted of two words, \"absolutely\" and \"awesome\".  

Pop music is annoyingly loud on the patio. There is a nice breeze and the traffic noise isn't too noticible

Salads are good but know that the regular and half-size have the same amount of meat and key ingredients, the regular just has more lettuce."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with coworkers, and it's a really large restaurant. Unfortunately, our service was a bit slow from beginning to end. I tried the roll that they were famous for, and it was just okay. It was odd that they only gave us 5 for a party of 7. I ordered the fried catfish and fries, and I found the catfish and breading to be really salty. Coleslaw was decent. Overall, this place was just okay, wouldn't be at the top of my chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Sometimes you get to choose the restaurants and sometimes the person you're eating with makes the choice. Because my friend has a three year old and he likes the corn dogs on the kids menu, this was her choice.

It's a very standard casual dining. Very similar to Applebee's, Friday's, Tuesday's and the like. No salad bar, but they have a large dining area and a large bar area. The menu is classic American entrees that usually come with fries. I had a turkey cheese burger which was okay. Get the sweet potato fries if you remember. My friend had the prime rib, which was surprisingly a really good cut. Not very marbled or fatty, it was an inch thick and it was all meat. With mashed potatoes, it looked excellent.

Service was good. You have to pay attention for navigating to the restaurant. There are a couple of fast food places and none of them have an entrance through their parking lot.

Here's where I take off the third star. Why did I get charged $2.49 for a soda water? This simple glass of carbonated water (no Coke syrup) maybe cost them 25 cents and that's if I dropped the glass. What a ripoff here. Seriously."}
{"text":"O'Charley's is not a bad chain restaurant but I have nothing to rave about this place neither. The food was average and pretty standard in term of quality, nothing unique or different than what you would see at other common chains like Chili's or Applebee's. The food was reasonably priced and sometimes they have a great deal like 2 meals for $15. The service was friendly and courteous. For a chain restaurant, I probably stop by once every 2 months."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Seated primptly. Greeted with a smile and energy. Appetizer Sampler was served promptly and hot. We enjoyed both French Dip and Fish&Chips. Carmel pie was yummy. Great food,great service. New to area but we'll be back"}
{"text":"This is my family's second visit to O'Charley's in the last three or so months....while my family enjoys the reasonable prices and decent food, the service is HORRIBLE! 
Today we arrived about 6:15 and was immediately seated, we ordered our drinks which came relatively quick and our server, who I won't name because he was nice... nice AND slow, said there was four minutes on the rolls, which was no problem as we needed a few minutes to review the menu, he took his time and finally came back for our order... It was now 6:36, 20 minutes no rolls and when I asked, he said they were coming...ok?!?!? But he then sent another gentlemen in a suit who also informed us they were waiting for hot rolls, at which time my husband asked if they were waiting on a hot salad... as more than time had passed since we ordered our food. The salad came, the rolls and piece by piece our  entrees came out.  Unfortunately our waiter did not ever come to check on us once our food finally came to the table and we had to ask other tables for condiments. 
The food was fine and when we were done our waiter made his way over... Plates stacked up he did retrieve the Togo container I requested but never cleared a dish or brought the check. The mgr started to clear dishes and was informed of the slowest service ever which was a repeat of our last visit. He apologized and attributed it to an off night. 
After another 5 minutes or so the server brings the check. The bill gets squared away and I ask for change to leave a tip...the wait continued... 
Yes, I left a tip but NO, I will not return to this O'Charley's ever!!!!"}
{"text":"First negative impression: Walked in and stood there waiting while at least 3 employees looked at me and said nothing, no greeting, no attempt to help. Second negative impression: server called me \"babe\". Never a fan of strangers calling me something other than my name or \"ma'am\". She continued to say \"hun\", \"sweetie\" throughout my dining experience. On the positive side, her service was good. The buttermilk chicken tender salad was delicious. No concerns about cleanliness. I would return."}
{"text":"Service is getting better at this place but still has a way to go. Our server was attentive and the rolls and appetizers came out quickly. After that, the meals took a while to come out. The place was not very busy but our server seemed to be covering most of the restaurant alone. My mother enjoyed her birthday lunch. We ordered a variety of dishes which were all basic American fare. Nothing to write home about and no major complaints."}
{"text":"I like this place. The bread is amazing, service is OK, and I wish they would Bring back the ribbon fries  I loved them"}
{"text":"Good American food, plain and simple. No surprises here. Service is good; got in, got seated and got food within 30 minutes. Not bad, though the price is a bit much for the type of food. Honestly, if I want American ill just make the drive up the road to rockne's."}
{"text":"This weekend I came to dinner with a group of 7. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated on a Saturday night which was understandable for a large party and on a homecoming night. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food quite a bit and the service was good at well. I ordered the cowboy sirloin with a baked potato and Caesar salad. My steak was cooked medium rare perfectly and although I asked for sour cream on my potato I only received butter. The salad was good as well. I love that they put dressing on the salad and bring extra on the side for those who would like more. The server was pleasant although it took a long time to get enough bread at the table for all of us (they only gave us 4 loaves to start with). Overall I was pleasantly surprised with this visit compared to a previous one. I will most likely be back in the future."}
{"text":"45 min wait. Yet they have open clean table and also 8 dirty tables that need to be cleaned. Lazy hostess just leaning on the stand talking to her personal friend on the phone"}
{"text":"Oh, Charley's!  Today was not your day. The nieces picked you because of your queso. We got the queso, but quite frankly, I'm surprised. 
To be fair, Sunday brunch may not be the best time for casual dining. The wait was fair at around 40 minutes, but I was quoted 20-25. In addition to this big miscalculation, the hostess was a bit rude when I initially showed up. She engaged me and started taking my info. A couple came up to the hostess stand while this was occurring and she abandoned me to take care of them. It wasn't very hospitable. There wasn't enough room in the waiting area, so we waited outside. It was 40F...chilly, but at least the sun was out I guess. I kinda wish my party didn't want that queso. 
When we were about to be seated, an apology was made that we would be sat in a booth that was going to be a tight fit for our party of 8. It was. It was clearly meant for 6. Plus, there were only 6 place settings. Wasn't until long after the appetizers were brought that we could get silverware, despite asking twice. 
That might have been excusable. What really wasn't was that it took about 20 min for the waitress to even come ask for drink orders. She was there taking care of the surrounding tables. I guess she wanted to make sure we had enough time or something?  When she did come, we asked if we could order off the main menu instead of the brunch one and she walked away (in her defense, she came back). It was odd. 
Every course had something forgotten. My sister waited about 10 min after we all got our food to get hers. It was ready, but since no one checked back on us after the runners brought food out...well it happened that every course got delayed about 10-15 min. 
The queso, the queso!  Not that good. The nieces actually like the fries that come with it. They were kinda mushy. They enjoyed it still. 
The only thing i enjoyed was the pretzels. I like the mustard sauce (also comes with queso). 
When we left, there were tons of empty tables and a full waiting room. 

For a place that touts their Sunday brunch, this was a big fail. 2 stars for the pretzels. Don't come here for brunch."}
{"text":"Went with my family and girlfriend two days ago.  The food was pretty good and also had good size portions for an affordable price.  However,  i ordered the catfish,  my girlfriend had some sort of shrimp pasta and so did my sister.  Unfortunately the three of us got food poisoning. Im assuming from the seafood. Other than that not a bad restaurant.  Especially for how new it is."}
{"text":"Warning: This will be frank!

After a few chips from the app that was included in our meal (no choice) found a hair that didn't belong to us. 

After saying; I want to return (to another location) to get Prime Rib - I was just reminded of all the farting that took place after the meal. It was consistent and smelly to say the least. I thought it was my body punishing me for going off the \"eat clean menu\" but nope it was mos def this meal. 

On to other measurable things: 

Potato Soup = worst I've ever had... 0 Stars
Bread = ok, they bring it right over ... 3 Stars
Prime Rib = flavorful                    .....   4 stars
Service - eh, ok. 
Ambience - nothing striking 
Price - average deal 
Location - OMG, I forget what Southern living is like but at least the strip malls are aplenty over this way. And a Sonic's off the interstate. 

Overall all - 2 stars 
But Diner beWare

FYI: because we had Prime Rib with just soup. Our meat (the entree) came before the water was provided. Ain't that's something?"}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided to dine in for dinner since we were nearby and haven't eaten at O'Charley's in quite a long time.  We were seated fairly quick and our waitress was very pleasant and attentive.  They have new menu items, entree combinations, and a $9.99 everyday menu list as well.  I ordered the steak and chicken tenders combination entree, which comes with two sides (not bad at all) and my hubby ordered the ribs and chicken tenders combination entree (w/two sides as well).  The food was prepared and delivered in a reasonable time and the hot yeast rolls were a plus, might I add.  I ordered my steak medium-well (but a little closer to medium) and it was prepared well-done and quite salty.  Rather than go through the hassle of waiting for another steak to be prepared, I ate what I could as I was quite hungry.  The chicken tenders were pretty good- a tad bit smaller in size from what I could remember from previously dining there, the fries were lukewarm, but the loaded potato soup was quite tasty.  

My husband enjoyed the ribs and chicken tenders and really didn't have any complaints.  Again, the waitress and staff were friendly and attentive- the manager even came by to greet us (which was when we first arrived).  Overall, I'm not too sure if we were too hungry to overlook anything else, but I know I'll probably pass on ordering a steak here in the future."}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you want a relaxing lunch.  Went there for lunch, had some books with me, ordered a cup of soup and a half salad, had about 6 bites of my salad, and the server brings my check, does not ask if I want anything else like dessert or a refill on my drink or a box since they were running me out.  I asked when she came back if I could have a refill since obviously I could not get dessert, a few minutes over the manager came over and said their policy is to give you your check immediately since they have such a large lunch business, asked him to please bring me a refill in a takeout cup and I would leave, seems like they would like to wait on the customers that are already there?  Felt very rushed."}
{"text":"I've been to other O'Charley's in the past - and, while I was never overly in awe of the food or the experience, I never had particularly bad things to say about it. You know, for a chain, it never struck me as being terrible. 

This opinion has changed after visiting the new location in Strongsville. First of all, what a depressing dining experience. It was dark and cold in the dining room. Looking around at the other diners, it felt like we were eating in the cafeteria of a Soviet Gulag. No one was talking, heads were down, slurping soup or shoveling bites of meat into their mouths in between depressed sighs. Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but keep in mind this is a dining room with very old black & white photos from the area adorning every wall. The picture that stared down at me as  I ate was of a class photo of little kids taken in the maybe the 1920's. Not one student or teacher in the photo was smiling. I mean, they looked so unhappy - it was as if they had eaten at this O'Charley's or something. While we are on the subject, a senior citizen was walking around the dining room looking at the photos. This in and of itself was fine (if a bit odd), but given the less than warm surroundings of this dining room, It really felt as if I had decided to plop down and eat dinner in the middle of the world's most uninspiring museum. 

That's great, but what about the food, you ask? Well, for this the highest compliment I can offer is that it was decidedly average. Not bad, but certainly not good. My wife ordered the chicken pot pie. This was probably the best of the things we ordered (though the bar was admittedly set pretty low). A nice, flaky crust, chunks of chicken, and an assortment of vegetables. It was, however, as hot as molten lava - which makes me wonder if it was warmed up in a microwave. I had a grilled chicken sandwich. It was as average as average can be - but it was cooked all the way through, so that was a win as far as I was concerned. My kids had a grilled cheese and fries. This should have been easy, but my god it was awful. Hard as a rock and burnt. My kids will eat grilled cheese for every meal and then ask for more, but in this case they were pretty much like, \"That's okay, I'll pass.\" The star of the show was O'Charley's delicious rolls. Served hot, these soft, slightly sweet, little doughy treasures almost made up for the otherwise lackluster affair. But a man cannot live on bread alone, so I cannot in any way, shape or form recommend this location.
 I'm not ready to declare the entire chain as being a must-avoid, but I can't imagine a situation where I would ever willingly pull up in an O'Charley's parking lot ready to get my grub on."}
{"text":"After seeing the many commercials of the new menu items, I just had to persuade the wife to take a little trip to the O.

She had the fried chicken salad and I had the Tuscan chicken w/ linguini.  Her salad was fresh, the chicken was plentiful, and the bacon was just an added bonus.  Now, my chicken was the most juicy and tender piece of chicken I have had in a while.  It was properly seasoned, and topped with cheese.  The portion sizes were perfect, and for the money, it was a great value.

Our server was very attentive, and kept our drinks full, while checking on us several times throughout the meal.

This visit will cause me to consider going back more often and as long as they continue putting out good looking food, as well as the quality of the product, we will once again be regulars.

It was a pleasure to eat here today, and we were treated very well by the staff.

{"text":"My wife and I went twice,once on opening weekend and today (7-6-16). If your into very clean,it is. it just opened!! We both had the same food both times,we had high hopes. Food is TASTELESS. Very bland. The rice pilaf was the best thing of our meals,you can't screw rice up to bad. The chicken,looked like chicken but very tasteless,the bacon mashed potatoes,BLAND AS HELL. The people that say to food is good,clueless!!! Go to Applebee's or tgifridays."}
{"text":"AH.. O'Charley's.  Seeing how the one by my old house closed down after a year or so, I didn't really have high expectations walking into this one for lunch during the work week (near my office).  When you walk in, it is eerily empty, but you get seated right away.  Mind you, this is on a Tuesday in the middle of the week, but I would think at 12:30, more business and diners would be coming through.

I'm not sure how old this location is, but it does have a mural on the wall - it's pretty impressive and it still has reference to the Charlotte Hornets Basketball team so... \"old\".

There are some lunch specials that involve some sort of 1/2 sandwich and soup... I went that route.  Food was good and the loaded potato soup was filling enough.  Our server was super nice, but it did take a while to settle the bill (which I found strange since the place was not busy at all).

Overall a great location for UNCC students to bring their visiting parents - I dunno if it will be anything more than that.  It will be on my lunch radar, but not too high on the list for the University Area."}
{"text":"I stopped here today for lunch because the line at Panera was out the door and I had a meeting right after lunch so I couldn't wait forever to eat.

I was hoping to find something healthy here besides fish and broccoli but came up disappointed.  You really have to either customize your meal a lot or remove things once they arrive to get it really healthy here because there is no shortage on butter, cream., sugar and fried foods here.

I had one of their savory lunch combos which consisted of a house salad with balsamic vinagrette dressing and a baked potato, sans the butter.  This was really average food.  The salad had tons of iceberg lettuce which has no nutritional value at all, croutons, cheese and just a cucumber slice and small slice of tomato.  Very little nutritional value here and then the dressing had added sugar which i didn't need.   

The only good point I will say is that the service was good from the hostess to our server.  We were greeted properly, they answered our questions and the food came out in a timely manner.  But I think it's time they realized people are trying to be more healthy these days and need to take a lesson from Ruby Tuesday and put more healthy options on the menu with all the added fat/sugar/salt, etc."}
{"text":"O'Charleys is your typical chain restaurant, with nothing special to offer in terms of food or atmosphere. They have some pretty decent entrees, even though I would probably not recommend going here for dinner.

I've only been here for lunch, & while the food is right above average, they don't have a good lunch menu. The portions are the same size as your dinner entrees, which means you'll pay the same price. I don't understand why places have a lunch menu if it's nothing different than the normal entree...but maybe that's just me complaining.

I usually only get the chicken tenders covered in BBQ sauce & the plate always seems so empty. Don't get me wrong, the meal always fills me up for lunch, but the plate just seems way too big & makes the entree look skimpy.

O'Charley's is your typical chain restaurant, not serving up anything spectacular or that will have you clamoring to come back for more. It's not a bad lunch spot, maybe a tad bit pricey, but I'd definitely suggest going here for lunch over dinner."}
{"text":"Sam's Cafe was closed, so I had to come here! I was disappointed and underwhelmed to be honest with you. Now I have even MORE trepidation about trying Le Peep (another chain). I wanted some steak so i went with the fresh asparagus (too wilted), chicken noodle soup (salty) and steak (overcooked). 

I won't be back. I tried to check in here on Yelp and it showed up on my phone as me checking in at Jupiter's. I wish I went to Jupiter's even though I prefer stuffed OR deep dish over thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Granted they have only been open for a week but an hour and half wait for the appetizer and entrees  (they came out at the same time) is inexcusable. The server was  nice but seemed to want us to rush our selection.   We might give them another shot in a month or so bit of they show no improvement, we're done."}
{"text":"Terrible service and substandard food at best. Was seated without delay, restaurant wasn't very busy, given menus and told a waitress would be with us momentarily. Proceeded to sit there for 10 minutes while multiple employees walked past and stood at the drink stand making jokes and carrying on. Got up to leave, wasn't stopped and asked what was wrong until we reached the door. Zero excuse for being blatantly ignored at the table. And bad waiters/waitresses wonder why they get bad tips"}
{"text":"Mashed potatoes were bad tastes like box mix and twisted chips had no seasoning. Purchased $9.99 special new menu item chopped steak and mashed potatoes and chicken tenders and twisted chips"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:45 to a fairly empty restaurant and were seated at 12:20.  Drinks came fast but food was slow.   My son spilled my tea and waitstaff stepped around it rather than helping.  I had to go to the wait station to get a rag.  The fish tacos were good, but the kid's Mac & cheese tasted funny, so I asked for kids pizza & applesauce.  It took so long to come that we boxed it to go.  Then we got the bill- charged for refills on tea (?!?) and $4.00 extra for kids sides of applesauce.  I said that was too much and they took the boxed food back and took out the applesauce.  We had four different waitstaff at our table over a two hour period.  When I told the manager on our way out that the experience was sub-par she smiled and said goodbye."}
{"text":"So after a bad experience last week we went back today. The GM Jason had reached out during the week to let me know how sorry he was about what happen. Today our server Dawn was amazing, the manager on duty was great, his name was Shaun.  Our drinks were never empty and the food was perfect. I'd like to say thank you for making it right and we will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst service restaurants I have ever been to. 37 min before anyone even asked us for water. I laid a 100.00 tip on the table and room 20.00  off the table every 10 min. Never go here if you want to eat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and waiter recommended honeychicken.
The chicken was raw in the middle. (gross)
New restaurant so I expect some mistakes from cooks.
We learn best from mistakes.
The waitress seemed very concerned but when she got the manger involved (which I was somewhat surprised) the manager told us that our entire meal would be paid for and to order some drinks and desserts.
The inconvenience of time and not eating our main course together(we had an appetizer first and the bread was delicious that was free)
was a small price to pay for being treated like we were important.
I will definitely be back because the food was actually really wonderful and the appreciation of the customer was over the top."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the fried cod and shrimp combo with bacon smashed potatoes and hush puppies. The atmosphere was nice. It is very family oriented. The rolls were awesome."}
{"text":"So I went to this O-Charley's recently for lunch. I had actually been to a different location for lunch before and tried out their awesome low country shrimp. So of course I wanted to give them another try. They're fairly matched from location to location in terms of food flavor and quality. I particularly like the mashed sweet potatoes. You don't find these everywhere but it's an awesome food concept that I think restaurants ought to be using more.

My experience this time around wasn't as good as before but it wouldn't keep me from coming back. Having come here for lunch, timing was key. But in that regard they lacked...horribly. Our waiter was fairly non-existent for the latter half of our meal experience. No refills and took several minutes to come back and take payment. Meanwhile, we were getting later and later for getting back to work.

On the food front, I tried something different: the tilapia from their $9.99 menu. My girlfriend had the peach chutney chicken. The chicken was flavorful and tasted great. The tilapia wasn't necessarily overcooked but it lacked any proper seasoning or flavor - it tasted dry and bland if not for the diced pico-like medley on top. I had to add my girlfriend's leftover balsamic dressing to it for flavor. I was also not thrilled with their standard for placing the side dish of mashed sweet potatoes on top of a napkin on the plate - the napkin got soggy and disintegrated into the rice and fish.

In any case, I like the idea of getting a free movie ticket with the purchase of two blue moon beers and two entrees. So I'll definitely have to pay them a dinner visit in the near future."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Ordered carry out tonight and had my husband pick it up on his way home from work..big mistake! I ordered the fried shrimp with mashed sweet potatoes, Cole slaw, and paid extra for the salad and pie. Also ordered the sirloin steak, steamed broccoli, and loaded baked potato (which was an up charge) and paid extra for the soup and pie. They forgot my Cole slaw, the soup, my cocktail sauce, butter for the rolls, and all the fixings for the loaded mashed potato. They also gave us two of the smallest pieces of pie I've ever seen in life. Called to speak with a manager and was put on hold for over 30 minutes. I finally gave up and decided to call back in the morning or stop by if they try to keep me on hold again. I don't pay over $40 for carry out to have key parts of the meal missing!!"}
{"text":"We don't often get to O'Charley's, but since we had a gift card, thought we would check them out. Unfortunately it was not on \"free pie\" day (which is Wednesday, in case you are wondering), but it was still a decent trip.

The sad part is that they seem to be on the decline - just as most of this sort of fast-casual restaurant seem to be. But the staff didn't seem to mind much (or perhaps they were just happy that we were there). So our order came out with a decent amount of speed, and the food was reasonable. Of course, when you're paying with free money, it always helps."}
{"text":"I've always had great service at this location. I've gotten to go orders as well as dining in. We always get the prime rib when we come here. It's cooked perfectly and we always get it medium rare. Fridays they usually have clam chowder soup and that's what I always get when I'm here that night. Soup is so good. It's thick and white based and has just the right amount of potatoes and clams. We also love their fried mozzarella pepperjack triangles. It's great with their spicy robust marinara sauce. You also can't go wrong with their chicken tenders and their ranch dressing is on point! 

If you sign up for coupons you will also get a good bit of 20% off coupons."}
{"text":"The bartender was very friendly and provided great service! Quality food at a great price. Big portions, great drink specials, and a relaxing atmosphere. I don't understand why it was so quiet on a weekend evening!?!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Cleanliness was fine. I got a half pecan crusted chicken salad and my husband got a half Caesar. My chicken was over cooked and bland. My husband said his was tender and well seasoned. Lots of options on the menu but mostly comfort foods and the typical Applebee's type fare. I guess people come just for the pie which we didn't have. Probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here with the wife and some friends. Not or first choice of places to eat but not the last. Service was a little slow but good enough not to complain about. The bread they give you before you order is excellent, especially if you can get a fresh hot order out of the oven. I had the chicken tenders and fries, wifey had the catfish. The chicken tenders are very good and wifey had no complaints about the catfish so I guess it was good to very good. Will return to eat someday again, food is not bad."}
{"text":"Horrible! We waited 40 minutes to get our drinks. Out of cups!! Really?? Food order took forever. Our waitress didn't show up until we had been seated for 30 minutes. 

No bread. Had to ask for it. Once she showed up, it took 15 minutes to get our drinks and bread.  Don't show up here expecting quick service!"}
{"text":"Nicole B and I walked 2.5 miles from our hotel because we knew we would be drinking.  They had some good fruity girly drinks I liked, and we shared potato soup which was really good.  We decided on the appetizer sampler because supposedly O'Charleys is known for their chicken fingers.  They were just like any other kids meal, and the potato skins were nothing special.  But the spicy jack cheese wedges were great.  They were something different and very tasty!  We then moved on to Wild Wing Cafe to spend the next 10 hours of our excursion that day.  We returned to O'Charleys later in the week for happy hour, and were very disappointed.  We had nachos which I thought were just gross.  Our friend had grilled salmon that he seemed to enjoy.  But it took almost a 1/2 hour to get our check and we had to go, terrible service!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location twice now. Once around Veteran's Day 2017 when I was in Charlotte for the NC Renaissance Festival and most recently the day after Christmas 2017 while visiting my brother-in-law.

I have no complaints. Both times we were seated in reasonable amount of time, received excellent service and the food was well prepared.

I'm sure on future visits to Charlotte, assuming we stay near this location, we'll dine here again."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant so expect that. No chef here. Lots of prepackaged food heated on site. Nothing memorable   Won't be back"}
{"text":"I got the roast beef sandwhich and it was really good.  The server was very attentive and the manager stopped by to see how are meal was. Overall, a nice experience. I would recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"I used to go to O'Charley's often back in 2005 while living in North Carolina and was always a fan. It recently moved into Strongsville and I have been wanting to try it again after all these years. We stopped in around 3:30pm on a weekday and sat at the bar! We were greeted by the fabulous Brandi, who has worked at some other bars in the area so I knew she would take great care of us! She gave us some recommendations and informed us of all the specials, happy hour, margarita specials, discontinued beer specials, app specials and her favorites! We started with a beer and a margarita! For apps, my boyfriend got the crab cakes, which were probably on my top five list of best crab cakes, super impressed. Then I got kettle cooked chips with a quest that was good, just very large. For entrees, he got a Salmon dish, with broccoli and sweet potato fries, cooked well and pretty tasty. I ended up getting a southern fried chicken salad, I made some modifications but it was super satisfying. Also, because we both got entrees we both got a free pie, took it to go, because it was just so much food. Overall, we had a good time, the food was tasty, but woah, huge portions!!!"}
{"text":"The main reason I go here is because of the Southern Pecan Chicken Salad (sans the bleu cheese crumbles).  My mom and I usually split a full order with the Balsamic vinaigrette on the side, which is more than enough.  This time around I tried the half size with a cup of the overloaded potato soup.  According to the server, the half size has the same amount of chicken as the whole size, but less salad - score!  The soup was so rich and creamy - you can taste the buttery, fatty goodness.

Usually the service is great, but today it was slow and just average.  It wasn't even the lunch rush yet!  Our server was very nice, however, she forgot the lemons for our sweet teas and did not refill our drinks during our entire meal.  She did apologize and gave us refills to go, but inadvertently switched my mom's drink with mine.  She also forgot my order of soup and had to bring that out later.

So overall I'd give it 2-stars compared to other places, but the salad deserved a star on its own (and maybe because they have free pie day every Wednesday)."}
{"text":"Went to this O'Charley's today with my boyfriend (on a Sunday around 5:30pm). We walked into the lobby and waited in line about 10 minutes to get to the host stand to be seated by the manager (who was very pleasant). 

They quickly cleaned a both for us and we sat down to wait about 5 minutes for a server to come greet us and take a drink order. When he did come over he was nice but seemed busy so we were patient. We waited about 5 minutes, again, for our drinks to be delivered and quickly ordered an appetizer (chips & queso) as well as our entrees (chicken tender & rib combo as well as bacon bourbon barbecue filet mignon) as we were starving by this point.

The server brought back some delicious hot rolls with butter and kept our drinks refilled. After about 15-20 minutes a different server delivered our appetizer and was kind and smiling. The chips were housemade chips with a light seasoning and were delicious with the queso.

After almost another half hour of waiting, our entrees came out. My ribs were good, a little fatty, but good. I got macaroni and cheese as my side and so did my boyfriend. They were both basically buttered noodles with shredded cheese melted on top. Meh.. My boyfriend really enjoyed his steak and baked potato and the fries I got (instead of the Caesar salad I ordered) were kind of soggy by the time I got to them but I liked the honey mustard dipping sauce.

Overall the staff was friendly, the food was good, but it took over an hour and a half from start to finish. Will be back soon to try again, hopefully with better luck."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant with her family hoping to have a nice evening together we intern got a corporate push you through as fast as you can vibe as soon as we were sad they were asking for our order..... tried to ask for a vodka tonic and he brought out a tall glass filled with ice. Tortilla soup looks like mush the steak was very chewy and fatty quite disgusted with the whole experience probably will not go again"}
{"text":"Went last night, had a good time. Nice place for a quick delicious meal. Rolls are baller, I always either get steak or salmon and it's always cooked and seasoned perfectly. They changed their broccoli a few years ago and it's not as good as it used to be. They have a great drink selection, so I got a mojito, which was not very good. Not like a mojito you would get at a real bar. So I asked if I could get my regular Skyy lemonade, the manager was very friendly and understanding. I was very happy about that. My only complaints are that our waiter didn't say anything to us as we got up and left, even though he was standing right there, also the booth we sat at had a giant hole in the seat. I'll always love coming here though."}
{"text":"I always get good customer service at this location. The food isn't always perfect, but never bad enough that I had to send it back. Like I said, the customer service at this location is why I will continue to give them my business. Every time I have eaten there, a manager has made a point to come out and make sure that everything is well."}
{"text":"The worst customer service at a restaurant I've ever been to. They clearly don't have your best interest in mind especially when dealing with your order. 

First and last time I'm going here."}
{"text":"If you're looking to fatten up....then this is definately the place to be. I mean seriously, the loaded potato soup is FATTENINGLY AMAZING! And I do love this place and wish to god they had one here closer to Chicago but apparently they only serve the hillbillies of the world (unless you go to Ohio, because they have 3 in the Cincinatti area!). 

But in all seriousness, the warm rolls they give you is great, the food is great, the service is friendly and willing to put up with an eccentric city boy like me, and its at an extremely reasonable price. 

I was going to give it 4 stars because of the locations, but then my mouth started watering when I saw Loaded Potato soup in one of the other reviews, so 5 it is! If you get to Champaign, or any other remote part of the US, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I wasn't planning to leave a review but after seeing all the bad remarks I had to put in my two cents.  We love this place and so do a lot of our friends.  We've always found the food to be great and the service prompt.  Most times one of the managers comes by to see that everything was okay. We're regulars enough that she remembers us.  This will continue to be one of our regular stops!"}
{"text":"Very good food this is one of my favor place to take the family. I have seen a lot of managers come and leave but the food remains the same very tasty with some good services."}
{"text":"Ordered filet medium. It came Over cooked  like shoe leather. They
, returned with second filet overcooked. Service bad, draft beer warm. Oh and the filet was to have a bourbon glaze with bacon. Well after they cooked it like shoe leather both times neither filet came out with the glaze or bacon.  The manager was like almost crying! Lack of supervision and checking of food before it goes out. Waitress did not know what kind of beer they have. Wont be going back"}
{"text":"I don't know why I go here.  Every time I have dinner here, the service is terrible and the food so-so.  Not a fan."}
{"text":"Brunch this AM at OCharley's. This is always a good choice for brunch if you can hold out until 10 AM on a Sunday. Good food and there usually isn't a wait to be seated. The hot yeast rolls are a good starter and the food usually comes out quickly. Always a good choice for the segway from breakfast to lunch."}
{"text":"I never dine at O Charley's. Not since high school. The interior has stayed untouched. What's the movie with Ryan Reynolds where he works in a restaurant? It looks EXACTLY like that inside. Everyone here was friendly. The place was super clean (bathrooms included). Waitress was on par. No one at the table was used to house salads not coming with shredded cheese like other steakhouses so by the time we all realized, the waitress made 2 trips back to the kitchen for it. We felt bad and left a higher too for the extra work haha. 

I ordered the prime rib, medium. It was sad. A good bit of fat and it just looked SAD. Maybe 6 oz.  for $15. The cook let it hang out on the grill until it was medium-well to the FULLEST extent. I didn't want to send it back since I hadn't had breakfast or lunch that day. The French silk pie was awesome and a good price.
I kept 1 star for having an amateur cook on the line on a Saturday night, and 1 for the price. They could make better food to keep customers coming back and maybe a small lit up sign at the actual turn inside the complex (the restaurant is buried behind the IHOP and Arby's). 
Cheers."}
{"text":"Hello Friends, 

I've been to this location many times. My gf bday was the other day and she desided to stop here for a little meal. 

The waiter was the life of the party.. (Other than myself of course). His tip increaser (if that's a word) was when the food was brought to the table. I'm a BIG FRY GUY and the 1st thing I noticed is that I had about 12 french fries. As everyone looked at my face and heard me count the fries. 1 person in the group asked, \"CAN YOU BRING HIM 4 MORE FRIES...LOL\"

well low and behold, 5mins later, the waiter brings a place with 4 count em, 1,2,3,4 fries. That got a kick out of the 8 member party. I lol'd so hard I couldn't think if he was tryin to be funny or carry out the wishes of a customer. It was tooo funny. 

I told him just for that.. he just increased his tip from me. 

The food was great, drinks were good as well. 

I'll Beee Baccckkk!!!!"}
{"text":"I would have given no stars but that was not an option! On Saturday night we made a reservation for 29 people. We showed up a few minutes early and were told they were cleaning up our tables and getting it ready for us. Another party arrived and claimed to have a reservation, yet the hostess could not find it. They asked to speak to a manager. The manager took quite some time to come talk to these people. They explained they had a reservation for 15 people that could not be located. He said they were cleaning off the back tables now and that they could have that area. My husband stepped in and said that we had made a documented reservation for 29 people and were told those tables were being cleaned off for us. The manage preceded to give away our table to the party of 15. Will never eat at O'Charleys again!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Rolls are great. Service was fine. Typical O'charleys. Love the chicken fingers. Margaritas were absolutely horrendous. Pretty sure it was water with a ton of ice. Tried to give them a second chance on my second margarita, even worse."}
{"text":"This is a new place for Strongsville. That said, it is clean and pleasing visually.

I was there for lunch with two other people. I had the meatball sub, and my friends had a burger and the other had the cajun chicken pasta.

Visually it all looked great. The meatball sub was mediocre. I've had much better. It was OK but nothing great. The fries were frozen, not fresh cut. My friends burger arrived with toppings that he specifically asked for it to come without. It was a good size and a good burger, just arrived wrong. My other friend enjoyed the cajun chicken pasta.

The service was OK, but did not wow us in any way.

Three meals and two mountain dews = $40. Kinda pricey.

It wasn't bad, everything was fine, it just wasn't anything above average in price, taste or service. Personally, I am not inclined to return."}
{"text":"A few months ago we ate here and it was fine.  Last night we had prime rib dinner & it was terrible.  The worst part was we both ordered 2 different soups as a side, and both were so full of salt, it was like they poured the whole pound of salt in it.  It gets worse - ordered potatoes with beef gravy - the gravy was full of salt and inedible just the same.  They need to fire the so-called cook - he surely is NOT a chef.  The hostess (Norrine) was excellent, and so was our waitress we tipped her 30% because SHE can't help what crap the cook serves).  If you want decent service, fine - but if you want decent FOOD, forget it.  We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Waitress was slow and didn't bring me change when I payed in cash saying, \"I'm assuming you didn't want change?...\" Even if I didn't it's not good to assume. Not to mention the bartending skills we're very subpar. It took 20 minutes for 4 margaritas that had absolutely no flavor. If you're going to be a bartender you should without a doubt know how to atleast make a margarita....let alone within a 10 minute time span on a slow Sunday night. The only thing that brought this up to three stars is that I had a good time with my bros."}
{"text":"Great southern American food with a menu full of options. At this restaurant I recommend anything fried. Most specifically I recommend their Southern Fried Chicken Salad. The decor is cute but the service can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"The complimentary rolls are addictive! You can't eat just one. The food is exceptional. The scenery is nice with a bar and some TVs."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely wonderful! I took my wheelchair-bound mother here for lunch a few days ago and every single employee treated her like royalty. We have had issues in the past with restaurant and other customer service employees treating my mother like a second-class citizen because of her wheelchair....NOT SO at O'Charleys!
The hostess was warm and graciously moved chairs out of the way for my mom's chair. Our waitress as well as three others AND the manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was good with our meal. 
I can't rave about the way my mother was treated enough. Four days later and she is still talking about how wonderful everyone was. This visit to O'Charleys ensures that my mother and I will return here every time we go shopping in Champaign. It totally topped her day!"}
{"text":"We arrived 3:00 for lunch, in the afternoon on Saturday.There were at least 30 people waiting. It was hard to find a place to park.
They were still able to seat us in 30 minutes. I had Tilapia with broccoli on the side. It was a huge portion, and though a little bland, a very healthy meal. The dinner rolls came late, but were warm and delicious. I will go back, anxious to try other entrees.
This is American Fare, and the only complaint I have is that there is far too much meat on the menu."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time, and all I had was eggs and bacon!

All the dishes the brought us were dirty, from the small plates that were already on the table when we sat down to the plates our meals came on. Everything was incredibly greasy, I could barely eat the eggs. My dad ordered three scrambled eggs and toast, and he was given eggs and bacon. My mom ordered her meal without potatoes, but potatoes came anyway. I asked for toast with my eggs and bacon, but was given two slices of bread, untested. They couldn't get the orders or cleanliness right. I'd suggest dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst food! Burger was greasy and flavorless! Service was horrible. Sitting at the bar they forgot my husbands drink...really! We will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the cheesy sign/logo change that has rendered O'Charley's sub-par. I have been to this O'Charleys many times and it has been fine. However, last night we had a particularly bad experience. It was my Dad's birthday so we took my parents out for dinner. Sunday night. 6PM. The restaurant wasn't too busy so we got seated pretty quickly. Our server came over and took our drink order promptly. My husband ordered a Sam Adams and my Dad ordered a Bud Light Long neck. The waitress brought over the the Sam Adams in an oddly shaped, special Sam Adams glass and a Bud Light. In a glass. The Sam Adams glass was smaller on the bottom and larger on top so perhaps this was why the glass toppled off of the tray and ALL OVER my Dad. All over his shirt and pants. Great start to the meal. We all began scrambling for our rolled up napkins/silverware. The waitress had to run to grab more napkins and you could see from her face that she was upset. She apologized profusely. We all understood which is why I will not mention her name. It was an accident. The glass was top heavy. She's a young girl trying to make a buck. We get it. She left to get another beer for my Dad. We reiterated \"Bud Long Neck\"!

Then the manager came over.

What I have a problem with was the way the manager handled the situation. He came over to the table and led with a joke. \"I guess our waitress thought you needed your clothes washed or a maybe a bath?\" My Dad said it would be good if they had a dryer. Ha ha ha's all around. Then he asked if my Dad was okay and if he needed anything. 
My Dad said that he was fine. The manager thanked him for his understanding and good humor. As my Dad continued to try to sop up the beer from his clothes.  And that was it. No offer to comp my Dad's meal or even the beer at the very least. 

We ordered our meals. Three of us ordered the Southern Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad. 45 minutes had passed since we'd been seated and just about the time I was ready to ask how long does it take to make a salad and a piece of fish fillet (my husband's order) the meal finally came. I order this salad every time I go to O'Charley's and it's usually very good. Last night,  the chicken was way over cooked and it had a very slight burnt taste plus the chicken was lukewarm at best. What I normally like about the O'Charley's Pecan Chicken salad is that the chicken is served warm over the cool romaine lettuce. My parents said that their salads were okay. 

When the bill came I had thought perhaps they would not charge us for my Dad's meal but nope. I thought wrong. I think they even charged us for his beer. They did not charge us for the extra incorrect beer that the waitress had initially brought in a glass which nobody drank anyway. 

We all thought that the manager was at fault for not handling the situation better. I mean, the salad cost $10.  We eat at O'Charley's frequently. We didn't want to press the issue as we had set out to have a nice dinner and did not want any more static. It was the managers place to offer to make it right and he FAILED. My parent's don't want to go back there. My husband was so pissed that he said he wouldn't go back there. EVER. He's a man of his word. With Chili's, Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday, TGIFriday's  and Carino's nearby there's really no reason to."}
{"text":"They cannot cook and their portions are small....If you want mediocre food Knock yourself out"}
{"text":"It's a nice neighborhood place to grab a decent lunch or dinner. I've eaten here 3 or 4 times and never had a bad meal. The service is always spectacular. It's a little noisy and often gets really busy around dinner time. Anytime we can't decide where to go for a meal, we usually end up here because of the wide menu selection and the good food."}
{"text":"I am giving this visit a strong 4. I had the waffle combo with scrambled eggs, and bacon. The eggs were wonderful, the bacon was decent, and the waffle was hard. It didn't taste terrible, it was just hard. 

Our server Karissa was very attentive and tried her hardest to make this a good experience. Her dedication was very much appreciated. 

I don't think I've ever been to an O'Charlie's, so i don't really have anything to compare it to. Either way, i thought this was a good meal with great service. I think i might be back."}
{"text":"I went tonight with my wife and I ordered their 16oz. prime rib done medium. What I got was what started out as medium, then thrown on a flat top to heat it. It came out medium well with a  fried surface. Not very appetizing and I wouldn't order this again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the pies are spot on. I love coming here and the staff are great."}
{"text":"Fabulous place to eat, watch the game and chill. Family style restaurant with a touch class. Management is awesome...."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cobb salad and got a Cobb salad with tangerines, cranberries, and candied pecans. I have a nut allergy. The manager wanted me to come back and get another salad. No!  I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"We have been here for over an hour and a half waiting for a large table...we would have left but didn't want to disappoint my son on his birthday!  Very hard to expect 7 children to sit and wait! We have been told there is only one place to seat a large party! Very frustrating! Good good but hostesses were very unaccommodating!"}
{"text":"So this was my first trip in a long time to the university location mostly due to poor service as of late.  To my surprise it was delicious.  The waitress was polite, helpful, and attentive.  I had the black and blue Caesar salad.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Weeknight evening, nice menu with traditional 'American' fair.  Meal was hot and fast; good portions; will choose again."}
{"text":"Ok....first time here.  The artichoke dip GREAT.  THE DOWNSIDE?  The tortilla chips made in old oil. Tasted like eating play doh.  Complained to manager and he gave us a 10%  discount on bill. The rest of meal was GREAT. The prime rib tasty and well made. Will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here a few weeks ago and we have to say, it was great. We had a not so great experience a while back and decided to give it another chance. We were shocked at the difference. The manager came over and talked to us. The server was attentive to our needs even though she was extremely busy. The ribs were AMAZING and I don't ever say food is amazing. Price was good. We got two appetizers, two entrees and dessert and it was under $50. The fried cheese was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here in awhile and after tonight's visit we will not be back.  There was an odor outside and a little inside and we later figured it out that it smelled like old, nasty grease.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich and it was disgusting - I couldn't even eat it - I left 2/3 of it on my plate and the waitress never even asked if I liked it.  And, to top it all off my husband and I are both sick feeling now because we think their grease was old."}
{"text":"Convention be damned. I will say it loud and say it proud \"I love O'Charley's\". This location is close to my house and it has served me well. If you want to go eat somewhere that it doesn't matter what you are wearing or how loud your party is than you are in the right place. They also have a surprisingly good Prime Rib dinner on Friday, Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"We had the prime rib!  ''Twas good.  Cole slaw was good and our salads were too.  I would recommend the salmon and honey glazed chicken which our friends had and said was delish!  The rolls were a treat...sorta like a Hawaiian roll."}
{"text":"Decent food, sometimes feel ignored, but hey, can't beat the rolls! The bar area is nice and everything is pretty standard fare, as far as American Food goes."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff in Cuyahoga Falls.  From the hostess, to the server, to the on duty manager, every employee was friendly, attentive and genuinely enjoyed being there.

The restaurant was bright and clean and the food is always good quality. As far as chain restaurants go, O'Charley's is at the top of their game in regards to food quality, customer service and restaurant atmosphere.  Well done O'Charley's staff, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch today with quality service. They asked our party of 2 to sit at the bar, but in return offer us free items. Food was quality for the price and was well rationed."}
{"text":"After my second visit, I've decided I probably won't be back to O'Charley's without serious convincing.

Our first visit was their opening weekend and everything went horribly. Our server and the manager were very nice, but there were problems with 7 of 8 orders and our bills were wrong. That happens opening weekend, so we went back in August. 

My food was brought out wrong twice. The server, while friendly, clearly did not know the menu. There were too many people running food and stopping that they couldn't provide very good service. 
The food is decent and the menu is great, but after two disappointments I'm not sure I'll make the trip again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times for lunch and dinner. The food is very tasty for a chain restaurant. I have had their ribs, which fell off the bone. The Philly sandwich for lunch and soup and chief salad all very good.  You must try the donuts for desert. Recommend if you are in the Chapel Hill area."}
{"text":"It pains me to give only one star to what normally is such a consistent chain restaurant. We hadn't been to an O'Charley's in a while and were traveling through, so we stopped in for a drink and appetizer. From the outside it looked great with the new updated exterior.  

It was mid afternoon, about 2:30, so they weren't busy. Our waiter admittedly was new and didn't know much about the menu. The food came fast but there was a reason for that. It's because it wasn't prepared fresh. First, the fried pickles are terrible because they are made with hamburger dill chips. They were sour and had too much breading that wasn't freshly prepared. And the nachos were a disgrace. Chips thrown on a plate with liquid cheese poured sloppily missing most of the chips, with canned chili and a few tomatoes and green onions sprinkled on. Very sparse to say the least. We were hungry so we ate some, but then left quickly.

And when did O'Charley's change their rolls? The ones we were served were dry and dusty - no sweet, shiny coating. 

The restaurant inside was old and looked dirty, and the seats on our booth were ripped. It's badly in need of a re-do. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"First have to say the food was great. Really great Chicken tenders and lots of affordable options. Now the bad.  Told we had a 45 minute wait which turned into 1 hour and 45 min.  If it wasn't my nephews choice for his birthday dinner we would have left and we observed many leaving. Staff was dry and appeared overworked.  Waiter was nice but also overworked and shared he had not break all day.  Manager, Ralph i think comes over and as i try to share how long we waited but please do something to make my nephews birthday a good experience. He hardly makes eye contact and awkwardly walks away.  Sadly the great food can not eclipse the horrible service.  No explanation for the extra wait and no solution minded staff.  One and done."}
{"text":"Another good meal, however, my steak was a good medium-rare when it was supposed to be medium. After a reheat, it was a little closer. First problem I have had here."}
{"text":"When we came in we had to wait 10 min to be greeted and the hostess looked very irritated that we were there. Very very sad they changed their rolls, the new rolls they have don't taste nearly as good (which the rolls is the only reason we wanted to go). We got the potato soup which was very good, super thick-not much like soup but cheese sauce. For our entree we got steak and chicken tenders. The steak was AMAZING, the best steak we have had in a very long time. The tenders were kinda burnt and not that good. The mashed potatoes were incredibly good. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Overall good but very very sad about the different rolls."}
{"text":"O'Charley's used to be one of our favorite restaurants, mostly for the rolls that they serve before dinner.  They are delicious. 

This particular franchise however, has slowly declined in quality and customer service over the past 10 years or so.  I would assume due to poor management.   

We visited tonight, and although the restaurant wasn't busy, you would think by the service and attention we got, it was.  The management seemed uninterested in whether tables were actually happy.  They came by, said \"Everything good here?\", barely waited for a response, and then walked away.   Multiple times they could have helped refill drinks or check on why our food was taking so long to come out.  Our server seemed as though she was very busy and stressed.  Everything was slow.  

The food was dismal.   Rolls were the only thing we actually enjoyed.   It was free pie Wednesday and even those were underwhelming.  

We will make it a point to find an O'Charley's franchise owned by someone else, or just not go.  

Sad decline of a once decent restaurant."}
{"text":"A local chain in the Cleveland area O,Charley's is a welcome establishment that offered something for everyone. It is clean and welcoming and offers a sit down dining experience or a casual bite at the bar. The staff is friendly and educated and makes you feel welcome right off the bat. The atmosphere I would describe as in between a Bar Louie and an Olive Garden, I might be way off but that's what I got out of it. Can't go wrong by stopping in for a bite or a cocktail, either way you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! My daughter and I have been wanting to try out this place since it opened. We attempted today and had the most obnoxious waitress ever. Practically laying on our table taking our order trying to be bubbly. She then tried to push my daughter into getting a dinner sized portion of the chicken fingers when she clearly said the appetizer. Then my daughter sat there with no drink for over 1/2 her meal. To top it all off she closed out someone else's check with my card then ran my card twice... $75 for lunch today is not what I had planned. Asked for the manager and never saw one. Won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed - medium rare prime rib came out looking like beef jerky - dried out dark brown. Sent plate back and on return next piece was practically raw and none of my sides included.  Manager offered dessert for free...how about giving me an actual dinner?  Won't go back.  Better places in town than this for beef."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today. Wasn't busy as we got there just as they opened. Got our rolls but think they might have been reheated, didn't seem very hot to me. Potato soup seemed runnier than normal. Overall it was an ok meal. We normally go here about once a month. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food very much. Service started off a bit slow since we waited a bit before anyone even came to seat us, but after that our server was very friendly, very helpful. 

The food itself was great too, I had the cat fish dinner and the potato soup. The catfish was well seasoned and the soup, that soup was tasty. Oh we had the fried green tomatoes, also very good.

Not everything was perfect, we had a few hiccups but the server was quick to fix any of the small issues.  Manager even came over once to make sure we were OK, I thought that was nice.

I'm giving 4 stars because I feel they could be a bit better prepared, it wasn't packed or anything when we got there, so not coming over to seat us right away gave a bad first impression.  We were also sat without any utensils, which again, at a busy time I can understand. 

I'm not a food critic so I can't really explain why the food was good, I just know I personally really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Restaurant Update:
I never had a chance to write about my 3 experience here which will be the last. I had enjoyed all my visits up until this last trip a few months ago which left a very sour taste in my mouth. They newly introduced a children's menu which on the top of the menu states includes a children's drink. We had our prime rib dinner for two which was great. My son tried the mac and cheese which was okay for 3.49 what could you ask for along with a cup of milk. When we received the check they charged us for the milk which I thought was a mistake. When we spoke with the waitress she argued that yes it is \"included\" but you have to pay for it. This is simply crazy, how can something be included and yet you get charged for it. I told her to go talk to the manager. After 5 minutes she came back and told me that the manager would take it off this time. I was irate that somehow the manager did not understand how a children's menu works. Somehow she made me feel like a criminal trying to get out of paying for my kid's drink. When we were leaving I asked another waitress do they routinely charge for kid's drinks and she said she didn't know and in my anger I decided to ask for the manager. She comes over and tells us hopefully that did not ruin the meal, but the staff needs to be better educated. At no time did she apologize for her own misunderstanding of the kid's menu or clarify whether kid's drinks are included or not included. I ended up writing a letter to complain to corporate to re-educate and to not rip off other customers when they order the kid's menu item. I got a phone call telling me sorry, but due to the poor handling with the initial experience I am done with O'Charley's."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic. I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta, it was to die for. The chicken was grilled to perfection and the sauce was creamy and spicy. The beers we ordered were served in frosted glasses and tasted great. My husband ordered the filet mignon medium well and it was also cooked to perfection. For an appetizer we had the fried green tomatoes, they were interesting definitely not the traditional way I'm used to having them. Excellent professional waiter who did a great job. Awesome experience, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The family and I made a last minute decision to go out to dinner tonight. Decided on O'Charleys since we've never been there before and the menu looked appetizing. We ordered the Steak & Crabcake, Fish & Chips, and Cajun Chicken Pasta. 

First off, the service gets 5/5. I forget our servers name now but he was fabulous. Never let our drinks run out. Kept the refillable drinks full. Didn't hover or crowd the table. He did awesome. 

The Steak & Crabcakes get a 5/5 for plate size and taste. This was ordered with the pilaf a baked potato. The steak was cooked perfectly to order, Crabcake was tasty and mild in flavor. Sides were flavorful and not dry at all. 

The Fish & Chips get a 4/5. The fish was good and flaky but I wish it was crispier. Not much else you can say about fish and French fries. 

The Cajun Chicken Pasta sadly gets a 2/5. It wasn't horrible but I definitely wouldn't advertise it as \"Cajun\" or as having a \"spicy Cajun sauce\". While the pasta was cooked correctly and the flavor of the peppers (green and red, not spicy peppers) does come though in the sauce, there just wasn't anything about the flavor that I'd call Cajun. I hate to say but the Parmesan Shrimp Pasta at Ruby Tuesdays has more of that flavor than this dish had. I think maybe if the chef was a little heavier handed on the seasoning or maybe if the chicken were blackened in it then added to the pasta you would get more flavor. The manager did tell us that most people love this dish with no complaints so maybe it was an off day for the chef. I'd say if you do decide to order this then maybe ask for more seasoning if that's possible. The Bayou Shrimp Pasta has this same sauce (I believe) so maybe it's mixed beforehand."}
{"text":"Visited on a busy Friday night with a large party for a wedding rehearsal dinner. Service was fine, meals were A-Ok. The beverage menu looks very much like the one for Ruby Tuesday, which prompted me to look up corporate info.  Both seem to have roots in Tennessee, and perhaps have a contract with the same beer-wine-spirits distributor. However it all works, the house chardonnay was good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chain restaurants when I'm in the area. Always look forward to the rolls.... 

\"I'll go get you some rolls as you look at the menu.\"

\"The rolls will take 5 minutes to come out.\"

Get my meal first 1 minutes after I order.....

Half way through dinner I hear her tell the table that just say down \"ill be right back with the rolls\"
She passed me and paused \"did you still want those rolls?\"
A very stern \"NOPE!\" rolled out of my mouth.

No apology nothing.

Manager made his way over to me asking how everything is and offered a slice of pie but by then I was getting ful and didn't want any.  He apologized too.  

Still one of my favorite chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We don't do chain restaurants often. But you know I kept seeing the commercial for their prime rib special and it suckered me in.

So we of course ordered the prime rib special and it was definitely affordable. Our food wasn't bad, it was just average. Nothing I would rant about, nor anything I would rave about either.
The prime rib wasn't bad, definitely not the best meat or best cut - more like a sirloin amped up with injections. 

Those rolls though - I was not prepared for that. I mean hot, buttery bread is always good right?

Our service was a bit slow - I didn't understand because it was not busy at all. I don't know if our server was irritated because she kept rushing us to order and we weren't ready. It was a big menu and our first time and I wanted to look it over. So after she took our order, we never really saw her."}
{"text":"Kids eat free everyday all day that's the only reason why we go. Do not get the artichoke and collards dip its horrible. Nice wait staff though lol."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The food was just \"okay\" and service was less than be desired. I wanted to really like this place but just couldn't. I'd try it again bc it's wasn't terrible but not anytime soon"}
{"text":"Pretty reliable for normal American favorites. Not spectacular but at least a little better than a lot of the other choices nearby."}
{"text":"Decided to try O'charly's with our neighborhood group of 8. 
This evening. Sat down fast because there was no body else in the place. Waitress was nice, that's it. Service was slow because she told us she had too many tables. Our orders were mixed up, food was prepared wrong and had to be sent back, no refills on coffee or water. Then the check were all mixed up. Not going back."}
