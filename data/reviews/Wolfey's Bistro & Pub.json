{"text":"Best spot in Elyria, recommend the baked mac n cheez, Dan is a great server super fun dude! Cool looking atmosphere, live bands, patio seating in the back, overall would recommend if in Elyria."}
{"text":"This is a cool place I found in Elyria. Originally I was not a fan as we had an average meal and service in the dining room. As I remember this place was a landscaping center.  I have since gone back and found the food and drink options much improved.   I typically only sit at the large bar and get great service. The staff knows not only the food selections but also the beer. These guys have stepped up and have some great craft brews in the bottle and on tap. This time they had the great Lakes rye of the tiger. This stuff is in testing and cant be bought in bottles that I know of. I am a huge IPA fan and recently  have been into the RYe IPA. Founders is my fav. Great lakes needs to bottle thiers. It is awesome. Similar to the Lake erie monster but with a bit less alchohol and smoother hops.   The chef here always has a home made special that we usually get. I have had the meat loaf and was impressed.   My stand by here is now the Garlic parmesan wings that you dip in the hot wing sauce. The hot sauce has to go on the side.   The wine selection is above average for a place like this. the Crush is good stuff  If you want a casual meal and go early you can bring the kids."}
{"text":"Most of the dishes I have ordered from here were really good. I like that they have booths, stools with high top tables and a bar to sit at. The service has been good but not necessarily outstanding. It can get very loud, to the point where you have trouble having a conversation with someone at your table but it is a sports bar after all."}
{"text":"I have been there several times and have never had a bad meal there.  We have been there for lunch with delicious inexpensive lunch specials,and for a steak dinner, which was very good.  The restaurant is very clean, and the wait staff was great.  We did not have to wait long for any of our meals."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, dinner, or happy hour. Nice ambience. Been here for work-related socials mostly."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, was kind of cold inside, especially with the fans blowing.  They have many different flavors of beer in bottles and great lakes on tap.  Food was a little overpriced for the amount and quality of food.  I had a Philly cheesesteak and the bread was quite crispy.  Other than that it would be a nice place to hang, happy hour deals are good."}
{"text":"Wolfey's is my go-to place around here.  The food is always good, they always have a good selection of beer and the service is consistent.  The only downside is this place can get very busy and we've walked out several times because the wait was too long or we couldn't sit at the bar.  Definitely try the Mac and Cheese there, the Mozzarella Bruchetta and the pizza.  Always good choices!    They have a nice to-go service too!"}
{"text":"High quality great food every time. The great food makes up for the mediocre service."}
{"text":"Service can be good at times have certain managerial positions which are lacking good leadership qualities"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, chill atmosphere.  The location is kinda weird bc it's almost like a strip mall but that's besides the point. Went for dinner last night with my bf. Sat in the window looking at the parking lot and was not cold at all which was very nice. We started with the mozzarella bruschetta app and it was good! Just enough food for the two of us and the taste was on point. My bf ordered the Cajun chicken pasta and I had the seafood trio pasta. Both were piping hot, large portions and were delicious. I seriously enjoyed my grapefruit ale which the server explained was a rotating shandy flavor made by a subsidiary of  Miller. I can't remember my servers name but he was attentive without being overbearing. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent wings!  They are huge and very meaty.  Pleasantly surprised.  My husband can normally eat a dozen no problem- not here. I highly recommend the bone-in wings"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and have attended birthday dinners.  They make good drinks and the service is very good from the moment you walk in the door. I'm not a fan of any food I've ordered yet. My last meal was a burger, which was good till I took a second bite that was extremely salty and the next bite had no seasoning.  Perhaps a mistake or an off night, but couldn't enjoy it... Try the bruschetta, but be warned that it comes with fried mozz, not fresh.. I'll go back there because I like the ambience and it's a good place to catch up with people for a drink. I'll let you know about my next visit!"}
{"text":"I love their food and bar here. However the service needs work. Don't eat here if you have a schedule to be on."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight with some friends for a couple of drinks and a bite to eat. As usual, the service was outstanding - from the hostess stand, to the bar, to the waitress at our table.  The drinks were tall and strong and the food is much better than just bar food.  And, bonus - great live music with Jacob Frisch. Well done, Wolfey's."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place... in Elyria?! Yep! That's correct! It's on the corner of a shopping plaza but you know what people say, they say places in plazas have the best food. Well if you love Stromboli or pizza this rings true!  My date and I sat at the bar and had wonderful service. They have a great draft and bottle selection. I didn't care for the patio because it wreaked of smoke. There was nowhere for the smoke to go so we couldn't sit outside with the smell.  We ordered the deep fried pretzel sticks which if my metabolism wasn't slowing down, I would eat every single day! They stayed soft even when they cooled down and who doesn't love some good runny orange cheese! Seriously soooo good! We each also ordered a Stromboli. Holy amazingness! I loved the dough the best if I had to choose one ingredient to love more than others. I also used the ranch more than the marinara and this might be a foodie no no, but I broke the rules this time by using ranch. Either way these things are crazy good and no, you should not share!  *Note: You don't need extra cheese because these bad boys are fully loaded!"}
{"text":"Each and every time I eat at Wolfey's my food and drinks are delicious!! I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Boothang and I came for a late dinner on a weekday so we were seated immediately. Service was friendly and straightforward.   The menu was HUGE and EXTENSIVE. So many options! I had trouble picking something but ended up ordering the Morning Glory burger and a glass of cab.   The fries that came with the burger was AMAZING. Super crispy with crunchy flakes. The burger was yummy and large. The wine went will with the burger too. The prices were fair.   Will be up to come back and try more options!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's the BEST place in Elyria to grab a burger and a beer! The burgers really are spectacular... and it just starts there. Calzones, Flatbread pizza, Sweet potatoe fries... just some of our favorites.  Casual atmosphere and  always good service! :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Tried the Cajun Quesadilla - awesome. Great service - front reception and waitress. They even had Yuengling and Fat Tire - my favorites. Will be back here."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite I work across the street and order here all of the time. The steak sandwich is my fav now definitely a bang for your buck. This is an awesome place to have some drinks and a bite to eat! Prices are reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Enjoying the pub atmosphere - delicious Classic Reuben sandwich. Good selection of crafts beers. The homemade Cole Slaw has just enough black pepper to make it deliciously different. This place gets busy so you may wait if you're not there early."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food here is always good and the staff is nice. If you go here I recommend the pasta"}
{"text":"We love this place. Unfortunately this is my first review. Not for any particular reason, just we know our food will be hot, delicious and cooked to order. The 2 pictures I posted were of two new dishes on the menu. Both were delicious! If you haven't been yet, stop by. It's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Great appetizers and starters. We had the pretzels sticks and their signature chips and French onion dip. Very good stuff! I had the Stromboli and the dough was really soft and sweet. My husband said the wings were pretty good as well. We will be visiting again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent Local Food & Drink Joint, just East of downtown Elyria, Ohio is a great place with a full menu of delicious food choices & plenty varieties of brews & mixed drinks.  We prefer to go on weekdays in our regular rotation. Wolfey's has awesome daily food & drink specials like our favorites, Burger (Wed) & Taco (Tues) nights, as well as other daily specials.  You will not regret any menu choice, but I'd recommend a Burger or Stromboli as sure shot satiation!  Beer selection is also always amazing!  We eat out as a family a few nights per week and a couple lunches.  We'd eat here anytime, but weekends can be busier, crowded, & louder than other days.  Service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food!! They have a large menu with anything you could possibly want.  Service is fast and friendly!!"}
{"text":"never fail that i will end up here. great staff, great food, great environment! parking is a little annoying sometimes, but other than that i've never had a problem here and i 100/10 recommend Wolfeys!"}
{"text":"Food: fine.  Nothing totally out of ordinary.  Side salad wasn't iceberg lettuce and that's a plus.  My turkey wrap on smaller side.  Service: fine  Ambience: lower scale sports bar  Value: 4/5"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu, with a wide selection as well for drinks. Has a nice patio are for the summer months. Great staff who is very friendly."}
{"text":"Wolfey's is alway a good pick. The food and service are always great. It's an excellent place to meet friends and watch a game!!"}
{"text":"First time here and will DEF be back!! Got the Lobster Melt for lunch and I thought it was amazing!! Hot, soft, and fresh....and the homemade chips were very yummy. They were super busy cause it's Friday at lunch, but we sat at the bar and had fantastic service from the male bartender (ugh don't know his name!). We never felt ignored and never waited for anything and he was BUSY! Very good for my first visit and we will be back!! Loved it."}
{"text":"Really was looking forward to this place. First off couldn't find parking. This place is situated with a bunch of other businesses and parking was nill. Once we parked way down the street we got in there and ordered burgers. Mine tasted like charcoal and was burned, my husband's tasted like nothing. The food here is not worth the price at all. I rarely write reviews for bad food, but this was so bad and overpriced that I had to."}
{"text":"This place was great had the chicken bruschetta. Surpassed expectations for a \"pub\". If you're passing through I would recommend to anyone. If I'm in Elyria again I will be here."}
{"text":"The menu has a huge variety and there is something for everyone to eat! The homemade chips were delicious, tots, wraps, and amazingly huge salads with hefty toppings. But lorddddd the stromboli, THE STROMBOLI!!! HEAVEN, its seasoned with herbs on top and a good crisp but filled heavily with toppings so its still oh so cheesy! We were so full after splitting this we basically took our whole entrees home. Everything tasted amazing and prices were so reasonable we are so excited for our next time back and trying to come up with excuses to travel this far just to eat here!! I think we will do stromboli to split and half size salads!  I love that they do happy hour specials every day of the week. It really encourages people to come in and choose certain items. We enjoyed reduced price on Stromboli $7 and house bloody Mary $3! that is so so cheap! Look around on the walls everywhere for the daily deals and the happy hour deals.  However we were upset that the bill came back without the deal prices on both the Stromboli and the bloody Mary. It was fixed once on one item but not correctly, then was fixed again for the other item but not the right amount, we just decided it wasn't worth the back and forth anymore and paid the bill and left. Something they need to double check in the computer system because it should automatically ring right prices on certain special days and times! If it weren't for this billing difficulty this place would have had 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with co-workers a couple times. Huge place with plenty of seating. The first time service was quick but the second time was a lot slower but it was also a lot more busy.   I've tried their chicken dumpling soup, full Cobb salad, and turkey club sandwich. Skip the soup, it was tasteless but the salad was huge and was extremely good. Turkey club came with chips and loved the fresh made chips."}
{"text":"Good food, service, atmosphere!  Awesome!  I love  This place!  I have been there now 3-4 times and the experience has always been good!  They have a huge menu that accommodates the entire family!  The service has been amazing, and the food has been absolutely wonderful!  Great job, Wolfe's keep it up!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of natural light! The building used to be a greenhouse so all the old windows are still there.  Food is good. Portions are beyond massive. One meal can feed at least two adults. This place is really popular in with people in Elyria. Good place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We were staying in the little town of Elyria before heading to a campground the following day. Again we pulled up Yelp to find places to go that were near by and man were we happy with this one. The menu has a lot so it honestly was a little overwhelming, but they had $3 bloody mary's and we grabbed a jacket and stayed. I had an amazing burger and sweet potato fries and my friend had boneless wings (I want to say the garlic ones) and he said they were fantastic as well. The service was great and the music was loud, the place wasn't too busy for a Saturday night. But this place is definitely a find and something I will recommend to anyone in the area or driving through."}
{"text":"Great food, really decent prices and a very wide selection of beers and wine. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The menu here is great.  We have been 3 times and each meal was well worth coming back.  The inside is huge which was a surprise."}
{"text":"Love their patio and friendly staff.   Great atmosphere,  great people, good food and good prices on everything!"}
{"text":"Overall the food at Wolfeys has been very good but my most recent sandwich the South of the Border was a disappointment. I was expecting a nice juicy chicken breast with guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream as a topping.   What I got was a piece of chicken pounded thin and dry that was soaked in the above mentioned toppings.  It was an unappetizing sloppy mess that I couldn't even eat.   I am hoping this was just a fluke from maybe someone new in the kitchen and not a sign of things to come at Wolfey's"}
{"text":"Good place to eat, as not much fancy restaurant in this town. I would say this place is one of the Top 10 place for dining. Great services and decent and food, lots of variety too :)"}
{"text":"Second time here and it's just ok. This time we had wings. They were ok.  The spaghetti lasagna was very dry with not much sauce to help it. The service was very good."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it will become a regular stop. We went for lunch and arrived just before noon, no wait and smiles all around. Within 20 minutes it was packed and the staff was still smiling and no one looked the least bit stressed. Our waitress kept our plastic cups full and everything we ordered looked good. The quality of the burger and twice baked Potatoes we a little above average but didn't knock my socks off. I ordered a gyro to go and my friend loved it. The bathroom and spotless as most the restaurant. The worst thing is finding a parking spot because they are in a busy shopping center next to a state liquor store."}
{"text":"This bar and grill is great. The food great. The sport atmosphere..the best. If our team is on they have the game. You have gotta go. More of a selection of beer needed!"}
{"text":"Very nice casual bar with a very local field. They have a nice selection of beers including Great Lakes brewing Company on tap. Also good value I had an appetizer a shot of Petrone and two very large beers for $20 before the tip. Sizable outdoor seating area with a full bar and smoking allowed everywhere.they have several TVs including in the outdoor area so great place for the game. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Service can be really good or really bad at times.  The food is better than chain restaurants like Applebee's but is not a great value.  The appetizers are really good and offer different alternatives like the mozzarella bruschetta and the pretzel sticks.  If you go, try the flatbreads and burgers.  Stay away from the wraps, they are pretty bland.  Sundays they have happy hour all day.  Also, watch your check.  i have been overcharged twice."}
{"text":"It's a \"ok\" place to go. Nothing special really. Food is your  standard fare, heavy in seasoning.  The spicy Chicken soup is good. When they first opened about 10 years ago the food quality was ok. More of it was handmade in the kitchen. Now it seems that they just serve the same frozen stuff everyone else does."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch or dinner. The bread bowls with the soup are delicious. Huge menu with lots of choices though I wasn't a huge fan of the seafood pasta, everything else has been pretty good that I've tried so far. Great place to go watch a game on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and house sangria. Parking is crowded so get there before rush hour. Otherwise great atmosphere, Ohio team spirit rocking the Cleveland gear, nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This place is not even worth mentioning. Lousy, overpriced food. Loud, drunken atmosphere. Rude staff and no selection of drinks other then your average redneck fare. Please don't go. So not worth the inconvenience of paying that much money just for IBS and flaming emissions in an hour afterwards."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Good quality a little noisy and hard to find parking.  The food is good and consistent.  Bathrooms average  service inconsistent.    Bar is fun. Plenty of tvs"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Hard to believe, but we haven't come across anything that wasn't delicious. Great atmosphere,  the service is very prompt and friendly. Only downside is that if you are in a hurry for lunch, get there early, otherwise you'll probably have to wait to be seated.  That is only due to the crowds who come, not any reflection on staff. Once you are seated, though, you will be taken care of very quickly. Try the pretzel bread!"}
{"text":"I've been to Wolfey's a few times now. Each time I have been more than satisfied.   You are greeted by friendly hostesses and a short wait, if any. I've visited on date night and with a larger group. The service is wonderful and the food is delicious.   The menu is fairly large and has something for everyone. There is a good size dining area and a patio with a bar in the back. They have a variety of happy hour deals and daily specials too.  My personal favorites include the fried mozzarella, BBQ burger and OMG the garlic parmesan fries! The fries are crispy and smothered in a garlic butter sauce with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. They are hands down the best fries I've ever eaten. Did I mention I love their garlic parmesan fries?    The atmosphere is happy and upbeat. If you haven't been there, you're missing out. It quickly became my favorite local restaurant!"}
{"text":"One if the only good places in Elyria that isn't a chain. Good food, prices and atmosphere. Good hours. They have a lot of choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on a Friday about 1.   Unassuming from the outside.  Inside is a casual dining/bar with tall ceilings, good outside light streaming in.   Very clean dining area. Bathrooms clean. Hostess nice.  We were sat quick despite it being busy. Ice tea is good. All food came out in timely manor.  Twice baked potato appetizer is very yummy. Pepperoni pizza thin crust is very good. Buffalo chicken salad w/blue cheese dressing is huge and very good.  Pepperoni/sausage Stromboli is the best I ever had!  I wish this was closer where I live(an hour away), I'd eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here!  It is a jewel in a really average town!  I have lived in that town most of my life and can tell you there is no better restaurant /Bar I would want to spend the evening in.  They always have great entertainment on weekends!  You won't be sorry to eat here."}
{"text":"If only wolfey's were as good as it thinks it is. It's too loud in there.  The food is just ok. There's nowhere to park.  Finally, it's a pizza!  What the hell is a flatbread anyway?  Jesus."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time! They have a great menu. Love their wraps. They also have great specials. I stopped going there when I found out the owners are Republicans, otherwise this would be on our regular restaurant list."}
{"text":"Good spot...service was very fast. Had the Buffalo chicken wrap. Pretty basic but was good and would go back again..."}
{"text":"I would give this five stars but the prices for Elyria are bordering on the high side. However the food has never been below good and sometimes excellent. Particularly was impressed with the salads.They know how to make a real (not a boring iceberg) salad. As for atmosphere I would call it airy bar type atmosphere, definitely not intimate."}
{"text":"Waiter friendly and helpful restaurants clean and I recommend people to come"}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this place.  They had a large selection of craft draft and bottled beers along with an extensive food menu.  The pretzel sticks were very large and came with your choice of cheese. We chose the nacho cheese, and it complimented the pretzels well.  All of our food items came out piping hot and quite tasty. The next time I travel to Elyria I'll be stopping here again. Don't let the shopping plaza area turn you away."}
{"text":"Great place,that's kinda hidden. I'm not one for Elyria,but this is a must stop! Excellent food and a great beer selection"}
{"text":"Wolfey's was exactly what Elyria needed when it opened, and as a result has been consistently busy since then.  They did an excellent job converting the old Gerbers into a modern bar/restaurant setting and continue to improve with their recent addition of an outdoor patio with full bar in the back.  Most impressive here, however, is the food.  I've probably tried more than half of the menu items as well as a number of specials and the food has always been excellent.  Their chef is a man of ability and you will find many things outside of the typical \"bar fare\" to sample here.  The staff is friendly and attentive and drink prices are quite reasonable, especially during happy hour.  Give this place a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've only ever visited here on the weekend. The price of food and drinks are average for what I would expect. I normally end up spending between 20 and 30 dollars for a night here. It seems to be a hot spot on weekends.   I've never been thoroughly impressed with my experience here. Judging by the amount of people though, it must be a favorite for many. The parking lot is often packed on weekends and you'll typically find a wait. Because of that, I've had to park far across the lot and I've even been accosted by people standing outside of the neighboring liquor store...not really ideal, but it's at no fault of Wolfey's.   As for the service, I've always been treated with respect and I remember Dan standing out as being a great waiter. Wolfey's has always made an effort to accommodate our group when hosting a birthday party or other event and I greatly appreciate it. Looking forward to coming back and trying some different offerings."}
{"text":"Had my experience ruined by the hostess, a blonde girl named \"Lexi\" who seemed determined to be in the spotlight of a dramatic scene she was creating with our server. Very disappointed in the actions of the assistant manager on duty, who, while apologizing for the inconvenience, didn't offer to allow us to cancel our meals and leave (which we would have preferred). It made for an awkward night and a rather large disappointment.   The serving staff was top-notch. I really appreciated the attentiveness of Dan and Chris. I hope management is smart enough to take care of these guys and keep them around. Food was good and recommendations from the serving staff were spot on. I had the dortmunder burger and would consider getting it again. Drink selection was good, although draft choices could be expanded. Prices were reflective of a more professional establishment. Get rid of the children playing hostess (i.e. blonde/blue haired Lexi) and we would be much more impressed."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here- I had the Texas Melt and my husband had a chicken pita wrap he stated that his was excellent and would definitely order it again.  I would recommend the Texas melt first of all I asked for no tomatoes they were diced tomatoes in my box that looks like they've been scraped off of the sandwich after it was placed in there since there was also my sautéed onions in the box that must have been scraped off in the process. Also, it was soggy bread (Texas Toast). I probably wouldn't return for a burger fix but maybe something else."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout but god help you if it's busy and you're at the mercy of the hostesses. They can't help being brain dead but rudeness is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Don't let the sign fool you: it's (mostly) a bar, just with an extended bar food menu.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, though.  In a lot of ways, it's a step up from the typical setup, but doesn't really differentiate itself much. The beer selection, bottle and draft, is very good, with a distinct focus on locality. The room is large and decorated with typical fare (beer signs, etc) with a few flourishes. Our service was quick and quality, if a little brusque. I imagine the setup would be great for watching a game.   Wolfey's seems to pride itself on its food menu, and while the fare is decent, it's not interesting nor particularly good. Bottom line: great place to grab a brew and watch a game, but not the best for brunch."}
{"text":"In town for a few days,  and hit a home run at Wolfey's! Ordered the chicken cordon bleu wrap and a patty melt.  Both were fantastic! Caila served us and we couldn't have asked for better service.  May not be back for two years but we'll definitely visit Wolfey's again"}
{"text":"1 star deduction only due to the non mobile friendly online menu and the parking situation. Can't read the menu on a mobile device and hard to find a spot during the dinner rush. Food and prices were great. Had the Fried banana peppers as an appetizer and the Morning Glory Burger as my entree. They were both delicious."}
{"text":"Overrated. Food is average. Seats are hard and uncomfortable. Ambiance is loud. Crapshoot on cleanliness. If you like beer and you become a regular, then I suppose the place holds a certain appeal."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Long Island ice tea was solid, husband loved the beer selection. I got the lobster mac and it was SOOOOOO GOOD! Even better reheated the second day too- it was a HUGE portion! Husband got pizza and said it too was good. We also got a side of wings and they were good, nice and crispy with a good sauce on the wings, we got buffalo."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place until they baked a fly into my food!! I was extremely ill and vomiting. I just can't see myself going back"}
{"text":"Best bar food around, great drinks, wonderful bartenders, great happy hour specials...you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I went off the board and got the Greek salad for lunch and it did not disappoint.  I work close to here and I frequent Wolfeys frequently and have never had a bad meal and their service is outstanding.  A hidden gem"}
{"text":"Recently went there for first time was blown away by selection and the  atmosphere and cost for my order of 6 drinks all mix drinks except one beer including 2 margaritas all for 24 dollars to my surprise. I order the lobster melt which was incredibly delicious, I feel it will hurt me in the future because that's the only thing i probably ever ordered very envious we do not have anything like this in Westlake"}
{"text":"Love this place! Whenever I am in town I beg to come here. It's an amazing place to throw back a few beers and grab good grub. Their food is delicious; from burgers to even mussels! I have never had a bad experience here, including food and service. The atmosphere is fun, the place is clean and welcoming, and the food is yumm!  If you live in Elyria and haven't tried this place you certainly should, it's a great local joint!"}
{"text":"Disaster from start to finish!  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The food is priced well. I like to go in for the lunch specials. The problems I've had are parking and the host/ waiting staff. Some were lovely while others were rude."}
{"text":"3/20/2013 Lunch  I walked in about 10 minutes to 12:00 PM and there were only 2 tables being taken care of.   I sat at the bar to get some lunch and was greeted promptly.  Service was great here.  Bartender took the order and a food runner brought my food.  The reviews here brought me here to try the place.  I was not disappointed.  I ordered 6 hot wings.  Only complaint is how small they were.  I don't feel like I got what I paid for.  Sauce was good.  But the size of their wings were just not good.  I also ordered a small pepperoni flatbread since it was on special that day.  Second complaint.  I wasn't served a flatbread pizza.  I was served an actual small to medium size pizza.  Don't misunderstand this.  I got way more food than I could eat at this point because I thought I was ordering a flatbread.  It was a good surprise.  I just wasn't expecting to get a full pizza.  And boy was it good!  I would go back here for the pizza any time.  It was that good.  When I left almost an hour later there wasn't a table open in the place.  It was jammed.  Looks like the locals know a good bar food place, too.  Overall I consider this place to have some of the best bar food I've ever had."}
{"text":"A few friends and I were visiting and found this place on Yelp. It's kinda tucked away inside a shopping center but great atmosphere once inside. Server was friendly and attentive. I had the Citrus Chicken Chipotle Bowl and my friends had the baked macaroni and cheese. Portions were large and we all really enjoyed our food. The mac n cheese was definitely the highlight though! One of the best I've tasted from a restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizza, and more! Their salads and strombolis are really fantastic! Fast, friendly service and great atmosphere. Plenty of beers to choose from and great happy hour specials. It's a favorite lunch hangout for my coworkers...the food comes out quickly and prices are extremely reasonable.  Their patio in the back is great and there's a a bar right there with plenty of TVs.   Wolfey's is located in a shopping center that has two other restaurants, so finding a spot during busy hours can be tough, but that's the only negative in my opinion! Hit up Wolfey's for some divine food and drank! Cheers, mate! :-P"}
