{"text":"AMAZING! Delicious pork dumplings and love the hot chick! Chicken wing special on Thursday is very good and nice variety of flavors. The spicy green beans are addicting, YUM!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the spicy garlic beans and ginger chicken with mushroom congee. My boyfriend got the baked rice with the Portuguese style curry. The more traditional dishes were flavored very well, and tasted very authentic. The baked rice was more fun, and the flavor combinations really worked!"}
{"text":"Fitchburg didn't have some of the awesome non-chain restaurant selections that you get in Monroe or Willy Street - until now! The menu doesn't have a billion options, but every item I've tried so far is delicious and everything is far more hip and upscale than you might expect from the general location or the prices. This beats out Curry in a Box and generic American Chinese food any day. In my world, it gives Sujeo a run for it's money (for a lot less of yours)!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I go here for lunch about once a week.   I love how their are always new things to try.  The owner is a true foodie."}
{"text":"This place is good if you want a quick no fuss meal. We went in on Thursday, as we were eager to try their wings, and Thursday is the day they have their \"wings\" special. To our disappointment, we were told they \"weren't making them today,\" so we had to go with plan B. We ordered the beef and chicken dumplings to start. The beef were definitely the better of the two, as the chicken was lacking in flavor. The accompanying sauce, however, was a tasty addition. For our entrees we ordered the chicken rice plate and the Korean beef rice plate. Both were good, and like the dumplings, the beef won out for it's superior seasoning and flavors. Overall, the food was good, but nothing wowed us. Like a few other reviewers mentioned, some of the tables were dirty. Also, the food is served on cafeteria-like plates with plastic utensils, which also takes away from the ambience. Overall, good if you want a quick bite and nothing more."}
{"text":"The food was okay, just average flavors for a place so pricey. If you're a decent cook, don't order here and make it yourself. Highly dissapointed"}
{"text":"Spicy garlic green beans are fantastic! Also enjoyed the curry tofu. BBQ pork melts in your mouth. Fun atmosphere,  good beer, huge portions!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for their lunch specials and we absolutely loved it! The panfried pork dumplings were delicious. Each of their unique dipping sauces were so very tasty. I tried the barbecue pork rice plate. The rice was on point and the pork was juicy and flavorful. If you're looking for a good meal in Fitchburg, you cannot go wrong with SoHo."}
{"text":"SOHO started off as a successful food cart venue and transitioned to a full-pledged restaurant. The place is small, but cozy, and the atmosphere exudes good vibes. There is no server, so you have to order your food through the front counter; and right behind the counter is an open kitchen - ala food cart style, but in a bigger scale. The kitchen staff brings your order when it's ready. 

The food in general is good. I love the Shanghai Braised Pork Belly and especially the Dessert Sweet Bun served with a condense milk - it brought memories of my childhood (my mom used to make this). However, I made the mistake of ordering the Korean Style Beef, thinking it's the same as the Korean Beef Bulgogi - but it's not. It's just a bland strip flank of beef.

The staff is very friendly and it did not take long for our food to come (although the pork belly took a while, but it was worth the wait). I would definitely come back, especially for the fried bread."}
{"text":"So excited to have good, fresh Asian food in Fitchburg. Tried it for the first time today and have a feeling I will be a regular. I could have eaten the chutney served with the Hong Kong pork with a spoon. I'm usually suspicious of non-traditional dumplings, but I was easily won over by the So Hot Chick dumplings and their ranch sauce. Can't wait to finish trying the menu!"}
{"text":"Had most of their menu by now,  and hard to decide which is my favorite, as it's all excellent.   The calamari is the best I've had in Madison, and the pork belly and Hong Kong pork are delicious.  

Great example of a restaurant focusing on a few dishes and doing them right."}
{"text":"SoHo is a great Asian Fusion Restaurant! SoHo Restaurant has a great atmosphere and modern  look! The service is quick and friendly! The food is great the Beef Dumplings are really good and they come with fantastic sauces and so are the Chicken dumplings! They also have a really good Korean style beef with Rice! They also have a curry chicken with rice also very good ! 
I really enjoyed eating at SoHo! Hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"The spicey green beans are so good, I would return to this restaurant in a heartbeat in order to eat them again. 

Having said that, I was disappointed overall by our visit. This was my first time eating at the restaurant and at first glance it was noticeable that the dining area is not very clean. In addition, there are stickers on each table with what I assume to be the restaurant logo but they are coming off of the tables and need to be removed. This restaurant needs a deep clean. 

We were dining at the restaurant at 5 pm and when I ordered the spring rolls I was informed they were sold out. It always flummoxes me when a restaurant says they are sold out of an item at 5pm on a Saturday and only two tables are taken in the dining area. 

Also, the expectation of tipping is way too high for a 'bus your own table' type of restaurant. When paying for your food order, a screen is held up by the employee behind the counter asking you to select a pre set tipping amount of 15%, 20% etc. This puts the customer in an awkward position because they have just ordered their food and have no idea what type of service they will be receiving yet. Even so, the only service provided is the employee bringing the dishes to your table. The rest is done by the customer. In addition, they have a tip jar placed at the reception table. Just seems way too pushy for getting tips. I could understand if they only had a tip jar but I think asking all customers to chose an additional tip when paying just comes across as greedy. Other restaurants that have a similar bus your own table concept do not ask for tipping upon initial payment (i.e Qdoba, Noodles). 

The Kalamari was just ok, it lacked flavor. The beef dumplings were ok as well, I did enjoy the soy dipping sauce. The macaroni and cheese dumplings were average. The overall flavors were really just meh, aside from the delicious green beans."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the curry garlic fried rice and my husband had pork belly. Both were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Do they have a membership? Because I'm here more than I am at my gym.

I've tried almost every item on the menu and everything is soooooo good!

What brought me to the brick and mortar version of the food truck was initially the dumplings. Hand formed and hand packed, the peel is nice and thick to support the hearty fillings.

The calamari and green beans are my go to from the appetizer section, although the brussels sprouts come in closely at second/third place.

The baked fried rice is something new and borrows flavors from Portuguese with a light coconut curry sauce. Or choose the Hong Kong Style with tomato sauce. Both are topped with mozzarella and comes with a choice of proteins and baked to perfection. It's honestly a food baby because it's hefty, without leaving you feeling heavy afterwards.

My partner really loves the Korean Beef. You get that smokey, Korean BBQ grill char and deep flavor. They don't skimp on the meat either.

I've tired the Pepper Steak, Pork Cutlet (tonkasu), Pork Belly, but my favorite rice plate dish is the Cantonese Stir Fry, add beef. Get it extra spicy, you won't regret it. I love that it has a ton of veggies (Eggplant, potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers) in addition to meaty, tender slices of beef.

Oh and how can you not love Rocky? He's always around and perpetually smiling. You can tell he really puts a lot of care and passion into the food and how it's presented to his customers. I wish him and his endeavor well.

They do catering and on-site setup drop offs. They'll even bring a food cart to your special event.

Pro Tip: they'll send you coupons via square pay so make sure you check your inbox!"}
{"text":"Had the Hong Kong curry and dumplings.  The dumplings were good, but the curry was just lame.  It was more like gravy than a curry.  

Place was clean and open and friendly.  Food came quickly.

Wouldn't recommend as Madison has many better Asian places."}
{"text":"Decided to order delivery from SoHo using the Yelp App. I called the restaurant to see if they delivered outside of Fitchburg and they made it happen. Ordered my food about 7:45pm and they close at 8:30pm - I was highly impressed that they still sent my order out considered the time it takes to make the food and deliver. The driver was super friendly and my food was still hot when I received it.

Ordered the Mac N' Cheese dumplings since they seemed to be a hit and the Spicy Chicken dumplings. Also, ordered a chicken dish and Taiwanese popcorn chicken. Everything including the sauces had so much flavor. It was like a flavor fest in my mouth! My family loved the food and we even had left overs the next day. Highly recommend to try this gem of a place. Excellent customer service! Fabulous food!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the Madison area. Their food is consistently fresh and delicious. I could come here for their dumplings alone, and while I would be satisfied I would be missing out on everything else SoHo has to offer. The pork belly and Korean beef are particular winners. There are also different specials every day, they do fried rice, burger, chicken wing, and lo mein specials every week. I had their salt and pepper chicken wings one Wednesday and they blew my mind. I'm so happy that the SoHo cart is omnipresent at most Madison festivals, but it is more than worth the trip to Fitchburg."}
{"text":"I tried this place recently after hearing about them around town. My partner goes here periodically for its location and it being Asian fusion. I didn't have extremely high expectations but expected legitimacy. The place was packed on a weekday lunch, service not as fast as similar counter service restaurants in town. Ordered pork dumplings, charbroiled chicken, and bbq beef. The pork dumplings were disappointing, soggy; my partner explained this has occurred on other occasions as well. The bbq beef was too sweet my liking, tasting an awful lot like hoisin out of the bottle. The chicken was the clear winner given in large portion with nice char. All proteins were cooked well and tender. Both entrees came with rice, cucumber, and a chutney. The garlic ginger fried rice with a large egg on top does look delicious. I would try this is someone wanted me to go back."}
{"text":"I REALLY like the app popcorn fried chicken. SO GOOD! I'd venture to say this is the best fried chicken in Madison. Plus it comes with a little soy sauce! YUM. 5/5

Their chicken and rice reminds me of my friend Lee's Guamanian family get-togethers: can you scream chicken kelaguen (chicken ceviche)!?!?!? I am crying tears of joy! Don't freak out - it's not raw chicken. It's small cuts of chargrilled chicken with a cucumber, lemoney- soy dipping sauce and rice on the side. If you've never had chicken kelaguen (Chamoro food), come here for a taste, minus the large family and Hawaiian style music. I love it when food offers a memory - THANKS SoHo! Small portion 4/5

Pork dumplings are good. 4/5

Curry is not bad. It's a fusion: not real curry. This is a noodle dish with a curry flavored soup broth (read: watery). I needed noodles the night I got it, and the curry was just a side note. 3/5"}
{"text":"I usually really like the dumplings and chicken/rice dishes from the cart. I ordered from the restaurant for the first time tonight. Everything went well, I picked up the food, I got home, I opened the container for the Sassy Peanut salad and thought, \"Wow. Really, Soho? Really?\" It was iceberg lettuce with about 1/2 an apple cut up, a scant amount of peanuts, and crunchy noodles. It's not like that combo isn't okay, but for $7 I expect better. 

I'll be sticking to the food cart and dumplings from now on."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. A great and interesting  alternative to standard Asian take-out. But the portions are too small for the price. 

Free tip to owners: Completely gut and re-do the interior. I realize that this isn't chiefly a sit-down restaurant, but this has to be one of the most unpleasant rooms ever. Bright, flourescent light will burn your eyes off.  Food place owners need to understand how off-putting bad lighting and cheap decor actually are."}
{"text":"I fell in love with SoHo after a yelp event there previously this year, so when I had a chance to take my mom and partner here, I took it! It was a weeknight, and late for dinner, so we were the only patrons in the restaurant. We were given good recommendations while ordering, and the food came out quickly. There was a mix-up with my dumpling order, but they were quick to fix it and didn't charge for the mix-up. I enjoyed the favorites that I have had before, and the new items that I tried. Looking forward to warm weather again so I can enjoy the food cart outdoors at festivals!"}
{"text":"O.M.G. Yum. Found this spot as I was running errands in the area and I couldn't be more pleased with this random find. It's a smaller restaurant but so bright and open. The cashier seemed to be new and still learning the register, but she was very friendly. 
I had the Hong Kong curry with Tofu, while my boyfriend had the Cantonese style stir fry with Tofu, both were delicious but his won in the flavor department. Everything is made fresh to order and arrives at your table still piping hot. AND you get a complimentary beer with your check in!!
If in the area you have to try them out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great little place that offers a small but stable menu. Each day there is a special that is limited in supply so get there early. The pricing is fair and the flavor is great. 

The dumplings are great but some might find them a little fatty as they are finished off in a frying pan as opposed to being steamed as some may prefer."}
{"text":"Went to Soho for lunch and the food was great. Fun to have a new option and can't wait to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Always great! Great owner, great food, lots of varieties / specials - follow them on facebook for a lot of unique and tasty specials."}
{"text":"We came to Soho while we were passing through Madison on our epic road trip in my Tesla (http://teslaroadtrips.blogspot.com). A friend of mine had suggested that we take the hour detour off the main route to stop over at Rocky's expansion, which, I understand from him is just a few weeks old. Having never tried any of his gourmet dumplings I wasn't sure what to expect, especially since I had eaten many dumplings over the last year at various places in Toronto, San Francisco, and Hong Kong. 

Rocky's (Soho) dumplings were a lovely spin on the classic that I've grown to love and they delivered. Each of the pairs of flavours melted in my mouth and I was thrilled to have finally eaten some of the best food on my trip. My traveling companion was equally impressed. And then Rocky had his team bring out a plate of dessert that blew my mind. I won't spoil it for you here but you should make the trip over and see, no, taste, for yourself!"}
{"text":"A tiny menu but there are a few dishes on it that keep me coming back: SoHo charbroiled chicken, Ginger Chicken and Mushroom soup and dessert sweet buns... too few menu choices to come back often, but they are moderately/good tasty dishes -- more like a 3-star NY eatery. :)"}
{"text":"SoHo Gourmet was reviewed in our local weekly free newspaper the Isthmus, so I scooted over there today. I've had some nasty stomach virus for 4 days, and was hunting for a meal that would (1) not aggrevate my tummy (2) be delicious and (3) be healthy. How lovely to find that the reviews of SoHo Gourmet were spot on. Thankfully they had a lunch special of their chicken congee (AKA Asian chicken soup) today, which is helping me feel more like a human being again. Yummy yum yum. I got takeout, and had the opportunity to chat with their delightful staff (owners?). The personal touch is there, as is the attention to quality and details. Regardless of what some of the commenters posted about the interiors, I found it and their logos to be creative and fun. Think about it people, these entrepreneurs started with the food cart approach, and then had enough success to move to brick and mortar.  Color me impressed. You guys rock!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to write this review until I've tried everything on the menu (Relax, they have a small menu). I did not try all the salads...but I think one salad is enough to go by.

First of all, I really really wanted to like this place and give it a 5 star, however, there were a few things that knocked it down. Let's start with some of the awesome things about this place first:

1. The food is pretty darn good. Try the charbroiled chicken with the ginger chutney. Really, anything on the entree side is awesome. I loved the curry as well.
2. The dumplings are very good. The pork dumplings are pretty standard. The key is to get the buffalo chicken dumplings. This is a great fusion of American and Asian cuisine.
3. Get the apple pie dumpling for dessert. You'll thank me later. Just do it. It's amazing.

On top of the great food, the customer service has been great. I observed an interaction where they forgot to give a customer something in their food and the customer came back. The restaurant offered a free soda, which they did not have to do, and the customer was pleasantly surprised and happy with it.

Now, I did have a few complaints. I tried one of their salads and it looked like it had been made a few days back. Normally this isn't a huge deal but the lettuce was turning brown. Not very appetizing. However, the portion size of the salad was plenty and could almost be a meal for most people.

Also, when I tried the pork belly, it was charred beyond recognition. The sauce and flavor was good but the pork belly was disappointing because it was all burnt.

Overall, I really like this place and it's a great addition to the Fitchburg area. It has a lot of potential and I will be a frequent visitor. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Update 12/15/16

Too bad yelp only keeps one review. Today I had their vietnamese wings and I'm in haven. Wings done right - crispy around the edges, tender in the middle and flavorful sauce that coats the wings without drenching them. Must try these when they are available. 

I had it with the chicken and mushroom congee on a sub zero day and the combination warms my inside. 

Check their facebook page for Friday specials. Tomorrow will be lamb chops. 

Previous review ----- still valid. 

The Soho charbroiled chicken is wonderful! Flavorful and still moist. Char roiling done right. 

Good price for lunch since there's plenty to eat. Had the pork dumpling with vinegar sauce that is also good. 

Try their long beans as well. 

The green onions and ginger sauce for the chicken is also tasty but presentation can be better. Spacious place with plenty of parking available outside. 

I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the dumplings-- i ordered 6, and they were very filling. I liked the fast casual atmosphere of the restaurant even if the location was a bit out of the way for me.  I definitely will find my way back!"}
{"text":"Wow. My husband took me to Soho last night for the first time and my mind was blown!! Everything was delicious! We shared the brussel sprouts, pork dumplings, beef dumplings, lo mein (spicy) and the chicken and rice entree. Definitely had more than enough for lunch today and all the ingredients tasted so fresh and perfectly seasoned and cooked. We will be back. Often!"}
{"text":"The curry was amazing. Everything about it was great from the textures to the tastes. I might add the staff was friendly and the food was made quickly. I would highly recommend Soho."}
{"text":"Dumpling was great, we had two different flavors, the pork was better than the chicken, but both were very tasty.  The kimchee was great, chicken was good, not amazing, but I am not complaining.  Service was awesome, the guy there was fantastic"}
{"text":"The reviews don't match our experience. The food was AWFUL! The Mac and cheese dumplings had NO CHEESE in them. Helllllooooo it's WISCONSIN!!!

The curry had a weird aftertaste and the chicken had a dark gamey taste to it. Mystery meat."}
{"text":"Great fresh healthy food at a great price!  I live about 1/2 mile from this great find in Fitchburg.  It's family owned and operated and offers a great fresh menu...  lunch specials daily.  Even though we live close we often have them deliver and it always arrives promptly, hot, and fresh.  Our favorites are the teriyaki lunch special served with salad, rice, potstickers, and a variety of housmade sauces and accoutrements like pickled sliced cucumber.  We also LOVE the pork belly!  Really can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"Everything that I have tried here has been excellent.  I've come here after work at least 10 times, and the owner Rocky is very helpful with my orders.  It's the first place I've gone to for take out where they would ask when I would arrive so that the food would be at an optimal readiness for my enjoyment - very important for fried tofu or some of their dumplings.

The scallion chutney reminds me of home.  The roast pork is very good, though the sauce they pour on top could be just on the salty side.  Charboiled chicken is pretty solid.  Dumplings are good.  Green beans are excellent."}
{"text":"This place to me was \"just OK\". Not bad, not great. The prices were very fair and would probably be a reason to go back - for a cheaper dinner option that is still satisfactory.

The highlight of the meal to me was the Mac N Cheese dumplings. It had a unique flavor and something I have not had before. The entree - the Hong Kong Curry - wasn't incredible to me. It tasted like something I could make at home with a rice cooker(the rice had a taste that reminded me of a rice cooker I've used) and some golden curry cubes. The tofu in that dish was the highlight of the meal to me."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. When I first visited nearly a year ago, I found the owner to be very friendly, and that made it difficult for me to come here and bring their rating down on account of the inconsistent service and cooking done by the other employees.

I went back recently to find that they've gone from the traditional way of frying dumplings to deep-frying them. It's not nearly as tasty this way. Really, I find that there's too much grease in the food here in general.

That said, the congee is very good when it's available. I used to like the more adventurous flavors of dumplings before they deep fried them. The traditional flavors are meh. The plates generally taste pretty good. Calamari is good, sticky buns are too greasy.

The ambience is nice and the food can be good, but my experiences here have been too inconsistent for me to feel like this is any better than a 3 star place."}
{"text":"We drove here from Madison since the place had some interesting reviews. There isn't much to write about, this is fairly standard asian food. Cooked decently but nothing amazing. The string beans were probably the best part. I can see people liking the place since it's cheap.
For the food, I'm at 3.5 stars, but the owners are really nice and know how to deal with customers very well so I'll bump to a 4."}
{"text":"Great little place that offers small, but well constructed menu. They keep it fresh by updating the options often. Have to try the Mac n cheese wontons as a rite of passage."}
{"text":"Favorite day is Monday...Fried Rice Day!  So delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Amazeballs. Limited menu means they know what they're doing. This sounds crazy but their vegetable sides (green beans or brussel sprouts) are the best ever. I wish I knew how they prepared them. I'd eat them every day. I'm also a fan of turkey congee which is a perfect winter soup. Thick and delicious with fresh green onion. The dumplings are pretty dope. I like the classic the best. The alternative ones just lack in texture. Be aware they sometimes run out of things."}
{"text":"I had the pork dumplings, Vietnamese brussel sprouts and a local beer. The food tasted wonderful, however the smell of the cooked brussel sprouts is enough to make you want to vomit. Can't really blame it on the cook...it is what it is."}
{"text":"I  was so excited to try this place but, sadly, left disappointed. The staff were friendly and prompt. The space wasn't the cleanest-many tables had been bused but not wiped off leaving bits of rice here and there. The meals are an excellent value-you get a ton of food for the price. Sadly it wasn't enough to make up for the overall flavors. My bf had the Hong Kong bbq pork and he was bummed about how fatty the cuts of meat were. The pork was cooked well but the amount of fat in the dish made it a bit unappetizing. I had the pork belly which was cooked wonderfully. The flash fry they add at the end really crisps things up nicely. Unfortunately I found both dishes overly salty-I'm pretty sure it was the sauces. 

The cucumbers accompanying both dishes were awesome. Another highlight was the ginger scallion sauce served with the bbq pork. It really made me want to try their dumplings as it reminded me of excellent pork dumplings I've had elsewhere. Despite an unimpressive showing, I'll be back to try their dumplings-there is just something about this place that speaks to me and I'm not ready to give up on them yet!"}
{"text":"I give SoHo an A- for creativity but closer to a C for execution.  We ordered the calamari, beef and pork dumplings, and the Hong Kong BBQ pork and the shanghai braised pork belly. 

The positives - spicy green beans. It wasn't all that spicy but no one can dislike green beans and garlic.  
The pickles on the side.  That was a nice touch as a side to some rich pork belly. 
The ability to have two choices in types of dumplings. You can order 6 stickers and have half pork and half beef! 

Less than positives - calamari. Was rather chewy and not that flavorful. Good garlic specks at the bottom of the dish, but the calamari itself isn't worth ordering. 
The pork - the BBQ pork wasn't on point for flavor and was more tart than I'd expect. The pork belly was pretty good, but it was a little chewy...

I'd go back for a quick lunch that's filling and for the green beans. But not for much else!"}
{"text":"This place was good! A bit on the pricey side but I had the spicy garlic green beans, brussel sprouts, popcorn chicken, dumplings and the steak. Everything was great except I wasn't in love with the potstickers... I'm not an expert but they just seemed a little bland hence the 4 everything else was on point"}
{"text":"I am SO excited to find SoHo Gourmet Cuisines. This place is the real deal. Clean, friendly, personable - and most importantly - INCREDIBLE flavors: fused and authentic. I had a rice plate pork dumpling combo, and I can't wait to go back for more. Prices are fair. This spot is 2 minutes from my work (which I just started), and I will be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in several times and the food is always great and interesting.  I am a big fan of the charred chicken rice plate.  It is the sauces that make the dishes unique!"}
{"text":"Ok, so after moving out to Fitchburg, I feel like I'm always defending our little suburb to those who feel as though there is nothing good out here (obviously uninformed, Fitchburg supremecy!) Score one for the good guys, because we just got the storefront version of Soho! Very tasty stuff, similar menu to the food cart, which is a good thing. Definitely an improvement over Cousin's to say the least! Love the dumplings, but it sounds like I'll have to try one of their other offerings next time. Yay Soho!"}
{"text":"I don't know how so many people love this place. We've been there 3 times so far and every time there was something wrong with their vent and the whole place was stuffed with smoke. I could hardly breathe and needed to go out for air in the middle of dinner. 

The food is alright. Nothing amazing. Lots of deep fried things. The Little popcorn chicken dish (Hong Kong chicken? Or Taiwanese chicken?) is just hard little knots of something that vaguely tastes like chicken. The fried Brussels sprouts are so greasy I had to dab them with a napkin before eating. 

The owner is super nice and very friendly. But With all the restaurants around I don't think we'll be going back here."}
{"text":"Great unique Asian food. The charbroiled chicken with the chutney is awesome. The pork potstickers are my favorite, but the Mac and cheese are fun for a change of pace. Always super friendly service."}
{"text":"First, my disclaimer ... Sunday afternoon may not be the best day and time to try a new place. While there was only 1 other person there eating it still took quite awhile to get our food. It came out to the table over several trips, and not because it was so much, but I suspect the timing inn the kitchen was ofg.

Of the various items we ordered off the menu, the calamari was by far the best. However it didn't arrive until we were more than half way finished eating our dumplings, soup, and Korean beef. The beef was a bit dry but had nice flavor. The rice was overcooked and bland, and the soup most likely wasn't fresh given the consistency and taste.

I am willing however to give it another try. I may just try something different off the menu."}
{"text":"Very, very good!  Clear clean flavors.  Pork plate ordered through GrubHub.  Love the lightly pickled cucumbers and the garlic chutney-good add for the dish.  Wow!
Dumplings and dessert for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty.  Order in advance because wait time is very long if you order to go in house.  A little pricey for the amount of food that you get.  Menu is smaller than most asian restaurants which makes a decision easier.  In my opinion, the best item on the menu is the Vietnamese style green beans.  The green beans goes well with white rice."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, SoHo is one of the true unique dining options in the Madison area.   Food quality, taste, and presentation are consistently amazing.   They have a diverse set menu with items like traditional dumplings and Vietnamese style Brussel Sprouts (which I definitely recommend).  I've sampled almost everything and have never been disappointed.  The black pepper steak is unbeatable.  But, outside their set menu, they're also constantly creating new dishes and dining experiences that are just as awesome.   Most recently, I had the pleasure of trying the pineapple shrimp fried rice served inside half a pineapple!   It was fresh, flavorful, and perfectly prepared.  Portions are very generous and service is always friendly.  It's truly one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Man, the rice plates here are GOOD! For $8-11, you get bowl's worth of rice with juicy, flavorful meat and sweet cucumber pickles. So far, I have tried the bbq pork and the braised pork belly, and both were delicious. I can't really describe these items better than the menu does, but I'll try:

The bbq pork is really tender with a gravy-like brown sauce that is sweet, salty, and savory without being overpowering by any means. The secret weapon is the ginger scallion sauce on the side; its bright, herbal flavor really shines through the pork's dark, savory flavor.

The braised pork belly provides big chunks of tender braised pork belly that has been finished in the fryer to provide a crispy exterior. This is served on top of sautéed green beans and topped with a mushroom-based sweet and sour sauce.

The dumplings were ok. I tried the pork ones, and I found them to be pretty tasty, but they were nothing special.

I will definitely be back to try some more rice plates. SoHo offers good, affordable  comfort food with a simple menu and a casual environment. They also announce their specials on Facebook, so be sure to like their page to find out about some off-menu offerings."}
{"text":"There is something very intriguing about Asian Fusion cuisines that they don't typically play by the culinary rulebook! Our first time here was a positive direction towards that.

Ambiance : Simple, casual and to the point. 

Service : We arrived smack at their dinner service starting point and were literally the first ones so service on that note was very prompt. The gentlemen at the counter was very polite and friendly and even suggested us their highly coveted Spicy Garlic Green Beans!

Food : We started off with a portion each of their Pan Fried Dumplings (Authentic Pork and Hot Chick), Shanghai Braised Pork Belly with side of Spicy Green Beans and Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken.

The pan fried dumplings had a nice thin shell on them and were fried just right. The pork was very well cooked but the star was the Hot Chick! A mildly spicy but incredibly flavorsome minced meat was one of the best dumplings I've had in a while. 

The pork belly plate was a lesson in generosity!! Unlike most places, the portion of pork belly here was very impressive! And it was oh so well cooked that that fat on it simply melted away when you ate it giving that perfect companionship to the meaty pork. Loved it!!

The popcorn chicken was yet another star as the chicken was perfectly marinated and thankfully had a minimal flour coating. The basil pairing gave it a nice earthiness finish that made the whole dish a standout!

I'd be doing a disservice if I don't mention their smash hit - Spicy Garlic Green Beans. Now I'm not known to go out and eat too many veggies but this....this I can gladly much down an entire plate!! The crispiness of the beans and that coating on them of chili garlic oil was insane :)

This one is a sure-shot revisit and I highly recommend you try them out!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and unique food. They have these steamed macaroni steamed dumplings that are the most delicious."}
{"text":"I'm digging SoHo. As a resident of the Fitch, I am always excited to see a new restaurant open. Located in the former Cousins Subs, the food cart opened this fast casual restaurant. The menu is limited and is what I would consider Asian fusion. I opted for the chicken curry. Flavor wise, it was delicious. Not as sweet as a Thai curry. I would consider it a hybrid between Thai and Indian with a decent amount of spice. The only thing holding this back is the lack of protein. Ordered with chicken, it was big on flavor but light on yardbird. While the price point is relatively low ($8.50), I sill expected more. 
I will definitely return as it a perfect place for when you don't want to cook but you also don't want to waste an hour plus at a sit down restaurant.  Welcome to the neighborhood, SoHo!"}
{"text":"I had the tofu curry and later the chicken curry. I love curry, but SoHo is not my favorite. The tofu was spongy and the flavor was nothing special. I also personally prefer my curry more soupy. I also had a beef bbq special that was not my favorite. The owner seems very nice and the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"My coworker recommended SoHo to me because of their dumplings. The first time I went to SoHo, I actually decided not to order dumplings, and ordered Hong Kong Curry (chicken) instead. It was....eh. I'm not that great of a cook, but I can make better curry than that. I felt that for its price ($9), I expected better. 

I usually give restaurants second chances so I came back, this time I tried pork and beef dumplings. I gotta say they were a disappointment. Noodles and Company, and even grocery stores, make better dumplings than Soho.

Despite that, I came back months later because seems like people like this place and I have yet to see/experience that. I ordered Shanghai Braised Pork Belly and hubby ordered Hong Kong BBQ Pork. Finally! Some good food! I usually don't like green beans, but I love their green beans! Every time we order from Soho, we order those two and they never disappoint!

We still continued to try their different dumplings, and I still stand by my original statement/opinion. I probably will never order dumplings from Soho, unless they try to improve the taste.

The customer service is always good!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, very delicious.  We liked the chicken rice dish and calamari the most."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET DELIVERY!!!! we've tried it twice... they failed the first time, but we decided to give them another chance, and they failed yet again. The first time, it took 2 HOURS... something about not getting the order, and then the delivery driver didn't get the call? Uhhh what!?!? The second time, they forgot part of our order! What the heck is wrong with them? We will never order delivery again from Soho, which sucks because there aren't a lot of options for delivery where we live in Fitchburg. So frustrating--they need to get their act together!!"}
{"text":"I came here the pick up something I won from an Instagram Contest (so awesome). 

I have always wanted to try this place, but did not know it was an actual restaurant. I always thought they were just a food cart. Hidden in the massive shopping center (same as Pick'N Save and Great Dane in Fitchburg)-- it is a hidden gem. 

While I was waiting, there were several regulars who picked up orders. I see myself as a regular. I ordered their Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken, Kimchi Fried Rice with Chicken, and got their dumplings.

Everything was so delicious. They have a good variety on their menu. I can't wait to try everything else. Apparently if you order six dumplings, you can split into two different types (3 of one and 3 of another). 

They are randomly closed between 2-4PM on some days. Not sure which, but now I know. Follow them on instagram for contests and pictures! 

I'm excited to try their cheesy baked fried rice and their green beans."}
{"text":"Ordered Yelp delivery. Food was awesome... When it arrived. Not the restaurant's fault, but the food took over an hour to get here, 3 miles away. 
I think it would have tasted even better if we went to the restuarant. 
Ordered the porkbelly. Buddy ordered the Korean beef. Both were good. Menu is diverse and so far everything is good. Definitely would order again."}
{"text":"We got the pork and chicken dumplings. They both were kept in oil for too long and it tasted like bad oil. I usually love dumplings but did not like these at all you could not taste what was inside because of the overwhelming flavor of the oil

They were quick on the order. I will try other dishes there besides the dumplings to see if they are better"}
{"text":"SoHo isn't just good cause their food is great, it's also because Rocky is so passionate about his business, always trying new food creations and open to feedback.

This is not just another one of those Asian fusion type places to me. I feel some places fuse things just for the sake of it and just try to make very ethnic foods a little less scarier for those that are more used to a western palate. At Soho the new takes on popular Asian foods are well thought out. 

Their Brussels sprouts and green beans are amazing. Anyone who is on the fence about Brussels sprouts this will change their minds! No soggy sprouts here, they a good crunch and great flavor profile.

Out of their meat selection I really enjoy the braised pork. I like all the dumplings! Except maybe the max and cheese one, but that might just be me feeling bad about eating carbs on carbs.

I've also had the baked fried rice, a Wisconsinite's dream. Fried rice covered in a blanket of cheese you can get to choose one of the two sauces and the meat. .

So one of the coolest things about SoHo is that they have specials throughout the week. I've enjoyed tacos on taco Tuesday which my friend visiting town raved about. Eggplant and minced pork on Mama So Cooking Thursdays. I loved having some good authentic chinese food not from a typcial chinese food carryout that serves mostly general tso's. I can't wait to come back to a burger special and their lo mein!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious! Rocky the owner operator is fantastic. He was extremely helpful and outgoing in assisting my wife and I with choosing our first meal here. I highly recommend SOHO and suggest ordering their dumplings as an appetizer"}
{"text":"A small menu, but a nice mix of choices. Although the food truck that inspired this restaurant is famous for its dumplings, they were my least favorite of the items here (although still good!). I loved the fabulous calamari (dry cooked, and so good they don't need sauce) and the fried tofu (crispy outside, with garlic, scallions, and soy sauce) small plates. There are also four entree choices for meats, served with rice, and three delicious-sounding salads (the only menu category I didn't try)."}
{"text":"My roommate really hyped this place up for a while but, to be honest, I was a little disappointed after coming here. The staff were all very friendly, the service was prompt, and the place was neat and tidy. But, the food wasn't really as exciting as I thought it would be and some of it wasn't worth the price. I ordered some of their dumplings and the Shanghai Braised Pork Belly as my main dish. The pork belly was alright; it was a little under-seasoned in spices in terms of what I would expect from a Shanghainese dish and the fat hadn't broken down like I expected it would after a long braise so it was more squishy than I wanted. I was a bit upset at the value of the dumplings. I understand the upcharge for some unique creations like the mac 'n' cheese dumplings but it's a little too steep to ask for more than $1 a dumpling for traditional pork dumplings. Maybe I have a personal bias towards Asian fusion food though, because I prefer regular Asian food, so take this review with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. The calamari appetizer is the best anywhere. This is great food."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and we both ordered different dishes. I had the Hong Kong style pork cutlet. It came with a ball of white rice, and a simply fried pork cutlet cut into slices sitting in a tomato sauce. It was incredibly bland. Almost no flavor at all to speak of. Rice and meat, and 3 slices of cucumber. This could use a pile of veggies and some seasoning. Something. Anything. My wife got the SoHo Charbroiled Chicken. It was a chicken breast and a ball of white rice and a few cucumber slices. It came with a weird cucumber sauce that was more olive oil than anything else, and again, bland. The chicken itself had more flavor than the sauces, and it was cooked really well, but this wasn't as tasty as making a chicken breast at home over a bed of microwaved flavored rice. We also ordered six pork dumplings with a side of a ginger vinegar sauce. Not much in these dumplings at all, the sauce tasted like straight vinegar.  We ate maybe half the meal before giving up.

The restaurant itself is very nice, clean, and the people working were polite. But the food itself is so bland. All of their dishes could use spices, vegetables, other additions to the meals. For the price, we could have made a months worth of chicken breasts with rice at home with more taste."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for lunch! Amazing Asian fusion cuisine. Authentic flavors and intriguing menu items. Get the fried tofu. And the Brussels sprouts. Friendly and informative owner. Such good food."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to SoHo yet, then you are missing out on the true hidden gem of Fitchburg, WI. With a concise menu and similarly economic staff, SoHo packs the punch of a 5-star NY eatery while maintaining the personality and charm of any mom & pop stop you'd expect on the drive towards rural Wisconsin.
Rocky, the young and enthusiastic owner, would be glad to make a menu recommendation, whether you spot him at the store location in Fitchburg or the mobile stand at one of Madison's many community activities. From handmade dumplings to BBQ chicken to Korean beef to pork belly - everything on Rocky's menu is hearty, homemade, and delightfully layered in flavor. If you're sick of the typical \"meat & rice\" bowl from your local Asian eatery, then these dishes are for you. Accompanying each entree is Rocky's own brand of sauces, in addition to garnishes of cucumber, chutney, and kimchi that make this restaurant like no other in the greater Madison area.
Take my word for it, friends - this restaurant got me into the Yelp game in the first place! Couldn't be more glad to leave a 5-star review for a restaurant and staff who give this town such vibrant personality. Whether you're stopping in for a rice bowl, a mac and cheese dumpling (yes), or just an imported beer & green beans, SoHo is a local Fitchburg eatery that will never let you down."}
{"text":"Never realized this place existed. Probably because of the small sign relative to other establishments surrounding it.

My friends were not joking when they say they have a great charbroiled chicken. Served only with white rice and sauces on the side, the meat has savory char flavor and served in even more savory green beans. They are delicious, but I would not recommend it if you are sensitive to salty dishes.

Another group favorite is  the pork belly. Because nothing can go wrong with pork fat, right? Again, served simply with rice and green beans, the braised pork belly really has nice texture and decent meat-to-fat ratio. I personally like the chicken more because it has a mild yet savory flavor that you would not mind eating frequently."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to eat in madison. Only reason i dont go as often as i want to is because i live far from it. Doesn't stop me though! Rocky really knows how to make good food and often does fun specials. Everything on the menu is amazing. The dumplings is what Soho is known for but you got to try all or any of the the rice dishes. The pork belly and the korean beef is my top faves. Also, try out their baked fried rice. Its like mac & cheese but rice and delicious goodness mixed in!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken and rice plate. The noodles are great and I wish they offered them more often. A huge bummer that they are NOT open on Sundays."}
{"text":"I eat at Soho about one a week for lunch. The owner, Rocky, is a wizard in the kitchen. The food is so flavorful and Rocky is always creating something new for customers to try. Definitely check out Soho!"}
{"text":"From food cart to restaurant, SoHo has brought Madison delicious Asian dishes that can satisfy all tastebuds. I've gotten my co-workers, family and friends addicted to the Mac n cheese dumpling, popcorn chicken and many of the rice plates. Rocky, the owner inspired by his family's dishes and his travel around the world, often brings new creation regularly, even with the daily specials he'll find a way to put the SoHo twist in it. One of the specials I miss and hope he brings back soon is a twist on a Friday Fish Fry - the Thai Style Perch Fish Fry with Papaya Salad. I can still taste it now. This post maybe be a passive aggressive cry for the Fish Fry. Hopefully he's reading this ;) [nudge, nudge]"}
{"text":"Working on the south side of Madison, I have access to a wealth of Asian food options, so I was curious to find out how SoHo Gourmet Cuisine was going to carve out a niche for itself in this crowded market. While the dumplings I sampled from the SoHo food cart this past summer failed to impress, my experience at their bricks and mortar facility was far more impressive.  When combined with passionate service and an inviting interior, the well prepared food at SoHo has my taste buds clamoring for a return visit.

When I stepped into the restaurant, I barely recognized it from its previous incarnation as a Cousin's Sub Shop.  The open kitchen, with its gleaming stainless steel fixtures immediately caught my eye.  Two large flat screens located above the counter project the menu options to prospective patrons.  The matching black chairs and tables, together with the grey and cream floor tiles provided additional flair to the space.  A boom box on a table in the center of the restaurant provided some soothing background music during my meal.  While the dining area has a flat screen TV was mounted on the wall, it was not turned on during my visit.

The focused lunch menu has three main categories: 1) Dumplings (chicken, beef and pork) 2) Rice plates (BBQ Pork, Curry and Charbroil Chicken) and 3) Salads (Lemon Balsamic, Sassy Peanut and Soy Citrus).  I elected to go with the daily special, the ginger - garlic fried rice with the $2 fried chicken skewer.  

After about five minutes, I received a massive bowl of fried rice topped with a perfectly fried runny egg.  I savored the combination of the runny yolk with the fried rice - my only regret was that I wish there was more yolk.  The fried rice was well prepared - not only did the kitchen do a terrific job of balancing the ginger and garlic components, they served the homemade soy sauce on the side, so I could control the seasoning of my dish.

The fried chicken stick was simply spectacular.  The crunchy, lightly battered exterior gave way to the succulent, well-seasoned interior.  It easily was the best $2 I spent that week.  

Rocky, the passionate owner of SoHo, personally checked in with all the patrons during the busy lunch service.  He quickly established a rapport with all the customers, whether they were newbies like myself, or repeat customers to the restaurant.

Based on this sensational experience, I can't wait to return.  The combination of speedy, enthusiastic service with flavor-packed Asian-influenced fare makes SoHo Gourmet Food a welcome addition to my South Madison lunch circuit."}
{"text":"First time going to this place. We came in with a very large group. The staff probably does not normally get groups of this size. They were very accurate and responsive to our orders. Approximately 10 people which normally isn't a lot but for this size place is a crowd. The food was really good. I recommend the Mac and cheese dumplings. They should be illegal thus are so good. Also a free beer for checking In on Yelp. You pretty much can't beat it. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So...maybe this is slightly preliminary having only eaten there once, but I had the Hong Kong BBQ Pork rice plate for lunch today and it was really friggin good. Just a basic plate of rice, really nicely cooked pork, and a little garlic & green onion oil to put over top. But sometimes a basic plate of rice and pork can be really good, and this was. About halfway through eating it, I thought to myself, \"this is about as much as I need to eat at lunch, I should save the rest for later.\" Then I finished the whole thing. Oops."}
{"text":"We did not like SoHo at all. We got takeout one Friday night and we're pretty disappointed. They were out of a couple dishes. The Mac and cheese dumplings were very bleh. Everything was so bleh to us. Maybe we just picked the wrong things however after that evening we decided we would not be coming back."}
{"text":"I have seen the food cart around town so I was interested in trying their store-front restaurant.  I got the lunch special, three dumplings and half serving of a rice dish.  The price at 8.50 was right, there was a good amount of food, and it tasted great.  

It was a quiet Friday afternoon so I had the counter guy/cook to myself.  He was friendly and quick.  It is not a deep menu but do a few things very well, and you don't need a big menu.  I look forward to the next time I am in South Madison."}
{"text":"Repeat visits a must if you can't get to the food cart. Gotta love Rocky's greeting & goodbye, as he's glad to serve it up. A Wisconsin touch with the Mac-n-Cheese dumplings. The delicious, garlicky Lo-Mein is generous serving. Couples, families, sport teams, meetings.... all come to Soho."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fresh. I loved the Chipotle chicken tacos. They were appropriately spicy with smooth tomatilo guacamole. I also tasted my husband's charbroiled chicken rice plate and it was super flavorful. I've previously had their green beans and Brussel sprout sides and loved them so much my husband has copied the style and cooks them at home with soy sauce and suracha sauce."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Asian fusion, but this restaurant is worth a try.
Heard that they have good dumplings. They had pork, chicken, and Mac-n-cheese. Was a little flavorless, but the Mac-n-cheese was very special. 
My favorite was the fried tofu. Very crispy!"}
{"text":"Great, quick Asian fusion! Love the fact the food cart now has a place! I did have to chuckle when I asked if \"Wisconsin spicy\" meant it wasn't spicy at all and the worker smiled and said, \"it's not really even spicy.\""}
{"text":"I've eaten here about seven times and have never been disappointed. Granted, this is more of a \"we've been cleaning the house all afternoon and don't want to cook\" kind of place than a first date spot (they did start as a food cart after all!). My girlfriend and I regularly split an order of dumplings, a rice dish, and the green beans (arguably the best menu item) and we are stuffed. I'd call it entry-level Asian cuisine because even my father was a fan, so don't expect anything fancy and you'll be in for a real treat."}
{"text":"We went to their first brunch this morning. The French toast was and bao were great. The milk tea is also great. I'm always surprised that our children (picky eaters) always love the food. They do a good job making a variety for everyone to enjoy."}
{"text":"Flavor Train stops here.

Everything I've ordered here is so yummy and flavorful!

Try the Green Beans or Brussel Sprouts....my mouth is watering as I write this. They are so delicious! All vegetables should be this good.

The varying daily specials (announced on Facebook) always rock.

Recently we came in for the special: Asian Style Ribs with Fried Rice.....mmm-mmm

Another favorite is Tempura Calamari. So fabulous....."}
{"text":"Very excited that there's now a permanent location.  I had the lunch combo (great deal!) with the Hong Kong BBQ Pork and the Authentic Pork dumplings.  I'd say everything was even better than the food truck.  The food was hotter and the pork and dumplings crispier.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried the traditional dumplings - very flavorful and delicious.  Also got the char broiled chicken, very tasty, loved the lightly pickled cucumber with it.  This place has unique items on the menu vs the usual stuff.  Would def go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"There aren't a ton of options to choose from in the fitchburg area, and this place has kinda fallen off my list when trying to come up with a place to eat. There is promise in some of the options, but overall I found their food to lack the excitement that I hoped for at this casual quick-dine joint. I end up just going to Panera or MOD pizza that are in the same parking lot. I want to root for them, but it doesn't seem like they have really pushed their food to where I think it could go. Oh, and a pet peeve of mine is when a place's quality doesn't match their prices - not worth it."}
{"text":"SoHo is so-oh good!!! 

I have tried a handful of things now and so far, I have enjoyed every single item. The menu is creative and innovative, and I can't wait to continue to try more of what they have to offer. 

The only reason I am docking one star is because of a minor blip-- I placed an order online for pickup (I used to live very close to the restaurant). I got confirmation my payment went through and the order was received, and given an estimate as to when it would be ready. Great, perfect. 

When I arrived, though, they hadn't received the order :( They apologized profusely and got to work right away on making up our order which was good, but it was still just a little annoying having to sit there and wait when we should have already been back home gobbling up some delicious yummies. 

I don't live over there anymore, so now I rely on the truck to get my SoHo fix. Personally I think I like ordering from the truck more than the restaurant - just seems more authentic :)"}
{"text":"Yowza! Small menu, big flavors. 
The chargrilled chicken is delicious, and the fried tofu is AMAZING. I've always enjoyed the rice bowls sold at Soho's cart on Library Mall, but Soho's new restaurant has even more on offer, and everything I've tried is great."}
