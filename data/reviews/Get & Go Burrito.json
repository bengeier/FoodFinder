{"text":"Thought we'd try out this burrito place and I'm so glad we did! The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. My wife and I both had a \"small\" burrito - no need for a large unless you want to get your daily caloric intake in one go.

I highly recommend this place and will be coming back."}
{"text":"The burritos are absolutely delicious. Amazing prices compared to fat bastards or burrito boyz but better food all around. The place is a bit small and I can see it get cluttered if their business improves. I've been there 3 times and my only disappointment was when I ate half of my cousins shrimp burrito, the shrimp was overcooked. That being said, their steak burrito is great with tender meat and packed full of meat, rice, beans and anything else you'd find in a burrito."}
{"text":"I was in the area with my son and had a craving for a burrito and noticed this one near by. With good reviews, we gave it a try.
I have to say that this was one of the best burritos I have had. The ingredients were fresh, the sauces were excellent, they grill it while you wait. I highly recommend. I personally had the chicken mango burrito on whole wheat."}
{"text":"My fav local Mexican burrito spot. Tucked into the corner I was curious one day to see what it was like.. And I wasn't disappointed. All the ingredients are fresh, and u get a big portion. And no extra for guac!!!!!!!! Usually why u see construction, police officers, ttc drivers its a mans meal if u kno what I mean. Shrimp burrito is really tasty.. And the supreme fries is a reaaaal favourite. Fries are crispy and they load them up without drenching it so it's not soggy.
Only thing is they have raised the prices on their items bc I do know before it was cheaper by 1-2 dollars.. :(
 otherwise a great spot u will be FULL"}
{"text":"I've tried their burritos and fries which were overpriced and mediocre at best. The gentleman who I can only assume was the owner was less than polite. We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Their burritos are uber delicious and they're not stingy with their stuffings/ingredients. The supreme fries are yummy for a quick dose of unhealthy goodness. You get what you pay for which is always a plus. Around $8 for a burrito. Haven't tried the quesadillas, so I can't vouch for them. Customer service is neutral. They don't really converse or smile. It's just an order and serve type of thing. I'm not really bothered by it because the appetizing food dominates everything. Overall, delish and I recommend it! (Quick tip: don't eat inside the restaurant IF you don't want to smell like onions and food afterwards)"}
{"text":"So nice to see burrito places popping up everywhere, but not all are as good as they come.  This one, I wasn't quite sure about, but it was nice to see Spanish speaking people eating here, and it gave me some confidence that the food would be good.  I enjoyed eating a steak burrito from here, with refried beans, rice and all the fillings.  I like that they have a small and large option, as we all have different appetites and the large one looks...well large!  I also appreciate that they don't stuff the burrito full of rice, and then charge you high amounts.  They only put a little bit of rice in and stuff this burrito with lots of goodness.  I will come back, as it's a convenient location, and the food is decent."}
{"text":"Great, big, filling burritos!  Had a steak burrito...delicious. It had an almost crispy shell which I loved. Also had their supreme fries...great as well!"}
{"text":"Love their burritos! Been here a few times and have never had any issues. Very tasty burritos that aren't just filled with beans and rice. I recommend adding mango to your order, adds some punch to your burrito. 
I called ahead to place my order and it was ready when I walked in 7 minutes later."}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait. Call ahead if your on your lunch and it'll be ready when you get there. Fries supreme is the bomb! Quesadillas are nice and burrito bowls are spot on."}
{"text":"The burritos are ok, you can tell the meat quality isn't that great. The toppings are standard, as you would expect. They are a bit stingy on the guacamole. The best thing they sell here is the supreme fries. If your in the are you dont have much to chose from so I recommend the place."}
{"text":"This place has pretty decent burritos. I've called twice to preorder and gotten there 15 minutes later only to find they haven't even started my order yet. Will stick to Burrito Boyz in the future as my preorders are already ready for pick up."}
{"text":"We did a take out for lunch at work from this location. I ordered their Shrimp-n-Halibut Burrito with all their topping Mexican Rice, Refried Beans, Black Beans, Cheese,Lettuce, Tomatoes,Guacamole, Green Onions,Corn,Cilantro, Jalapenos and topped it with Creamy Chili Lime sauce. They didn't cheap out on Halibut and placed a big piece in the wrap. 

Overall, It was a great combination and a very enjoyable Burrito!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located and easily accessible. The menu is quite similar to Burrito Boyz. It's extremely clean and the customer service is great. The prices are very decent and portion sizes are very good. 

We ordered the vegetarian (bean and cheese) burrito bowl and vegetarian (bean and cheese) quesadilla. The bowl was ok! A bit bland, and the veggie toppings did not taste as fresh. Not enough sauce so it was very dry. However, the quesadilla was excellent and would get that again. 

I would come back here and try the fries supreme and quesadilla again."}
{"text":"This place makes some of the best burritos in the city. I come here pretty often (borderline too often if you ask my belt) and isn't that really the best endorsement anyone can give? If you need a burrito and you're up in North York this is the place to go to. Don't bother with the places on Yonge. 

This place bless blows the \"Boys\" chain & even the \"Fat\" chain out of the water. Every one of my friends who I've sent here loves it & are also return customers so I figured it was high time I send all of Yelp there too.

Oh, also a key thing to note is that they are open til 11pm every night except Sundays which is later than every other spot in that strip mall aside from the BK that's 24hrs & they're open later than most of the places in the area in North York.

Nice people behind the counter, fresh food, and all in all good vibes. If you're up in North York and feeling hungry, check them out!

NOTE: They used to be called \"In & Out Burrito\" (or maybe it was \"In N' Out Burrito\") until they got a cease & desist letter from a certain burger chain with a very similar name that's very popular south of the border. Same place, same owners, same people behind the counter. Just a name and branding change due to legal stuff."}
{"text":"There are excellent burrito's at this place.  I had a chicken burrito loaded with everything, and it was full of flavour, filling, and an excellent lunch.  There was a fairly large lunch line-up when I was there but the staff seemed to work through efficiently. The burritos are a little slow to get grilled, but they are worth the wait.  Not much of a dining-in experience, just very basic tables and a small restraint.  Overall I would recommend this place and would go back without hesitation."}
{"text":"My go-to for burritos! One of the best burritos I've ever had, the hot sauce is amazing as well! The staff is super friendly & super organized."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here; I still feel that burrito boyz is still the staple of a great burrito in Toronto with its heap of meat stuffing and great sauces. However; this place has its own distinction.

I found the toppings to be extremely fresh. Even though it is not as stuffy as other burrito places. It is a very nice and clean presentation; not being overly stuffed made it neat to eat and also the tortillo was nice and crispy all thru out.

We all know burrito's are not the healthiest choice in the world; but the portions here are not gigantic to make you feel a little less guilty but still feed your cravings.

Will be back; but they need to step their hot sauce game up a bit tho!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome burritos and quesadillas. Good range of fresh toppings and relatively quick on the preparation. The grilling takes a while, and I see lots of complaints about that, but if they don't grill it for long enough it will fall apart in your hands as you're eating it. Don't judge the process, just love the food!

The jarritos are a great drink to wash it down with... if you haven't tried them yet, give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way to your NEW Markham store to find out its not even open yet with paper covering windows still.   Your website shows two locations and pushes the Markham store with address and menu features only available there like nachos.  ?  Get with reality dudes, what a waste of time for our party of 4 to drive all the way there to try a new place.   

So wasted 20 minute drive for 4 people and 20 minutes back!.  serious? None of your social media links work on this site.  Do you expect to survive in Markham ?"}
{"text":"Not bad but quality vs price not the greatest. Portions are pretty small. They forgot the lettuce in the salad bowl which I didn't realize until I left."}
{"text":"I just love this place! Although I have only been here twice. But, when I want Mexican this is the place my mouth salivates for. mmm.. writing this review is making me crave it now!

I ordered the Mango Chicken burrito. Superb! The balance in flavour is amazing. The rice is nicely seasoned and the touch of mango just makes it pop. But beware future customers, the hot sauce is no joke! Opt out for medium to mild. If your feeling brave, then go for it!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best burritos I've ever tried. If not, it might actually be the best....the fries supreme look like something out of a fairy tail. Hot sauce is decently hot. Very consistent. 

Ordering system could be cleaned up. The proper system should be. Order, pay, receive order number. Sometimes they forget to ask for payment all together.

Other than that best burrito in town."}
{"text":"Somewhat tucked away behind the pet gas station in the plaza out back... 

Only really knew about it until I had a friend point it out to me.  

Burrito choices galore!

I've only visited twice and always got the chicken and shrimp mix in large.  

You can always appreciate seeing someone cook the food before built eyes and it always comes out consistent.  

A variety of many fresh toppings on display to choose from,  all bright colored and yummy all the same.  

The hot sauce is not for the faint of heart.  One line is good enough for those who can't beat the heat... I always get three.  

Grilled to perfection and mouth wateringly good.  I always like when the hot sauce has traveled to the end and I am dying to finish it. Red in the face and mopping up my forehead every so often.  Respect. That's hot sauce in true Mexican tradition."}

{"text":"Considering there isn't another burrito joint in the area I was a bit skeptical when trying this place. To my surprise it has been great every burrito so far! Not at the burrito boys/fat bastard level yet but definitely a good overall burrito and their menu has expanded. A gem for the area."}
{"text":"Pretty dam good.  Halibut n shrimp great combination.  Will be back.  Needs some hot waitress serving beer!!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Man is this place ever tasty.  I wish there was one closer to downtown.

The concept is very much like all of those burrito places that have popped up around Toronto.  However, what makes this place special is that they have other things on their menu as well, including fries supreme.  The types of \"insides\" can be cheese, cheese & bean, steak, chicken, soya mix (nice for the vegetarians!), shrimp, halibut and ground beef.  I had a small steak, and have never had that much meat in a burrito before.  

They also do catering, which I would be interested in if I ever needed it.  

I made the mistake of ordering a burrito AND a fries supreme for lunch.  There was no way I could finish it myself.  It would have been better if they had a small and large fries supreme.  The fries were smothered in cheese sauce, sour cream, chilli and your choice of tomato and onion.

This place is a bit of a distance from the courthouse I work at on occasion, but but if I am craving a burrito and only have a short lunch I can call ahead and have it ready when I get there!  

The place was clean, friendly and used fresh ingredients.  Great mexican food!"}
{"text":"I work close by. Not much to eat in the area. A popular spot for the lunch crowd.

Food is decent. On par with the many burrito shops in the city. Only complaint is that the food takes a little too long to prepare for my liking. Ordered a large bean & cheese burrito as soon as I walked in as there was no line in front and it took 13 minutes to get my order."}
{"text":"Really filling and full of taste, a must try if you're in the area. The hot sauce is especially spicy, be warned even mild is hot! The supreme fries are a great snack and side and the taste is fantastic. I recommend this place to anyone in mood for a filling and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE burritos!
With a fiery passion... 
That being said, there's not much I can say about this place. It's not Bad, but there are better places to get your Mexican/American cravings.
The only negative things that I have to share are these two components.
-I ordered a Large chicken burrito bowl and still felt hungry after... I'm a 160 pound male at 5'8 so I'm not obese if that's what your thinking...
-second, the rice had some random hard grains which were either not cooked enough, or was over cooked by the heating tray/steamer

In my personal opinion, go for burrito boys or fat bastards. Higher quality, and more quantity!"}
{"text":"I'll eat here whenever I'm feeling down and it always lifts me hiiiigher! A small burrito is sufficient as it's rather large, and guac is free. 100 times better than chipotle. Also, try the fries supreme, they're pretty popular."}
{"text":"The burrito wrapper was done perfectly ... hence the wait.  Crisp outer shell.

You can control the amount of sauces you want.  Only gripe:  just not spicy enough for me.

The toppings were fresh, no doubt about it, except that the lady drenched my burrito with what appeared to be sour cream.  Will definitely pass on the cream thing the next time and probably order a vegetarian filling.  (Had the halibut which was fried) ...

Also, it is a clean place.  Busy (which is a good sign).  The shrimp burritos appeared to be very popular with the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after reading about it on BlogTO. It's an alright burrito place. Personally I prefer Burrito Boyz for a few reasons. I had the Chicken Mango burrito and my fiance had the Shrimp burrito. I liked the combination of the fresh sweet mango slices with the nicely cooked chicken, fresh cilantro, mushy beans and rice, and the slight kick from the hot sauce. However,  it was poorly wrapped and it could have been pressed a bit longer. By the time I got through a third of the burrito, it got soggy and almost was falling apart. The shrimp burrito was also poorly wrapped. Better pressed however the shrimp was completely unseasoned. Perhaps eating it altogether would be a good combination but I've had much better flavours,  consistency and wrapping at Burrito Boyz and Bar Burrito. 

We also had the fries supreme. Fries cooked fresh and all ingredients (tomatoes, onions) crisp and fresh. Didn't really like the processed cheese on top. Reminded me of a Taco Bell fries supreme.  

An alright burrito place but I won't be making the drive out over other burrito places. Nice customer service and clean looking place."}
{"text":"I first experienced In & Out Burrito about three weeks ago. I ordered Supreme Fries and a Chicken Burrito. I really was disappointed that there wasn't anyone else in the restaurant when I arrived. However, the people that worked there were still upbeat and extremely nice.

When they presented me the Supreme Fries that I ordered I asked them to add corn on top. They did it with no hesitation and didn't charge me a cent! I also ordered the Chicken Burrito for my boyfriend and I; while I was ordering I was asking the guy to help me decide what to order and told him it was for two. When the Burrito came out it was already cut in half without any suggestions! It was amazing. They really take care of the customers and I would definitely come back. 

The reason for the 3 stars and not more is that I wasn't blown away by their Supreme Fries, however I did think that the chicken burrito was amazing. 

Check this place out, it has only been open for a few months and is only due to word of mouth that this place has been popular in this area.

{"text":"Great food burritos are the best and the extreme fries are awsome.you can choose from chicken,beef or shrimp plus you choose what toppings you want.the quesadilla are great also same deal make it the way you want always fresh ingredients made right there in front of you. The staff there is awsome and always happy to help"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos! Always come here when I'm craving a burrito. I usually get a large chicken burrito with everything on it. The supreme fries are good too!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not rated this place yet. 

Hands down the best burrito place around!!!! 

Personal favourite is steak and chicken mix. Small or large, whichever will satisfy your appetite.

Must try their works fries.....yummmmmmmy!!!!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 3.5 stars but I'll round it up.

Great-tasting food, friendly service, clean place.

I just thought it was a bit pricey. A small burrito is $8 with tax and I wasn't even close to feeling full. I know it's a small but $8 should get me a little more. It's a shame because it was a great burrito. 

I'll put this in the \"visit once a year\" category."}
{"text":"Order the chicken bowl and the portion of rice was VERY scarce. I expected more seeing as it was a bowl as opposed to the burrito. Another let down was that the chicken wasn't even hot! BARELY even warm, which doesn't make much sense to me because you wait a while for the meat to prepared to finish your order. Their supreme fries on the otherhand are really good."}
{"text":"Ordered the ground beef burrito (small) and the ground beef was very dry. Maybe will try their chicken next time but definitely do not get the ground beef.

Staff was friendly but the owner was not.

2.5/5"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant with many places to sit. I went here a couple years ago and recently came back. Their food was as good as I remember, it is not going to knock your socks off with flavour and originality but it will satisfy. 

I got their quesadilla with chicken, it was nice and cheesy like it like it! Perfectly grilled to perfection. I also got some guac on the side for $1.00 which was also decent. I got a jumex which is always a nice touch for probably $2.00

I would come back again if I was in the area looking for food, best for a late night snack after a soccer game."}
{"text":"Came here the first time for lunch from work.  Excellent experience! 
The girl with the tattoo was very nice. Helped me decide what I wanted. The cashier was good too.
I ate the steak and chicken burrito and it was amazing. Will definitely come here again."}
