{"text":"So I popped in here hoping for a fresh sandwich. I've had a latte here in the past and it stood out as better than any Starbucks or Second Cup could ever hope to achieve. Tonight I had a sandwich, a custard tart and another tasty latte. I sat in the cafe area to write a bit and eat. Can I just tell you: every effing bite was so on point it's ridiculous. The sandwich was perfect, the custard tart divine and the latte..... Every sip hit the spot. This is the best meal I've had out in way longer than I can remember. Everyone is super friendly, too. I just found my new local!"}
{"text":"I often dream of their cream puff rolls ($1.50 ea). The cream is fresh, light and not overtly sweet! The puff itself is flakey to perfection.  The ladies running this business are friendly and pleasure to talk to. You cannot go wrong with trying anything off of their menu here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bakery in the GTA everything is so fresh and delicious and the Portuguese custard tarts are out of this world! Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for home baked goods. They also do custom cakes which are beautiful and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious, had the Turkey panini and was very satisfied, the cheese they used complimented the turkey very nicely. Custard tarts were ok, a bit too much vanilla and sugar but that's only personal taste as my bf loved it and after another bakery serving me a burnt tart, I can certainly appreciate this places custard tart. Bought an assortment of 6 pastries, turn overs (apple and cherry) and some sausage rolls with some spinach and cheese danishes. All were delicious. Hot chocolate wasn't too sweet and was warm and rich. In all a very good experience, I will be returning."}
{"text":"$4.25 for a butter tart, Portuguese tart and a small coffee. One of the best butter tarts I've had & paired well with the coffee. The Portuguese tart was also spot on! Home-y feel to the bakery/grocery and food space in the dining area as well. I came in to get some work done and it was nice to be out of sight with cafe sounds in the background. They're only open until 7pm, so not for the night owl looking for a place to work.   Can't wait to be back to try other foods and treats!"}
{"text":"The egg tarts are to die for!! Crispy, rich, and yummy!! Almost made standing in line at service Ontario .. enjoyable??!!"}
{"text":"Brampton has many Portuguese bakeries. So perhaps I'm spoiled and shouldn't judge a place based on one experience. But because it was rather disappointing, I don't think I'll return.  The positives: there's lots of variety of baked goods and desserts, almost to the point where you wonder if they are jack of all trades, master of none. I only had a sandwich, so I can't evaluate anything else. Seating is plentful if you choose to dine-in. I had a pressed sandwich with Portuguese cheese and salami. It tasted quite good. I also had a cappuccino which was fair.   The negatives: First, while they weren't busy and there were two people working, it still took a very long time to get my coffee and then my sandwich. I also noticed their pricing is higher than other Portuguese bakeries because they charge for everything separately e.g. extra dollar for heating/pressing the sandwich. They also had a small and large sandwich option. I ordered the small sandwich, but asked for a different cheese because their cheese options were limited to two mild flavour ones and I wanted something with a stronger flavour. While they didn't tell me, I figured it would be more expensive.  When they charged me for my meal, I was charged extra for the cheese and meat. I pointed out I had ordered a small sandwich, so I didn't understand why I was being charged extra on the meat, but apparently the person who made my sandwich had given me extra meat. Well, I didn't ask for that and it isn't my fault she gave me more. The cashier wasn't happy with my argument, even pointing out she had given me 4 slices of meat instead of 1 (as if to say I should be charged even more), but very grudgingly gave me a dollar off the bill.   Anyway, my point is I know of other Portuguese bakeries nearby where you can get consistent fast, pleasant service with a good variety and quality of food and no nickle and diming. So I don't see myself coming back."}
