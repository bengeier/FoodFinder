{"text":"I love this place.  The birthday singing thing is kitsch, and pretty annoying because it happens so frequently (6 times my last visit), but the food at Pantheon is really good.  I have been twice and have not been disappointed.  The dips combo plate is amazing, though I would ask to switch out the Taramosalata if you don't like caviar, which is too fishy for my taste.  Their pita is fantastic, and their seafood is out of this world.  Saganaki amazing, horiatiki is not the best on the strip, but passable.  3 people ate and had an alcoholic bev for $90, and had leftovers for another meal.  If you're hunting for the most authentic Greek food on the Danforth, you could do a whole lot worse."}
{"text":"Top notch all the way. The food is unbelievably good, from the calamari to the chicken souvlaki - everything is fresh and made with grandma's love. The service and ambiance are great as well. 

I should point out I've never been to Greece, but that won't stop me from saying this is one of, nay, THE best Greek restaurant on the planet... Or at least in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Greek spots. Their seafood (grilled calamari apps, scallops, etc) and saganaki (let it be the appetizer escargot or entree with scallops) always gets to me. They taste amazing and will leave you wanting more. Of course, the saganaki is very filling because of the creamy tomato base and feta cheese, but it's to die for!

Their wine prices are very fair, averaging $35-45 for a bottle. Even the lower range wines taste good,  making the entire dinner experience better!

Their service is fine. This is more of a local restaurant, so don't expect 5-star service. However, they can be funny and pop a joke here and there. 

Best part: servers singing happy birthday! Loudest man working will make sure you can hear them sing happy birthday from one end of the restaurant to outside the patio. Surrounding tables will definitely applaud -- mostly applauding the singer for his amazing performance."}
{"text":"Reliable choice for Greek food. Generally a busy place so plan accordingly. Good service, large portions so consider sharing main entrees."}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant I've eaten at. It's always busy. The waiters never smile, but that's part of the charm. Fast service, good food. The only time I've been disappointed was when they ran out of potatoes. How does that happen!? If I'm on the Danforth, I wouldn't want to go anywhere else for Greek food."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during the Taste of the Danforth. The decor is cute. We had the grilled calamari and (sorry can't remember the name) spinach-pastry-appetizer dish. The grilled calamari was a bit salty for my taste, but was still cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend it! Likely to visit again to try other things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Pantheon has the best grilled calamari I have ever tasted!

My boyfriend and I usually order the grilled calamari dinner and split it between the two of us.  Its more than enough for us to share.  It is delicious and it is always consistent - we've never had a bad experience.

The people are super nice.  It's a family-run business.  The place is always packed with people either inside or out on the patio.  I think its the best greek restaurant on the Danforth!

Keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant on the Danforth. The grilled calamari is amazing and always fresh. I'm also a big fan of the grilled loukaniko and souvlaki. The patio is really nice during the warmer months."}
{"text":"Great place 

It has really good grilled calamari.
Staff is great and if anything goes wrong they have a great solutions.

I recommend having the calamari and lamb chops if your with someone. 

If you want a quick bite just the calamari is a great way to fill up. 
I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Pantheon offers authentic Greek cuisine at a very reasonable price. I went to this place 5PM at a Saturday night, and many tables were reserved. Luckily, a few tables were free, so I was served right after I entered.

I ordered the Greek salad, grilled calamari, and pork souvlaki. The salad was refreshing and yielded the flavor of the Mediterranean. The calamari was tender and succulent even amid other restaurants serving dry, rubbery calamari. The souvlaki was juicy and grilled to perfection. Not to mention free bread.

The service was great, generously offering to refill our water and to refill the bread basket. Overall, Pantheon is a great Greek culinary experience and among the best that the Danforth can offer."}
{"text":"My (only) Greek friend told me that this is his favourite place for Greek food in the city.  I have been here a few times now and it is very good. They give you complementary bread, dips and cake for desert, so be careful how much you order.  Each time I have gone I have had leftovers. The food was tasty and I was satisfied, but I wouldn't drive out to the Danforth to eat here, but if I am going to a concert at the Danforth Music Hall this is my spot."}
{"text":"I came here after lunch with a friend, and I had ordered a chicken souvlaki.  Instead of the salad being on the same plate as the chicken and potatoe, the salad came before on a separate plate. The ingredients on the salad were fresh and the only drawback is that it had only 1 olive on it.  I have had many greek salads before, and this is the only restaurant or fast food joint that I have ever been to that served only 1 olive (it's not a mistake when this was the case on both my and my friend's salad).  As we like olives, we were hugely disappointed by this restaurant which had received such high yelp ratings. The chicken was okay, not as juicy as I had expected. I would not come back again considering this restaurant was only mediocre for their above average price."}
{"text":"Eat here.  An incredible food experience. We went with another couple and ordered the olives, flaming cheese, dips with beans and octopus and the seafood platter for two.  It was way too much food but super delicious.  We went without a reservation and there was a line out the door but worth waiting for.  I can't say enough good things about our experience here."}
{"text":"Food wise this place is between 2.5-3.  Service wise, i would give this a 4.5.  There was this one male server there that was just fabulous.  I wish we had him from the start.  

As this was my first time there, a little recommendation would've been nice.   Too bad our server didn't really recommend anything and just took our order.   

The other guy,  always came by to see how we were doing and always had our glass of water filled up. As i told him this was our first visit, he was so nice to bring over a very generous piece of honey cake that was on the house.  He than recommended us to try the Greek  coffee.  Even though is was pretty bitter, it was just nice of him to offer.

Going back to the food... jumbo shrimp and the lamb chops were pretty good.   The chicken brest, sausage  and the lamb diner was just average.  I was surprised  to see how different the lamb chops were compared to the lamb dinner.  It was like day and night when it came to the flavour, quality and presentation.  Just disappointed  in the lamb dinner.  Looked pretty shitty... it was served like meat loaf..lol

Will i come back... maybe.  My rating might have been higher if i got the other guy to start with."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food! The place is usually busy with a good friendly vibe. I had the chicken souvlaki dinner and grilled calamari and it was delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant if you're feeling for delicious Greek food!"}
{"text":"Love the food here.... and the complimentary dessert is always a great ending to the meal!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Greek restaurant. I always have the marinated octopus, followed by the pork souvlaki dinner. I know that pork souvlaki is boring, but this is really good and I find myself craving it. Service is always good and whoever i bring always enjoys it."}
{"text":"You have quite a few options for Greek food when you're in this area, but Pantheon has to be one of my favourites. The restaurant is known for two things: (1) fresh seafood, and (2) really huge portions. The grilled calamari is one of my favourites - none of that chewy rubbery stuff, and as mentioned, the portions are huge! 

If your waistline can take it, the Saganaki (flambeed Kefalotiri Cheese) is a must. They flame it up table side, giving you an entertaining show before you devour a gigantic block of bubbling melty cheese. I'm literally drooling just typing this out!

And like everyone says, there is a complimentary slice of honey cake at the end. Not too sweet, and wraps up the meal nicely."}
{"text":"Went to Pantheon on the weekend with my BF for our two years.
Everything was great.  The feast began with three different types of dips with bread, for free.  We then ordered a Saganaki (flaming cheese) app, as well as a Hot Combo plate for 2 which included grilled calamari, grilled octopus, sausage, 2 spanakopites, 2 dolmades. The food was really good, as Pantheon is known for their seafood and such.  Service was also very excellent. They even brought us free Ravani at the end of our date, which is a greek dessert.  We also got two bottles of Retsina, which you can never go wrong with.

One downside is that the meal was quite expensive.  Not too expensive, but it still was pricey. They also charged us when I asked for some pita for our saganaki.  Strange, because you'd assume you would get some free pita with a $14 cheese. 
Anywho, we left with our belly's full so we were happy."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went with my husband after my last day of my first semester teaching college and no one talked to us at our table for almost 20 minutes except the guy who brought us bread. 

We were just about to leave when a server came up and said, \"ok?\" Uh, ok? Some sort of apology would have put us in a better mood. 

Food was okay, salad was great, the rest was average. Service never improved. Food was overpriced. Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"A friend and I just dropped in during the Taste of the Danforth. Food was great and service was efficient, which is all that we wanted, despite the fact that the restaurant was packed. Pantheon is one of the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"After years of frequenting another nearby restaurant, I decided to give something new a try - so I stopped in at Pantheon. The restaurant is nothing new for many, who have sung its praises in reviews, and now another voice will join that chorus. The atmosphere upon entering is warm and he service was friendly and attentive. The horiatiki salad was lovely, and my vegetarian souvlaki superb. It is proof that even a very basic dish can be made better through care, fresh ingredients and good presentation. The potatoes on the side were tender and delicious. Little things do make a difference - it is a nice treat not to have to wait ten minutes for someone to acknowledge you if you need a refill on your water - here the staff seemed to come by just often enough so that you didn't even need to ask, but they were not so intrusive as to make you feel they were hovering. The chicken souvlaki was also delicious, and the smells and sights of other patrons' dishes made me wish I could sample at least half a dozen other dishes. A winner all around."}
{"text":"Great place, the food is incredibly fresh and tasty and the service is friendly and fast. We've been there many times and have always had a great experience. Grilled calamari is my favorite as it's fresh and succulent. 

You won't be disappointed. If you enjoy Greek food, this place is a must."}
{"text":"My fave Greek restaurant on the Danforth !  I grew up in the neighbourhood (Heretismata Ellines ! )  and know my Greek food - Pantheon never disappoints:  recommend:  grilled calamari; appetizer combo ; souvlaki.  Haven't tried the seafood yet.  Service is professional and unhurried for the most part.  Singing busboy is, at best, annoying.  Desserts can be a bit boring, so instead I suggest you head on down the street to Athens Pastries for some bougatsa (custard pie) and coffee, instead of staying for dessert at Pantheon.     Can't beat the basics, though - I go there once a month."}
{"text":"First time visiting Pantheon. Very simple and relaxed environment....but i find the best restaurants tend to have this type of atmosphere.

The food: Excellent. Try the lamb chops!

The service: Excellent. Very friendly staff. The food came out super fast. My girlfriend and i were even treated to complementary dessert (honey cake). I'm guessing the waiter knew it was our first time so he went out of his way to treat us.

Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"We went to Pantheon on a Sunday afternoon, sat on the patio to enjoy every bit of sun we can before Fall comes.  Our server was super friendly and offered us water and brought us some bread and butter. We ordered the grilled calamari and a chicken souvlaki dinner.

The calamari was amazing and flavorful. The tender sweetest of the freshest seafood with the smokiness of the char just danced in my mouth. Even our little 11 month old daughter loved it! 

The souvlaki on the otherhand was a little disappointing. It wasn't as juicy as I had hoped, perhaps we should have ordered the pork. 

The pita was super yummy too! Just make sure you order the calamari when you visit, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"It is Greek food with a soul. They make great calamari and grilled meats (chicken, lamb and pork). It is a great place to visit if you are in the neighborhood and craving Greek food!"}
{"text":"I love this place so hard. We got our food and on first bite we all looked at each other in delicious bliss. Not another word was spoken for the remainder of time it took us to eat. The lamb simply melts in your mouth, the potatoes are scrumptious, the wine was perfect and I can't wait to go back here. Oh I almost forgot the service! SUPER friendly, amazing, my water glass was never empty... yum yum yum."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely a fan of this place for birthdays because you always get a really loud happy birthday song. Often times you get a free honey cake at the end of the meal from the friendly waiters too. Something I'd definitely order every time I come here is the saganaki, aka the flaming cheese. Calamari here is also very tasty. Often times when I come here, my parents and I end up ordering just 2 entrees for 3 people due to the large portion sizes.

One thing that I, however, do not recommend is the ortykia dinner. The grilled quails often end up just dry, bland and overdone with a lack of meat to eat off them. Aside from that, everything else on the menu is great to eat and I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had the grilled calamari and the lamb chops. Great customer service! Feels like a family owned restaurant. Loved the honey cake at the end. Defs worth trying!"}
{"text":"It might not be as trendy as some of the other places on the Danforth, but the food is outstanding. The atmosphere and service are too. The grilled calamari is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Nothing special don't get me wrong the food is good but like most Greek restaurant on the Danforth service needs work always seems when you ask them for something your bothering them."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. Everything was so fresh and delicious! The best fried calamari I've ever had! I ordered the pork souvlaki and my friend had the grilled Sea bass. So good! The waitstaff are very friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I am Greek and whenever I go to Danforth for Greek food pantheon is only place I go. Servers are friendly and food is just amaizing. I never come here for souvlaki cuz everything else is so much better.  They are known for their fresh fish which rocks but my 2 fav things are the fried calamari ....best in city...and shrimps saganaki....one of the best things I've eaten.  Prices are a little high for apps but they give u a lot of food. My fiance and I come here and we get those 2 dishes and we are good to go....grilled calamari and octopus are great too.  Plus the have proper tzatziki  here which is a bonus. Roast lamb is notable also and bakliaro ...fried salted cod served with garlic potato puree...is probably best I've had in Toronto also if u wanna try some actual Greek dishes."}
{"text":"Get the scallops appetizer for a main with the fried cheese. Perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent!!  This is our favorite Greek restaurant on the Danforth.  Everything is wonderful here--especially the calamari (grilled is even better than fried), the souvlaki, lamb, melizanosalata (eggplant salad), and the spanakopita.  The service is prompt and very friendly, and the atmosphere relaxed and festive.  One of the very best restaurants we've tried outside of Greece!"}
{"text":"So your first boyfriend from 1995 who looked like the dude from Alice in Chains is now working at Pantheon. Now, instead of a douchy guy in ripped jeans, he's lost the attitude and transformed into a superfriendly waiter who brings you tender grilled calamari, giant salads, AND gratis bread, tzatziki and honey cake. Oh, and he's Greek now."}
{"text":"Just steps from the Chester TTC Subway station, this is the place for Grilled Calamari either as a shared appetizer or a main dish. It comes fork tender with lemon & olive oil. Roast Ontario Lamb greek style comes with the usual Greek Salad, Lemon Roast potatoes and Rice.
Service is friendly, crisp & professional. Small side-walk patio in summer."}
{"text":"I went here once and I wasn't impressed.

We had spanakotiropitas as appetizers and they were pretty good. My girlfriend's was cold in the middle, they took it back and heated it up for her.

We had quail and lamb for our main courses. The plating was old-fashioned, the vegetables were bland and the meats lacked flavour. It was my first time trying quail, it was served on the bone and very very dry. I had no idea how to eat it. I carved away with a knife and fork but it would have been much easier to chicken-wing it.

The reviews I read were encouraging, but it would take some serious convincing to get me to pay for another meal in this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience!

I went to Pantheon last night with a party of 10 and had a super time. The decor is great - a bit kitsch, but very much made me feel like I was back in Greece (I was a tourist, not a native, so take that into account). Lots of entertaining service moments - the terrible, loud, and entertainingly enthusiastic rendition of the happy birthday song stands out. As does the (equally loud) performance/delivery of flaming cheese. Mmm. 

Our server was fantastic and definitely made the difference between a 4 and 5 star experience. We were well taken care of and not once (not even when my aunt asked him to show her how to cut her whole fish, which he did with care and attention) did we feel like any of our requests were a hassle. He brought complimentary dips while we decided on our meals and for dessert a few slices of the delicious honey cake that other yelpers have raved about. Perhaps 'the norm', but nice touches all the same. 

The food was also pretty great. We asked our server to recommend the best appetizers (he chose saganaki and grilled calamari) and we were not disappointed. The saganaki was good - hard to go wrong with melted cheese, though, so no big surprise there. The grilled calamari was... delightful. I would come back just to eat the calamari. Perfectly cooked - not a hint of toughness. I'd kind of like to be eating it right now. 

I'd say the low point was the Greek salad we all had prior to dinner. The olives (straight front Greece) and feta were good, but all the other components (iceberg lettuce, lacklustre tomatoes) were no great shakes. I wouldn't avoid it if it came with a meal in the future, but I would advise against ordering this on its own. Disappointing. 

My highlight was definitely my entree. I ordered a fish special (red snapper), not really sure what to expect, and received a beautifully cooked and seasoned whole fish! It was a surprise and one that just happened to remind me of the last time I had a whole fish with slightly crispy skin and just a bit of butter sauce, which was at a little seaside restaurant in a little fishing town in Greece. I was thrilled. Everyone else at my table enjoyed their meal as well. Chicken souvlaki and steak salads both looked great. My brother had lamb which was good but he wouldn't order it again after seeing all the other options at the table. 

Definitely a winner. I will return to Pantheon, likely many times. A great place to take family and friends visiting the area to show off the Greek restaurants on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Delicious food and some of the best Greek food I've had.  Service was wonderful as well- very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Greek on the Danforth.  Fast service, really great quality food and portions, and nice atmosphere. 

The signing waiter is a really treat. Also with larger or special meals, they'll often throw in some extra treats for free :)

Often packed while most others are empty, so make sure you can get a seat!"}
{"text":"Very fun and authentic place! It was my birthday, and our waiter bought us birthday shots. They also had an older man come and sing happy birthday in front of all the locals which was very neat! The portions were generous and very good."}
{"text":"I read good reviews about Pantheon and decided to check it out. I we came in a group of 4 on a Saturday evening. Make sure you get a reservation because this place gets really busy. I was able to get a last minute reservation @ 6pm.

Food:
The food is excellent! I absolutely loved the roast lamb dish with a side of potatoes and sauteed vegetables. We also ordered appetizers of grilled calamari and grilled octopus. The appetizers were a little pricey for what you get in quantity. My entree was a 4.5/5. So succulent and full of flavor. If you come here, try the lamb. The calamari does indeed lives up to the hype. Very fresh and moist. Really one of the best I've had. The octopus is even better. Every bite was heavenly. Soft and not chewy.

Service:
The staff and management are very friendly and courteous. Food came very fast and at times I felt a little rushed. Too rushed.There was always a lineup at the door. It was a Saturday so I understand why. Service gets 3.5/5

If you decide to check out Pantheon, make sure to make a reservation if you go at a busy time. I will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Most of the Greek food in Toronto are salty and greasy. The meals we had were not salty; they are very tasty and carrying the authentic taste! The grilled squids were so good, which reminded me the grilled squids I had in Israel.
The service here - excellent - very friendly !!!!
I would recommend anyone who wants to have a more authentic Greek food in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek place to go on the Danforth.  The food is fantastic and, to me at least, more authentic then a lot of other places around.  My favourite is the whole grilled fish.  Delicious!  They also make a great grilled calamari as others have said.

In my experience it's always busy so it helps to have a reservation.  The servers are fun and really work hard to give you a great experience.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"The service was fine, but the food is dull and the atmosphere feels completely worn out."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my birthday celebration and was happy I did!

The food was extremely filling and delish. We ordered the saganaki (sp?) and hummus to begin with and it was very worthwhile watching the flames the cheese had. I ordered and shared the Chicken Souvaki with a friend and we stuffed ourselves to finish the whole plate! The potatoes was my favourite part of the whole plate (SALTY POTATOES!) The chicken was prepared just the way I like it - it wasn't dry at all!  I tried some of the grilled calamari my friend order and it was a good experience for my first time trying it! 

The service was very friendly. Waters/Waitress were always checking on us to make sure if our cups of water was filled and if we needed anything else. 

It was nice that they gave us a piece of the honey cake!! (:

Will def. be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"We waited for 30 minutes before they took our order. Once they started paying attention to us the service was very good. The food was extremely good. Most of us liked the octopus the best but I liked the grilled calamari the best. The chicken, lamb chop, hummus and spanikopita were all really good. Atmosphere was very casual. The decorations were super gaudy. The feeling was extremely personal and family run. The prices very reasonable. They made up for the wait!"}
{"text":"Greek food is my favourite. This is my favourite Greek place, and that's really saying something. 

The greek salad dressing is addictive, their hummus flawless, their souvlaki perfectly juicy. I've been here countless times - for one-on-one dinners with my boyfriend before catching a show at the Danforth, to hosting a 22-person 85th birthday party for my grandfather here. Every time, no matter the occassion, the food has been delicious (and often you get free honey cake at the end of the night, score!), and the service impeccable.  

This is a must-visit, imho."}
{"text":"A very disappointing lunch.

The service was good but the food was Unimpressive. 

I had a chicken souvlaki  on a pita with a salad.  The chicken was very salty and had no other flavour.  The salad was uninspired and bland. So was the taziki sauce.

I went looking for great Greek good and could have gotten better at a food court.  Disappointing. Avoid."}
{"text":"Meh.  I ordered a chicken souvlaki.  It came with a greek salad as a starter and the entree.  The greek salad had a bit too much oil.  So much that it ended up dripping on my mom's blouse.  Also, it was made with boring iceberg lettuce.  Meh.  The chicken was cooked really well.  The potatoes that came with it were kind of boring, the rice pilaf was a little oily.  My husband ordered the pork souvlaki and was SUPER pleased with it.  My parents also tried the marinated grilled chicken breast and it was super tender and seasoned really well.  My mom got lucky and was served steamed vegetables with her meal, which I wish I got.  The tatziki was creamy and flavorful.  The portions were big.  Prices were fair.  

The service was awesome.  The waiter was always around, asking if we needed anything.  Had a great sense of humor and even gave us a dessert to share for free!  We got lucky and were seated outside, during nice weather, with good company.  Could you find better Greek food on the Danforth?  Maybe.  Is the ambiance, service and meat preparation decent enough to go again?  Sure. 

As a side note, I wish yelp let me give it a 3 1/2 stars versus a 4, but I got bullied into this rating.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome... went with special K and Jimmy the Greek.  it helps when going to the Greek restaurant with a Greek guy... we ate like champs and were literally full by the time entrees came out.  ended up walking it off from chester to pape stations and back.

anyhow, we ordered the flaming cheese, charcoal octopus, grilled quails, cod dip and fried cod, got salad with feta, lamb chops, and spec K got pantheon shrimps.  It was fantastic; by far the charcoal octopus was everyone's favorite, tender and flavorful.  The cod dip with was interestingly good and while I am generally not a cheese fan, that flaming cheese appetizer was delicious.  I've had better quail and fried cod elsewhere though.  The cheese and octopus is a must order for anyone who goes.  The lamb chops (4 sizeable ones) were tender and done right (medium).  Jimmy was so full he didn't even finish his.  I couldn't even eat the garlic mash potatoes or veggies that came with it as I was so full.  The pantheon shrimps spec K ordered were covered with two kinds of cheese over shrooms and rice.  It looked rich and K couldn't finish it all either.  We basically waddled out of the place.  The decor was nice and we sat inside but next to the patio so we got cover from the sun and was in the open air but still felt the coolness of the ac.  The bill came out to $170 not including tip.  It was pricey but seriously, we had no business in ordering 5 appetizers and 3 rounds of drinks (maybe only 2 rounds).  And speaking of business, we had special K expense it so it was free for me and Jimmy the Greek.  And if you're wondering if you should go, simply to sum it up: the food reminded Jimmy of home."}
{"text":"Excellent greek restaurant. Kids loved the calamari and the chicken souvlaki. Waiter was so nice with everyone. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for grilled seafood and you get good bang for the buck.

Fair prices (I'm reviewing the seafood) and good dining atmosphere for both couples and families.

Grilled Octopus!"}
{"text":"Yum. Some items are pricey but worth it.  Not fast food so expect to wait.  The wait is worth it.  Generous helpings and generous with bread, pita and sauces.  This place will not disappoint.  Family friendly environment and great food options for kiddos.  Go to place for Danforth."}
{"text":"Went to Pantheon for a friend's bday this weekend. I found the food to be very cooked and seasoned very well and the decor was typical of older Greek restaurants. I wasn't overly impressed with the menu I would like to see something new then just the typical Slovakia basics. Although it is a good bang for your buck as the price was right. The best part of the night was one of our waiters singing happy birthday to my friend...you have to be there to know what I mean."}
{"text":"I used to always try new Greek restaurants on the Danforth, but after finding Pantheon, I knew I found the best one, so I never go anywhere else anymore! The food and service here is amazing! They have the best chicken souvlaki, amazing calamari (both grilled or fried), their daily fish of the day is always fresh and delicious, I love their eggplant dip, and of course their honey cake is incredible!!! And they have excellent service, the waiters are always friendly, attentive and helpful!"}
{"text":"The food and service were very good at this place. The greeters and servers were very attentive to our needs. The decor was interesting though some may see them as outdated. I like the posters of prominent Greek figures that were on the wall. The food was fine, the calamari was fresh and flavourful. The lamb was roasted well. I thought the price was a little high compare to other Greek places I have been to.  Keep in mind that I am a part time worker and full time student so pricing is usually a priority."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service.
Waiter was rude. Small portions and horrible taste
Never going back"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly, took about 5 min for they guy to take our order. 4 min later our starters came out. 7min later our mains came out.

Food was good, portions were a little small, for 1$ less at magic spot you get so much more food with the same quality.

But it was good food

Thanks"}
{"text":"Good service. This is  a nice restaurant situated in Greek town. I recommend getting the cheese that flame up(Saganaki), if you choose the Saganaki shrimp it won't flame up but it's filling and so satisfying. They provide complimentary bread in the beginning and it was easy to eat lots of it.The 4 of us split 2 large souvlaki platters and an order of Saganaki shrimp. 

Each of us got a complimentary honey dessert. It was very rich and soft.

I like this place because of the culture and vibe. You definitely pay for quality here. We were lucky enough to get seats when we walked in. I would come back to this place if I don't have to wait. When we started eating and before we left, the line up didn't stop. 

 The souvlaki platters have different sizes (small or large) we got large and was expecting for way more. Even if we were expecting for way more, we were satisfied. I tried both the pork souvlaki and chicken and found the pork dry. The chicken was moist. Also the tatziki they provide are in small portions so if you come at a busy time order extra ahead of time. The Tatziki was smooth thick and rich, I enjoyed every bit of my meal here. Our server was amazing.

I would take my international visitors here on special occasions."}
{"text":"Have I been hiding under a rock all this time?! I've tried several Greek restaurants on the Danforth, but how did I miss this place??

It is phenomenal here- hands down this is my favourite Greek restaurant so far!
Our lovely sever was Bobby. He small chatted with my family and I, and learned that this was our first time visiting. Right then and there he offered us to try a trio dip (taramosolata, hummus and the tirokafteri) on the house, we couldn't say no! 

The food was delicious. We had the moussaka, fish filet, lamb souvlaki and the fishkebob souvlaki. I have to say the fish filet was cooked to perfection- perfectly crisp on the outside, and flaky and moist in the inside. The lamb souvlaki was full with flavour and was cooked perfectly medium (and I don't even like lamb!).The calamari is a must try as the other Yelper's have suggested. All portions were generous, you're bound to leave with a food coma!

The service was really the cherry on top.  Our waters were always filled, we not only had complimentary dips, rice AND honey cake, but also enjoyed getting to know Bobby and a little history about this family owned restaurant. Thank you Pantheon for your amazing food, and impeccable service! We will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place gets such great reviews. We just had dinner there and the best part was when we left. I've been twice before and you won't fool me a third time, we will never come back. The food is awful and the service is pushy. Our waiter brought out the free dessert before I was half done my meal. Over priced and horrible quality. There are much better options then this place. Thanks for robbing me of my money!!"}
{"text":"These people really know how to make you feel welcome! Nothing short of representing greek culture. Super friendly and attentive staff, might I add - the waiters are true superstars. This place can get mighty busy, even the bussers use their rapport if they get a request from diners. I'm glad the waiters listen to them. :)

We ordered the meat platter and while the sausages were a hit, the liver and chicken were overcooked. Perhaps I was expecting a lot from the food but I do have a sweet tooth and the complimentary walnut cake is just lovely (albeit SUPER sweet but whatever)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, we had the chicken and lamb souvlaki. Lamb was a little on the rare side when asked for medium. Provided with free dips and dessert."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a weekday, and were fortunate to find parking right in front of the restaurant.  Even though the place was full, we received prompt and attentive service. Food was great - bread, salad, entrees, and the free honey cake for dessert. Would definitely return the next time we are in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great Greek restaurant!!! My boyfriend and I shared a grill mix and pork souvlaki, they come with salad and we got a nice dessert for free. Very big portion and good price. Amazing lamp chop!!!"}
{"text":"All the glowing reviews for this place have me doubting my much less than stellar experience. We were craving good Greek food, so we decided to come here mostly due to all the rave reviews on Yelp :) 

When we got here, the restaurant was full and the hostess immediately asked us if we had reservations. We said no, and she seemed less than impressed by this. She walked away to show another group to their table and came back about 5 minutes later, pointed us to a table and walked off. She couldn't even be bothered to walk us to the table,smile or hand us a menu for that matter. Pantheon really should consider having a friendlier person working as a hostess. 

A waiter came by soon after, introduced himself and handed us a menu. We decided to get the fish of the day (my mom and I) to share, and my boyfriend decided on the pork souvlaki dinner. Our waiter recommended the Red Snapper and he got us the biggest one they had for us to share. We also got the fried calamari to share as an app. The calamari was delicious. Golden, crispy, big rings that were obviously the fresh, not frozen variety. And most importantly, they weren't greasy at all. I loved these! 

We got complimentary \"Greek\" salads with our dinner, which were pretty standard and boring, but ok I guess. And then our main courses arrived. The grilled Red Snapper was delicious and definitely enough for two to share. The sides (rice pilaf,potatoes and veggies) was a tiny little portion that would have hardly been enough for me alone, let alone both of us. The rice was standard, and the potatoes were awesome! But the veggies were clearly the stuff you get from the frozen section at your local grocery store. My boyfriend said his pork wasn't very good and kind of dry. 

Aside from the bitter hostess, service was great. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive and our water was topped off regularly. We also got a piece of honey cake on the house which was nice. The cake was sweet and moist and I really enjoyed it. 

There's a ton of great options in the Danforth to choose from, so I am in no hurry at all to return here."}
{"text":"Roast lamb wasn't very roasted, no bone and had a strange gravy flavour but was tender. Chicken souvlaki had freakishly large pieces of chicken which were good but again, didn't seem right.  Disapointed with the platter, too much empty space on the plate. Few pieces of boiled vegetables here and there and no rice. Looked a bit like something you'd get in a seniors dining hall. 

Service was decent. We went in early on a Saturday night so we didn't have to wait.

Also, online menu is out of date (prices went up)."}
{"text":"I have been dying for some good calamari and I was hoping that all of the glowing reviews for this place were true. I was thrilled to find out this place knows how to grill a squid.

I sat outside with my girlfriend so we did not get a great look at the interior. The patio was a nice spot to sit on a spring night and we had a great view of the passers-by. We decided to split the grilled calamari and a shrimp dish whose name I forget.

The calamari was the best I've ever had in Toronto and it brought me back to the time I ate fresh calamari in Taiwan. If you are looking for a great version of this dish, this is your restaurant.

The shrimp dish was essentially shrimp with melted cheese and mushrooms. It was very tasty but I would have been fine with about half the quantity of cheese. It seemed like they put on as much as they did so that they could fill the plate without having to use that many shrimps.

I would definitely return for the calamari and I would be excited to try out some of the other dishes as well."}
{"text":"I came here for Father's Day with my Dad and brother, got seated right away at dinner time, ordered four different entrees. First I'll talk about the service which was absolutely amazing. The waiter we had was serving most of the restaurant, as busy as he was he still made a very concerted effort to help us with our order and repeatedly check on us. He gave us pita on the house and at the end of the meal he gave us a delicious piece of Greek honey cake. Overall service was unbelievable and the food was just as good. I will come back."}
{"text":"Wandered in here during Taste of the Danforth. The octopus on Greek salad was light and just right after gorging on a bunch of street food before we went to this resto.

The highlight was hearing one of the sweet-natured, elderly waiters with his arms outstretched, belt out an intentionally rowdy, and badly out-of-tune rendition of \"happy birthday tooooo youuuuu!!!!\" to two different tables. We also got a free slice of honey cake!"}
{"text":"Came to this place after I was struck by a craving for grilled octopus, and Pantheon was recommended as one of the best places in the city to get it.  The food was yummy (including the octopus; dip platter was great too), the atmosphere is very casual and the service friendly (but definitely not a fine dining atmosphere). I will be back - after trying a couple of other along the danforth strip that have been recommended to me."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with Pantheon Restaurant. Six of us went for dinner and unfortunately we were all very unhappy. The meat platter we ordered was drowning in oil and some pieces were very over cooked. The calamari which is usually great was terrible!  It seemed as if they hadn't changed the oil they fry it in for months. We had lots of leftovers and in the end, nobody wanted to take anything home.  I'm really hoping this was just a bad night for them. This is not our first visit to Pantheon, but sadly may be our last :("}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday evening for dinner. Ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner and their grilled calamari as an appetizer.

The calamari was really good perfectly grilled.  The chicken souvlaki was delicious as well, the chicken was cooked well and tasted really good. However, we did not receive vegetables with our dinner as was stated on the menu.
One thing was the slow service. We ordered the chicken souvlaki. The table next to us showed up half an hour after and ordered the same thing. They received their dinner way ahead of us.
Which wasn't very nice as we were waiting for a while.

Other than that, the greek fries, the salad and the dips were just average. The salad had one olive in it. Just one.. Nothing spectacular. I am sure there are much better Greek restaurants in Toronto and this is not as good as it gets.

Overall, this is a nice place to go to for a dinner, but messinis next door had souvlaki which is just as good and at half the price."}
{"text":"Pantheon is the real deal. Real down-home Greek food at decent prices. It's the place my (much) better half and I go to when we want the classics: grilled octopus, taramosalata, spanakopita, fried zucchini and eggplant, a proper Greek salad, etc.

Tip #1: When you go to a proper Greek restaurant, don't order the souvlaki dinner with rice, potatoes and salad. Just don't do it. It's like going to Chinatown and ordering chicken chow mein.

My recommendation: the first time you go, order some dips (taramosalata, hummus, melizanosalata ), a hot appetizer platter for two, and if you want your vitamins, a Horiatiki (country) salad - tomatoes, olives, onions and feta - the kind of Greek salad you get in Greece. Hot appetizers include octopus (the best I've had in Toronto), calamari, loukaniko sausage, spanakopita, etc. On our latest visit, we also ordered the chicken livers, which come on a sizzling plate with onions and mushrooms - delicious! (Yes, there were more than two of us.)

Sometimes you get free dessert - ravani, AKA honey cake. Yum! Almost as good as my better half's.

And if you're really lucky, one of the waiters will sing for you. Trust me. This you gotta hear."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Yelpers you are deranged if you think this is good food. 

Service: The waiter was perfunctory, bordering on rude (sorry to inconvenience you with our business), the food was TERRIBLE and it was served on plastic plates. Seriously? Plastic plates and plastic flowers on the table? The salad: white limp flag-like pieces of ice berg, weird oily dressing (not enough vinegar or salt or pepper) bland feta (how is that possible?) underripe tomato and maybe one shred of onion. Shredded cabbage was the most flavourful part of the salad, so that should tell you something. SO disappointing given the choices we have on the Danforth. The souvlaki was good but I didn't even get a full tablespoon of tzatziki, and the plate was swimming in grease. Bread was blah too. 

I would never, ever go back. It was packed and a manager or someone seemed to notice we were unhappy but if that's the standard for how their food is made what's the point of complaining?"}
{"text":"For Greek authenticity, it does not get better than this one.  The decor, staff, and foods are all real Greek.  My host spoke and order in Greek and we were all feel very charmed.

As a restaurant, the food is tasty but honestly not that exotically foreign.  The Greek Cabernet was good, but not outstanding.  The grilled sea bass that I order was well made and delicious too.  The best dish was actually the appetizer octopus.

The issue probably is that Greek foods are not really that unique (unlike Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, or Italian).  They are dishes common to many restaurants, like lamb chops and grilled fish.

I definitely won't go out of my way for this restaurant.  But if I am in Greek town Toronto, this will be my choice one."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience...............and the food was great too! 

John our host was a gem! 
WE Can not say enough good things about our meal there. We'll definitely return the next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Eaten here a bazillion times - very solid folky cuisine, casual but nice place.

I don't recommend the fish special unless you know in advance what you're paying - anyway there's a perfectly good filet (Orange Roughy? check) on the menu at a fixed price, so don't pay a three-steak price for the catch o' the day that may not be much different under the crispy salty buttery brown crust.

No, they don't load up the entree sides with anything all that special and there's a single small olive on the plate, but the slight stinginess is overlooked for the consistent & comforting classic food served piping hot by respectful staff. Yes the chicken souflaki is good and yes you might as well get a large if hungry, but you don't really have to."}
{"text":"Grilled Calamari was very good - not excellent.  Fried Calamari - perfectly done.  They were stingey on the tzadziki.  But if you want more just ask for extra - even when you ask for extra it's still not enough.  The little amount they give you is just stupid little.  Saganaki opa - just ok.  I like it medium opa'ed - the quality of the cheese was just at the mid-level.  I really want to try their grilled fish, but didn't see it on the menu.  The first time I went there the service was ok.  The second time I went there the service was fantastic.  The third time I went there it was horrible.  Would you pay $40 a head for horrible service?  Place was a bit run down, but clean. Laid back.  A lot of families and elderly in the crowd. I would recommend going there with at least one other person - then you can share plates - for more variety."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Pantheon,
The Lady Killer Bobby was our waiter..
Great job all around..

We love this place."}
{"text":"Greek food doesn't get better in Toronto. This is where the Greeks eat. Great service and great food on each of the 10 times I have eaten here."}
{"text":"Meh. Was pretty excited about the meal given the reviews of 'ultimate calamari' but it was just okay. Healthy portions of calamari, but light on the salad. $7 for hummus that doesn't include pita (extra $2). Really nice staff. Awesome honey cake, but not enough to return for a meal."}
{"text":"Ordered the large dip with octopus and gigantes (type of bean) and the drip was super yummy but I didn't enjoy the octopus or gigantes much, the Saganaki (flambleed cheese) which was excellent, lamb souvlaki, pork souvlaki and grilled lamb which was all super yummy and big portions.

The service was alright - I mean, it wasn't bad but there were periods of time where it seems like the owner (I think) didn't want to serve us even though he came up to us to take our order.

Overall, I'd come back. Food is awesomeeeee."}
{"text":"Great food, even small portion is enough, a little bit noisy. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place to get Greek food.  They have an amazing Shrimp Saganaki....worth going to this place just for that.  Gracious staff who have worked there for decades and truly care about your dining experience.  Sometimes they bring you a complimentary dessert which really is the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place where you can be blissfully ignored, then come here.

If you're looking for a place where you can be served the wrong dish and your waiter never come back to the table to replace it/acknowledge the fact/apologize, then come here.

If you're looking for a place with no ice box for your white wine, then come here. Let it warm up as you fail to get served.

If you're looking for a place where you can grossly overpay for your food, then come here.

There are plenty of places in the neighbourhood that will only be too happy to have your business. I recommend shopping around. Used to be a fan but no more."}
{"text":"Great Greek! Their menu features an excellent assortment of Greek favourites, including a decent selection of vegetarian options. The service was friendly, efficient, and attentive. Their large dining room never feels crowded and allows for comfortable conversation. Pantheon is now our go to place on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for the best Greek food in Toronto. Thanks to Yelp I found Pantheon.  I went around 330pm so it was dead, I am pretty sure we were the only ones in the restaurant. I really got the family restaurant vibe from the place. Our server was a little rough around the edges but his service was amazing.  Highlights- calamari- amazing, spanakopita- amazing...also had the lamb souvlaki, shrimp in cheese and garlic sauce and the baklava. all very good

Repeat- definitely"}
{"text":"The food here was outstanding, very healthy size portions. I was completely stuffed by the conclusion of my meal.  Not to name the food tasted great.  The service was exceptional also.   I will be back again in the near future."}
{"text":"- this place is legit (based on me being extremely non-greek)....
- had the grilled calamari dinner and the lamb souvlaki. and dang. that was phenomenal. 
- the calamari is most def the one thing you must have here. (so says me, and our waiter bobby)
- they have something called beeftekia on the menu (ground beef marinated in spices and greek beer)... that is also on the kids menu! beer and kids. win.
- will definitely come back. 
- p.s. you get 500 extra aeroplan points for eating here while paying with an aeroplan visa"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. I thought being in Greek town we would be super delighted but we're disappointed.  The pita was way below average along with the humus.  The portions sizes are good and the meal is not horrible just was expecting something excellent and did not receive that."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious. Hummus, cheese and caviar .... Chicken Slovakia .... Greek salad. .... All were amazing.  The waiter was wonderful and gave us a free honey cake for dessert.  I can't wait for the next visit."}
{"text":"We ordered the Seafood pasta and sautéed shrimps over Greek salad with a dip platter. 
The food was great and specially the dip platter which was just amazing. The salad served with the seafood pasta was delicious. The service was prompt. Try the Hellenic Greek Beer when u eat here. Overall very friendly and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"mediocreon

I don't 'go to The Danfort often enough.  I really should.  There's so much love in Greek food - you have savoury souvlaki, flaky and gooey spanakopita, and cheese flamed with cognac (a personal favourite).  Greek food was my favourite cuisine between 1996 and 1998.  Of course my mother seems to think it still is.   I don't fault her, it's us daughters, we change our minds so often.

Twenty of us gathered for a birthday dinner on Tuesday and were seated in their \"semi-private\" room with fireplace.  Yes, the fireplace is indeed one of their selling points.  

Pantheon is exactly what a family owned restaurant feels like; it even has grumpy grandpa, who, unfortunately, served our table.  Crotchety.  Not exactly the appetizer I wanted for my meal.

Moving on, the general consensus was that the main dishes were baseline good, barely.  

The garides saganaki appetizer I had was delicious.  But how can you screw up garlic butter sautéed shrimp melted in cheese?  Really, you can't.

The salad that came with the souvlaki dinners wasn't spectacular but it was very fresh.  

I ordered the small Pork Souvlaki dinner (small seemed to fill most of us up, girls and guys alike), but I got chicken.  There were 20 of us and it was hectic so I decided to be agreeable and just ate it.

Nothing on my plate tasted any better than the Jimmy the Greek I used to eat at the Eaton Centre.  It wasn't as greasy, but I'm not convinced that Pantheon deserves the accoldes I've seen and heard - \"best Greek in Toronto\".  Those are fighting words and necessarily need to be backed up by knock-me-off-my-feet food.

Oh look, I'm still standing.  (Hehe)

Pantheon did have one saving grace, its tzatziki.  One of the best I've had and it made my night.  The taste just pops and your entire mouth fills with creamy cucumbery garlicky goodness.  I've always thought the best tzatziki should zing."}
{"text":"We come here for special dinners when we are feeling for Greek food with a family style atmosphere. The service is really great!! There are so many servers around to respond to your needs. 

The food is classic Greek fare, and the portions are pretty generous. My partner and had two appetizers and shared one large chick Souvlaki  dinner and we were very satisfied. 

I highly recommend this Greek restaurant when there are so many choices in the area."}
{"text":"Listen, I love this place. I love it. Fantastic wine. Food is always impeccable (try the village salad). Ive been coming here for years and i am going to keep coming. The saganaki (sp?) is amazing too."}
{"text":"The line up on here on a Saturday evening is like being in clubland but for older people so make a reservation!
The food was pretty good and at a decent price. Good options for vegetarians but it's the service that makes this place great! Bring a friend here for their birthday and embarrass the hell out of them by getting the staff to sing \"happy birthday\" to them. The man who sang to my friend couldn't carry a tune if his life depended on it but the enthusiasm and flailing arms made it one of the best renditions of \"happy birthday\" I've ever witnessed."}
{"text":"We checked out Pantheon earlier this week and loved the calamari. The souvlaki was good too but didn't blow my mind. And the honey cake is to die for. The wait staff is a little surly but the calamari makes up for everything - it is one of my favorite dishes ever."}
{"text":"Get the shrimp saganaki - trust me. Everything on the menu is fresh and delicious. And if you want an entertaining end to your night, tell them it's your birthday.

Hands down the Greek restaurant on the Danforth."}
{"text":"before this place I've always felt a bit iffy about Greek food. i thought it was a bit too blend n not enough meat for my liking, but this place changed the way i view Greek food! everything is flavourful, fresh n delish! i was very satisfied!
Love this place! food is great n not too pricey! big portions!
 
1st time trying Saganaki ( fried cheese?) n it was great! not sure what kind of cheese it was but it string like mozzarella, its salty, n they grilled or fried it so it was crispy on the outside....when they bring it to ur table they set the thing on fire while shouting \"OPAAaa!!\"  it was interesting i guess...

n we also got a mix dip platter...way too much for 3 people, but all were really yummy!( there was a garlic one, a hummus, n eggplant dip...n i think 2 more hummus type dips...can't remember) wish it came with more pita for dipping, but dun have to stomach for all that food, wut a waste... :P i think that thing is good for 5~6 people...just ask for more pita!
for main, we got the chicken souvlaki dinner, i know is kinda a typical thing to get....but bf loves it so we got it! n it was also awesome n great! the chicken was very tender, rice was well seasoned n so was the potatoes. not mind blowing but was simple n good. wish we got more chicken tho...
I got the grilled calamari , it's one of the best I've ever had!! it was fresh, tender n not rubbery at all! grilled to perfection! n they r really generous too! the calamari dinner is about  $15ish n u get not 1, not 2, but 3 whole squid!! that's right, 3!! ( i sound like a infomercial lol)
gave bf a entire one n still was so full! oh, n btw all dinners comes with a simple Greek salad! 
want to try their fish n fried calamari next time...

we got a free big slice of cake at the end of dinner, it was good but we were so full, n it was a bit too sweet for us, woulda been perfect with a cup of black coffee....mmmm

if there is anything negative i can say about the place is that, the staff are kinda cold, or maybe their English is not so good? whatever it is they don't really respond or talk to you much, so you are not sure if they got you.....leave you feeling worry they heard you or not...
but they get the job done. 
oh n my wine glass was chipped...( whenever that happens i wonder where the piece of chipped glass had went....*gulp*)

overall i had a great dinner! casual relaxed, yummy, good portion, my kinda place to eat!
bf n i made this our go to Greek place!"}
{"text":"Best chicken and lamb souvlaki and grilled calamari we've had hands down...so juicy and flavorful. It was even better than the food we ate in Santorini last year. The restaurant is cozy and feels like we were back in Greece. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"I am in love with their signature salad, which is comprised of chopped romaine, green onion, tomato, dill, olives and olives oil.  It tastes so fresh and flavourful and the thinly chopped greens really pick up the dressing nicely.  I am not a huge fan of dill but it really works here.  I also had the hummus dip which came with 2 grilled pita.  

The restaurant is lovely and bright.  Service is very warm and attentive.  The waiters are very enthusiastic when serving and flambeeing the saganaki.  We heard OPA followed by applause quite a few times during our lunch.

Note to vegetarians:  The gigante beans are cooked in chicken stock.  Probably same for rice and potatoes.

Accessiblity:  Not really.  There are 2 levels for seating and washrooms are in the basement. And possibly a step at the entrance."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner here yesterday and was pleasantly pleased with almost everything!

Our server Bobby was great. Gave us lots of time to chat before taking our order and never once did we feel rushed with our meal.

We ordered the fried calamari and my lord was it every tasty! Perfectly crisp on the outside and wonderfully tender on the inside. 

I got the pork soulaki dinner and the pork was absolutely spot on. I was however disappointed in the potatoes and the rice. The rice was overly mushy and had too much lemon juice. 

Bobby ended our meal by bringing us honey cake which was the prefect thing.

We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place hAs the best Greek food on greektown in my book. I went there with my bf for our anniversary and it was very cozy and romantic. The price was fair for the food amount and drinks we had and the service was very quick and kind."}
{"text":"Went here today for the Taste of the Danforth & the Mousakka was amazing! I have heard nothing but excellent things from here and it was great to experience this on my first journey for the Danforth Festival. 

My friend had the Pork Souvlaki and that was given to her in a most GENEROUS portion lol.

Definitely will be returning here again, the service was fast and friendly and the food was tasty & excellent. Some of the best Greek food i've ever had"}
{"text":"Lots of 4 and 5 star reviews and I won't go against the grain. This place was recommended by a Greek colleague so he knows what he's talking about. 

The place is super old school with murals of the Greek gods and maps of Greece. Like the place you went to back in the day for giant Souvlaki and pieces of Baklava. 

My girlfriend and I split the $40 appetizer plate which includes calamari ( we got fried, not grilled) , octopus, dolmades, Greek sausage , spaniokopita and roast potatoes. We finished the whole plate. No leftovers here. 

We were kinda surprised the waiter kept offering us cake. We didn't know it was free! Next time. 

I'd come back, maybe with a big group so you can get lots of appetizers and the flaming cheese!"}
{"text":"First time at this place today dining with my mother, grandmother, and 4yo son. We were SO impressed by the staff as well as the owner. Our server Bobby was extremely warm and friendly and immediately helped us with our stroller and was very patient with my elderly grandmother. The owner took the time to ask us how our meals were and brought us two desserts on the house after we had finished.

The food was really good - especially the spanokopita which was the best I've had next to homemade by my friend's Greek mother. It was really a standout - savoury and fresh with the perfect amounts of dill, feta, and spinach. The saganaki was also great, and my son was wowed by the flames.

One of the pieces of chicken in my brochette was underdone, which is really off-putting with chicken, but everything else was so delicious and the service was so exceptionally warm and friendly that I couldn't possibly knock a star off for that.

I'm so excited, after decades of eating out in Toronto, to finally have found our go-to Greek spot, and we intend to be loyal customers for years to come. We don't live in the neighbourhood but I look forward to making the trip to the east end to enjoy more of the well-priced, delicious food and amazingly welcoming service. This place totally made our day - what a difference kindness and genuine hospitality makes!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Pantheon since I was a kid. I love the fact that this is authentic Greek cuisine. I have been to Greece over ten times to visit family and this is one of the few places here in Canada where it really feels like you are in the old country enjoying the Greek flavour. The decor is nothing special. It's no frills, unpretentious and I wouldn't change that at all about it. There is always a line up out the door (even in the dead of winter...trust me....I've been there) and that says a lot about a restaurant. Take it from a Greek...this food is something to say OPA about. Yum!

P.S. They even had a wine on their menu that comes from the small town where my father is from. Bonus marks!!!"}
{"text":"BLACKMAGIC!  How else can you explain how EVERYTHING was cooked to perfection! 

We ordered the grill mix to share and we still had leftovers! If you have 4 people just order the dinner for 2 because there's so much food. On second thought order the 4 full meals and have yummy leftover for the whole week! Yummy Greek food! 

The grill mix featured the chicken, lamb, and sausage. Lamb was flavorful and juicy as well as the sausage. The chicken was the ultimate test, usually it's dry but not this one. It was nice and juicy! Absolutely BLACKMAGIC! 

Waiter and owner was very friendly and nice and we got the sugar cake comp! They know how to make you feel appreciated. Many restaurants can take cues from this place. 

This is the last of few good family restaurants in the place. If you are in the area going here is a no brainer."}
{"text":"A couple friends and I decided to have dinner here. We'd heard about their grilled calamari and wanted give it try. The hostess was very welcoming when I walked in and when I asked to be seated on the patio I was easily accommodated. We had reservations and I would highly recommend it as the place fills up quickly. 

We ordered the Hot combo for two and the housemade hummus dip with Pita bread. I was glad to hear from our server that most of their items are made in house and from scratch. The hot combo offered a little bit of everything - calamari, octopus, grilled sausage, dolmadakia and spanakopita. The food arrived promptly and everything was absolutely delicious. The grilled calamari was the shining star. It was tender, grilled to perfection, and practically melted in your mouth. I would absolutely recommend you try it!  I found the portions to be generous and well worth the price. They end the meal by serving you a complimentary piece of their honey cake which is a perfect finale to a lovely Greek meal.  

The ambience was boisterous and inviting. Everyone really seemed to enjoy working there and that added to the customer experience. 

If it's your first time here definitely try their grilled calamari, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After living in Riverdale for 20 odd years, finally made it to Pantheon. 
The waiter was prompt and when we couldn't decide what to get for an appetizer,
he said, don't worry, let me bring you my favorite dips. He brought us a plate with 3 dips, and some warm lovely pita bread. 
We both had a small greek salad an chicken souvlaki dinner. Chicken was cooked to perfection, 
The free honey cake at the end of this terrific meal was a nice surprise. 
This is our new favorite greek restaurant on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, super friendly staff and most importantly (for someone like me) the food was out of this world.. As appetizer we ordered their famous saganaki.. Wow.. They also treated us to a free dip sampler that was amazing! The spicy cheese on it was the best..
We tried the Jumbo shrimp risotto with melted saganaki.. I literally stopped engaging in any conversation with my party just to savor every bite.. And another main dish ordered was the lamb with veggies on the side ( I don't eat lamb) but my husband who is a lamb connaisseur had nothing but good feedback on it.. And then came their complimentary honey cake.. I had just one bite because I was about to explode, it's really good but nothing fancy!"}
{"text":"Excellent tapas! Large portions and some of the best saganaki you'll find on the Danforth! Service is exceptional."}
{"text":"If you want to get a really decently grilled fish that is fresh, this is the place to come . It is not pretentious, it is not cheap, but it is good value particularly in the fish department! (I find it difficult to encounter a good fish in Toronto ) . 
Otherwise, there are plenty of normal Greek dishes available."}
{"text":"There is no better Greek restaurant on the Danforth! I've been going here for years and have never had a bad experience! 

The ingredients are top quality: the dips have an authentic taste, the meats melt in your mouth and the seafood as great as any I've had seaside at Greek island tavernas!  

You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Best dining experience I've had in Toronto. The food is amazing, the service is fantastic. This is easily my favorite restaurant in Toronto. 

I've never had a bad meal or experience. The waiters are frequently re-filling your water or wine before its half empty. The provide complimentary bread, and occasionally offer free appetizers and/or dessert to share. 

If you're there for your birthday you'll get serenaded by one of the three tenors ;-) Honestly if you're looking for great Greek experience - I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Perfect yummy garlicky tasty lunch.  Big portions that we enjoyed later that night night takeaway.  Good service. Tacky decor.  We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after seeing the recommendations here.  So I ordered a Greek salad with chicken and tzatziki on the side.   The salad was nice, but the only olive I got was the one that came with the tzatziki plate -- there were none on the salad.  And checking the Wikipedia definition of Greek salad, olives should be part of it, as well as cucumbers, of which I saw none as well.   The salad consisted of lettuce, carrots, celery, red cabbage, and red onions.   There was a lineup on Sunday evening to get a patio table, which didn't affect me since I was sitting inside.   The atmosphere was enhanced by the Greek mythology posters on the walls."}
{"text":"There was a slight line on a Friday night, but I didn't realize that the restaurant also has the space next door, so we ended up waiting just a few minutes for a table. Seems to be a neighborhood favorite. The saganaki was awesome! The chicken souvlaki was good, juicy and tender, not burned to a crisp like others in the area. Service was quick, but I never felt rushed."}
{"text":"Being Greek myself, it is hard to say that this place is the best because my mother would kill me...but it's awesome!

I would stay away from the boring dinner plate option that offers rice and salad with the meal and go family-style, ordering the horiatiki salad, calamari (fried or grilled), taramosalata and ordering your choice of grilled meats (ALL SO GOOD)!

By the end of the meal you will be too full but order the honey walnut cake anyway with a greek coffee, you won't regret it!

(p.s. Don't tell my mom)"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for a long time because they have fantastic food and great servers.  I have had everything on the menu and they are all textbook excellent.  My most favourite is the lamb chops.  Dear goodness why is their lamb chops so tender, juicy and cooked to perfection?  I could eat that all day.  

But what makes this establishment especially outstanding for me is that they went out of their way to fulfill my request.  It is hard to park along Danforth on a Saturday night so I ordered take out and requested them to bring out my order outside while I double park along Danforth.  Highly unusual but not only did they comply but they took pains to make sure that I got my order and made payment by credit card easy.  They ran out twice to have me sign the slip and then to give me the receipt.  All of this transpired with a smile and a slight apology.  That struck me as great customer service where I felt special and they really went beyond my expectations."}
{"text":"Excellent food, generally attentive service. We forgot to order the flaming cheese, but will do so when we go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come here twice - the first time we were happy with the food but found service to be poor despite the raving reviews. Last night I decided I wanted us to try it again and I'm so glad we did. We got there around 9:30pm and it was packed and busy, we were quickly attended to and ordered the fresh fish; sea bass for me and red snapper for him and a side stick of chicken souvlaki. The fish came with greek salads, rice, potatoes and other veggies. While we waited we had our salads (so good!) and had a complimentary dip which was nice. 

Our food came and it was AMAZING. Some of the best grilled fish we have both ever had, it was fresh, well seasoned and just delicious. Our waiter even offered to debone mine which was very kind and helpful. We got complimentary dessert in the end that was a nice touch to end our meal. The portions, quality, and flavors make Pantheon my new favorite Greek restaurant and I can now understand why it is for so many others as well. 

The service we also received last night was impeccable - our servers were caring and attentive. Pantheon feels close and intimate and makes me feel like I'm already in Greece.. if you haven't made your way here yet I highly recommend you do so. We will most definitely returning again and again."}
{"text":"I used to live in Greektown, and this was my favourite place.

Grilled calamari (which I don't even like) is tender and lemony, and the dolmades are a buttery, delicious reproach to every restaurant that serves them out of a jar.  The sausage appetiser could feed your entire family, and the big salads are to die for.  

I rarely make it as far as the mains because the appetisers are so good, but I've learned to save space for the dripping honey cake (if the evening's getting on, they might bring a serving gratis).  Wash it down with a Mythos and look at the pleasingly lurid murals of the Greek gods.  See the waiters set dishes alight.  At Pantheon, they do it right."}
{"text":"Its been a long time since I've been in Greektown, so there aren't many restaurants that I know in the area. There were so many patios and the like, it really is an amazing part of town. 

Decided to try this restaurant. Since the patio was full, we dined in. The service there was excellent. The saganaki was amazing. The only downfall to this restaurant occurred at the end of the meal. I guess my server was a little bit too busy, and another server came by to help him. This second server wasn't very good. Not sure if she was tired or whatnot. 

Overall, a very good experience. I would recommend it and go back if I'm in the area. Hopefully, I can try the patio. 

Pros: 

Excellent service (but not consistent)
Excellent food. The lamb was a little bit over cooked. Will order medium rare next time. 
Portions were large

Con

Last waitress was not very good."}
{"text":"Ordered the grilled calamari on salad. The calamari was very very good. Salad had a nice flavour too. There was sooo much calamari (which is awesome), but in terms of my personal preference, I think it would've been nice to share the dish with someone, and try a different item on the menu as well. I like calamari, but do prefer more variety in my meal! 

Complimentary bread basket and honey cake. I wasn't a fan of the bread. The honey cake was alright - very sweet and syrupy. Too sweet for my liking, but hey, it's honey cake so it's supposed to be sweet!

Resto is a bit on the pricier side, but they do their seafood dishes well. Also, very spacious inside the restaurant, with lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were here to celebrate Lauren M's 400th Review!!  

So with that.. I'll defer to her review.  But the place was excellent!  The complimentary cake pushed it over the top and bought an extra star.

{"text":"This was our first Greek on Danforth experience and it didn't disappoint! 

The GOOD:
- The environment. Servers and staff are bustling around, food is flying out of the kitchen and you feel like you are seated in a friend's home. Comparable to Mama Martinos on Queensway. 
- The portions. The prices initially scared me but you definitely get your money's worth in food. 

The not so BAD:
- Don't expect 5 star service. Servers are prompt and direct. 

The HEAVY:
- The cheesy shrimp. I forgot the name of the dish but there was a lot of cheese and oil on my plate. Yum!?"}
{"text":"Great place. Such an attentive service and good food. I strongly recommend for any occasion. Bobby is a superstar."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend of mine here and I was definitely blown away! I had the grilled calamari (three huge ones!) and it was definitely the freshest calamari that I've ever had considering Toronto isn't exactly right by the ocean. The owner and staff were very friendly and were genuinely attentive. They get 10/10 from me! 

Actually, make that 100/10 for the complimentary honey cake for dessert!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times and each experience has been great. The service is excellent and waiting staff are very attentive...we were encouraged to take our time. The lamb souvlaki is delicious as is the grilled calamari. Portions are big...be prepared! Both times we have had complimentary desserts and last time some ice wine at the end of our meal. 

I really need to try some other places on the Danforth but I'm struggling to see past Pantheon!"}
{"text":"Good portion sizes, delicious food, quick service. order the saganaki flambé cheese, you get an entertaining \"Opa!\""}
{"text":"I loved Pantheon for its authentically good food and service. The Greek waiter worked real hard to please a dining room full of people just like in Greece. The souvlaki and ravani honey cake were the best I've had. I wished I had more room to order more! As a first time visitor to Toronto, I loved the city and of course Greektown."}
{"text":"My go to place on the Danforth when I'm craving grilled calamari didn't disappoint!

We ordered the calamari dinner that comes with three generous pieces and the market prices sea bass dinner. Both were delicious and at a great price point. 

Always get great service and good value including the complimentary honey cake!

Five star if they ever renovate and refresh the washrooms!!"}
{"text":"My dad and I tried this place out today and it was amazing. Great service and delicious food. Half way into our lunch we immediately planned on coming back!"}
{"text":"Still the best.. Went on weekend and had octopus over Pantheon Salad.. Incredible!!!
Grilled Calamari is so good!!! And now my 8 year old loves their fried calamari so way less for me now :("}
{"text":"I'm not one to eat and leave a restaurant. I absolutely love taking my time and nursing a few drinks. I rarely sit down to have a mindful meal during the week so when I do, I like to enjoy it. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of this place. Our waiter, who should have been retired, was miserable. He was rude and bothered by our company and we were nothing but kind to him. He got a few orders wrong and then blamed us because we 'told him' that.The only reason this place is getting a 3 star was because the food was amazing. I'd go back for sure but my first impression wasn't great, he really did ruin the experience for us."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for 3 days and this place was so good I ate here twice! Loved the fresh taste of the grilled meats and my husband loved the grape leaves. Service was attentive and on point!"}
{"text":"As far as Greek food on the Danforth goes, Pantheon is pretty good.  I can't get too enthusiastic since no one item really wow'ed me or anyone in our dining party, but everything was solid across the board.

Highlights were:

- Grilled Calamari - three pretty large well-seasoned squid perfectly cooked (nice and charred, but neither rubbery nor undercooked)
- The Roasted Potatoes were universally adored (a notch above the other Greek places we've been to along this stretch, and that's saying something since the roasted potatoes at the other places were all pretty good, too), these ones were particularly well-sized to provide a balance between deliciously-spiced surface area and substance
- We had the large Pikilia plate of dips, with extra bowls of beans and Marinated Octopus - all delicious, especially the Taramasalata which was smooth as silk.
- And we all seemed to have a craving for good Kalamata Olives, which were not a disappointment.
- Various Souvlaki meats were ordered around the table, and without exception, they were comprised of good sized hunks of quality meat (the lamb was a bit overdone, with just a tiny bit of pink, but it was surprisingly juicy nonetheless)

The service was excellent - the waitstaff friendly yet professional, and the salads came out faster than you could blink!  Again, these weren't mind-blowing, but still tasty and well-portioned.  And for our table of 7, they brought out two complimentary slices of honey-soaked cake drizzled in chocolate sauce - we were too full to finish those off (they were BIG slices), but what we had was a wonderful finish to a very satisfying meal.

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"In 36 years of my life I have only been to the Danforth like 3 or 4 times for Greek food.  I know I know i'm living under a rock but the thing is by the time I drive over an hour to get there I have passed like 50 Greek restaurants.  Well this past weekend I took the plunge and decided to go to the Danforth for dinner after an event I was at in downtown Toronto.  We were a small group and one of the people with us was Greek so I said I wanted her to choose a place that she thought was the best Greek food she has had.  Well Pantheon was one of her top 2 places.  Arrived around 8pm to find a line up out the door so that was already a turn off for me but the line moved fast and we were sitting in 15mins.  This place was PACKKED and man was I starving lol.  We started off with some apps.  Fried Calamari and Saganaki.  Calamari were excellent crispy, tasty, nice size portion and the rings were huge.  Saganaki was very tasty as well.  For my entrée I had the pork Souvlaki dinner.  Now in most Greek restaurants I find that the pork can get dry.  The pork at Pantheon was super tasty and so tender.  Probably the most tender pork I have ever had.  By far Pantheon has to be one of the best Greek restaurants I have ever eaten at.  5 stars plus if I could.  Might just make me a frequent of the Danforth lol."}
{"text":"I say this is definitely a 4 star. The best part of this restaurant the waiter and waitress are friendly and helpful even they are not your server. The waiter took his time to show my wife the fish that she will order at a busy time. I order the lamb chop medium but was a little over. The fish was really good. Free desert. Yes you should try this !"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent personable service from Bobby!

The souvlaki was flavorful, the French fries were extra crispy and the tzaziki was to die for. 

We had a fried cheese appetizer, I forget the name but it was tasty and great for sharing. 

To top it off,  a piece of honey cake was delicious and hit the spot! 

Only downfall was I found it a bit pricey, especially for apps but I think it was worth it for the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant numerous times in the past few years and the service is always great! The food is delicious - I love their potatoes and souvlaki. It's a family owned restaurant which gives it charm. The free cake at the end of the meal is a good bonus!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Pantheon for years; very rarely do they disappoint. The atmosphere is lively, the waiters are courteous and friendly and there's always flaming cheese (cheese saganaki) and shouts of \"opa!\" in the background. Plus, if it's your birthday, the waiters will bring out a generous slice of honey cake at the end (with a candle, of course) and belt out a loud, unabashed version of \"happy birthday\"!

Although the souvlaki are excellent (I've had the pork and chicken; both moist), my usual order is the grilled calamari dinner ($19.95). It comes with 3 large pieces of calamari, 2 tentacle \"bunches\", potatoes, carrots and broccoli. The portion sizes are sooooooo generous - I guarantee that you won't leave hungry. The calamari was super tender and seasoned very well; a squirt of lemon on top just seals the deal. 

At the end of every meal, they will give your table a complimentary slice of their honey cake. Even though I'm full after the calamari, it's like I have a separate stomach for the cake (funny, how that works).

TLDR: one of, if not, the best family style Greek restaurants on the Danforth."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Greek food. It's amazing and Pantheon is a great choice! We have been there on numerous occasions for group celebrations. I love it!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a great Greek feast here with two friends who introduced me to the gems of this cuisine. We ordered a bunch of platters and dips and enjoyed a bottle of great greek wine. My friend told me it was from a small village her grandfather came from. The food and wine were a great match and the service courteous. I have to say a lot of credit for this delicious culinary experience goes to my friends who gave me a lesson on what was authentic, but they said this was their favourite Greek restaurant in town and they found it to be very consistent and the menu had dishes not easily found elsewhere. My favourite were saganaki, the friend cheese, the roasted potatoes done with cheese and the spicy feta dip served with their salad. Our bill was 50 each before tips, but we felt it was fair for this culinary odyssey! I now know Greek cuisine is not just spanakopita and souvlaki. We chose to have dessert in Athens bakery which is a block away. I will be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"So good. Visiting from Rochester and chose this place based on Yelp reviews. We ordered five appetizers. All five could have been meals, the portions were so generous. The grilled calamari was outstanding, very meaty and delicious. But my favorite was the chicken livers. Well prepared and so tasty. My only mistake was ordering a salad first. Thought I might be hungry! Ha!  I would certainly come back to the Pantheon. Our waiter Bobby was terrific and fun. A great find in Greektown."}
{"text":"The choice of the place was really accidental, but this was a good accident. 

The food is as close to authentic Greek as it gets, the service is excellent and with a smile, and getting desert on the house always wins points in my book :)

Will definitely repeat - really want to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Every time I come here at the Danforth I go to Messini.  This time I decided to try something new and I ended up here at this restaurant.  The restaurant is fairly large inside and can accommodate large groups of parties which is convenient. I ordered the calamari the cheese flaming thingy and also a chicken pita with fries.  The calamari was grilled perfectly and I finished the cheese flaming thingy and the chicken from the pita was one of the most tender I have ever had at a Greek restaurant.  Service is fast and friendly and I recommend anyone to try this Greek restaurant out on the Danforth.  Yes I would come here again."}
{"text":"Great old school traditional Greek tavernas style spot. Apps are generous portions meant for sharing.  Price point for quantity taste makes this a really good value  (the lower side of $$ in my view)
The house red wine is a nice affordable wine that both stands up to the food but is easy going enough to enjoy on its own.

Nice bread with butter, easy to change standard greek for village salad (my personal favorite) calamari was fantastic.  The dip with it was great.
The cod was fantastic but the side dip with this was a giant portion.  
The quail main with veg/roast potatoes was fantastic tasty well seasoned...and the vegetables were done just right...split between two people this was excellent.  Also none of the fried things were the least greasy and we really enjoyed the flavors. 
Dessert ordered baklava and they provide honey cake...yum!!! Also greek coffee..overall a fantastic experience with wonderful service too."}
{"text":"Been around for a long time, my parents had their first date here. The food is amazing and go here with my family at minimum 3 times a year."}
{"text":"As I prepare for an upcoming trip to Greece I find myself obsessing over Greek food, and last night I found myself on the Danforth with fellow Yelpers hoping to check out a new Greek food spot.  As luck would have it, someone in our group suggested Pantheon.

What a delight!  The restaurant has a real taverna feel complete with posters of Greek philosophers, gods, godesses and even a cheat-notes type poster describing Pythagorean's theory.  Overall, great points for decor.

The service was amazing.  Our server was super-friendly and attentive.  

The food, oh the food.  Absolutely delicious sharing platter replete with grilled calamari and octopus (both seasoned and grilled to perfection), stuffed grape leaves, giant Greek sausage, spanokopita and fresh slices of cucumber and tomato.  We also ordered a plate of tzazkiki (well worth every single calorie).

Our server also brought us a free slice of honey cake, which although it didn't look like much, was out of this world delcious.

The price was very reasonable and no one left hungry.

Love, love, loved this place!"}
{"text":"So great! I came here with my bestie and we had a great time. Our server was amazing and kept dancing and singing (while opening wine, while bringing out food, etc). The saganaki was soooo so good and we split a spanakopita dinner which was a good call, it came with 2 spanakopitas! We also got a bottle of wine for under $30 AND free dessert! Great place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My BF and I had a craving for Greek food late last night and decided to give Pantheon a shot. I am so glad that we did :) The service was super friendly and everything tasted very fresh. It was not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination, just honest, tasty food.

We had the tyrokafteri (spicy feta) dip and it was awesome! Very smooth and creamy, with a hint of spice, served with bread or pita.

Also tried the spanakopita as well, which was super hot with crispy, flaky phyllo dough. I am frequently disappointed by soggy variations of this dish but LOVED the spanakopita they offered here!!

Greek salad was very tasty, right amount of salty feta without being greasy and overdressed.

Since we were eating so late, we decided to spilt a large chicken souvlaki dinner. I am not joking, this was the BEST chicken souvlaki I have ever tried! It was juicy and flavourful and all white meat. MEGA YUM! Even the lemon potatoes, rice, and carrots served alongside were super!

To end the meal (and we were seriously stuffed), we were given a complimentary slice of ravani (honey cake) drizzled in chocolate sauce and drenched in honey. Oh god, that was amazing and a very nice touch!! :)

This is for sure my new favourite Greek restaurant in Toronto. Check out if you need some tasty and reasonably priced food!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful atmosphere, so much to look at and is also very entertaining with one waiter. This old guy serves a flamed dish and does the most dramatic OPA you can possibly imagine. It is such a nice place and the hospitality is wonderful. Food was also amazing, big portions though so we got to take some home."}
{"text":"One of the best and most reliable Greek restaurants on the Danforth.  The environment is surrounded with somewhat kitsch murals of gods and goddesses, but eventually it becomes an endearing element.  I always come back here for their generous portion of grilled calamari.  The service is very friendly, sincere, warm and efficient. Overall a very positive experience."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.   Salad was over dressed.   Spanikopita was very greasy.  Fried calamari was soggy.  Meat was way overcooked.   Only thing they got right was the beer.

Astoria is way better, will not return."}
{"text":"Nice setting.  Tasty food. This fun restaurant on \"The Danforth\" is well worth a visit as a family or couple."}
{"text":"Great dining experience, great food, and exceptional friendly service. We had to leave another neighboring Greek resto because they couldn't get it together, so we came here. Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Great food - grilled calamari is a must. Service 2 stars, be prepared to be served by a grumpy old man."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Good and friendly customer service. We ordered the seafood platter. Presentation was nice. Food was ok.  Some pieces were too salty. Not much flavour. Greek salad was good. Kids liked the chicken fingers with french fries. Greek coffee was good. My favourite thing was the complementary honey cake, it was very moist and delicious."}
{"text":"I was raised by a mom who always bragged about Greece and greek food. I have tried almost every restaurant in this town. But something special about this place. Most importantly, their waiters are extremely, again extremely friendly. There is a guy with longer hair if you get him you are in luck. 
The way they present their Cheese plate is too funny yet entertaining. I love this place and this is my to go place if i crave greek food."}
{"text":"Don't get a chance to eat Greek that often so had to give it a try, headed up to Greektown, and this was the best reviewed restaurant.  Got there around 7p on a Sunday night, two groups in front of us, only a 10 minute way, so good time to go.

I had the lamb chops, wife went with the chicken souvlaki, with the fried calamari for appetizer.  Lamb was really good, don't order it cooked beyond medium.  Wife thought the souvlaki was nothing special, kind of boring.  Next time she would go with the seafood pasta.

Very interesting atmosphere.  Busy restaurant.  Lots of large noisy groups.  Service with a lot of character.  Everyone seems to get the honey cake dessert included which was very good.

Take cards or cash.  Dinner overall took a long time, 2 hours, so keep that in mind if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good greek family restaurant, that's the place to go in Toronto. It is my favourite ever ! Service is professional and caring. Food is terrific, with generous portions. 

My chicken and pork souvlakis were so good, and I was surprised that my Greek potatoes were not fried, but boiled ! Miam !

I certainly recommend to anyone who wants a Greek feast. And don't be shame to tell the waiter if you go there on your birthday. An old waiter will come to your table to sing ... Happy birthday !! Hilarious :)"}
{"text":"Expensive! Check your bill! Known to make mistakes! 

I went here for dinner recently before a show at Danforth Music Hall. I heard that it was one of the better places on the Danforth of dinner.

I go there and am greeted by a hostess eating a souvlaki pita, pretty unprofessional. She then takes us to a table which was OK. 

Our server comes, doesn't take our drink order, which thinking about it now I'm glad he didn't I'm sure the beer here is a rip-off. I just drank water. 

I order the pork souvlaki dinner, and me and my buddy got 2 appetizers the saganaki (fried cheese) and the calamari. I paid for the saganaki and my meal and my buddy paid for the calamari and his dinner. 

When I got the bill I had a feeling it was too high about $40.70 JUST for the two things, a SMALL souvlaki dinner and a saganaki. The souvlaki dinner was $16 and the saganaki $15. So ok $31 with tax about $35 I got ripped off for $5. I left the guy $45 (which I realize is low but the service wasn't phenomenal) I didn't realize until the next day that I was ripped off, I know it's a small amount but when you go out you assume the bill is completely accurate and you're not over paying for something. 

I was in a rush for a show I didn't have time to check the bill to see if it's accurate it could've been a mistake or they could be purposely tried to rip me off I don't know. 

While the food was decent being ripped off really turned me off the place."}
{"text":"My first experience of Greek in Toronto Greektown and it's still the best over all for a sit down meal of Greek food I have had. Their grilled squid is the best and freshest I have ever had."}
{"text":"One of the better Greek restaurants in Greektown. I've been to almost every single one so I can say that I do have some knowledge about the restaurants in this area.

The grilled kalamari is a must. As is the charcoaled octopus for an appetizer. For the main course, I wouldn't recommend getting anything that isn't Greek. I mean. Why come to a Greek restaurant and get american food like steaks? Seriously. Go to a steakhouse then. The fish of the day was fantastic and I highly recommend getting it. I am usually never a big fan of fish but I felt like giving it a shot and I was completely blown out of the water. The lamb souvlaki is also really good but I prefer the fish more. I'll prob be getting the fish of the day the next time I come back unless they run out."}
{"text":"horrible food and service, would never go back again. I've had better Greek food at foodcourts in a mall than this. Our waiter was very uptight and would get upset every time we ordered something (more beer and water) and at the end 15% gratitude was automatically added onto our bill which was not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a concert at the Danforth and decided to try Pantheon. Seemed to be fairly popular with good reviews.

I'm surprised that this restaurant even has 4 stars - the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the quail plate and my friend ordered the chicken plate. The meat was mostly dry and flavorless. The broccoli, carrots and potatoes were basically just boiled with no flavor. To top it off, each plate cost around $20 each. 

The interior decor is also a bit cheesy - the tables are nice enough but the walls have images of Greece with information and descriptions about different sights. The one thing this place has going is the service- the waiter was very friendly and helpful, genuinely wanted our experience to be good and was excited to recommend dishes. They also served a complimentary honey cake at the end which was decent. 

In short, way too expensive for mediocrity. Not worth trying - might be worth reading other reviews if I simply didn't order the right dish."}
{"text":"It was recommended by one of my Greek colleagues as authentic greek restaurant. Do not waste time and money on this one. If you ever been in Greece, you will LOL on the portions, service and the taste of the food. On top, they do not have variety of fish."}
{"text":"What a wonderful and authentic Greek experience!  First off our waiter Bobby, was absolutely fantastic, and al the staff were great and very helpful.  They all worked together like a family, and not once did we have an empty glass of water, or a plate that was empty sitting on the table, they were on it!  Then we get to the food... Everything was authentic, amazing, fresh, flavourful, and plentiful. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We (5 people) walked in this restaurant on a Sunday around 6pm. The hostess that was suppose to greet us was just sitting on a chair outside that entrance. She didn't seem like she was very happy or enthusiastic in greeting or welcoming us. When she lead us into the dining room, she felt like she was lost as in where to sit us, she lead us to one room then lead us back to the other side then sat us down.

Our server was an old man which had problems speaking loudly that some of us at the end of the table couldn't hear him at all. 

3 of us ordered entrees which came with a started greek salad. The salad came quick, well dressed with some feta cheese and 1 piece of olive on top. The tomato that was with the salad was fairly green and one piece had the top of the tomato which you couldn't eat.

We ordered:
- 10oz N.Y steak which was cooked to what we requested. It came with a side of 2 pieces of potatoes, 2 pieces of carrots and 3 pieces of broccoli
- Chicken Slovakia with a little side of rice mixed with a few nibbles of corn and a little carrot and broccoli
- Sauteed scallops with a greek salad, which the scallops were a little over cooked
- Grilled calamari with a greek salad, the calamari was surprisingly a bigger portion than I have expected
- Quail with 2 pieces of potatoes, 3 pieces of carrots and 3 pieces of broccoli. The quail was a bit over cooked where the meat inside was a bit dry than moist.

Overall the food was good and service was up to par. There were often a lot of bus boys (wearing black) that came to our table to fill up our waters and clear our table.

15% gratuity was automatically added to the bill, which I felt it didn't worth 15% because the server only came to our table 3 times. First to take our order, second to bring our food then the last time was to give us the bill."}
{"text":"This place have one of the best grilled calamari in town! The honey cake that comes at the end of your meal is also a nice surprise and a great way to finish your meal. 

Pantheon is a lovely warm Greek restaurant on the Danforth. Atmosphere is great, service is attentive and they are accommodating and offer to make substitutions."}
{"text":"I have to say that if I lived in Greektown in Toronto, I would be on a permanent diet due to the amazing food that is served up on Danforth.

Case in point, for our second greek dinner on our weekend trip to Toronto (our first was Messini's which was also great), we decided to try Pantheon.  With so many places to choose from on Danforth, what tipped the scales towards Pantheon was photo of the calamari on the Yelp web site.  Having had grilled (and stuffed) calamari in Greece years ago, I wanted to try it again.

FOOD

Two of us ordered calamari (Pantheon special) and it was delicious.. and plentiful.  (In the photos, they show two pieces of calamari and ours had three!).  We also tried their tzatziki as an appetizer and three others ordered the souvlaki.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and the portions were huge allowing leftovers which survived the trip back to Ottawa to be enjoyed the following night.

SERVICE

As we ordered takout, I can't comment on the service.  However, it was very busy in the restaurant on a Sunday evening so that is a good sign.

PARKING

The locals know this but if you are from out of town, parking on Danforth is extremely limited.  With soo many restaurants and shops, I can understand why so be advised that you may want to park on a side street and walk over.  (Though the side streets seems equally packed).

--

So would I return?  In a heartbeat.  The next time I head down to Toronto, I'd go out of my way to go to Greektown just for the food.   It really is amazing."}
{"text":"Our group of six all agreed that this was the best service we have ever received at a restaurant. The server (guy with the long hair) was just incredible. Besides the amazing service, the food and everything else was also really good. I highly recommend coming to this restaurant. 

P.s: it's funny that the highlight of my review is the server and not the (really yummy) food. That's how great the experience was."}
{"text":"Amazing quality in food!
The price for the food is average for the area but the size of the servings and the taste of the food are really good.

The decor is simple but homely.
Greek ambient music compliments the scenery and the taste of the food.
The service is quick and good.

A nice place to come with family or friends.
Highly recomendable!!

{"text":"One of my favourite greek restaurants in Toronto - must haves are: grilled calamari and saganaki. Also, the family run feel of the restaurant means you are usually well taken care of."}
{"text":"The lovely gentlemen waiters made this restaurant so cozy and nice. The conversed with us and made us feel right at home. 

We ordered the chicken souvlaki with potatoes and salad on the side, and the Ortykia (quail) dinner. Huge huge portions here and we could barely finish our meals. 
Chicken souvlaki - often times I find chicken over cooked and dry and therefore usually avoid ordering chicken souvlaki of any kind. Considering the reviews of this restaurant and how it's situated right in Greek town, we must give it a chance. We are glad that we did because the chicken was so ridiculously tender and moist, so much flavour. Absolutely loved it. 
Ortykia - The quails were tasty to the bone but a bit dry when it came to the white meat. I wonder if there is a more polite and quicker way to eat quail because it's such a small animal to begin with and the bones are small and numerous. Nonetheless, worth trying for sure. 

Would love to come back another dinner soon and try something else!"}
{"text":"Been coming for years and they never disappoint. The food is always savory and juicy and most days they will bring a complimentary appetizer with 3 dips and delicious honey cake for dessert. I can easily say this is the best Greek food I've ever tasted and likely is the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"[location] 5/5
It is located at Greek town, very closed to subway station.

[Service] 5/5
There are two groups of waiters, the first group is to fill your water, the second group for ordering and the eye-catching flaming cheese show!

[Food] 5/5
Grilled calamari is highly commended (but fried calamari actually tastes better). Mousaka is also a classic greek food to order

[Overall] 5/5
It is a great place for family or friends gathering. Delicious food with large potion. Of course the awesome flaming cheese show and the happy birthday song!"}
{"text":"I only have one slight complaint, but everything else was excellent!

My friends and I (group of 6) were originally trying to go to Mamakas Taverna on a Friday night and fortunately they were rammed lol.  Otherwise, we would not have ended up at Pantheon and I'm so glad we did!  Their menu was much more traditional with way more options.

We got seated right away upon arrival.  Perfect amount of time between drinks, taking orders and the food coming out.  We were given a complimentary 3 dip trio which consisted of the Taramosalata (red caviar with pureed bread and olive oil), Melitzanosalata (pureed eggplant with secret recipe) and humus.  I didn't try any of the dips but the rest of the group thought the caviar dip was the best out of all three.

We also ordered a horiatiki to share and this was delicious!  Almost just like how they make it in Greece, however; it could really do without the capers.  I had to make sure I didn't get any on my plate.  Feta was great.

I ordered the small pork souvlaki (which I think they gave me a large), the rest of the group ordered, chicken souvlaki, vlahikes patates (slices potatoes), Pikadiko Loukaniko (vegetables with sausage), spanakotiropita dinner and the bakaliaro skordalia (pan fried cod).  Everyone LOVED their food.  The chicken souvlaki was actually juicier than my pork souvlaki.  The vlahikes patates were so tasty.  My only complaint, as previously mentioned, was their tzatziki.  It had a bit too much dill (I think it was dill) in it.  It threw the true taste of tzaitziki off.  I couldn't even eat 1/3 of my meal because I overdosed on salad lol.  My leftovers lasted me lunch and dinner the next day.

The servers were so great!  Very friendly and attentive.  I also appreciate when Greek people actually work at an authentic Greek restaurant. Our waters were constantly filled without having to ask.  They also gave us complimentary honey cake to end our meal, which was just right.  Not too sweet and light on the stomach.

I will definitely return!  Much more options to choose from on the menu!  I gotta try the pork chops!"}
{"text":"They lost our reservation. But still sat us in about 10 minutes.  Seem to take reservations in an old, disheveled notebook by hand.

Had the Mixed grill platter which was a bit on the expensive side ($26) for the amount of meat you get, but the meat is top quality and you will enjoy the lamp, pork and the sausage, cooked well done, in authentic Greek style.

Had Ravani for desert which was scrumptious. 

Better come early or reserve as the place is very small and cramped.  The interior is nothing to rave about, but the outside patio is very nice in the summer."}
{"text":"I ate here and was still sad five hours later.

Yes, eating an exceptionally bad meal makes me sad. 

I came here for lunch and thought it would be amazing Greek food. I ordered the roast lamb. It was ordinary three veg with meat. The Greek salad was worse than I would purchase in a pre-made supermarket container. 

This cost $29 which was also a sad part. Even at lunch time when it was empty. 

I liked the atmosphere so I'm almost inclined to leave two stars. It has a lots of Greek art and history around the restaurant which I really liked. 

Because of the food and servers attitude I can't, in good conscience, give this more than one star. 

Read some other reviews, try it for yourself and let others know what you think.

Happy hunting"}
{"text":"This is still the best and most authentic Greek food on the Danforth. I have never been disappointed by the calamari, and even when trying new things like the pantheon shrimps!  If in doubt, you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I don't go down to The Danforth as often as I used to and there are a few favourite places along the strip but the explorer in me wanted to try somewhere different. Pantheon has a very good rating on Yelp and I trust my fellow reviewers.

Everything on the menu looked really good but I didn't see gyros, my favourite. No problem, lots of other choices. We looked around at other tables and everything looked and smelled good. Generous portions!

My friend and I settled on the Roast Lamb and Grilled Quails, with some red caviar to start. We agreed to share since we really had trouble narrowing it down to just these dishes.

The caviar was creamy and delicious, first time my friend was having it. The quail was really good, well seasoned. The lamb wasn't exactly what we were expecting although it matched the description on the menu. For some reason, we pictured in our minds, something on the bone, maybe with some grill marks. That's lamb chops! We ordered slow roasted lamb and that's exactly what we got. It tasted good! Even the potatoes and veggies had a lot of flavour.

We were presented with a complimentary dessert of honey cake. It was good but the texture was a little coarse for my liking and very sweet.

There was a bit of an old-school quality to our dining experience, with murals of Greek Gods and ruins on the walls, and furniture that seemed a little dated but it was also enjoyable. Good food."}
{"text":"The food here is high quality.  The prices are reasonable too.

The sea bass and snapper are very nicely done.  The dips are good too.  

The owners are super friendly too - tell them it's your first time and they will treat you super nice (if you have a beautiful date/partner at least, who tells them that!)  We got free dips at the start, and they offered a free desert too.  

Although, at least one of the waiters was a little strange, the first time I went.  I'm not kidding when I say he was very friendly, with very dilated eyes.  I think I was being served by a waiter high on coke to be honest.... no kidding.  No names will be mentioned."}
{"text":"I used Yelp to find this place, in fact it's the first time I've ever done a Yelp review because the food was absolutely atrocious.  So bad that I created an account just to share this, so others do not make the same mistake I did.

Service - English was definitely a second language (which is ok), and it was a distant second at that (less ok, you need to at least be able to communicate with someone more than confused nods).  When ordering a large greek salad plus an entree, the server should realize that the entree comes with a greek salad as well, and advise accordingly.

My entre - 2x spanikopita, 2 pieces of potato (about 1/4 ptotatoe total) and three pieces of steamed brocoli + a greek salad that was mostly iceberg lettuce.  Price was over 12 bucks.  Seriously.

My partners entree - she described her lamb as dry and inedible.

This was my only Greek dining experience other than Messinnis (which is awesome by the way - but I only ever seem to get sandwiches there), so needless to say, I'll be trying out other places very soon."}
{"text":"Oh so good...if you want authentic Greek cuisine, it doesn't get much closer than this! I mean it's pretty hard to fool a native Greeks in a restaurant in the heart of Greek Town! If your in the area, it's worth the visit for sure."}
{"text":"This is my go to place every weekend. Whether I'm with the kids or with the woman. It's always good times here. The service is warm and genuine. Consistently making delicious food. I always go for the grilled calamari. No other place makes it like they do."}
{"text":"love this place!
Always Great  service !  Perfectly cooked food!
Keep coming back for 2 years.
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Spacious restaurant on the Danforth. Came here because of the good reviews and it did not disappoint! I ordered the Beeftekia which canes with sides of Greek salad and vegetables. The Beeftekia was well cooked though I felt they overseasoned it with burnt garlic. The sides were good though and they even gave my date and I free beer and cake for dessert! I also really liked the decor and paintings on the wall depicting Greek mythology."}
{"text":"I at here with a group of 10. The food was great and the restaurant is really relaxed. I like how the food isn't just the usual souvlaki. There are other great options and a good menu spread for everyone. I was also here for a private function once and the service was great. Make sure to ask for a seat near the street."}
{"text":"What I have tried:
+ Lamb Souvlaki (5/5): we got medium rare lamb and it came with rice, potatoes and salad. The lamb tasted sooooo goood, it took me to the next level. I have tried quite a lot lamb dishes but I have to say the lamb here was soooo flavourful. Their rice and salad were very fresh and tasty as well
+ Grilled calamari on greek salad (4/5): The calamari was so fresh and had lots of flavours and spices but tbh it's not much different from other grilled calamari I have tried. The greek salad was pretty fresh. This dish is quite light, so if you're hungry I recommend you go for the full plate which has more calamari and rice 
- Portions were so big, you can totally be really full for just one dish
- Price was a bit on the pricey side but it was WORTH IT 
- Service was fast and very very friendly"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant since when I got here,
 years ago. ^^

You can always expect great service and good quality food.Price is decent and they give you a family style big portion. ^^

As it's been mentioned by other users, you may have luck to receive a free honey cake, sometime - and yes... They are soooooo Devilishly delicious, too! - 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me and my GF ordered souvlaki dinners ... one chicken and one pork.

1. Breads with little butters - always moist in the middle and crispy on the rim.....
Yes, I know they are just basic complementary food  but seen  so many restaurants with similar price range, serving dried pieces or tasteless breads... so I really loved this. 

2. Greek Salads - romaine lettuce, Tomatoes, Feta Cheese and tomatoes...
Again pretty stick to the basic dish  but it was the sauce that made me  obsessed.

Not to heavy and had right amount of sourness to balance the dish.
Me and my GF were about to lick the plates...... No. Really!!!!

3. Souvlakies  - We were arguing each other to decide which dish was better - between my pork and her chicken. they were both cooked at the right temp. 
Juicy and moist inside. she did not really like the rice (which I loved) but we both
agreed that they had great taste and MY OH MY~~  those potatoes on the side..... 
they were melting like the butter and seasoned perfectly. 

Overall, it was a great experience for us. 
relaxing atmosphere , great portion of foods
and I really can't wait to visit them, again."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not going to describe what's on the menu at this restaurant, you just gotta go and see for yourself. It was my first time too but I'm telling you gals and guys this place is the \"THE BOMB\" took the wife there she was impressed with the food, service and guest interaction from the staff. After dinner she held my hands looked into my eyes and that devilish grin came out with a slight pout in her lips she then asked me how fast I could get home . . . 'member the movie \"Gone In 60 Seconds\" with Nicholas Gage . . . I was in our bed in 60 seconds . . . Thanks Pantheon the seafood kicked in just as I predicted . . . (lol)"}
{"text":"After a day at the zoo, we decided to stop in Greektown for some dinner.  Best choice ever.  The wait staff was incredibly kind and provided amazing recommendations (the grill mix is a carnivores dream).  They even nailed the details on my daughters custom order.  When in Toronto, find this place."}
{"text":"I had a very bizarre experience at this restaurant. First, I must say I liked the food. It was a little on the greasy side, but it tasted great and was exactly what I was hoping to get from a Greek restaurant. The complimentary dessert was a nice touch too.

Where this restaurant loses stars is on the unfortunate behavior of one employee. I'm not sure if this employee was a waiter or a manager, but he put a damper on my experience by loudly and repeatedly yelling at a bus boy in front of all the customers. It was very shocking to me, and very unprofessional. That kind of thing should be dealt with in private. I felt horrible for the poor bus boy, being humiliated like that in front of a restaurant full of guests. At one point, the employee followed the bus boy around, clapping his hands and yelling at him to go faster. It was awful! 

I didn't want to give this restaurant one star because I did enjoy the food, and our waiter was a very sweet older gentleman who was perfectly lovely. But I was very unimpressed with the behavior of that employee, and I certainly hope it was dealt with appropriately."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Best calamari in town and great service. My water glass never went empty, service was quick, free bread and they gave us dessert. Authentic, Greek cuisine! Opa"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant on the Danforth. The food is outstanding. The service is excellent and if you want an amazing laugh, ask them to sing you happy birthday. The decor is quaint and fun to look at. (Read the walls if you are not Greek and you will learn a lot!) I can't stress again how amazing the food is. Try their taramasalata, saganaki and marinated octopus."}
{"text":"Came here with the brother this week.  

Excellent selection of Seafood.  Lots of meat for the Carnivores also!    

He ordered the lamb.  I ordered the grilled Calamari!  Both came with a greek salad.  Our dinners were super flavourful and awesome as to be expected.  As usual with Greek restaurants, they give you huge portions.  To finish it off the waiter brought out a piece of honey cake for us to share!  A great place to come back on the Danforth!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Greek food one night and brave the busy Danforth on a Friday night!  We did have to wait a while to get seated despite having multiple tables available but we had a really friendly guy as our server.  We had the pork skewers, calamari, the taramosalata and saganaki with garlic shrimp.  

The pork skewers accompanied rice & potatoes and that plate was amazing as the pork was quite tender.  The taramosalata was also delicious.  Calamari they allowed us to have half fried half grilled and both were quite delicious as well!  We were a bit disappointed that the sagnaki was not like the plain saganaki where it was lit up but the plate itself was delicious too.  

Overall, a wonderful experience and take on home styled Greek cooking.  Don't expect your plates to look fancy here but do expect to have a yummy experience."}
{"text":"We only started going to this restaurant a few months ago but have been back so many times.  The food is outstanding, especially the grilled calamari and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, they take reservations but we got a table without one although it was quite busy.

Our waiter was an older gentlemen who treated us to free dips and free dessert which was amazing.

Souvlaki played also came with a delicious Greek salad and free bread and butter for the table.

Grilled calamari salad came with two large squids.

Overall the service was very frequent and friendly, gave a very home-like vibe. Would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"We were looking to have Greek food so went on Yelp to see what the most popular one in Greek town was. Pantheon sat at the top and after trying their food I'm not surprised :)

There were a lot of servers in the restaurant, many of whom looked like jolly grandpa's!  We got the calamari for our app, and I wasn't very used to the Greek style of calamari so I found it a) hard to cut (lol..) and b) seasoning just tasted salty without much else. It was still yummy, just not spectacular

I was quite impressed with my entree though. The beeftekia was SO flavorful and the ground beef was baked to the perfect extent. The potatoes were flavoured well too but the three chunks of ground beef filled me up so much I only half half of the veggies. The roast lamb was delicious as well! It was the meat was legs and cooked so tender.. seasoning was great.  Makes me fall in love with Greek food :)"}
{"text":"So, we were in Toronto for the holidays, and something that Lee and I were really missing was a nice souvlaki dinner, something not incredibly fancy. We settled on this place after another spot that Lee and our other friend turned out to not be there anymore.

It was a bit of a tight squeeze getting all four of us (3 guys who are at least 6ft tall, and then me) into a table in this jam packed restaurant, but the service was really quite nice. Lee and I got souvlaki plates, Lee's brother got a giant Greek Salad, and our other friend got a dish that totally escapes me. 

The salads were really quite delicious, stacked with a ton of feta and olives, with a great dressing. Then, the souvlaki arrived, and Lee and I swapped a few pieces (one of us got chicken and one pork.) The pork was the better of the two, but they were both really nice, with a nice seasoning and cooked perfectly.

The wine list is pretty extensive, but we decided to order beers, which were nothing to write home about.

If you're in the Danforth area and hankering for great Greek food, come here!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out this place for a while . That being said I had my expectation quite high having read many good reviews of this place and always line ups dinner time.  Had plater for two that has grilled octopus , grilled calamari , sausages , spinach feta cheese pie, potatoes and stuffed vine rice wrap .  Also had a chicken souvlaki platter  well yes turned out it's too much food for two of us and I took a lot home . They also have a good selection of wines which is great .  I was impressed by how tender and juicy everything taste . Octopus and calamari grilled to perfection . And my last visit me and my friend had the lamb chop medium. It was succulent we were rave about it and it's good portion for two people to share there are 5 pieces .    The spinach pie I did liked a lot the first time I tried it the pastry was thin layer and plenty fillings , the only thing I didn't like is there is layer inside taste gummy and like doughy . And the flamed cheese I'm a crazy cheese lover  thing I didn't like is there is layer inside taste gummy and like doughy . And the flamed cheese I'm a crazy cheese lover but I was not fond of this dish is really salty and rather greasy so not a good idea to have it with lots of meat . Good for show \" woo pa \" lol ."}
{"text":"My date and I came here for dinner on a mid-week evening. I ordered the light dinner with grilled calamari and he ordered the quail. The calamari was very good, while the quail was only adequate. Our Greek salads were just adequate as well; they were heavy on the iceberg lettuce and pretty bland. The red wine, which we ordered by the glass, seemed a bit off -- which reminds me also of the very loud and stunning rendition of \"happy birthday\" by one of the waiters; I think my date's description of a screaming elephant is an apt way to describe it;-)  Our conversation was interrupted again when all the items on a nearby table were casually placed on our table while the waiter replaced the tablecloth. Tasty baklava and coffee saved the day, and the free liqueur was a nice touch as well.  Overall 3 star meal, but I'm taking a star off for the ambiance which may be more suited to a larger group, and for the prices  -- there are too many other excellent restaurants in the city at the same price point or lower."}
{"text":"Saturday dinner for 5.
Made reservations... (definitely needed it!!)

shared saganaki + grilled octopus app..
octopus = very good (nicely grilled + very tender/tasty... moms devour her share)
saganaki = what i expected

entrees:
2 pork soulvaki dinner = good..
chicken soulvaki = better..
grilled calamari salad  = calamari very tasty but a bit salty after awhile...
lamp chops = massive pile of chops + tasty..
ordered a couple of greek beers .. waiter kindly recommended when asked ... (but no beer on tap).
gave us an extra greek salad .. and extra complimentary dessert...

wait staff very attentive and friendly... 
and boy does everyone seem to move fast..

portions are all quite generous...
everyone was stuffed... 
in and out in about an hour... (as i said.. they move fast!!)
took a long walk around the danforth to burn off my meat sweats...

definitely go again..
unanimous family approval.."}
{"text":"Friendly service and fresh seafood!

Decided to head to Danford to eat some Greek food with some friends and we found this one with gray reviews...it did not disappoint!

Took and appetizer of various dips and it was excellent. I think we had a total of 5 different dips.
1. Hummus
2. With dill
3. Spicy eggplant
4. Unknown pinkish dip
5. Unknown 
My favorite ones were the pinkish colour dip and the spicy eggplant

We then followed by the seafood platter (2-3 people according to the menu). The portion was so generous that it could easily serve 4 people.
Included in the platter was:
4 grilled calamari
Filet of sole
2 octopus tentacles 
4 grilled shrimps
Salted cod
Grilled salmon
Everything was very delicious and fresh. There wasn't much seasoning but you really don't need much when the seafood are fresh!

We told our waiter it was our first time and he had offered us their honey cake on the house.

We ordered some decaf coffee to go with our cake and the waiter came back saying that he is making a new pot of coffee for us. This is what I call service!

Loved the experience and the attentive service. Definitely recommend to everyone who is looking to  taste the great flavours of Greece."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been looking for a Greek restaurant that served food close to what we had when we were in Greece, and we finally found it!  Our best meals in Greece was just a Greek salad (served like the Horiatiki-village style, NO Lettuce), fried potatoes dressed with feta, and Saganaki. Simple right?  But it was hard to find a restaurant that served these things properly!  Will visit again and try the souvlaki."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple when I visit TO! It's located on the Danforth in Astoria,the Greek part of the city. The parking situation is tricky because only street parking is available. 
The decor is bland,unforgetable & furnished with your typical greek statues. The staff are a hit or miss,either really friendly or down right rude but all that considered,I still love eating here! It's a family owned restaurant.

The Saganaki is salty cheesy deliciouness flambeed table side. The fried calmari is perfectly cooked served with tzatziki sauce, the way it should be. I hate it when restaurants serve it with marinara sauce, it's nasty. I usually finish off with the chicken souvlaki platter which is served with rice, potatoes, carots & tzatziki! I'm sure they have better main courses but it makes me happy.

I've heard great things about the grilled calamari & will have to try it when I come back next time. Many of the dishes are made in house & not contracted out from what I've been told by the servers.

Keep in mind that I always split these 3 dishes wih a friend & am very content afterwards hence the reason I've never had dessert here but it does look lovely."}
{"text":"Our first attempt to visit this restaurant was unsuccessful because of the wait.  Flash forward a few months and we've finally made it back and kicking out selves hard for not having waited it out the first time!  Thankfully we have learned, and we will wait in line to get a table!  This place is that good!! Food, wine, service and atmosphere all come together to produce a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been there twice only this week, and a few times prior to that. I am getting slowly addicted to their food cuz it is very very very good. 

My favorite is dolmadakis; stuffed grape leaves but not cold like usual, served hot with a lemon based creamy sauce called avgolemono. Oh it is sooooo freaking good! 

The giant beans are yum, so creamy and soft with a tomato carrot sauce... you just have to try them. 

The village salad comes with a very generous portion of feta chunk (actually three chunks of feta), lots of thick olive oil and oregano. Only good stuff....

Grilled octopus entrée must be one of the best you can ever have. Their grilled calamari is equally good as well as the fried calamari appetizer. 

Revani dessert is like a soft bread soaked in syrup and some authentic flavors. 

I basically never had anything that I didn't like there yet. The owner is very nice. Service is usually descent. They have an outdoor patio. They are good for groups. Suitable for kids during lunch hours. They accept credit and debit cards."}
{"text":"Pros:
+ great Service
+ tasty food for fair price

Cons:
- meat was a bit over cooked.

Made a reservation for 6 people for Monday at 7:00 pm.  Once we got there, we asked for a table outside and they were happy to accommodate us.

Service (5 stars):
The main water (a man in his 60s) was very pleasant.  He ended up giving us free dips and free desert.  He kept coming around to refill the water glasses on regular bases but was not interrupting our conversations.  

Atmosphere: (3.5 stars)
We were seated outside, the area was a bit cramped, but pleasant overall.  

Food: (4 stars)
Appetizers:
5 stars - Saganki (fried cheese)  was amazing
5 stars - Dips 
3 stars - Dolmadakia (wine leaves with rice and meat inside) 

Main Courses:
5 stars - Beeftekia - make sure you put lemon on top of it
5 stars - Paidaki (lamb chops)
4.5 stars - Octapus
4 stars - Fried calamari
3.5 stars - Chiken souvlaki (a bit dry)
3.5 Stars pork souvlaki (also a bit dry)

Potatoes, Rice, and broccoli that come with the meal were amazing.

I would go there again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food in TO and I've been to a ton of Greek restaurants.

Every dish is amazing. Saganaki is my fave. Opa! Seafood is a specialty here and it's always cooked to perfection. If you like seafood, try the grilled calamari - it's very tender and never rubbery. The traditional dishes, like mousaka and souvlaki, are always great too.

Decor is simple and pleasing - white walls with Greek Gods painted on them. They have table cloths and cloth napkins.

Get a reservation on the weekend though, this place fills up fast! And ask for John Troupis, the owner, to be your server. He treats me like a king every time!"}
{"text":"My son wanted Greek food so we made it a family affair and headed down to Danforth. Loved the family atmosphere here and the food was amazing. Service was impeccable too!"}
{"text":"We just took friends from the UK here for lunch. We have a couple of children between us, and the first thing to say was how welcoming, open and friendly the staff were. 
After a fantastic sweet Greek coffee, we started off by sharing the large plate of dips which came with some marinated octopus and was wonderful. Not too heavy handed with the garlic and beautifully flavoured throughout.
After reading several reviews here, I had to go for the grilled calamari main course which lived up to it's reputation in every way. It sent me immediately back to a beach restaurant I went to in Greece which served the freshest of fish on a grill. The flavours and textures here were in every way it's equal. My wife had a steak salad which she said was great, and my friends had roast lamb and interestingly the fried calamari which was also very tasty.
The last thing to say is how generous the portion sizes were. It is refreshing to order calamari and seriously struggle to finish, but that's what happened. It's not often i can say that. At 16.95 this dish represents SERIOUSLY good value for money and would join others on this site in thoroughly recommending both the calamari and the restaurant on the whole to anyone."}
{"text":"AMAZING! 

Great staff and our server was such a gentleman! We ordered the tzatziki to start and I have never tasted a better tzatziki to this day, the portion was perfect for our table of 3 and it was devoured within minutes.

I had ordered a chicken souvlaki pita and the chicken was perfectly juicy! Their in house caesar dressing was nothing like ive ever tasted before!

My boyfriend and mother ordered lamb souvlaki and I hate lamb but I had a bite and fell in love! It was perfectly done right to both of their taste and needs and we were very satisfied! I am very happy I didn't end up going to Astoria or any of those wanna-be greek restaurants on the danforth. If you're looking for actual Greek cuisine, this is the best place hands down in the GTA :)"}
{"text":"Perfect. Visiting Toronto and went here as the best example of Greektown, and it was. Saganaki, octopus salad, grilled fish, roast lamb, honey cake. All delicious. The place had a family feel and service was attentive, if just a tad slow to get started."}
{"text":"I've been to Pantheon many times I figured it's time to write a review. First off if you want fresh fish and seafood dishes this is the place to go! To be honest when I come here I usually get some type of seafood. The grilled and fried Calamari are excellent. Today I had the Grilled Octopus. It was very tender and cooked perfectly. I got mine with a side of rice and fries. They gave an good amount of octopus on my plate I think I had 4 large pieces. The side of rice and fries was kind of slim. The Greek salad was also included and it was a good size. The only downside to my meal was that the octopus though cooked to perfection was lacking something. It's almost like I needed a little sauce on top it was a tad dry. Also for $29 for the plate I expected a bit more sides at least. All in all I would order this again as I was stuffed when done!"}
{"text":"I'm happy I found this restaurant in Toronto. Right in the heart of Greek town, this place served some solid food.

The server was friendly, and the food we had was tasty. We had the saganaki (pan seared cheese flambeed table side) which was salty, bubbly and delicious. We also had the lamb souvlaki dinner, which was a huge serving. The lamb was good, and the potatoes and sides had a very home-cooked feel to it, which I liked.

This is Greek comfort food, and it certainly hit the spot."}
{"text":"Super authentic Greek food and atmosphere! Reminded me of being in Greece! The pork souvlaki was awesome. I got the small portion and it was still more than I could finish!"}
{"text":"4.5 ! Very close to a 5. 

We did not have a reservation but I guess we came at the right time as we were seated immediately. Service was very prompt and there was always someone who filled our waters and asked us if everything was alright. Our server was very diplomatic when asked what's the best dish to order? He replied \"Everything's good\"! True in most cases!

We ordered the ..

Panthoeon Hot Combo for two (Spanakotiropita, grilled sauage, dolmadakia, grilled calamari, and grilled octopus.) So good! Even though the octopus looked a little disturbing, it was actually quite good. I've never had dolmadakia before, but loved the combo w/ the meat & vine leaves. They were delicious! 

Calamari - So good... imho,better than the one that was part of the pantheon hot combo for two. 

Chicken Souvlaki - The chicken was a little dry and I wish it came w/ more dipping sauce! It's hard to split it when you're with a group.

Seafood Pasta - Loved this! The sauce was amazing and it was so tasty! I did feel it was on the pricy side though. 

Saganaki (Fried Cheese) - there are no words... The only problem was it was a little it oily. Otherwise, OMG... my Greek version of the Fried Cheese from Guu! :D

Honey Cake - OMG this was delicious ! :D The cake was slightly dry by itself. However, the honey sauce was to die for and made the cake soft after being coated.

Some of the entrees also came with rice, potatos and veggies. The potatos were very generous in size.

We cannot wait to come back again next time! Awesome service and food!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner on Friday night, early, and there was lots of seating available. My wife had the calamari, our 17-month-old son had the chicken souvlaki and fries, and I went with the lamb chops. All were delicious! Pantheon doesn't hold back on the salt; this basic seasoning made things so tasty. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked to medium. The waiters were attentive. I would recommend Pantheon for a family dinner or a get-together with friends."}
{"text":"We made a reservation by the window and when we got there they said it's been taken. We were even 5 mins early and they let us down!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant and sampled a variety of dishes.  The prices are higher than most restaurants but for the quality of food it evens out.  The best dishes of the day was the fried calamari (the serving is huge as well as the calamari), and the scallops which was baked with cheese and mushrooms. The restaurant's atmosphere definitely needs a facelift and the service was nothing special."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and inexpensive! Be prepared for the crowds and the noise and be sure to request olive oil or dipping sauce for the piping hot pita bread, I need eat nothing more!"}
{"text":"Service is always great here. Food is consistent. One of my favourite places to eat on the Danforth."}
{"text":"A pretty fantastic restaurant with solid Greek offerings that go far beyond gyros and tzatziki sauce.

The service here stands out more than anything else. The older Greek gentlemen running the place really want you to like it. My significant other and myself ordered just two entrees, which they considered to be \"not enough\" food, so beforehand they brought out a sampler of their many kinds of fresh dips with vegetables and bread for dipping.

Honestly? Kind of amazing. I didn't think I'd like any of them, but they were all sort of delicious in their own way. One had vegetables and a bit of a kick on the aftertaste, and another felt like the cousin of a flavored cream cheese.

Although the prices are a bit steeper than I'm used to for Greek fare, the chicken pita is tasty and clocks in under $9. The grilled calamari is also pretty damn good."}
{"text":"On a sunny day, their sidewalk patio is on the shaded side of the Danforth.

It was easy to imagine I was in Greece, listening to snippets of Greek conversation while enjoying my grilled calamari. My friend H is not into seafood but she had two skewers of grilled vegetables which she totally enjoyed. I'm not a fan of veggies, but I must say that the zucchini, mushrooms and peppers were sweet and delicious. My only regret was not ordering the fish which I saw in the chiller. We asked for more of their complimentary mints after we paid and they gave us a handful. Overall, a great experience and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Greek restaurant with great service. Calamari was cooked perfectly but I would stay away from the octopus if you are not a big fan of a strong fishy flavour. But we Really enjoyed the complementary honey cake! Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We had a really delicious dinner here! 

We arrived at around 6pm and were seated immediately. The servers brought us bread and water right away while we looked at the menu. 

We decided on chicken souvlaki and the fried calamari appetizer. 

The calamari was fried nicely but was soft and fresh tasting. Priced at around $16, it's a bit expensive considering their main dishes are around $15-$25, but still worthwhile for a calamari fanatic like me. 

The chicken souvlaki was outrageously juicy and delicious. I'm not sure how they cook it to be so juicy but it's some of the best souvlaki I've ever had, possibly the best chicken I've ever had, plus it was white meat, which is harder to cook to that sort of perfection. This meal is served with a Greek salad, which was dressed nicely and topped with a healthy portion of feta cheese, and on the side of the chicken comes some rice, potatoes and carrots. The carrots and rice were good, I wasn't crazy about the potatoes, I would probably ask for extra carrots next time, they were really delicious. The small souvlaki portion is quite large, even for a big eater, it's likely enough food, but there is a large option for $3 extra. 

At the end of the meal we were brought a piece of cake which was a nice, unexpected treat! The cake almost had a cornbread-meets-vanilla cake texture, and was soaked in some type of syrup which made it sweeter, I loved the cake and thought it was a nice gesture. 

The service is no-nonsense, efficient, our waiter in particular wasn't especially sweet or anything but he was quick and effective. Some of the other guys who brought us food would talk a bit more or make a quick joke but didn't hang out excessively. They run a tight ship and they're good at it! 

The restaurant is very similar to other Greek spots on the Danforth, decorated Greek-style with murals depicting Greece and Greek sculptures on the walls. They can likely use a bit of a facelift but I like that it's sort of classic Danforth. 

Overall a really good experience, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food and if someone in your group is having a birthday - there is an old waiter who sings Happy Birthday hilariously!  Must be seen to be believed!

We have had so many great meals here, the dips with pita are flavourful and if you like Tzatziki, you must try it here, it is the real deal. 

Grilled Octopus, Saganaki (cheese lit on fire tableside - OPA!) Mousaka (a Greek Shepherd's pie made with meat, eggplant and rich bechamel sauce) and my personal favourite - Slow Roasted Lamb, the list of our favourites goes on and on.

I have dined here with people who were born and raised in Greece, so if they say this place is authentic, I will take their word for it, and the food is consistently good.

The service is always prompt and courteous.

My only advice is don't be afraid to go beyond the usual Souvlaki dinner... you can get that a lot of places, the authentic items on Pantheon's menu are worth trying.

If you plan to go on a Saturday night  make reservations in advance, as the place fills up quick.

Gluten free diners have tons of choices here, just don't eat the bread, phylo, cake... or the pita, which is hard to resist because it is perfectly grilled and served warm."}
{"text":"Not the biggest greek fan in the world but I did like their Shawarmas. Was a very friendly family atmosphere and they were very patient with us when we had to wait for the rest of our group to arrive. 

For what you pay for, you get a really good deal. Just can't give it a 5 but it is darn close. 

Potatoes are amazing."}
{"text":"My first visit to Pantheon was a pleasant one. I made reservations for a group of 4 for Friday night at 7, and when we arrived there were still several tables available (granted it was also a miserable rainy spring evening). Although we were seated at a table for 4, when the rest of our party arrived, the hostess told them there were no reservations under our name and to go and wander around the restaurant to see if they recognized anyone. A little odd... 

Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, but another waiter who refilled our water unfortunately had terrible B.O. that lingered at our table even after he had left, only to return with a vengeance each time he quickly returned  to refill our water glasses anytime anyone had a sip. Not pleasant and we tried to ignore it. 

We started with the spanakopika, which had wonderful flaky pastry and delicious filling. Then we ordered various dishes, from seafood to the typical chicken souvlaki and no one complained but nothing stood out as fantastic. All of us found the food quite salty as well.

The ambience of the place was lacking as all the tables are set out under glaring pot lights and as the night went on, the place got very very noisy. In the past we had tried a Mr. Greek in the same area and preferred their booths and more understated decor.

As we were there celebrating my birthday and I was too embarrassed for the usual singing by the waiters, our table was kindly provided with shots of a Greek ice wine. We also had the complimentary honey cake, which was good.

For a table of 4 with one shared appetizer, a series of main dishes, and a bottle of Greek wine, we paid about $150 plus tip. Overall the service is excellent with very attentive staff, but the food and ambience could be better."}
{"text":"On the recommendations of a co-worker, we had dinner there last week. Overall, the food was not good and way below our expectations. We started with a salad that was swimming in dressing and tasted sour. This was followed by spanakopita which is always baked and when served has little or no oil. Our dish was literally swimming in oil. When I asked the waiter why  the spanakopita was fried, he insisted that it was not fried but baked but could not explain the presence of large amount of oil (did not taste like olive oil, either). We also ordered a grilled bass which tasted foul. After all this we skipped the deserts. On the way out we looked at the refrigerated glass case and saw a few more bass. The fish looked old (sunken, dull eyes) and my wife said that she would have never bought fish that looked like that. The service was OK  We had to pour the wine ourselves, and had to repeat twice requests for lemon and water.
May be it was a day off but we will never return. There are  much better Greek restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 7/10.

SERVICE: the service is absolutely exceptional. No. Implants whatsoever. The waiters are friendly and will always help you choose something tasty on the menu.

FOOD: the food is tasty, by I've tried slightly better tasting food at nearby restaurants such as Mezes and Pan on the Danforth. One of their specialties, Saganaki pan seared cheese, was tasty, but $16 is too much IMO. The dips were tasty too, albeit with a bit too much garlic.

Bottom line: I doubt you'll be disappointed if you go to Pantheon, but there are better options within 700-1000M east of this place on Danforth."}
{"text":"My 400th review goes to the Pantheon Restaurant!

For some reason, despite my big love for Greek cuisine and the Danforth in general, I have never eaten at Pantheon until recently.

Apparently I have been missing out because I was truly impressed with the food and service here.

Pantheon is decorated in a more traditional \"taverna\" style Greek restaurant as opposed to a fine dining look that many of the other good Danforth spots go for (Ouzeri, Pan on the Danforth, Mezes). 

The walls are adorned with lots of cheesy hand-painted landscapes covered over with Greek mythology posters and other fun kitschy bits. The tables are set close together and the place gets packed with hungry customers.

2 of my bestest Yelper friends and I decided to share a mixed platter for $32, piled with 2 dolmades (stuffed grape vine leaves), 2 spanokopita (spinach pie), 2 huge pieces of grilled kalamari, a giant piece of grilled octopus and a big fat Greek sausage. Every item on the platter was delicious and perfectly cooked. 

We also shared a plate of tzatziki and pita for $6.95.

Our waiter was an absolute gem! I thanked him using my newly acquired Greek word (Efharisto!) and was stoked that he understood and responded in Greek. THEN he brought us a big slice of FREE CAKE! (Honey cake - Melopita)

Overall - a brilliant meal, very reasonable prices (we paid $17 each included tax and tip) and great service. Free cake rules.

Opa!"}
{"text":"When you think of Greek restaurants, you think of delicious food, piled high on your plate; friendly service, from people who make you feel welcome and appreciate your business.  This is exactly what you get at Pantheon.  

My friend and I came here for dinner this evening and had Souvlaki Dinners - I had the chicken, and he had the pork.  The highlights of this meal were the carrots and the chicken (the star if the show).  The carrots were so naturally sweet and tasty they could have easily been put on the dessert menu.  The chicken was one great big piece of melt in your mouth juicy goodness!!!   I highly recommend this meal and will be back again for another go at it.

The only take away for me was how crowded the patio was; we could have done with one or two less tables, to spread the diners out.  When my friend and I were conversing, I felt as if the person at the next table was part of the discussion, as he was so close and leaning in our direction.  I'll admit partly creepy on his part, but if the tables were more spaced apart this wouldn't have been an issue."}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time recently, and I was just as impressed as the first time. If you are looking for an authentic Greek/Mediterranean experience with savoury food and welcoming atmosphere, check this place out!

ATMOSPHERE:

A great family vibe and lively atmosphere, with a really diverse crowd frequenting this place. It has been really busy both times I've come, so try to plan ahead - that being said, it's a fairly large space with lots of seating.

FOOD:

\"Saganaki\" (flaming fried cheese) is a crowd favourite, not only because it tastes amazing (for those who like a bit of a saltier cheese), but also because they flambe it right in front of you.

\"Pork Tenderloin\" was a bit of a disappointment, being pretty dry. 

\"Appetizer plate\" comes with grilled or fried calamari and octopus, spinach/cheese pie, and grilled sausage.  The sausage was just Ok, but the pie and fried calamari impressed - calamari was lightly battered and seased, but thicker than a lot of the other restaurants that serve stringier versions. 

\"Seafood pasta\" steals the show by far - I really have to find out how they manage to get their linguine so that's it's so silky and creamy. 

Most of the dishes come with a generous side of salad and potatoes.

SERVICE:

On our last visit, our server Mike was really friendly and attentive. He did a great job, and just seemed like a genuinely nice guy. Most of the servers here seem to actually enjoy their work, and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the place. One of the older gentlemen waiters put on a bit of a show (twice!) with his very entertaining singing of 'Happy Birthday' to two tables in our area. He was absolutely terrrrible, but he had so much fun, as did the tables he served.

VERDICT:

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The city's best and Authentic Greek Food, and friendliest service. 
This is the only restaraunt where I'll eat Greek from a restaurant."}
{"text":"First impression of Greek food was had here. I'm not usually a fan of pork but my friend told me that they do it really well here and she was right!  So glad that this place is nearby so when I crave it I know where to go!"}
{"text":"Freezing and famished, a friend and I shuffled into Pantheon as our second-choice restaurant for a mid-afternoon nosh when we came to the unfortunate realization that our restaurant of choice was mysteriously closed. The interior certainly screams \"Hellenic\", with walls bedecked with painted vines and portraits of Greek gods. Upon being seated and giving the menu a cursory glance, we were greeted with zest and vigor by our server, \"Bobby\". Water was poured and we were provided with a small basket of rather mediocre-looking bread, but I was too hungry to care and quickly gobbled down three pieces like a raptor. Bobby, noticing the empty basket (as a good server should), was quick to offer more bread, even upping the ante by asking if we wanted to try their wonderful garlic bread instead. I must have been in a catatonic, hunger-induced state of rapture as I was unable to formulate a coherent response (these things do happen, you know). Luckily, Bobby took my silence as a yes and took charge of the situation, assuring us that we would love the garlic bread, which was brought out shortly after (it was okay). 

I ordered the small platter of dips (Pantheon Dips Pikilia) with pita, but requested a substitute for the Taramosalata, as I'm a vegetarian. My request was very kindly accommodated with no attitude, and I was even allowed my pick of dip as a replacement (I chose the Melitzanosalata - delicious!). Overall, the dips were quite good and I enjoyed the wide variety, although personally I found the Tirokafteri a little salty for my taste. My lovely dining companion ordered Chicken on a pita, and the response to the question I always ask about chicken (\"Is it moist?!\") was a yes. I tried some of her fries, however, and I thought that they left a lot to be desired...they tasted suspiciously like the McCain's frozen variety with a sprinkling of some green herb or another on top for a \"Greek flair\". 

Our bill came to around $30 in total with tax and tip (we did not imbibe). I would say the food was average, but I'm adding another star just for Bobby. I found great amusement in his verve and enthusiasm, as well as the fact that he appeared to be somewhat of a conspiracy theorist. A good choice for Greek food on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"Pantheon is always our number 1 choice for Greek food on the Danforth.  My husband took me to Pantheon on our first dinner date so it holds a special place in my heart..heehee...

The restaurant is staffed with a number of friendly waiters who genuinely enjoy serving the food and will occasionally sing really loud (and off tune) for you when it's your birthday.  All of my Greek friends go to Pantheon so I think that might mean that it has a good reputation in the Greek community (it serves a lot of traditional favourites).  The decor is a little dated and tacky with Greek inspired paintings on the wall, but the place is huge.  There are usually lots of big dinner parties on the weekends and it can get quite noisy depending on where you are sitting.  Also, if anyone around you (or you) orders the saganaki flaming cheese, be prepared to hear a loud \"OPA\" and have your hair heat up from the open flame.  If you're visiting for the first time, have your camera ready to catch the cheese flame--it's quite the sight!

One tip I have is to skip the free bread in the beginning to make room for all of the other goodies that you'll be ordering. Because trust me..you will wish that you saved room once the real food comes to the table.

A few favourites of ours include:  saganaki cheese appetizer (flaming cheese...so delicious), grilled calamari (always a generous amount, grilled to perfection), hummus (best hummus on the block!) with whole wheat pita.  

Sometimes when we come with a big group we order the small dip platter.  It comes with about 5 different types of Greek dips--delicious!  The best part of the dips platter is the spicy salmon dip and the hummus.

My husband always orders the traditional souvlaki dinner--either pork or lamb--and goes through a dilemma every time we go because it's so hard for him to decide which one to choose.  He usually alternates them because he loves them both.  After filling yourself with appetizers, the small souvlaki dinner is more then enough to fill you up.  The souvlaki dinners come with a Greek salad that is always fresh and has lots of feta on it.  The house Greek dressing is extremely tasty and doesn't overpower the salad.  Also, the souvlaki dinners are usually served with rice, potatoes (marinated in something that makes them melt in your mouth...) and carrots.  

If the waiters like you or if they're in a good mood (which is usually always), they will bring out special honey cake dessert--on the house!  This cake is so amazing!  Fluffy and just the right amount of honey to make it just sweet enough.  The cake usually comes drizzled with chocolate on the plate, but you don't need to use the chocolate on the cake--it's good enough on its own!"}
{"text":"very solid greek place. Family run (as many are) with courteous service and quick turn around. I generally order grilled octopus and greek salad and have yet to be disappointed. Phone service is great and they usually have my order ready in under 15."}
{"text":"Fun evening. Food was great. Flaming cheese was the best. Our waiter was wonderful too. He said he's worked there 17 years.  Chicken souvlaki was fabulous."}
{"text":"I've tried a few times WITH fail to effectively introduce Greek food to my fiancee.... first in Japan (not surprised) and once in Europe. Therefore, it was critical to find the \"right\" place for our first trip to Greek Town in Toronto. My fellow yelpers did not disappoint. Based on reviews we decided to give Pantheon a try and let's start with the most important part - my fiancee liked/possibly loved the food. So today I will try a list of pro's, con's.... Let me add however, that I have had better Greek Food in Vancouver!

Pro's:

- Fiancee liked their food (Is there such a thing as a bigger pro than this? I think not!)
- Greek salad Feta and sauce was outstanding
- Meat was of very good quality (steak + chicken) and cooked properly
- Complimentary honey cake at the end (seems the norm though but great)
- Excellent selection of dishes 
- Tzatziki dip was GLORIOUS as Mr. Ferral would say.....
- Close to subway (easy to find)
- Roughly 42 dollars for 2 meat dishes and a drink each (perfect!)
- The most horrible sounding, yet best performance birthday singing
- Vegetables were very fresh, lemon potatoes were good

Con's:

- No pita bread with the souvlaki meal? WTF is that! This was a first and very disappointing. Nothing better than dipping your pita bread in the Tzatziki 

- Lettuce in the greek salad - OK I am not going to bicker about authenticity, simply put I like my greek salad with cucumbers and not lettuce (with that said, my fiancee did like it a lot) - not used to carrots, celery and some of the other things as well, but hey it was good

- More FETA in the greek salad please!!!!

- Not enough Tzatziki sauce is given - OK maybe I like to drown everything in Tzatziki, but the little portion they give you is not big enough


So obviously, not too much to complain about overall. I will say that this is definitely an above average greek place, but most of the family run greek restaurants I've been to around Vancouver are of the same standard (a few higher even). 

I will definitely return to this restaurant in the future, but will look to try one of the few other higher rated restaurants next time to compare - recs are most welcome!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite Greek place in the city, and I have been to a lot. The waitstaff has always been incredibly accomodating, and I have absolutely no criticisms about them or the food.

Serving sizes are usually pretty big, so bring your appetites."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant! I have been going there for years with my family, and we've never disliked it. There has always been something delicious to eat, even when I was two years old! It's a nice atmosphere, the waiters are friendly, and everybody loves it! Best Greek restaurant outside Greece. Go there!

P.S. For kids of any ages, the pasta and the chicken and rice soup is a good choice!"}
{"text":"Delicious pork souvlaki! Cooked just right. The rice and fries side is also delicious.

The complementary honey cake is so good.

The Greek salad served was a bit disappointing though. The size was too small and it was lacking dressing. A small complaint for an otherwise great meal."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Highly recommended. I'll admit; this is the first restaurant I have been to on the Danforth, but I'm confident in stating it will be the one I will always return to.

Food is superb. The grilled calamari appetizer had me  day dreaming about Greek food for days. Every single meal at our table exceeded expectations. 

Service was unparalleled. Our waters were refill before even being empty. The older gentleman waiting on tables were exceptional at their job and extremely sweet while doing it. And for a busy Friday night our appetizers and entrees were delivered to our table quite fast. Complimentary cake was offered but after such big portions we were too full to take that on. Service industry workers should come and take notes!

My advice:
- Do not miss out on the calamari
- There is a shrimp appetizer in sauce and cheese, I forgot the name but it is DELICIOUS 
- The grill mix is a great way to sample everything and is big enough to share
- If you are feeling less adventurous the regular souvlaki dinners are still amazing and well portioned"}
{"text":"Another plain simple food restaurant. Each dish about $4 more than the othr greek restnts on th street. Service was good. Moussaka was nice. no pita or bread came with dip had to pay extra. Complimentary honey bread dessert was tasty."}
{"text":"The service started gold. I received the wrong salad and the server argued with me although I was being polite. He than did not take my salad to the kitchen, instead he brought extra toppings and dumped it on my salad. At the end of the meal my friend and I went to pay, the cashier then asked how everything was and we explained what happened. The server than came over to us and began to tell us again how we were wrong. ----Okayyy, chill out dude. We did not receive an apology. Also the quality of food was much less than the price."}
{"text":"Heading out to the Danforth for dinner we searched for a new Greek place to try something different and we discovered the Pantheon Restaurant.

The place is made up of two separate dining rooms that run long and narrow away from the street with a garage door on the front that opens when the weather is warm. On the one side is the bar and a few tables which are tightly packed together in groups of four. The decor is old world Greek with lots of plaster statues, and paintings of places in Greece and Greek Gods. It has that well worn feel of a local place that has been there forever and as the evening worn on we could see why. It was busy with lots of Greeks coming in for an evening dinner. 

The menu had a diverse selection of appetizers and dishes and offered something for everyone. While the prices were a little more expensive than some other places on the Danforth it was reflected in the attentive service and the food. We ordered some grilled octopus, a couple of souvalki's some hummus, eggplant dip and fried eggplant and zucchini. Everything arrived warm, delicious and beautifully presented. Sadly, we ordered too much food and found ourselves stuffed. The portions were more than generous and the quality of the food deserving of the price. It was agreed by all that the place was deserving of its reputation."}
{"text":"The most authentic culinary greek experience I have yet to witness in north america. After coming back from a month long trip to greece, I was starved for another taste of saganaki and pork and lamb souvlaki. Needless to say, the staff is very friendly and immersive. The food is exquisite as well."}
{"text":"the best traditional Greek restaurant. the waiters are great with everyone! fresh fish and fantastic dip!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, no matter what you order. It's true, the calamari isn't rubbery. Special orders/allergies are no problem. I don't care for battered fries, but everything else was fine. Great service. Parking on the street or in a nearby public lot. Sufficient number of options on the menu, but not so big that you wonder if they do anything well. Bring glass or metal containers in with you as you are sure to have leftovers and their takeout containers are all styrofoam. Large portions. Only seating options are chairs and tables. Bathrooms are in the basement."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend as I was inkling for some thing Greek and something beefy and we just happened to be in Greek street, Danforth.  I was thinking Beef Souvlaki, but it was not on their lunch menu and it was pricey on their dinner menu.

I instead opted for their lunch special NY Steak on a salad.  Medium Rare.

While waiting for my food, got some free bread and butter, tastes good, but I didn't find anything out of the ordinary that I should be aware of.

After a few minutes, I didn't really notice since I had some good conversation, my food had arrived.  My verdict: excellent food (except for the onions and olives because I don't like those, but if I did like them, they were fresh and strong).  Their herbs are pretty well wrought into their meat and it gives a pleasant after-aroma.

Service was way beyond par.  Water gets refilled automatically without asking.  That's a pretty major feat considering how quickly I usually drink.

They ended giving us some complementary honey cake.  Man that cake was amazing.  It looked like a sponge cake and tested almost like very honeyish sweet (as opposed to sickeningly sweet that you get with most cheap cakes at non-Chinese supermarkets and Dairy Queen) leche flan.   Also when you cut into it with a fork you sometimes get honey drizzling out some of the pores (I wonder how they did that).

Anyway this is now my favorite Greek restaurant which unfortunately I would rarely go to since it is in Downtown Toronto and I usually avoid places like this."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant. From the friendly waiters and staff to the Mediterranean decor, we loved everything about our visit. The food is a bit pricey but worth it. Will definitely come back to try some more items. We got saganaki and grilled octopus - it was delicious."}
{"text":"Before rock-climbing nearby, we stopped by the Pantheon to have a quick fuel up.  Couldn't decide between a bunch of the appetizers on the menu so the logical choice was to go with the appetizer platter!  With that you get grilled calamari, grilled octopus, spanakotyropita, grilled sausage, and dolmades.  

We were the only table in the restaurant at the time and the complimentary basket of uninspiring bread with whipped butter packets and water tided us over while waiting for our food.  We pondered over what seemed like a long time to get an appetizer platter.  Happy to say that the wait was definitely worth it, as the food came out freshly grilled, spankotyropita had an excellent crunch to the phyllo pastry surrounding a smooth spinach and cheese filling.  The flavour of the sausage surprised me, but in a good way. Just wasn't expecting that kind of flavour from it, but it was yummy.  The grilled squid and octopus were really well done, with no chewiness indicating overcooking.  I usually won't even touch octopus when it comes to sushi after having some bad experiences, but I chowed down almost an entire tentacle serving here! 

I would come back here again just for this appetizer platter."}
