{"text":"VEGAS SOL barbecue also known as Rocketman Barbecue offers great choices for a great price with great flavor. Anything barbecue beef, pork, chicken, and more. The sides are great too."}
{"text":"Invited to a catered event, the food was amazing. I am a rib guy and I can be very harsh when judging ribs. These ribs were outstanding. I went back for more and even manage to get a few to take home. The other selections were just as good: chicken, brisket, potato salad and some mac n cheese. I judge my BBQ by the ribs, had to find these guys on Yelp! to give a rating to match the food, 5 stars."}
{"text":"AMAZING.. You'll see! We had Vegas Sol BBQ cater our wedding of 150 guests and was amazing with price, communication and friendliness! The food was SO savory, I still crave it! We had the brisket, pulled chicken, beans, rolls and their awesome cream corn! Highly recommend them!"}
