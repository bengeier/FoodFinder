{"text":"Had the beefcheek sandwich when I went, it was tender, juicy with delicious smoked flavours. You start to drool slightly when you walk through the door with the smell of meat and and heavenly juices flowing through the air. We them quite often as our butcher, good prices for some fantastic cuts of meat. The eggs they bring in are from a local Ontario farm. This is a gem of a local business, so glad they opened. I highly recommend you check it out of you're in the area or are looking for a tasty treat!"}
{"text":"Everything is outstanding. We live in the Junction and always frequent this place, specially those days when I'm not sure what I'm craving.  Im confident I'll be satisfied with the food!!

By far one of the best sandwich places in the city.  And they have daily specials, assortment of goodies and more. 

Staff are very welcoming as well

A must try!"}
{"text":"one of the best sandwiches ive ever had, staff are awesome, deli and dry good options are
amazing......dont miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Such a cute spot. I've tried 3 things since discovering this place. The Peameal sandwich fully loaded (Peameal, runny egg, cheese & bacon - what's not to love). #fantabulous!!!!!!! I loved it so much that I've had it each time I've been there. Which is twice in 4 days. The other item I ordered was the Philly cheesesteak. Also amazing. Lastly I tried the jerk chicken meal with coleslaw and rice and peas. The jerk chicken was good and so was the coleslaw. My only disappointment was the rice and peas. It was not what I expected. It came in the form of a cold salad. Which, if I had known, I wouldn't have ordered it. Other than the rice and peas hiccup everything else was very good very flavorful. I will be going back for that Peameal Sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Grabbed the Korean BBQ Chicken with Kimchi special and it blew my mind. The best chicken I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything looked amazing it is almost impossible to choose a sandwich. I will be back soon to keep working my way down the menu."}
{"text":"By far the best Jerk Chicken sammich I ever had!!!!
Tasty, tasty!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Small and cozy. Food is delicious and the staff are SUPER friendly. I have tried the peameal and jerk chicken sandwich. Highly recommend peameal with EVERYTHING (egg, cheese, and bacon.) so good and satisfying!  price range is about $7-12 ish for a sandwich depends on your order."}
{"text":"I stopped there at lunch today and had the Korean pork BBQ sandwich with kimchi. It was  delicious!  The staff is friendly and the meat was cooked right in front of me! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich place in town. Everything is delicious  and the staff is so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"There is so much to love about this place....as noted in the other reviews.  However, my $12 smoked beef cheeks sandwich had very little meat, and the edges of it were hard as ROCK.  I must have got the burnt end of it.  The bread was also tiny and burnt on the crust so that it was also hard as rock.  The beef was 'candied' with some sort of sugar and with the burnt parts stuck to my teeth like crazy glue.  I saw a few of these mind blowing sammies that were full of meat, about twice the size and not burnt.  Guess I just got a last of the batch one....these should not be sold!"}
{"text":"The best smoked meat sandwich, I've had outside of Montreal. Will return to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I went back recently and ordered the smoke meat sandwich. Was disappointed with the meager portion of meat. Seems the portions have decreased since the last time I visited."}
{"text":"I haven't had a better sandwich. Wow!  Had 'the Joseph' - smoked meat, maple, egg, provolone.  It was perfect!  Highly recommend this spot for a quick bite!  Limited seating but you'll want to squeeze in and eat it straight away!"}
{"text":"When The Pig Came Home is located near the south west corner of Dundas and the end of High Park Ave in the Junction.

Not since I've been to Shadow Meats Squared in Seattle did I have a truly transcendent almost out of body experience when having a sandwich.  That was way back in 2014 and believe me when I say there have been many, many sandwiches consumed in the past 4 years that had the opportunity to bring me to the same place where SM2 was able to bring me to which was essentially sandwich Nirvana.

When The Pig Came Home is a small footprint of a butcher shop along with serving made to order hot sandwiches.  They have what is dubbed the original peameal on a bun for 5 bucks but with variations of this.  I mean you can add an egg for a dollar or a slice of cheddar or double smoked bacon for another dollar.  Basically you can get a fully loaded breakfast sandwich for 8 bucks.

Porchetta under the lights, behind glass for your viewing pleasure much like the other restaurant for which it is their namesake.  They have options to add rapini (yes it's called rapini not broccoli rabe you Americanos) or provolone for a buck or truffle sauce for 75 cents.  If you've never had pork and rapini together let me tell you that it's a magical combination just like bacon and eggs or wings and beer.  They truly go together like any other duo that just belongs to complement one another.

Now the thing is I didn't order the sandwich this go around.  It was my friend who had ordered what seemingly was a special called \"The Ben\" because I didn't know what was in it but I ate it.  How's that for a review?  I'm about to give 5 stars to something in which I didn't even know what it was exactly but at the time I didn't care.  I mean this was a sandwich and not some sort of debilitating recreation drug.  I've read before in the past of people trying to explain what it was like to experience crack cocaine.  I mean I'm NOT into those type of things at all nor am I interested but I just remember reading somewhere where somebody tried to describe it as a full body orgasm.  For me, this sandwich was as close as I could probably get to explaining it in words for simply just eating this \"The Ben\".

Looking back at the picture because I was in some sort of trance when I was actually consuming half of this thing that came down from heaven to me it looks to be some sort of sandwich that looks like what's described above as peameal, smoked strip bacon, cheese and egg.  I'd be lying if I told you that I knew exactly what I was eating or if I had even bothered to look between the bread.  I just bit, chewed, went somewhere on a spiritual level, swallowed and repeated this process about 5 or 6 times before returning from where ever it was I went for those few minutes.

I swear it had to be the best thing I remember eating since the Korean fried chicken at Turntable.  It was that freaking good.  I have to stop talking and thinking about this because now I want to go there and I can't really go just now.  

Besides having amazing sandwiches this place is also a butcher.  Maybe it's a great idea to get a sandwich AND bring home some meat for good eats at home too.  I'd most definitely buy some special types of bacon (yes, plural) for the future.  

The seating at this place is rather limited to just bar stool seating facing the front window.  I noticed a few people taking hot food to go in additional to purchasing raw meat as well in the short time we were there which was just before closing."}
{"text":"I read about this place on my go to site, BlogTO and saw smoked meat sandwiches so my eyes became sparkly. I knew I had to try this place with my boyfriend. The last good smoked meat sandwich I had was at Schwartz's in Montreal. I kid...you...not..how this place does theirs wins Schwartz's. (at least to me) I know, to Montrealers this may seem like blasphemy but let me explain. The quantity is definitely smaller than Schwartz's, but the quality is there. The meat has a thicker cut, and some lovely charred edges that Schwartz's does not give you. The charred edges give it a more interesting touch. I also loved the porchetta sandwich, it had some crispy parts, and at the same time a soft chew to it. But the smoked meat sandwich was the winner for me.

Great new spot. I have yet to try the peameal though! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"ok I read about this on yelp so i was excited as some people described this as the best smoked meat and they had gone everywhere for it...even Montreal.  So maybe this is why it was a letdown?  too high of an expectation?  I had no charred bits on mine (we all can't all get it) though I'm sure those bits are really tasty.  I thought the quantity of meat was skimpy but the price wasn't over the top so maybe that's why...gotta make a profit.  But a bit more meat would had been nice. I'm not sure how oz it was but just a bit more....not double but just a bit more would had been the cat's meow.
I also tried the porchetta and that had bits of charred bits and it did make the sandwich really tasty and wanted me to have that again.  But since that is impossible to have every time, I'd say if you're in the area, and want a good sandwich, it would fit the bill.  But I wouldn't drive there just to have it cause you can't be guaranteed charred bits with every sandwich and that was part of what made it better than good. It was decent (quality, price)"}
{"text":"Omg, where too start. If you love food, this is definitely a place to check out when in the Junction. They serve some of the best sandwiches in the neighbourhood and have and very fine selection of local charcuterie and ethnically raised meats. Incredible steaks, pork chops, bacon, sausages and ect."}
{"text":"The fucking beef cheek is the cats meow, the bees knees, and everything in between!  Sandwiches are some of my favourite foods and this possibly takes the cake as the best sandwich I've ever had.  Smoky, melty, and peppery make for a perfect combination of flavours to give you a full on foodgasm in your mouth."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy place at The Junction that offers wonderful sandwiches at a mild reasonable price (between 12 and 16).  I highly recommend the Philly Cheese steak and the Korean bbq.  The size of the sandwiches is not so big, but is enough for one person.  The staff is really kind and the place looks very clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"The sandwiches (porchetta, peamel) EXCELLENT! I would return to the junction just for the food. They could use some AC, cashing out process a bit slow. 
Staff was really friendly and highly likable. 
Can't wait to try smoked meat."}
{"text":"Geez. What is not to love about a place that started out as a couple of guys busting their ass at the local Junction Farmers Market who managed to open their own storefront? Nothing.

The peameal sandwich with an egg was both a bargain and $6.78 of pure deliciousness. The guys are super friendly and make a mean sandwich. You can also enjoy a cooked to order porcetta sandwich, as well as pick up some great seasonings, cold-cuts, and accompanying BBQ condiments by the jar.

When you come here realize that all orders are cooked on the spot, so you may wait 5-10 minutes. There are only a couple of seats in the window. You may need to get yours to go.

I was thoroughly impressed. Glad to have this awesome option in the Junction."}
{"text":"If you've been craving Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, then it's time to get yourself up to the Junction. 

This deli and lunch counter, opened in the summer of 2016, by Junction resident Ryan Gartner. He had been previously selling his peameal bacon sandwiches at the Junction Farmer's Market and decided to expand his business to a brick and mortar store. For us Junction residents, we're super grateful. 

Inside the shop, there is seating for four and a mini bench outside with seating for two. The menu is small, but perfect. You'll find sandwiches ranging from Jerk Chicken, Philly Cheesesteak, Smoked Meat, Porchetta and of course, Peameal. These sandwiches are all super customizable, thick cut and topped with housemade mustards and pickles that will make your mouth water on the spot. 

One thing to note: the cash-out process can be a bit slow, as a bar design is a bit rough. But all in all, it's a super positive experience and all your sandwishes come true in this place."}
{"text":"This newly opened delicatessen opened up in the neighbourhood not too long ago! Finally got to try and wowza!  I'm loving it so far.  Inside is simply, clean and on display under the heat lamp are MEATS--vegetarians this is not for the faint of heart!

They have some cured meats available for purchase but seems like they focus on their cooked versions that made into sandwiches, ie, jerk chicken, Peameal, purchette, etc.

I tried the $5 Peameal sandwich (+$1 for an egg +$1 for cheese) and it was wonderful! Just wonderful!

I'll definitely be back to try out more!

Seating is limited to 3 stools at the front and a bench outside."}
{"text":"This place is one of Toronto's rare treasures. Stop by for a sandwich that will blow your mind."}
{"text":"Love these sandwiches. Peameal bacon was great and the porchetta was amazing. can't get enough of the sandwiches. go for the porchetta with cheese and rapini."}
{"text":"This place is all kinds of awesome.
Where to start?????
Peameal on a bun get the \"Ben\"!!

Porchetta on a bun take the house special!

The sausages are awesome ..my fav so far is the pork and veal with apple and blue cheese!

Also..do yourself a favour get them to make you a charcutteri board for a party... amazing!

The owner and his partner (I assume) are super friendly and make you feel welcome. 

This is going to be a regular haunt for us!"}
{"text":"I've had the peameal sandwich and the house porchetta, both were outstanding. Crunchy, tender, nice mix of flavours. I crave them on weekends. Ordered sausages and potato salad/coleslaw for BBQ I was hosting and everything was amazing! Rave reviews from my guests - was a nice touch to add pickles, onions and hot peppers at no charge - made hosting a breeze. Definitely worth checking this place out!"}
