{"text":"Pete is the absolute best! So knowledgeable about the oysters, which are super fresh! Friendly, personable interaction and the \"real deal\" oyster tasting. Pete explained, in detail, each oyster we were tasting and what to pair it with. Absolutely awesome experience. If you love oysters, or just want a food adventure, check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"To circle back on what I wrote prior:  Service: much improved. The staff is much more comfortable in their rhythm. Still super friendly and chatty (the good kind, not the annoying kind).  Oysters: the selection has gotten much wider and they are very tasty. Also, they have some very reach happy hour hours during the week, where oysters that usually go for $19.50 a half dozen, for $1 or $2 each during HH. I don't remember when, but it's on some weekdays at least from 4-6pm (including Friday). They are damn good.   Also, their HH includes $2 off drinks. I love having bubbles with oysters and they have a pretty good selection.  They currently have a salmon salad (it's raw, FYI). It is a TON of fish per order despite how small it looks in the cup, so I would get one to share-- yes, share.  The only thing is I find the sauces they come don't really enhance the taste, so I just ask for lemon instead.  The main reason I come to Desoto Market is for this spot, and I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't remember our bartender guy but he was awesome. Service was so very attentive and had good conversation. The Tuna Poke we had was beautiful and tasted wonderful. I'm so glad I decided to give them a try - been eyeballing them since Desoto's opened and have been coming to the market for brunch regularly."}
{"text":"Attended the #nationaloysterday Oyster Tasting (with the drink pairing) at Walrus & the Pearl. My first time to DeSoto Central Market-- it's an awesome space with tons of potential. I wish it were busier!  Our tasting was excellent. One-bite appetizer, first course, oyster course, and last course. Everything was super-fresh and absolutely delicious. The chef and shucker were really knowledgeable and fun. I would absolutely come back just for the oyster happy hour! (I also added pics, which speak for themselves.)  Honestly, the only critique I would have is that the overall the service needs to work on its timing. I felt like diners at the tasting were often waiting around for the next plate to happen. Perhaps this is because it's still a relatively new space and is still working out the kinks.   Thanks for a fun time :)"}
{"text":"Cruised in on a holiday Saturday p.m. & they were empty. First time we'd seen more than one stool available so we saw our chance & grabbed some wood.  Very, very knowledgeable staff walk you through the diff types of oysters & pairings. So yummy & fun. I def recommend."}
{"text":"A small counter/bar with a clear view of the chef. We ordered 3 different types of Oysters with a side call of yellow tail poky! No disappointment with either. The Poky was dressed up in a simple rice base but it still had a delicate flavor. We accompanied our food with a Pale Ale and some champagne which did not suck. Our chef was attentive and laid back. The neo soul playing from his small bluetooth speaker added to the kick back ambiance. Simply put it was just what we needed a chill spot with no fuss and fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Walrus & The Pearl is set within the beautiful DeSoto Central Market just off Roosevelt and Central. It's hard to miss with its trademark logo (image of a walrus with the business name artfully inscribed within the form) and glorious displays of oysters!  Walrus & The Pearl is where I tasted my very first oyster of all time. I visited months and months ago with a friend who is proficient in such matters and she assured me that these oysters were some of the freshest around. I was not disappointed.  The oysters are beautiful and delicious, but the rest of the menu, though small and unassuming, shines equally as bright. The poke, in particular, is wonderfully delicious and surprisingly filling with a dash of spiciness to it as well (which I love!).  Considering the quality and portions of seafood sold at Walrus & The Pearl, I consider the prices to be very fair. I've also greatly appreciated the outstanding service I've experienced here every time I've made the drive down for a visit.  DeSoto is a really neat little market, rich with tasty options, but Walrus & The Pearl stands out as an easy favorite. Its setup is small yet intimate and would make a really great date spot (sure has for me, anyway!).  If you haven't been to Walrus & The Pearl yet and you find yourself in the area, I would strongly recommend a visit. Order the poke and a couple oysters - it'll make your day (or night). If you have questions about the menu, the staff is always more than happy to help.  Walrus & The Pearl Team: thank you for being so amazing, so knowledgeable, and so willing to help in every case I've needed it. You're doing a great job. I hope you're able to hang around for a good long time. :)"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Their oysters are fresh and they have a wonderful variety to choose from.  The $1 and $2 happy hour specials are a great value!  It's great watching the chef shuck right in front of you and I've seen him toss one or two that didn't meet his standards. We plant to go back when we get the chance!"}
{"text":"Really good experience on Friday night of a holiday weekend. We decided to stop by for some appetizers and a drink before heading out to dinner. I love the setting within Desoto market place. They have a small menu - oysters, oyster shooters, lobster roll, chowder, and tuna tartare (maybe one or two other items I can't think of). They also have a small selection of wine and craft beers. My husband and I sat at the bar and made conversation with the bartender/oyster shucker, who was super friendly despite being very busy. Oysters were good. Beer was cold. Lobster roll had a good amount of meat (although the meat to mayo ratio was a little off). I would love to come by for happy hour (looks like select oysters are on hh specials) and/or at a time when I can be a little more relaxed and just chill. It's not the best setting for a group since the bar has pretty limited seating. The seats are also backless stools, which aren't the most comfy - and there is no where to hang a purse or a coat. All in all- good place for a couple to stop for a drink or two and some oysters before ambling on for dinner..."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Amazing flavor.  Let's start off by saying happy hour 50% off oysters Mon-Tue (3-6pm).  It was my first visit and here is what I shove into my face:  1) 6 oysters (hand picked and freshly cut open by the chef) - pretty sweet flavor and quality.  2) Poke Bowl Scottish Salmon - guys seriously the crispy rice has unicorn magic  or something, I know it doesn't sound like anything special, but it is super good. lol  3) local IPA beer, well...its beer. It was great :)  Enjoy your visit!"}
{"text":"I loved the vibe of this place in the Desoto Marketplace. I'm not a huge fan of oysters but the friends I was with said they were amazing. The lobster mac n cheese was sooooo good!   Would definitely return :-)"}
{"text":"I have been scouring the valley for a decent lobster roll after a recent trip to the Hamptons and luckily my quest has finally proved fruitful.   Walrus & The Pearl is a small food counter within the Desoto Market on Roosevelt Row. I don't know how long it's been operating but I'm happy to have found it. We hopped on our bikes and rode over immediately after coming upon a rumor that there was a fantastic oyster bar here.  We tried several oysters, they range from 2-3.25 and are flown in daily. They are served with lemon and some mignonette. It's a small menu, oysters, bubbly, wine and a few other rotating dishes.   The wild north Atlantic lobster roll was perfection, spicy, delicious but a little small. The person working the counter let us in on a tip: on Friday's the lobster roll goes for 8$. This is an unbelievable price and I will be stopping here weekly before setting off on a downtown adventure.   We also tried the spicy yellowfin tuna tartare which is served with a miso sauce. I wish that more places would emulate this lobster roll and not try to fancy them up with unneeded twists that no one is asking for. I realize this is more of an east coast sandwich but I'm glad that someone is getting it right."}
{"text":"The oysters here are a big draw, and for good reasons: they are very fresh, different varieties are offered on different days, and the happy hour prices are great ($1 oysters on Monday and Tuesday). I tried a half-dozen each of Paradise and Fanny Bay oysters, two of the 3 varieties offered on the Tuesday that I came here. I tried them plain as well as with the mignonette and freshly-grated horseradish; either way, they were delicious and pleasantly briny. The place is tucked in a little area near the stairway inside DeSoto Central Market. The design elements are minimal, but for me that just adds to the comfortable informal vibe."}
{"text":"Say hello to the newest of DeSoto Central Market's creations.  An oyster bar serving a pretty wide variety of seafoods.  They were a little late in joining the DeSoto family, but finally came into the fold on May 9th, 2015.  Having sampled all of DeSoto's other creations, I figured I'd give this place a shot.  I should preface this review by saying that my rating is closer to a 3.5, but I'm rounding up largely because of Chef Pete.  Super classy guy who answered pretty much all of my questions and explained his rotating menu (though he didn't give up all his trade secrets).  The prices are such that I can't give this place a super high mark yet, but my first visit gives me plenty of reason to be hopeful of this new upstart.  Among the items on Walrus & The Pearl's food menu include different types of oysters, shrimps, as well as other fish species.  Among the menu items that caught my attention during my first visit here was their pokes.  I've heard of poke (pronounced po-kay for those unfamiliar), which I know is huge in Hawaii and parts of Asia, but I've never sampled it for myself.  Essentially pokes are small bowls of raw fish that are covered with sea salt and an array of various marinades.  Today I decided to have a Yellowfin Tuna Poke.  The menu doesn't mention what was in the poke other than the tuna, so I did my best to figure it out on my own.  Aside from sea salt, I picked up sriracha, lemon juice, pepper, parsley, and scallions.  Might've been a few other items in there, but that's what I could make out.  The portion was fairly modest (though plenty for lunch), but about what I expected based on seeing poke dishes on the Food Network.  Overall, I was a big fan of this dish.  The sriracha gave it a little bit of a kick without being too spicy and the tuna tasted good enough to be sushi grade (who knows, maybe it was).  I also got a glass of the Pinor Noir.  I was pretty happy as I was the first one to have their Pinot Noir so they opened the bottle in front of me.  Refreshing accompaniment to the poke for sure.  So back to the drawback of this place.  The prices.  Total tab for the poke, glass of Pinot Noir, tax and tip came to $35.  Granted, I ordered one of the more expensive wines on their list.  But still, $15 for a glass of wine is pretty steep.  Most of their drink offerings are around $10 or less so don't let my experience scare you off on that front.  The prices of the seafood items themselves pretty much vary on which type of seafood you get and how much of it.  And as I mentioned earlier, the food menu rotates depending on what they have available so bear that in mind.  Taken as a whole, Walrus & the Pearl has promise.  It remains to be seen whether this oyster bar/seafood restaurant concept can work when there are much cheaper offerings at DeSoto, but its certainly worth a try.  As mentioned Chef Pete is a super friendly guy and has been an apprentice of famed valley chef Stephen Jones (i.e. Blue Hound Kitchen, Yard Bird, etc.), so he's got the lineage to succeed.  Hopefully he's able to work out the menu to a price point that will make his oyster bar a regular mainstay for Downtown lunch and dinner crowds.  After all, taking risks are pretty much what every aspiring restauranteur at DeSoto is here to do."}
{"text":"Very tasty! We had the Malpeque oysters and a lobster roll that were quite delicious. Cool location, great food - I highly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I've only had oysters a handful of times. So I won't be the best at rating the flavor but damn I had an experience here. My server/oyster chucker Blake was amazing at giving me advice and profiles about the selection he had for the day, from texture to salinity rating to sweetness. I came on Monday, which was slow but great! They do half off select oysters. I'll be back to try the lobster roll. Oysters plus a cucumber sour beer before a Monday meeting,  I'll take every week."}
{"text":"My favorite on Tuesday's happy hour since some of their selection of oysters are half off. Parking and the downtown area in general may seem daunting to a lot of people but they have parking in the back and adjacent lot by the church as long as you don't park where its marked. I usually grab a pitcher of beer and chill here with the friendly staff when they're not super busy shucking and taking orders. The shooters are super good as well as the cocktail shrimps which are consistent. As far as the oysters go that'll be caveat emptor since they're all different and change but I can vouch that every oyster I've picked was delicious and fresh tasting!"}
{"text":"Coming from NE, I've had many a lobster roll. But damn! For the price and taste you can't beat it. 12$ for a lobster roll after 3 on a Friday, unheard of. I will say that their rolls are uniquely different from the OG. Wherein lobster rolls from NE are made with a small amount if mayo, lemon, and lettuce, Walrus using an herb aoili which packs a flavor punch. While it does take away slightly the lobster flavor, it is a refreshing twist on a NE classic. All in all, I'm satisfried."}
{"text":"We stopped in last weekend to enjoy a drink at the bar and were hoping to have some shrimp cocktail as well, but no such luck on the weekend!  My rose sparkling wine was perfect and a great prelude to our amazing dinner at the Larder and the Delta.  Everyone that sat down next to us raved about the oysters, so if that is your thing definitely come and check it out."}
{"text":"Cute place inside DeSoto Central Market...the seafood is outstanding for AZ!"}
{"text":"This place in Desoto Market made my month! Watching them shuck delicious oysters right in front of you is so refreshing and not to mention reminiscent of being in Seattle. They have my beloved Kumamoto oysters (that are the most expensive) but are so worth it. During happy hour they have oysters for a dollar a piece. I actually came here the first time, after being to a few other places in Desoto, for National Oyster Day and they did not disappoint! I went to Little Cleos last year, and was so sad that by 6 pm they had run out of oysters.   Thanks guys for being awesome and giving me a good dozen! Will be back for the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I live downtown and have eaten at Desoto off and on but never tried Walrus and the Pearl until tonight. We had the lobster roll, shrimp cocktail, two oyster shooters, some champagne, and a beer. All were excellent! Friendly service and great food. And we hear they gave great happy hour specials. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good thing the Walrus has a pearl because this is a tiny gem! Located in the DeSoto market, this small stand has excellent fare. They have a nice little wine list. I enjoyed a red blend but while I was there, a number of people ordered a bubbly pink. I'll give it a try next time. They had a yellowfin tuna poke bowl special that I ordered. It was amazing; very flavorful. Blake was our chef and server and I have to give him a shout-out also. He's warm and friendly and gave a great description of the various menu choices. I sat at the bar and was able to watch him cook. The lobster roll looks amazing as does the spicy shrimp tempura roll. Looks like they do a daily special so I'll visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Shane was extremely knowledgeable about oysters. He suggested a rose champagne pairing that was a perfect compliment to my choices. The oyster selection was stellar and fresh. The shucking was done perfectly, there were no gritty pieces or shells. I loved the mignonette to top the oysters. I definitely have to come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here tonight excited to eat some fish. 1.5 hours later and several very rude staff members later I still have no fish. Maybe tomorrow when I get the meal I can update you all on how it tasted."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Delicious sashimi. Wonderful oysters! Thank you, Shane! You're a bad-a mother-shucker"}
{"text":"SO. GOOD!  My friends and I have been coming by DeSoto more and more recently, and this place is always my jam. Particularly for the poke - the rice is slightly crispy, the fish is fresh, and the sauce is great!  I've also had oysters/shooters here. I'm not much of a connoisseur, but they've all been fantastic as well.   They also have a great wine selection! I'd recommend the sauv blanc or sparkling rose."}
{"text":"Can't complain about fresh oysters in a desert.  We spoke to the new guy there who was super friendly and knew a lot about their different oysters.  They seem like they usually have 6 or so different kinds and you can mix and match however many you want.  We had six of some of the most unique tasting oysters I've ever had.  Apparently something called a pea crab craws in their gills and lives in them, so when the oyster is shucked and eaten, you get an additional pop of flavor from the crab as well.  I definitely recommend trying it while you can!  They have happy hour on Tuesdays where the oysters are half off.  I'm definitely going to come back for that!"}
{"text":"I love poke so that's what I ordered. It was warm. That is different to me, but good nonetheless. I could do with more fish and less rice, but taste wise it was excellent! The rice is almost sushi rice, fried rice, and steak rice all at once. It's neither and it's good, or at least different. A must try of you are used to the cold fish, no ride, traditional poke.  Oh and bonus, the Pinot for $5 was really good, and I'm not a Pinot girl"}
{"text":"Great place in desoto market. The oysters are fresh and the poke bowls are great too! Wonderful service."}
{"text":"Cant rate the food because I didn't  get to eat. Went is on a Sat after the ball game. Nothing on the menu available except oysters, no biggie I wanted oysters. One person working we sat there for 10 minutes never hi guys be with shortly, what will you have we are out **********. so  after 10 minutes of being ignored we got up and went to another restaurant. I get busy I don't get poor service. Oh the oysters are $3.50 each yes $42.00 a dozen!"}
{"text":"I saw a previous good review on yelp about this restaurant. I myself am not a big oyster fan but my husband loves them so we decided to give it a try. He order an assortment plate of the oysters and liked most of them . We also ordered 2 lobster rolls which were delicious, the brioche bread  was awesome! The clam chowder is really good & Tempura shrimp roll . Over all everything we ordered was very good . We would definitely go back. What I didn't know was this restaurant is inside of the DeSoto central market which I also didn't know that there are about four other little restaurants in there , they all looked interesting and we will definitely go back and try some of the another restaurants as well"}
{"text":"We had no expectations - just had read on the plane that Roosevelt Row was a place to check out - but we were blown away. 20 years in Seattle, but these were some of the best oysters. THEN we went to the seaweed salad. I don't recall ever having seaweed salad, but my wife has. Best either of us have ever had. We finished with two types of himachi - one with fennel, citrus and jalapeño, the other with a tomatillo finish. Exquisite! Oh, and the Chablis was grand as well. Plus staff were awesome."}
{"text":"Big Mike!!! Thank you so much for the wonderful care & attention. My niece and I had a blast sitting at the oyster bar, ordering up a storm, and having good conversation with a really nice guy. The oysters were sooo fresh, it was amazing. I was skeptical at first bc its Arizona.. for seafood? and this place definitely blew my mind.  The Sunsets were our favorite but they were all pretty delicious. We also had the popcorn shrimp which have an added flare of actual popcorn and pickles.   I have to try the lobster roll next time!"}
{"text":"Oyster lovers, rejoice!  As here you will find some of the best shucked Oysters, varieties hailing from New Zealand and BC, East Coast and West Coast, briny or salty, sweet and petite.  On my recent visit, I sampled all of the 7 varieties. Kumamotos from Humboldt Bay, Coromandels from New Zealand, Eld Inlets from Washington, Misty Points from Virginia, Kumiais from California, Miyagis from Puget Sounds, and Kaiparas from New Zealand.  A more eclectic and delightful combination of oysters I have never had.  They were perfect with W&P's cocktail sauce and shaved horseradish.  The spicy tuna tartare was pure heaven, nestled on a spicy citrus avocado mousse, and for $8 it was a fantastic price.   The oysters varieties vary in price, but during Happy Hour they are $1 and $2.  I believe hours are Mon-Thurs 3-6 - and the occasional Friday night when there is an overabundance of these beauties.  This will be my destination for oysters forevermore!!!! Finally, the ocean feels a bit closer.  Be aware that there is only bar seating at this cozy oyster bar, and raw seafood can only be consumed at the bar. So timing here is everything :)"}
{"text":"The oysters were fantastic. And the chef recommended some very delicious stuff for us to eat. I really enjoyed it. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the food places inside Desoto Central Market.   Loved sitting at the counter and watching them shuck my oysters. So many selections, so fresh, so many sauces.   They have happy hour too."}
{"text":"Best oysters I've ever had!! Great service! We had oyster shots which we were told the mix had been made that morning. The vinegar mix for the oysters were beyond delicious. Also made in house :) we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had the yellowfin tuna poke bowl made by a young man named Blake and it was DELICIOUS!! It was loaded with fish and rice. Their poke bowls are half off on Saturday so I got my bowl for only 8 dollars. I highly recommend this place! Clean, nice staff and wonderful, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Yelp said they open at Noon but we were here at 1pm and no one was in sight. We waited around a bit and asked one of the busboys walking around and he said they opened at 2. We walked around some shops along the street, even checking out some of the food trucks parked at the Public Market, came back at 2:06pm and still, no one in sight! We asked the busboy again and he then said it opened at 3?!?! W-T-F?!?!!!! This was very disappointing especially since we came here specifically for this place (we're visiting from LA, so it's not like we're locals and can come back another time).   Get your sh!t together and update your hours for your patrons that actually want to try your food!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The staff was so great and accommodating! Great oysters and awesome price on Maine lobster rolls like I haven't seen in the valley before! Will definitely be back for great food and service!"}
{"text":"I love that I can finally get fresh oysters shucked right in front of me in downtown phoenix! They offer a wide variety of oysters from the Pacific Northwest so far, all of which are priced fairly considering they are being shipped to the desert. They also have great happy hour prices on their oysters ranging from $1-2 per oyster! This is a very welcome and exciting addition to the market!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little place in a local shared food court. I sat at the bar and had a half dozen Manaspina oysters. At $3 a piece - a little pricey and not quite as good as some Gulf Oysters, but still very fresh and good to eat. I also had a Lobster roll. It was, as others have advertised, better than many New England Lobster Rolls. The roll was really good and the meat fresh out of the shell. At $17 it was decently priced if not a little high for the amount of actual meat, but we are on the west coast with an east coast delicacy after all. The staff, a waitress and the chef, were both extremely personable and we had a few great conversations - which is always welcome when I am traveling alone."}
{"text":"Being from the Pacific NW I have say the oysters from this place are the best quality and tasting I've found in the desert.  Shane loves his trade and is proud of the product here.  Get place to go for oysters in Phx."}
{"text":"I recently came to the Market for dinner to visit with a friend who lives in town. I love the concept of the venue and have been to a similar set up in New York, but this one was just missing something. The place was literally a ghost town on a Saturday night which I found very strange. Maybe if they had some more restaurants or live music? I'm not sure what would help, but I worry about this place staying in business much longer.  As for the food I had the lobster roll which came with a side of chips. The roll itself was super small and not all too flavorful. Certainly not anywhere near the best I've ever had. The chips were just alright too, nothing special.  I can't say I'd come back to this location or this particular stand again. It seemed very over priced for what it was and just didn't wow me in any way."}
{"text":"Sean is awsome your go to person go on Monday or Tuesday half priced oysters  the company u share will be great as well. Happy people are oyster people...do go and enjoy they are there at least 6 days  week"}
{"text":"Excellent yellowfin tuna poke bowl half off on a Saturday night.  Perfect with a glass of wine or a beer (good selection of both) after a show downtown.  Plus, they're in the DeSoto Market where you have a choice of different mini- restaurants to choose from - like a food court, only with way better food choices!"}
{"text":"I am huge fan of Desoto and the communal space they have created. We were here for brunch on a very rainy Sunday at around 2pm. I went to Walrus & The Pearl to order clam chowder (I had just seen it on Desoto's instagram) and they told me it takes around 5 hours to prepare.5 hours!  Sooooooo we ate at Radish which was great."}
{"text":"Omg. The best!! Everything was explained so well. The customer service and the food were a 10! Oysters were fresh and delish! Leah was so sweet and Blake made sure I understood exactly what I was getting so I could remember what to order next time. Definitely a yes for Desoto!"}
{"text":"Well, this is disappointing because I was very much looking forward to celebrating my anniversary night. I thought some good food and bachata dance lessons all in one place would be great! The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the gentlemen behind the counter were friendly. The \"manager\" if that's what she was, could have been more friendly, not voiced that the wine they keep in stock was \"not that great.\" She also made sure to take up the only table that said \"reserved for Walrus and the Pearl customers\" to do her work. Given, there are plenty of other tables to choose from, this specific one was more quaint and separated from the other parts of the open floor, which would have been nice since we were celebrating. We never received food menus and had to ask for a drink menu. We were basically told we had options of oysters, tuna poke bowl and lobster roll. The lobster roll was supposed to be on special for $12 but I later seen I was charged $14 and the roll was more bread than anything. The poke bowl should've been named rice, tuna with avocado chunks, no dressings, or ginger available and forget any other toppings. Tuna was warm for some reason. I wouldn't recommend especially after seeing the guy shucking oysters grab the lemons with his bare hands while maneuvering other devices in and out of the kitchen. I should've listened to the other lady that left the same review. I wouldn't waste my time ever again. I've attached the photo but don't let the image fool you, the bowl is a lot smaller than it appears. The one good thing I can say is there was a decent amount of tuna but would've expected more toppings for $16."}
{"text":"Great Oysters!  Nice atmosphere.  A very small Oyster bar in a nice and much bigger building with other food businesses.  Pete, the chef, was terrific.  I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"The lobster rolls are better than the lobster rolls I got in Maine this summer! So tasty I want to eat here every Friday! I'"}
{"text":"Stopped by at the DeSoto Central Market for some fresh oysters!! 50% of Fanny Bay Oysters from BC!! Very fresh and very yummy!!! Great price!!"}
{"text":"We finally came here when it was open. The special was Moroccan shrimp with rice and butter toast. We love Moroccan food so this was a winning dish."}
{"text":"I really, really hate to give a single star, but due to our experience yesterday night it's a must. And, hopefully management will implement some new, more sanitary methods of food preparation at this establishment.   Amidst the dull atmosphere of the rest of the complex, we were looking forward to enjoying some oysters at the Walrus bartop. They are all on display, so it was a plus to get to see the freshness first hand. However, we noticed the individual prepping the oysters went from shucking them, to serving them, to touching his phone, to walking to other areas of the complex and back - all without washing his hands and putting any gloves on before more food prep. This is unacceptable and after seeing this we decided to leave and cancel our food order as were were NOT going to risk getting sick from food prepared with sanitary carelessness. Phones, which have a considerable amount of bacteria/fecal matter on them should not be allowed in food prep areas. Handwashing is not an option and gloves area a must!! I cannot stress that enough!! MANAGEMENT - this is a huge liability, especially working with seafood!  This review is not meant to say anything negative about the friendliness of the sole individual working the Walrus food space. He was nice and wanted to be helpful but MANAGEMENT - it would be wise to implement sanitary procedures. If this is what we saw with our own eyes, I'm literally scared to know how food is prepped when we don't see it!!  Patrons beware. And, as always, for the protection of each other, if you see something, say something. We all have a responsibility to help protect each other."}
{"text":"Reasons to come here: 1- it's a part of DeSotto Market, which is a pretty cool spot filled with several tasty options and plenty of space to hang 2- fresh oysters! Yum! Prices vary depending what kind, but you can count on $1 oysters m-t 3-6pm and $2 oysters w-f 3-6pm 3- the people who work here are pretty legit. I don't always know which oysters to order so they'll explain brininess and size. And they'll recommend some if you ask 4- speaking of happy hour ... $2 off wines and $1 beers. That makes the sparkling rose only $6! 5- clam chowda. Yup. Get it.   Reasons why I'm not giving it a 5th star (if I could do 4.5, I def would!) 1- if you order here, they prefer you eat here. That's tough when you're with a group and they have limited bar seating 2- speaking of bar seating .. The seats are stools and don't have backs. It's not the most comfy thing to sit on long term 3- while the people are super friendly, they're normally pretty busy. You normally have to ask for more napkins, refills on water, etc. (hey I'm really stingy about that 5th star!) 4- parking can be tricky. There's a lot next door, but sometimes the gate is closed. There's a small lot across the alley and metered street parking (the kind that don't take credit cards)"}
{"text":"Went here because my wife loves seafood and overall it was highly rated.   I've been to DeSoto Central Market a few times, so I knew it would be a small counter-styled restaurant.  However, we walked past because no one was behind the counter and there were only two oysters being displayed among the two huge \"troughs\" of ice behind the glass on the counter.  Plus, there really isn't a menu displayed.  We grabbed a beer across the way and came back - there was an employee there.  She told us she doesn't normally work at Walrus & The Pearl, but works one of the other restaurants owned by the same company within DeSoto.  One draw was happy hour oysters, no luck... only one oyster available - confusing because its an oyster bar????  They were $3.50 each and very large and good, but only one offering for an oyster bar - still confused.  My wife and I shared the rock shrimp ceviche and the oyster po' boy.  Both were good, but overall this place is just not polished enough for what they charge.  The girl working was very nice and we had good conversation but seemed to lack experience and knowledge.  She did mention to us that someone who previously worked there ordered all different type of oysters, so they had a good selection but not much now and they were still \"experimenting\" with things.  This was our first time, but it appears the restaurant has been around a while based on reviews.  Based on my experience, I can understand how this restaurant's ratings continue to dip.  I feel the place can be great, but needs some help - quickly.  Because the food was good, I'll give it a three.  But.... take advantage of the fact that Lil' Cleo's has closed and pull some of that customer base - do better Mr Walrus and Mrs Pearl."}
{"text":"Absolutely cute place within Desoto's, and delicious Oysters. By far the best tasting Oysters I've ever had, we tried two different Oyster choices both were yummy!   Service: Shane was amazing and super friendly, we sat and ate and talked with Shane the entire meal.    If you love Oysters, or looking to try this is a must go to place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get Oysters in Phoenix. The Mission Oysters where the best!  The sushi is also amazing, I had the shrimp tempura and it was awesome. Go here at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Being from Brittany, France, this place is the little gem in the desert. Absolutely amazing food. Had the oysters, chilled to perfect temperature with an outstanding mignonette. The Salmon, also amazing ,soft, buttery, served with a creamy Caesar homemade dressing over grilled romaine leafs. The recommended wine \"Madness & Cures\" was chilled also to perfection.  Thank you for an amazing lunch experience  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Took an Uber all the way over here to find them closed. Yelp and Google both showed them open. Update your hours!"}
{"text":"Sit at the counter and watch your oysters and clams shucked before your eyes. Nice assortment and very fresh. Mignonette is spot on and the cocktail sauce is a best ever. Happy hour Mon and Tues."}
{"text":"The food and service were great. It was a little of wait, but nothing crazy. We had a oysters and the poke bowl. The poke bowl rice was so good and the avocado added so much to the bowl. I will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"The oyster selection! Great service, great oysters, and a great city market feel. It was a little bit pricey for a dozen oysters and a cheap glass of champagne but I enjoyed the experience."}
