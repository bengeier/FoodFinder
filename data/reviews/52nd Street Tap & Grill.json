{"text":"I thought that I'd finally try this place after passing by it fairly often. Once you walk inside, you realize this place is a lot bigger than it seems from outside. It's very much a sports bar with several big-screen tv's, darts, and others games. There's also a large open area which I imagine could be used for a band or dancing.  Most of the usual bar food suspects are on the menu: burgers, wings, nachos, etc... I just went for wings. I guess since I came when the just opened that perhaps the fryer was just being turned on. I wasn't warned and the wings took over a half hour to arrive when there was barely anyone else inside. They're really your typical run-of-the mill hot wings. Okay, but nothing to write home about and the 'hot' was way too mild. They came with fries which is good value, but those were also average being clearly packaged and frozen. I'd venture to guess that most of the food is basic too. Probably the type of food and preparation you'd get at a Boston Pizza.  Good place to catch a game, but don't expect to have a 'gastropub' experience. The pizzas are said to be maid to order however, cooked in a stone oven - so maybe there's promise there."}
{"text":"Not a great beer list. Horrific food. Pizza was soggy. Wrong twice. The wings were also wrong from our order. Drinks were over priced and expensive. I would never return."}
{"text":"Great place to party, with a big bar lots of tables and a big dance floor complete with DJ lighting and a booming speaker system everything you need to party the night away. The food was really good as well had a great time there"}
{"text":"Tips for success: if you're the owner of the restaurant, don't catcall women from the patio of said restaurant. It is disgusting, and it ruined any chance of me, or any of my coworkers ever returning there. While you and your disgusting friends were whistling at three women walking a dog across the street, your customers, my friend and I, who are two women who have battled sexism working in an engineering career, were trying to enjoy a nice dinner on a work trip. It didn't help when I looked over your friends we're looking right back at us almost in pride: \"look! My ignorant friend objectified women 150' away and I only hang out with him because he gives us cheap alcohol, doesn't that make us so manly?\"  You should seriously reconsider the way you look at life and women. Bums on the street are the ones that typically catcall, it's no surprise that you are single in what looks like you're in your +50s and hang out at bars treating women the way you do, catcalling women, it's gross.   No, switching out our chairs for comfy ones, or giving us free mediocre cheese cake at the end, trying to mend from your appalling behavior, doesn't fix anything. You need to fix yourself.   Not related to the rating: I had the fajitas, gross and maybe 5 pieces of small burnt meat, tortillas were hard and stale. Mojito was straight from a mix, yeah they put some \"homegrown\" mint in it, but it was still not great. My friend's burger and beer was good. If you go here, god knows why, stick to the simple menu items. Stuff that can't be screwed up. The female bartender/server was nice and really sweet."}
