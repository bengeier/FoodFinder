{"text":"Food *** - Service *** - Ambience ****

Fairly mediocre food. Their curries are palatable but no matter what curry you off of their menu, they all taste the same. At $10 a curry, and for that portion size, they are fairly over priced. The ambience and staff are ok. Restaurant is quite clean.

I would go back here if I had no other options."}
{"text":"I was with two friends for a nice Sunday lunch. The food was decent. Not the best Indian food I have had but good. We all found things we liked and the food was good. We would go back if we were in the area again. 

 What really got me was the price of the drinks, not alcoholic, but Coke and ginger ale. I had 2 glasses of Coke and one person had 2 glasses ginger ale. We each had two thinking that it was free refills. We were shocked to see we had drink nine dollars in coke and ginger ale which likely came from a fountain drink system."}
{"text":"Chef of India seems to be the only surviving Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood considering there used to be 5+ less than a year ago.  The food and overall selection is solid.  They have lots of veggie options and are pretty consistent on a return visitor basis. I'm a big fan of their lunch buffet takeout.  For approx $11 (tax in) you can walk out with a huge amount of fresh food.

Decor is nice and the staff is friendly.  I have never seen this place full or particularly busy, but it would make a nice place for an evening out."}
{"text":"Food is terribly bland with little flavour and no spice. The decor is dated and the not very clean. At least the staff was friendly. it only gets busy because it's cheap and there aren't very many alternatives around."}
{"text":"I work not too far from this restaurant and decided to pop in on one of my days off. I was disappointed  to say the least. This place looks nice and clean in the inside, I was greeted and seated in the timely manner. Unfortunately the food was not what I expected. I ordered the mixed vegetable biryani and a  mixed veggie dish.The mixed vegetable biryani taste was off,it did not have much indian spices and the mixed vegetable was alright but again not much indian spices and was not flavourful as well."}
{"text":"I live right by this place and steered clear of it for months fearful that it would live down to the standards of the average Indian buffet priced at $12. Two weeks ago I decided to take the plunge and honestly not outstanding but it certainly outperformed my admittedly low standards. If you don't want to head too far south and are in the Yonge and St. Clair vicinity this actually makes for fairly good value for money - I'd go again, good for the price. A la carte may not be so attractive"}
{"text":"Jaaadu was transformed sometime this year into a second location of Chef of India. Jaaadu was well-loved and I think Chef of India will be a worthy replacement, I don't know what the background story is, but my impression was better than the reviews for the other Chef of India location.

Chef of India was up there with the best Indian food I've had in Toronto. Two words are all you need here, Malai Kofta. Their version of the amazing fried spiced paneer and raisin balls absolutely floored me. The kofta were absolutely perfect and served in a delicious korma sauce which left my belly in a state of complete and muttar bliss.  I also got to try the Chicken Danshak, which I've never seen anywhere else and it was decent and wonderfully spicy, but not one I would order again, too many other classic dishes to try.

I always try the mango lassi when I'm checking out a new restaurant, and Chef of India made the best one I've had outside of House of Curries in Berkeley, CA, which is steep praise. Their naan was a little buttery, but fluffy and absolutely delicious.

It was a little pricey, but the food was definitely a cut above most establishments, and I like that they serve classic dishes in a classic style. They have a buffet, though I don't have the details. I'm definitely going to check it out soon though."}
{"text":"Best fish tikka ever!!  If we were judging this place on the fish tikka alone it would definitely be 5*. Everything else is absolutely yummy, fresh and delish. No downside - even the service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been to Chef of India may times in the past. This restaurant is located above a salon and it's in a great location.

Upon walking in, you're greeted by a kind worker who seats you in the dimmed-lighted, nicely decorated restaurant. The restaurant has soft Indian instrumental music playing, and deep colors that put you to ease. It's pretty clean and spacious too, but there aren't a lot of people there most of the time.

While looking through the menu, you're given complimentary papadums to snack on. The menu consists of appetizers, soups, and Indian meat, vegetarian and seafood delicacies. They also have many rice and bread options, chutney's, desserts and drinks such as lassi and mango juice. 

The food has generally been good. Once in a while you feel like you're eating re-heated food. The naan bread is a hit and miss- sometimes it's great, and other times it's too flaky and hard. The portions are good but can be better, and it's a little pricey. Also, The dessert menu consists of ras-malai (sweet cheese balls drowned in sugared cream), gulab jamun (fried milk balls in sugar syrup), kulfi (Indian ice-cream), masala tea (spiced Indian tea with milk) and more. The dessert portions are tiny and overpriced, but they're delicious!

I love masala tea; I live on it! The masala tea here is good but once again, the amount you get can be better. This tea is made and put in a small tea-pot for you, and comes with a small cup. However, there have been times where my husband and I have ordered the tea, and they gave us that little pot that is for one person and tell us to share it. That would be fine if they didn't charge us for two teas! The tea is expensive too- $3.50 each for such a small amount. 

Furthermore, the service here is good, but it comes to the point of feeling awkward and uncomfortable. The servers are constantly watching you, refilling your water after each sip, did I mention watching you? My friends and I always walk out saying \"did you see that? They were staring at us the whole time!\" Once, the waiter even walked all the way across the restaurant and fixed my napkin on my lap without saying a word...awkward!

Overall, this is an okay restaurant. I rather eat somewhere else that offers reasonably priced food, larger potions and without feeling awkward. Now, I just walk 4 min east of this restaurant to another Indian restaurant called Banjara- my ultimate favourite Indian place! It's hard to recommend Chef of India since there is a better Indian restaurant only 4 minutes away."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's definitely not my favorite Indian buffet. The food doesn't seem too fresh and there's not a lot of variety. However the restaurant itself is very spacious and I especially love the window seats where you can look down to the street. Price is reasonable and service is great. I would go back only because it's right around the corner and I'm too lazy to go downtown."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable - friendly and attentive.  Best samosas I've ever had... served on a bed of chickpeas and smothered in some kind of deliciousness.  We ordered butter chicken, mattar paneer, rice and naan.  The food was pretty good... a little heavy, but satisfied our craving.  We recommend."}
{"text":"This is THE-PLACE-TO-GO... if you like Tandoori bones !!! They also have Goat bones in curry and beef bones !!!  mmmmm...mmmmm....   but... there is a caveat... they ration the Tandoori bones so only a few are released into the buffet each half an hour or so... you better keep guard right next to the serving tray because they go fast !!!

This is the #1 meeting spot for Paleontologists and Archaeologists in Toronto and the surrounding areas...

Oh... and there was this one time when I was standing in line at the buffet and this clown in black shirt just cut in line and bumped me! oh... and there was also that time while I was working for another client, that there was a couple making the sex there...

The only positive is the people in costume...(I would go back just for that reason)"}
{"text":"The service was good, prompt, and polite. Great location @ y&eg the one and only gripe i have with this place is the food is kind of bland for indian food. It wasn't bad by any means, just a little underwhelming. It would be a bit more appropriate for someone with a sensitive palette, but I'm the kind of person who likes his indian food spicy and packed with flavour. There are a few things they can do to get some easy points which is why I'm giving a score of 3. More sauces, chutneys, and general flavour options. Adjust the heat lamps to not dry out the food, I could cut a potato with my naan, just a little too crispy. Other than that the experience was pleasant and I probably will go back because it was adequately priced."}
{"text":"The best butter chicken I've had in a very long time! The staff is great, too. My husband and I came in to order take-out recently and were offered a seat at the bar with some papadum to tide us over while we waited. We eat here as often as we can!"}
{"text":"The food in this restaurant is not authentic Indian cuisine, at least not in my experience. Korma coconut curry tasted excessively sugary and the eggplant curry was dripping in oil and did not have any flavor. The curries did not have the deep aromatic taste of spices that you would expect in a curry.

The waiter was rather impatient, visiting us three times in a short intervals despite we were still not decided.

Moreover, the price did not match the quality of the dishes. I would not say that it was too much if the dishes had been tasty, but they were not.

Chef of India is definitely the worst Indian restaurant I have even been to. Do not be fooled by the outward look and good location."}
{"text":"I've eaten way too much Indian and Thai food for one lifetime, but I ain't slowing down. Nice staff; large but comfy seating, tasty lassis.
Sometimes their pakoras are a bit dry but baingon bhurta, malai kofta, saag paneer? Super yummy!!
Wish their chai was a liiiittle bit thicker/creamier like in India :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking one night. From what I could see outside I was hesitant to walk in but am very glad that I did. 

The food was outstanding. I ordered a Mango Lassi which was one of the better ones that I have had. My favorite dishes were the Butter Chicken, the Garlic Na'an, and the lamb. The chicken and lamb were both tender and the sauces for both dishes for very flavorful. 

i would highly suggest anyone travelling through Toronto to stop and eat."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday, every dish we ordered except the biriyani was sweet. Think the chef got his/her salt and sugar mixed up. It was overly sweet and completely put us off the food. Nothing great...especially for that price. If that quality came with a more reasonable price tag it would have got a more favourable rating. Didnt enjoy it..will likely avoid it again if i can"}
{"text":"This is a decent place for indian buffet.  I have only gone for lunch.  The food is pretty fresh.  My favorite is the egg plant.  The chola (chick peas), and daal (lentils) are also very tasty.  The tandoor is naan is quite nice also.  For under 12 bucks for a wide variety of items this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Such a shame.  My family and I have eaten in and gotten delivery several times, as we always enjoy the food here.  This weekend, we ordered delivery.  A lady called to get directions and berated us for living so far.  She resumed her disparaging comments at the door, reiterating that we shouldn't be ordering from them because of where we live.   We called to advise the manager about this experience.  He restated that we live too far for them to deliver food.  Why accept an order for over $100 if you don't want the business? Lots of great places for Indian food in the city.  We will try somewhere new."}
{"text":"We went to Chef of India restaurant yesterday evening. Such a lovely place. Ordered Malai kebab as appetizer. It was so moist and delicious. For main we had Beef Vindaloo, Butter Chicken, Saag paneer, Garlic Naan and pulao rice. Everything was really good. we loved the food and service."}
{"text":"I go to Chef of India about once a month. Its pretty good. I like their lunch buffet. Lots of people that work in the area. The service is good, the servers are very friendly and polite. I enjoy the sag paneer, butter chicken, eggplant curry, and tandoori chicken. My favourite here is their eggplant curry its very nice, its tasty. They also serve food that is quite fresh compared to other buffets I have seen."}
{"text":"Nice, fresh food (a la carte - didn't try the buffet).  As some others noted, not as spicy as many Indian places can be, but I see that as a plus, the dishes are very flavourful, not blow your face off hot.  If you sit up front you can watch the hustle bustle of Yonge and Eglinton walking by.  The a la carte dishes are reasonably priced for the area - about 11, 12 dollars per dish.  Portions could be a bit bigger.  We'll be back, might try the lunch buffet next time."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of indian buffets... I prefer to order a la carte. However, this is one of the better indian buffet spots in the city. 

Some of my favourites include: aloo gobi, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, galab jamun and chana masala."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time.  I'm of North Indian descent and my husband is of South Indian descent.  We were there with our two teenaged children and my parents-in-law.  Everyone agreed the meal was incredible.  Very flavourful without being spicy, nicely presented, and very good service - attentive but not overbearing.

The meal started with pappadum.  Normally I don't like pappadum but these were incredible.  Somehow fluffy and not greasy and served with a lovely spicy-tomato slaw, very similar to salsa.

There were 6 of us and we ordered samosa, tandoori platter, lamb rogan josh, vegetable korma, bhagani bhartha, and saag paneer.  We accompanied with 2 orders of naan - one garlic and one regular - and 2 orders of rice.  Overall it was too much food and definitely too much rice.  We were happy to bring leftovers home.

The samosa came first and none of us had seen the presentation before.  Two samosas with channa and a little bit of yogurt and tamarind sauce.  It was so pleasing and delicious.

The dishes were expertly cleared and the table re-set with large entree plates and then the remaining dishes came.  There was a set of accompanying sauces - mint chutney, a raita-yogurty sauce, and tamarind sauce.  My mother makes mint chutney from scratch from fresh mint she grows in her garden and this tasted very similar so likely made in-house from from scratch.  The vegetable korma was the star; it was so smooth and delicious.  The bhartha was also delicious.  I really enjoyed all of the dishes.  Everything was very flavourful without being spicy.

I wouldn't be exaggerating to say we rolled out of there.  We took a take-out menu and hope to be back to dine in.

My only comment would be that it might elevate the experience if the tables had tablecloths, since linen napkins are already provided, and the tablecloths would be consistent with the high level of service.  It also might be nice if there were more wall hangings."}
{"text":"The owner is a very nice gentlemen, however his daughter has horrible manners and is extremely rude. First time I enjoyed my experience although the food was mediocre, but the second time the experience was frightening. The owner'a daughter was using a high pitched, aggressive and rude tone of voice. 

The beef curry is excellent, tandoori chicken is bland, naan/rice very average. It's a very commercial type of place and could use an upgrade to authentic Indian cuisine. 

Although the rest of the staff was friendly and nice, the experience was ruined by one persons demeanour. I would not feel comfortable going back to a place where I was humiliated."}
{"text":"So the food is kind of pricey for what it is, especially in comparison to other places a bit further south or east. However the service makes you return, as the staff here are pleasant, professional and absolutely the best part of this restaurant. They make excellent recommendations and I never regret taking their advice."}
{"text":"Just ok. Many restaurants in the GTA are better than this one. Not recommended. The service wasn't bad though."}
{"text":"well-prepared, tasty, authentic indian food.  (i brought along an authentic indian to verify.)  decor is nice and comfortable, service was good."}
{"text":"There are a lot negative reviews about the taste and authenticity of the food here & I would have to agree. Yes, it's true everything either is too sweet or not spicy enough or their curries/dahl are so underwhelming.  Despite that this place does serve a purpose.  It allows curious people who are unfamiliar with Indian cuisine, attempt the \" first plunge into the shallow end\", one could say.  The subtle level of spices used here won't overwhelm their western palate to the point that they will never ever try Indian food again.  

From the business owner's point of view, they must consider the demographic of the neighbourhood and adjust the cuisine to match.  Personally I prefer Banjara by Redpath, Lageez in Scarberia or Curry & Co. downtown.  If you have friends who grew up eating just meat/potatoes and with an inexperience palate, send them here, if they are feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of these reviews; this is the very definition of a three-star Indian restaurant. Given the location near Yonge and St. Clair, it's not surprising that this restaurant takes few risks -- it seems to be aiming to be the default Indian option in the area.

It's a nice room with white table cloths, but it's very standard Indian fare. The onion bhajia was flavourful and crispy, the garlic naan was suitably greasy and the chicken vindaloo was tasty, even if it wasn't as spicy as that dish would normally be prepared.

The service was very friendly and helpful and the restaurant has a few different beers available in bottles (the standard selection you find at most Indian restaurants).

This is a decent option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Firstly, Chef of India has a really lovely decor inside: both very Indian and very classy. 

Most of the dishes that they serve taste very good. However, the only downfall about this place is that for the price, they tend to skimp on some of the items. Therefore, even though the food tends to be very good, you can't help but feel slightly ripped off when you pay $5.99 for two relatively small samosas, or $3.50 for a cup of masala tea. Overall, it's a nice place, if you can stomach some of the prices."}
{"text":"Decent Indian food but many competitors in the area. 

Usually come here for the buffet. Made the mistake of coming at night thinking there's a buffet. I guess it slipped my mind that buffet was only for lunch. The food was okay, I ordered the chicken biryani. It was better than some I've had at other restaurants. There was really nothing bad I can say about the food except that the portions seemed kind of small for the price. The owner or manager was trying to chat me up at the beginning but seemed kind of fake. I don't like fake people who only cares about how much food you would order. Overall I would only come back for the buffet."}
{"text":"I was here for a lunch buffet. It was 13 bucks which with tax and tip makes it a pricey lunch. But I wanted to try it. The best thing was tandoory chicken but unfortunately they didn't have plenty of it. I got a few pieces and when I wanted more there was no more for at least 20 minutes they wouldn't refill the tray, and finally when they did it, it was only around 10 pieces of it there and this is for a lunch time buffet?! I tried also a little bit of butter chicken which was good. The rest of things I tried were not good at all they included palak paneer, rogan josh, daal. Their naan was good. Salad bar was limited but I didn't expect much as Indian cuisine in general doesn't have many salads. Desserts were not good expect for ice-cream, but how can you spoil something you are not making lol. Overall idea I would't go back there for lunch as it is not a good quality-price ratio. Service was good though."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably one of the more fancy Indian restaurants I've been too. Portions here are a bit bigger than most Indian restaurants which is awesome. I had the salad on the side, pickles, pakora, dal makhani, and gobi parantha. I definitely recommend the dal makhani. It's very creamy, flavourful and filling. The gobi parantha is nice to try too. It's a bit crispier than naan, but it was a nice change. The pickles are very salty and spicy, so a little goes a long way. It's a nice seasoning to add with the meal."}
{"text":"My experience at Chef of India was mediocre at best. The service was good, but the quality of the food left much to be desired.

The complimentary popadoms we were given at the beginning of the evening were somewhat stale and a bit chewy; not crisp as they should be.

My girlfriend ordered their Saag Paneer. What she got was a bright, radioactive green with an extremely bland taste.

I ordered a lamb vinadloo, which while being sufficiently spicy, the meat was dry and over cooked. Probably reheated.

I ordered gulab jamans for desert, and they were cold in the center, and the outside was thick, while the inside was quite mushy. I couldn't finish these.

The masala chai they served was also tasteless and very milky.

The only highlight of the evening was the paneer pakoras, we ordered as an appetizer.

Unfortunately, this was a disappointment, and for those looking for good indian cuisine, you can do a lot better in Toronto than this place."}
{"text":"Had the chicken madras with naan. I ordered online. The order was ready to pick up when I went there 15 minutes later. I'm very pick about Indian food and this tasted pretty good. The naan was fresh and cooked properly. The chicken was moist and very good. My only complaint is that the meal doesn't come with rice which they charge extra for. The naan wasn't enough to finish the main dish.

Update: tried the malai chicken which was very good also. So far everything tastes good. It doesn't necessarily taste how you would expect but it still tastes good. 

People shouldn't confuse bad taste with unexpected taste. A serious problem with Indians rating Indian food is that India is a vast country and there are many variations in spices and how dishes with the same name are cooked so everyone has their own idea of what the food should taste like. I believe this is one reason for the widely divergent ratings of some Indian restaurants resulting in the \"love it\" and \"hate it\" reviews. Although several of the things I ordered here tasted different from my expectations, overall I think the chef knows what he's doing and the meals have a good flavor."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Friday night. Service was exceptional. Our water glasses were never empty, new cutlery after each course, server made great recommendations and was very friendly.  The food was the best Indian food that I've had in Yonge eglinton area. The naan was so fresh. Great vegetarian options. Left full and satisfied for a good price. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"After realizing that Banjara didn't have a buffet anymore (and outrageously priced a la carte), we went to Chef of India as we were both craving Indian Food.

I believe the price is $11.99.  They had a very good selection between curry meats, salads and desserts.  I especially liked their tandoori chicken.  It was great.  

Verdict: My new go-to Indian buffet in the Yonge/Eg area."}
{"text":"Always go there since it is very close to my office.

FOR buffet  The lamb is the main food i get, too much milk in the source, is not that bad but not worth it for the price.
 
IN Order dinner menu, Tast better and smell good... you will smell like it when you eat too much lol still bit costly for what you get. 

will go there if project is paying me to do so ^^"}
{"text":"I thought I'd continue with the Indian kick and do lunch here today. I wasn't terribly impressed. There was a fair number of choices but they were all painfully bland. The only two dishes that approached acceptable were the dahl and the pakora khadi. The saag paneer tasted only of spinach, no spice and had very little paneer. The butter chicken was bland and had chicken full of connective tissue. The korma was generic and had no sweet, fruity, or coconut note that I hoped might be there. There was little vegetable matter in the pakora. Everything was spice-less. Like not just toned down for the locals but like boooooring. 

The redeeming quality was dessert. The gulab jamun were some of the best I've ever had. The kheer was also beautifully rich. If I get dragged back here by friends I will pass on the savory dishes and eats bowls full of dessert.

When I was ready to leave the server passed me to some other random guy and said he'd assist me with paying. He had nothing to do with me so it seemed a little strange. Anyway, he gave me the bill for an entirely different table. Then I corrected him and he didn't seem to believe me. After a couple minutes he charged me for my table. That was annoying. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for the lunch buffet, and have never been disappointed. Servers are always polite, and constantly filling up empty water glasses. The buffet has a fairly large selection, compared to the other ones I've been to, and everything I tried was very tasty. The butter chicken is my favourite. I would like to try this place for dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon and was very excited to have their vegetarian equivalent of butter chicken. I ordered it with naan and enjoyed a mango lassi on the side. I thought the food was well done and not overly greasy. It was served in a timely manner and the restaurant staff were very friendly.

It was a very quiet restaurant -- we went on a weekday evening and we were one of three tables. I'd recommend it especially if you can get the Groupon because you will get incredible value for your dollar. Without the Groupon, I would probably order a little more conservatively -- I would say that two people could split one main dish and an appetizer, along with naan, instead of having two main dishes.

Overall great food and relaxed, quiet atmosphere! Great for conversation because there's no need to yell, and a nice change from the usual bustle of Toronto's dining establishments."}
{"text":"It was tasty when I was there with my co workers but I got sick after and did not enjoy that. 

Food: 1/5, since I got sick, not much I can do about the rating here.  The butter chicken and pakoras were tasty though.

Service: 2.5/5, attentive but seemed odd about the waiters being monotone.

Ambience: 2.5/5, nice seating and large spaces.

Price: 2.5/5, $17 for lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Heard great things about this Indian restaurant, so I decided to give it a shot. I requested spicy curry and it was so bland/mild and almost sweet.  The vegetables in the curry looked like they were from a package of frozen veggies. Definitely a waste of money, unfortunately I won't be ordering from here again"}
{"text":"I'm not an experienced Indian gourmand but I came here for the \"best\" Indian food buffet according to several reviews.

My experience....adequate sums it up. Limited options for the buffet. A few salad options to begin with. Rice, naan, then your standard masala, beef curry, butter chicken, lamb, tandoori chicken. The butter chicken was best but the food overall was far from authentic.

Not too spicy which can be good or bad. Hot and replenished quickly. Overall, if I have a craving I may be back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I should have checked this place's reviews beforehand, because everything was a bit less than mild. Like there was flavour (mainly because of the sauce), not spicy at all, but nonetheless... my experience was alright. The waiters were quick to refill water and came around serving hot naan to their guests. The beef was soft and tender. The veggie dishes were filling. The coleslaw tastes sweet like Jamaican slaw. I wish they had some lamb dishes though, because those are my favourite. The butter chicken and the tandoori chicken were a bit dry. So yes, overdose on the sauce. If you're there to eat a lot and get full, you've come to the right place. It's like Mandarin, for Indian food and with less options."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on the one and only dish that I have tried at this restaurant.  The samosa's.  

I had the good fortune to try them because I was visiting our corporate head office for an audit and this place is located almost right beside it.  I typically do not eat lunch during the day, but the auditor was in the office for a few days and I ordered food for him every day.  On the very last day he was there, he said he felt for Indian food, so I looked up their take-out menu since it was right next door.  I had decided to order a samosa for myself, since I have yet to find the tastiest samosa.  I wish he had asked for Indian on the first day, because I would have gone back every day I was at the office.

To my surprise, when I returned to the office after picking up our order, the \"samosa\" I had ordered actually came with 2 on a bed of chick peas in some type of sauce, and had what looked and tasted like a dollop of sour cream or yogurt on top.  Way more food than I really wanted since I never eat during the day.

I figured I would eat one, and take the second one (along with the chick peas) home for another meal.  OMG.  I ate the first one and there was no way I could stop...I finished the whole dish of food.  I cannot wait to go back to try their luncheon buffet.  I think I have finally found the tastiest samosa."}
{"text":"I really dont know why some of the reviews on this place aren't great. My hubby and I discovered this place years ago walking along eglingtion and we have been going back ever since! The food is amazing! The way they serve their veggie samosas is the best ive ever had. They are big samosas with alot of filling and they top it with chana masala (chic pea) which I think is such a nice touch. We usually get chicken vindaloo which actually has a good amount of spice to it where as other places really lack heat in this dish. The baingan bharta (eggplant) is so delish and creamy, the flovors are so good with naan. One of the most important things to note is their place is so clean. It doesnt have the most modern look or anything but staff pays alot of attention to cleanliness. I have never had a dirty fork or knife. The glasses never ever have a water spot on them and they bring u hot freshly wiped plates to eat on before your mains. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat buffet has almost anything. The ice cream weren't so, in general I wouldn't recommend desserts. The waiters are very friendly too. I would go again as the price is very good for a buffet"}
{"text":"Indian food I always find best appreciated in the buffet format. A la carte Indian food always seems rather pricey and portions are small. And of course I'm a forkin' pig. Many Indian restaurants offer a buffet setting but always at inconvenient times: Monday to Friday during the lunch hour. Unless you're working in a nearby office,  you're basically screwed. 

Weekend buffets are much rarer but Chef of India (the Eglinton branch) offers a weekend lunch buffet. I can do that. A very convenient convenience should you be taking in a matinee showing at the nearby Y&E theater 

Buffets are always a balance between quality and quantity. Chef of India offers a smaller buffet (small as compared to, say, Mandarin) with your standards and it doesn't skimp on quality. The daal, curry chicken, basmati rice, et al were present and delivered solid taste.

I tend to judge a good Indian buffet by the quality of its tandoori chicken, naan, and pakoras. The naan was right up there. This was no Loblaws quality nann. The tandoori chicken was adequate although it was hard to find some juicer pieces. Pakoras I'm a bit spoiled in that there was a little Indian buffet near an old work place in Bellevue, Washington that -- and I'm not kidding or exaggerating here -- nailed the KFC recipe for its pakoras batter. The pakoras at Chef of India fell far short of that miracle but were good none the less.

My final test for a good Indian buffet is if they have gulab jamun on the dessert end. Gulab jamun are those sweet little balls of friend milk dough in a super sweet syrup. Heaven. Really. Most a la carte Indian restaurants will charge you $5 for one. So to find a big vat of the stuff and you can ladle at will, well, whatever an Indian buffet place charges it makes it worth it. I'm happy to report Chef of Indian has those puppies.

And the price? About $15 (including tax). What would a lunch at Mandarin set you back? 

Anyway, good stuff, no skimping on quality, and they serve up all the favorites."}
{"text":"I was here today for the lunch buffet and it was nice.

lots of good indian food; naan, palak paneer, butter chicken, different kids of rice ect. Pretty good selection for most people. Unless you eat 5x your weight in food there should be more than  enough variety for you. It tastes good and not like it was just microwaved or something

place is nice, fairly well organized for such a small space but it does seem to fill up quickly. Probably a good idea to make a reservation if you plan on coming here.

all in all a good Indian buffet."}
{"text":"I went to Chef of India with a bunch of co-workers for lunch. Seeing as it was buffet style and I only had an hour to eat it, I was rather disappointed. Those who know me, know that I like to eat for hours. Well on to the review...

I felt as though it was the same as any other indian restaurant and there was nothing too special about it. The food was good but I felt as though they had a very small selection. Although buffet style has you getting food for yourself, the service was great. I always had my glass of water filled and my plates were removed at a timely matter when I went for my second, third, and fourth serving. Like any other indian restaurant I start off with the Butter Chicken. I found it good, nothing too special. They also had food like Tandoori Chicken, Vegetable Pakoras, Eggplant, Lamb, etc. (The usual). The dessert was good aswell, they had icecream, and other Indian desserts. I would go back, but I wouldnt want to go back during work hours because once you finish eating you get that \"Itis\" and you wanna go to bed!!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place, but I ordered online yesterday and was very disappointed.

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (which is what I always order from any Indian place) and it had just a really bad flavour to it. I am not sure if it was burnt charcoal or some other burned spice but it overwhelmed everything and was very unpleasant. I believe the flavour was in the tandoor chicken itself. The chicken was tender and the portion was huge, but I just couldn't enjoy it.  The naan bread was also burnt and the veggie pakoras were too doughy.  

There are many other places nearby that are better...My vote is Banjara for veggie pakoras and definitely Jaipur Grill for Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter chicken - and for vegetarians the Sabzi Malai Methi is great there, too).

Next time, I'll go with the higher prices and go for Jaipur Grill."}
{"text":"Honestly, given the level of vitriol in some of the reviews here, I was expecting the worst from Chef of India. But it's really not that bad. (I've had much, much better Indian food, but I've also had far worse.)

We ordered two dishes: Vegetable Korma and Chicken Vindaloo.

The Chicken Vindaloo (\"Chicken cooked with red hot chillies with potatoes in hot and sour gravy\") is clearly the superior of the two. The sauce is rich and spicy, while the fairly plentiful chicken was devoid of bad, inedible pieces. (It might've been a little dried out, admittedly.) The presence of a bay leaf notwithstanding, I really enjoyed eating this dish.

Not so much with the Vegetable Korma (\"Mixed vegetables cooked with cashew nuts, onion, cream and spices\"), unfortunately. First and most egregious, the vegetables had clearly emerged directly from a bag out of the freezer, as they were uniformly soggy and tasteless. (The telltale jagged cut on the pieces of carrot gave it away immediately.) Other than that, the sauce was hopelessly bland and devoid of spice, so there was really nothing within this dish that worked.

I mean, would I ever order from Chef of India again? Probably not, given the wealth of other, better options in the area. But you could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"The food was very average and the first round of the buffet was cold.  I had eaten here a couple of times before and the for was much better."}
{"text":"This is a review of the dinner menu, as opposed to the buffet.   We stopped here on a pit of a lark - wanted to get out of the house and picked the neighbourhood, then an eating place close to where we wanted to park.

Decor is a bit seedy and some of the decoration look like they may have been left over from a previous restaurant of a different ethnicity (Spanish?) .  Don't let this put you off.  Food and service were great.  Helpful and considerate waiter - he even helped my put my coat on.  A split appetizer order of tandoori chicken was tender and nicely presented.  Main dishes of madras chicken and lamb vindaloo were also excellent and the lamb was buttery tender.    Pistachio kulfi was a nice ending and generously flavoured with cardamom - we'll return to sample the buffet."}
{"text":"Mother's day buffet. They hiked up the price to $17.99. They actually scotch taped a sheet of paper over the sign outside to cover up the everyday price of $15.99.

The buffet itself was sparse, and most of the meat dishes were empty and they did not replenish them while we were  there.  The place wasn't busy enough to explain the lack of food. It was perplexing. We ended up having to fill up on salad and cole slaw. Not worth $17.99

Also, the naan bread was visibly greasy. Very unappetizing.

Total disappointment."}
{"text":"We tried the Chef of India last night for the first time and were delighted by our choice. By far the best Indian food in the Yonge/Lawrence neighbourhood, and we found the Dinner for 2 to be excellent value at $45. We chose two mains, butter chicken and sag paneer, and they were accompanied with the best samosas we have ever had. Rice, naan and papadum w/chutney sauce accompanied the meal. The flavours were subtle, fragrant and spiced just right. Truly delicious. Excellent customer service and a nice casual atmosphere too. We discovered they have free delivery so will try that next time."}
{"text":"Jaipur Grille is my favorite Indian restaurant in the neighborhood, but they have no buffet, making Chef of India the best choice if you're looking to stuff yourself.  It is a lunch buffet only - 7 days a week, for $10.99. 

The buffet consists of a cold food section, a hot food section, and dessert.  The cold food section has carrots, chickpeas, coleslaw, a mixed veggie salad, etc.  It's a good chance to get some fresh veggies in you before all the meat and sauces!   The hot food section has tandori chicken, curry goat, curry beef, butter chicken, rice, naan, mushroom curry, vegetable pakura, a cauliflower dish, and a spinach dish who's name I also can't recall.  There is also yogurt and a a sizable variety of chutneys and other sauces.

Desserts are rice pudding and Gulab Jamun - basically deep fried balls of dough in a sweet syrup - if you haven't tried it, it's better than it sounds!

In my experience it's never really busy there, but enough that the food is fresh.  It's actually a very peaceful place to sit and have a leisurely lunch on a Sunday afternoon.   The food is not amazing and some times the meats don't seem to be of the highest quality - but in my opinion, it is exactly what you should expect from a buffet."}
{"text":"Not the best but also not the worst. However, if you can make it to a better Indian restaurant, go there and not here! The only reason I would go here instead of other Indian restaurants would be its nearness to my place...and the price for the dinner buffet is pretty good as well. The service was quite good as well; they were friend and attentive."}
{"text":"Haven't try their food yet but at least as soon as I walk into the restaurant, I was greeted by one of the staffs. 

He was very friendly and he made me sit down and gave me a glass of water even tho I was only there for a take-out. 

Even tho I'm still waiting to try their food but at least their service makes me want to come back here again"}
{"text":"I came here few months ago and the food was amazing... except.. NOT SPICY! At all!! It was a bit disappointing because I love Indian food, and real Indian food has to be spicy. When I asked the manager about it, he gave me strange answer: \"Why do you need spicy!? White girl like you don't eat spicy!\" I was like - really? Why not??!
So yeah, that was a bit weird. He offered to bring me chili or something but you know.. that's not the same.. Indian food is cooked with spices...
Anyhow, the food was tasty, except few dishes like Spinach Paneer that was completely tasteless.
Other than that, the restaurant is located just across from Eglinton subway station, has many tables, great selection of dishes - hot and cold. Also, they had couple of dessert options, one of them was cold Gulab Jamun. This was my first time ever I ate cold (fridge cold) Gulab Jamun!! Either they forgot to heat it up (which means it was not fresh) or... it's just the way they serve it here. I did not enjoy it cold.
I would definitely like to return here, however the lack of spices is something that keeps me away."}
{"text":"We had the buffet lunch there today.  I love Indian food ... this was so-so.

There were 16 choices, which included rice, buttered chicken, curried beef, naan, curried goat, veggies, etc. plus salad items and dessert.

The buttered chicken wasn't bad ... the naan was cold and kind of crunchy.

The service was great ... they were always refilling our glasses and taking our plates away.

I doubt I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I order online here on the dailyyyy if you have ubereats then you should definitely check this place out for some bless indian food. 

Honestly way better than Amaya or any of the go to quick indian places. 

I get the Mattar Paneer + Naan and truuuust me you need their naan. Amazing consistency and not too stringy but has the right amount of volume to it. 

I honesty really like how it doesn't automatically come with rice because it's a pretty big portion as is and with the bread it gets me super full! 

My brother got the butter chicken and says its a must have as well. 

Would definitely recommend anyone trying to get reasonably priced indian food. 

My go to place uptown!"}
{"text":"Meh - i don't get it.

My colleagues love coming here. I don't. 

The truth is:
-Food could potentially be left overs in the buffet (doesn't taste fresh)
- Meat options are limited 
- Appetizers are limited
- Service is a little too much but this may not be something to complain about  
- Dessert choices is only between two things.

Why do people love this lunch buffet? It's cheap, but if i'm doing a dirty buffet, i'd do the mandarin over this. And i really don't want to go to the mandarin either."}
{"text":"I went there for an event. The downsides:
1) Extremely rude waitress. She asked us to move tables without cross-checking that we were actually a part of the event. Later, she actually yelled at our group to move as we lined up to pay the bill.

2) Food was luke-warm/cold. The palak paneer was really bad and had a funny taste to it. When we mentioned it to the staff, we were told that nobody had else had complained about it!

The upside:
1) Had a variety of dishes. That's about it!

Go there if you have no other option to eat. There are lots of other Indian places in Toronto that have much better food and service."}
{"text":"There are pros and cons about this place.

Pros:

1. The waiter was really kind and we were welcomed with a smile.

2. We were seated were ever we wanted.

Cons:

1. For one entree it's $15 with no rice, I mean every Indian place serves rice with the entrees. I was bummed to find out when we had to pay $3 more for rice! So total for one person it's $18, that's just ridiculous and overpriced.

2. In addition to, we had to share our food because the portion was too small for two people. I'm honestly shocked and upset that it was all overpriced and our total came out to be $62!!!! For two tiny plates of barely any chicken, a little plate of rice, four slices of naan brand, and overpriced beer.

3. I'm also honestly shocked that my chicken tikka massala didn't have a thick sauce, and that both tiny plates of barely any chicken had a chewy and not well done meat. This made me upset because I felt that the food was rushed.

4. Wait time. The wait time took a long time that we both had to start eating chips that we bought from a store previously. 

5. At the end of our meal I told our waiter about the portion size and that you had to pay an additional $3 for rice and $4 for technically 2 peices of naan bread (they were cut in half.) and he said it's management who does the prices like that. I was SHOCKED...

6. The waiter took a long time to bring out my chai tea and he brought it out with our food. (Those of you who eat Indian food, you will know that tea comes before the meal and not during because then you will be full)

7. The waiter gave us HUMONGOUS plates when really the food portion was small, I think they did that to make people think that it's a lot of food.

In general I'm sorry to say this but we will not be back ever again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but the food was so-so. Next time, I'd rather go to Trimurti on Queen. It's smaller, but the food at Trimurti tastes better in my opinion."}
{"text":"A nice spot for Indian food! Opened at noon on a Saturday. Went in and it was a bit warm but after sitting for a bit, I think they turned the ac on. The food selection was really good! Lots of salad options and veggie and meat curries. Service was great. The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full. Also it is $12.99 per person, not bad at all. Good selection of desserts too :)"}
{"text":"We only ever got take out here, so I cannot comment on the atmosphere.  At Chef of India, they have pretty good Indian food, but it's sort of typical, with heavy sauces.  The butter chicken is a little on the sweet side for me.  The Tandoori dishes are good with smoky flavor."}
{"text":"I sincerely dislike the food at this place. The food is sweet and completely not authentic. Better places to go to around here are Jaipur Grille (great food and lunch value) or Banjara (better food than Chef of India but decor is drab).

My colleagues have also had some terrible experiences with the lunch buffet here."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal. I have eaten here literally 100 times. We have large retirement or birthday parties here and have eaten alone or in small groups. The food is very tasty and incredible value for price. It is clean and well decorated. The staff is friendly and attentive. They have a good range of food for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Nothing bad to say. I'm hungry now."}
{"text":"Want the verdict? Cookie cutter Indian.  

I recently ordered from Chef of India. Didn't feel like cooking. Really felt like some naan. What am I saying, I never need much of an excuse to order Indian food. 

I had the tandoori chicken appetizer, the butter chicken and two pieces of garlic naan. 

I found the tandoori chicken to be really tasty and a huge portion (half a chicken) so that was a pleasant surprise. Lovely.

The butter chicken was not my favourite (not enough of that yoghurt taste, more red than I prefer) and the seasoning wasn't really balanced  (all I could taste and smell was saffron).

The naan was alright, a big piece so wish I'd just ordered one. Not very buttery but they are generous with the garlic coating.

Overall it was an a-okay dining experience and I was able to eat my order in two separate settings. But their prices are outrageous and they are a bit misleading about portion sizes (I was encouraged to get two naans when that was absolutely unnecessary). 

Frankly, for Indian it was pretty bland. An emergency measure really.

I RECOMMEND: Shopping around for better priced/made options. 
(If this place was more budget friendly, I'd probably give it a another try but there are too many Indian joints at a better value in the area. La lutta aka the search continua. This is a good problem to have lol)

EXTRA TIP: Pretty huge menu so while I stick to my faves, you might find more to your liking."}
{"text":"I went here for a farewell lunch with coworkers & we all had the buffet.  I was glad to see that they had plenty of vegetarian options.  Their eggplant dish was -definitely- the standout among them.

The rest wasn't as 'spiced' & flavorful as I prefer but perhaps with the buffet they are trying to reach the lowest common denominator as not to offend a single taste bud.

I wouldn't travel out of my way to eat here, but it was convenient for my work neighborhood."}
{"text":"Update: Sad to see them go. Really miss those salty lassis!

The staff here are sooooo sweet and friendly!! I have eaten at pretty much every India restaurant I can find in Toronto for the last 10 years and I LOVE these guys! TASTY TASTY TASTY TASTY!!!! I've eaten pretty  much everything in their vegetarian section and it's all divine!  Having just returned from 5 weeks in India, I can say their seasoning is fantastic! Where I've found many places have an inch of oil sitting on their daals and gobis - these guys have never been greasy like that. All delicious! Eat the cheese pakoras!!"}
{"text":"Reliable lunch buffet. Best items are tandoori chicken, goat curry, butter chicken, and a surprisingly good salad bar, esp. the crunchy lentil salad. Disappointing were the beef curry (all bone, no meat), veggie pakoras (all batter, no veg), and naan (dry and tasteless). Food is all mild, even on the sweet side - would be nice to have 1 or 2 very spicy dishes like vindaloo. Price is very reasonable and is the same even on weekends. I miss the Banjara lunch buffet, but this is a close substitute. Note: The restaurant is on the 2nd floor, accessible only by stairs."}
{"text":"I love this place... They have a really awesome lunch buffet for $13.99. The selection is great and super fresh!"}
