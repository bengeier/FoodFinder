{"text":"This place is just like being in mainland Spain ,it's small and relaxed , the staff are very friendly and helpful . We opted for the Serrano ham and cheese toasted sandwich and cafe con leche and it was great plus free wifi. The whole front of the cafe opens up soon a hot sunny day you can sit and watch the world go by!"}
{"text":"Situated right next to Carmen, Mercat is an all encompassing cafe and pantry. Popular items include Spanish omelettes (Tortilla Espa√±ola), sandwiches, salads, and various desserts on rotation.  All non-Spanish food is within100km radius ensuring all sourced from the province. Some of the items for sale are oils, eggs, house made preserves, soups, meats, and seasonal vegetables/fruits.   Coffee was fantastic with my Americano topped with a nice smooth crema.  Service stood out most with friendly staff. The conversation alone will keep you coming back.  PS. Tile game strong!"}
{"text":"disappointed by my recent visit.  I walked in and there was just me and another girl seated.  I stood by the counter. He saw me. Looked at his phone and kept doing whatever with it. I was taken aback.   I would have left except I made a trip here just to have a slice of Spanish totrtilla. I stood there and waited for him to stop whatever he was doing to help me.             I've never come across anyone who saw a customer standing there and make them wait without any acknowledgement.  I sat down and he told me he'd bring over my order. It's the first time someone actually didn't bring or offer any milk or sugar.  I walked up to the counter and put some into a napkin. He didn't notice me at all.  he had disappeared in the back somewhere.  He never came back to me.   a little surprised to see two large dogs let inside a food establishment. they were cute but I thought not too good for health and safety.   very disappointed.  It has been such a positive experience in the past.    I'm all about an all round experience.  No matter how good a place is if the people that carry the store aren't representing it's hard to want to come back."}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, even when the main restaurant is closed this cafe/sandwich shop is open for a quick bite or a leisurely coffee. The space is lovely, with intricate tiles and pantry items decorating the open space. On good days, the front is open to the street so it makes for a perfect place to take in the neighbourhood and enjoy the warmer weather. The service is friendly and cheerful, our server was willing to make recommendations and explain anything in the glass case that caught my eye.  Food choices include large sandwiches ($8) and multiple tarts. The tortilla espanola was recommended as a favourite. It comes by itself or in a sandwich form, and I liked the light texture with plenty of fresh flavor. The serrano sandwich is it's polar opposite. It is heavier, dense and slightly dry, but is packed with that distinct intense ham flavor that makes it delicious anyways. In all, a great place to spend a lazy afternoon."}
{"text":"Well, isn't this little Spanish market by Carmen adorable!   I was pushing a little lug around Queen W and she fell asleep in her ride, and my stomach start grumbling and the open door to Mercat del Carmen was oh-so inviting. In we rolled.  I had a spanish omelette sandwich, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Warm and fresh. They appear to have a wonderful coffee and tea selection, too, along with lots of high end european groceries."}
{"text":"Mercat del Carmen is located next the Spanish restaurant Carmen. This cozy and welcoming cafe/marketplace/pantry is filled with delicious goodies that makes you feel like you've gone to Spain.  I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon around 12pm for some coffee. The interior makes you feel at home with it's pretty floor tiles and the big wall mural. When I went, the weather was just nice enough so the employees had opened up the front of the cafe, perfect for people watching. I ordered an Americano and was told that they would bring me my drink. Perfect relaxing atmosphere while watching the world go by. By the time I paid for my drink at the end, the place was already buzzing with other customers. Staff are super friendly and this place definitely takes me back to Spain. Friendly, warm, relaxing vibes."}
