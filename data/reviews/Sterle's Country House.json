{"text":"I decided to check this place out after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives (look on YouTube).  I am not particularly ethnic and have been lukewarm on Chicken Paprikash as I have found it to be bland.  I got the paprikash because Guy did (why not?) and it was by far the most flavorful paprikash that I have ever had.  The lunch portion came with a copious amount of bread and butter, as well as a choice of soup or salad.  A recent trip to Das Schnitzel Haus reminded me that Eastern European restaurants don't exactly specialize in salads, so I got the chicken noodle soup.  I was not disappointed!  The waitress was not the friendliest lady ever, but I had everything I needed, so no complaints here.  For being in the city, the parking lot and dining spaces are huge."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Food was good. Had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. Had to wait 5 min to get the dressing that should of come out with our salad. Asked for napkins at the beginning of our meal...never got them."}
{"text":"good service, odd (traditional) but fun atmosphere, large portions.  had the pork roast, it was good, but nothing spectacular. place would be fun with a big group. they have a small bar but i would enjoy grabbing a few drinks there if it was in a different area."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for lunch. Our whole table loved the food (one is Hungarian). I had the Sterles's schnitzel which was great. Excellent service. I wish they had more of a European beer selection, and less domestics. The menu is small, but it doesn't matter if everything tastes good."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sterle's for over 30 years. Last night will be the last time I ever go there again. We walked in the door at 6:35 at 6:45 the waiter finally took our drink order (ok I can live with that because he was new there) at 7:00 he finally came to take our order and we ordered another round of drinks. He forgot to ask about what salad dressing we wanted. At 7:10 we called the hostess over (who I assume is one of the owners) and asked her to make sure our salads were ordered. Only 3 salad dressings available. The two tables on both sides of us walked in about 15 minutes after us and already had their salads and soup and received their dinners while we were still waiting for our 2nd round of drinks.   Needless to say we never received our salads or bread or second round of drinks. I have never been a complainer but at 7:40 we walked out and left. This is the first time we have ever walked out of a restaurant in the 30 years we have been married.  Now not be a fuddy duddy but we are not that old and can understand that the new owners want to change it up a little with changes to the interior and a new look but you had better concentrate on customer service first. Even on a busy night when Margo owned it the service was better. The reason I say that is because not only did the waiter take our order but so did the hostess.  Writing on the wall? A couple of things I noticed: - Wine list.....list 4 house wines only one available last night. - Salad dressing.....3 available and no French dressing. - Now open Monday's - Looked around the room...not very many older people but not very many young people either. - Customer service definitely lacking. - Accordionist instead of full band.  All cost cutting measures  I wish these new owners success but their business model is not working.   Quite frankly after 30 years I am not going back. It's a shame to lose long time customers.  And keep in mind I have never written a review on Yelp and have never walked out of a Restaurant before either.  Kevin C."}
{"text":"I am visiting our Son and family and along with my wife and older  Son we (8 of us) will be going to Sterle's at 1pm for our FIRST TIME and I am very anxious to try the Chicken Paprekaush ( can't spell ) I will let everyone know ... I'm sure everyone in the USA wants to know if it's as good as it looks when this was highlighted on Diners, drive-ins & dives we will soon find out !!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Sterle's today. Since the Hofbrau House closed  many years ago, Sterle's had been an acceptable substitute. I hadn't been since the ownership change until today.  http://www.cleveland.com/dining/index.ssf/2012/08/sterles_slovenian_country_hous.html  Ordered the usual Wienerschnitzel with salad and home fries. The schnitzel was bland with no puffy spots where the flour got excited in fact  it didn't seem hand breaded it was more granular like you might find on a boxed breaded fish filet . (I wonder if  it is a Northern Haserot product)  The home fries have the skin on are cut too small  then served in scooped portions. The taters are dry not yummy the luscious mouth feel that comes with time and butter is no more. Also I asked for oil & vinegar for my salad but  it was as if I'd said Coke in a Pepsi place, was told \"Italian dressing.\"  The uniforms have also changed from the laced vests and puffy sleeves to washed-out black t-shirts.  I imagine the previous owners wanted to retire but maybe the kitchen staff could have been persuaded to stay as long as they wanted. Maybe developers shouldn't own restaurants.   This page from the newly designed website  http://www.sterlescountryhouse.com/index.htm#history   sort of makes me angry that they write the history as if it were their history without mentioning that the restaurant was purchased and is under new owners,"}
{"text":"what a fun time!!!! tons of delish food served family style in a fun atmosphere and good beer with a polka band. PERFECTION!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to see the polka band with about 18 people, wasnt sure what to expect, but we all had a great time, food took awhile, but in the mean time our waitress brought us free salad and soup for the whole table to share, I wanted the cabbage rolls as a meal,..they are only an add on to meals on the menu,  but she was very accommodating. All in all, the food was awesome, and everyone had a great time, tables are a bit crowded, but I guess that's family style. Great place for family gatherings!! The band was really great, and had everyone up and dancing!!"}
{"text":"Chas M nailed it.   Food was ok.   Service was very slow.  The amazing thing is there are a ton of reviews that all say the same thing.  Management not paying attention."}
{"text":"Family style makes me smile & awakens all your senses. There is something about the experience that quickly connects a group of people. Passing platters & pitchers to your neighbor as their eyes light up, smiling with excitement as their senses come alive. The smell of the food,the sight of the delicious dishes, the feel of the warm platters, the sound of Polka & accordions. Take some down & pass it around. Your sure to have some fun.  Breaking away from my plant strong diet, I squeezed some lemon on my weinerschnitzel, put some pepper on my potatoes, scooped up some sauerkraut & forgave myself for what was to come. A feast for carnivores, vegetations beware. I skipped the pork roast & the sausage, there were plenty of takers at the table. A few to go boxes & nothing went to waste. We finished the meal with their apple strudel as we watched couples of all ages move around the dance floor. My husband & I sat & watched. I have yet to recover from the last time I did the polka with my Grandfather, he said I am as light on my feet as a 200# dead woman."}
{"text":"My wife and I had gotten a gift certificate for Sterle's from our friends, so we decided to take those friends there for lunch one Sunday at the end of the summer, as one of them, a BIG-TIME Yelper, had never been there.  The place was featured on Food Network's Diner, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Ohio native Guy Fieri, but I had patronized it long before there was even a Food Network on TV.  My wife had the Weinerschnitzel, which reminds me of my Slovak babicka's \"rezne,\" despite the fact that the schnitzel at Sterle's is veal and my babi's was a pork chop. My wife enjoyed it and everytime I've had it, it is very good and reminds me of growing up in Eastern Europe during the early 70's.  I had been on my meatless diet for only a few weeks, when I fell of the wagon and ordered the brolied pork chop with mushrooms, which I had with home mashed potatoes. The dish was good, but not as good as the schnitzel, for example.   For dessert we had the palacinky (crepes), which were filled with fruit jam and sprinkled with confectioners sugar. Not bad, but not great.  Rumor has it that Margo, the owner of the resturant and Frank's widow, is looking to sell the place, or maybe even shut it down if there's no good offers.   For those who haven't tried it, I would recommend you go before they shut their doors or change it into something different. No, the food is not high quality, but it is good eats, like grandma used to make, and the place just ooozes Eastern Europe and blue-collar Cleveland.  Nazdravie!"}
{"text":"Great eats, the Weinerschnitzel was pretty good. I lived in Europe for 12 years and have to say the schnitzel was not exactly as I remembered it but still A-Ok. Plenty of parking and we got seated almost immediatley. The decor is old world and rustic with the polka style band playing in the background. Had I been there with my family I would have taken them on the dance floor to have a little fun after a beer or two. I would go again to try other items on the menu. The crowd seemed mixed with older folks and families. Friendly waitress too."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be.  The food is ok but very bland.  I have to say the service was the worst.  I had to ask for a plate twice for my daughter and we were finished eating by the time it showed up.  I asked for napkins and they never came.  My family told me this was a great place and when I brought them here all they could say was \"At least it still has good music.\"  They brought out desert and they said they had no more forks.  They pulled them from our dirty dishes and told us to wipe them off.  Still waiting on the napkins to clean the forks with..."}
{"text":"If you are ever in the neighborhood, Do yourself a favor and drop in for a quick meal. The food is so so, but the atmosphere is AMAZING. Close your eyes, count to five, and open them again and you might just think you are in eastern Europe. The wait staff is authenticly dressed. The food is hearty and filling, but far from fantastic. Don't go for the food, go for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the most charming places to eat in Cle especially if you are fortunate enough to go on a Friday for polka night. It feels like you're eating in huge old Slovenian family's dining room. There's a lack of pretense here I really enjoy.  Their fried tilapia is one of the best I had in my life, super crisp and not greasy. And their pierogis are everything a pierogi should aspire to be. Plump and buttery and a little artery clogging but totally worth it. The homemade bread and butter are delcious too.   I took my parents here over a year ago and they still talk about it."}
{"text":"So much yum and nom if you are into this type of food. Awesome beers, great for family, cute place."}
{"text":"Friendly but dumb service at the bar Small portions cold expensive food."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Sterle's...comfortable and totally old-school.  My wife and I visited last night before a show, early enough to walk right in and get seated.  With so few people in the place (yet), we thought our service would be prompt and efficient...not so much.  In the end, we were rushing to get our in time for our show.  Maybe that was our fault, but arriving just before 6pm we were jogging to the car about 7:20pm to get down to Cleveland Playhouse.  Anyways...the place is charming and friendly.  Polka band cranked up just after 6pm and my wife even convinced me to take a spin around the dance floor.  Our meal started with a beer-flight sampler, which led us to ordering their house-made wheat beer from the bunch of four choices.  Seemed like a perfect pairing for the Slovenian / German food to follow.  For an appetizer we shared the Bavarian pretzel sticks...what an awesome choice!  They were served warm, soft and accompanied by a garlic butter and a spicy brown mustard (which was the clear winner).  The menu states it also comes with a beer cheese dip, but ours did not for some reason.  For our meal, we each ordered a \"family style\" platter (so as to try a bunch of main dishes).  We chose roast pork, pierogis and chicken paprikash.  The dinner began with a plated salad of iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots, tomato, cucumber and a very mild oil dressing (pretty standard issue stuff).  The main meal arrived on several plates.  The roast pork was tender and covered in a nice brown gravy.  The pierogis were decent and of course served with sour cream.  The chicken paprikash came in its own bowl and consisted mostly of dumplings, with a \"gravy\" that had a heavy pepper (like the vegetable) flavor combined with onions and spices.  Not bad.  The veggie medley seemed underwhelming, but all had a nice crispness/freshness to them.  The garlic mashed potatoes were buttery and creamy.  In a rush, we ordered to-go boxes and a cherry strudel (included in the family style meal).  They came out cut in squares and had the consistency of being recently microwaved and chewy.  A bit disappointing.  Overall, i'm so glad we gave Sterle's a try and would love to come back with a larger group and truly do a family-style meal.  Expect a decent meal in a fun atmosphere, but not much else than that."}
{"text":"Those of you commenting that Sterle's might not have the best schnitzel you have ever eaten are missing the charm and point of this place. Sterle's is part of Cleveland's cultural heritage, part of a heartbeat of the past and present of our city, a piece of history that still exists. This is the kind of place that immediately reminds you of the old bustling and proud history of our downtown and is frankly the kind of place I think Tony Bourdain would appreciate more than Fieri. The servers are fantastic and I have never heard music like at Sterle's at any other restaurant in Cleveland. This place is the true restaurant experience for me- families celebrating the most important events of life, polka vets, and for the record, the food IS fantastic.  Get adventurous with the menu.    If you consider yourself at all proud or fond of Cleveland, or are a visitor trying to get a sense of the town philosophy, it would be a travesty not to come!"}
{"text":"this was my first visit to Sterle's and after reading all the reviews, I decided to still go and see for myself...AND I AM GLAD THAT I DID!!!!    went with friends on a Sunday for lunch and it was LOVELY!  food was delicious and the portions were HUGE!  we ordered family style - and was in heaven!!!!    our waitress, Barbara, was a GEM and took care of us like we were \"family\"  okay, now granted, I nor my friends, had ever been there before with the original owners - which from the reviews I've read - must have been the bee's knees.... yet, I know that we will be back and on a Saturday night so we can also enjoy the live music."}
{"text":"Sterle's was a real treat. This place has been around since my Mom was a girl. I took her back to the old neighborhood to share her memories. We arrived about 11:50 and it was perfect timing because within 10 minutes the place was jamming. Servers was great. The food was seriously ,FABULOUS...we had the Chicken Soup, side salad, fresh bread & real butter, liver and onions Sautéed in Marsala Wine, Chicken Paprikash, Wienerschnitzel. We were STUFFED. The polka music topped it all off so very nicely. We will definitely be back during my next visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great place for some authentic Eastern European food. The atmosphere has an old world charm and the waitresses are extremely nice. Going with a relatively large group, their service was still pretty good and the food came out fairly quickly. We ordered the family style, which included everything from soup to dessert. It was my first time trying Wienerschnitzel, which was pretty good along with the potatoes and sauerkraut (my favorites).   I heard they have music and dancing on Fridays and Saturdays. Unfortunately, I was there on a Thursday, but next time it'll be on a dancing night for sure."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more- everything we had wasn't bad but I really wanted to try chicken paprikash everyone raves about but they weren't serving that this day.  The main courses were very good as were pretzels and chicken soup (but was wayyy to hot- burnt our mouths). I wasn't a fan of the beet salad .  It's a preset menu so if you don't like an option your unfortunately can't swap anything out.  I will say it was a good amount of food!"}
{"text":"Weinerschnitzel and strudel goodness. period.  The place is a bit rustic with cute touches of old world 1970's decor, heavy on the wooden paneling and picturesque murals all over the walls.  The nice waitresses remind me of the bavarian dancers during Oktoberfest.  Our waitress was very direct about food suggestions.     The food was okay, some entrees were a bit better than others with the family style dinners.  I really enjoyed the weinerschnitzel- crispy and tender with each bite.  I wish i would have just gotten weinerschnitzel dish, instead.  I felt a bit healthier eating the dish when I squeezed the lemon on top haha (suppose to cut a bit of the grease).    The sausage was good, not great- similar to any brat you can get from a ballpark or perhaps the grocery store.  The potatoes were hearty, nothing to special, but nostalgic to getting breakfast from the corner diner on Sunday mornings with my dad.    I palette didn't really jump with the salad, the \"chicken\" noodle soup, saurkraut, or vegetables.  The salad is a plain out of the bag salad with Italian dressing on top (even though is a Solvenian restaurant?).  The \"chicken\" noodle soup is really just noodles with chicken stock or boullion cubes- similar to out of the packet soup mix.   The saurkraut is like other kraut that I have tasted on my corned beef sandwiches- added a nice sour/vinegar touch to the meal that was needed to lighten the heavy meal.  The vegetables were most likely canned or frozen and heated.  The homemade apple strudel was soo soo GOOD.  It was probably one, if not the best apple strudel I have had.  I love the little raisins with the apple-pie like filing.  It was wasn't overly sweet (I got mine without powdered sugar) and just perfect to end the meal.    I was a bit disappointed with their beer selection as they only had a few light beers and not a single dark in stock.  I believe they only had one or two dark beers on the menu, as well.    I would definitely go back for some schnitzel and strudel, but not much else."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in the Cleveland area and had opportunity to visit this landmark restaurant. I was quite surprised on walking in. I didn't realize it would be so rustic and plain. The portions were large. I ordered the schnitzel which came with just an average salad and mashed potatoes and schnitzel. My husband and I each ordered a beer which we thought would be different but it was very run of the mill. $45.00 U.S. later which equated to $72.00 Canadian not worth returning for. I was hoping to die for schnitzel and it wasn't. It was good though."}
{"text":"Went to Sterle's after seeing it on triple-D and on the first leg of a road trip from A2 to Boston. Was hoping it wasn't one of these terrible places that Guy somehow manages to make look amazing, and indeed it wasn't! I had the wienerschnitzel and my lovely co-star had the goulash, but we ended up trading dishes half way through and each of us liked the other dish better. The beef in the goulash was incredibly tasty and tender. The schnitzel was a little bland for my taste but she liked it a lot and is 100% German so I'd go with her opinion over mine.  Overall I'd have to say that this place is just A-OK; was expecting either spectacular homecooked food or a complete bust, but it landed somewhere in the middle. The chicken soup was alright but I'm not sure I \"get\" the ravings. The potato soup our friend ordered was a little odd; it was a tomato-based soup (unexpected!) that tasted a bit like Chef Boyardee spaghetti-Os to be honest. The salad had a lot of vinegar-y dressing on it. Go with the chicken soup.  Overall, definitely give this place a shot if you're in the area, especially if you're a fan of European dining, but it wasn't my favorite-favorite."}
{"text":"I'm close to a 4 for the entire experience. The atmosphere is amazing!   The food is definitely a 3 except for the weinerschnitzel, a 4.5.   Sterle's is great for big groups / large parties. They have many long tables flanking a dance floor and stage, where polka bands play on the weekends. We had about 20 people in our party and they easily fit along the sides. When everyone arrived, they were all amazed at the atmosphere. You really do feel like you're in a different world.   Like the others say, definitely go with the weinerschnitzel. Fried and breaded veal cutlets for the win. Their portions are plentiful so you will definitely have leftovers. Alternatively, you could share with someone. We also enjoyed the pretzel with beer cheese dip. Mm! I had the pierogies - it was pretty filling as well and I took some home with me. They weren't as good as other places' pierogies though. However, it's a good alternative to the weinerschnitzel.   The dishes were pretty pricy ($18 for weinerschnitzel, $15 for pierogies), so the next time we go we are going to do the family feast. It's definitely worth the price.   This is also the location of the Cleveland Flea!"}
{"text":"Two years ago the Sunday Bloody Mary bar was excellent & reasonable. Now half the condiments for the Bloody Mays are gone and prices soaring.  Over priced drinks with an ever changing prices on the BBQ food. The BBQ rib was like jerky and pulled pork was dry & fatty.  They had no business the day I stopped,so must be the last person to know how much they went down hill.  Man m bummed my favorite stop ended up like this."}
{"text":"Had a big family celebration tonight with 24 people.  Soup was not the best with lots of broth and a few noodles but the rest of the meal was plentiful, served hot and yummy.  We chose family style servings of weinerschnitzel, sausage, potatoes, roast pork and green beans.  Food was good, service could improve, as our table didnt get cleared right away  between courses .  Great ambience for families.  Polka music was good and not terribly loud.  Had fun, would come back."}
{"text":"Huge portions, authentic dishes and hard working friendly staff.  Definitely worth the trip.  Try the pork schnitzel, and sausage and sauerkraut."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. Sterle's is a Cleveland institution. The food is delicious, the murals are beautiful and the owners are exceptionally community minded. Check it out!  Also go to a polka night!"}
{"text":"Our first experience at Sterle's was a bit of an odd one. We stopped in around 6pm on a Thursday. We entered through the main entrance walked down the long hallway and arrived at the hostess station. Nobody. We looked around. Not a soul. We could hear the sounds of conversation and sports on TV but still saw no one. Apparently, we were the only ones here outside of the staff that was engrossed in the World Cup action on the bar televisions. My wife actually had to walk inside the main dining area and flag someone down.  First of all, this place is huge. Imagine a massive open dining area with seating for something like 150 people and a stage/dancefloor area. Now imagine it completely empty. We were the only people there. Don't get me wrong, I loved having the place all to ourselves, it was just strange. No music, just the sounds of soccer in the background. The bar, seating for about 10, is off the the side. Lest I forget, there's also a huge biergarten out back with lots of canopied picnic tables and its own bar. Turns out, that's where a party of about 10 that we didn't see when we arrived had taken up residence. Wasn't so vacant after all. Moving on.  The atmosphere is something out of the old Bavarian restaurant playbook - murals depicting tree-lined landscape scenes with quaint castles and mountain scenes, backlit stained glass windows depicting flowers and dancing girls. It was both creepy and kitschy. The razor's edge between nightmare and dreamscape. I kinda liked it.  The beer list is skewed toward the traditional German-styles with a selection of five house beers all brewed off-premise by Sprecher Brewery in Wisconsin. There's a beer for just about every taste but I'd recommend the Black Lager and the Munken Weizen wheat beer to truly take your Slovenian dining experience to the next level. After all, what's a meal at Sterle's without the beer?  Our server was very friendly and accommodating, doting on us throughout our time there. I guess getting attentive service when you're the only diners in a restaurant shouldn't be all that impressive, but it was still nice. Waters were always full, she checked in often, and the kitchen paced our meal nicely.  Speaking of the meal, don't come here expecting to eat low-carb. Holy shit, the carbs. I probably had enough in me to run the Cleveland marathon twice after leaving. It's all old-world comfort foods here. Sausage, pierogi, chicken paprikash, spaetzel, wienerschnitzel, roasted pork and sauerkraut. I make it no secret that my German heritage makes me a sucker for this kind of grub. I was definitely ready to loosen the belt a few notches on this night.  Sticking with my goal of trying every soft pretzel in NE Ohio, we started with the Bavarian pretzels with beer cheese sauce. While the pretzels were your traditional stick variety they were soft, warm and well-salted. The real star was the beer cheese sauce that came with them. I could have eaten a bowl of the stuff all by itself. Delicious.  Our dinner was monstrous, easily enough to feed a family of four. We each got a side salad, small bowl of chicken paprikash, a plate with roasted pork, green beans, two pierogi and scalloped potatoes. We also got a bowl of sour cream and a bowl of apple sauce on the side for the pierogi.   Overall, the food was delicious, filling and definitely a taste of a generation gone by. The side salad was your typical out-of-a-bag lettuce mix with some sliced cukes and tomatoes on top. The Green beans were cooked a perfect al dente. The pierogi were a bit on the gummy side but the slight sweetness from the caramelized onions were a nice counter. The potatoes, called home fries, were reminiscent of something you'd get next to your eggs in the morning but very tasty and the pork, covered in brown gravy, was good just a bit dry.  The biggest let down for me was the paprikash. The sauce was quite thin and a tad bland and the chicken, bits of white meat, was tough and stringy. Mostly spaetzel and chunks of tomato, it just didn't hold a candle to some of the other renditions I've had in the city.  Dessert was another miss. Expecting the ethnic journey to continue with perhaps apple strudel or kuchen, we were instead served up a nearly frozen frosted brownie. Such a bummer. Just a plain, old brownie.  There's no doubting the character and charm of a place like Sterle's. It's dripping with a sense of self that Cleveland has all but nearly lost over the past 20 years or so. As the older generation dies off and the gentrification of the inner-ring suburbs continues, places like Sterle's risk being lost forever. Sure, Sterle's is a bit rough around the edges, stale perhaps. They could use a bit of an update. Sterle's is also a piece of my city that I don't want to lose and a piece of our heritage that deserves to be preserved."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of CLE Yelpers as part of the 2012 monthly International Supper Club night.    With its log cabin like architecture and decor, private expansive parking on E55th, this gem of a place is one of my new found favorite.  As you step inside, and begin this walk down long corridor the lighting increasingly dims and you start to wonder where am I going.  I can imagine such a long corridor provides some much welcome shelter as you wait in line during their famous weekend night festivities or private parties.   Once you step into the main dining room you feel like you have escaped into a warm, mountaintop eastern European chalet with dark wood and many cultural relics hanging on the walls.  You are immediately transported to mood where you are hungry for some coma inducing comfort food.    The food indeed is comfort food.  If you count your daily calorie intake, then leave the calorie calculation out of your records for a meal here.  The food is not drowned in grease but are prepared with butter in traditional eastern European fashion. Wienerschnitzel, Roast Pork, Sausage, Potato, Sauerkraut, Strudel and many other Slovenian ethnic items can be found here.  All served up with the comforting touch of sweet motherly ladies who have the good balance of 'eat it, this is good for you' and 'you sure you want that?' kind of demeanor.  You can tell they might not appreciate smarty aleck but they sure are helpful to those who need advice on what to order.  The family style choice is the best for the first timers or those who want to get a variety of items to try.  The Wienerschnitzel is served crispy without tasting like its drenched in grease.  The Roast Pork with gravy is cooked soft to your palette but still holds its shape well and not at all drenched in salty taste. Sausage is likely steam cooked and come slightly red.  Although this could be misleading to some as undercooked,  let me assure you there nothing undercooked about it.  Its perfect.  Sauerkraut tastes great with its combined taste of sugar, wine, garlic, and salt.  One bite and if you are a Sauerkraut lover, you will not put it down.  Potato this dish is served with sautéed diced potato slightly mashed with bacon bits and butter combined.  This side-dish as well can't be put down once you start.  I'm already starting to crave more as I write this.  I had the apple Strudel,  although I'm not a big fan of this item,  it was an absolute fine finish to my meal.  The accompanying Lasko (Slovenian Beer) was a great pairing to my order.   They also have pitcher of beer as you might expect.  Sterle's is the best choice in Cleveland for Eastern European cuisine that is served up with love for the love of your hunger and comfort for your taste bud.  Sweet, sweet pleasure."}
{"text":"During my life I have seen people quote the Bible to hurt, bring guilt or prove their own superiority over others. Thus, I do not source the Bible when I need inspiration or support. Today I find to review Sterle's, St. Paul best said it. Test all things and retain what is best.   The Cleveland area has done just that with food. Michael and Jane Stern wrote in Saveur magazine that our area has managed to retain an Eastern European heritage and named northeast Ohio one of the best road food trips in America.   Try to find a Slovenian restaurant in Los Angeles or a Croation dinner in New York City. One could find home made Hungarian dinners at any of four Hungarian churches had the Catholic bishop not been allowed to play with an axe.   Rather than lament what Cleveland lacks celebrate what we have. Forget bubble tea, pop beer, cup cakes, and wimpy foods. Go to Sterle's and eat the food that steelworkers ate. Eat the food that women with seven children fed their families. The stuffed cabbage, the goulash and the paprikash fed those who built our bridges, made cars and tires for the world, worshiped at our many churches, and made sure you have a better life.   I go here several times a year and my usual dinner is the combination plate. On my last visit I went with a couple where she is local and he is from Boston. She had not been to Sterle's before but just felt she was in Cleveland eating Cleveland food. He was enthralled. Long after we had finished eating we had to drag him away from the table and the polka band to go home.  I once met a man who is from the glitter of LA and NYC. He says when his friends who doubt his sanity for moving here visit, he takes them to Sterle's. He told me they admit Cleveland has a unique identity.   Sterle's and many other places in our area followed St. Paul by retaining Eastern European food. So should you."}
{"text":"Big portions & food is good. I dug the traditional outfit our waitress had on.. haven't been there in a while though. Hope it hasn't changed too much."}
{"text":"Food for old people! Very old people! I am basing this review off of a single experience that I had today. While the service was just eh, my rating refers specifically to the food I ate today. For the record, I hate to give anybody a bad review, but I can't help myself today.  I happened to catch an episode of DDD last night that showcased Sterle's and raved about it. In another strange coincidence, I happened to be at A1 restaurant supply today that is just up the street, purchasing food truck equipment and they recommended we try Sterle's for lunch. I thought to myself, \"how cool!\", I just saw this place on DDD last night. I was excited!  The place is huge! It's seemingly well kept and the staff, while preoccupied teenagers were nice enough. The menu is small, simple and consists of German/European comfort foods like Paprikash, Sausage, Pretzels, etc... Menu items are over priced, which I don't mind if the food is awesome. To try it our I went for the least expensive item that should be a no brainer and a staple for any German restaurant. And here is where for me, Sterle's goes wrong. The food was BBBoring. I mean really really boring! I ordered the $9.00 Weinerschnitzel sandwich as did my business partner and a couple of house made beers. The beer was ok. The food was tasteless. I can't express exactly how tasteless it was. I've had saltine crackers with more flavor. The tomato had the most flavor of anything on my plate and that's not good folks. Plain white bread, iceberg lettuce, over ripe tomato and a piece of Schnitzel with lays potato chips on the side. Not a terrible combo if anything had flavor. Two words for the cook, Salt & Pepper. The Schnitzel was as it should be, pounded thin and fried. But it was so thin that it was basically just breading and was dripping oil. The whole plate screamed senior citizen or cafeteria food. Needless to say, I didn't finish my meal and hit a drive thru on my way home.  For the price and for the extreme lack of flavor, I will not return unless to have a beer in the Biergarten. If you have kids that don't like spice or are over the age of 70 this may be the place for you! Palettes are like opinions and everybody's is different. For me, this was not food that I will crave anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem in the Cleveland area.   Totally old school comfort food! The best Veiner Schnitzel I have ever had, amazing fried potatoes, awesome apricot and cheese strudel and excellent fresh bread were the highlights of our Sampler meal. For $18.50 you get an amazing meal of soup, salad, 3 entrees, sauerkraut, fried or mashed potatoes,  veggies, coffee and dessert, you cannot beat that deal anywhere!  Top that off with a live band playing oldies but goodies and the treat of seeing several generations of families showing their moves on the dance floor, this is one of the best family dining experiences Cleveland has to offer!  Make a special trip to Sterle's and give them a try, you will NOT be sorry!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere makes this place worth the trip, alone.   Another stop along our Yelp Int'l Supper Club journey across the world, this place was an extremely pleasant surprise. After a lot of strange and somewhat disappointing new cuisines, it was nice to have the comfort of \"grandma's house\" like charm and comfort.   The servers are just the cutest, little ladies, ever. One is (as yelper Matt M so eloquently put it) \"stuffed\" into what looks like a German-ish looking dress, and the two of have that bossy 'tude that you cannot help but smile at. And seriously, even with that, they're super sweet. Honestly, they just want to make sure you leave full and happy.   And then there's the food. We're talking comfort food, people--but the old school, Eastern European kind. It's good, unhealthy and trust me, you wouldn't want it any other way. I'm pretty sure they're known for their Wienerschnitzel, and it was tasty. But I've never had it before, so I'm not sure my opinion counts. My favorites where definitely the chicken soup, the potatoes and the sauerkraut. The salad was just OK with it's bagged, iceberg lettuce mix and red wine vinegar dressing. The veggies were from a frozen mix, but the culture seriously makes up for some of the lesser attractive things.   To reference yelper Matt M just one more time, I could agree more that Sterle's is a super-special place that makes Cleveland a better place. It would be a shame to ever loss it, with it's rich history, charm and nostalgia. And I'm so glad that I'm now in on the secret of Sterle's."}
{"text":"Had a family style dinner at Sterles today! What a great day to spend with family and friends. Service was great and the food was delicious and yummy! Great job!"}
{"text":"Oh my, oh my - I think I'm in love.   My main weakness in life is anything with a lot of culture, especially if that culture comes along with a sassy owner with the best one liners in town!   This place has been on my list to try for YEARS, but I never was able to.  I was thrilled to venture there during a company outing for our Supper Club (copying YELP's idea, of course!)  You truly feel like you've left Cleveland, and the country for that fact, when you walk into this place.  The architecture, decor, beer list - all resemble something a little old world.    To the food.  Lovely Margot told me I'd be stupid to not have the Weinerschnitzel on my first visit, so you know what I did? I listened to her.  I don't have much to compare this to, being that it was my first schnitzel - but YUM!  I highly recommend using the lemon that comes on top ... really brightens the dish up.  It comes with a heap of potatoes, and a salad with homemade dressing or their soup of the night.  The price is high for the neighborhood, but the amount of food you get is almost sickening.  You'll be taking one schnitzel home for sure!   And dessert ... we all showed her how full we were, but she insisted - and we're glad she did.  The strudel was very good!   She brought out two, but cut it up into tiny pieces so we could each have a little sample.  It was the perfect way to end the meal.    I will be back for sure, and not just for the food.  I'm very intrigued that they have a Polka night.  What?  Accordion? Old Men teaching me out to Polka dance? - has to be a hilarious good time."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday night around 7:30pm and although there was a Polka band, the place seemed kind of empty with just a few customers inside. Really enjoy the decor, it made the big space seem warm and gave off this old-world kitschy vibe. We were greeted right away by a friendly young server, but she disappeared for quite a while after dropping off the menus. We could see her on the other side of the room playing on her phone while taking her time cleaning off a table. We sat there so long other servers began to notice and I could see them staring while asking each other about our table. Finally an older woman came over to take out order which I greatly appreciated.   I went with the Feast $18 (wienerschnitzel, pierogies, sausage with kraut, veggies, and garlic mashed potatoes). My date went with the chicken paprikash $16. We both got salads with our meals. Our original waitress showed back up with the entrées and was more attentive after she saw someone else about to take over her table.   Salads were nothing special. Seemed like it was mix that came out of a bag. My wienerschnitzel was large and pretty good (some gravy would have really made it tasty). I also enjoyed the pierogies with sautéed onions (but this was missing the sour cream) and the half a sausage with kraut. Garlic mashed potatoes were just okay, I was not sure if they were real or just had that \"sitting in a crockpot too long\" taste to them. The mixed veggie side was definitely the kind from a frozen bag. The brownie dessert that was supposed to come with my meal never showed up. My date did not mind their dish, but I was not used to chicken paprikash being so red and having such a strong tomato flavor to it (seemed more like a spaghetti sauce). I guess there are different versions to everything, the kind I usually eat has cream in it and the sauce is more orange? colored.  While the loud music did not help with conversation, the polka band did a pretty good job!  I was really excited to finally check out Sterle's and I am glad I did, but my overall experience there was pretty mediocre. This might be a one and done kind of place for me which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I always go to Sterles when in Cleveland.   This is a great place!"}
{"text":"Went to the Southern Tier 5 course beer tasting dinner during Beer Week. Menu was amazing , especially the Duck Confit with the Honey Mustard Spaetzle!! Great talent in the kitchen - keep the special tasting dinners coming! Or better yet, run creative stuff like as daily specials."}
{"text":"This is probably my most challenging review, because this is one of the most unique restaurants I have been to.  A Groupon for 50% off for a party of eight got me in the door with my family.  Upon arrival, there was some confusion about our party (we had reservations), but that got settled.  The ambiance is unique.  The best I could describe it is a combination of one of the restaurants in Frankenmuth, Michigan and an ethnic wedding.  There was live polka music and a dance floor that was only full when polkas were playing.  It looks like most customers are regulars, big family groups.  That being said, we did not feel left out.  Many tables had at least three generations of family members.  Everyone is there for a good time.   We got the family style meal, which was a choice of three \"proteins\" and either dumplings (spaetzle) or mashed potatoes.  Salads, with their house sweet and sour dressing, were good.  The bread and butter were good.  The schnitzel was very good, cooked well without being greasy.  The pierogies (which curiously considered as a protein) were fried, not boiled and a bit crispy.  The chicken paprikash was like none I had ever seen.  Thin, dry, boneless chicken breast with gravy.  The mixed vegetables were burned.  The dessert selection was a variety of pastry, but no apple strudel.  There is a decent beer list, but nothing special.  And then there is the service.  Attentive it is not.  Slow it is.  The confusion about our table was a harbinger of things to come.  Overall, if you are looking for a unique ethnic experience, this is worth a trip.  That being said, you can easily find better ethnic food and service at other locations in the Cleveland area without much trouble."}
{"text":"First of all, there are millions reasons you can give one (potentially no star) to a restaurant. This one star is given to their dishonest and disrespectful service. This review does not imply the food quality (personally I think the food serving amount is good and taste is decent to targeted \"audience\").  So, I decided to call Sterle's to order a pickup using my expired Groupon voucher (which holds the value I paid for as long as the restaurant is there). The lady answered the phone and promised the food will be ready within 25 minutes and confirmed the Groupon voucher was applicable to my order. Then, I arrived on time. The lady who answered my call changed her statement, saying the Groupon voucher is for dine in only. I replied, the voucher is expired, so the voucher simply holds the exact amount of money I paid; the benefits and restrictions of the deal shall no longer hold. The lady insisted we had to dine in to redeem my voucher, so we did.  The story did not end here. We were served with the order we placed 25 minutes ago. My mom and i decided to share the one roasted chicken together due to earlier snacks. By the time we finish, the same lady brought us a new receipt with $1.5 of \"Lunch Sharing\" fee added to our receipt. I was very curious about the charge, so I went up and asked what's the addition fee about. The lady informed me it is added because my mom and I shared one persons meal...  After demanding for a written policy which states this is a rule in the restaurant. The lady decided to take the extra charge off my receipt. Maybe you will not face this situation in this restaurant, but I know that i will not be back again."}
{"text":"Upon my first visit, I immediately fell in love with the decor. The building and art has an authentic look. The staff was friendly and even had a charming accent. My party split an order of Bavarian pretzels, which taste great with the beer batter cheese. I had the Slovenian Sausage and Sauerkraut. It had a great taste, as did the dumplings on the side. Two of my friends had a beer imported from Munich, Germany. They were both very pleased with it. My only complaint is that the prices were a bit high; the cheapest meal was $15. However, if you are looking for authentic food, look no further."}
{"text":"We stopped by Sterle's for lunch today. The service was friendly and attentive and the food was amazing! My sister and I both got the Friday fish fry special - the breading on the fish was unbelievable! Super crispy and flavorful, with tender cod on the inside. Lunch included a stellar soup and salad bar - I was almost too full to eat my entree.   The atmosphere alone is worth it. We will definitely be back to check out polka night soon!"}
{"text":"Please at least go to a place like this before they disappear from the face of Cleveland.  Not saying it is closing soon, but time is not friendly to these types of places.  As generations change, neighborhoods shift, and traditions get lost, these places get rarer and rarer."}
{"text":"I used to think Das Schnitzel Haus had the best schnitzel.  I also used to think they had the best kraut. Wow, I was wrong.  I didn't even know Sterle's existed until I was invited to dinner by family friends.  I don't get out to the Eastside much I guess.    We went on a Friday at 5:30 and I was expecting a wait - No wait!  It's a pretty big place with ample seating - Kind of reminded me of the beer hall at the German festival at the fairgrounds.  Long bench seating, hand painted wall murals, and live polka music.  The atmosphere was fun - a bit loud for conversation but who needs that anyways!  Sterle's offers family style dining for parties of 8 or more so we opted for that (at $20 a person).  It gave us the opportunity to try multiple main courses.  We enjoyed the weinerschnitzel, the chicken paprikash, slovanian sausage, sauerkraut, dumplings, and green beans.  It was all fantastic.  If you can't find 7 friends to take then you can't go family style - too bad for you.  If I had to choose just one dish... (10 minutes goes by)... I wouldn't be able to!  The waitress was friendly, the food came out quickly, and the manager checked in on us multiple times.  They were wonderful.  Round up 7 friends (or hungry strangers) and go here!"}
{"text":"Fifteen of us had dinner at Sterle's (Sept 2014) & won't return!  Schneitzels were dry & over-cooked; the chicken paprikash was tasteless in a thin broth totally unreconizable as a paprikash; spaetzle were hard and dry!  The salad and bread were good!  I was disappointed and embarrassed to have brought my guests to this restaurant.  This is no longer the landmark restaurant it once was - skip it."}
{"text":"I know these people. I've been here before. The waitresses stuffed into the authentic Eastern European dresses, the old timers shuffling to the oom-pah-pah tunes orchestrated by the tired and weathered accordion playing Polish DJ. The scenery is familiar too. The wood paneling, the scenic murals of a far away world printed on the walls, the families joined around the tables for a night of indulgence. The aroma's lofting through the dining room consisted primarily of meat and fermented cabbage; and in the distance, freshly percolated coffee. The smells. They are all familiar. I felt at home.  While I can't claim heritage to the Eastern European influence that Frank Sterle's Slovenian Country House represents, I'm familiar. There's always been a large population in NE Ohio. I'm familiar with the cuisine. I've been to many parties and gatherings in my time that felt exactly like the scene created that night at Sterle's. It was comforting.   For dinner, we opted for the Family Style #1: Chicken Noodle Soup, Salad, Bread, Wienerschnitzel, Roast Pork, Sausage, Vegetables, Potatoes, Sauerkraut, Coffee and Strudel. All for less scratch than a single entrée at the Olive Garden would run you. And with more culture too.   There aren't many places quite like Sterle's around anymore. This place reeks of ethnicity, nostalgia and soul. As long as Sterle's is around, Cleveland is a better place."}
{"text":"Best ethnic food around, great beer, good music and always top notch service.  Delicious, we've been enjoying for a long time."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this place?  Celebrated wedding, anniversaries,  and coutless other stuff here.    We are breaking up.  The food is still awesome, the beer is awesome but the staff is horrible.  Most unatentive and careless staff in history.  Period.  Im not having a bad day nor do I have my panties in a bunch.  I can count the many ways this place has sucked over and over in the past year.  Poslovite....  Good luck on riding the Guy Fieri train for as long as you can..."}
{"text":"Just went for their fish fry. It was an amazing feast of pretzel bites, borscht, salad, fish, dumplings with mushroom gravy, kielbasa, brussels spouts and potatoes. Goldhorn beers on draft and charming polka music played in the background. Go with an appetite for salt, fat, meat and fresh dill."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Food = 4-stars, but with the atmosphere, service, and overall experience, it's a five-star place.  My family are all unabashed Germanophiles.  Each year, we host a huge Oktoberfest complete with Polka band.  ...And the food...  I admit that while we have searched out German restaurants far and wide (Pittsburgh, Philly, DC, Virginia...) we only heard of Sterle's from Guy Fieri.  We made the trip to Cleveland with about twenty family members are were not disappointed for a second.  The family style service is part of the fun.  Passing crocks of soup, piles of schnitzel, heaps of potatoes, and pitchers of beer around the table is part of the experience.  The schnitzel was wonderful.  Tender and crispy.  Sausages were authentic, and the saurkraut is definitely above par.  With the Oompah music from the live band and a dancefloor for the kids (and, after a few beers, the adults), it may be the best place for groups I've found."}
{"text":"I only have one negative comment about Sterle's, but I'll save that for later.  First, the atmosphere is inviting and fun! We walked in to see a giant stuffed animal-looking bear beast who had ribbons tied from his head, and bells around his waist dancing around the place. (Turned out he was Kurent- there to chase winter away. I can get behind that mission!!). There was a polka band that was riffing some Jimmy Buffet tunes, and people all over the place! Kids running around and dancing on the dance floor, rows and rows of tables filled with people and all of them with smiling faces!   Second, the food: we had the Feast and loved it all! There was plenty to go around for everyone, with leftovers to take home. My favorites were the paprikash and Brussels sprouts (amazing!!). Cookies at the end were quite tasty, too.  Third, there was a great beer selection. This makes my husband very happy. They also have a full bar, which makes me  :)   Fourth, the band stops their music to sing happy birthday if you submit a name of a birthday boy or girl. Ours was a birthday celebration, so we did that and the kids loved it!!   Fifth, the service is friendly and speedy. Everyone was so great.  We danced, we laughed, we sang, we ate, and we were so merry! What more could you ask for in a night out with friends?  My only negative about the whole experience is that I wished I'd found out about Sterle's sooner! We will be back, and until then are looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"We had the Sterle's Feast: pierogis, chicken and dumplings, and pork schnitzel with salad, vegetables, mashed potatoes, and dessert. All for under $20! Great deal with amazing service and a polka band for entertainment. I recommend this place for a casual night out !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were planning a weekend getaway to Cleveland and looking for interesting places to eat.  One of the menus I browsed had chicken paprikash on it, which made me remember a TV program I saw featuring a restaurant in Cleveland with homemade chicken paprikash.  A short amount of Googling later, I'd decided we needed to go to Sterle's.  We went there straight off the highway without even checking into our hotel, since we were both really hungry.  It was about 6 pm on Friday night.  I'd known there was going to be a polka band playing, but I hadn't been prepared for exactly how loud it was going to be in that small space.  My husband and I had to yell at each other in order to be heard, and the wait staff must be used to yelling by now as well!  We decided to have the family style meal for two so we could try more dishes.  This costs only $20 per person.  We also decided to add the chicken soup, which is only $1.50 extra.  The garden salad was very plain iceberg lettuce.  What else can I say?  The soup had a very good flavor once you got past the thick layer of schmaltz on top.  Then our main meal came.  We were a little surprised to see that it wasn't actually served family style in bowls.  Rather, each of us got a platter with small servings of everything.    Here's a rundown of what we ordered.  The weiner schnitzel was excellent, the best I've ever had.  (And that's saying something, because I've been to Germany!)  The chicken paprikash came in a bowl and was actually more like a soup.  There was also precious little chicken to be had; it was mostly dumplings and vegetables.  I thought it had a very good flavor, but my husband didn't care for it at all.  The pierogies were really great and were topped with wonderful carmelized onions, but we were a little sad that we each got only two.  We also ordered home fries, which were like no other home fries we'd ever had.  There actually is a similar dish in North Dakota where I come from, but we call it German potato salad.  Unfortunately, I didn't like this dish in North Dakota, and I didn't like it now, either!  For dessert, we were expecting strudel, but instead we each got a small coconut brownie on a paper plate.  By the time we left, the place was really hopping with local people.  Maybe if we'd gotten there a little bit later, and maybe if we hadn't been road weary, this ambience would have been enough to make Sterle's seem like a magical experience.  But judged on food alone, this place is only so-so and seems to be coasting on its reputation."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what happened to this place. I have been coming here for 15 years and it seems to be on a steady decline. The one thing they have going for them is the ambiance. It is a comfortable old-world kind of setting. And when they have music, it becomes a lively place. My main problem is with the service. Tonight I ordered tea before dinner. I asked for lemon and honey. I was told they have no honey. When the tea came, there was no tea bag to accompany the hot water. A while later the tea bag came. Then the salad came and I asked for salt and pepper. My request was acknowledged but the server never returned with salt and pepper. Later, when the entree came, I asked for ketchup and tartar sauce. These things never came either. When I finally made a second request for all the things I neded, the server yelled and said, \"I KNOW, I KNOW...I'M GETTING IT NOW!\"  When she returned, I asked her to send the manager to my table. She replied, \"There is no manager on duty now. And besides there is new management so it doesn't matter anyway.\"  I asked where the manager was; the server told me that he had to go to pick up supplies. I proceeded to the hostess stand to find the manager. I did manage to speak with the manager whose reaction was of a chronic nature; she's heard this story before. She gave me a discount and that was nice.  The food is OK. I don't think I can say more about it. The last few times has been...just OK. This coupled with lousy service, getting yelled at and lied to is certainly a dangerous combination in the quest to retain customers in a lively market."}
{"text":"Probably three stars for the food as a whole. Certain things, however, are five stars. For me, that means the chicken noodle soup because it reminds me of my Serbian grandma's. I also think the goulash is great, especially with veal. A lot of the rest of the menu is competent but probably not the best in Cleveland (not faint praise, given the stiff Central European competition in town). Some items, like the side salads, are pedestrian. On a whole, though, there's no place like it in Cleveland. The long-time waitresses, the costumes, the music... you cannot replicate the atmosphere. The place is for sale, and I fear for its future. Go while you can."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday dinner Service was great even though we had a large group. You get big portions with your meal I had the country house chicken It was good, but I wasn't inspired to think WOW I need to get this dish again. I also had some palacinka, A crepe-like dessert filled with jelly and cream. I liked the crepe part, but the filling was too sweet for me after eating half of it, and the jelly just tasted like some regular Smucker's strawberry jelly to me."}
{"text":"Wow.  Talk about destroying a brand...  This place isn't a shadow of what it used to be.  What a disappointment.  Why mess with success after so many years?  Update (12/23/13): My friends are telling me things are improving here.  Adding a star."}
{"text":"Jason B. really ate a lot of my words and captures what Serle's offers, and my experience was very similar to his.   I went yesterday on Sunday and lucked out: the stuffed cabbage was a daily special. Topped with a bit of sweet sauerkraut, two large stuffed cabbages with a scoop of mashed potatoes. I loved it. for $10 !  The chicken noodle soup was excellent. As Jason V. said, the soup was homemade, the chicken fat on the top. Only vegetable in it was some diced carrots. Long, thin noodles (like those in the campbell's chicken and noodle soup). The entire familywas very pleased with their food [which is actually extremely hard to do, I can't remember the last time that actually happened]. Others had went with the family style, which had very large portions, and well worth the $18/person. Great place to take a large group.   One of the best Eastern European restaurants in Northeast Ohio. There's also a bar that like the rest of the building, has been maintained, but not updated since '65, except for a small TV.   FYI: Check their website before going, their hours are abnormal: only open for lunch on a few weekdays and only for large groups on some weeknights.   There is one thing that needs to be written and deserves mention: The butter packets. These weren't just any Grade AA butter packets that tasted like any other restaurant butter. These butter packets are from Beaver Meadow. Just like the butter's slogan, Everything tastes better with Beaver Meadow.   You'll have to stop by Sterle's, and don't forget to take a taste of Beaver Meadow."}
{"text":"I got the super schnitzel and it was excellent.  If i hadnt eaten before i came i probably cputld have finished the whole thing. Great atmosphere but service was a bit slow but i think that goes with the theme."}
{"text":"The waitress at Sterle's had me at \"I like to sop up the gravy with my potatoes.\"  That was all it took to sway my order to the Sterle Special; schnitzel with mushroom sour cream gravy - comfort food at its best.  I even think my schnitzel edged out the chicken paprikash my husband got as the best thing I ate, and that's saying something, because the paprikash was really good.    Sterle's serves great food without an ounce of irony or pretension. That parsley sprig is on your plate not because they're winking at how retro parsley garnishes are, but because that's the way they've always done it, and what they do, they do with care. The apple strudel, the spatezle, even the salad and bread were some of the best I've had recently.  The atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable, and with the band and the dancing, a little festive; I turned to my husband at one point and said \"it feels like we're at a wedding reception, with much better eats.\""}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. If anything, the food and atmosphere, is very consistent.  It's old world comfort food. Wiener Schnitzel, Mashed potatoes, Apple Strudel, and Polka music. What more can you ask for?  Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives filmed it last year.  Seriously, it worth the look."}
{"text":"This place gets an extra star for ambiance alone! Dined with my family on a Friday night with a live polka band playing. So much fun! Everyone was dancing and clapping along and my Dad even joined in the singing!  The pros: Food was plentiful and delicious! Definitely family-friendly; my one-year-old niece loved dancing to the music.   The cons: Small menu and pricey. Service was lackluster.   Best bet to order: Family feast - skip the schnitzel (too dry) but definitely get the paprikash and their house-made sauerkraut."}
{"text":"Wow. I mean, WOW WOW WOW WOW! This probably got to be some of the best food I ever had. I mean, who knew white folk got food that so ghetto? My friend Stash who a Pole told me about it and he took me here and damn was it good. I am talking fried gravy train heaven. Lots of sausages, pork of all kinds, chicken that is like down south. The people who work their is also real cool. I loved the feel because it made me feel right at home. This is dude food, aiiiight? Know what I'm sayin'? This is the real deal. I'm going back as soon as possible and I'm takin' my main man Clement the tragic mustefino from Nawlins who ride a scootie chair like Paul Prudone. Wow! Try it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love, love, love this place.  They can get quite busy depending upon the time of day and if they are having live music or not.   The food is always a \"cut above\" and the service is generally excellent. (with the exception of one waitress that we try to never get) Not the best part of town but they do have a secure parking lot with a guard keeping watch.   We eat at Sterle's as often as possible.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great! Just order the family sampler...sit back....and prepare to get stuffed! You start with a basic soup and salad..but then you are moving on to succulent handmade sausage, flavorful roast pork, and the most buttery, luscious (And prob high calorie) piece of breaded veal ever to be had! Heaping sides of veggies, potatoes, and sauerkraut accompany the meal and you end with a (thankfully) small, sweet treat.  Whew!  Fun atmosphere (go on a night with live music) where you can enjoy the kinda quirky old world charm of a place straight out of Cleveland's more glorious immigrant past."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting here! It's an awesome environment, love the authenticity and old feel of it! Service was great, food was fast. Don't get soup or salad- these aren't authentic or good, but the schnitzel and the meatloaf were AWESOME! Super good garlic potatoes. Such a hidden gem in CLEVELAND, check it out for sure."}
{"text":"I'd heard of this place, but I had no idea what we were getting into. This isn't your average restaurant -- it's an experience. The Hofbrauhaus has been getting plenty of attention lately, but Sterle's is the original thing. Polka music, a huge dining hall with long tables, and family-style German food.   It's not for the health-conscious, but it was delicious. We had the Bavarian pretzels, which they serve with the most delicious beer cheese I've ever tasted. I got the Wienerschnitzel, which was pretty tasty, with fries, average. The whole table gets a loaf of white bread to snack on while waiting for the meals, and they also brought us little apricot cookies before we left.   It was fun, and got rowdier and rowdier as the night went on, and the dance floor filled up with people dancing to polka. Definitely a family atmosphere. My one complaint was the slow service, and waitress who didn't seem to care. We got there at 5:30 when it was half full, and by the time we left, every table was occupied. So I couldn't really blame the waitress. Still, not a place you want to go for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place!  Four of us went here for dinner on a recent friday night to cash in a groupon, and I wish I had come to this place sooner!  Everything was terrific Sterle's serves up Slovenian and Eastern European comfort food in a festive atmosphere with friendly service.  Although the prices for the entrees are a little high, the portions are very large, so you could eat the leftovers for a yummy lunch the next day.  We ordered the wienerschnitzel, some sort of roast pork and the chicken paprikash, as well as mashed potatoes and a side of green beans.  The wiener schnitzel was absolutely the winner, followed closely by the chicken.    It's not in the best neighborhood, but it's easy to find and has a convenient parking lot.  We saw a sign saying they're planning to open a beer garden there this summer.  Awesome!  The food is great, but the best thing about this place is the atmosphere.  with the old-country chalet feel to the beautiful bright scenic murals of Slovenian landscapes on to the wall, to the ling tables of multiple generations of families enjoying a night out together, to the sweet old couples dancing to the live accordion music on the dance floor, you'll feel like you're crashing a long-lost Slovenian cousin's wedding."}
{"text":"I readily admit, I came to Sterle's because it was on Triple D.  I visited somewhat late on a Friday night.  The restaurant is so huge, it can look empty even when there are a good number of people eating here.  There was polka playing, and some people were dancing.  It looked like a birthday party was wrapping up.    This restaurant is good for kids- they can run around a little on the dance floor and not get in trouble (also they have typical kid's menu items in case they don't like Eastern European foods).  I am not sure why the name of the restaurant mentions Slovenia.  Other than one menu item (Slovenian Sausage), the food appears to be German.  I think Sterle's makes a few things in-house and those things are good.  Other stuff is honestly not so great.  Pro Tip: Don't be scared off by the $18 per person \"Sterle's Family Style Feast\".  When I first saw that, I thought it was only for large parties.  But upon inquiring, I was told that I could order that even though I was just a party of one.  I jumped at it because then I could try both the chicken paprikash and the Weinerschnitzel (both of which were featured on DDD).  You pick three items so I also added pierogies.  The chicken paprikash is the star of the show.  It's chunks of high quality chicken in a tangy, tasty sauce, all over a bed of soft dumplings.  The Pierogies are buttery and tasty and authentic.  The weinerschnitzel is maybe a little on the dry side, but good.  The Feast comes with a side of sliced bread, which I used to soak up some of the extra paprikash sauce (I also put some on the schnitzel).  It also comes with soup or salad and a dessert, and these were the bad side of the experience.  I picked chicken noodle soup and it was clearly from a can (it even had those short thin noodles which are a dead giveaway for Campbell's soup.  For dessert they have apple or cherry strudel or a brownie.  I probably should have gotten the brownie, but the waitress recommended the apple strudel, which was not very good.  I think it was from frozen...  So to sum up- definititely get the chicken paprikash, but be careful with some of the other items, they may not be made in-house and may not be very good.  For $18, I was completely stuffed.  I couldn't finish the schnitzel and took it home in a doggie bag.  I was so full, I didn't eat breakfast or lunch the next day either!"}
{"text":"I had a great dinner.  I wouldn't say it was out of the ordinary, but just a huge helping of comfort food in a festive atmosphere.  I had the Veal Toscana which was like 4 meals in one.  Tasty, cheesy, but pretty standard.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Came here with my man and some local friends after he was done with work.  Started off in the outdoor beer garden. Interesting setup with a long stand up bar/food counter and a bunch of picnic tables and umbrellas in a gravel lot. Not very sexy (don't wear heels ) but the food and beer were excellent. I enjoyed some house smoked brisket, homemade pickles and peppers and several micro brews straight from the outdoor cooler with multiple taps out the side.  This outdoor setup in perfect for a group of friends to come, drink, eat and make lots of noise. Not really the ideal setting for a one on one date. We did not have a chance to sample the Hungarian/Slovakian specialties inside.... maybe next time."}
{"text":"My family is from Cleveland and we have gone to Sterle's for years. Admittedly, the past few years Sterle's became very disappointing. The previous \"meh\" reviews were pretty right on. BUT, we stopped in after the recent Kurentovanje festival... holy smokes! Apparently they replaced the chef, put some money into the place, and wow! They did away with their old menu and now have a fixed nightly menu. Don't worry, the menu is a greatest hits collection ... paprikash, schnitzel, sausage, brussels sprouts (the best I have ever eaten)... In the past, the menu was a mish mash of all sorts of things. This time the food was undeniably SIGNIFICANTLY better. Dare I say, it was great! The service was fast and friendly. If you have been disappointed in the past by Sterle's, try it again. As someone who had lost my loyalty to the place, I am now back on the fan list."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Sterles has recently been purchased by a new owner and I was so excited to come back here for the authentic traditional cuisine they've been known for. We came for the Mothers Day Buffet. It was pork schnitzel, not veal, and it was too dry. It also appeared to be deep fried. The pierogis were deep fried instead of sautéed. There were fried potatoes, scrambled eggs, French toast (no syrup), slices of ham that looked like lunch meat, chicken paprikas, stuffed cabbage.They were missing utensils to serve the food. We had to use the same serving spoon for multiple items. Everything was flavorless, tough and dry.  They one store bought dessert. No variety for the dessert at all.  We asked for gravy and were told they didn't make any today.   We raised the concern with staff and were told the chef left early and everyone in the kitchen were on their own! No offer to comp or discount any of our meals which I felt considering they were aware it wasn't up to par, something should have been done."}
{"text":"Diner, drive-in, or dive? Sterle's is definitely a dive! This place is an old Yugo hall that hasn't been updated since the 1970s. The exterior looks like some sort of religious cult compound and the interior is dark as a bat cave. Expecting an awesome meal at a good value, my buddies and I decided to take Guy Fieri's recommendation. I ended up ordering the schnitzle, which came with a salad and potatoes. My salad bowl was half-full of water and my potatoes were stale and bland. Now on to the schnitzel. Though it was OK, it was nothing spectacular. I have had better schnitzle in food courts for half the price. My meal ended up costing $22, which I consider high for a place of this calibre. I am not cheap, but given how this place has not seen any capital improvements since the Carter Administration, you'd expect better value for money. In sum, Sterle's is nowhere near as good as advertised."}
{"text":"Went to the Easter brunch, they ran out of bacon midway thru and replaced it with fried pepperoni instead. Lamb on the menu but no where on the buffet. All store bought pastries. Called to confirm they had the chicken noodle soup, when we got there they only had spinach, after waiting I was brought out one small dish of what was clearly canned soup that had been Microwaved . The waitress said they had a new chef as a excuse for the poor food, I didn't know their chef was Campbell's canned soup. If you think about here just save yourself the money and go to McDonald's, you'll get higher quality food."}
{"text":"We held a reception in Sterle's banquet room and it could not have been any better.  Jill, the catering manager could not have been more helpful or accommodating.  I felt that the prices were very reasonable and everyone loved the food. We served appetizers and chose a dinner buffet of roast beef, pierogies, sausage & kraut, mashed potatoes, and vegetables.  Everyone raved about it and there was plenty.  The sausage is made by a local butcher per their old secret recipe.  Pierogies were also home made. Here are a few other points that I really liked: *Set up-we dropped off fresh flower arrangements and special serving ware.  All was set up per our directions and looked beautiful.  They also provide some mason jar arrangements that you can use, but we brought our own. *Room has a small dance floor and music system.  You can bring in an IPad or IPhone loaded with your Pandora playlist and party music is taken care of. *Room had projector and screen.  Bring in your photo presentation and they will take care of you. *Friday nights -  a Polka band plays in the main dining room where you are welcome to go out and dance. *Bring in your cake - they will set up your cake table, offered to cut the dessert, and provided take home containers for the remaining desserts.  We also brought in a cookie jar with homemade cookies and chocolate from Lily's without a problem. * Buffet - set up on time and were attentive. *White table cloths provided at no charge.  I think some places try to nickel and dime you on things like linens.   *Buffet - plenty of food that was yummy and they provided containers that allowed guests to take home the leftovers. *Patio- if the weather would have been warmer, we could have enjoyed the patio off of our room. *Non-alcoholic champagne-while they do not offer it, they allowed us to bring in some of our own for toasting. *Cute little chalkboard signs were provided to designate the cake table, gift table, etc. *Private parking lot had plenty of room for our guests. *Room will seat 125 guests."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went last Saturday to celebrate a birthday.  I had made reservations beforehand, which was probably a good thing since I was a little surprised at how crowded it was.  We were greeted promptly and waited only a few minutes for our table.  I got their signature cocktail which I would definitely get again, packs a punch. We all loved our food choices, except for one who thought the pork was a little on the tough side.  I got the chicken parpikash and thought it was very good.  And, the polka band playing made it such a fun evening.  We all said we would go back again.  It had been about 8 years since I had dined there."}
