{"text":"First review I've written in a really long time, and it pains me to put down a restaurant of one of my own, but my visit to Copper Kettle Curry House on my recent visit to Phoenix was nothing short of the hugest disappointment.   I walked in one evening and found the place completely empty, save the disinterested host sitting behind the front counter scrolling through his smart phone. I asked him I'd like to order some dishes for dinner, but he insisted I have their nightly dinner buffet instead. I should have walked over to the buffet counter first before saying yes, because what a mess. Most trays were either almost empty or had obviously been sitting around for too long with a re-stir, and everything looked cold, especially the keema (minced meat). The selection was poor, and the dishes were mediocre, and I was trying to figure out what happened to these guys. When Copper Kettle was in Mesa, it was *the* go-to spot for many of the Valley's Pakistani community. I'd taken friends there for grilled platters and whatnot over the years. And service was excellent (albeit that excellent server is now at Curry Corner).   Dining here was depressing. Apart from the fresh hot naan which was brought out (which made me scratch my head as to why everything else in the buffet seemed cold and stale), I didn't really feel any enthusiasm for anything on my plate, which is pretty much a first for a Pakistani restaurant. Nothing, even the safe veggie options, merited going back for seconds, because everything was cold. And old. It's like all effort and drive had left this operation. Not to mention the fact that two tables over there was a giant mess on the table, booth seats, and floor: spilled sauce and rice and water everywhere. The guy at the front obviously wasn't vested in cleaning it up, as he for the most part stayed interested in his phone, so the mess just stayed there the entire time I ate.   I was probably in and out of the restaurant within 15 minutes. Not a good sign whatsoever for these guys, especially if the much more brightly lit Indian Delhi Palace is right next door.   As I said, it's not out of snarky glee that I'm writing this 2 star review. I'm writing it more that I'm really disappointed, because given the name and the brand, I was expecting much better. Hopefully Copper Kettle will take this review to heart and clean up their act and create a loyal fanbase like Khyber Halal has a few miles away, because from the looks of things at the moment, it appears they've given up before they even truly got started.  Best of luck.  2 stars (for the decent hot naan)"}
{"text":"I was actually headed to the Indian buffet across the street, and then I saw a sign for the Curry House $6.99 buffet.  I absolutely love the Indian buffet across the street, but I have been going there for about a decade, and I didn't mind trying something new - especially since the new buffet was $3 cheaper than my old standby.  I have never tried a Pakistani buffet, but I figured since Pakistan and India are neighboring countries that the cuisine would be similar.  I have been trying to expand my culinary horizons locally, and I am generally a pretty adventurous eater after having lived overseas for two years (Europe and the Middle East).  Also after having tasted these ethnic foods in their place of origin, I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what things \"should\" taste like.  I actually hate leaving bad reviews, because I don't like to jeopardize people's livelihoods, so let's look at this as constructive advice so that the owners can make improvements and bring customers in because of the improved quality in the near future.  So, I will start with a positive.  The chicken tikka dish was delicious.  The chicken had an interesting dry rub, and it was full of flavor - not dry, not overcooked, not undercooked - just right.  The second positive comes with a slight criticism.  The naan was delicious too - nice and warm and crispy.  However, of all of the Indian buffets I have been to (which is at least 6 or more), none of them charged extra for naan.  This place charged extra, but considering the low buffet price, I acquiesced and ordered it - especially since I had expected it as part of my meal, and I didn't want to go without.  It was less than a dollar, but still I felt like it should have been included.  Now for the criticism.  The restaurant smelled, not of delicious aromas coming form exotic spices, but more like mildew.  At closer inspection, it looks like they suffered some pretty major water damage from the recent storms.  It seems as though a  portion of the ceiling had caved in and the ceiling tiles were removed.  They used a freestanding room divider to divert your attention from the building damage.  The place was not particularly clean.  My table and chairs were not very clean.  They also had a chemical odor to them.   The chicken curry was room temperature (not hot) and was very bland.  The chicken itself was OK, but nothing special.  The goat curry was very bland, and the goat meat was mostly fat.  The vegetable dish had overcooked zucchini; it was mushy and virtually tasteless.  It was also oily.  The garbanzo bean stew was bland and not worth trying again.  The rice was not very fresh, even though I think I was the first customer of the day, and I bit down on an uncooked piece of rice that was so hard I thought that I had chewed on a small pebble.  The dessert was jello - no thanks, I can make my own jello.  They also had watermelon, which would have been great if it looked fresh, but it didn't so I didn't risk it.  And I am saving the worst for last.  They served \"noodles.\"  I have never had \"noodles\" before at an Indian buffet.  But, I figured, that maybe Pakistani cuisine might have noodles, and that is what makes them unique from a typical Indian buffet.  Well, I don't think that noodles are typical to this region, as they just tasted like over-boiled spaghetti noodles - the worst I have ever had.  And, I went to summer camp for 9 years with some of the worst spaghetti on the planet.  This was even worse than that.  After one bite,  I knew that they just put noodles on the buffet to fill out the space and to make it look as if there were more offerings.  They would have been better off just leaving the tray empty.  Right now, If you plan to go to this buffet, I wouldn't.  HOWEVER, if the owners read this and take it to heart, not as a criticism, but rather as constructive advice on how to fix this, then this place could be great.  I don't want to see any business fail; there are too many out-of-work people already.  I would also love to have a nice ethnic restaurant in the neighborhood that I can go to on occasion for  a little variety.  The recipes desperately need tweaking.    The maintenance of the building and the tables, chairs, and floors needs to be reassessed and fixed.  The naan should be included in the price of the buffet, and keep the chicken tikka exactly as it, because it is what earned you a second star.  I would love to read more reviews to see if they have fixed these issues in the future, because I would love to give this place a second chance if they actually institute these recommended changes.  If they don't change something soon, I am afraid that they won't be around for very long."}
{"text":"The amount of oil used in the cooking is beyond ridiculous. Mexican cook for indian cuisine? Really? My wife got diarrhea 1/2 after eating food. Enter at your own risk"}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 2 stars for service.  Went on a Tuesday night at 6:30 and we were the only ones there. Fine by me. One young man there, sitting at a table watching a Bollywood movie on the TV. No welcome, nothing. We sat down at a booth and he finally walked over. \"Would you like menus?\" \"Um, yes please\". He tried to direct us to the buffet, but we wanted to go ala carte. Back to his movie. When he brought our food, he set it on the table and walked away. \"Um, may we have some plates and utensils please\". \"Oh, sure\". The whole evening was like that. Just disinterested and aloof. Weird.  Food was really good, though. Wonderful Kabli Chana (chick peas and potatoes in butter, masala, coriander & other spices. Dal (lentils in garam masala) was a little spicier than we asked for, but smoky, rich & delicious. Onion-stuffed naan and Saada rice were really good, too.  So, maybe we go back, but if we do, we take-out."}
{"text":"A large selection of Curry for their lunch and dinner buffet.  This is the second location for this restaurant, the place boasts the best indo Pakastani cuisine.  I don't have anything to suggest right now because im new to this type of food.  Copper Kettle Restaurant is a clean quite place."}
