{"text":"Most expensive tap beer I have ever bought in Arizona. I have lived here 16 yrs and have never paid $6 for a draft beer.  Beer is cheaper in Arcadia, Biltmore and Old Town.  I thought the bar was nice but not sure how you can charge that in a college town."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today, there were only two other groups in the whole restaurant. Took 45 minutes for the food to come out. Asked for my burger cooked medium, came out well done, and pretty cold. Would not recommend based off the food or service."}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous!! Every burger I've ever had has been delicious and the drink selection is great. They have a relaxed vibe and I love the games you can play. Great place to watch a game or just chill ans drink."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the lodge it was in Scottsdale and got the Sasquatch burger.  It was very yummy.  It was a very nice place.  I went to the one in Tempe the other day and the building looked new and very inviting.  My boyfriend and I were told we could sit anywhere we wanted so we sat. 
                                  NOW THE SERVICE
It was not that great.  It took us a lot longer than I thought it should have taken to get asked about what we wanted to drink.  When she came to take our order it seemed to us that we were putting her out.  It was like how dare they ask questions.  Maybe she was having a bad day or something.  It was game day but still no excuse. 
I don't want people not to go because the food is very yummy."}
{"text":"My brother and I had called in prior to coming down from central Phoenix on February 25th, for a viewing event. We were told that we would not need ID's to get in through the front door by a women on the phone. When we got there we were told that we did need to have our ID's by the bouncer with the mohawk. I informed him that I did not have my ID and about the misinformation we had received on the phone and he let us take our seats. We found our table but had been passed by several different waitresses multiple times without any service. But our front-door and food experience made up for this. I ordered the Pretzel Burger with Shoestring fries and both were BOMB. My brother mentioned to me that he enjoyed his burger he ordered as well. The viewing parties are definitely something that we would be interested in coming back to. And I definitely have to try the Sasquatch burger one day."}
{"text":"OMG this was the worst service I have had in a long time. Our waitress was friendly enough but we had to flag her down every time we wanted to order anything and when we wanted the bill (but still had to wait 20+ minutes for that). Then she forgot what we ordered and had to ask us before bringing us our bill (not a huge deal...). It was more annoying waiting 30+ minutes between getting our drinks! :(. My BF's burger came out well done when he ordered it medium rare, so that was a bummer as well. On the plus side the ambiance is cool so if they address the service issue I would think of going back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the lame reviews are about.  I have been here a few times and had the Habanero Burger, and the Pulled Chicken Sandwich.  I thought they were both excellent.  Food came out hot and tasty.  The manager, Justin, was really nice and wanted to make sure everything was great.  I will be back and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"From the first time I went to the new Lodge in Tempe, all of the staff was very friendly.  Everyone introduced themselves and made a point to find out my name.  When I came back a few days later, I was warmly greeted by the staff and some even remembered by name - wow!

I have alway been helped promptly and when I order food it comes out very quickly.  

I have enjoyed the food that I have ordered.  I try to eat healthy and when ordered burgers or chicken sandwiches without bread they always get the order correct and don't seem to mind the special order.  

I really enjoy the cobb salad an green chili.

The outside is large and I cannot wait for the weather to cool off so I can enjoy the fireplace."}
{"text":"Service REALLY needs attention and not sure if I would go back.  Ordered a drink at the bar and asked if service was available on the patio.  Was told yes.  We sat on the patio and was NEVER approached again."}
{"text":"This is the funnest, cutest, & best-food place ever.  22 Big Foots decorating the place inside & out, with buffalo heads, antler chandeliers, & other cute decor.   For the novelty of it, we ordered the signature  Sasquatch Sandwich which is two Texas Toast grilled cheese with several thick cheeses inside (that's 4 pieces of Texas Toast,) with a grass-fed burger in the middle with onion straws, bacon, and the works.  It must be nine inches high with this giant steak knife sticking out of the top of it making it about 18 inches high.  Got the sweet potato fries to go with.  PERFECTION.  They have a big enclosed patio outside which makes a great atmosphere.  Really a fun fun place."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  Low-key gem that no one really knows about yet.  Fun backyard games outside.  Bartenders, waitresses, and bouncers are all super cool and down to earth.  Their"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  After watching and episode on Diners, Dives and Drive Thrus, we went to check it out.  Ordered the Habanaro burger, it was overcooked and just not at all what we watched Guy eat.  Ordered the green chili pork, which was tough and just nothing special.  Hard to beat the Roaring Fork's green chili.  Also ordered the breakfast burrito.  It came out luke warm and the main ingredient was potatoes.  So disappointed!  It was my first and last time to this place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the d√©cor matches the food perfectly! But the server we got was way to busy and was not helping us out so we kept having to ask the nice manager or girl who sat us @ first she had a smile on the hole time. I spent a lot of money for poor service but I'll go back one more time. 
Foods really good! 
Clean! 
Love all the TVS for football!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, but mostly college aged environment. TV volume was so loud you can't even talk. Only had appetizers.  Pretzel and cheese were ~meh, forget the onion rings.  Mostly greasy batter, couldn't even see or taste the onions. Fried pickles were good.  Didn't want to spend any more money especially since I wasn't too impressed with the appetizers.  Parking sucks if u don't get there early. Wouldn't take someone here on a first date (or second for that matter) Over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"5 star place great food and big patio to have this amazing viewing party thanks for taking care of us last night for Nick Chasteen lionfight 26 fight"}
{"text":"NO STARS
This place needs lots of help before I will go back. Bad attitude lousy service with marginal food is a strange way to market your product. I know they want to be a dive bar, but REALLY!   
 This is not a restaurant, not sure what it is, a bar or a playground. A bacon burger has no bacon, waffle fries were regular fries, and shoe string onions were a slice of a raw white onion. My medium cooked burger was raw, and my cup of soup came out five minutes after I  received my meal. So drink a lot before you order, and maybe it wont matter as much.             
I write reviews when I the food and service is bad and management doesn't care enough  about its customers to train their employees."}
{"text":"Tried a new brunch spot today with no regrets. The Lodge has a cabin-like outdoor feel to it, yet it's conveniently located just off of Mill Ave and easy to get to by car or bicycle. Great, friendly and welcoming service. We shared the Bachelor Gulch Skillet breakfast (a man's breakfast!), and the Lumberjack French Toast, which truly is just a delicious dessert for breakfast. Too much to finish! Would definitely give the Lodge another go. 

Bonus -.Bottomless mimosas $10 +$ .5 refills. Even if you only get two... Worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and sweet potato tots! The Sasquatch burger is a fun one to share with someone... You'll see why. The service is great, very attentive servers. Plus the whole restaurant is like a giant cabin so it's a fun vibe! Been there a few times and will continue going! Oh and did I mention they have patio games"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The manager actually came out and told us we \"handicapped\" his restaurant. The place was completely empty when we entered. We called for a reservation of 25 and they accepted. The waitresses didn't greet the table for 20 minutes. Then finally arrived and didn't know how to manage a group. Nobody came to get out orders. Finally when they did they were so unorganized. Drinks were delivered an hour after we sat down. Then food trickled in an hour and a half later. Made our party 30 min late for the ASU basketball game when we arrived at 5:15pm. (Game was at 7 and we finally got into the game at 7:40...). I will never support an establishment that says that customers are a handicap. Maybe teach your servers how to handle a group and enter orders as you take them... restaurant 101. And to the bald manager that had to complain about our group actually making your restaurant some money... learn some people skills. You are terrible."}
{"text":"Yikes. My new wife and I chose the Lodge for our day-after Wedding brunch, and we really regret doing so.

We had a group of 12, and the service was an absolute nightmare. Our server(s) didn't take our order for 30 minutes after arrival, and the food didn't start coming out for an hour after that. Only half of our party received their food, so the server blamed the kitchen and took our orders again. She needed to come back to the table 3 times to confirm the order -- it felt like we were speaking another language. Two hours after sitting down, two members of our party (myself include) still didn't have any food, so we begrudgingly canceled our order.

The manager came over to apologize and offered us a (modest) discount, with some 15% off coupons for a later visit. With such a frustrating experience, we felt the entire meal should have been comped.

On a normal day, this might have been something we could overlook, but this experience will be something we always remember as part of our wedding weekend -- a small (but fortunately, insignificant) stain on an otherwise perfect weekend -- so I wanted to caution other folks thinking about bringing a large group to celebrate a special occasion at this establishment."}
{"text":"I came here around 7 on a Tuesday, obviously the vibe is much less bar and more laid back. There was plenty of seating available and the staff appeared to be even distributed.

Despite being adequately staffed, it was difficult to get our waitress to come by without flagging her down.

I had the citrus kale salad and while the ingredients paired well together, there was way too much dressing. 

The price was decent, average for a place like this.

Overall this place wasn't bad for a bar, I wouldn't choose to come back."}
{"text":"I actually REALLY like this place.  One of my new favorites, it's casual and the food is actually really good.  They have some healthy options also.  The chopped cobb salad is very good.  The well drinks are $3 during HH...can't really beat that.  They also have Big Buck Hunter which is a bonus!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great environment, inside and out on the patio. It's got so many delicious beers on tap and amazing food! I'm always impressed with the experience, and the service is great! I usually go here during the day, so it's nice and chill! Seems to be a little known treasure of downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"Few friends convinced me to meet up with them to grab drinks a few weeks ago, now we go every week. Food and service are good. Great prices for drinks. Definitely the spot for happy hour. Try \"the Lodge\" beer."}
{"text":"This place has a really fun atmosphere and good beer selection. Our family had mixed reviews about the food although it looked good!! My sandwich was slathered with so much mayo my bun was soggy. My dad got the Sonoran dog who is CRAZY about hot dogs- no snap to the dog. Also, the one high chair they had was in use and no diaper changing station. I would give it another try!"}
{"text":"I have been in 4 times in the past 10 days. Twice for dinner, once for lunch and once for a large group event. Every time the staff at the Lodge nail it! The wings and Cobb salad are my favorites. Also have an awesome selection of appetizers including delicious pretzels. You also have to try and leave room for dessert. I have sat at the bar and at tables and the food comes out fast and hot every time."}
{"text":"Coldest beer I ever had in my life. Had an 805 on tap. Ordered a taco salad. Was a bit spicy for me and way too may olives and bell peppers. Food served to people next to me looked good. I will try something else next time. Service was o.k.."}
{"text":"Good burger, drink specials was there a week ago and it was on point. Tucked away behind ASU/Marina Heights area but great place to get together with a small or large group. Happy Hour is from 3-6 Monday -Friday."}
{"text":"We were in town to take in a couple spring training games over the weekend. Friday evening started out with a 'plan' to dine at Culinary Dropout on a Friday night (without a reservation or knowing what we were in for - Duh....) .... Found out we would have an hour and a half wait to get in.  

Quick decision was made to find out what 'The Lodge' was just down the street (within a very short walking distance.) What a GREAT decision that turned out to be!!  The food was over the top! My husband had the Rodeo Burger, our friends ordered the Cubano and shrimp tacos to split, and I ordered the crispy chicken wrap. WOW!!!  BTW:  the drinks were amazing - and we rolled our way out of there feeling super pampered by our server, Julia. Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Went in earlier today with the family. Wife's order got messed up, long story short, ended up taking her order to go. Got home only to find a hair on the toast that came with her order? 

P.s. Bavarian pretzels were delicious.

Not sure we will be coming in again. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Will not be back, based on the service. All of the servers, security , and bartender were just hanging out. They were either hanging out with the guests or each other. We had to grab someone to seat us. 
Bartender called out a guy, yelling \"we have a yelper here, make sure you are very nice to him and kiss his butt\" then walked away and said f'ing cock sucker. 
We ordered a burger that came out very dry, so not even the food could make the experience better.  
All in all, the level of professionalism was lacking. It's a party place and the workers are part of the party."}
{"text":"Back in town after the Tempe fair to try some food. The burgers just aren't as good as their last location in Scottsdale. We tried the regular burger with bacon, cheese, etc, but no grilled cheese buns. It didn't have that wow factor anymore. The chicken wrap also could use some updating as they shove most of the chicken in the front of the wrap and it all falls out before eating. So you eat that chicken with a fork and then when you bite into the wrap, it is mostly lettuce inside. Not worthy of the $10 price tag. The place was a morgue compared to the Yard on a Saturday evening, so perhaps others are noticing as well."}
{"text":"We were a party of two for lunch. The place has nice decor and is comfortable. The service was good and attentive. I had the sirloin chili. It was excellent. I also had onion rings, which were OK. The batter was a little too chewy. It seemed under cooked. The prices were reasonable. I plan to visit the place again."}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive  service. Good wings although I would like to see more variety, excellent salad .  We will def be back"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem in Tempe!  Such a cool atmosphere with decor that makes you feel like you're up north. We tried the lodge mule on happy hour ($6) and the barbecue chicken Sammy and the pretzel bun burger. All Delish. Best part was the fried pickles!!"}
{"text":"Went for the weekend brunch and to try the restaurant for the first time since this location's been here for a while. The food was just fine, but the 'regulars,' customers that the manager seemed to know well from frequent visits, were harassing the servers and made the experience less than pleasant. These regulars literally monopolized the time of the one waitress working the entire restaurant, in addition to making inappropriate comments to her and the other servers coming in for their shifts. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"$10 for a small handful of bad tasting cheese curds. Yikes! Won't be back. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars because the drinks and food were so awesome! Seriously one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had! And the place looks great! Fun atmosphere, it looks clean, but the draw back is the fact that we spent most of our time protecting our food and drinks and trying to kill the seemingly endless army of fruit flies that kept trying to share our meal  .......by the end of our meal,  my husband had killed at least 7. Several more got away.  Unfortunately,  because of that,  we won't be going back.  But if you're ok with constant swatting, and potential health risks from obviously unclean surroundings, then I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place. No idea why they have bartenders that think they are better than customers. Been there done that. 
Unfortunately I think it is just the youth that think they are cool.
I bartended at a place where I had no time to even drink water.  Please hire people that will make your business grow not ruin it"}
{"text":"The cheese curds, the chili dog, and the pretzel with beer cheese are all awesome! I actually crave their chicken tortilla soup at least a few times a month. Everything is fresh and always good! Love this bar"}
{"text":"Best wings in town, and great burgers! Great atmosphere and good place to go if you want to have a drink and relax with friends or family."}
{"text":"Very mundane food. Heard others say they liked it. Avoid the way overpriced beef dip."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Bar help is first class.  Only complaint would be the music.  They used to play classic rock and now?  Not sure what this is?  Can we go back to Rock?  At least on Monday nights?  The State Farm crew would appreciate it."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch football and drink beer - lots of great spaces to watch TV or play games too.  The service was great, the atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable and the drinks were reasonably priced.  The food actually looked surprisingly good too!"}
{"text":"Get the sweet potato fries with the house dip, you won't be disappointed if you like a dessert."}
{"text":"Good food, decently priced. Tons of quality draft selections, atmosphere is one of the best around. Service is iffy depending on the server, either really good or nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is definitely more for drinks than food. We had a good assortment of apps and other things and I wasn't overly impressed with any of it. The waffle fries were probably the best part. We ordered the chicken and waffles sandwich. The waffles were undoubtedly Eggo. 

The place also felt a little on the dirty side. Our server was sweet (it was her first day) and for the most part attentive. If we come back, it will be for drinks only."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Each time the food was good and the service very attentive. The decor is pretty cool and fits the theme for sure.

I will be back."}
{"text":"I love the layout of the new location, however, the food was disappointing. I ordered the LSK burger with a side of macaroni and cheese. My friend ordered some chicken and waffles sandwich. My burger was okay. Nothing I come back for. The macaroni tasted like tuna helper. The chicken sandwich was clearly made with an eggo waffle. I feel like the food in Scottsdale was way better than it is now. I don't know what changed. The location is kind of hidden so if you want people to come back you gotta be as good as all of the other options in the area. I would come back for the atmosphere and drinks but The Lodge will not be a top choice in the future."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance. I love the wood everywhere, almost feels like you're in the mountains of Colorado. The outdoor space is awesome though I sat at the bar. The bartender was awesome and very attentive. He was very fast and checked in on us constantly. I hate when establishments leave dirty dishes on tables but you won't find that here. I got the salmon with the steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. Salmon was mediocre and forgettable. I shared it with my friend who seemed to love it. It just didn't have seasoning and was mildly dry. The veggies were very good and the potatoes were potatoes. They didn't have gravy and I'm from the south so I need my gravy!!!!! I take seasoning very seriously thus the lack of stars. Food must have a taste to it! The salmon could have used some sauce or something"}
{"text":"Always enjoy time at the Lodge. Great bar to watch the games. Friendly staff and solid bar food."}
{"text":"I like this place the times I've been here. Great patio and a welcome break from the usual Mill ave bars."}
{"text":"I found this place by googling \"cocktails Tempe\". I rarely drink these days, but it was a special occasion and I wanted to sip on something other than beer to celebrate. I should have investigated a little more thoroughly online. For some reason I assumed that they would have an extensive cocktail list (I guess because they have 90+ kinds of whiskeys), and that maybe they would have some unusual offerings. But the menu has 8 cocktails, all very familiar (margarita, dark & stormy, old fashioned, etc.) I ordered a whiskey sour and it was surprisingly good, better than I expected. It had a sort of floral aftertaste, and it wasn't super sweet like some sour mixes tend to be. We also ordered some appetizers to pick at - great waffle fries and fried pickles (hard to mess those up). We hadn't come for food, but I did glance at the menu to see what was offered. They are pretty light on vegetarian options, so I'm not sure we would ever make it back for dinner. 

The vibe of the place was cool if you're into a \"lodge\" feel. Lots of taxidermied animals on display, which is cool to look at if you don't think about it too much. I wanted to imagine that these stuffed deer and bears came second hand, purchased on eBay from people who were getting rid of their deceased father's hunting trophies, rather than putting money directly into the pockets of people who make a business off of killing animals for sport, but on second thought... it's probably just wishful thinking. So again, we probably won't make it back here again. 

Our server was really attentive and friendly. Overall it was a good experience, just not the most welcoming atmosphere for vegetarians and animal lovers."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  Not enough tables inside.  The bartender could take a minute from stocking the bar to wait on customers, clean off the ONE table that was available, or even make me a drink.  We literally stood around for at least 5-10 minutes and finally we left.  We WONT be going back.  I would give it negative stars if possible.  Don't waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"No other words than awesome! I was visiting from Seattle on business and came to the lodge with a group of 10 people from all over the country. The hostess seated us right away and was very sweet. Our server, Kenny, was incredibly attentive and although we were all over the place with our orders, he got every single detail right! The food was SO GOOD! Perfect combo of innovative and comforting. The atmosphere here is second to none. The interior design is beautiful, the music is great, the staff is really laid back but attentive. Kudos to the owner, manager, and chef of this establishment!"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner.  This is our 3rd time here.  Evan was our server.  You could tell he was busy but still refilled drinks and checked on us periodically.  Super friendly.  Great smile.  We had the nachos with chicken on tater tots.  Highly recommend. Our son had the Hamburger on pretzel bun.  He said it was very good and done just as he asked.  The waffle fries were cold but tasted like they would have been good when fresh.  However, we didn't say anything because we just weren't that hungry.  I feel confident they would have made it right.  The first 4 pictures are from our first visit."}
{"text":"This place is so stinkin' rad. Religiously went to the one that they closed in Scottsdale and I'm so stoked they opened the one in Tempe! The menu is pretty much the same and the vibe is awesome. The patio will be perfect for the cool months here and the misters are a game changer for the summer. Best patio by far in the area. Their food is so good but I do have to say, put the fried pickles back on the menu. Pretty please? I'd recommend if you go, you also get a Lodge beer. Cheap and delicious brew. I'll be back again, and again."}
{"text":"Yeah, no. Wait staff accommodating, generous portions, but mediocre food. Burger was cooked to order but needed doctoring with salt and pepper. Friend had the Chicago dog which was over cooked and lost on the bun; ordered the Sasquatch sampler plate for appetizer, the jalape√±o peppers sported overcooked bacon and a cold cream cheese filling. Prices are comparable to the Tempe bar scene.

Bottom line probably a great bar scene late night and weekends, but I won't be back for the food."}
{"text":"Great Time. Delicious drinks, better service. Highly recommended! I went here thinking I was gonna have a drink for my birthday and I had several and met great people. Awesome time, I will be back"}
{"text":"I'm a local, and a regular yet tonight was the shittist service ever! Aside from a group stealing half my groups table with the help of the staff, and without asking if I need the chairs. I was never offered water, they didn't appear until after I ordered my drink from the bar, and honestly I don't think I will have any future events here. Normally service is a 4, but I severely downgrade the service tonight."}
{"text":"First time here and checking it out for lunch. I want it to be good! 
If I was a business owner, I would welcome honest feedback from my guests.

Here with a party of 6. Ordered food water and a few beers.

Water appeared within the blink of an eye from an astute gentleman. Keeper!

The space is wide open and just as \"log cabin\" as the Old Town Scottsdale's recently departed predecessor and big and smells of freshly cut lumber...

Yeah, that's right, friends; breathe it in. Breathe... it... in.

Our bartender was attentive and laid back. He took our order for our drinks again, 30 minutes after our order and delivered the goods immediately. He's a keeper.

Just got the lemons at 11:41 that we requested with our water.

A friend of mine had the salmon and it was \"exquisite\"; That's for you, Sydney. ;]

The fish really was cooked perfectly and the sauce and crisp vegetable pairing was very enjoyable. 

Come here if you want good food.

I love to see new businesses thrive which is why I offer my honest feedback!"}
{"text":"Food was great!  I had the Chicago dog with sweet potato fries which was amazing.  Took about 35 minutes to get a sandwich and a hot dog otherwise would have rated 5 stars. Manager gave discount for poor service so they addressed it."}
{"text":"Golden Tee machine is beat up. Tell your vendor to fix your trackball if you are going to charge people $5 for a game of live. 

Thanks for wasting my money."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place, was heading across the street but there was no parking.  Very happy with the surprise find.  Food was outstanding, service was exceptional, yes a bit pricey for being a college bar but I their specials were good.  Overall very pleased with the experience, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about the food here.  Everything I try is fantastic and it's not too hard on the old wallet.  I would say that I definitely prefer it to culinary dropout across the road."}
{"text":"This place needs a little work with management, or need to hire more people. It took an hour to get our food tonight, and when we ordered another beer, it never came. It's too bad because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Our first time today.  The service was good and so was the food.  The marshmallow dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries is off the hook."}
{"text":"Wow. This place truly lives up to not being much of anything. From the 'rough carved' sasquatch family in front to the decidedly not family atmosphere inside it manages to be spacious but yet cramped. Games area outside is right next to an area that would probably be a great stage for live music but is overtaken by a lounge? Or maybe just an uncomfortable seating area? The food is mediocre but expensive. I had iceberg lettuce on a $12 burger that tasted like neither habanero nor parmesan! The green chili pork was bland (my mom would probably think it was spicy, but this is occupied Mexico). 

The 'craft' beer menu is about as pedestrian as you can get with nothing truly interesting. Which doesn't matter because a frozen beer glass freezes the water in your beer anyway, why even have quality beer if you are going to destroy it before it even gets to me?  The 'lodge tea' is large (16oz) but tastes too much like the flavoring in flavored vodka, very chemical flavor. Not sure if the wood smell is piped in or what but the place smells like treated lumber. Music was just awful...bro-country mixed with contemporary pop bs. The huge tvs make everything seem even more cramped and it is impossible to hear the people sitting next to you."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday Football and Brunch! Everything's new and clean, patio is open, and decor is super fun - wood, cabin feel. Food is yummy!"}
{"text":"We ended up here because we couldn't get parking for a different restaurant across the street.  We were looking for a venue for a lunch meeting, and decided to try this out.  This venue really is more suited for the college drinking crowd, but at least they had an extensive menu.

Service was slow - one server, nice but no hustle. We really appreciated the accommodations for making our burgers and sandwiches a bit healthier.  Burgers are good.  I had to try their cheese curds on my burger (yeah - I wasn't the one trying to be healthy! Yummy - but not something you want to do every day).  Lots of choices for fries, salads, burgers, sandwiches. They are very accommodating for bringing extra condiments.  

Fun place to try on a weekend or happy hour, but not something I would recommend for weekday lunch."}
{"text":"I knew going that service was going to be bad. So I was prepared. But man was the service painful. First rule I have is I expect the server to check on my food be sure it's okay. Also I expect a drink refill. I also expect them to come back when I'm done eating to see if I want desert especially when I ask about it. I expect a check at some point. I honestly think this bartender just didn't know better. She was friendly enough but more qualified to be a beer tub girl. Someone should train the servers at this joint it's pretty cool with an interesting menu."}
{"text":"Best bar food in Tempe, hands down.  The Cubano with sweet potato fries is perfect.  Mac and cheese, salads, burgers, all great!  I only post if a place is absolutely amazing or absolutely horrible.  This is a great overall sportsbar."}
{"text":"Have to love $13 chicken n waffles made with, not kidding here, EGGO WAFFLES. Moped right out of there with out eating. Server claimed everyone complains about them"}
{"text":"Great place. Whether you're trying to drink, eat or hangout this place is for everyone! Confused on the people knocking this place. Maybe the hipster place across the street is more your vibe. Definitely  will be coming back to The Lodge!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes about this place because I love the decor and log cabin feel. I have been there once before on the patio and had an iffy experience, but the food seemed ok, so thought I would try it again.  My sister and I went for dinner last Saturday night about 830, stood at the door for about 5 minutes, no one at the host stand. We then asked the bartender if we could just seat ourselves. She was pretty rude and said no, go back to the hostess stand and she'll seat you. We went back and stood for another 3 minutes before a waitress came and asked us if we had been helped, she seated us - I'm not sure a host/ess exists, I never saw one. We sat in a booth across from the bar, our waitress took our drink order, brought the beverages and took our food order. After she left the table we realized the drink order she brought was wrong. We tried to get her attention, in fact several servers/staff walked by us and we couldn't get anyone's attention. Finally a busser/food runner brought our food, we asked him if he could get our waitress, she was standing at the register 8 ft away with her back to us for at least 10 minutes. He went and told her, she blew him off. After 6 more minutes, I went up to her and let her know we had a wrong drink order and needed some service as soon as she had a chance. She just said ok and continued doing whatever she was doing for a solid 15 minutes. A couple minutes later the food runner guy came by again and apologized for the neglectful waitress and helped us get correct drinks and some condiments. Finally after we had everything we needed, at least 20 minutes later, our waitress came by to see what we needed...ha, really? 

Food: My sister ordered wings, which were delicious. I ordered a French dip, which was awful...not fresh, barely warm, the beef was tough and chewy and the fries were not crispy or warm. Very disappointing. The other adult customers seated in the booth next to us, with a different waitress were ignored as well. Staff seemed really young, unprofessional and uninterested in \"service\"...except the awesome food runner dude who took care of us. We made sure to go find him on the patio, tip and thank him before leaving. He said he works behind the bar on Tuesdays and to come back then and he'll be sure to take care of us. I can't imagine I will ever go back...bummer, I like giving good reviews and supporting local Tempe businesses."}
{"text":"Every time we are in Phoenix, usually for spring training, we stop at the Lodge. 2 years in a row we we're blessed with Anna helping us and wow, best waitress ever. Seriously, above and beyond service and awesome personality. Well done!!"}
{"text":"Really fun place to hang out - Sasquatch Pool was great!"}
{"text":"The old town Scottsdale location Lodge was basically my second home,and was so crushed when it got taken over by high rises!  But the new Lodge just off Mill in Tempe is great! I love how huge it is with indoor and outdoor games and a great patio and plenty of bar and table seating. The staff has also always been friendly the multiple times I've been in there too!  All and all I have nothing bad to say about the Lodge Sasquatch Kitchen."}
{"text":"The food is great! I love the shrimp tacos, always good service here, the bartender Kenny was so hospitable and friendly.  I'll be back !!"}
{"text":"Tried this charm of Tempe off impulse for lunch. It is definitely worth a second try during dinner hours. I'm interested to see if it's family friendly during that time. Overall food was filling and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The new Lodge is a definite upgrade over the old one which was located in Old Town. It has the same vibe for the most part, but the outdoor seating is so much more improved. 

The cheese curds... can't beat them! The LSK burger is pretty good as well. Drink prices are decent as well. 

It's one of the better places to grab some food and drinks in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is built upon the bones of an old dive bar, the Sail Inn, that started up in the mid-1990s and lasted for about 20 years. The current owners of this establishment have built a great place upon the existing structure and according to one of the owners (who also owns or is part-owner of the Over Easy chain of breakfast places) live music will definitely be coming back to this location.

The establishment now looks like something you might expect to see up in the wilds of Flagstaff with its wood overlay and bars build to look like they are compiled from sawed off wood logs, and numerous stuffed animals in the main indoor room. 

As for the food and drink, the description I received was fairly spot on, upscale bar food and it has a nice selection of craft brews on tap and in the bottle and in the can, along with the mass produced lagers from the  beer equivalent of the land of Mordor, InBev - in other words, something for everyone. I get the feeling that the early hours of this place may be an older crowd and as the night wears on there will be shift change to a younger college crowd, especially when ASu is in session. In addition, once the weather cools down it will have some great outside seating. 

Oh, for food, I tried the coney island hot dog and onion rings the night it was opened (though I was about two sheets to the wind that first time having attended a cocktail social gathering over at the Culinary Dropout Showcase room across the way. In addition, I went back last night and tried the fried chicken in mushroom gravy (excellent gravy, heavy on the black pepper) and my work associate and I shared an order of the nachos (decent). The beer I had came in a chilled beer glass - sometimes disliked by hard core craft beer enthusiasts but I like a chilled beer glass when it is over a 100 outside.

The only letdown was desert and they warned us they were working on it - we both had an order of the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream - great ice cream but the cookie was bold and cut up and placed standing in a cross section in the ice cream - might I suggest you steal the version of this from Oregano's and do hot, half baked cookie dough with ice cream on top as a better version of this dish?  Boulder's on Broadway also does a similar dish but a cold cookie just doesn't work for me - at least warm it up! 

Other than that, great location and I think this place is off to a great start - can't wait till they bring the music back though I have a feeling it will only be outside as the indoor stage that was once in the Sail Inn (may the concept rest in peace) is no longer there."}
{"text":"Watched the Vikings vs Packer game. 
Great food and friendly staff. The drink selection was good. The prices were also good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was good as was the service. I got the churro French toast and my husband got the Sasquatch burger. He could only eat half of it. But I'd recommend getting some type of sauce on the burger it seemed a bit."}
{"text":"Miss the old lodge!!!  Should have known it would be a rough day when they ran out of the bloody Mary skewers before 1 pm.   We ordered food, waited 45 minutes and finally found our waitress who informed us the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 20 minutes.    Canceled our order and went across the street to the Yard.    It's Sunday during spring training- be prepared.   You may have been \"slammed\" early but not an excuse for terrible experience later in the day.   I'll have to find somewhere else to get my nacho fix."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and always have poor service. It takes a while for the food to come out, even though the food is always good. The servers don't write down my order and sometimes it's wrong. The atmosphere is awesome- open seating at night and there are a lot of seats. The TVs always have sports. It's not crowded on Saturday nights and I always find a seat. It's a lot of fun with good company and no rush, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for good service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.  I sat at the bar outside (along with 7 other patrons) and ordered a glass of wine and water assuring the bartender I would be ordering food soon.  I finished my water and wine and they both sat empty for more than 15 minutes without acknowledgement."}
{"text":"Cute looking place but very LOUD. Food was fine but nothing special. Did I mention it was LOUD. I think it was friendly service - not sure because we could barely hear the server above the \"music.\" We should have gotten back in the car when we had to shout to talk while still in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Myself and a few friends went to the lodge on a busy Saturday night (October 10th) and had a horrible experience. It looks amazing inside and they have done a great job. HOWEVER, my girlfriend and I went to use the restroom and used the same larger stall, as we always do. We both quickly went pee, in and out, no big deal. We weren't taking our time, or doing anything out of the ordinary. My friend is finishing up usibg the toilet and all of a sudden we heard someone banging on our door so hard telling us to \"hurry the f*ck up and get out\". We leave the stall, and see it's an employee of the lodge and she starts screaming and cursing and throwing her fingers in my friends face. She in fact told us that she was going to get us kicked out, and the security guard attempted to escort us out when I stopped at the bar to tell someone about the incident. The girl at the bar was very nice and said she would handle it. I have never in my life had this type of experience at a resteraunt. My friend and i have both been in the resteraubt industry for over 10 years, and that was insane. She needs counseling and anger management! We went and had a few drinks and dinner, and this is how we were treated by an employee. We did nothing wrong! I hope this little girl gets fired and taught a lesson. This is not how you act at your place of enploynent. If you want to be a gangster and fight chicks, do it outside of work honey!"}
{"text":"Delicious American foods. Very American for the southwest but I'm not complaining... great traditional bar grub. Had the 'philly' and wasn't disappointed at all. Came with legit shoestring fries too! Decent brew selection ta boot."}
{"text":"What in the heck did I order here?! In an effort to be healthy I opted for a \"pita stack\" with cucumber, tomato, pita on a bed of hummus. The waitress said, \"oh that's what I had for breakfast!\" So I thought I was golden. 

She must be a lumberjack in disguise because this thing was MASSIVE. I was with a party of 4 other guys and they were staring at me. That part was funny. The healthiest parts of the meal, however were smothered in Mayo. It was basically a veggie/quinoa version of a potato salad between pitas. Whomp whomp. 

Not so healthy. However, super tasty few bites. Needless to say - hungry the rest of the day. :/"}
{"text":"Great, clean , friendly place.  Servers and bartenders very nice, helpful on what to get, and food is excellent, rich, hearty....and good size portions."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went here just winging it before we went to see Macklemore.  It was a pleasant surprise to say the least.  There are tvs for games, a pool table, full bar and the ambiance brought us back to the things we would see growing up in Michigan.  Dead animals on the walls.  The food was actually very good as well.  We will stop by again next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Great food. Great drinks. Great service. Right when you walk in, everybody greets you and makes you feel welcome. I have yet to find anything I don't like on the food menu. Highly recommend the habanero burger! The \"Effen cucumber mules are awesome too."}
{"text":"Upon entering, we were caught up with the aroma of the wood and seeing eerie animals on the walls. Excited to try out a new restaurant with friends.
They do have a decent size menu with a variety of food choices.
I really wanted a Bison burger and it wasn't available. For being a lodge, I assumed they would have game meat..no. So I chose the Bison Meatloaf..and even then it wasn't 100% Bison. It was part Bison and part beef. Really? The meatloaf was soft and mushy and tasteless. I couldn't finish it. Disappointing for $16. 
The vegetables on my plate were dull and lacking color. Nothing Gordon Ramsay would serve . The gravy was a dull brown and tasteless. None of the flavors, within this dish, popped. Clearly this is bar food and caters to the les discerning college crowd."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place within walking distance of our apartment.  I am obsessed with the caesar salad with salmon and crave it weekly. We usually go on weekdays and it is never super crowded. There is a small bar and not a lot of seating inside, but we always manage to get a booth. My husband has tried a burger and bbq sandwich which he said were average. The sweet potato fries come with this awesome marshmallow cinnamon dipping sauce! Really yummy. We also had pretzels and cheese one time and they were huge. This is one of my favorite discoveries in Tempe."}
{"text":"I love this place. What a great atmosphere to watch the game- a beautiful outdoor covered bar and patio, spacious and light inside. The food is great, and the service amazing~ friendly and smiley. A big shout out to the GM Justin for taking such good care of me!! Thank you Lodge, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Super cool staff & the hostess, Julie, is great! I had their habanero burger with waffle fries and it was GOOD! The Mac and cheese with brats was also good! Overall loved this place and the super cool atmosphere, there are sasquatches to take pictures with & lots of games inside and outside. Would love to come here at night and experience the outdoor patio area! 

I definitely recommend checking out this hot & new eatery/bar in Tempe's Farmer Arts District :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great service, great food, great prices and awesome drinks. I highly suggest the gigantic mule."}
{"text":"I have been to The Lodge a few times previously with at least satisfactory service, however this Monday night was different. We arrived when the bar was slow and had about 2-3 customers in it. I ordered a beer for my girlfriend and myself, and unfortunately decided to leave my tab open. After about an hour we had finished our beers and decided to close out. The bar was now busy, but the bartenders thankfully gave me quick attention and closed out my card. When I received the book with my check, my card was unfortunately not in it. I pointed this out to the bartender who closed my tab, who then quickly mobilized the other bartenders to look for my card. Good on her. But then it got bad. They searched for my card for a minute and then upon realizing it was lost they thought the best course of action was to ignore me and help other customers at the now busy bar. I don't expect them to halt all service to search every crevice for a lost credit card, but please at least be honest and keep me informed. I waited for a 5-10 minutes while they moved on to grab orders for other patrons and I eventually had to grab the attention of some one on the other side of the bar who then verified the card was missing by shrugging and saying \"nope man, we can't find it\" and quickly moved on to fulfilling another order. As some one who has worked in the service industry for years, I understand that these things happen. However when I was on the side of the party responsible for the error I have been very apologetic to the slighted customer and offered any help possible to correct the error and compensate for their loss. The employees of The Lodge did not give a shit. The $12 charged to the card for the beers I bought was minor, but to have the beers comped would have been nice. A \"we're very sorry and we hope you still come back\" from a manager would have been fine, and I probably would if I received that. Rather than addressing the issue they ignored it and hoped it would go away. I will now spend two bitter hours resetting every account I have this card tied to, but not until my new card arrives. My time is valuable to me and the short time I allotted to spend out with my friends is now going to cost me hours of frustration that would be made much easier by a small amount of decency and owning up to their error. I will not be returning to The Lodge, and I will strongly recommend to others that they do the same."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with two friends. Sat at the bar and had great local beer while watching the game. Friendly and attentive staff. Great BIG food with SMALL prices. Will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"You want to pay $5.00 for a coors light \"tap\". ON A SUNDAY? Then go here.  I will never be back. Has nothing. Better yet this must be why it is empty and the \"yard\" which is across the street is full again."}
{"text":"We went as a group with 3 parents and 3 teenage boys. All 3 boys got the burgers which were very good! Thick patty of meat with a good bun and good fries! Adults had wings, pork, and salads. All were very good and we'd recommend. We had a nice waitress who gave us lots of attention. 
Boys had fun playing pool. 
Great place for a lunch - we'd recommend."}
{"text":"First of all, you should probably drug test your employees. This place employs extremely seedy people. The scrawny bar back will pick pocket you when the rest of the staff isn't paying you any mind of service. The place also smells like complete shit. DO NOT waste your time."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good place to go after work and I found it! Great selection of beer and alcohol and the staff has been wonderful and friendly. There is a great atmosphere here and just a fun place to be."}
{"text":"Nice chill spot to have a brew or two and watch games with your friends. Huge patio! My favorite item on the menu is the cubano! Best Cuban sandwich I have tried out here so far. I would also recommend trying the wings of you are looking to get a bang for your buck. This place has definitely become a place my friends and I always consider when we are just trying to find a place to hang out."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. Nothing spectacular, but a good place to watch the game or meet friends."}
{"text":"This was the second time having lunch here with coworkers and I was looking forward to try it again. This time I was really disappointed in what I ordered.  I initially ordered the fish sandwich with waffle fries but changed it to the fish n chips. This came as a recommendation from the server. They were more like fish nuggets with heavy batter and shoestring fries.  I didn't expect the fries since I asked for waffle fries initially. When I asked to change it I was told that's how the order came.  So I asked for a side of them instead but was charged for it.  A little overpriced for fish nuggets and side of waffle fries. At least the tortilla soup was decent. Forgot to mention the homeless guy who kept hovering around the bar was a little disappointing when he was asked to leave but kept making his way back."}
{"text":"Greatest food in Tempe. Hands down. The service is awesome, atmosphere is great for games - you don't get the college young drunk kids and the quality of the experience is worth it. One of my favorite places in the city. Try the chicken strips. The mac and cheese. The burgers. The salads. It's all VERY good."}
{"text":"First ordered the bacon wrapped jalape√±os and one was still frozen when I took a bite. The waitress said she would not charge us for it but they still did. After I paid I told her and she just laughed, very professional.  She was in a rush to close me out to drink behind the bar with her friends and assured me if I closed out someone would help me. \"Don't worry, we have 5 other people waiting tables, you will be fine.\"  Waited 37 minutes and not one person asked if I was ok or needed anything. Never got dinner, but hey the beer was cold!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times since they have opened and my experience has always been great! Shannon has waited on me many times and her service is always spot on she remembers me and always greets me with a warm and friendly welcome. The lodge beer is a great beer and value I recommend the lodge to everyone. I also brought my dog last week and they treated him so well the server brought him a bowl of water this really is a great neighborhood bar"}
{"text":"The worst. First there's a sever line on the patio which stinks and there are flies and fruit flies galore.
I had the steak which was supposed to be medium rare but wasn't even close. Waitresses were hard to get a hold of despite the place being almost empty.
As the name suggests, a lodge doesn't belong in Phoenix.
With a great place like the culinary dropout across the street, save your aggravation and go there."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff and good food. Service was a little slow but we were a big party. Venison steak chili was excellent- a little on the spicy side but I like that. My friends enjoyed the chicken burger and said the taco salad was outstanding. The tortilla soup was good but not great. We liked the shoestring fries better than the sweet potato fries. Big pretzels were excellent. There is a good selection of beers on tap -- the stout was tasty, ditto the \"Church Music\" IPA. We were treated to a round of bourbon mules, their new cocktail. Very good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant really looks like a lodge on the inside. There is plenty of seating plus a full bar both inside and out along with a few games, pool table.
Food is great! Be sure to get the sweet potato fries with campfire sauce 
Service was okay, we weren't even sitting at the bar and the bar tender was a lot more attentive then the waitress."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good. Follow them on Instagram to see droll worthy pictures of their food. Everything we've ever tried has been great but I recommend the Mac n cheese with green chili or adding the agreen chili to the nachos. 

Weekends have $10 bottomless mimosas with a meal and no one can say that's a bad deal."}
{"text":"I loved this bar when it was in Scottsdale and now that it moved to Tempe, I'm even more stoked! I'm a skier and I love the vibe of this bar, it feels like you just stopped in for a cold beer and hearty sandwich after hours of hitting the slopes. 

Kudos to bartender Justin, he was attentive, funny, but had a very chill personality. He was doing his thing working behind the bar, but would check on us and chime in on a play in the football game to make us feel acknowledged. The food is amazing and the patio is huge with lots of space to play fun, outdoor drinking games. Order the fried pickles or pretzel with beer cheese and wash it down with a $3 Lodge Lager - Mmmmm!

I wish this place was here years ago when I lived in the neighborhood, because I felt the previous bar that was in this spot was not very welcoming. The Lodge is way more my style!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the service is not okay. I love the vibe of the restaurant and the options they have to choose from, but their service is terrible. I tried ordering a beer from the bar and I was told to go back to my table to order and I haven't seen a server in 20 minutes. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Would have been a five but service was below par :( It was a busy night with the game on so definitely don't blame our server but they should have had more servers in the bar area. Otherwise food was awesome! We all split the nachos, cheese curds and pretzels. All really good! For dinner I ordered the pretzel burger which was awesome (because after the pretzels for appetizers I needed more, obviously). My friend got the sweet potato fries...and wait for it...it came with FROSTING DIPPING SAUCE. Mind. Blown. Out of this world. That was my take away-  burgers are good, sweet potato fries, to die for! Overall cool atmosphere and drinks (I ordered Pinot noir) were on point!"}
{"text":"The burger was ridiculously good!  

stumbled upon this place while looking for some other place across the street, but the lodge looked so much more inviting...as much as an 8ft Sasquatch can. I'm so glad we decided to check it out!  

We were only in town for a couple days, but had to go back a 2nd time and have the burger AGAIN! 

You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite \"neighborhood\" bar and restaurant in Tempe.  It has some solid happy hour specials that includes food and drink.

The food is great, I have yet to have a bad meal here.  Not to mention the staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"Moved in a couple months ago right around the corner from this place and I decided to stop in and try it. 
Walked in last Thursday around 530, we were greeted at the front and sat ourselves in the patio. 
The place seemed bare for a happy hour crowd with only three groups there. And I can see why. 
Waitress and the bartender walked past us a few times without any acknowledgement. After 20 minutes of waiting without receiving any service we walked out. 
Will not be back."}
{"text":"Super awesome that it's close to me but I feel the staff is always friendly and quick. It's usually not very busy which is nice to me even though the staff probably wishes it were busier. The food is basic bar food but it's pretty inexpensive so that's a plus. And they have cheap tacos for taco Tuesday!! I recommend this bar for anyone looking for a chill place to grab a pint and play darts or pool."}
{"text":"We went on Monday night for take out and a drink at the bar while we waited. Excellent customer service,  friendly hostess,great ambience. Let down was the food. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles that had a fancier name. It looks like Eggos waffles with a regular fried frozen chicken patty. Please change the food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food, cool bar. Cozy inside and nice outdoor bar too. The inside looks like a lodge. Plenty of big screen TVs for football Sunday's."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow but the food is great and the atmosphere is fun and friendly. It's a great place to go after work but get there early or there is no where to park."}
{"text":"Would leave less if I could.  The security here really freaks girls out any time we go, mostly the door guy and some guy named beast. Who introduces themselves like that?? 

Great location, awful staff."}
{"text":"The vibe and atmosphere here is really cool. The outdoor patio is clutch. They have sports on all the TVs and a great selection of beer. Our service was phenomenal. I ordered the horder chicken sandwich. It was really good. The waitress offered us a bowl of beer cheese because she said we had to try it. It was SO good! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Came here twice with work, both times tried the Sasquatch.  Fantastic burger although it is a lot of food so beware.  How to best handle the beast, I take the grilled cheese buns and tackle them separately and open each up and cut the burger in two and place inside.  Thank you MvF for the strategies.  I think they should make a girlled cheese with a burger inside as I could tackle that as a normal lunch.  The sasquatch is fun and each time I've gone the staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner & it was really yummy. The portions are very generous.....super large. They have happy hour from 3-6pm Monday-Friday. Our waitress was very friendly & made sure we had plenty of utensils, drinks never ran low & asked if we needed anything else. 
I ordered the Sun Devil Chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun & it was so good. The pretzel bun was very soft & the chicken was so savory & flavorful. My fiance ordered the shrimp tacos & he loved them! They were good! He said it was like shrimp off the barbie.....so good. 
We also had a cup of the sirloin chili & the green chili pork. Once again, both very savory....I did not need to add my hot sauce to anything. Thats a plus!
Its a great spot to eat, hangout & grab a cold beer!"}
