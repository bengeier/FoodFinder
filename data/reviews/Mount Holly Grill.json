{"text":"The food was better then expected. It is worth the trip. Waitstaff are very friendly and the price is right for what you are getting. From the looks out sode it seems like a hole in the wall but it is a good old fassion mom and pop shop. My coworkers and i went there for lunch. Got the philly cheese steaks, with frys and drinks. The frys looked amazing but where alittle soggy. As if they were made for the lunch rush and sat out some. But still good. The sandwich was very suprising. Definilty going back again."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here for quite a while. The food is inconsistent and less than par; however, the waitresses are worth the visit. Tonight I witnessed the owner, Mildon, yell at a waitress in front of me while taking my order and proceed to slam the door. I asked to speak with him after my meal to express his unprofessional conduct. I also was yelled at and told to get out. I will never go back, after all I can buy a salt Lick neck door at Mt Holly farm supply. Unprofessional, bad food and horrible atmosphere and sanitation grade. What type of businessman conducts business this way?....A very poor one."}
{"text":"It's quickly becoming my favorite place to grab breakfast.  Love the French Toast with crispy bacon and for lunch or dinner, the Philly Cheesesteak is delish (with jalape√±os if you're looking to spice things up).  The staff are always attentive and friendly.  Nice job guys!"}
{"text":"So I am still fairly new to finding this place, even though i have lived here my whole life. It is a GREAT place to eat. My only negative comment is the wait. We got seated quickly and got our order taken quickly but then had to wait over 45 min for our food. It actually would have been longer but we ended up leaving before our food came because we did not want to wait any more. HOWEVER we still go here quite often, mostly do take-out now. Their Gyro's are AWESOME! I also love that i have found another place that has livermush!! Their food here is always good, i haven't had any bad food. All home cooked and fresh. SO GOOD!! just be weary if deciding to dine in that you may have to wait."}
{"text":"I started eating here 2 years ago. I work in Mt. Holly. There used to be a lady who worked here, and she was sooooo nice. I would call in and she would already know what I wanted to eat. This is not a fancy restaurant. It is a good hole in the wall type of place. Usually you can seat yourself even though they have a sign that says wait to be seated. The fried chicken wrap is amazing. It isn't on the menu, but you can order it anyway. The beef tips and chicken tips are great. The best sides are mashed potatoes and gravy, okra, rice and gravy and corn. I have never had their breakfast,  I have heard it's good as well. They are super fast with making the food. Sometimes I will call there on my lunch break, and they will have my food ready when I sit down at a table."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best, trying to do to much and not doing any of it well. But the real downfall of this place is the building. It looks like an old warehouse they threw some tables in and called a restaurant. If you don't mind the school cafeteria food and feel of the place then it's not a bad value. You get a decent amount of food if you can keep it down."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  We used to eat there when it was Blacks Blue Water.  Having been a prior restaraunt owner i was glad to find a welcoming staff, good food, and large portions.  The environment could use some sprucing but the food and service more than made up for that."}
{"text":"Nice place, bigger than it looks from the outside with a lot of indooor seating and a super friendly staff that really took care of us. The burger was way better than the one I had from JPeters a few weeks ago with more flavor and over half the cost too. My son ate all of his chicken tenders and liked the flavor - they weren't heavily breaded either which is a great thing. I almost wanted some tenders for myself. Bananna pudding was really good too as was the sweet tea.   We will be back here for sure to try breakfast and other lunch and dinner items.   Also happy this place is open on Sundays until 3 since many other places in the area are closed."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good breakfast this morning and happen to come across this place. Parking lot was packed and that's always a plus. We were greeted right away and seated quickly and they made sure we were taken care of! Daily special was liver mush, 2 eggs, grits or hash browns and biscuits for 4.50. That's a good price for the amount of food. It was really good and the liver mush was nice and crispy. Also ordered the western omelette which was very fresh and the veggies were not over cooked! I always check out biscuits and they were homemade, light and fluffy. Pancakes are huge and were not tough at all. The gravy tasted like it was made from powder mix! That is something that is easy to make and not sure why they don't. Overall it was a great breakfast. The atmosphere needs a little help, there are no windows in dinning room and it's very dated! I will return again and try dinner!!"}
{"text":"I was apprehensive by the curb appeal.. Glad I went in. The food is very good and prices are very reasonable. I have been back many times! Great breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Irene from Caravan Coffee & Dessert Bar of Mt. Holly told us of the \"great food (specifically breakfast fare) served here at two-months' old Mount Holly Grill, which used to house Black's Bluewater Seafood and Grill.  I was apprehensive of the quality of food I was going to find, since this definitely looked like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, and the indoor layout and furnishings didn't do much to smash my apprehension of dining here.  However, my inquiry into what went into the Alfredo sauce (heavy cream, not cornstarch) used in one of today's specials, Fettucine Alfredo with either chicken or shrimp, made me feel less anxious.  This entree came with a house salad, but I asked if fries could be substituted, instead (yes).  It also came with tea, which I gave to my sis.  She ordered a chicken salad sandwich, with fries.  I also ordered a cup of coffee- great aroma and flavor, but made my stomach hurt- I suspect it might be of the bagged variety.  The chicken fettuccine Alfredo was delicious!  It came with broccoli and cauliflower florets and carrot slices. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mount-holly-grill-mount-holly?select=gt-sDCaJKcDTu57GeKRcZw#gt-sDCaJKcDTu57GeKRcZw  I was going to ask for a shaker of grated parmesan to thicken the sauce a bit and add a little bit more cheese flavor, but decided to have a taste, and I found I didn't need to ask for anything more- the salt content was just right.  Sister also loved this dish.  The pasta, which was prepared just a tad over al dente (read: a little too tender), was also accompanied with a buttered piece of Texas toast, which I enjoyed.  I was told that the fries would take a little while longer, and they indeed arrived much later, when I was about two forkfuls away from finished (lots of leftovers).  They were of the crinkled-cut frozen variety, but crisped and salted perfectly.  While the Alfredo sauce was thinner than I would like, its flavor and mouth-feel were satisfying-enough-- so content to find a diner/dive that didn't use cornstarch slurry as a thickener!  (I wonder if their biscuits and gravy will be a safe bet for me should we ever return?  I most likely won't, as this was my first visit back to Mt. Holly in 25 years!)  My sister really enjoyed her chicken salad sandwich and fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mount-holly-grill-mount-holly?select=IHIVhQFaOERhT5qE_BhePQ#IHIVhQFaOERhT5qE_BhePQ  Generous portion of chunky chicken salad (sis remarked that it was not overladen with mayonnaise), lettuce, and a thick slice of tomato sandwiched between lightly-toasted white bread. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mount-holly-grill-mount-holly?select=qOlyg6dZcOtDJD97dAu01A#qOlyg6dZcOtDJD97dAu01A  Friendly and efficient service, and it seemed like the wait staff knew most of the customers there.  I was surprised to find that the women's restroom had cranberry-painted walls, cranberry candle sconces, a photo frame (albeit falling apart), and even a side table to place a handbag on.  I'd say the restroom had better ambience than the dining hall.  I met one of the owners (or perhaps there's only one owner), Milton Suarez, who rang us up at the end of the meal- you bring your receipt to the podium, of sorts, before exiting the establishment.  We told him that we'd met a coffee shop clerk who told us about MHG, and so I'd asked if it had just opened up.  He said, \"Yes.  A couple of weeks, well, one, or two months.\"  Funny answer, that, but he's a nice-enough guy...  Should we return to Mt. Holly again, we most likely won't return here, as I'll be looking to another restaurant to Yelp about, but I'd like to wish good luck to the new owner/s of Mt. Holly!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Reuben which was one of the daily specials. Instead of sauerkraut, it had cooked cabbage on it. This place is really run down. It looks like a hole in the wall & tasted like it too. Their only saving grace was the friendly employees & they make frozen french fries pretty good. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place looking for a spot to have breakfast one morning. Wasn't really sure what to expect, but for a small country diner-ish spot is was great!  The service was fast and friendly and the food was pretty good. If you're looking for a fancy breakfast spot I wouldn't recommend this place. But for good reasonably priced food and great service, I would definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT when it first opened, but has gone down hill FAST! We have dined here several times, each time a little worse off than before. This week was our last trip, I ordered a fish sandwich (I got fish, with no bun or tartar sauce), and my husband ordered french fries with his Bacon cheeseburger and got banana pudding instead of the fries. The waitress was in \"lala land\" and could not understand why we were not happy with the \"sandwich with no bun\" and banana pudding where fries should have been ??? She was totally confused and the opwner acted like he was made because we wanted a bun and fries with our sandwich combos...Is that really too much to ask...for our orders to be right, or at least close to being correct???? LAST TIME FOR US."}
{"text":"Very much a hole-in-the-wall place but not bad food. Just nothing crazy to write home about. The dessert was the best part. We went at an off-time, so I would go back when they are busier to see if that helps the quality of the food at all."}
{"text":"Cute little hole in the wall. Looks small from the outside but once your inside, there are lots of tables and booths. Service was very good, our waitress was friendly and attentive.  Food is good down home cooking. No frills, just good food."}
{"text":"Terrible!  Terrible!  Terrible!   I don't even know where to start...the waitress was rude (didn't catch her name because she never gave it).  I ordered eggs, hash browns with onions and cheese and corned beef hash and the husband ordered the All American. The waitress comes back, sits my plate down and says, \"they forgot your onions and cheese\" and walks away. She never asked if I'd like it corrected or even apologized!  Husband's food comes out 2 or 3 minutes later and he never got his pancakes with his breakfast. The waitress never came back to ask if we needed anything. The manager, however, was nice enough to take the husband's meal off the bill considering he didn't get half of it.     We definitely will not be back."}
