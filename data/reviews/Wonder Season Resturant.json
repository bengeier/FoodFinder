{"text":"This place is closed. I'm standing where it should be...  Ok Yelp, you want more words. It won't change the fact that a very brief sentence sums up my non-experience because the place wasn't there.  I hope this is long enough to ease your highness."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place ever since it opened. All i can say is that it's a lovely place, huge interior and a nice atmosphere.  Food:   I love their dim sum! Their Crispy Beef Cantonese Chow Mien is so good (moderate amount of sauce and nice crispy noodles hmmm nummy)  Service:  Ok, even though they're pretty slow at times, I do wanna address that they don't have a lot of staff aboard and cooking time-consuming dishes does take a while. But aside from that, the owners (which are the staff) are very nice and accommodating people.   Price/Menu:  Lots of great, delicious Chinese dishes! The prices are decent in terms of comparing to others out there. It varies sometimes, but I do say the dim sum is quite cheap (for me i guess) :D  Overall:   I'd still be going there anyway! The only Chinese restaurant I know that serves delicious goodness that's just a walk away from my house XD   P.S. don't miss out on their Dim Sum!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, It's one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Scarborough area.  Nothing too fancy, just good authentic Chinese food.  Recommended:  Crispy beef with ginger & Hot and Sour soup."}
