{"text":"This grocery store has everything you would want from a family run Italian store. I would've scored it higher had the cashier been even remotely friendly. The prices are pretty good, selection is outstanding, all they need to work on is customer service and it will be a go to spot."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing but the ordering process by phone is painful. Everytime I call I'm transferred to the wrong department at least once if not twice. Pretty frustrating.....but I keep going back because of the taste. 
It would be helpful if there were a direct number to the cafe."}
{"text":"I think this will be my new favorite Italian market of Calgary!... It has a very good variety of products, different kind of cheeses and sausages that are not easy to find in other places, the Italians products are all amazing... And if you want to eat there is a great place to have lunch on a weekend!!.. The food is really good, the pizzas are great, and the ice cream is just Awesome!,.. In addition the service very very friendly!.. I absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when it first opened... then slowly but surely they started to increase their prices (a couple items I used to get regularly are 30-40% more now!). The fresh made pizzas in the cafe used to be amazing & loaded with toppings- now there just okay and often include less meat. Anyways, it's still a great grocery store but not like when it first opened. I also wish they had options for nitrate free meats. And the parking during lunch and dinner is bananas!"}
{"text":"Selection and quality: 5 stars
Value: 2.5 stars

As good a selection as you would find at a fine Italian market in Montreal or Toronto - at double or more the prices. Elsewhere in the country one goes to neighborhood ethnic markets for bargains, but in Calgary we seem to be happy to pay a significant premium for the privilege.

One additional caveat: Parking is a nightmare."}
