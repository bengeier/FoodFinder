{"text":"Just another large suburban movie theatre. Blockbuster films, overpriced snacks foods (but a good selection), and plenty of parking. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Scene.ca has obnoxious advertising that cannot be deleted from your screen. To even send them a comment you need to have your Scene number, which I discarded long ago! Adchoices will not get rid of them either!"}
{"text":"souvent remplir d'adolescent car il y a des arcades ''on the side'', souvent été prise dans des salles avec des adolescents qui parlaient non-stop(facilement atteignable grâce aux autobus et la proximité du carrefour Laval/ métro montmorency). La majorité des films sont en anglais depuis deux ans environs, difficile de trouvé une traduction pour les gens qui ne sont pas fluent en anglais. vraiment dommage.  pis c'est même pas vrai, le pop corn est pas SI bon que ça."}
{"text":"Vaste Ciné complexe qui offre tous les derniers Blockbuster en Francais et en Anglais ! J'y suis aller maintenant 2 fois en solitaire et j'ai beaucoup aimé l'endroit. Il offre un bon choix de tous les derniers films à gros budgets réguliers, en 3D, AVX ou Dbox ( lorsque le siège bouge je crois bien). Le prix me semble assez raisonnable par rapport à d'autres cinema, 11.50 adulte la plupart des soirs. A part sa, on y retrouve les éléments standard d'un cinéma régulier : Pop Corn, friandises et boissons, hotdogs, jeux d'arcade et machine à billet ( pour ne pas faire la file d'attente). Un autre petit plus est un stand de pop corn à saveurs diverses: pop corn au caramel, au cheddar et jalapeno et autre ! Enfin , le complexe cinéma est entouré d'un vaste parking et est inclus dans Centropolis, un concept de resto,  magasins et condos à Laval, comme une mini ville. Tout ceci se trouve convenablement à 10 min du métro montmorency!"}
{"text":"I mean... it's a theatre... To me, the best place in Laval and the seats are much more comfortable than others... Popcorn is amazing (I'll be honest, I go to the theatre with my son just to eat popcorn :-)  But it's just a theatre...  Oh right, they have video games... And a special room for super sound and moving chairs, etc...   They usually have a good mix of French & English titles..."}
{"text":"My favourite cinema! Clean, amazing picture & sound, plenty of FREE parking and best of all it's in Centropolis with many cool restaurants! Only thing missing? A real IMAX screen!"}
{"text":"Il fallait bien que j'aille un jour essayer le cinéma en forme de soucoupe volante!  C'est un Cineplex qui présente des versions originales anglaises et à quelques minutes de voiture de chez notre copine qui gardait notre bébé. Il a tout pour se faire aimer! ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty similar to any large movie theatre. Nothing stands out except for it's spaceship architecture. Sure it may have been a good idea when it was built, but time defines it now as akward."}
{"text":"Plus cher que Guzzo, mais j'adore. Le popcorn est bon, grands choix de films, cinéma maman-bébé, quoi demandé de plus?"}
{"text":"The colossus.  In our first night in Canada we decided to stay away from the city and we to this movie theater, it's a huge theater with very comfortable leather seats that  recline, good sound and huge screens and also with a really nice system were you actually get to pick your seating as you buy your ticket which makes a lot nicer (we have this only in a few upscale theaters here in Chicagoland hopefully others regular theaters will get this system soon), in general great movie experience, they show all the movies in French and English, so make sure you ask for the version you want to see, very friendly staff always smiling, but some did not spoke English."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the new Monsters Inc University movie with the family.  Theatre is what you expect, gigantic screen and excellent sound.  Movie pricing seems to be quite expensive these days but hey...entertainment sure is a premium!!"}
{"text":"At.first i.didnt know the place but once inside its super nice. You pay by your self.at the machine or online ticket. What cool its they have mini restaurant milkshake and starbuck!  Of course arcade area and avx section movie.  I never went before to see avx movie, the sound its serial and the seat can move so that you can feel more like at home super relax. I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I rarely go to the movies. But this place is cool; big, lots of fast food choices, fast service when picking up your ticket. I have no complaints really... Minus the stained chairs in the theaters and the sticky floor.. Ew."}
{"text":"My favorite Cinema complex in Laval!  Pros :  - Lots of theaters available, film variety in both languages are available.  - Seats are comfortable except for the new AVX theater ones that cannot be locked in and you're constantly falling too far back into the seat behind you (and getting bumped!)  - The ability to book your movies ONLINE without having to wait in the horrible lines anymore! Heck, you can even reserve YOUR SEAT online in select showings!  - Close to many quality restos in the area of the Centropolis.   Cons :  - You can even reserve YOUR SEAT online in select showings... can this please be done for more than 1 movie at a time please? We're 2013 already! Why must I wait 20+ minutes to have decent seats to hot movies?  - Parking is annoying and on top of that little to no consideration is done for pregnant women.  - Incredibly slow lines to buy tickets... why can't we have a line reserved for cash only? Anyways, buy them online instead!"}
{"text":"This theatre is huge and state of the art! I have yet to experience the 3D or 3D AVX theatres there but wil and apparently  7.2 Dolbly Digital where std cinema is 5.2, leather reclining seats so they are slightly more approx. $4.00 -$5.00 more. This Cinema offers a box office of at least ten people at the box office and approx. fifteen plus automated machine that you can self serve and buy tickets!  The big plus as a Scene member I get rewards to free movies and quickly compare to other reward programs. You can join www.scene.ca  I tried to buy the ticket thru my app but experienced problems(gift card would take) and called Cinplex CSR who suggested i buy the ticket online and apologized about the app issue. He walked me through the online purchase to make sure all would be ok and it was!  I called the theatre for a suggested time I should arrive since this was the 1st Spiderman showing she sooooooo helpful! I got great seat due to the advice! Salle 12 was clean, the seats very comfy as well the brought a concession cart with popcorn in at the beggining so you could get good seats and snacks!  Movie: The Amazing Spiderman amazing inded not the typical story as in the Toby McGuire series, no Mary Jane, no J Jona Jameson....at least not this sequel. Yes Uncle Ben(Martin Sheen) & Aunt May(Sally Fields) were present and both characters we played well by 2 vetrans!  I leave you with that and tell you the movie is more realistic! would I go again, not sure but on DVD yep! The Avengers definitely a 2 - 3 timer ;)"}
{"text":"I Always come here when ever I'm in the mood for a movie they have a lot of English movies to chose from unlike guzzo in Laval . So far I don't know a better place to watch movies in English and French . Their arcaded is price so are the snacks but now a days it' like that every where."}
