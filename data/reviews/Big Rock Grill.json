{"text":"This place is great. It was my first time there. We went there for lunch on a weekday, our reservation was for pretty early so there wasn't anyone there when we showed up, but quickly started filling up as lunch went on. 

For starters we ordered the pretzels with cheese fondue. The pretzels were thin and chewy, and I liked the mustard that came with, but I wasn't so keen on the cheese sauce. I don't think it was a mistake on the restaurants part, I think maybe I just don't like fondue in general. We also ordered a sampler of beers/ciders. You get 5 4 ounce beers on a sample tray, and they have an awful lot of stuff on tap. My favourite was the pear cider. 

For mains, I ordered the chicken pot pie with yam fries, and I have to say this pie was one of the best I've ever had. Crispy, flaky pastry and the chicken filling had loads of colourful veggies inside. It was more suited for a winter's day, I think, than a hot summer day, but I love savoury pies in general so I was happy to eat it out of season. The sweet potato fries were legit the best I've ever had. They were very hot and crispy. A lot of places have yam fries that are floppy and not like 'fries' but these fries were awesome. They didn't have the 'vegetabley' taste that some sweet fries can have. 

One nitpicky thing about the main was that they served me the pie in its foil baking tin when I would have preferred it not to be there. I removed it myself before I dug in, but I didn't really have any room on the table to tuck it anywhere. I just don't think it belonged on the plate, but they might have needed to keep it on to prevent the pie from collapsing. As I said, that complaint is me being REALLY nitpicky, as the pie itself was delicious.

I will definitely come back, but it will be tough to try something new as I'm just going to want to order the same thing again."}
{"text":"One of the best place in Calgary for real authentic Austrian and German food! There aren't a lot of places in Calgary where we can find food that reminds us of home (my hubby is from Austria and I would consider it my second home) but THIS IS THE PLACE. We had wiener schnitzel and goulash with sp√§tzle that were both mouth watering and generous portions. Looking forward to come back for the homemade pies. If you prefer something more local, their burgers and fish are great too! I have not seen the same lunch specials the 3 times I've been here and they come with home baked cookies. And if you have any room left from lunch, then try the dessert! OMG they are TO DIE FOR. Just looking at the dessert menu is enough to make me drool again.

Chef Harry is not only great at making the best Austrian food in town, he is also extremely friendly and hospitable. Along with fantastic food at reasonable price, there is also a great selection of local craft beer by Big Rock Beer. These beer are brewed right there so it can't get any fresher and better than this! The only downside is that this place is only open on weekdays for lunch but they are open for corporate or private functions upon request. I can't wait to come back again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Big Rock Grill is that it's on the same site as the Big Rock Brewery. Good, fresh, beer but the food is only good if you're into German cuisine. Which doesn't make sense because Big Rock is a Calgary-based outfit. I'm not aware of any ties to Germany, but there must be some somewhere....
Anyway, we had to call ahead for lunch reservations (which is all they serve, opening at 11:30 and closing at 2 p.m.) because the place is quite popular with lunch crowds from businesses in the area. We were all excited to try it, but it didn't really live up to expectations.
The beer was good and anyone craving German-inspired dishes will like the authenticity of the food. But the service was slow. I don't know if they should take all the blame for me missing my flight out of town, because we had to have another beer to wash the food down and this city is hard to get around in during construction. But, all the same, I think I'll grab Big Rock beer at a place that offers more of a selection of food."}
{"text":"We love their beer so we decided to try the grill. 

They have a very impressive menu and list of specials. The food was great and well presented. 

The building isn't much to write home about but you're not here for the building.  This place rocks where it matters. Service, beer and food!

We will come back!
(Since we live in Texas that is saying something!!)"}
{"text":"I had the tourtiere yesterday. The crust was burnt. And the size of the dish was small. I was expecting something much better. I was disappointed. The waitress was awesome: funny, friendly and frank. Thanks Michelle."}
{"text":"For an industrial park it's pretty damned good food. The menu has a decent variety of dishes although somewhat weighted toward German food. Beer is good and they can accommodate most food sensitivities. My biggest complaint is that the menus hasn't changed in at least 4 years. THE MENU HAS BEEN REVISED AS OF MAY 29, 2013 AND ITS FAR BETTER THAN IT WAS, STILL VERY MUCH A FAN!"}
{"text":"So I've just heard of the beer, which is actually pretty good considering I am kind of picky about beer.  

Now I get to eat at their restaurant.....in the back yard of the actual brewerie.....only open for lunch...?  How pretentious.

Actually not.  Being from out of town, I learned from locals that the beer is actually distributed Canada-wide.  In addition, doing pretty well.

So, the restaurant was an interesting treat and very unpresuming.  

The place is very normal, with a meeting room feel with an attached bar and a few wall items to make it more homey.  

The food was pretty good, but not all German as described in other rviews.  I had the schnitzel which is actually a tenderized pork chop covered in bread crumbs.  This came with a nice salad and roasted potatoes.   Others had the Elk burger, steak sandwich, seafood ragout, amonst others.  All looked good.

{"text":"In conjunction with a tour of Big Rock Brewery, our group was also served by Markus and his wonderful staff at Big Rock Grill.  They have a vast array of choices in their catering menu.  The food and service was all amazing.  Many of the guests talked about coming back for lunch based on how delicious the food was.  I bought a Turducken pie to bake for another night and can't wait for my family to taste it! 

The space is bright and contemporary without being pretentious.  They are open for lunch, but keep them in mind for any events you have planned!  Markus is great to work with and very prompt in all communication."}
{"text":"We frequently stop in for lunch here, as it is a great place to do so heading through Calgary from Edmonton to Southern Alberta. 

Food is very tasty, and German in influence.  Being a brewery, you are also able to taste any of the beers they make.  Big Rock makes some very good beer too.  

The service has always been good.  They are only open on weekdays for lunch, but always worth the trip."}
