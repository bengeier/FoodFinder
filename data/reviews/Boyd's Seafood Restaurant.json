{"text":"My Family has a tradition of getting takeout for Boyd's every Good Friday and I find myself looking forward to it more every year. It's simple Canadian style fish and chips but it's scrumptious. But their menu is more wide-ranging then I'm giving them credit for; you can of course get a wide variety of seafood from lobster, salmon or calamari but I must argue that you can't go wrong with their basic 2 piece meal.  As I mentioned they do takeout so Boyd's is a good choice for a large party or group that's sick of pizza and Chinese."}
{"text":"BleccchhH! (take out)  What to say, We got a couple 'family meals'($40 an order) to take out as we were helping some friends move...   6 pieces of cod covered in soggy tempura which were shaped like long sausages (obviously they steamed in the styro take out container making them soggy)   1 Box of greasy soggy luke warm fries.   6 packets of the nastiest tarter sauce I have ever tasted   1 tub of Coleslaw that is soooo garlicky, you'll think your eating greek.    Now I want to be fair and say that takeout deep fry is not a good idea ever and it might be better if you eat in... Not that I will be trying that anytime soon.   Pros:  3 family meals ready for pick up in 10 minutes... really... 10 mins? Hummm.   Cons:  Coleslaw ( why does it taste like Taziki?)  Soggy Central!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Boyd's is a super tasty seafood restaurant in the vein of red lobster but so. much. better. I don't make the journey down that far for nothing: only crab and fish and chips have this power over me.   This is the deal: -Old school decor -All seafood, all the time - Canadian style, and cheap -The crab and the calamari are delish! -I don't need no buckets o' fish when it is this good  It's not my first choice for a nice night out, but if you're looking for seafood grub and a relaxed family atmosphere, this is the place to find it."}
{"text":"I think this is the fastest I've ever had fish and chips cooked and served to me. A friend and I were headed to watch a 2:10 show at Chinook. We were trying to find a spot downtown to meet for lunch with no avail, so we headed further south.   It was 1:40 by the time we made it to Boyd's. It was 2:20 when we left. Seriously, that fast! We both ordered fish and chips and each serving was cooked through and through (well, deep fried I guess).  Our server was a friendly chap, chit-chatting away with each table, he was a hit with the some of the tables of older couples. He spend a few moments talking to us as well. We heard a bit about his son, some tidbits about the cooks in the back... it was cute.   Our meals were filling. Lotsa fish, lotsa sides... two of us ate for under $35 and we both came out stuffed! Not too bad for a Sunday lunch. I had the mashed potatoes as my side. They were nice and garlic-y, but they coulda been a little creamier.  Not my first choice of spots to go in the area, but if you're driving by and have a hankering for some halibut, it'll do a-ok. It'd lso work well for that weekend family kind of meal. Besides the people with their kids, we were the youngest ones in the joint."}
