{"text":"I was skeptical before trying this place out because of the other reviews here but I thought I would give Sir Greek a try since I was craving souvlaki.  The pork skewer was grilled fresh on the spot (not pre cooked)  and nicely marinated.  Took about 5-10 mins to prepare the order.  Very typical toppings (a few slices of tomato and onion),  but you could tell the tzatziki was homemade.  Fries were also hand cut and very good.  
The owner told me he makes his own gyros so I think I'll try that next time.  
Prices are reasonable, my souvlaki on a pita with fries and a pop was about $11.50
I'll return next time I'm craving Greek fast food."}
{"text":"I was wandering around the area looking for somewhere to eat and wandered in. At first I wasn't sure what I wanted but then the friendly owner suggested pork tenderloin as that's what he was eating too(slow night). Let me tell you, the portion size was nothing short of ridiculous as I couldn't finish my meal my a large margin. And the food was delicious. The decor is a bit drab but if you want a good meal that's fairly priced this is the place. As well they make their own pita which is very unique and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with my boyfriend. The owner deceived us into getting two souvlaki chicken dinners when we weren't that hungry- he told us one wouldn't be enough. He was very nice about the whole thing- even made it seem like he was throwing in salad and stuff for free. When we go to pay the total came up to $45.. without drinks or anything. Just two sticks of chicken souvlaki and some potatoes and rice. This guy needs to stop robbing people, or at least make the food worth the outrageous price."}
{"text":"This place just scammed me by overcharging for a gatorade. I hate business owners who make up prices on the fly. I get even more livid when I see them doing this to poor kids. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad and disgusting.

I honestly cant believe the owner thinks its suitable to serve what he does.  I went into this place on a sunday evening and ordered a souvlaki on a pita.  There is a a grill in the place, stove, etc.  So I was expecting to see him throw some chicken on the grill.  No.  He went into the back popped some disgusting monstrosity into the microwave and stole $9 bucks from me.  Yes $9 for a souvlaki on a pita...that was microwaved.  Now i realize I should take some blame for this, once I heard that microwave going I should have asked what the hell was going on but It was late and I was hungry.

The worst part about this ordeal is when I got home to eat it.  So I'm thinking maybe he had previously grilled it  because he didn't want to cook anymore that night, which is absurd to begin with.  I open the thing up and realize it was never grilled. For some bizarre reason this place makes their souvlaki in the oven.  Oven!  Not only that, it was drum stick and thigh meat, dark meat for a souvlaki? It honestly looked like food that was pulled out of a dumpster and previously eaten.

 How many more cues do I need before I realize I shouldn't eat this?  Apparently more because I then decided to smell it.  It smelled gross and old and because I'm that stupid I decided to actually try eating the thing.  I can honestly say it was the WORST thing I've ever eaten in my life.  I've cooked food before and forgotten it in the fridge for a week, this looked way worse and and smelled 10 times as bad so I'm guessing the souvlaki was two weeks old.  I have no clue how this place still exists, the food is disgusting and way overpriced."}
{"text":"bland and overpriced. much better souvali you can get from other greek places for the same price."}
{"text":"I went in for a Greek salad one day and he made it, it was small and it was priced outrageously.  I should have asked the price beforehand.  

I made this mistake twice.  I went in late after a pub crawl with my husband and we ordered pitas.  The prices are not listed.  As we were waiting for our order I confided in my hubby that I'm pretty sure I was ripped off before by the place.  He asked the price and the guy wouldn't give him an answer and just kept saying \"what does it matter?\"  He charged us $20 for 2 pitas!!!  What could we do?  We went to pay debit and he tried to charge us $40!!!!  

Yeah, we'll just take care of that in cash, buddy.  Never again and highly advise against this place!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the food here. I was on the Danforth in the evening to see a show. Not much open in the area for a quick bite. I went inside and ordered a Gyro. It was perfect. After a quiet meal watching the news on the big TV I enjoyed an intelligent conversation with the owner. Nice guy."}
