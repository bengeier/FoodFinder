{"text":"Tried to order delivery.  The food was 45 minutes late and cold.  The mu shu pork came with flour tortillas, and only contained approximately 2% pork.  I haven't had the heart to dig into the steamed rice yet, but I'm curious as to how they're going to fuck that up.  Even no Chinese food would be better than this.  :P  (Oh, and when I called to see when the food would arrive, the person answering the phone was unhelpful, and unapologetic.)  (Further updates: The rice was adequate, the hot and sour soup resembled luke-warm vinegar, the general tao chicken was mushy (though the sauce was okay), the spring rolls were cold, soft instead of crispy, and undercooked, and finally the beef ho fun had decent noodles but overcooked beef.  I stand by my original statement of prefering to eat nothing as opposed to having this again.)"}
{"text":"I work in the area and do the lunch buffet. For 9 bucks, fill up a styrofoam container to your heart's content, so long as you can shut the lid. Comes with a free pop. It's pretty typical Chinese fare. It's great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"While not the worst Chinese take-out I've had, I probably won't order from Golden House again.  My husband and I got the \"Mega Dinner Special,\" which is four main entrees for $30.55 (pick-up).  It's a decent amount of food for that price, enough for both of us to eat our fill for dinner, and a second meal tomorrow.  For our mains we chose: Lemon Chicken, which came looking almost like fish fry, breaded and battered filets of chicken breast, and a separate container of syrupy lemon sauce.  The sauce was not warm, and while lemony, somehow was missing a depth of flavor.  The filets were actually pretty decent white meat with crispy, fish-fry like batter, but again, not much flavor, and without the mediocre sauce, not at all reminiscent of lemon anything.  Next, the Beef Lo Mein: disappointing noodles, which looked and tasted exactly like noodles out of a package of ramen, instead of being a bit thicker and chewier as the lo mein at most other restaurants.  The beef was decent and a good quantity, but the dish really lacked flavor.  The Beef and Broccoli was very similar to the Beef Lo Mein, just not on top of the disappointing noodles and with some extra broccoli thrown in.  Finally, the Cantonese Style Sweet and Sour Pork: again, seriously lacking in flavor.  The pieces of breaded and fried pork were not the best cuts of meat, kind of chewy, and although coated in a bright orange sauce, just did not have much sweet or sour.  The veggies in the dish were fresh, but seemed like they could have used an extra 30 seconds in the wok maybe, as they were just barely on the side of  tender-crisp cooked.  In sum, it's like every dish needed some extra \"oomph\" that was just not there."}
{"text":"Ditto what Jay M. said. Generic Chinese food, decent price, quick and good selection of lunch specials. Perfect for take out when the goal is something tasty without high expectations of anything exotic.  The people that work there are super polite.   Again take out is the way to go when the weather is warm since they have no A/C or , at least it felt like that today."}
{"text":"Fantastic for take out.  Not a lot of options in the area for an affordable bite to eat. Golden House is a great, quick, and inexpensive option. Indoor seating is limited and far from 'cozy', but food quality and cost is right where it needs to be!"}
{"text":"In the world of generic chinese food, this place meets the need. We ordered delivery through Just-Eat to a friends house in midtown, and it arrived within a reasonable amount of time for a Friday night, and we had 2 combo dinners delivered for just over $20 + tip.  Admittedly, the egg roll was weak. The chicken balls had a weird dough texture which was a little too sponge-like, but the chicken inside was a big impressive chunk of white meat.  I also had a Chicken & Veg & Almond dish with Chicken Fried Rice and with the right amount of hot sauce thrown on top, I was genuinely enjoying this meal and would order it again. My friend had the Beef & Broccoli and said nothing but good things as well, and actually liked the unconventional texture of the chicken ball dough.   Cheap and adequate flavours to warrant 4 stars in my books."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best.  Their stir fries all taste the same, and pretty bland although overly salty.  I'm jot sure if it's the MSG, but I'm parched for hours after eating a meal here.  There aren't any other Chinese places close by,  so I guess this is it."}
{"text":"Been ordering take out from here for a few years.  My food has always been good, tastes fresh, not greasy and great flavour, the owners are very kind. I like combo number 4."}
{"text":"The most recent time that we were here was in February for a colleague's birthday lunch and this has been a favorite spot that we have been going to in the past whenever someone at work is celebrating a birthday because the sevice is fast (which is perfect if you are on a busy work schedule) and the food tastes great. You have the option of dining in or if you prefer, you can order ahead take out and come and pick up your order.   They have an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet special, which we partake in every time we come here, which includes either your choice of tea or a cold drink. We usually try to get there by 11:45am so that when they open the buffet, we get the food hot and fresh. However, if you come here expecting the same food variety as you would find in bigger restaurants like the Mandarin, you might be disappointed as their food selection contains the bare minimum like fried rice, noodles, dumplings, chicken wings, spring rolls, some meat and vegetable dishes. Personally, I don't mind the limited selection because the food still tastes great and is not heavily greasy like other Chinese places I've been to.  Pricewise, it costs approximately $13 per person, which isn't bad for unlimited Chinese food and friendly service, in a neighborhood surrounded by pricey restaurants and shops. Also, if you are bringing a large group, I recommend coming just before the lunch hour rush begins so that you can all sit together as seating availability in a small space like this is very limited.   Looking forward to returning here for lunch the next time we have a birthday."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review to bust this place a bit because much of my last couple of deliveries were sub-par.  I hope this place bothers to read these reviews and it kicks their @$$es enough to change their oil more often.  The wings lately have been TINY and dry and the oil they were cooked in seemed 'old.'  Same with the breaded shrimp.  One of the last times the shrimp was TOO crispy and disappointing.  The ribs were a little dry and the moo shoo park was poo - and I couldn't believe that the witch on the phone charged me TWO BUCKS extra for a few extra wraps for the moo shoo pork.  They made 90 to 95% profit on that 'upsell.'  (I notice as I proof-read my review that I meant to say the pork was 'poor' - but my Freudian slip now seems somewhat appropriate - so I'll leave it as is.)"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I have ordered pick-up a few times here.  Some dishes have been amazing and I was very impressed. Other times I have been disappointed and regretted it.  Stick to ordering meat and noodle dishes. Pass on ordering one-person combos, that are over filled with boring fried rice and bean sprouts."}
