{"text":"Love the taste of the chicken carbonara sub. Its Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Quiznos restaurants I have come across.  They are quick and efficient.  Its a quiet space. You can always find a seat even dinner or lunch rushes.  The tables are always clean.  The workers are accommodating to any changes you request to your sandwich.  Next time I am near there, I for sure will be popping by."}
{"text":"I've been here twice recently and have had excellent customer service and great food! The restaurant is always clean and the employees friendly."}
{"text":"The sandwich was sloppy and the restaurant was dirty. I love Quiznos but this location has apathetic staff who show no love or passion for the food they serve. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I come to this Quiznos frequently and I always receive great service. They even come out to the table to ask how everything was, often offering to heat up my cookie! I can't remember the last time a fast food restaurant gave this kind of service. The subs are always good to! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't check in expecting a $1 off coupon! I checked in 6/16/15 and it gave me a coupon which expired October 2014 which they didn't allow me to use.   I've visited this location several times and used coupons. Rather frustrating that it didn't work this time.   Food and customer service has always been average. I guess typical for most Quiznos."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Their bread is always fresh.  Nice to see Joanna again!"}
{"text":"Daniel is the manager here - and he remembers his customers by name.  This is tucked away behind FedEx Kinkos and McDonalds at Sardis Rd. North and Monroe Rd.  My daughters absolutely LOVE the Sammy Wraps, and I enjoy the large Cheesesteak Sandwich - try them today."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich/sub shop. Took me 25 minutes to get a sandwich with a friend of mine; sandwich was cold even though it was toasted. Lacks any flavor and/or seasoning. Way too expensive for what you get. Employees took their sweet time during lunch hour, and not to mention there was only one person making sandwiches. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Quiznos has really gone down hill. You definitely can tell that they have had to downgrade to almost nothing. Half of the condiments and veggie bins are empty. The options to put on sandwiches are super limited. Their menu is half the size it used to be and its way more expensive than the other sandwich shops. 7 dollars for an 8 inch ham and cheese that tastes like crap?"}
{"text":"Bad service. Take double the time to make subs than other quiznos. Don't have product half the time"}
{"text":"Subs are pretty decent.  For the price it's pretty awful.   $6 and change for a 5 inch sub is crazy but I will admit my sub was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Best sandwichs and great costermer service. Nanay, Michelle, Ethela Are the best. Take great care of you."}
{"text":"Paid over 15$ for two of the worst subs ever. No flavor, sloppy, just overall bad. Probably won't ever go back! Waste of money."}
{"text":"The best subs ever! The owner makes you feel extra welcome . The  mesquite chicken bacon ranch with batch 81 sauce and jalape√±os is killer!! The chicken carbonara is awesome too . Excellent service always ,and I go there about once a week"}
{"text":"I purchased an $8 Groupon good for $16 for this Quiznos.  You'd think it should be pretty simple for someone of High School graduate age to ring up an order, subtract $16 and then give me the correct total, right?  WRONG!!!!!  They took off $7.36 pre-tax and then $8 post-tax.  The entire $16 should have been subtracted PRE-TAX like a coupon (in fact, like their combo discount).  But no!  Their method gyps the Groupon user out of an additional $1.34 on a $16 Groupon, on top of their outrageous prices because they're located in a strip casino food court.  STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the employees and manager here! They're extremely personable and helpful and even remember all of my orders right when I walk into the door! The subs are always toasted to perfection and the restaurant is always super clean. The employees are fast and efficient and have never messed up my order."}
{"text":"The fountain machine is typically out of ice,  and they put so little toppings  on their subs,  the sandwich itself is only a centimetre or two thick when squeezed.  The food looks nothing like advertised,  don't waste your money with this location"}
{"text":"Nicest gentleman here making subs today and the man at register was nice. Great sub so good"}
{"text":"Thank you for ruining my day, Quizno's 991.  I was craving a nice fresh  and I decided to stop at this location as it is close to my home and was on the way.  I was craving a very simple thing.  How do you ruin it??  I just wanted an oven roasted turkey sandwich.  The meat looked like the bottom of the barrel and she didn't even both to separate it or anything.  She just plunked it down.  Asked if I wanted tomatoes and proceeded to place two old rubbery wobbly tomatoes on the sandwich.  I was craving the fresh purple onion and mushrooms I'm used to.  I tell her I want lettuce, mushrooms, and onions.  I see something weird and dark going on my sandwich....I realized that they don't have the fresh sliced mushrooms here...they are those dark rubbery canned ones.  EW What??  The onion was thick slices completely unsuitable for a sandwich.  At least the lettuce seemed fresh- green, and crispy.  Worst sandwich I've had in a long time.  I'm going back to my Quiznos on Craig to get the taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Always consistent on the food, I love Quiznos!  The double toasted bread is amazing! It took me a while to find a Quiznos near me.. I drive at least 39 min to get here!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the new owners are great.  The previous owners were forced to close down and the new guys have been in there for about a year.  I go in about once a week and they are super friendy and very fast service.  Highly recommend this locaiton."}
{"text":"How is this place still open?? Quiznos isn't a horrible sandwich place, but this particular one sure is! I don't even think the employees know what the word 'service' means and the place smells like a public toilet. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been going to this Quiznos for a while and have seen it's ups and downs. We went this week and were pretty surprised that they seem to have their act (back) together. People working were pretty friendly, they made the sandwiches right and all went as planned- shouldn't be such a big deal but these days all going as planned seems to be hard to find. Anyway, it was cool, they were cool, the sandwiches were hot- yum!"}
{"text":"My Quizno's experience today was just weird- I stopped in for a sandwich between appointments and while my sandwich was good (tuna on wheat with pickles and black olives... yum!) the staff was, um, interesting. ALL of the people working there were mumblers, like hardcore mumblers. I thought the guy in front of me was being a jerk for saying huh a million times, but then I realized that the lady was talking to the sandwich and was barely audible. I moved on to the post toasting station and wouldn't you know it- same thing. And guess what, the dude ringing me up- SAME THING! I have never had such a bizarre experience before. Where the H are the people who look at you when they talk, let alone smile at you! I'm takin a Quizno's break for a while."}
{"text":"My husband arrived at the D gates of Terminal 1 at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas with not much time prior to boarding and STARV-ING. There is a serious lack of decent food options that are quick at this terminal. One pizza place, a place to by box sandwiches, chili's too with a 40 minute wait and Quizno's.   We avoid fast food like a plague for its general low quality, high fat/calorie counts and poor nutrition. We figured a sandwich would be better than pizza, I mean how can you mess up such a simple thing as a sandwich? Ha...ha!  Now I will say this, my husband ordered some sort of cold cut variety on whole wheat that had a lot of ranch dressing on it and he said it tasted pretty good. He was so hungry I think he downed it in 4 bites. I tried to go a healthier route with their veggie guacamole and had it grilled, or was that toasted - I'm not sure - on parmesan bread. Here's my review:  Service: friendly and quick. No complaints here.  Food: Ugh. My bread was spongy, tasteless, really gross. The veggies on this veggie sandwich were black olives, TONS of diced purple onions, mushrooms and shredded iceberg lettuce. Does that sound like a veggie sandwich to you?? Does that even come close to sounding appetizing?? Where are the peppers, spinach, tomatoes?? Two layers of cheese, swiss and cheddar with a little squirt of what I think was Italian dressing and barely detectable guacamole all mushed into the lettuce. It just had no taste. A pile of tasteless unappetizing vegetables on spongy, tasteless bread. Odd thing is the sandwich looked great but did not match the flavor. I ate less than a quarter of it just to tame down the hunger pangs and the rest went in the garbage.  Two stars is for the quick friendly service, I would give zero for the food if I could. Believe me, I am one on yelp who consistently gives the benefit of the doubt to places but I advise you to go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant little Quiznos that always seems to be almost empty when I go in the evening. The staff is friendly and the place is clean; I'm not sure why they don't get more people.  Perhaps they have a bigger lunch crowd."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I've been in here a few times and every single time, the service is unacceptably slow and the customer service is really lacking. I went in there another time and not a single employee in sight. Wtf? It was in the afternoon so it's not like they were closed.  I could hear people in the back talking. I called out for someone to assist me multiple times. I waited there for 5-10 min for someone to come out and not one person answered me or even bothered to come out. What the hell is up with that?! Hello...I'm about to spend money on your damn food and you ignore a customer?  Ridiculous. The owner needs to find some better employees because these people suck. I ended up leaving and taking my business elsewhere.  UPDATE: I tried calling the store to see if I could get a hold of a manager to speak to.  The phone rang for a while before the phone was finally picked up...the person on the other line didn't say anything.  After I said \"Hello?\" the person just hung up without a word.  Seriously?  RUDE and UNACCEPTABLE.  How do you expect to run a profitable business with crappy employees like that?"}
{"text":"I visited this Quiznos location last month with a friend of mine.  The staff are extremely rude and do not seem to love their jobs.  When we poured our fountain drink into a cup there were fruit flies in our cups.  We told the owner's wife, so she gave us new cups.  I was concerned because the drink area was filthy.  It was not sanitized and if an owner thinks there is nothing wrong with fruit flies in your drink.....why are they in the service industry!!!!!!!  I eventually spoke to the Store Manager/Owner and Bhavin said \" the doors are always opening, so the flies just come in like that\".  I cannot believe this guy does not know about fruit flies.   Subway is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday during a layover.  Five hours later, I ended up with massive food poisoning that has continued through most of today. I would be wary of giving this place a chance!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for lunch occasionally over the past year and I've always been happy with how quick and friendly the service. The food and store are pretty typical for Quizno's--good and clean."}
{"text":"The place looked clean and nice but the food they prepared for me was average. Tasted great though and I really like the \"foot long\" sandwich that they serve. The bread was served after baked and it just melts in your mouth. This Quiznos I would recommend to many people."}
{"text":"There is nothing inherently wrong with this Quizno's...except it never seems open.  Yes, it seems to have been open at some point because the sign is still up outside.  But whether I stop by on a Sunday for lunch or a Tuesday for dinner, I can't figure this place out.  Perhaps I just come at the wrong time.  As an ex-girlfriend once said, timing is everything.  (Wait, that totally came out wrong...uhhh...never mind.)  And if the timing always seems wrong, customers can't support a business they'd like to support.  Which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"About two years ago I used to go to this Quiznos several times a week and it was always a fine experience. When my boyfriend said he never sees Quiznos around anymore, I knew where to go! Mistake. Inside is a little run down but no big deal. We ordered our food and I was paying attention to my phone, not the ordering process. I looked up to ask the employee to add banana peppers, and when he opened the container I could see that they were changing to an orange color. Ew. We got our sandwiches and I got some raspberry lemonade, and we went to sit outside. We knew in the first few bites something was not right, and I took a sip of my drink to wash away the sandwich but that was just wonky tasting too! We decided not to finish our food, and I wish we had decided that after the first bite. I'm not one to complain, even when something is really bad, except we both got sick! I had a mild stomach ache almost immediately after and took some tums. My boyfriend got sick that night and has been throwing up all day, I was fine until this afternoon when it finally hit me, I've thrown up five times in the last hour and a half. Please don't eat at this location until they clean it up!!"}
{"text":"Refused to honor a head office coupon and then treated us rudely. Decent food but customer service needs to be addressed. Thankfully there are plenty of restaurants around us so I will not need to return."}
{"text":"Terrible! I came there twice, they overcharged me on EVERYTHING I ordered. When I argued, they refused to adjust the charge according to their advertised menu and said it was not their fault. Do not buy anything from them. They are not honest people."}
{"text":"The staff here are always cheerful and accomodating.  I love Quiznos sandwiches in general and this is a great store."}
{"text":"Oh Quizno's you are a damn shame.  A damn dirty shame.   Thinking, oh my they might have something I can eat, I promptly waited in line. I ordered a regular and told you how much I would not like olives on my sandwich. I also told you how I like light vinaigrette on it as well.   But no, you did not listen. You gave me a wet, warm and crappy looking sandwich with traces of olives.   Fracking AWESOME!   Thank you so much for charging me 8 bucks for this horrendous meal. I stuffed it down as I had to run, but I should have thrown it back and asked for my money back. Ah well."}
{"text":"Quiznos is amazing- so many levels above subway. This one is pretty good but the lunch kinda is long at 12 and they move slowww. Not much to say about sandwiches, but it's always clean and the food is great."}
{"text":"The couple who runs this Quiznos are the nicest people ever, and they make your order quickly (as quick as the Quiznos oven conveyor belt runs) and it tastes great!  So if you are in the Rancho/Alta, Ranco/Charleston area, stop by and get yourself a great meal. You will be happy you did.  -P"}
{"text":"I went to Quiznos for the first time, and I must say I wasn't overly impressed.  The food wasn't bad, but for the price you paid, it could have thrilled me a little bit more.  The chicken noodle soup was way too salty and the chili, although good, was too watery.  For me, I think I'll stick to Mr. Sub"}
{"text":"I personally love Quiznos! It's the best place to get a delicious, fresh, warm sub for lunch. ITS SO YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and the owner has always been there -- greeting you as you walk in the door, asking how your day is going while the sandwich comes through the conveyor, ringing up the order, and sincerely thanking you for your business. I decided I just had to compliment this business as it's top-notch all around with well-prepared food, fresh ingredients, and the friendliest service in a quick-casual restaurant I've come across.  I highly recommend this Quiznos and agree with a previous reviewer -- it IS one of a kind. If you are anywhere near Flamingo & Maryland Pkwy you won't regret checking it out."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and we always enjoy our experience and the food! Thank you for the discount coupons- keep them coming!!!"}
{"text":"Came by a few months ago. Charged me twice for tea and didn't know how to do a refund. She called the manager on her cell phone and refunded me. Two weeks later, the money isn't in my bank account. It wasn't worth coming back and complaining.   Establishment is dirty...I've seen a cobweb or two lurking about. Probably will never be back..."}
{"text":"Extremely clean place, very friendly staff and delicious subs! They even gave my son a free chocolate chip cookie! I will definitely bring my family back again."}
{"text":"Great food. The employees are very friendly and the service is quick. By far best Quiznos I have ever been too and definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Eating here was a last minute decision as my restaurant of choice was unexpectedly closed.   Poor customer service, wont return"}
{"text":"What is so hard about making a sandwich? It seems so easy, yet both Quiznos and Subway can't seem to master it. I have made two recent trips to Quiznos and have been totally disappointed both times. I mean, can I have some food on my sandwich? Just a thought. The servings are miniscule. All I could taste was soft bread, lettuce and some sort of paste (was it tuna?). Awful. And the price? Holy cow! The first time was $5 for a couple of mouthfuls. The second time was almost $9 for slightly more. Next time, I'll just go to the store and do it myself."}
{"text":"I live in the area and on the weekends I'm always looking for a fast meal. The $4 Torpedo they have going now can't be beat."}
{"text":"A leg of the Quiznos franchises decided to go their own way and become \"Dad's Deli\". This store is not one of them, it's still a Quiznos. I admit I'm a Quiznos fanboy, but this one is one of the better stores and it's hidden back in the corner of this shopping center.  The food here is good and the staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and friendly staff. I live in Southern California, where it's getting more and more difficult to find a Quiznos. I try to pop in for a sandwich any time I see one these days. This location provided me with the perfectly toasted and delicious sandwich I've come to expect from Quiznos. Store is clean and staffed by friendly people who seemed enthusiastic about making my food. Wish there was one of these closer to home."}
{"text":"My wife's first time at Quiznos and my first time since high school. This Quiznos is great! Food was excellent! Isabelle was great and helped make sure our coupon worked when the other staff couldn't get it working! Thank you"}
{"text":"No problems with food quality, I hear they are under new management. However, they have no condiment bar. I've never heard of a Quizno's that doesn't! I need my horseradish sauce, guys."}
{"text":"What's a good day in my books? Heck, any day that involves a trip to my local Quiznos.   It was a blustery, cold, rainy and dreary day, so I decided to put some skip in my step with a little lunch-time trip to this Quiznos. Well, I didn't actually go to this location, I stayed at work while my good friend Steven hopped on his bike to fetch us some lunch.   I had convinced him today was the perfect day for Quiznos, and that he absolutely had to try the Mesquite Chicken sandwich on Rosemary Parmesan (or MSRP for short). He had never had it, and was skeptical. For days we had talked about getting it, but it hadn't panned out. I'm glad today we finally took the leap to get toasted.   Steven got food for the whole crew here at my work. Meghan got a small MSRP and a broccoli soup, yum! Steven and I both got large MSRPs, and Sam got a veggie one because she doesn't eat meat. Thank you, Sam.  He put our orders in his fall jacket, and was off. I could hardly wait to hold my lovely MSRP in my hands. I love MSRP. It is my favourite sandwich.   While Steven was away getting lunch, I decided to have a little waiting fun. So I took out a pad of paper and grabbed a nearby pencil. I did a little doodling, and then thought it could be fun to have a little game of tic-tac-toe vs myself. So I drew a # on the paper, and started the game.  First I put an X in the middle. Interesting move, I thought to myself. Now, all that was available was everything but the middle. It was time to draw the O. I put it in the bottom right corner. I knew I had to act fast with the next move to make my opponent nervous with my tic-tac-strategy. I quickly put an X above the O. Now I just needed one more X to win. But guess who caught on? Mr. O. I put an O to the left of the middle X. Uh oh, this game was getting good. I put an X above the middle X. O put it below the middle X. I put an X in the bottom left. Then an O in the top left and an X in the top right. Oh my gosh. I had lost against myself! Well, that's okay, it's better to have two losers than one winner I always say. By the time I had finished my game, Steven was back with lunch.  He handed me my MSRP and I joked and pretended it was heavy and I couldn't lift it. After a laugh, I thanked Steven and took the first bite of my MSRP. Wow. Words literally cannot describe. Have you ever seen The Starry Night by Van Gogh? Picture that on your tongue. Now times that by one million times.  Thanks Quiznos. I'll always love you. Well just the MSRP everything else is kind of rough.   Your pal,  Mitch"}
{"text":"Very slow during lunch.  Guy put on the wrong sauce (should've been peppercorn) which essentially, ruined my sub.  I normally would've taken it back, but the line was so long, I didn't wanna screw over anyone else's lunch. Their toaster needs re-calibrated as our sammiches weren't very \"toasty.\"  Weak.  Go to Jersey Mikes instead."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Quiznos, I turned to my wife and said \"This place will never make it\"...that was 2011 and most locations near me have closed..Reason???  Aside from cutting down portions to lower prices, the process takes too long!!!  Your profit is made between 11:30 - 1:30,,,,You need to serve people quickly....The lady in front of us ordered 4 sandwiches to go....She had so many choices, the order took 10 minutes, then into the slow conveyor belt for 10 minutes more...many people behind us walked out !!!!!  Simplify the menu and go back to large portions and maybe I'll go back, but I doubt it !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Grubhub.  Food was horrible.  Ordered the roast beef sub.  It was supposed to come with peppers and onions and mozzarella cheese.  It did not.  No cheese, no peppers, soggy bread.  Funny tasting dip sauce.  Only thing that was ok was the chips.  Also, really expensive, don't order from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now. Food is good but service is sloooow as molasses in winter time."}
{"text":"Black angus steak house sandwich ---oh yes. Awesome little treat. My hubby and I shared it and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Horrible location. Convinced they're ripping off on meat and toppings. Never going again."}
{"text":"The \"hot\" sandwich came out just warm(as a result of it being left out after it was toasted) and I feel I got shafted on the portions. There are definitely better options than this."}
{"text":"Sometimes it isn't just about the good food. The owners are always here and always super friendly. Eat here."}
{"text":"This Quizno's is a pretty good Quizno's.  The dudes there are very efficient and get things done.  I've always enjoyed the toasty subs and peppers you can find at Quizno's.  However, I am disappointed by a recent product I purchased at this location.  I decided to try out a \"bullet.\"  $3 for a 6 inch sandwich - sounds perfect.  Unfortunately this \"bullet\" sandwich is tiny.  Kind of like a breadstick with sandwich toppings.  So, yes, it is 6 inches long - but it is not very wide.  I'm tired of restaurant value offerings that aren't really values.  I'm also tired of misleading menu pictures."}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly and helpful.    The food is delicious.  The service is fast.   All around great place to grab food."}
{"text":"It's a best sub place ever very good food welcoming place clean and I just love it so happy to find this Quiznos."}
{"text":"This plaza sucks for food and this place is no exception. Another place that would be out of business were it not for the lunchtime office crowd. If hwy7 wasn't such a disaster everyone would cross the 400 and go to longo's or michaelangelos for a way better sandwich"}
{"text":"The food was good but the staff wasn't really welcoming nor friendly. It's like they are just there to do their job and go home. It was my first time at that location. Didn't feel welcomed at all."}
{"text":"Sandwich was skimpy and they overcharged my on my combo deal, i'll be back but only for my refund."}
{"text":"Never come to this location...We went twice in a week. Poor service!!! The guy poured the whole bottle of sauce on my sandwich by the time we reached home it was soggy on the sides and bottom! He was pretty annoyed because we kept asking for diff stuff on the sandwich....well thats his job! He is supposed to serve customers. And we are paying for it, so why does he have to have an attitude?!! GREAT!! Not worth $8.39+TAX!!! Seriously I am never coming back!!! I can find a better location."}
{"text":"I've been coming here at this location since they opened.  I have always been treated nicely and my sandwiches are always hot and fresh.  The owner is always nice and she's always joking around teaching and training her employees.  They always offer everyone the rewards program as well.   A few new faces,  they had hired a manager and she only lasted a bit.  When I came in a few times she was just standing there by the register and chair next to  her.  They ran out of tomatoes didn't seem to bother to slice them for Nicholas.  Who has helped me the last few times I've gone in.  Glad she's gone."}
{"text":"They messed up our order really bad but the food was pretty good just annoying that they can't even put things on the right sandwich , plus when you are paying 8$ for it it better come out right...."}
{"text":"This is the only sub place that I go to. Over the past years I have always gotten amazing service and the food is fresh and tastes spot on. On of the owners is always there and I'm sure that is why the quality it always so hi. If you want a great sandwich make sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"I go here every weekend for lunch.  I love it!  Great service done timely. Clean!  And filling. I've eaten at other quiznos but this one by far the best and cleanest"}
{"text":"I love the Quiznos in our neighborhood here.  The owner of this Quiznos goes out of his way to ensure his restaurant is always clean, well staffed, and has fresh ingredients.  The bread is always fresh and the ingredients are as well.  The condiments are fresh and never out.  The air conditioning is really good to so when your hot in July you know it's going to be a nice lunch.  I highly recommend this Quiznos."}
{"text":"The lady was super rude, I couldn't hear her bc she was whispering while asking me what I wanted on my sandwich, when I told her I couldn't hear her she rolled her eyes and didn't not attempt to speak louder. The food was probably the worst food I've tasted this trip to Vegas. And for being a franchise restaurant that's not impressive. I will never give this place business again."}
{"text":"Quiznos is Quiznos as another reviewer said.  If you like Quiznos you'll love this location.  The staff is friendly and if you're a regular who works downtown like me they'll get to know you and remember your order.  The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.  My personal favorite is the flat-bread sandwiches and the soup but the salads are good as well."}
{"text":"First off!! BEST customer service ever!!  Little Asian lady who is always there is so sweet and genuine.  Quiznos has delicious subs at an affordable price. They put way more meat than Subway and love their fixins bar.  Love the vinaigrette!!  Clean restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy a sub from Quiznos, but they have to be made properly otherwise they aren't that great. Luckily when I have visited this location they have been pretty good about making the sandwich the right way and the taste results have been excellent.  I have had trouble with some Quiznos locations taking coupons in the past, but I haven't had any issues at this location yet, so I am happy about that. I also love their cinnamon sugar cookie, which I have to order every time!  One issue I have had here is that the soda machines have had nasty pop. Workers really need to stay on top of that, but otherwise I have been pleased with my visits here."}
{"text":"Srisi is a amazing customer service agent. I love her positive attitude. I stop here hungry at 5am and she assist me with my order with a great early morning attitude. That is the best way to start a fly. Thanks Srisi"}
{"text":"Today is Wednesday, January 28, 2015 and this Quiznos location is closed & the phone number has been disconnected."}
{"text":"This was the worst/most expensive sandwich i ever had in my life.  I paid $9 for a steak sandwich that had no steak. One paper thin slice of meat on one half of the foot long sub was all i got and everything is supposedly prepared ahead of time so they wont/cant fix it.  And the actual bread was salty ...way too salty. and the sauce that came with it tastes like it was rancid.  The whole thing was inedible.  WORST ever. Dont waste your money."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, and haven't had any issues. The staff was very friendly both times, and the sandwiches were fine. The facility is clean and actually kind of big for a Quizno's. It is in a weird complex so it's easy to miss. It's one of the few places near my work open late enough that I can grab a quick bite if I don't bring my lunch."}
{"text":"Trying a breakfast sandwich and not a good choice.  Barely any egg, bacon is minced and bread soggy"}
{"text":"Yuck. Ordered a tuna sandwich. Pure slop and didn't even taste great. Everything fell out the edges. I found bits of bacon in with the tuna. I heard this company is going down the pan .... hardly surprising. I ate half on my flight and threw the rest in the trash."}
{"text":"We all had the same size sub but the one I had was teeny tiny.  Ingredients were sparse and the staff was stressed and got mad at another patron in front of me.  Not my fave place."}
{"text":"Great toasted sandwich. The owners are very nice. And they have Miss Vickies Salt & Vinegar Chips! They are so hard to find."}
{"text":"I love Quiznos, but was not a fan of this location. The pickles had an odd taste and the honey mustard tasted a little rancid. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since a review here, so I'll attempt to right some wrongs. It is much cleaner than all other reviews make it out to be. All the food was in the proper place, nothing was on the floor, and there was no smell in the air (although a lady walked in after me and mentioned something about a smell, but neither myself nor the two employees could pick up the smell). The employees were helpful, and pleasant, and got my rather complex order done quickly. No rudeness that I could see at all. Also, they offer delivery (and were even offering a $5 coupon for your next delivery when I was in there today).  Some complains though: -The raspberry lemonade was out, and some of the drinks were not working too. The fountain drinks I couldn't care less about but no raspberry lemonade? Unforgivable.  -The employee who made my sandwiches did mess up my first order. But, once he figured out his mistake, he apologized and said he must have misheard me. He then asked if I wanted a new sandwich, but the mistake was minor (regular size as opposed to small size), so I said I didn't care. - No condiment bar. Could be because of the size of the place, but this is the first Quizno's I have ever seen without one. Weird.   All in all, ignore the previous comments, since they are from a few years ago. This place is much cleaner now, and the staff seems much nicer. Give it another chance, Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My only gripe with Quizno's in general, is why the heck doesn't my sub dosen't look like the commercial I just watched on T.V. ? Also the combination deals can be a little confusing. They ask you what you want on your sub, but they put very little on. What's up with that ? then your stuck asking for more, and then they look at you with those deer in the headlight kinda stare. Whatever.   I still go once in a while for my sub fix !"}
{"text":"Worst Quizno's in Charlotte. Can not take an order over the phone correctly, under cooked food, very rude staff and then yells at customers if they get upset with bad service. Not sure how they are still in business. Will never step foot in there again.  * Guess their poor treatment of customers and filthy conditions finally caught up with them as they have shut down. The place is up for lease.*"}
{"text":"It's a Quiznos, but it's not run as well as it should be. I think this location has gone through several management changes over the years. I just recall having good food served to me by people who seemed like they didn't want to be there and that always affects my experience overall.  I remember coming in with a coupon that I received via email from Quiznos Canada and I tried to use it at this location and it was barely looked at and refused. I remember asking \"really? I can't use it here?\" and no real explanation was given. That was the start of my souring of this place.  I feel like if it was managed a little better, I'd probably go here more as I do love Quiznos in general. Meh, I'll check back on it every now and then and just hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Great subs and service. Always a pleasant experience. Dining area is smaller than most but accommodating enough if you want to eat-in."}
{"text":"This location has the best customer service I have experienced when I order take out. I called in the order and they were very clear about explaining everything. When I went to pick up the order they greeted me with a huge smile and called me by name. I had never been there before and they were extremely helpful to make sure each order was correct and remind me of the options for the additional items that I could add from the veggi bar. They offered to help me to the car and gave me a complimentary drink as a thanks. I raved about them when I returned to my office and will go back there any time I am wanting a quiznos sub. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Adjusted shift to work a late Friday and ended up here for dinner before punching out. I have done my best to eat pencils and avoid ever having to come back here.  On this particular occasion, I was out ranked.  What I found was a completely different experience.  The two super friendly ladies making delicious sandwiches behind the counter were hustling all the while with smiles on their faces.  I wonder just how successful this franchise would be having these two wonder woman rocking the lunch rush?  My sandwich was awesome.  The side of happiness added to my combo meal made it pop!"}
{"text":"Pretty much all Quiznos suck!  And they just raised the price!? The bread is like a bread stick! Way too skimpy on ingredients, and way too expensive! No wonder they're are all closing down!"}
{"text":"Decent. They have pretty good food. but it isn't anything to get excited about"}
{"text":"Darn, I hate to give Quizno's a bad rating but this is all because my S/O and I got sick the day after and had similar symptoms.  There was only one lady making sandwiches and it took a while for her to get to us. She apologized for the long wait, hence 2 stars.  And what the hell is Quizno's without a condiment bar?! I need my peppers and other sauces. It was also disappointing that their soda machine lacked pepsi/coke! Who does that?!   I'm sorry Quizno's, honestly, I really like you and missed you in California but please, fix the most pertinent things there!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally consider Quizno's to be comfort food, but there's something comforting about having a sandwich here before boarding my flight home to Atlanta.  There are lots of other options for food on this concourse and I always bypass them all for a sub.  It's unfortunate that you pay a premium for eating in the airport.  A regular combo costs more than $10. Sometimes I guess it's worth it, though. Especially when it makes you feel sooo good inside."}
{"text":"After all the hoopla and word of mouth, I decided for a change of scenery for a quick and different dinner. The layout of the store was no different than any other sub place and being able to see how they reheat/remoisturize the meat, lets just say I started to regret my decision. So giving the benefit of the doubt I placed my order(chicken carbonara sub+chicken noodle soup) and started to watch the show. It was all put together in about ten minutes, from prep to package, not bad! Between the two of us the bill was $23.00, so for two soups and two(if you want to call them)gourmet subs, that's pretty typical. Well, when we got home and unravelled the feast, the sub looked like it was put on a whole wheat french baget rather than a 9in. bun and very skimpy on all the fillings, as for the soup, it was so infused with salt it was barely paletable! The broth could have been filtered and used for an aquarium. This could have been just one of those bad experiences at a individual store of the chain but after this visit I think we'll stick to our usual sub place that's our go to choice if we feel like a change of scenery!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. I usually go to Sprouts for my sandwich fix, but was feeling adventerous when I had lunch plans with a coworker.   I said to her, \"Sprouts or Quiznos?\" Her response, \"You choose, but choose wisely.\"  So after a morning of debate, I pulled the trigger (I like making decisions), and said Quiznos it is.   I had a prime rib sandwich. It was tasty, and toasty. Of course. It wasn't the best sandwich I had ever had, but it was certainly sufficient, and filling. I don't remember what my coworker had, but I remember she had soup. At the end of our meal, we were both ready for food comas.   The staff is pretty friendly, and the store (and bathrooms) are clean.  Fun fact about this location. Miss Arizona 2009 eats here. I've never met her, but I bet if I did, I'd give her my number and we would hit it off. Her photo is on the wall. Supposedly she works next door in the office building.  In any case, I'd come back. This is a good Quiznos."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.  The food is pretty good.  I like the Angus Beef Sandwich a lot."}
{"text":"Do you like mayonnaise, I mean, do you really, really like mayo?  Then you will love Quiznos.  They might have something that doesn't come drenched in some fatty sauce, but I haven't seen it.    I agree with the other review here - this is another place that would totally be out of business if not for the lunch time office crowd."}
{"text":"Worst Quiznos...employees are not interested in their product."}
{"text":"Extremely nice Asian lady behind the counter. The honey mustard chicken was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Quiznos is fast food but most sandwich places ask you when you order. Do you want cheese, pickles etc. When I questioned them they challenged me. What happened to the customer is always right? Coldest toasted sub that I have ever ordered. Hope I don't get good poisoning! Last time I visit there. Employees need an attitude transplant."}
{"text":"As Quiznos has slid closer and closer to irrelevancy, the range of quality of the food from store to store has never varied more. This is one of the worst - they don't cook the chicken the same way, and the only lettuce they keep in stock is iceberg. Due to the lack of food options in Ahwatukee, however, I'm the closest thing this place has to a regular (it's always empty). Sigh."}
{"text":"They are pretty busy at lunch rush, but the staff are all friendly and the food is very good.  Considering how much lunch business they get, they can get you in and out fast."}
{"text":"First trip here 12/22/14 11:45am. Door wide open, plenty of parking. There were other customers inside. I've never been in a Quiznos before today but I did look at the menu online before driving there.  The kid taking my order was difficult to hear because of the glass barrier and his tiny voice. The Asian lady at the register was somewhat hard to understand because of her accent and rapid speech. She was busy training employees and yelling \"no-no-no\" a lot trying to get things done correctly.  Comparing my sandwich (classic Italian) to the photos online I hardly recognized it when he folded, sliced and wrapped it. Comparing the advertised photo to the actual food was quite a shocker, it was nearly flat as cardboard and came out rather small.  I ate it at home and re-nuked it for 30 seconds. The sandwich wasn't too bad really. I also tried their broccoli cheese soup which was much better than I anticipated.  Summary: the photos online are roughly double the actual size, their soups are good. Service is fast, prices good, parking plentiful with easy access off Southern and Higley. All in all a good first experience.   I gave them three stars instead of four for being overall hard to hear and understand, and very deceptive photography/advertising."}
{"text":"I prefer Quiznos over Subway and Jimmy Johns. Subs come out nice and toasted and they have more toppings, sauces, etc. I also like the pickle/pepper bar.   Staff here is really nice. Only down side is there is not a lot of dining space and it can get crowded around lunch. Sucks there's only 2 shops in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Love the meatballs. At least they make them fresh when you ask for them. I don't mind waiting a few minutes for fresh food. Overall very tasty. Will go back for a carbonara next"}
{"text":"Easily the worst Quiznos I have visited, and that is saying a great deal.   When I first went in, I was ignored for the first 3 minutes even though there was no one else in the store.  I was then greeted by one of the employees, and her accent was so thick I could not understand half of what she said.  I made it clear to her I had a gift certificate and asked what I could order.  She pointed to the $6, $8, and $10 combo they were offering, and said it was good if you wanted a drink.  After I made my order for the combo, and I was being rung up by someone else, I was told I could not use my gift certificate with the combo.  I asked why, and the server became rude and combative.  I asked to speak to a manager to resolve why two different people told me two different things.  I was handed a phone after a minute and was told by a rude woman I could not have the combo, and without getting a chance to say a word, was hung up on.  Just avoid this location if you can.  There are other shops in the area and hopefully they are ran by better people who are not out to give Quiznos a bad name.  I do not understand why Quiznos allows these franchise shops to be so rude to customers, but it surely cannot be good for business."}
{"text":"I've always loved the blank angus steak sandwich, so when I have time to drive across town to get Quiznos, I'm happy.  Unfortunately that doesn't happen often.  The reason for this five star rating though is truly more due to the quality of service I've received here.  Tonight I met the owners of this location, and was extremely impressed.  First, the wife was very conversational and sweet while she made my sandwich.  I also then met her husband who was friendly as well.    Then a situation happened in which a homeless man came in and immediately started coming towards me (I was the only customer at the time), but the owner (husband) intercepted and made sure to handle the situation.  The man wanted us to call 9-1-1 for his feet hurting.  I truly felt bad for the man and watched as the EMTs attempted to help him, but it was a mental illness that needed to be addressed more than any actual injury.  Anyways, the point is that the owner handled it very well in making sure that it didn't become a big scene and protected me from feeling scared.  (I'm a young woman so men approaching me can sometimes be scary.)  Overall I was just very impressed by the owners' customer service.  And, that sandwich is just so good, it gets 5 stars too."}
{"text":"I needed something quick to eat before I boarded my flight back to NY and there was slim picking at this terminal.  I haven't had Quiznos in years and probably for good reason.  I had the chicken carbonara.  It was pretty much exactly what I expected from a Quiznos located in the airport.  The bread was mediocre and everything was overly salty. Good thing I had lots of water for the flight home."}
{"text":"I dont even know why anyone likes this place. All their meats taste exactly the same, like nasty rubber salami.  And there was a fly in my soup.  Even their commercials fucking suck. Did they really think Spongemonkeys singing the most annoying song in the world would make people want to buy sandwiches...?  I'm all set with Quiznos. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"It's Quiznos.  It's mediocre food.  It's conveniently downtown.  Convenient mediocrity gets eaten."}
{"text":"I'm sure the ongoing battle between Subway and Quiznos (Battle of the Bun?) won't be ending anytime soon, and it creates a bit of a conflict having both a Subway AND a Quiznos in the same plaza, located so closely to where you live. Decisions!  Lets get right down to it. With these 2 locations in particular, Subway is by far the more, ahem, ghetto. It just attracts a crowd of noisy hooligans (and like that, I've become my father), which isn't the end of the world. When I go to Quiznos, it always seems more relaxing and cleaner. On the other hand, their service seems to be a little worse than Subway's. I dont know, sometimes they just seem distracted, and I have to repeat myself. With Subway, you get a little more bun, and you can see them preparing it. With Quiznos, I've always found it odd that the counter is like a sub pharmacy, and you can't see what the hell's going on with your sub until it's in the toaster.  As for the sandwiches themselves, I've always thought Quiznos' bread and toppings were more fresh and flavourful.  You really can't go wrong either way, but I think in the end, Quiznos has the edge."}
{"text":"Fabulous Wednesday $5 Sub: Baja Chicken! The saucing is amazing, BBQ with Chipotle mayo. The chicken is soft and tender. They grill the onions and cheese through, I love getting double cucumber, banana peppers, spinach and tomato. My son wanted extra sauce, and they tripled the sauce which he LOVED! Thank you."}
{"text":"l eat here weekly the place is clean and people are  friendly  food is absolutly delicious but i just dont know why everytime the price is different.i got exactly same Sandwich everytime but different employees charges different,  the prices have gradually increased from $7 toal most$10 i wish everytime they charge the same Price."}
{"text":"OK I hear people say Quiznos is better than Subway. Now that I think about it, jeez if Subway is the comparison  what the hell am i thinking. Anyway, Quiznos sucked. Food quality is betwwen Eek and uggh. Service was slooooooooow. Taste was bad...to really bad. Frst and last time."}
{"text":"Quiznos is not a place I frequent. The prices are high for sandwiches! But it was wet and cold the other day and I wanted some soup so I stopped in. I ordered a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup and a small italian sandwich. I also added a drink and the total was around $10 bux. The sandwich was a decent size for a small and was filling. The soup however, was bland. Even salt and pepper didn't help much. It tasted watered down and not good. I would go back here again maybe for a sandwich but not soup."}
{"text":"My son is a huge fan of Quizno's but we haven't had any luck locating a location in Las Vegas... until NOW.  Went there for lunch the other day.  He ordered the Baja chicken sandwich and I had the chicken carbonara sandwich.  Both were prepared well, all toppings were fresh and enjoyable.  The dining room was well-lit, natural sunlight filling the space and the employees were very friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed our meal combos and will definitely be returning here next time we're in northwest Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Go get a subway. Or better a thai sub !!!  Tastier!  No wonder why quiznos is going down. Where are the vedgies man? ;)  And Fondue meat doesnt make it for me.  Not enough meat munching factor!   Looks this french guy tegiewing in english.  He invent expressions just to get across it!! ;)"}
{"text":"Really good customer service by the owners and very clean and awesome food!!! First time in a Quiznos and I prefer it over subway any day."}
{"text":"I only ate here for breakfast so I can't speak to the quality of their lunch/dinner food, but the breakfast sandwich was good. Egg and cheese, with generous quantities of both, and it tasted good. At $5.49, though more expensive than non-airport food and/or airport food in other locations, it was still a much better value and better flavor/quantity than comparable food in the same terminal. And they actually had a breakfast option without meat! All in all, I was satisfied."}
{"text":"Girl behind counter is being very negative and will not give a refund for those of us who have been waiting for more than 25 minutes for a sandwich. She is being very unprofessional and when we asked for her manager she said she was in her break."}
{"text":"Love the management, a little frustrating when the lady who speaks English as a second language is working because there is a huge language barrier.  The gentleman who works on the weekend is awesome.  He took all the orders and was doing all the work when the language barrier lady was working.  He hid his frustration and worked quickly to make all the customers satisfied."}
{"text":"They make a really good sandwich,  I had a chicken something.  The service was fast and the price was fair.  This location is tidy and the employees were friendly enough even during a busy lunch rush.  It's a real shame that corporate greed forced so many of the franchisees out of business. (One poor guy was so distraught he killed himself in his restaurant's bathroom according to a Forbes story.)  It's a minimum 15 minute drive for me to get to this location and that's just not gonna be a regular thing for me, but maybe if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Doing a catering order. The manager was extremy helpful. She answered all question, and was more then accommodating with substitutes. If any business lunch or event catering comes up again, be sure I'll come back."}
{"text":"I just attempted using your online ordering service. It said you were 7 miles away and then glitched out.   Tried calling this store to ask if you delivered to my location. First employee didn't know, and passed me to another employee. 2nd employee was rude and said \"I don't know. Check online. It'll tell you\" and hung up on me.   Your lazy employees just cost you a sale.   I'm downloading Ubereats app. Forget you."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. We got there, mind you 10 minutes before close, and they already had their closed sign off. The woman in the window smiled and waived because she clearly wasn't going to help. So I called. Asked her why they were closed before they were actually closed, she said \"ma'am what do you want me to do, you try working 14 hours a week.\" Excuse me, I drove 45 minutes out of my way to enter this establishment. Completely unsatisfactory behavior. Whether you own, work, or run an establishment, this is not how you conduct proper business. I will be calling corporate and I do not recommend wasting your time or energy on this particular Quiznos."}
{"text":"The food is the same as any other Quizno's but this location took forever because there was only 1 employee working when I went...seemed like it took 10-15 min to make my 2 sandwiches and get my transaction closed out. I couldn't imagine how long it would've taken had there been a line! Haven't been to Quizno's in a while but it seems like prices went up....don't remember a sandwich being 8 or 9 bucks!"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service at this location! Classic Italian is always a good choice and this time was no exception. Fantastic staff! I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I haven't seen a Quiznos in quite some time, they've all closed in my area.  I was driving by and saw this location and it was OPEN!! I was so excited I made a u turn and pulled right up to it.  I ordered my old favorite... Classic Italian, and it was just as good as I remembered it to be!  The guys working the counter were so polite and friendly, that alone will keep me coming back.  I hope this location succeeds, I know I will definitely be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"The ladies working here were lovely. They made me a mean turkey sandwich. It's an airport so the prices are high but other than the price which was expected... this place has great service."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Quiznos; I preferred their bread and their sauces and the general overall package you can receive here over any other chain sandwich shop. However, I'm still very unsure about returning to this location.  There is an employee who works here who always seems to be the one who is waiting on me, which is not something I'm too fond about. Granted, he's let me in early a few times before they open, but that's about as far as my appreciation extends. On one specific occasion, he was being very forward about me trying the wheat bread. I politely declined and reaffirmed my decision on white. He then said I should probably eat the smaller sandwich instead of getting the medium size, which I also declined. I was heading to work and needed a good sized portion. I am a vegetarian and normally get just cheese and vegetables, nothing special, nothing too expensive. So it was a very big surprise when he rung up my order and it came to seven dollars without the drink. I know Quiznos is more expensive, but I've been here plenty of times to know that was wrong. The best part about it all is that after I reluctantly handed over my card (after he insisted they should always charge for 'extra cheese' and guacamole I hadn't even asked for), I looked down and realized he made me the very small four-inch sandwich when I'd asked for the bigger one. Perhaps an insult on my small frame, perhaps not- but that's the way any woman would take it.  At this point, I was very frustrated and simply left. I had promised myself I wouldn't go back, but weeks later, I found myself back in the store, face to face with the same man. I noticed the owner (presumably) was also there with him. She made my sandwich and dressed it to perfection, and there I was again with him as my cashier. He goes on about how it will be an extra cheese charge, and tries to charge me for a six dollar sandwich I hadn't asked for. But luckily, the owner came to my rescue and fixed his errors, saying specifically that she knew what the order should be because she had made it. He then had the audacity to say, \"When we make mistakes, we pay for it.\" after she left.  So beware consumers, if you walk into Quiznos and see this man, be firm in your demands. Don't let him upcharge you (as I've noted with most customers I've watched pay-- always much more than the advertised prices, or an 'extra charge' they hadn't known about-- he's even done it to firefighters). The saving grace and the reason behind my three stars was the immense professionalism of the owner, and specifically one of the women who works as a manager there oftentimes during the week."}
{"text":"As far as a Quizno's goes this one is clean and the owner is very friendly.  I'm in here a lot since it's close to work and enjoy the food.  Gets busy around noon but the line moves pretty fast"}
{"text":"Best Quiznos ever! Chris and Christine are the 2 nicest managers of any restaurant I have ever been too. They are there every Thursday and know what we like and greet us with a smile. Quiznos has great food for the price, but I go to this place for the service, outstanding. Thanks Chris and Christine!"}
{"text":"This was a Quizno's @ the McCarren International airport in Las Vegas. Extremely nasty place...I could not even eat half of my sandwich. Everything was falling out of it. Also, they didn't have everything on the menu that Quiznos usually has to offer. Waste of money and stomach space for food!!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this location. The staff is very friendly and always remember what I order! the food is always fresh and delicious. I also appreciate the cleanliness of the restaurant. I would give re staff at this location a raise. They ALWAYS go above and beyond every time I come in for lunch."}
{"text":"As of Feb 2014, all prices at this airport location have gone up by at least 30% across the board. $11 for a dinky 7.5 inch Quiznos sub? No thanks. Very disappointing!  I used to always grab a chili and a sandwich from here for non meal service flights, but I refuse to support the new price gouging going on here. There's even a new handwritten sign above the soda fountain that reads \"Refills are 85 cents\". Come on, man!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I like Quizno's- I like their how their sandwiches are warm and the soup is always good. The chip selection could be better, but that is something that I could work around. I love how they have a pickle \"bar\" that you can snack on pickles with your meal! I happen to really like pickles so this concept is great to me. I went to this Quizno's today and for the second time in a row (I went there a couple of weeks ago) the service was just bad. I specifically ask for no tomatoes when I order my sandwich. . I don't know if the \"front\" people are not talking to the \"back\" people but come on they are 5 feet away from one another.  I don't like tomatoes on a sandwich! The girl really started picking the tomatoes off my sandwich like she was irritated that I didn't want tomatoes. Then put my sandwich in the bag. Not only did this happen on this visit it happened last time as well. Is this Quizno's really in that bad of shape that they cannot make me a new sandwich?  The service at this Quizno's will prevent me from going back I will either go someplace else to eat or I will drive the extra five miles to a different Quizno's that will value me as a customer. So today  before I can eat my sandwich I have to pick the remaining tomatoes out as there is still \"slime\" and \"seeds\" that cannot be removed... Good thing I am not allergic to tomatoes... that would not be good!"}
{"text":"The reason this is the first review of this Quiznos is because it's Quiznos. Pretty consistent quality sandwich shop...toasted subs and junk. Honestly the sponge monkeys give the best Quiznos review so I'll leave it to them.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PdsS01iUZs"}
{"text":"Went in there today and it was absolutely disgusting. I knew I shouldn't have ordered anything but my mother wanted to grab a sandwich from here. My stomach hurts sooooo bad and it's the only thing I've eaten all day so I know for sure it was the sandwich. I ordered the angus steak, my mother the prime rib and my cousin the honey mustard chicken. We all have upset stomachs and we didn't much enjoy our sandwiches but 3 sandwiches came out to almost $40 so we ate them. I didn't enjoy it, and will never eat here again. I miss the location on Craig and Losee but now it's a Starbucks"}
{"text":"A fine place to go when in a hurry but it is just a hair better than subway. The turkey and guacamole is pretty good and the condiment bar a plus. Try the Thai place next store if you are in the mood for a little more unique experience."}
{"text":"Today I tried Quiznos basil pesto Turkey. It was fantastic. I love when a sandwich shop offers pesto. The staff was friendly with my kids who  ordered the kids meal. Combos are just two dollars here. Fantastic. Looks like they offer catering as well. Great clean store. Toasty!"}
{"text":"And they've officially shut down, not surprised at all this place was terribly run."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Employees didn't know how to use the credit card machine and I didn't have cash, so I left empty handed."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I am shocked and appalled at the terrible service that I received at this location. I tried to redeem for the free sub from the app offer, and was told to buy one to get the offer. The app couldn't pull up the offer code due to some glitch, so I purchased 1 sub and left only to find that it had NO toppings and was burnt black."}
{"text":"Not to much Quiznos around anymore :( I had a Dr apt today & I just had to stop by and grab my favorite sandwich since I was around the area. Not only was the service phenomenal , but the sandwich they made was still the best!!!"}
{"text":"This store was clean but the people working here don't speak. They just stand and stare off into space. No welcome or Hello. No what would u like? I do believe he asked me what kind of bread and followed up with a price. Hmmm how do they run a store with stuck up staff?  I wont return. I will however send the husband if I want a sub. I got a turkey and ranch it was just ok. I could have done better by making myself one at home. They were selfish with the meat and over friendly with the veggies matter of fact it looked like a veggie sandwich. I am not a rabbit I eat meat thank you."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was TERRIBLE! I love Quiznos but if they hire people like this, I'd rather boycott and go to Subway. They acted irritated when I asked for guacamole and a lady infront of me got a BLT but didn't want the lettuce or tomato, odd for sure, but the cashier said \"wait you don't want lettuce or tomato on your BLT? Then what's the point\" and rolled her eyes.. She was dead serious. Excuse me, we are the customers. Not you. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Over the last few months, I've been trying to find healthier choices when we go out to lunch with the gang.  With so much processed food, in fast food, it's pretty much a losing battle. However, Quiznos has recently introduced their smaller menu of 4\" sandwiches (photo). So you can now get, a surprisingly good meal for under 450 calories. See attached nutrition chart.   I was surprised and instantly became a fan.  It's basically their 8\" sandwich cut in half. D'oh why didn't I think of that!  Well most people who start off dieting just eat half, and take the rest home. The trick is not to eat it later I found. LOL  Quiznos has nice variety of different bread, and the toasting is a nice change from the same old, same old.  So, if UR like me.  And you UR looking for something lighter, I would give their 4\" menu a try.  Now, if I could just cut back on the Soda."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best.  Skimpy on the fillings and additions.  But the thing that pissed me off is that they charged me full retail price for my drinks and chips when I ordered the sandwiches as \"combos\".  They have signage all over the place stating \"make it a combo for only $2 more!\".  I didn't notice the overcharge until I got home.  IMO this is just a strategy by the franchise ownership to overcharge you and see if you notice and say something.  Pretty crappy way to do business IMO."}
{"text":"Love this location. I eat here all the time and the staff is always so friendly and quick. Every time I've ordered, the food has been fresh and tasty. Kind of random but the bathrooms are also super clean."}
{"text":"This place has definitely turned it around. I've come here before and have had to wait after I had already called my order in. My order is the same every time. I always get 2 chicken carbonara sandwiches. This time around my order was ready right away. The 2 ladies that helped me were friendly and inviting. I even got a 10% discount for living in the area. I will definitely be back. Oh and my 3 year old daughter demolished her own sandwich."}
{"text":"I would suggest going a minute down the street to Shorty's or Lunch Break before I ever suggest someone go to this chain.   Horrible service. The staff does not care to ask you much besides what kind of sandwich you want. They don't ask about your bread choice, or condiments at all. They also fail to ask if you want to add LETTUCE or any other vegetable topping! They literally let my sandwich back up in the toaster until in was burnt, then proceeded to wrap it up without asking if I wanted any vegetables, condiments, etc...   As if that was not bad enough, they set my cup for my drink on the OPPOSITE side of the counter from me. Seeing me struggle to reach for it, the cashier just walked away... No regard for customer service or actually making the effort to HAND me the cup. But to top it all off- I got the honey mustard chicken... Spit most of it out. No one wants to eat undercooked RUBBERY chicken! They just slopped it all together to pile everyone through.   Would not go back here."}
{"text":"80 degrees inside. No iced tea. Not willing to put the makings of a Chicken Carbonara on flatbread. The Classic Italian had more lettuce than actual meat and cheese. These are like the third set of owners in just a couple of years. Will not be returning due to the total lack of service."}
{"text":"Post Quiznos bankruptcy, it is very difficult to find a location that is still in operation.  This Mesa location is pretty hard to beat when it comes to total dining experience.  I will drive way out of my way to come to this location simply because I always leave happy.  I won't comment on the food, because it is standard Quiznos fair done well.  I journey to this location because of the people that work here.  The franchise owners love their store and love what they do.  They are present, and they actually deliver service with a smile which is very rare in today's retail environment.  The store is spotless and well appointed which leaves you with nothing to worry about except what types of peppers and sauce to enhance your sandwich.  So far I have not found another restaurant in Mesa that delivers like these people do."}
{"text":"Q: How many people and how many minutes does it take to make a \"toasty\" sub? A: At Quiznos?  A LOT.  The food is decent, especially the tuna melt, and $5 for a large is a great deal.  But this place is SO incredibly slow, every time I go there I swear it's the last time.  Alas, living across the street from it I have caved and gone back a few times...  But seriously, don't come here if you've got groceries in the trunk, kids waiting in the car, or anywhere you need to be in the next hour.    Also: I can't stand the oregano powder crap they dump on every sub.  Come on, Quiznos, there's gotta be a better-tasting distinctive touch.  I always tell them to leave this stuff off, and half the time they put it on anyway.   FYI - once the sandwich is out of the toasting machine, toppings are available by request only.  No one's gonna ask what you want on it like at Subway.  You really have to speak up if you want onions, olives, or whatever else they've got hiding back there.  Please God grant me the willpower to stop coming back to this Quiznos!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quiznos has had a rough time the last couple of years.   But this location seems unaffected by the problems at corporate and a soft economy which closed one of their stores on nearby Scottsdale Road.  If you are unfamiliar with Quiznos, they make some good toasted sub sandwiches, prepared with better quality meats, cheeses and bread. Yes you'll pay a little extra, in my case $7.19 for a large Turkey Club, but generally they're very good..   Another positive are the folks who work here, seem happy and eager. I have always found that as a good gage on how the employees are treated and if they enjoy coming to work.  So Three Stars, \"A-OK\".  As I mentioned in my Tip, consider joining their eClub for a $2.00 Off coupon and other promotional emails before coming here."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sandwich was messed up and they did not give me a water cup. I would suggest not going to this quiznos for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Tried Quizno's for the first time with my sister and three kids.  No one liked it.  It was as bad (if not worse) than Subway.  Who considers this stuff food?  Or a sandwich?"}
{"text":"This place is a sad excuse for a place to eat. Because everyone is forced to choose to eat here or at a few other over priced eateries at the airport, the customer service doesn't have to be up to par. I mean I wasn't expecting much especially for an 11$ sandwich. I'm so used to eating at subway where u get a whole footlong for 8-9$. Instead here u get an 8 inch. Plus there is NO- Make it your way. All is preset.  We ordered the Italian on Parmesan bread. Combo of what I would similarly order at subway aka the BMT.  When we got our sandwich, the bread was all burnt(see picture), there was way too much Italian dressing so the bread was all soggy and as we ate it, it was dripping a combo of the dressing/oil from the oily/fatty meats all down my arm. I mean I don't blame them for bad customer service, why provide good service if you don't have to?? Most places to eat at the airport have a monopoly so yea.  Not bad, not good. Hard to compare when all you have else to eat is cookies, ice cream and Baha fresh express."}
{"text":"Great place and an extremely friendly staff. Made me the wrong size sub one time, and offered to remake it and let me keep the one they messed up on.  Top notch place to grab something quick for a lunch break, go for the Honey Bacon Club or Tuna! My favorites!"}
{"text":"This is the first time that we have been to this establishment while living in Phoenix.. I really had a taste for Quiznos and they did not disappoint. Very very friendly employees and my sandwich was made quickly and correctly. Will be going back again thank you"}
{"text":"I used to love Quiznos.... I would go out of my way to get a turkey bacon guacamole sandwich any day. At this point in my life I will no long be giving any money to this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop. The staff is rude and careless. I was given obviously bad guacamole... Which I didn't realize until i got home a took a bite of my sandwich to have the fowl taste in my mouth. It took 20 mins to get my sandwich, there was only one couple in front me. I'm done with this place. I should have went to paradise bakery across the street."}
{"text":"Awful!!! Prices are more than normal Quiznos and taste awful. No where near the taste of a normal Quiznos. Do NOT go here."}
{"text":"I purchased an online coupon for Quiznos by mistake, thinking it was for another sub shop located a couple minutes from my house.  It turns out this location is the closest, but further away than I'd usually be willing to travel for a sub.  However, since I now had the coupon I thought it a good opportunity to try my first ever Quiznos sub.  So I went to Yelp to read reviews for this and other locations.  I was having friends stop by to swim in my pool this past Sunday afternoon (2014.0727), so decided I'd go pick-up a couple subs.  Before I did I checked their hours on both their corporate and Yelp's sites; both said it was open Sunday from 11:00 am - 8:00 pm, and Yelp even had \"Open now\" in green letters to the right of their Sunday hours.  I arrived at their front door at 3:20 pm and the place was closed with a note taped on their door \"Open 11:00 am - 3:00 pm.\"  Thus a 45-minute round-trip wasted.  I'd love to provide my feedback about their food, but to-date I've never had any.  What I can comment on is this location and their corporation.  Once back home I rechecked both Quiznos Corporate and Yelp's sites, and again they both indicated this location should have been open at this time.  Not very pleased with this waste of time, I decided that rather than give this location a bad review on Yelp, I'd simply provide feedback direct to Quiznos Corporate, so I clicked on their \"Contact\" link at the bottom, which presented another page for a few seconds than immediately returned to their opening page.  I tried this several times using two different browsers, and then tried using a different computer, but all with the same result.  Frustrated, I searched for Quiznos Corporate contact info.  What I discovered from various links was even more disturbing.  Not only did I find a plethora of complaints from very dissatisfied customers on their own site (www.corporateofficehq.com/quiznos-corporate-office/), I found many other sites with negative customer feedback.  No wonder they don't want any more contact from their website.  Then I learned that Quiznos Corporate filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2014 \"due to a rash of (store) closings nationwide.\"  It appears this company has problems from top to bottom.  I'm going to attempt to use my coupon (which I already paid for) before they go belly-up."}
{"text":"I go to this quiznos quite a lot cause its the only thing close to my work. the food isn't bad but the place is disgusting. It smells like sewage. Not all the time but most of the time. The worst thing by far is the Soda fountain. It tastes like dirt. the soda line might be dirty or they are just using crap water. I don't know. They are always out of stuff. The rags they wipe the knives on are dingy. The girls are pretty nice to me but they seem to really not want to be there. When i mentioned how bad the soda in the fountain was they always just shrug. No body tries to rectify this situation. I don't know who owns this place but please clean the place up and fix the soda!!! I really hope they open something up that i can walk to.. Ewwwww"}
{"text":"I ordered online and went to go pick it up. When I got there at the time it was scheduled to be done, 3 lady's gave me attitude and told me they just got the order. When I got home and started eating, they made all 3 of the sandwiches wrong. I love Quiznos but this was by far the worst experience I've had. Stay away from this location!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, poor business practices!  Be AWARE when using coupons, even theirs, and ordering a \"meal\" they do not give you the \"meal\" pricing.  This devalues the coupon.  The fact they are not upfront about this is deceptive.  My Quiznos calendar is in the trash!"}
{"text":"This business is now closed for business.  The only 2 open in vegas are on Durango and centennial, and Charleston and jones I think.  Super bummer I need to drive across town to get my quiznos especially since there is no togos in town."}
{"text":"This place sucked, was great, then sucked again. Finally it is out of business and can quit playing with my emotions."}
{"text":"My friends and I all got food poisoning after eating here. One threw up and the other is at the hospital right now. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I have lived near this location for about 9 years.  I've never been wild about any sub shop, but if the mood struck, I'd stop in.  Today I stopped in and I was severely disappointed.   The staff was unfriendly, they looked bored and acted like the customers were a nuisance.  When I placed my order, the young man rolled his eyes then sighed and asked what bread I wanted.  Now, I ordered the \"California Chicken Club\", it's just one of the standard menu items.  The questions he asked were perplexing.  \"Do you want chicken on it?\" \"Do you not want to add ranch?\"  So, I finally said, \"I want it just like it says on the menu.\"  He said ok.  Evidently, I wasn't done torturing myself (or them) so I asked them to toast it a little extra.  You'd have thought I asked them to start a fire in the middle of the restaurant!  THREE staff members set out to tell me how crazy it was to toast it longer.  I said, ok, nevermind.  (Geesh.. heaven forbid a customer ask for what she wants, eh?)  So, my \"toasted\" sandwich comes out of the oven and they asked what I want on it for toppings.  I asked for tomatoes and guacamole.  So, my personal chef sets out to educate me on how I need to add lettuce, onion, olives.. oh and guac is $1 more.  I said, \"No, it comes with guac, there shouldn't be an upcharge for it\", but I am informed that the menu shouldn't really say that, and I'll indeed have to pay extra if I want it.  Well, by this time I'm fed up (and still hungry) so I put my little southern foot down and insist the menu be honored, no matter what my \"sandwich architect\" says.  The lady on the cash register says it's ok, she'll just \"give\" me the guacamole this time to be nice.  So, I pay and take my contra-ban.. i mean, guacamole sandwich, and high-tail it out of there.  I wasn't the only person getting a hard time.  I overheard them starting the same line with the lady in line behind me.    Suggestion:  Skip this place and go two doors down to Domino's.  I've never had to argue with anyone there and they have better subs any way!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. I've enjoyed every visit that I've made. The restaurant never seems busy which is a shame. The owners are very personable and sweet people. They carry a genuine conversation with us when we come in and ask about our day. When I take my daughter with me they insist on throwing in a free cookie or some kind of treat. The food is always good. I favor the Classic Italian and my daughter likes the Black Angus Steak. We will definitely continue to go to this location as long as the current owners stay."}
{"text":"The hot food his the spot on really cold day!  I was drawn in by $.99 soup offer. So the chili was a great choice.   Decent amount of ground beef and beans, well seasoned just a bit of a bite.   The cup of soup is a little steep at $ 1.79 for about 4-5 oz size.   The black Angus steak sandwich is well flavored abd cheese had nice Brown taste to it!  Fresh bread helps too.   The portions are a little small for the price.     The service was really quick. Everything was the way it should have been.   Both employees worked to get a like of people in and out.  This is a good dip but you really want to use a coupon to make it a deal."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of quiznos and always get the same thing every single time... regular size classic club, medium pop, and a cookie :) I love the fact that you can watch them make your food, and they're fast, attentive and nice! I also liked the fact that they had tables and chairs outside, so i didn't have to leave my dog in the truck and she got to come sit outside with us. Too bad this quiznos is far from our house, but if it was closer I'd come here more often..."}
{"text":"I've been going here for awhile. There is usually a gentleman in the shop. Very nice, wonderful personality, and keeps the place clean. After I'm done doing my homework or reading the paper I get something to go.  Recently two ladies are working the shop. One younger and one older. Every time I'm come to the shop they just stand around and watch me. They are very rude and unprofessional. The younger one told me I can't stay if I'm not going to be anything as soon as I come in. Ever since these two ladies have came in this place has been filthy. There is old food underneath the oven. Finger prints over everything and the tables are always dirty. The bathrooms are ridiculous. I will not return here ever. The health inspector needs to pay them a visit. The deserve 0 stars"}
{"text":"Ordered food online. They failed to deliver 1 of the 5 combos we ordered. They use grubhub for orders and told us we had to take it up with grubhub and offered no resolution. It also took them 30 minutes longer to deliver than promised. Terrible service."}
{"text":"The only reason this gets two stars is because of the two girls working the end of the sandwich bar today.. I ordered a Baha chic sandwich and that was fine then I ordered two flatbreads with balsamic vinaigrette and NO cheese I must have repeated it three times to the girl making sandwiches because she seemed tuned out making a cater order I get it your busy. Then they come out of the other side with cheese so I tell them that I didn't want cheese the girls at the end of the counter apologized and asked the order maker at the other end to remake them with no cheese then this is where things go bad.. The girl looks over at them and says just pick off the cheese now I'm not a genius but I know that you can't pick off melted cheese.. I'm assuming she was a manager of some sorts and she was wearing a sweater and the other two girls are wearing their uniforms so I asked the girl on the sweater to please remake them because the person I was getting it for has a cheese allergy so with an attitude and not even apologizing to me she goes back to remake them and tells the people that are waiting behind me that she can't make their sandwiches yet because I need new ones.. Rude rude rude I apologized and the two girls at the end of the counter were amazing they made my order right.. Needless to say the new sandwiches that I got didn't look so great there was hardly any sauce on them and she sped them through the oven so it wasn't really toasted.. To the two girls at the end of the counter hats off to you you guys did a great job but to the order taker that was there today at about 1030 I've never had someone be so rude about a mistake that you made not me.. I was polite about it but the attitude I received was horrible.."}
{"text":"So about a week ago I go into this Quiznos please do not get me wrong I love Quiznos to dealth and still do!  This one used to be one of the good ones but last wed I went in for my choose two veggie flatbread and salad no chicken after my hubby wanting a flat bread and them telling him no I still wanted mine so I order to find out they no longer do a veggie flat bread I know things change and cost money but I tried to explain all I wanted was lettus tom and sauce on my flat bread no cheese no quac ect they wanted me to pay 5 bucks for that when I could get a chicken one with cheese for 3?  Makes no sense sorry guys you were the best I was driving 45 mins just to get your Quiznos but after refusing to make our sand witches and wanting to charge me 5 dollars for a flatbread with vinegarette and lettus and tomatoes. No thanks!!! Wish you would make your customers number 1 we used to go to your store 2 times a week"}
{"text":"So, I don't like to be negative with reviews but this is more of a heads up to future customers (and management).  A coworker and myself came here for lunch (to go), we were the only customers there at that time. The lady making the sandwiches was extremely nice BUT there was difficulty with communication between us (English is not her first language). We were able to make it through and customers started to fill for their lunch and she appeared to be the only one available. When our sandwiches were coming out the oven another Quiznos worker comes through and starts to ring us up, he had difficulty with the coupon code we had and had to call his manager, at this point there are about 8 people in the store (not a big store) and the average time they are MAKING a sandwich is about 10 minutes (if you are 3rd in line, your lunch is shot). Luckily the manager was able to navigate him over the phone, then we gave him our cash and as he opens the cash register the drawer is empty. He ask his coworker about the drawer and she says \"in the back\", he went in the back to get the money and gave us our change. Our overall time was approximately 30 minutes for two regular sandwiches and no special order. The point I'm trying to make is staff should have a little more pep in their step (especially dealing with people's food during time sensitive matters), they need to make sure there drawers have enough money to give out change, and make sure customers can communicate with staff on tyre front line. I will give them credit for not being mean or disrespectful."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Quizno's for lunch, not because I love Quizno's, but because I had a gift card.  I remembered why I don't love it.  The service was slow and not especially friendly, and the food is barely \"ok\".  I had the \"choose 2 combo\" with the Turkey Pesto Bullet (I think? it's the smaller sandwhich thing) and the tomato basil soup.  The Turkey Pesto was mostly bread, which was falling apart.  The soup was bland, even after the 2 packets of salt and pepper I dumped in.  The only thing I really like about Quizno's - the pepper bar - I love jalapenos and hot peppers and I love that I can serve myself and put as much or as little as I want on.  Other than that, I really don't see what all the hype is about Quizno's and how they're able to open up shop what seems like on every corner of the Valley?  Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things.  Oh well."}
{"text":"This Quiznos is one of a kind. It seems to be a family owned and if so it's good to see the owners behind the counter working along with the staff actually making the sandwiches.    I've never had a bad experience.  My sandwiches are always good and because they seem to have a better selection of sauce they put on them and their chicken doesn't taste processed I'm more willing to step outside my box and try other sandwich selections.  The Caesar salad is amazing too.  It could stand up in a taste test next to one prepared by a fancy smancy restaurant any day!  When checking out they're always eager to give you coupons for savings on your next visit.  Definitely recommend this Quiznos if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Quiznos location. They offer most of the same items as others and accept all of the popular coupons. The servers have always been quite friendly, and are apologetic if they make a mistake.  However, I do have some issues:  1) The containers they provide for the dipping sauces are laughably small. Most locations offer these wide black containers that make dipping the sub easy and comfortable. This location only offers the take-out sized containers, which are the size of a thimble. If I want to get some sauce with a to-go sub, I have to fill like 3 or 4 of the containers and pour them into something wider when I get home.  2) This location only has the Honey Mustard dip. Many other locations have 3 or 4 different dipping sauces, as well as a fancy assortment of other options like spicy peppers and other condiments. Also, at least half of the time, they don't even leave the honey mustard dip for customers to dispense themselves! When I ask for it, the cashier hands me 1 or 2 pre-filled thimble-sized containers.  These may seem like small gripes, but one of the big reasons I would choose Quiznos over Subway are the dipping sauce, and to me this is bit of an issue."}
{"text":"Their subs are pretty good but Don't go here for soup in a bread bowl. They are always out. They must only have a handful every day...in the middle of fall when everyone wants soup. Get on it Quiznos."}
{"text":"If I could give less stars I would. I ordered food thru Postmates never received my food. Tried calling so I can pick up the food I ordered and was charged for never got an answer. Can't believe someone would do business with such a shady company that literally couldn't deliver on their end. Love being bent over and taken advantage of that was 5 stars!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"** not closed ** While I despise most chain sammie spots, when you've been hosed by your regular deli a few times (City Centre Cafe) sometimes change is good. After a quick comparison, this Quiznos actually provides better salads, sammies and soups over CCC (sad really). Supporting local biz? Good. Eating sub par deli food? Bad. Provided you ignore the pre-sliced meat that comes in a bag, the 'wiches here aren't the worst. Customize it the way you want, watch it get all toasted and you're golden. The reason for the low(er) star rating is bc little things like the iced tea and soups are typically empty or running out and never refilled. Also, the hours are funky and they're closed on weekends."}
{"text":"Since we no longer have Quizno's in Greenville, SC it is always pleasant to stop by this Quizno's when I'm visiting friends in Charlotte, NC.  The staff are on point and go out of their way to engage with the patrons and they make a great sub.    I dearly wish we still had a Quizno's in Greenville, SC, but it's nice to know this one is still an option when I have occasion to visit Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Good place to grubb for lunch"}
{"text":"Went there about 4 years ago wasn't impressed then so tried them again today. Not very friendly and I guess they have no problem running food there because for a 7 dollar sandwich very skimpy toppings Bread was fresh though. Store itself was very dirty ! Won't be be going back sorry to say. They should be making customers feel invited when they enter , a proper helping and have a clean store. Maybe they need new management?"}
{"text":"I love Quiznos, but they are all gone where I live.  This was an absolute excellent surprise.  I've never had a bad sandwich.  I love the carbonara, the Angus steak and the honey bacon!"}
{"text":"First of all, this is the ONLY location that's close by!!! This wasn't my first time. I've never been so insulted, or felt UN-WELCOMED EVER! I won't be back again. The only reason we gave this location two tries was, I had to use my $16 Groupon!!  I should of known from the start the staff was HORRIBLE. I was the one who was trying to be polite. I agree with Emily's review completely. They couldn't be bothered to fake a smile! I wish I grabbed this young kid's name working tonight.  FIRST of all, I picked up a meatball marinara COMBO. He was rude to my Mother at check out. Then when we ate, I was going to give a simple yelp review for like 3 stars. The food was GOOD but the people working tonight were miserable. You can see it on their faces. My mother had opened her bag of ruffles & told me to try them. I liked those more than the Sun chips. I put the sun chips back, the female employee was right there. She watched me switch them out.  We're about to leave, as I grab a refill. The young guy behind the counter's like \"You gotta pay for that!!\". I came back in, told him \"What are you talking about? I just switched the bags, I hadn't opened it.\" He said \"Oh our regular costumers come in and open bags & grab new ones.\" Well it was just really insulting to me, he doesn't know me.  I know granted I was wearing casual clothing, but I DO NOT steal. SIMPLE.  He really pissed me off. No apology, fine I'll take my money to Firehouse Subs.  I hope they're happy that they drive business away. I walked in there at quarter of 6 & the place was EMPTY, as if that wasn't a big enough red flag.  I won't be shocked if they're closed in a few months."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Fast service.  Clean restaurant.  My primary complaint is that the thermostat was set to hold at 65 degrees.  Seriously?  It's freezing in here!  Bring your hand warmers."}
{"text":"The owner of this shop went out of his way to accommodate us in the morning during a St. Patrick's Day festival. Subs were on point and the restaurant was squeaky clean as well. Definitely a good choice!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the past few months, and have generally been impressed by the quality of the food and service. However, on my most recent trip, my experience left a bit to be desired. The teenager making my sandwich ignored my request to leave the onions off of my sandwich (or couldn't hear my response over the loud music, and didn't confirm), and when I took it back up to get it remade without onions, they simply picked the onions out and put it on a new sub roll (and of course missed some in the process). In my many years eating at Quiznos, I have come to expect better service than that, and I will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"The 3 star rating this location currently has is pretty accurate. My rating comes in at a 2.5, but I don't want to give it 2 stars because what I ate wasn't necessarily bad, just disappointing. I got a classic Italian on wheat, with mayo instead of vinaigrette, and added jalape√±os and green pepper. The meat to bread ratio was NOT favorable.  The bread was sliced unevenly, so the bottom half was super thin while the top half was thicker. There was so much meat it did not fit in the bread. It was much more difficult to eat than your average hoagie. It also disappointed severely in the flavor department. The meat was pretty bland. If you're like me, and your go-to is an Italian, you know what I mean. When the meat is low quality and doesn't really taste like anything. They were pretty busy, and I waited about 10 minutes for my hoagie. Definitely prefer Subway, always more options and better quality. This airport has a lot of options, I'd recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Classic Italian was a good sub, but nothing to take your breath away. I know that you can get a hot sub at a lot of places but whatever kind of over they use to heat their subs here is better then most.   There is a nice little pickle and pepper stand which is convenient and you can get as many pepperoncini's as you can handle.  Overall it was average food, price, and service."}
{"text":"Recently, I was stuck in the Charlotte, NC airport for a layover and decided to grab a quick breakfast. I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito, but Salsaritas had not opened yet... and the line at Burger King was massive... so, I decided to give Quizno's breakfast a try. Boy, I'm glad that I did b/c the brekky sandwich I ordered was yummy! I had the sausage, egg, and cheddar on flatbread, and it was very tasty. I like my breakfast sandwiches made more like a lunch sandwich, with lettuce, tomato, and deli mustard, and they made it right up for me. The bread was soft (but toasted) and warm (just right IMHO), and the sausage was very flavorful, which was a pleasant surprise. Plus the portion size of the sammy was just right for breakfast  (and not too small like the breakfast ones from some other fast food chains). I don't know if all the Quizno's stores have breakfast, but I'll be sure to research this the next time I'm traveling or run across a Quizno's here in NYC while out and about in the early morning.  One other thing I should mention about this particular Quizno's location is the amazing customer service. Both the cashier and the sandwich maker were super nice!"}
{"text":"This Quizno's was a bright spot in an otherwise long day. They serve a tremendous classic Italian sub. Its loaded with a perfect blend of tangy meats and fresh veggies. Always get it on the cheese bread.   Quiznos quality varies a lot from store to store. I'll return to this one. The shop at the Denver airport is great too.  My health kick continues. At least I didn't take a pint-of-Hagen-Dazs sleeping pill like last week."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick meal before boarding to leave Vegas.  They have a tuna sub, which I appreciated since I don't eat meat, only seafood.  Service was quick, they got my order right.  Downgrade one star is for inflated airport prices.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My medium Lobster and Seafood sub had two (2) heaping ice cream scoops of flavourful seafood (in your FACE McLobster!).  For $8, it is well worth the price.  i must have had a couple dozen of these things this summer alone. Actually, it also comes as a salad, and I have had a few of those when I didn't want the extra carbs.  I give this product a 4, which really makes the McLousy I had worth less than a 1.  Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Landed in CLT for a short layover. It was about 6am when I got here and I was happy to see Quiznos was open. The menu was limited compared to a standard Quiznos but the food was just as good."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times since my visit last summer when the AC was on the fritz. As all good Yelpers do, I am updating my review, as the rating for this Quizno's location has changed. I arrived before the typical \"lunch hour\" and was pleased to find no line. It was prompt, friendly service at it's finest. The Baja Chicken was as good as ever and the AC was chillin'. I got it to go and was very pleased to find it traveled well. As long as the AC is working, this place is hard to beat for a quick tasty sandwich. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch there yesterday and craved the same sandwich just 2 hours later. The peppercorn steak on white was amazing as usual along with my chicken bacon salad. As we sat and ate we both agreed it was by far, better than a Subway sandwich and it was all about the bread! The gals there were very attentive and sweet, great customer service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 2 times, both times have sucked.  The first time, like the others who have posted, I wasn't given the chance to add lettuce or anything else that wasn't apart of the \"recipe\".  So on my 2nd visit I made sure when I ordered my Baja sandwich to specify that I wanted lettuce and tomato added.   When the sandwich made it to the cash, it wasn't what I ordered at all. The Baja is a chicken sandwich, this was a beef sandwich. When I said something he shrugged and went to set it aside... But since there was a big line up and he was the only person working, I said I'd take it and try it anyways.  You'd think when you completely mess up an order you'd discount it or something... But no, was charged full price for a shitty sandwich, and he didn't even apologize. The name of these sandwiches isn't even similar. He repeated to me when I ordered what I had asked for... But then made something different. What the hell?!  I really like Quiznos, and it's frustrating that so many of the locations have closed... This was my only option really when I get a craving, but I won't come back."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the food is great, and the staff is always friendly. Would recommend Quiznos in general, this place as well."}
{"text":"Stopped by one night late, only one guy working, probably the manager/owner based on him being on the phone and looking like he wanted to gtfo dodge attitude and not wearing anything quiznos related like most workers do...   Food... subpar... it's a chain... it's hard to fuck up... but he did. There was no care in the making of the sub... I pretty much watched him throw it together, run it through the toaster tossed some lettuce on and wrap it up...  I had chips in my hand... wanted a meal... he didn't ask and just rang it up w/o the drink... I asked what size cup to grab and he said \"oh you wanted a drink?\"  Of course I wanted a fucking drink... I just stared at him like wtf man?  Told him to keep his drink cause he'd have to re run my card...    srsly it's a chain that gives you all the stuff and training to make a sandwich like the other 1000's of quiznos around the country... and you can't do it. If you hate customer service don't buy a franchise sandwich shop.  Two stars... lucky it isn't one. I'm out"}
{"text":"This Quiznos is A-OK to use yelp's own rubric.  Quiznos is Quiznos and while its not my favorite sandwich place, it will do in a pinch.  In this case, its near where I am regularly for work and its an easy walk if I want to flee the building for a few minutes to get some air and some lunch.  I've had a couple of sandwiches there, all of which were fine. Nothing to write home about, but decent toasty goodness. There's nothing particularly awful but also nothing that's likely to blow you away food wise.  Service is always good though, with friendly and helpful folks who make your sandwich to order and do so quickly and with a smile. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's just this location or any other Quiznos but today I came here for the new Mac and Cheese pasta bowl with seafood and lobster and I was highly disappointed. When you think of Mac and Cheese you would think it to be cheesy. It seemed like the only cheese I saw or tasted was cheese that they sprinkled on top. I was eating plain pasta that had seafood on top with sprinkled cheese, baked. This location is good but this product was highly highly disappointing. Now I'm wondering if they just forgot to make my pasta \"Mac and Cheese\"??? Hmm..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and tasty sandwich I went on a Saturday and it was kinda empty which is nice since it is near a couple of business parks so I can imagine lunch being packed. Love the raspberry lemonade that Quiznos offers and the condiment station is always a plus."}
{"text":"We always eat here when we go to the mall.  Love their honey mustard chicken sandwich. A soda and a cookie and you have lunch.  Yum! Always good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this store along with the couple that own it . They are always always pleasant and happy to feed people  I am never disappointed... Until one day I was sick and unable to drive to pick up my lunch so I order online for delivery . I ordered my sandwich at 11:38 , I didn't get my one sandwich until 12:30. Mind you I live two lights down from Quiznos . My sandwich was very cold and soggy. It was obvious my sandwich was sitting for a while before it was delivered. I will never order delivery again . Other than that I still love Quiznos!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this damn chain but I absolutely love it. I pay $10 for a sandwich but can't find anything to complain about.  The chicken carbonara is by far my favorite, however I do vary sometimes and get the turkey peppercorn parmasean.  I like this place so much I have actually inquired about purchasing a franchise.  I have never come across anyone who doesn' t enjoy a delicious toasty Quizno's sub sandwich.  In fact, I refuse to go anywhere else when it comes to fast food sandwichs."}
{"text":"Great service. Very clean. Workers always busy even when the store isn't busy. Cleaning, stocking, and taking care of business, So glad I stoped in. Enjoy tasty food, good service in a very clean environment!"}
{"text":"Out of products, AWFUL service, we walked out. Unorganized and VERY unprofessional attitude, poorly managed store- And dirty. We were the only customers- Waited almost 30 min and the sandwiches weren't even done. It's a little further of a drive but the Quiznos off of 95 and by tenaya/ Craig is AMAZING and I will never go to this one again."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here several times every time taking out the food.  This location is extremely clean and efficient.  I've never seen the place busy and I've typically been there around noon.  The food I've ordered has always been different consisting of multiple sandwiches.  The orders have always been correct, and the food nice a fresh.  Great location!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Quiznos Subs and was a bummed when so many locations closed. That being said I am glad this location is still around. They are always fast, friendly, and courteous. The only problem I had was the sandwich should have been cooked a little longer on the belt, it seemed a little soggy and would have been better if they didn't pull it out of the belt so early."}
{"text":"I used to come here and get either the medium Italian or the pizza sub. Both of which were pretty good but after finding out that there is a ton of sodium and calories in the italian, I usually get the smallest size now because the medium size is more for 2 meals. They used to have the green tabasco sauce there which went really well with the pizza sub but the last time I was in, they had a new hot sauce which was not as good."}
{"text":"** 3.5 Stars **  I don't think I need to explain much about what Quiznos is as I'm sure you all know. Great gourmet subs with all different types of toppings, meats, breads, etc toasted nicely and served tasting great.  Only problem is that it's really freakin expensive. A regular size sub combo-ed up will cost you just over $10!!   This place is clean and service is fast but refills for fountain drinks cost 70cents and they don't do delivery here.  Nonetheless a solid choice if you can't settle on anywhere else to go for lunch."}
{"text":"This quiznos is not good to go to. They are rude and the sandwich sucked...DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I had a mid-day flight to catch earlier and didn't leave myself much time to eat lunch before hand.  So as I was walking to my gate, I stopped by several food places to see what the offerings were.  Instead of making a lunch of Cinnabon, frozen yogurt, or trail mix, I went to Quizno's.  The line wasn't bad but the staff there was extremely flustered.    The guy that helped me asked me several times what I wanted and he clarified that they were out of romaine lettuce for the salads a few times.  I was fine with that; I actually like the shredded lettuce alternative; it's easier to eat!  Before it was my turn at the cash register, I noticed that the flustered employee admitted to putting the wrong cheese on another woman's salad and he had a conniption before throwing that one out and making a new one for her... he also forgot to prepare another customer's soup.  I thought this might just put him over the top, but he hung in there, at least to see me through the line!  The salad itself was edible, but not great... flustered guy did add olives, pepperocini, tomato, guacamole and egg per my request.  This was a good thing because the chicken in the salad was nasty... it tasted extremely processed and so did the guac although I ate that anyways.  I picked around chicken and used the honey mustard dressing for flavor.  The pita/lavosh that came with it wasn't bad.  Not the healthiest lunch, but it could've been much worse!  So there you have it, Quizno's at the airport is pretty average... If I return, I'll likely try just a veggie sandwich or maybe give their turkey a shot.  But in the meantime, I hope that Quizno's hires another employee or two - perhaps someone who's more calm and can help the flustered guy who served me today!"}
{"text":"The employees are rude.  No help. No reccomendations. The only reason they got 2 stars is because the food was ok."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I came to Scottsdale for work to see that there was a Quiznos near my house. I tried it for the first time tonight and it was amazing! The sandwich was delicious, and the cashier who helped me was very polite. During our conversation I found out that he was in high school and I believe his parents are the owners, and you really just don't see kids as nice as him anymore. He greeted me immediately, made a great sandwich, and thanked me for the business. Great experience, I will be back!"}
{"text":"*grumble grumble* is the sound my tummy was making before I ate. *grumble grumble* is the sound I'm making now because I'm displeased.  I ordered the broccoli cheese soup, a marshmallow treat (which was really all I wanted, but needed to get something lunch-ish to justify the delivery to myself) and a turkey sandwich.  The soup was watery *sigh*  The marshmallow treat was absent *boohoohoo*  The sandwich was ok, nothing earth shattering, not particularly toasty, but good enough for me to take 4 bites.   I ordered online and had it delivered (yes, I'm lazy, but I really just didn't feel like going out into the full-blown dusty, habooby monsoon). Instead of telling me they didn't have any marshmallow treats, they tried to bribe me with their chocolate chunk cookie and a brownie. I'm not a big fan of chocolate, so I don't consider either of those items an acceptable bribe for my silence. Also, if you don't have something I ordered, just tell me. I'm really easy to talk to. *pinky swear* You can call me, text me, or say it when you deliver it, but don't make it so that I have to discover the missing item for myself...that's lame.   Sorry guys, but your food is just too expensive (seriously, it's just a sandwich, stop feeling yourselves so much!) to walk away less than 100% happy...and stop adding water to cheese soup. That's gross and chintzy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite to eat before camping. Originally we were on our way to Port of Subs but I looked up my Entertainment Book coupons and saw I had a BOGO-ish coupon for here. So we decided to change gears (literally) and cross the highway.   When we went in there wasn't anyone waiting. The place is actually pretty small too. When I talked to the lady at the counter I showed her my coupon and asked if I could use it for a salad instead of a sub. Even though she had never seen the coupon before she was very accommodating. She also let me put lobster on the salad even though they were almost out of it.    Additionally, we had a small cooler we needed to fill up and they let us get ice from their machine. Thanks guys!  Overall service was great and food was decent. Still .. with the coupon we still spent $15 which seemed a bit high but I guess sub prices are on the rise."}
{"text":"In the end, the sub was relatively tasty, but the customer service (AND SANITATION RATING!) leaves a lot to be desired.  Ordered a veggie sub.  The manager asked me what vegetables I wanted.  I'd rad the list, which was posted in front of me, and asked for all of them, minus olives and bell peppers.  He rolled his eyes and said \"there are a lot of vegetables, are you sure?\"  Why yes, I am... he then asked me individually each vegetable to confirm I did in fact want them on my sandwich.  I paid for my meal with a $20. I asked if I could receive two $5s instead of a $10.  The cashier had two $5's in her hand, but Mr. Manager came over, told her that wasn't allowed, and made her give me a $10.  Nobody spoke to me, nobody apologized or said why that was the case, it was just done for me despite my polite request.  They have a 92.5 rating, by the way... I wish I'd noticed before I ordered!  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Quiznos just isn't the same. I'd still pick Quiznos over subway any day, just the quality has gone down over the years.   $5 subs after 5pm everyday!"}
{"text":"I have had a craving for Quiznos for quite sometime. Decided to stop in here and try this store out....Quiznos once again satisfied my lunch cravings! The worker was super polite and made my sandwich with all my customizations on point. Thank you Quiznos! Keep up the good work and please open up more locations!"}
{"text":"I payed my buddy a visit in the hospital and once I left, I was hungry and decided to hit up Quiznos. Very very good. Great customer service. Very friendly. Subs hit the spot. I've been here about 4 times since then... Best Sub in town!!! 5+ stars."}
{"text":"Can't get any better than this. I used to work for one that was the best in the city you want good food come here"}
{"text":"Man, lots of haterade for this place, but I certainly thought it was fine.  Bonus points for having outdoor seating (well, you're technically stealing seats from the place next door, but it still works).  A funny quirk - in Arizona, the #5 is called a \"California Club\".  In California, they call it \"Turkey Bacon Guacamole\""}
{"text":"Was craving a sandwich after work and decided to go to Quiznos. As I was walking up I noticed they were mopping the floors so I looked at what time they close and the door said 9:00pm. It was 8:35 when I walked in. I opened the door and the fountain drinks were blocked off and there was a mop blocking the registers, so I asked if they were all shut down and the lady up front just said \"yes.\" No explanations or apologies. I've been working in the food industry for 6 years now and know that when you're working in a restaurant of any type you're not suppose to 1.) deny service to any guests (especially when you're not closed) 2.) shut EVERYTHING down before closing time. I walked out and went to Sonic across the street to get a sandwich and was highly satisfied with THEIR service and food. Will never be returning to this Quiznos again."}
{"text":"I only go to this Quiznos when I'm craving the brocalie soup since its the best! But I'm so annoyed at the rest of the food quality and the price for what you get! A small chicken sandwhich and med. soup cost me $9.80! Now, if it was actual chicken and not processed chicken pieces and real bacon and not freeze dried out bacon I probably wouldnt complain but with the quality of ingrediants I dont understand how you can charge such high prices. I think this place and company overall would do much much better if they would just improve quality of food they serve. This place doesnt even use real napkins anymore they use restroom like brown papertowls! I'm sure they are one processed chicken sandwhich away from shutting down like most others have."}
{"text":"Apparently it is rocket science on making a sandwich.  I placed an order through UberEats. Which driver picked up and delivered to me quickly. No complaints there  My order consisted of a 4 inch chipotle turkey on wheat.  In special instructions I put: No tomato No onion Extra lettuce Add pickles Add pepperchinis Add mustard  What I got: No tomato No onion No sauce that comes normally with the sandwich No mustard Tiny amount of turkey Tiny amount of cheese No lettuce Pickles Pepperchinis   Can someone tell me how you got the first two things on my request list and last 2 items correct. But somehow bypassed the middle request and apparent knowledge of the standard sauce that is supposed to go on this sandwich?  This is the 2nd time this has happened. First time I thought it was a fluke. This 2nd time just ticks me off. I got it delivered because I didn't have time to leave the office. I don't understand why I am basically being punished for not going there and watching someone make the sandwich. I don't get why it is difficult to follow directions provided. If I did that in my job, I would be screwed.   I just spent money on a sandwich that is the same value as me picking it out of the garbage."}
{"text":"Food quality has really declined at Quiznos in general, and this location in particular. Bring a magnifying glass if you want to be able to see the meat in the sandwiches they sell now. It's a shame, Quiznos used to be really good."}
{"text":"Your standard Quiznos. Good food. Good service. Nice location. I can recommend this location wholeheartedly. Nothing truly negative worth mentioning."}
{"text":"This is my second time to this location, and my trillionth time to Quiznos! Just like always it taste amazing! I love their sandwiches and it puts subway under the table. At this location the staff is nice, and can take multiple orders at once and not mess up! They make the line move fast! This time I got the traditional on jalape√±o cheddar bread and it was delicious and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had a Quizno's Sandwich.  Groupon had a deal and I bought a few of them, so I had to come here.  I had a regular Italian on Parmesan Bread w/Chips.  It was bleh....there was too much Dressing on the Sandwich and it overpowered the flavors.  Also, the Bread lacked flavor.    If it wasn't for the Groupons, I wouldn't come back.  Return Factor - 20%"}
{"text":"Right from the moment you step foot into this establishment, you immediately feel uneasy. The lighting and the smallness of this restaurant made me feel like I was in a horror film. The surroundings are overall just unpleasant to look at and by no means was this anywhere I wanted to enjoy a meal. The food is overpriced and the quality is not worth your time. My sandwich was flavorless and the meat tasted old. At least now I learned my lesson. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Omg amazing food and great service! I have been coming to this quiznos for so long .... they had an owner change and man what an improvement! Always clean and fast friendly service loved it!!"}
{"text":"These guys make a pretty mean sandwich! Have them toast you up a Mesquite Chicken with Zesty Grill Sauce, on the Jalape√±o Cheddar bread for a tasty meal! A very nice bunch of people working there too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today because my sister had a BOGO coupon and insisted we go there since it's so close.  Food quality is standard Quiznos, of which I have never been a fan. Sister appealed to my cheap side and lured me with a coupon.  The BOGO coupon you ask? Yeah, we couldn't use it. That was irritating. The guy gave us some song and dance about how the coupon was fake (despite the fact we had just used coupons from the same book at a McDonald's about 10 mins prior to coming here with no problems). So I don't know what that was about.  He was perfectly nice about it and gave us a free drink and chips for the trouble.  But still...  Don't get the fountain soda! I got a diet Pepsi and it tasted so gross and strange I threw it out.  The store front was clean but the bathroom was nasty - poop on the toilet seat and no soap in the dispenser. EW. I get very concerned when a food establishment does not have a clean bathroom.  No reason for me to return."}
{"text":"Nancy was super sweet! Patient, friendly, and service was definitely went above and beyond. Thanks Nancy you're great!"}
{"text":"Tried the spicy BBQ pulled pork on jalape√±o bread sandwich. They have this $6, $8, and $10 deal that includes chips and a drink. Thought the sandwich was decent. I did add some extra BBQ sauce to my sandwich when I got home. The manager helped me so the service was good."}
{"text":"the only reason i gave you 1 star is because there is no zero star. we spent over $47 on delivery all we got is a cold sandwiches,when we call back to ask why all you said was that you would be glad to come back and pick it up.NEVER EVER,by the way your store is the only one with the lowest star from the whole las vegas area. just so you know over 100 people work in our building. its like eating frozen food."}
{"text":"I looked at the reviews and wasn't going to buy anything here. However, I saw someone eating a sandwhich and was hungry so I asked the person how was it? They had an Italian sandwhich and said it was good. I decided to go ahead and buy it because there weren't that many choices. This could have been great or at the very least good, but that was not the case. The sandwhich after having gone through the \"toaster\" was cold literally within 30 seconds. The taste was not great but not totally terrible either. There are only three places to eat and quiznos could easily be the spot to eat but it seems quality is lacking everywhere these days. If you can wait then I suggest you wait. However if you are really hungry maybe buy a snack or two it will probably cause about that much or even less."}
{"text":"The friendliest service and the best and freshest tasting sub sandwhiches I ever had. This place is better than Subway. I will continue to come every time I'm in town. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Failed to fully impress. Why?  Simple. I Roll in just before 8. They close at 9. Only one person working counter. Ok. Not busy so let it slide. Other person was in the back closing up. I bought a drink. Wanted sugar/fake sugar free. Saw iced tea dispensers. Bought a drink as a result. Turns out Both offerings were also out of service due to \"clean up\".   The manager should reconsider having their staff close down which results in reduced offerings an hr before closing. There is no excuse. I really think the manager is not aware that their employees are doing this as it is a way to be able to leave on time so they don't end up staying late and not being paid. If he/she doesn't know this then here is their wakeup call. Never seen this before in my life.   My salad,  good size and tasty. No complaints. Wish I could have enjoyed it with iced tea other than some god awful low calorie fountain lemonade. I hate when all I get is a generic \"sorry\". No, you're not."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years. The new management has made the subs better by getting a new oven! Great service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Quiznos, a lot better than some other fast food sandwich places. I think the bread quality is better here and the ingredients are fresher. It just seems so much more convenient to me to order the sandwich from the menu and they prepare it for me. Then I add the extra jalapeno peppers and peppercinis. Also I'm a big fan of their honey mustard sauce."}
{"text":"Narda was super sweet. She's a hard worker & very hospitable. & The sandwiches are delicious!"}
{"text":"I get the meatball sub and their Mac and cheese. Bomb.com. Also the staff here is lovely :) Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I find Quiznos just poor value for what you get. Give me Subway any day."}
{"text":"I had a Peppercorn Prime Rib sandwich here that I can not get out of my mind.  Make sure you get it on wheat bread because you know... healthy.  The Service: well, no one that works here is in any rush.  The parking is a bit of a pain due to the high volume of people going to starbucks next door.  The store is very empty but there is never any outdoor seating because all the starbucks customers are sitting in the Quizno seats."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for lunch.  It's never too busy so it's typically very quick.  Right now they have a $8 lunch combo thats any medium size sandwich, chips and a drink.  I love to get either the Baja BBQ chicken or the Prime Rib peppercorn.  Wheat bread is the way to go... healthy!"}
{"text":"Been to this Quiznos a lot in the last 6 months. Why? Well, apart from being really convenient to my house, the food is good and the service excellent.   Every time I go in I am greeted with big smiles and friendly faces. Quiznos makes a very good sandwich. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they are a little more expensive than other sandwich shops around. But, that won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"When I go to Quiznos, I expect a certain level of quality. I know what I'm supposed to be gettin'... and I didn't get it from this one.  I don't know how many Quiznos I've been to in my lifetime... maybe 5-7 different establishments... and somehow this one doesn't seem up to par.  Case in point: I almost always order the chicken carbonara. It is usually completely full of chicken with sauce just ready to be squeezed out. But not here. Not this Quiznos. The ends were barely filled w/ meat, if at all. I took two full bites of bread... bread alone.  Idk... it just doesn't sit well with me.  Standards people...   standards: fill the dang sandwich.  I've been here twice & maybe this is a \"fool me twice...\" situation. Luckily there are a lot of lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"Of all the sub places out there today, eating at this Quizno's today, I recall what a great sandwich they make!  * Better than Subway, far better; * better than Capriotti's  (I don't understand mixing white and dark meat; am I the only one that that's that discriminating?); and  * better than Jimmy Johns come on now!  Mediocre cold cuts, lots of mustard and delivery. And that's all they got.   I like the Quizno's product, I like the \"fix-ins' bar and let me tell you, THE OWNERS/OPERATORS of THIS QUIZNO's LOCATION ARE EASILY THE NICEST, MOST GRACIOUS PEOPLE IN ALL ARIZONA!!!!!!  (See, the pink lemonade dispensing machine was broken, and really, that was the reason that I stopped in. They retrieved the product for me, from the back, which they didn't have to do.)  Try THIS location!!  And thank you Quizno's store 03607!"}
{"text":"Can't complain about this one, is a good alternative to subway. it's also the only one around brookpark and I hope they don't forget that and close it down. it is not as cheap as subway but you do get better tasting subs and quality food.  people there have always been nice as well."}
{"text":"Make sure to ask about the level your sandwich will be toasted. My sandwich was cold. I did not go back to the location because it was far from my departing gate. The whole purpose of Quiznos is for toasted subs/sandwiches. Now I regret walking all the way over there from concourse E. I've had toasted sandwiches from Quiznos before and for the price this location charges, one would think they would be more diligent about toasting the toasted sandwich as it is advertised. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"The worst 10 dollar sandwich I ever did eat. The lady working the counter was nice. The bread tastes like subway (before they took out all of the chemicals) and the meat is just not right."}
{"text":"I don't love this location, but it's convenient and gets the job done. It doesn't seem like the cleanest Quiznos, and the staff moves really slowly at times. The line also gets crazy long for lunch, and it can take a while.  The sandwiches are good though, and they hit the spot, all while  being a good, quick option for lunch. My favorites are the Mesquite Chicken sandwich and the Black Angus Steak sandwich.  I definitely prefer Quiznos to the other sandwich places any day."}
{"text":"Went to eat here... walked in, zero employees. No chairs at their tables. There was a long line and no one behind the counter. When someone did show up, they looked confused and flustered and annoyed. We walked out and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"I just went to this location again and AGAIN there was barely any meat. I asked if they changed how much meat theyre putting on the sandwiches and they said yes because corporate got mad and now they're limited to only putting 2 oz of meat... AKA 2 lil slices of meat. If thats the case then corporate needs to lower their prices then too. No one wants to pay the same amount for less meat. They also should change their advertisements which show sandwiches full of meat to a sorry ass looking sandwich with mostly lettuce in it. I came home added more meat to my sandwich from the fridge today. Never going back there again. Quiznos can just go out of business now. They were my favorite sandwich place in the past but now i just don't care. Taking my business to Jersey Mikes from now on. Oh and thanks to your cool employees today you got extra stars from me because you really deserve negative 25 stars. Bye Quiznos!"}
{"text":"I went here a while back and I forget what kind of sandwich I ordered but the guy put my meat in what looked like dirty dish water before whisking it away for whatever was the next step. I never went back."}
{"text":"Great experience, this location is actually the first Quiznos I've ever been to. In our experience today my wife and I needed a quick bite before we off on our adventures at Target. During our visit two different customers were rude to the staff here. Both times they smiled and dealt with unkind customers. They are extremely professional and provide great service. They pay attention to detail and keep the place nice and clean!"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't think about reviewing a fast food place but when the staff is as nice as these folks they deserve it. It's Quiznos, so you're going to get a fast, toasted sub, that tastes amazing because, well.. it's fast fast food. Always quick, smiling staff, and way better than alternatives like Subway."}
{"text":"I should of wrote this review months ago. This is the best sub / sandwich / lunch / if you need something eat , spot in the area. I work walking  distance and made I can grab a sub at 11 and be full till 9 pm . They stack their subs here and they take care of their customers. They also have a few funny staff members. So I always like to get the chipotle cheddar steak , so good with little bit of extra turkey and made that sub would satisfy a charging bear.   Anyways the place is in a business center sonit can be a little hard to find due to a tree up front but it is completely worth the find."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch around 330 pm.  Apparently they thought business was over because they simply restock shelves and ignored me.  I went to fill up with unsweetened iced tea mention to them that it was out and they simply took away the container.  Sandwich was good.  But I will be reluctant to return."}
{"text":"Don't have menu items  Went there to get a lobster macaroni and cheese, the last time I went they did not have lobster, this time they did not have lobster AGAIN, so I ordered plain macaroni and cheese, after waiting 10 minutes they told me they had macaroni but NO CHEESE???"}
{"text":"The black Angus steak sub was excellent but the employee Amir Najafti, I had a horrible experience with. He needs to smile an not have a angry face like he was not happy working there. Also needs to greet customers when coming in and while leaving."}
{"text":"Well the sandwich was ok.  The price was outrageous.  I ordered a 12 inch ham and cheese with lettuce, tomato and cheese.   It cost me $14.75 .  That was ridiculous! We won't be going their again."}
{"text":"Have not been to a Quiznos in years and  this place did not disappoint. The staff was so nice and even gave attention my kids. The place was very clean and well kept. The bathroom were also vey clean. I know that we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! Excellent service, super clean and the food is fantastic. I actually live in another county and drive here when I want a sandwich.   Nice quiet atmosphere with outdoor seating. Easy to find and free parking.   Make sure you get a brownie!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed ordered 2 sandwiches and two soups.  One of the sandwiches was smashed (we had delivery) and the forgot the chili.  Waited almost 40 minutes for the order and paid $4.00 for delivery and smashed and forgotten??  You would think they would at least offer to credit the meal and/or offer a replacement meal for another night - nothing!!!!  Threw the sandwich away and had a bowl of cereal!  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"I fly through Charlotte airport almost weekly and stop by Quizno's at least one time during the week. I always get the Veggie Guacamole Sandwich, chips and water. The sandwich is always good and very filling. There is always a little bit of a wait but there is at most of the restaurants in the airport.   The only negative and the reason for the 4 instead of 5 star is the customer service. It is not overwhelmingly pleasant but they are not rude either.   I'll continue my weekly sub from this location."}
{"text":"This Quizno's is tucked away in a shopping center at the corner of Monroe and Sardis Rd. North.  Seems like a lot of the businesses in this shopping center are struggling... some have already closed, but the normal chains (McDonalds and FedEx Office) are still open and strong.  Since there is a lack of businesses that are open, the parking lot is pretty free and clear.  Makes it seem a little lonely but at least you aren't battling anyone for spaces or cursing the parking lot designer for the poor design.  There are a few tables inside and they were kept clean.  The service line seemed a bit slow since there were only 2 people working but it seems like the franchise owner was working the register.  He knew people that came in (as regulars) and was pretty friendly.  Made a decent sandwich and my stomach was satisfied by the toasted sub."}
{"text":"Quizno's is Quizno's pretty much.   This one is located in a strip mall off of Flamingo. It's right next to a Zaba's Mexican Grill. The parking lot is a zoo during lunch hours.   The inside is clean. The staff is friendly. I've only stopped in once after work to grab a sandwich to go. The sandwich was decently made. I asked for extra banana peppers and I received them. Strangely enough I saw that this Quiznos had a bottle of the Batch 88 sauce out. I haven't see the Batch 88 sauce out at the Quizno's that is closer to my house. I love that stuff. Remember when Quizno's used to have a little bar where they had the sauce and banana peppers and other sauces so you could grab them at your convenience? I do. But I never see that little bar in Quizno's anymore.  Overall - they make decent sandwiches, they complied to my add ons with no fuss, and the store was clean (from what I saw of it), can't complain, it's a decent place."}
{"text":"Very nice people and good location, however, they skimp on toppings and meat. I won't be back unless this changes."}
{"text":"The subs here are generally better than subway as far as turkey options go. The price is about the same +/- a few cents. The biggest advantage they have is that you can actually get whole wheat bread here. They also have the better fountain drink refill station since they carry coke freestyle. Each refill is 50 cents though. This particular location is well stocked. My only gripe is that you don't get too see most of the sub-making process. You have to tell them what you want right away."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I ordered a tuna melt, but it ended up with NO tuna in it...they just gave me a bread with lettuce cucumber and onions. I came back and asked them, they told me they had no tuna so they can only give this to me ...astonished...why don't you let me know this when I order? Super disappointed. Never again."}
{"text":"Owner lacks customer service. He's often in the shop making subs and is absolutely terrible at it. For example my Baja chicken sub lacked the Baja sauce and included very little bacon. I will no longer visit this location."}
{"text":"I used to work here twelve years ago when it was ran by different owners, and it was horrible then. I remember stopping in here about two years ago and was surprised to see that it's now run by a small family. The owners are EXTREMELY nice, customer service is out of this world. The place is always spotless, the food tastes fresh, and it's just overall great. Definitely stop in if you're hungry, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best Quiznos I have ever eaten at.The owners are very friendly and always remember you. The ingredients are fresh and the subs are fabulous.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to subtract a star because I just don't care for the new menu.  I guess they are trying to be more healthy to compete with Subway.  But they still have the same calorie laden sauces, most of the sandwhiches come with mayo by default, and fatty meat (which apparently now is hormone-free which is a good thing).  Just adding extra tomato and lettuce after it goes thru the toaster does not make it healthy.  And now instead of being toasty and bubbly with cheese, they are lukewarm with cold veggies.  Yuck.  And what's up with loosing the cantina chicken and the few other selections I actually liked?  Yes, I could \"build my own\" but I don't want to think on my lunch break.  I just want to order and have you make it for me.  Just give me my Cantina Chicken Sammie, dammit.  They have lost everything that previously made them better than Subway.  The only thing keeping them from one star is the fact that they still have Sunchips and the zero calorie pink grapefruit SoBe."}
{"text":"I was greeted warmly. The menu items were explained well and I was even offered a sample when I couldn't decide what salad dressing to get.  The salads that were being prepared looked pretty delicious! Time to pay...  Before ringing me up, I informed the cashier that I had a Groupon to use. She said I had to have a voucher printed out. Then, she showed me a handwritten post it next to the employee phone that stated coupons must be originals, not from an email or phone. She told me it must say that on my Groupon... So I showed her. She said to me, \"See! You need to follow the directions and it says 1. Print Groupon.\" I kindly showed her the following statement which says, \"(or pull it up with our mobile app).\"  She said, \"I don't know how to do that. It probably is for a Phoenix location. THIS is not Phoenix.\" Duh, I knew where I was... exactly where the Groupon directions led me! LOL.   Anyhow, we went back and forth for a bit and she rang me up. I told her I wasn't going to get anything and she was livid... She called me rude for ordering and walking away. That's not exactly how I see it happening. She told me that she has never heard of a company giving a discount without proof of a voucher, that it would be like giving something away. Huh... sigh.   So basically my review is about customer service and not the food as I didn't get a chance to try it. Generally, Quiznos is pretty tasty too. :-("}
{"text":"Disgusting food. They only put half of the amount as they should for sandwiches. Bought a honey mustard chicken salad that was missing half the toppings and my lettuce was yellow!"}
{"text":"I normally love Quiznos,  but the customer service at this one left something to be desired.  Staff had irritated responses to questions and choose to  gossip instead of washing down the tables.  The food was excellent,  but the staff... Ugh."}
{"text":"Visited this location yesterday and I had to write a review for their awesome Baja sandwich.  It was a tad spicy (Chipotle mayo) and savory (bbq sauce).  I liked that they toast their sandwiches before handing it to you.  The guy (sorry i forgot to look at your name tag) didn't hesitate to give me veggies on this sandwich even though it usually doesn't come with any.  :)   We also order ...I believe it was the mesquite sandwich...It must've been from eating the tasty Baja that I found this sandwich to be more bland.      Service was professional.  The sandwich was good.  Can't complain but rather, just compliment.  I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"When they weigh the meat on the scale, I just wanna scream!!!!  SO cheap.  I've stopped going because of that, and because, for some reason, they only sell soup (my favourite food) during the fall and winter.  What?  Soup's seasonal?    Anyway, I always left this place feeling like I'd been had.  I've never been to another Quiznos, so I don't know if weighing the meat is standard.  But if it is, I don't know how they survive.  Way too expensive for what they crank out."}
{"text":"I think this is a great local sandwich shop. Quiznos always makes great sandwiches but the owners and staff make this location special."}
{"text":"Fire Doug! I have been here twice and the service is incredibly slow. You cannot get a hot sub because Doug takes f o r e v e r. I waited 20 minutes for two subs today. TWENTY MINUTES!  The food is good (if you like cold subs) and the place is clean but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"By far the worst Quizno's and fast food place I've ever been to. The owner (Asian dude) yelled at me for trying to use a coupon even though the coupon was for that location. I literally walked out and promised to never return. It's sad to see a busines owner so totally clueless on how to run a business and create loyal customers."}
{"text":"Been to this Quiznos multiple times and I have to say that the staff is always extremely helpful and friendly. The store is normally very clean and the food is fresh. It's not usually too busy here, so you can easily get in and out on your lunch break."}
{"text":"this location is closed. no longer in business. im adding more info because this program wants me  to write a certain number of characters. just letting everyone that you can drive there but it is no longer a quiznos. there yelp, is that enough info for ya!  by the way...i love quiznos sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Walk into the store at 3:20 on a Sunday. Door is wide open. All the lights are on. Worker behind the counter tells me they closed at 3:00pm. 3pm!?! On a Sunday? First off, why so early? Second, why not update google, yelp, or yahoo?  Third, why was the door wide open 20 minutes after close!?! Calling the store manager tomorrow."}
{"text":"Another great day guys @ Quiznos 40th street and broadway  today I had the chipotle steak and cheddar sub really it was very good. I had before the black angus steak house it was yummy too there all subs were delicious  and the Costmer care was very good"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches places in Phoenix  area. Thanks  guys good team work keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Just stopped in after working on this side of town, I am sure glad to see that Quiznos was around. I had my usual Italian and a side of soup. The service was great. And the sandwich was great as well. I have had a hard time finding Quiznos lately but I am happy to find one somewhat close to me. I will be back in the future"}
{"text":"I was in the hospital for 8 hours next door and hit Yelp for a quick bite. The customer service was great! Sandwich perfect, they were even kind enough to open the shades when I sat down allowing me to see the sunset on the west hill. Nice spot when you have been at the hospital all day.  Cleanliness extra on point as well"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE WORKERS. I went in to create my own sandwich and the guy there said I couldn't choose my own sauces so he put them on for me, he burnt my sandwich, charged me extra for stuff I didn't order and forgot to give my change back. Not once did he apologize for any of these things and he also had a horrible attitude. Not cool."}
{"text":"I ate her for the first time a few weeks ago. I've been back like 6 times since then! I am hooked on the prime rib dip :) Fast and clean and they also had a groupon going around."}
{"text":"Usually I love their chili but this location it didn't really taste as good. I also got the very last bowl of the pot so that could be it. The heated pita that I ordered with it was very good to dip in the chili though!"}
{"text":"I could tell this place was under new management once I saw that it had been slightly remodeled inside plus the service has not been as stellar as it used to be under the prior management. I've gone in twice since new management has taken over and the first time was alright but the second time was kind of ridiculous. Only one person ahead of us in line and there were at least two or more people working but only one actually making subs/taking orders. There was one guy who was just twiddling his thumbs and not helping the guy making the subs which made absolutely no sense to me. We ended up walking out due to how long it was taking just to take orders and make subs for the people in front of us in line. This place is not the same and I won't be rushing to come here anytime soon anymore. I miss the old owners and their warmth and kindness. That sort of thing is sorely lacking with these owners in particular. Guess it's time to call it quits on this Quiznos."}
{"text":"I think I just bought the worse sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. Aren't Quiznos subs supposed to be toasty? The bread is cold, the cheese is non-existent and as the other reviewer said, the tuna tastes like paste. Paste that has been sitting in a bucket for 4 days. And now you have to ask them for the toppings. I requested jalape√±os and banana peppers and I swear I got one of each.  I'm starving but not enough to even finish this sandwich. Should have gone the two extra miles to get to Potbelly's instead."}
{"text":"I wanted to try the new 2.99 pork sandwhich. I was with my dad & we walked in & we weren't greated at all. There were only two people working there & they seemed like they hated there job. They were unfriendly & had a bad attitude. My sandwhich was mooshy & fell apart even though it went through the toaster. My dad wanted wheat bread but it was frozen. So it had to get a smaller bread, the Sammie's size. I couldn't even enjoy my sandwhich because it fell apart. I'm trying to take a survey online to get a few sandwhich & the survey is closed."}
{"text":"THE FOOD  Standard Quiznos fair. Pretty consistent in quality. I recommend skipping the fountain drinks if you are sensitive to water taste.  SETTING  Standard sandwich chain shop, clean.  SERVICE  Fast, friendly  and consistent. Just the way I like it when I am hungry.  SUMMARY  Nothing exceptional but nothing to complain about either. Good place to grab your sandwich."}
{"text":"Toasty Torpedo. $4 and I'm good for lunch. The ladies that work here are very nice."}
{"text":"They have great toasted hoagies. The meat is always full of flavor and I enjoy the Italian hoagie with the dressing; that's my favorite. We typically eat here on the weekdays when we are off work.  They have a lot of choices too, some healthy and some not so much They have some interesting sides for a hoagie shop like baked mac-n-cheese. It was actually pretty good, the creamy kind. I actually added pickles to it and was really awesome. A weird combo I know but somehow for me it worked.  Great quick place to grab a bite, awesome sides, and raspberry lemonade. Join online club for visits toward a free sandwich. Who doesn't love free food."}
{"text":"I have to completely disagree with Roy A - and I am not usually a fan of Quinos! I don't typically get Quiznos when I'm out - I figure if I'm downtown, there are way more interesting things to eat than a sub. And when I'm at home in Pickering, there aren't that many options so usually a sub is the standard go-to, and there isn't a Quiznos out there.  My experience with this Quiznos location has been WONDERFUL. We have corporate events/guests come to my work quite frequently in the summer and the caterer at work is rather expensive. One of the other departments had Quiznos and so my boss asked me to look into it. Since then, they're my go to for corporate lunch meetings.  First of all, the staff here are wonderful. I'm not exactly who I've spoke with each time (always the same super nice and accommodating woman) but they're fantastic at helping you figure out your needs. Last time I needed subs to feed 25+ and she managed to work it out to fit in my budget. Not only that, but I gave her a few dietary restrictions and she was easily able to work with them (one type of their bread works for vegans, who knew?). She made sure to ask me what kind of subs I wanted (tuna, roast beef, if bacon was okay...) and anything I said no to wasn't in the order. They made sure we had everything we needed before we left the store with our order (yes, they're willing to deliver but they're not far from work so I brought lackeys to help me carry our food back), including some of the optional toppings like the hot peppers, paper plates, napkins, straws, etc.   Like I said before, I'm not exactly partial to Quiznos myself, but the party platters are a ridiculously good idea for meetings like this. You get a medium pizza-sized box full of partial subs that are all individually wrapped and CLEARLY labelled so you know exactly what's inside. They were a HUGE hit at our working meeting, everyone came back for seconds and some for thirds, most of the subs were gone and what was left, there was still a good variety (not all one sub that no one likes). The price was right too. We got a LOT of food, including two custom dietary orders, as well as extras for about $140, working out to about $7-10 per person. For me, I was really impressed with the quality of the food and how good the subs were. Might even make me a convert! I loved getting to try all different kinds of subs and overall, everything tasted really fresh and yummy!   Given that Quiznos is \"just another sub joint\" they've done a great job at providing quality food for casual working meetings for my workplace. The quality of food is definitely there and I'll keep going back here for any kinds of events I need food for. Really happy with the service and the food - keep it up :) You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I tried the pulled pork Cubano and it was a decent sandwich. I love a authentic Cubano and this particular one was average. For some reason there was not a drop of mustard on my sandwich, which as everyone knows, is the key ingredient on a Cubano sandwich.   Despite someone forgetting the mustard, the sandwich was A-OK."}
{"text":"You seriously  are charging $0.39 for sides of sauce, even though I just bought a $12  sub, where do you get off.   I'm I the middle of my meal, I walk up ask for a side of vinegar and with a straight face she says $0.39, wow. I'm only asking because the sub is dry to begin with.   Not welcoming at all, why would I ever return to a place that is willing to rip its customers off like that.    The steak sub I ordered tasted like dry grocery store roast beef, the sauce station has been removed, this is my  first Quiznos visit  in 3 years and it's definitely my last.  I honestly want my money back, except for the drink and chips I'll pay for those as they were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"It's Quiznos.  Yes, sticker shock, but it's the airport.  My 8\" Italian on Rosemary filled me up.  The crew working this location is not super fast, but the end product was consistent with my Quiznos expectations."}
{"text":"Not a traditional Quiznos regular; but, the facility across street from courthouse is always clean, staff is super nice and the food at a good price point. . .especially considering options nearby.  Most other vendors in adjacent areas can't seem to keep the doors open.  One Way next door shut its doors recently, as did the sandwich / breakfast place next to that.  Food at Court Cafe is at best mediocre and at worst stomach turning.  Buffett at hotel across street at times good, but you're going to lay out some coin."}
{"text":"Damn you Quizno's. Your sandwiches are so good. And oh so fatty.    I can't stop eating the veggie sandwich.  It's by no means healthy, but it's exceptionally delicious.  It's loaded with cheese and some kind of oil based dressing that is sure to have 20 grams of fat per serving.   And then of course I have to get chips and a soda and by that time, my calorie intake is probably in the thousands.  Jared would never dream of getting the veggie sandwich, but I do.  When I want low-fat veggie sandwiches, I go to Subway. But when I want a delicious veggie sandwich that meets my recommended fat and calorie intake for the day, I go to Quizno's."}
{"text":"Small skinny sandwiches with high price-tried it once never again.  And openning up across from subway wasn't to smart."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the facility is really small - not enough space for people to eat and also it lacks (as others stated) in the cleanliness department..."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the best quizno's that I've been too. I stop in here for lunch often and am rarely disappointed. I mean it's a fast food chain, they're going to make minor mistakes once in a while.  They're always quick with my order and the place is clean. I've used several coupons there in the past and have never had a problem with them accepting them.   I disagree with one of the previous reviews that says the value is poor. Price is comparable if not better than most other sandwich chains.   Way better than Mr. Sub!!!"}
{"text":"First we find a wad of hair in a sandwich. Then i almost choke on a metal shard in my meatball  sub. Now the messed up our sandwich and when we asked them to fix it the lady there starts complaining to another customer about me for wanting my sandwich correct.  This place is just awful."}
{"text":"Yuck. Yuck. Yuck.  Double Yuck.   Remind me to never ever again get a tuna sub from this place. It was like eating slimy cat food on a tasteless roll.   Bad on me for even attempting this. As I do not eat red meat anymore I needed something to have for dinner on the long flight back to NYC and tuna seemed like a decent enough choice. Service was pleasant and quick enough. Basic airport prices.  I ate basically half of the sandwich and wanted to hurl. Left the other half under my seat on the plane. I bet that was a fun surprise for the cleaning crew!  How the heck is Quiznos still a thing anyway? Do your stomach and taste buds a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, my customer service has always been great after these owners bought the location.prices are in line with the quality. A level above subway."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise to find a Quiznos open, even better when I actually had the sandwich. Tasted great.  It's a shame there aren't more Quiznos like this one."}
{"text":"Great ... Had to stop on my way to soccer game had worked really really late was very very hungry didn't know what to order and it was in a rush the girl said \" try our new lobster\" / very good thank you !!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service and quality of food.  Sandwich barely had three thin slices of meat and the cheese was so thin you couldn't taste it.  The person making my sandwich couldn't understand me, language barrier, and I had to repeat myself several times.  Also I was getting the lunch special. A small sandwich, soda and chips. I asked if I could a small soup in lieu of the chips and soda and was told yes for more money. (Again a language barrier). I'm very unhappy that there wasn't a slightly more healthy alternative.  Oh well. will not come here again."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, and a nice location.  Quiznos has very good subs.  It's a reliable grab when you're out on the road and need something to fill your belly.  Pricier than you're average \"fast food\" sub, but they taste better.  I don't know of any other place to get a chicken carbonara sub - those are amazing."}
{"text":"I came here last night not really wanting to come. Im more of a port of subs gal. However, the people I was with wanted quiznos. So I gave in. Not that quiznos is bad or anything. Well we got there and the two lady's working last night were very nice and helpful. We got our food and I noticed they had sobe's. As a power fruit punch drinker I am used to it never being in stock ANYWHERE I go but I thought I would take a look and maybe get lucky. Oh my!!! They had it. The food was good and the customer service was great but they got a 5 star rating from me just for having Sobe power fruit punch!!!"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: It's an airport Quiznos. Be smart about what you pick here, get the chicken, and keep it simple.  Pro: It's quick, the service is nice, and it'll keep you going.  Con: Quality ranges from \"eh\" to \"dear God\", so... choose the safest sandwiches."}
{"text":"I realize how pretentious it is to review an airport Quiznos. However, this $9 salad I just gave up on is particularly bad. Most of the ingredients are literally frozen. The tomatoes also taste like rancid little iced cubes. Gross. Will not return."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! I signed up for yelp just to say this.....food was not good."}
{"text":"It seems very appropriate to me that the option for a sandwich restaurant in an airport would consist of Quizno's and not Subway. After all, people are often in a hurry at airports, as I was. Who has the time to specify all the contents of a sandwich and catch a flight that's leaving soon? I generally like Subway as a fast food restaurant, but Quizno's works better here as it has predetermined items on the menu that take less time to prepare.  I gave their simple menu a glance and ordered a \"The Traditional\" sandwich for $7.49 ($8.11) after tax. I think this sandwich was eight inches and offered many of the ingredients commonly found in sandwiches as the name suggests. Meats consisted of roast beef, turkey breast, and ham. To round it all off, they included cheddar, black olives, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and buttermilk ranch dressing. All in all, a decent sandwich and a great option for food at the airport."}
{"text":"Good stuff.   Quality product.  Always a good goto.   I like the chicken sandwiches.  The carbonara when I'm feeling particularly decadent.   Its rich and delicious.   I usually order it without mushrooms.  They hit the spot regularly."}
{"text":"Service is slow for an informal sandwich place but if you're hungry, you just need patience.   Quizno's  is located at the food court in the Riviera.  You can enter through the casino or from the Strip.  Average sandwich.  I prefer Subway over Quizno's."}
{"text":"Good sandwich shop, friendly employee, odd location. Would do again, great thing us all subs are the same price."}
{"text":"I came here after work on a saturday and I walk in and this lady looks at me like she hated working there.  I ordered my sub and when she asked me what I wanted on my sub, I said \"just lettuce\" twice.  At time same time I was paying for my order and I repeated to her again to add lettuce on it.  After I paid and went home and checked my sub ... of course she did NOT add lettuce on it.  I was pretty aggravated because I even gave her a tip and she couldnt even get my order right. Ugh!  I probably wont go back to this specific quiznos again."}
{"text":"Today's visit to my neighborhood Quiznos, I was very unhappy. There was little to no meat on my sandwich, the pickle, pepper and condiment station was already closed at 7:45 when they close at nine. And the cashier lady forced me into buying a large drink. Sandwich was absolutely terrible. No meat on it. Also why do you guys bake the bread at like 13 inches only to cut off an inch and throw it out. Why not bake the bread smaller or just give me the extra inch of bread for free ? Lol cheap people. Not to mention 20 dollars for two sandwiches is INSANE. Go to jersey mikes. Same price. Maybe even a little cheap. Muuuuuch better quality and more meat and over just a better place and food. Quiznos you lost my respect today. I wanted the free pickles with my sub, the amount of meat a sandwich should have on it, and a fair price. Sorry won't be back"}
{"text":"It's a Quizno's, so it has all the standard fare, sammies, huge f'ing subs, and that delicious lemonade. This is the location I go to most often because it is right by my office, and they do a decent job.  Because they are located in an office park, keep in mind that they close at 5 so don't count on it as a dinner spot.  I love to grab two veggie sammies...flatbread topped with cheese and a veg assortment. They are a great, quick item to grab for lunch, and they tend to be pretty generous with the toppings at this location."}
{"text":"Came here only to use their bathroom. It was very clean but the men's toilet clogs. You also need a bathroom key."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch last week. The place is very small, cramped. They only have like 4 little tables that seat two people and one that sits four. The place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the Galleria area. Service was slow and kinda confusing.  They were out of several items, specifically, cilantro, which was one of the main ingredients in Becky's sub. The problem wasn't that they were out, but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in mid-production.  Mine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub, it was barely warm.  Not that this is their fault, as they only serve it, but stay away from the Honey Lemonade they have. It's disgusting.  The place was fairly clean and well stocked and organized. The staff were friendly. The two main sandwich guys spoke very little English so I had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks. To boot, they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth. Not major, but noticeable.  Not awful, but they can improve."}
{"text":"I don't generally like fast food because it's just gross but I was starving and we had a 3 hour layover.    My sub was like eating a brick of salt.  I could only eat half of it and that was really pushing it.   I asked the cashier for a napkin. She pointed to the empty containers and told me they were over there.  After looking and telling her they were empty she sent someone out to refill them.  I waited 10 minutes for a napkin."}
{"text":"friendly service and great subs, clean and bright - never disappointed"}
{"text":"I was getting work done on the car and quiznos was across the street so around lunch time I stopped by. It's your typical Quizno's. There's something I love about sandwich shops toasted bread. I of course got myself the large turkey sandwich with all the veggies. I just don't feel as guilty eating out at quiznos since it is not as unhealthy. There was only one employee which I kind of felt bad since it was crowded and she was having to hustle. She was still very friendly and patient with people as they were trying to make up their minds. The inside is clean for a small place and there are also table outside if you wanted to eat out there.  I give it 3 stars since the food is good and would definitely eat there again when getting car repairs."}
{"text":"Food is terrible! I hadn't eaten quiznos in years because I always thought the food was sub par and overpriced. Thought I would try it again. It is in fact worse than I remember. The people that work at this location are slow, lazy and unfriendly. Honestly I think they should give me my money back."}
{"text":"Quiznos is my FAVORITE sub shop ever! I was so sad when so many started to close wish they would open more again!"}
{"text":"Quizno Subs are usually the same at different locations (you can't go wrong with the chicken carbanara)...but what makes this particular location great is the people that work here.  Every time I've been in has always been a treat definitely good peeps. so based on service I give this particular Quiznos a rousing three thumbs up with a touch of draper status!!!!!  theres no place better for some fast food sandy's!!!!   P.S. sorry Subway! you lost me at cheap tasting lettuce, stale bread and spungy chicken!   Andy, over and out......and over again!"}
{"text":"Location is now closed. Only 4 quiznos left in the entire las vegas area... wowzer."}
{"text":"The staff was nice enough, the food was good, but if management is reading this, the restaraunt itself was really dirty. There was no lunch rush so there is no excuse for dirty floors, tables, chairs, and a full trashcan."}
{"text":"I love their Prime Rib sandwiches.  The horseradish makes them soooooo good.  These are the same as any Quiznos.  The food is great, 4-5 stars easy for fast food sandwiches.  The 2 star review comes from the service here.    I've been coming to this location since I moved to Phoenix- over 2 years ago.  First off, every time I come here there are different people working.   Granted, I'm not here more than 2-3 times a month, but still.  Second, for the longest time, their horseradish dispenser was broken.  This was so damn annoying.  Every time I wanted horseradish I had to ask for it. And often they gave me a small half filled container which makes it hard to drown my prime rib in.  Third, the location for this place is awful.  It's next to a pool supply store and some other random places that no one ever goes to.  Plust taking a left turn out of here is impossible.     Finally, about a year ago, I drove here and the place was shut down.  Sucks because I love my Quiznos, but it also made sense because this location was horrible.  A few months ago, it opened back up.  Finally, they fixed the horseradish dispenser! Yay!    My experience tonight here is worth writing a review for however.  First off the people in front of me (Justin Beiber-esque looking teenagers- or for the older crowd- they looked like DJ Connor from Roseanne) ordered multiple sandwiches each.  Fine, so I waited.  Finally the girl who helped me (who looked about 11 years old- no joke) made my sandwich and threw it in the Quizno's heater converyor belt thing.  The other girl working at the cash register was talking on the phone, but eventually got off to ring me up.     As she was packing my sandwich up she noticed something wrong with the meat so she decided she would have the munchkin kid re-make it.  Fine.  So I'm waiting there and there is some creepy dude with a mustache eyeing the 11 year old looking munchkin girl.  Weird. Then he says, \"Love ya!\" So I think it was her dad.  Finally, about a half hour after entering the store, I got my sandwich and took off.  It was delicious, and they did give me a free drink."}
{"text":"If you have to hit up the courthouse, this place offers validation for the parking deck (up to 90 minutes) as well as the cafe next door. I don't normally review chain restaurants, let alone semi fast food place, but I want to say that the young people working at this location were doing a good job. They greeted me, prepared food quickly, and kept the place pretty clean! Well done. Please note that per their sign by the cash register, this location does NOT accept any coupons."}
{"text":"Love Quiznos. Only 5 left in the Valley. Owners are very nice and sandwiches are awesome. Gave us free dessert on my girls birthday."}
{"text":"I have never before been disappointed in Quiznos food before. I ordered the ultimate turkey club, a fairly safe sandwich to order. They globed the mayonnaise on the sandwiches and when they came out of the toaster the sandwich racks bumped INTO the sandwich in front of it. On top of that, my mom ordered the lobster sandwich after asking the worker if the sandwich was especially fishy and she said no. She only ate 1 bite of it. Worst $20 spent. If you want good food, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"The Quizno's is within walking distance from where I work so I'll usually go and grab a small Cobb Salad.  Priced at just under $4.00 you get a nice little serving that will tied you over until dinner.  One tip, ask them to put your Blu Cheese on the side.  They usually pile too much on there and Blu Cheese is already powerful so it can get to be too much.  It also comes with Chicken, Bacon, Eggs, and tomatoes.  You can add to it also; I always add onion.  The one thing that I don't like is that it comes in this little bowl and they pack so much in there that it makes it difficult to eat.  Here's my solution...place half on the lid and keep the other half in the bowl.  Eat one half then the other and you will truly enjoy this salad."}
{"text":"Over ten years of flying out of CLT and somehow I'd missed Quiznos in the main food court atrium, closer to the C checkpoint. I've had airport Quiznos before and this was similar.  My turkey sandwich on wheat was assembled properly and toasted nicely, topped well. A-OK."}
{"text":"This location is closed. My only question is what took so long? Quiznos food isn't very good but it's better than some other sandwich shops.   The reason this location should've been closed a long time ago is the service. The woman who runs/owns the place was a total C*NT! She was always rude. She had no idea how to move the process along which made ordering & getting a sandwich take 10times longer than it needed to. The People making the sandwiches were inept. I see the closing if this place as justice. She & her staff should NEVER be allowed to serve the public again!"}
{"text":"Had an egg, cheese & steak sandwich on rosemary parmesan bread. Tasted fresh & very good. Had difficulty understanding cashier when I asked what flavored bread are offered for this breakfast option.   I am very patient & compassionate to anyone whose 1st language isn't English. Took me a few moments to understand what she was saying due to her extremely incomprehensible heavy accent. I had to ask her to repeat it a few times and very slowly since the menu board did not state what type of bread there are.   A person who speak clear understandable English should be at the counter taking orders. I was not the only one who had difficulty understanding her speech. Due to the situation, it caused a line & customers to walk away."}
{"text":"Cashier was in a bad mood, my \"Classic Italian\" sandwich came with black olives, and wasn't toasty enough. I was there at 6am so i'm wondering if the toaster wasn't warmed up correctly this early."}
{"text":"Took a customer there last week.  As we walked in the place was full of smoke from something burnt in the cooking area.  Included with the smoke filled room, the room was at an uncomfortable level whereas we decided before placing our order to make sure it was to take out.  As for the service, well it's as good as the environment.  I would strongly suggest going somewhere else for those looking for all around quality."}
{"text":"Sorry this location fails to offer the level of sandwich making expertise that I've experienced at better locations.    My sandwich was over sauced and put together sloppily.  Maybe the guy was new or the manager just didn't care to offer him adequate training.  But it was my second time going there with subpar quality.  When I got home and opened up the sandwich it was soaked and no way to eat it easily.  I think the owner should take a little more interest in what's going on inside their location."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch because Quiznos happens to be one of my favourite sub places and was deeply disappointed. I'm a big fan of their peppercorn steak and since I used to work for Quiznos, I know the exact recipe by heart. The peppercorn steak I got for lunch did not taste anything like I remembered. The beef was bland, no taste and some parts of the meat in the sub had a weird chewy texture - definitely not a good thing.  What I noticed next was the lack of toppings. I asked for Swiss cheese instead of mozzarella and they said they were out of Swiss cheese (in my mind I was confused because a lot of the sandwiches use Swiss cheese for their recipes??). Next I asked for green peppers, but they were out. They were also out of several other toppings as the signs for them were marked off.  This was during lunch hour. Not a good start, if you asked me.   Service was friendly and quick, but that's about it for what was good. I don't think I'll be back, at least not at this location."}
{"text":"Normal Quiznos quality. Good food. Clean place, well taken care of! Only one person was working and you could tell she was a little overwhelmed by the line. She was making the food and ringing us up, so she was working hard, but I hope they usually have more help here."}
{"text":"Standard Quizno's quality. Plenty of staff so no lines. Bathrooms were clean. No complaints here. I would come again."}
{"text":"I bought a 9 inch turkey sub today at this location. On my second to last bite, I bit something hard and I pulled it out of my mouth. At first I tried to figure it out but couldn't, it resembled a 1/4 tooth pick. I finished my last bite and proceeded to place an order of a Sammie and showed the sandwich maker.  When I showed her what I found in my sub, this was her response verbatim- 'it is not within our control' I was upset because she was not apologetic nor showed any form of empathy. I told her that she needs to give this feedback to the owner and she continued saying those same words. I was taken back by this, especially in a time of many options and variety. I most like won't buy another sub there."}
{"text":"This Quiznos is off Chandler Blvd in Ahwatukee. The store is always empty so I don't know how they are still open but they are. Food is okay and service is average. I suggest that you eat your sandwich there rather than take out because your sandwich will get soggy... Lol"}
{"text":"I used to prefer Quizno's over all other sandwich chains but I no longer feel that way.    I find their menu confusing with too many options.  It's like double the selection of other sub places and it makes choices difficult.  Also they don't seem to stuff the sandwich like I remember them doing before.  I guess it's all about cost/weight these days but I felt my sandwich was a little thin on meat.  The plus side of Quizno's is the condiment bar where you can add your own extras from pickles, peppers and an assortment of sauces.  The restaurant is also clean, well laid out and they have a great patio for a sub place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service. Happened to run into the owner...great guy. This Cousin's even has eggs. Great location...check it out! I just had their daily special--on Saturday. Love it."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Quizno's and this location in particular isn't great. The service is always subpar. When we approach the counter I always feel like I'm bothering them. They barely utter a word of greeting and can't seem to be bothered to even crack a smile or ask if we're ready to order. On every occasion I have been here I have to start the interaction which is a little annoying. We came here recently because I'm a Groupon addict and I just can't seem to resist. I'll stick to Firehouse Subs and Subway in the area instead."}
{"text":"I absolutely love quiznos all the ones in my area went out of business so this is a rare treat to go here honey mustard chicken sandwich is one of my favorites please support your local quiznos there a rare gem can't go wrong with the steak subs eather. The subs are a bit pricy compaired to subway but make up for it in quality and simply having something out of the ordinary. The rosemary bread is really good nobody else offers this quality of subs. Staff was extremely friendly and the owner gave me a free drink when the credit card machine was down and I had to go to the atm."}
{"text":"I wasn't fan for a long time. I was burnt out on sandwiches. But after my light-headed experience at the marriage bureau I was ready for some food. Ordered the Pesto Basil Chicken sandwich and fell back in love with a sandwich. Very yummy! I love the small portions too. The perfect bite."}
{"text":"I remember the first time I came to this place the chicken carbonara was loaded with meat and flavor, so I thought I would give them a try since it's been quite a while. I should have gone somewhere else. The sandwich was light on meat and sauce, it was really dry and there wasn't much meat, the pieces of chicken I did get we're rubbery and disappointing. I should have remembered it for what it was, now that memory is tainted..."}
{"text":"Very slow the few times I have been. Right near work so it's convenient. I called in an order today only to find out no one knew about the order. I did not eat all day and was starving.I spent my entire 15 minute break in there and still walked out empty handed. They had already took down the online ordering system. This place is under new management and I can't imagine what it was like previously if this bad now. I will just be hungry because they are not worth a dime of my money and it's not convenient if I call in an order for no apparent reason and spend my entire break in there."}
