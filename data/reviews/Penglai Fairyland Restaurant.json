{"text":"I found the food to be confusing. Their menu is a mix of Korean and Chinese.  The staff got our order wrong and rather than admitting it, they reassured us that the powdered red stuff on top was shrimp and that the fish was bamboo (which it wasn't)...   We were not very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"If you are curious about name PengLai,  I am not sure if that was an intention from the owners but it is the name of the  place where Lu bu met his love in \"Romance of Three Kingdoms\". anyways, I was skeptical to try this place but It was not bad at all. I tried Korean-Chinese style dishes such as black bean noodle and spicy noodle with seafood, and yes it lacked the usual flavour of M.S.G!! but was still O.K like a well home made type of dish.   Service was good, place was clean and I would return sometimes."}
{"text":"Dining room was large, so we didn't have to wait in a line up @ 12:30pm on a Saturday for Dim Sum.  Service was good - everyone was friendly and attentive.  Food was great."}
{"text":"We use to go to Ambassador for dim sum all the time and did not know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised to find a pared down dim sum menu which was adequate.  There is something wrong with the service specially with the floor 'managers'. They misplaced our dim sum order, did not get request for soy sauce and had to ask for napkins because there were not any on the table.  The food, once we got it, half hour later, was good. I am guessing most of the chefs from Ambassador stayed as the items and flavours are from Ambassador. Overall the food was good and fresh.  The price seems to have increased from Ambassador... Guess they have to make up for the name change and the slight facelift.  A 'high end' experience, it is definitely not. The delivery staff seems very friendly, the floor managers need to be more attentive."}
{"text":"I don't know how they thought up the name, but I do know the kitchen is a magical place.  When I found out the Ambassador Restaurant closed, it was the start of my period of mourning. Driving by today, I looked over to see a new name on the old haunt.  It was a good thing that the word \"Restaurant\" was on the sign, or I would have thought it was, well, I don't know what it might have been. Anyway, my period of mourning is over.  I pulled up and spotted Raymond, the former top dog of the Ambassador and now major domo of PFR.  He recognized me immediately and brought me up to speed on the resurrection.  He showed me to a nice deuce by the expansive windows and handed me a menu that was as drastically renovated as the surroundings.  I ordered one dish, since I was on my way home for dinner.  A critical test, I chose the Seafood Treasure Basket, a deep fried crispy basket loaded with shrimp, scallops, squid and surrounded by snap peas and mushrooms on the plate.  The shrimp were plump and snappy.  the scallops were succulent and CLEAN! The squid was as fresh as it gets.  The mushrooms were meaty and tasty, with the generous landscape of snap peas, sweet and crisp.  The flavours are subtle.  I liked that the Ambassador didn't kill their dishes with overloaded sauces.  Every item on the plate had its own flavour, tied together with a light garlic glaze.  I asked Raymond about the kitchen staff.  He confirmed my suspicion that he did indeed have the original Ambassador chef!  He also gave me a tip:  Dim Sum on the weekends is the best time to go, since they just amp up the offerings at the same price!  Since I used to eat at the Ambassador twice a week for lunch and often for business dinners for years, I missed it greatly.  I don't get to Richmond Hill nearly as much, but I do make an effort to put in a regular visit.  Let me know if you want to get a group together for lunch--I'll be glad to join in!"}
{"text":"Held a Chinese Banquet dinner here in their private party room. Food was great, newly renovated and pretty, and service was excellent, they were very accommodating and everyone was very impressed with the food. Highly recommend their their sea cucumber soup and HK style lobster (with dried garlic), very different from the usual and exceptionally crispy."}
{"text":"They charge each person 60 cents for sauce which was already on the table when we seated....talk about hidden charges until we got the bill...this place is expensive for dim sum, small is $2.60 which barely anything on the menu is a small, $3.60 for medium and $4.60 for Large which hai gow was....and it wasn't even that good, we ordered 3 dim sums and one fried noodle that tasted horrible, the need was thick and chewy and noodles were all shredded up, all that came to $24.......even tho this place looks all fancy and shit, the food sucks ass, they must have hired some inexperienced chefs to make up for the lavish renovations.....oh yea and they say wifi is available, it doesn't work...."}
{"text":"Penglai Fairyland Restaurant serves a mixture of Cantonese, Lu and Korean cuisine..  It just got a little confusing for me to decide what to order..... But since my dinner mate is not really adventurous and cannot takes spicy at all.. We stuck with Cantonese set dinner for 2...yawn..  Banchan with 4 varieties were A ok. I definitely had better..  Our set dinner for 2 ($32) consist of:  Chicken mushroom spring rolls  Choice of chicken corn or hot and sour seafood soup  Diced Chicken with pineapple (canned one which I don't really enjoy)  Shrimp with Snow Pea  Food overall is not too good.. At least the dishes I tried.  Fortune Cookies and Oranges as desserts? I am really confused..  The layout is similar to Ambrassdor with private rooms that great to host gathering.  Lunch Specials from $7.50. I guess I will come back for that instead."}
