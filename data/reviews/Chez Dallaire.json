{"text":"Looking for some finely crafted cocktails? Search no further! Chez Dallaire is gem to have in the area. The level of knowledge and attention put into the service and drinks is very impressive. I was even informed that they make their own lemonade in house :) I ordered an Amoretto Sour and was given the option to have it made with or without egg whites. That was yet another sign of a place that treats cocktail making with the respect it deserves! Overall, great service, great drinks, nice atmosphere and a great place! Ps I did not try the food but I shall be returning!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good drink prices, and plays the hockey game on game nights! Really cozy little place. A gem in Pointe-St-Charles."}
{"text":"Let me begin by admitting that I somewhat biased when it come to this review. Chez Dallaire is just a couple of minutes walk from my house and there is currently no other establishment to of this kind that can meet this criteria.   So with that disclosure out of the way let me proceed. Chez Dallarie opened its doors in Pointe Saint Charles over the summer and offer a hipster type vibe in a nicely renovated atmosphere. Yes, you will see lots of shaggy beards here! When they opened they didn't have a sign for the longest time, but I recently noticed that a sign has been put up so I'm hoping that this is means that they are here to stay.   Chez Dallaire, offer everything that you would be looking for in a local watering hole of a slightly upscale nature. They have a good selection of beers and things to eat and snack on ranging from mac'n cheese to nachos and TV's to watch the hockey game. One warning for the non eaters of meat out there, the menu is geared towards the carnivorous.   I'm a big fan what can I say! Did I mention that it is around the corner from my place?"}
{"text":"Still so delicious!!  Love this neighbourhood gem, Cocktails outstanding!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a great cocktail bar with a neighbourhood feel. Staff always makes you feel welcome and their classic cocktail game is on point. Food is classic feel good food, but with a fresh feel. Does the job for a heavy night of drinking."}
{"text":"I really liked Chez Dallaire.   I popped in here for a couple of drinks with a good friend who lives really close to this bar. It seems like they have not been open very long, and they are currently applying for a licence to allow drinks outside...so for now, you need to grab a seat in one of the comfy booths, rather than taking your drinks out.  They have a few (pretty standard) drinks on tap, and a whole wall full of liquor, so I assume they can make cocktails as well. It looks like a clean, friendly London pub to me...until you reach the back wall where they have a deer mounted onto the wall!  The staff were all really friendly and it wasn't too pricy - what's not to like!?"}
{"text":"La Poutine était immangeable (beaucoup trop salée) et assez chère. Aussi elle ne contenait pas les ingrédients indiqués sur le menu (canard confit ). Lorsqu'informé à propos du sel le serveur à fait comme si de rien n'était."}
{"text":"I somehow missed the entrance of Chez Dallaire twice. This section of Wellington street is so quiet and unadventurous, spotting a pub shouldn't be very difficult task to achieve, but It seems this pub doesn't want to shine too much in the darkness. Chez Dallaire is cozy place, the bar is welcoming, the two rooms behind are comfortable for big groups and few booths behind offer privacy for couples. It seems the patrons are mostly local crowd, not surprising considering the fact the nearest metro station is more than few blocks away, but parking is really easy around. The food menu has nice options to snack on. The drinks list is pretty extensive, but why would you come off the beaten path at Chez Dallaire are the cocktails. Truly interesting mixes. Besides that our host was super friendly and explained with passion every cocktail we may wish to try. Chibuga-mule was refreshing and the Scotch Gomez (hockey reference confirmed) was a smokey inspiration. Although not on the menu the Bloody Caesar was procured as spicy as it should be, simple and good! Happy to have discovered one more bar that delivers cocktails with love!"}
{"text":"Outstanding bar a little off the beaten path in Pointe St. Charles.   Yet that is one of many things to love about this place. I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this place my own special secret. But after having a good selection of their food and signature cocktails, it would be unfair of me not to share this hidden gem with other foodies and cocktail connoisseurs.   Located on Rue Wellington, this is the only higher end establishment in this area of Point St. Charles.   The food menu is small but quite good. What they do offer they do well. I especially liked the Mac and cheese and the grilled cheese with smoked meat.   They have a varied beer and wine list but that is nothing compared to the pages honoring their selection of whiskeys and bourbons.   But these facts pale in comparison to the piece de resistance: the masterpiece that is their cocktail list.   Whoooo baby!  There are about 15 crazy good sounding cocktails on the list and I swear that each of the five I tried were exceptional. The Rosaline, the C'est sure!,   I'm not sure who the mixologist is who comes up with this cocktail list. Is it Hugo the owner or a team effort? Whatever they are doing, don't stop Chez Dallaire! You've got a winning formula!  The cocktail list changes every season so what you see offered in Spring changes for Summer, etc.   The staff here are all friendly. We had wonderful chats with all we encountered. Perfectly bilingual and ready to answer any questions.   Go here if you love fine crafted cocktails. Take your friends if you want to impress them with your \"in the know\" knowledge of the hidden gems of Montreal City. Just go, by foot, car, or subway. Just go!"}
