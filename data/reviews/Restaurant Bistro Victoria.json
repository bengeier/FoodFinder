{"text":"We went there to get a bite to eat about 10 minutes before their arbitrary end-time for lunch, and the owner, very rudely, yelled that if we didn't have a reservation, we'd have to leave.

Now, I can definitely understand being a lazy business owner with a captive audience in a tourist trap, and not wanting to make more money by serving more people. More power to you and your comfort taking precedence over money. Seriously. Good for you! But, don't be rude about it. Fake a smile. maybe throw in a \"desole\" or something. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Victoria was not a great experience.  The space is really nice, we sat on the patio overlooking the fjord.  The service was very polite.  The food was subpar.  I had a pasta dish - spaghetti with ros√© sauce.  The sauce was okay, but it strangely had green onions scattered throughout.  My boyfriend tried it and agreed that it wasn't bad, just unexpected for the description (he's Francophone).  

The real issue came with the up-sell of garlic bread and cheese for the pasta.  I said yes to both, not realizing that the cheese would be an additional charge.  When the BF said \"really? It's more for both I think.\" I cancelled the cheese but kept the garlic bread.  At no time did she offer to tell me what they might cost, nor did she really say they would cost more just \"Would you like to add extra cheese or garlic bread?\"

My French isn't great but it's good enough to get me around a restaurant, and it's the first language of the BF so we would have caught it if she had said anything more.

He had an \"all dressed\" pizza (Americans - just pepperoni with veg) and could barely eat it since it was so dry and yet magically also greasy.  We had asked if it would be enough for two and the waitress said \"no\", but it would have been plenty.

The bill.  I mentioned the garlic bread.  Guess how much it was for 3 small pieces of very garlic-y, very greasy cheese topped bread?  Did you guess OVER SIX DOLLARS??  No, of course you didn't because that would be crazy.  The pasta was $12.  

So with our one pizza, one pasta, one garlic bread, one soft drink and one small beer after tax, but before tip, our lunch was $44.72.

Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Victoria Bistro is located right next to the cruise port in La Baie, QC.  I saw a sign for ice cream located outside their place.  We were both craving ice cream so in we went.  Their ice cream place is right there when you enter the place.  We did not go into the dining area for the restaurant.

We both had Blueberry ice cream which costed us $2.50 each.  Got to say that it did taste pretty darn good.

I would go back again if were in the area.  Maybe next time we'd try eating at their restaurant also."}
