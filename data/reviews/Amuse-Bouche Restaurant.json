{"text":"I love the small size (intimacy) of the restaurant, the creative flare of the food and the reasonably-priced bottles of wine. However after reading the Yelper reviews, the whole experience just wansn't what I was expecting. Perhaps after so many 5 star little french restaurants, I have been spoiled. 
Amuse bouche certainly started off right with a basket of breads and a vegetarian amuse bouche of pumpkin seeds and white beans.  The wine was decent, but with so many bottles under $50, it's hard to go wrong. 
The appetizers at my table were the poutine with duck confit and the prawn ravioloi with scallops. The poutine frites are tiny like the junk food \"potato stix\". So, you never really got the taste of the frites with the duck gravy. The ravioli were amazing, but of the two scallops only one was perfectly cooked, the other over-done. 
The mains- pork tenderloin and gnocci- were just OK. The gnocci was a bit too soft. I like at least a little bite to it, but this was just falling apart in my fork. We were full enough we opted out of dessert, which comes as a platter of bite-size custards and mousses. 
So, while I wanted to love this place, the stars may fall."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more bummed out that a place like this is closing its doors. I ventured there with three girlfriends on Tuesday night. It was the perfect quaint atmosphere I had hoped to find. Since Tuesday night is $10 Tapas night, we stuffed our faces with a variety of options. The Chef there knows how to pack alot into the tiny Tapas portions. 

They have a $25 wine menu (separate to their main) and we took advantage of that selection. I must say, I was impressed with the quantity of Ontario wines showcased at this restaurant.

The service was absolutely brilliant and the restaurant was simply wonderful. 

I'm sad to see this place go."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere and fantastic food.  Unlike many of Toronto's high end restaurants, the chef's behind the place are in the place.  Your meal will be skillfully prepared by a couple of Toronto's top chefs.  As for the menu; order anything.  You won't be let down."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this restaurant is closing down at the end of the month. However, I had such a great experience here yesterday, I just had to yelp about it.

A lovely spot tucked away on a residential street. Great service - we had to wait a long time for our table, but the servers were very attentive, serving us wine and a free tapas plate while we were waiting outside. They even brought us some pashminas in case we got cold!

I was there for Tapas Tuesday and I thought this was a terrific deal - all dishes are $10, bottles of wine $25, and cheese plates $5. 4 of us girls split 4 dishes and a cheese plate with a bottle of wine. The bill? $20 each, all in (total $68 + tip) . Of course, it helped that we didn't have to pay for a complimentary dessert dish (also because we were waiting so long) and fish cakes (dish at the beginning), the amuse bouche and yummy bread.

Highlights were fish cakes, beef carpaccio and duck breast. But I enjoyed everything else as well. I also really enjoyed the amuse bouche, though i had no idea what it was.

It was so good I think I'm going to go back next Tuesday for their last tapas tuesday! They also have a very reasonably 5-course tasting menu for $40, which i may try next week.

The restaurant owners will be opening a new restaurant with a different concept soon so I'm looking forward to that!"}
