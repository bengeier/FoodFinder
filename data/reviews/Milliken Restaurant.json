{"text":"Order a burger combo meal. Burger was off as you can tell it was a frozen burger. After taste from the burger was off. Will not order a burger again.  However the fries were good."}

{"text":"I've only had breakfast at this restaurant.  Eggs, bacon, potatoes all seems like health food, totally non greasy. I've been going to this restaurant for many years.  New ownership, thank goodness.  Love the food, I will always go back."}
{"text":"Family-run business that serves all-day breakfast and lunch. Located on the corner of commercial businesses.Breakfast includes your usual eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes and French toast. Served with home fries and toast. You can order in any combinations.  There are daily lunch specials, but the menu includes gyros, souvlaki, burgers, salad, sandwiches and soup.   Came here to try the breakfast as I always see them packed. Ordered the Milliken -MEGA-breakfast ($8.75) that includes 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips, 2 peameal bacon, toast and home fries with a side of pancakes ($3.25). Luckily, this is to share as I don't think I would be able to finish all of that in one sitting.   My scrambled eggs were delicious. Though I would have expected 3 eggs to have a lot more, but it turns out to be small eggs. Not a fan of bacon, but the sausages and peameal bacon were very tasty. Pancakes were thick and fluffy, though on the dry side. Well, that's why you soak it in maple syrup!   A good place for some traditional and comforting breakfast. Breakfast doesn't have to be fancy like Cora's, as long as it hits the spot and gets you going throughout your day.  Note: Opened Mon - Sat (6:30am - 3:00pm) and closed on Sunday. Free coffee, tea, or hot chocolate refills before 11:00am."}
{"text":"My first time coming to this local diner, passed by it so many times so I figured I'd give it a try.  Typical dinner food that serves all day breakfast with free coffee, tea and hot chocolate till 11am.  The breakfast is a safe bet, food is great, love the homemade potatoes, however kinda found the bacon a bit too salty, however after all, it's bacon.  Definitely a place you can stop by if you're around the area and wanting to catch a bite.  They're opened usually till 3pm...small, cozy, busy, but serves traditional foods. Would have given a 4star but it's a 'serve yourself' type of place.  The owner comes around to serve coffee, and pick up plates when its quiet...."}
{"text":"Warm, welcoming family run place. Restaurant not in an area where you would typical find restaurants.  You walk in and order at the counter. The staff will call you when the order is ready.  I ordered the cheese burger and upgraded to onion rings. This was a combo and came with a drink (pop or small carton of milk). The cheeseburger was laid out in an artistic manner - face up, 2 large slices of pickles, ketchup and mustard      in a perfectly laid out grid. Patty was not dry. Onion rings were deep fried in fresh oil - not burnt and golden.  All in all, decent price and great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Ordered the large breakfast special for $10.95. Firstly, let's talk about price. I don't mind paying $11 for a killer breakfast, but this is your run of the mill average grease spoon. Breakfast a few blocks away at Tom's is much better in terms of taste, portion, price and quality: $4.95. Service at Toms is also much better. The think that irked me the most about this place was the quality. The Peameal was old and on its way out showing some shades of blue. I didn't touch it."}
{"text":"Definitely satisfied my breakfast craving.  Staff: Friendly and seem to be very aware of their guests. I think many people were regulars so they were more attentive to them. There's not much to service since you have to go up to the counter and grab your own food when your name is called.  Ambience: I will say it is more of a cafeteria feel, since you have to order and then grab your tray. But there's newspapers off to the side for you to borrow to read and plenty of natural light. Don't expect too much in terms of ambience though.  Food: I got the Milliken Mega-Breakfast. The eggs were great, the sausage and bacon were made to my liking. It was just a good breakfast! I will say that I wish they had freshly squeezed juices (rather than bottled drinks).  I'd come back for a breakfast fixin' since it's so close to me!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly busy on a weekday brunch, despite the office/commercial location. Expansive menu of diner favourites with very reasonable prices. Staff are super friendly and apparently the washrooms are very clean.  I opted for the souvlaki plate with fries, salad and rice. The tzaziki came in a disappointingly small container, but everything tasted great. The dressing also came in a little cup to poor onto your salad. Garlic bread was bonus, wish it was softer though. Souvlaki was freshly grilled, juicy and definitely not overcooked like a lot of other places do.  Would come here again."}
{"text":"This is where I get my daily coffee for the past 7 yrs... Love it. $1 can go no wrong (if ur not a regular they will charge u tax). i also like to order the chicken burger combo w/ a soup. monday's soup is usually a cream soup, while the rest of the week varies.. most often it is chicken noodle w/ rice, veggie, etc.   i find the breakfast a little too oily for me (watching weight) but also tried the chicken souvlaki, grilled cheese sandwich here. not too bad! :)"}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch and the whole family loved it. Could find something for everyone, DELICIOUS. Under new ownership , super friendly staff, makes you feel welcome. Will go back for sure. Great value and love they are open long weekends. Favourite!"}
{"text":"We came back 2 times in the past 4 months and it's not so good anymore. The potatoes are now no longer consistently fresh, but more like the frozen fried type of homefries, and the bacon quality has gone down."}
{"text":"Milliken Restaurant is a good choice if you work in the area and you want to grab a quick coffee or lunch.  It does have a nice and friendly family vibe... My chicken souvlaki in pita bread ($6.95) is not bad but taste a little bland and oily...  The set up is self serve style like in a fast food joint, but at least you have real cutlery and real plates.  Personally, I think they should do something about all the dirty trays and dishes that piled up on the side in full view...  Don't go out of your way to come here but if you are around the area maybe come for their daily specials."}
