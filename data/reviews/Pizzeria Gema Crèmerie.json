{"text":"Ok, I really wanted to LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I had heard sooo many great things! I read Sarah Musgraves article in the Gazette that promised so much...but...my friends and I were kind of disappointed. I will grant them the delicious pizza crust- great, taste! However, the toppings for vegetarians is not that inspiring-- we ordered two pizzas that we couldn't tell apart. The winner was the mint and 4 cheese pizza.
Don't bother getting the salad there...seriously it was the smallest plate I have ever received for $8! It was just lettuce, some fennel and red onion (not like the description in Sarah Musgraves article either so was disappointed) But we were forewarned by our waiter when we asked if it was \"shareable\"- he said it was small..I just didn't realise he meant two bites worth small. I always appreciate a good pizza place that has a generous salad I can eat along side the pizza, like Pizzaoile's big salad with chickpeas, eggs, swiss cheese in it. Regarless..we found the wine was delicious (Syrah by the botte) and our waiter (Olivier) was AMAZING, the atmosphere was lovely too- we just weren't WOWED by the pizza like we hoped to be. Oh lastly, you have to get the custard for dessert!!! We got the chocolate with bacci topping (upon waiter's recommendation) it was deelish!!!"}
{"text":"i think i fell victim to being far too over-excited about this place.
having worked in a couple of pizzerias (both thin crust--neapolitan and purveyors of our canadian bastardization of the grease wheel alike) there are some crucial elements that i am unrelenting on. 

our salad to start was nice-- market sourced and went well with the arancini--

the pizza-- not the most complicated by any stretch, but not a margherita had a cured ham and vegetables. the problem was, all of the vegetables were placed on the ham and either a) slid off, or b) formed pools of water that then soaked through the dough. the dough itself has extremely salty (though im willing to chalk some of that up to the ham), and not nearly cooked enough in the middle to maintain the semblance of rigidity (i wasnt expecting a one hander, but when it \"mushes on the fork\" as opposed furls, there's a slight problem). 

im willing to give it all a second shot, just because i want to like this place more than i did but perhaps im better served trying somewhere else out first for my thin crust fix."}

The two of us had showed up the day before at 830pm on a Friday and we're refused seating because we didn't have reservations. We were sad but made reservations for the next day at 7pm, only spot available was at the bar. The service was quick and courteous despite the full house, but we were disappointed that our bartender didn't bother to tell us the specials of the day. It was only after we ordered that we noticed the mini chalkboard menu. I had the Emilia pizza (held the lardo) and a few bites of my partner's Capricciosa pizza, as other yelpers have mentioned, the crust was perfection. Thin, never soggy, slightly crispy at the bottom perfection. Of course we had to finish off with the frozen custard, we took the swirl with some Baci crumbs as toppings. Delicious. It's looks like soft serve ice cream but the texture is more consistent.
1 Emilia pizza 16$
1 Capricciosa 17$
1 frozen custard + 1 topping 6.50$
1 Sunny ginger cocktail of the day 8$
1 bloody Ceasar 8$
Total bill with 15% tip 73.39$

Overall I honestly have to say it was one of the very best pizzas I've had. The prices are very good for the quality of food that you get and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Je suis allée à deux reprises à la pizzeria Gema. 

Ma première expérience fut désagréable! Le serveur avait une attitude de vendeur et nous incitait fortement à commander plus d'entrées et à essayer leur fameuse crème glacée. Après de nombreux (!) refus de notre part, le serveur incitait toujours. Il était tout simplement irritant. 

Heureusement les pizzas étaient délicieuses! Le resto offre des pizzas plus traditionnelles et d'autres plus extravagantes (celle au prosciutto confit et poireau est particulièrement bonne!). Les calmars frits, en entrée, sont bons, mais une petite sauce en accompagnement aurait été appréciée. 

Nous avions tellement aimé la pizza que nous voulions y retourner, mais la possibilité de rencontrer le même serveur irritant nous faisait hésiter... Nous avons tout de même décidé d'y aller. Malheureusement, ce serveur était toujours présent, mais, heureusement, un autre employé nous a servi. Cette fois-ci, le service était impeccable! Nous avons essayé la crème glacée et elle est hallucinante! Le resto est également muni d'un comptoir à l'extérieur pour la crème glacée. Il est donc possible d'y arrêter pour prendre simplement une crème. 

Lorsque nous y sommes allés, il était impossible de réserver. Il faut donc prévoir un temps d'attente."}

The pizzas are all sooo good, the costarde glacée is delicious, and the service is always quick and super friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.
We were a party of 7 for a family birthday and were seated at a long table with a very friendly waitress who explained all of the pizza options in detail. Options are a mix of classic Italian pizzas and classics with interesting twists and all the ones we ordered (including a featured pizza with peaches) were delicious. Thin, crispy crusts and fresh ingredients.
Wine list is great with some really good and fairly priced private imports (including an organic montepulciano d'abruzzo that made my dad feel so nostalgic that he ordered 2 bottles!)
Staff was super friendly and sweet and prices are reasonable to boot."}
{"text":"Went with a friend 2 Tuesdays ago. We ordered the Yann pizza, yum! delicious, we both loved it, we also took Suppli Elena and Pallote Marcovecchio also mouth-watering & delicious. Service was attentive and on the ball.

The down sides were: the music was too loud, had to talk really loud to hear each other and the portion sizes leave much to be desired, the rice & meat balls were the size of a medium egg. We both loved the grated cheese garnishing the appetizers."}

TL;DR - Your money is better well spent somewhere else than here. Came for the custard, left without it and a ton of regret.

We made reservations via their website for 7 PM and arrived around 7:15 PM, after grabbing a scarce parking spot. Walked-in and was greeted friendly enough. The seating area is fairly small, I'd say about 40 max capacity. Our server sat my wife (who is 5 months pregnant) and I in-between a noisy family of 4 and an older couple. She opted for the chair while both our table and the older couple's table and to be moved out of the way (interrupting their meal) so that I could sit on the bench side.

With me being the designated driver and my wife being pregnant, we just opted for water with slices of lemon. We were given our water and lemon slices which had some weird sticky reddish stain on them from cross contamination.

We waited around another 15 minutes before the waitress decided to finally pay attention to the fact I had my hand in the air ready to order. She first asked if we wanted booze, which we declined, and ordered the calamari appetizer ($11, Calmars Frits) to start and a Vetri pizza ($19, homemade mortadella, pecorino, pistachio pesto, quebec mozzarella di bufala) to share. She asked again (almost in disgust) if we wanted booze, which we declined again. In a huff, she grabbed the two wine glasses on our table and took off to the kitchen.

After about 15-20 minutes of waiting, our appetizer arrived. It was decently portioned and just enough for the both of us to share. It came with a couple of lemon quarters and no sauce. The batter was light and the calamari was cooked just right. We were pleased with the choice and was looking forward to the pizza.

Skip ahead 40 minutes, the couple seated 10 minutes after us was served 2 pizzas. The large group seated 25 minutes after us was served their 6 pizzas. The group sitting behind my wife also received their pizzas. The waitress said that they \"had\" to make the pizzas for everyone else first and mumbled the rest half-heartedly.

Another 15 minutes and our pizza arrived. It was about 8 inches in diameter, burnt on the bottom, soaked in olive oil, soggier than a dog in a typhoon and had toppings haphazardly thrown on top.

It tasted terrible. There must have been a whole garlic bulb in the pizza, the pistachios only added a nutty texture, the olive oil made the bread chewy, the cheese/meat couldn't overcome the garlic. If I was blindfolded and ate this pizza, I would have thought I was eating a pita bread that was soaking in a tub of garlic oil and olive oil for an hour. It actually made me want to have Pizza Pizza to help blank-out the memory of what I just put in my mouth. Hell, I would rather of spent $19 on a pita smothered in natto beans and durian with a shot of Buckley's cough syrup to wash it all down with. That bad.

Food aside, service was terrible. We got the impression they were only interested in serving larger groups and heavy drinkers. Not once did the server ask how our meal was going or apologized for anything.

After waiting around for 20 minutes with looks of disappointment on both our faces and a lot of annoyance. The server came back and asked if we were done with our dishes. Not out of common courtesy, no. She asked because she wanted us to pay and leave so a larger group could be sat down at the table. Instead, we decided to sit there for another couple of minutes, trying to decide if we wanted to give them more of our money for the dessert (frozen custard) we made the trip here for originally.

Because we didn't take-off. The server asked the couple beside us (who was in the midst of conversation and their meal) to get-up and move over.

At this point, we had enough and decided this place didn't deserve any more money nor patronage. So we paid and left (with no tip).

Stefano Faita and Michele Forgione are probably living it up somewhere sunny right now; as their restaurant and reputation turn into the stuff that was clogged/over-flowing in the toilet."}
{"text":"Cet endroit est hyper attachant, de par le petit local vu sur la belle et vivante rue Dante et aussi les serveuse sont sympathique et attachantes, nous reviendrions seulement pour les observer. 

Les
Pizzas sont bonnes, spécialement la Emilia."}
{"text":"Casual dining done well. We split a Jenn Special (pomodoro pizza with garlic), Impasto pizza, which included their homemade porchetta & a Jean Talon salad and squid entree. Everything was very good - although I must admit I prefer the pizza dough at Bottega. The wine was also very well priced and best of all the frozen custard swirl was divine. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Previously to this review, I had written another review about Gema from my first visit a few months back. To which the restaurant had left me a sour taste to my mouth and didn't plan to return again. 

Fast forward to six months later, and I kind invitation for dinner from the chef/co-owner of the restaurant due to my very disappointing review. My opinion and, experience at Gema has changed.. For the better! 

We've arrived on a Saturday night at 6pm. Which the restaurant had a few clients already. Always a good sign! 

We sat down at a lovely small table. Soon after we began our meal with a very refreshing, colorful, tasty appetizer. Heirloom tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, with a few leaves of green and purple basil.  Oh my! It screamed freshness, and flavor. Which normally fresh mozzarella tends to be on the bland side, not at all in this case.  I was quite happy that they didn't use any vinaigrette to add flavor. Nothing like a bite of fresh, juicy, ripe tomato with a light drizzle of a flavorful olive oil on a sunny afternoon. 

Gema's main focus is their pizza.. My main focus was obviously going to be on their pizza as well. Which once again, another dish I was very pleased with. 
We've ordered a pizza which did not consist of a tomato sauce, which I was skeptical about. We all like tomato sauce on our pizzas, right? Take my word for it, our pizza certainly didn't need it since it had the following ingredients: Blue cheese, pistachio based pesto, and house made mortadella. Yes! They make everything themselves, and my taste buds loved that very much. I always have a strong focus for restaurants that can make as many things themselves as possible. Luckily, I was in the right place since Gema's strongly focuses on that.
Once our pizza was brought to our table, it was served very hot, and crusty. To which I couldn't wait to take a bit out of it. I was worried that due to the cheese, pesto, and mortadella it was going to be dripping in grease. Not at all. This is where good quality ingredients shined rather than showing off with drips of grease. To which I hate!
The pizza was quite salty.. Having said that.  Perhaps the combination of toppings didn't help. 

Now, desserts! 
Most pizzerias lack a variety of desserts  or have poor tasting desserts with inexpensive ingredients. Such as artificial flavors or fluffy fake whipped cream. Not at all the case for Gema. They are quite known for the frozen custard, and recently added to to their menu a completely homemade cheesecake, and their zeppole drizzled with Nutella. 

We chose the cheesecake and their frozen custard. 
The cheesecake was simply a bite of silky, creamy, smooth, perfection! Made with ricotta, and Philadelphia cream cheese. Of course with a buttery, crumbly graham cracker crust. Alongside a few sour cherries, to which in my opinion could have been left aside. Let the cheesecake speak for it's self. Since it was truly outstanding! Oh so creamy!
The frozen custard is quite similar to a soft serve ice cream, in the sense of texture.  In terms of flavor, it was superior to any soft serve. This is a vanilla bean based(You can see the specks and taste the strong true vanilla flavor) with an array of toppings. I chose the Belgium dark chocolate sauce. Since it's dark chocolate, it was a lovely contrast to the sweet, and  creamy frozen base. 

However, there were three minor flaws! Being a very sunny afternoon, I had the sun shinning in my face the entire time. Not that pleasing to eyes. I like to see the true colour of the food. Which sunglasses wouldn't let me if I had to wear them. 
 Unfortunately the rest of the tables were reserved so, moving was not a choice. In this case, I would suggest to the restaurant to put a thin blind or a thin curtain. 

The staff didn't seem to be communicating very well amongst each other that night. One of the staff members mentioned to us their specials.  Five minutes later we wanted to order some of the specials. We were informed that they were sold out of them. Which they were not aware of it. Oh ok?!
We were informed that we were only allowed to stay for two hours. Which is descent amount of time. I was a tad disappointed that we had a time limit since  the vibe of the restaurant along with the good selection of music was great, and lively. Would have loved to stay longer.
The chairs may not scream comfort, the tables may not offer you a lot of space either, while ours was a tad wobbly. 
 Having said all this, along with the minor flaws. I'm glad that this experience was far more impressive to my stomach, and eyes than my previous experience. Their strong focus on quality, and homemade ingredients made their meals shine and myself leaving with a smile from ear to ear. It's safe to say that I do plan on coming back. 
Thank you to Stefano, Michele, and their entire staff for a wonderful and delicious night! Looking forward in seeing all of you again!"}
{"text":"Bonne pizz, mais rien de marquant. L'entrée de polpette était bonne. Pour la pizza, on nous avait recommandé la pizza peperonni, mais on est resté sur notre faim. Le dessert toutefois est un MUST! On s'est régalé! Bon service, cool ambiance. Bon choix pour un repas pas trop cher à deux."}
{"text":"Overall, delicious and fun experience. Lovely service - friendly, casual, yet extremely professional. Absolutely amazing pistachio custard and cheesecake. I had a pizza with homemade pepperoni and fresh mozzarella - only wished that there was more cheese on my pizza. If you go with one other person, I'd advise sharing a pizza (as they are quite large for one person to eat) and several appetizers to get more variety."}
{"text":"Très bonnes pizzas. Ingrédients frais. Bonne liste de vins abordables. Les entrées sont intéressantes. Les deux fois, j'ai pris la pieuvre qui était dans une salade de câpres, oignons, patates. La pieuvre était croustillante.

Nous avons aussi essayé une salade de rapini qui était bien. Les calmars également.

Les pizzas sont faciles à partager et très bonnes.

L'ambiance est très plaisante. Le service est très agréable. Peut faire une belle soirée entre amis ou même un tête à tête semi-romantique. 

Il y a une petite terrasse. Nous avons attendu pour une table environ 20-30 minutes mais ça valait la peine.

Nous avons essayé des crèmes molles pour dessert et c'était moins intéressant. Une des glaces était une crème molle à la vanille avec arachides, mais avait un nom comme costarde glacée à la gousse de vanille avec noix rôties salées. On a aussi essayé une 2e saveur avec crème glacée twist et des miettes de chocolat. Au final, je vous conseille d'aller prendre un cornet ou un dessert ailleurs. Rien d'extraordinaire et pour 6.50$, on peut trouver mieux."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place. It seems like it is extremely hit or miss. I've been here and had an absolutely fantastic meal, but when I cam here last night things were definitely  off. To start with, I had made a reservation for 2 initially but called the staff that day and asked if it could be changed to 4 people. The host said that was not a problem and it would be for 4 when we came in....when we showed up they hadn't changed the reservation and we had to wait for them to adjust the table seating. Once we sat down we ordered some drinks. The girls had wine and the guys had beers. Our wines showed up but the server forgot our beers. By the time the pizzas came out and we still didn't have our beers the server finally realized she forgot to bring them. We even had to grab our own chili oil since our pizzas were getting cold.  TL;DR- REALLY awful service tonight. 

The pizzas themselves were actually really disappointing this time around too...which is a huge shame because I've had some lovely pizzas here. We ordered the Emilia, the Bob special and the Buca supreme. The Emilia had too much sauce so the pizza was extremely soggy, the Buca was nice but a bit overdone, and the bob special was very good but felt like it was missing some buffala. 

This was my 3rd time coming to Gema, but it was absolutely not up to the standards of the restaurant sadly. It's a shame they have a hard time with consistency here because when it's good...it's a great pizza. But at the price I'm paying for a pie (18-25$ each) it's not worth running the risk of whether I'll get a consistent pizza or not; Especially with such poor service."}
{"text":"I love pizza! And I loved the pizza here!!! This is a tiny little place that does not take reservations, so show up early (before 6) otherwise you'll be standing in a crowded little space, having to watch the seated diners enjoy their delicious meals! The pizza, as i mentioned, was excellent, as was the calamari and the salad. The frozen custard was good too but if someone told me i was eating ice cream, i'd have believed it. Not as custardy as i expected.
Go. You'll be happy you did..."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've had in Montreal yet. The crust is charred well with nice air pocket. If you appreciate good pizza, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Une belle surprise. Vraiment. Bon service. J'aime beaucoup la pizza Damman. J'y retourne"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Price is comparable to Bottega, its closest competitor. Service is slow and not very good. Atmosphere is wonderful

I would recommend going here if you want something trendy, tasty and have a lot of time to kill."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. They have mastered the art of pizza making, which I can't say is true for most pizzerias in the city. Their crust is light, crisp, firm and tasty and is the perfect vessel for their well curated toppings. I had the cacio e pepe pizza on their June menu and it was amazing... I hope it makes it to the permanent menu! 

Finished off our meal with a pistachio frozen custard and I was in love. I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"A ce jour, là meilleure pizza à montreal. Croute mince. Huile piquante aux habaneros. Service très courtois."}
{"text":"Location: Little Italy - on Dante, east of St. Laurent. It's also right across the street from Impasto! The closest subways are Jean-Talon and de Castelnau. Street parking is available and usually easy to find if you dine early. 

The place: Small and intimate, lots of wood, a cool bar. I liked the space a lot. It's more casual than Impasto.

The food: If the name hasn't given it away already, this is a pizza joint, and therefore, you go for the pizza - un point, c'est tout.  Forgione offers up a few different varieties of pizza - not too many so that you feel overwhelmed and not so few that you feel like there aren't enough choices. We started with an order of suppli that were on par with those I had in Italy. These were delicious and you could really taste the cheese, which was of a smokey variety (I forget the name). Now for the pizza: My pick was the pizza of the month - they had me at pistachio pesto and home-made mortadella. The scent of the meat wafting into my nostrils practically had me salivating before the waiter set my plate down on the table. I couldn't wait to dig in! Unlike some of the other reviews, my pizza didn't lack in toppings; the surface of the pizza was covered with mortadella, had the right amount of pesto and not too much cheese (how I like it). The crust was fresh and thin, and the overall pizza was absolutely delicious. I would definitely have this again. My date had the Bari - tomato sauce, Zampina sausage, rapini, cheese. Now, her pizza was looking a little bare and it definitely could have used more sausage. Flavor-wise, it was good but not as tasty as mine. I should mention that Gema make their own pepperoni and sausage as well as the mortadella, and it shows (or tastes, in this case).

The waiter basically hustled us into getting the frozen custard for dessert. No idea if they were other dessert options because he kept ignoring my request to see the menu. After boasting that Gema was the only place in town with frozen custard, blah blah blah, I finally just ordered the damn thing. Both my date and I shared the same thought - this tastes exactly like ice cream. So when my date pointed this out to the waiter, he replied 'well it's ice cream!' OK, so which is it? Custard or ice cream? Anyway, I don't normally order ice cream for dessert because frankly, it's ordinary and I can have that anywhere, anytime. The home-made Baci that topped the custard/ice cream/frozen thing was great. 

Service: I'm on the fence here. We were seated quickly and were well attended to - our water was topped up regularly and the wait staff checked on us regularly. However our waiter, though very good at his job, gave off a little attitude that just occasionally rubbed us the wrong way. Not enough to dock stars, however. Overall, the service was good.

Price point: Wine, shared appy, pizza, custard/ice cream/frozen thing + macchiato ran me $37."}
{"text":"Only writing a review based on their custards(ice cream). We passed by on a Sunday night just to try out their ice cream. We had dinner in the area and I needed my sweet fix and this was the first place I found on Yelp. I called in advance just to make sure I can just pass by and grab ice cream(I felt weird just getting ice cream, the place seemed more of an intimate sit down restaurant) and the guy on the phone said it's alright as long as it's for to go since there were no vacant tables.

I got a vanilla and hazelnut twist topped with some kind of crumble. The hazelnut was amazing!!! Best hazelnut ice cream I've ever had. You can see little bits of hazelnut and the \"custard\" was very creamy. 

Definitely going to come back for the food."}
{"text":"For a quick mediocre pizza, this place is pretty ok. I would have given a 2/5 for my own pizza (Bari) but my companions enjoyed theirs slightly more (3/5). 

The crust is too thin and lost its softness in the dough. Consequently, it burned the outter crust. I've had must better crust and true Italians know that a good pizza is ALL about the crust. 

The topping variety was pretty good, not much choice for vegetarians though. Hope you like pizza margherita. 

The restaurant was accommodating. We dropped in and they had reservations in 30 minutes but allowed us to have a pizza if we could be done by the time the reservations came in. Also, saw them conjure up a chair to squeeze someone in at the bar. Nice. 

Inexpensive and a good place to drop in when everything else in little Italy is full. ;)

Also, they ARE open on Sunday. Yelp shows them as closed."}
{"text":"I really like pizzeria Gema and would give it an additional half star if I could. The pizza flavour options are really unique and well thought out. The only issue I have ever had is that, at times, my pizza was overcooked (so crispy, it borderland on cracker). The custard is also a great dessert and I have been known to grab one at their take out window during the summer."}
{"text":"The pizza was fair, the hot oil made it much better.  Service was very very slow. Two tables received their pizza long before we received ours that arrived after we did."}
{"text":"Je n'ai jamais été une grande amatrice de pizza. J'ai grandi avec les Délissios à croûte beaucoup trop épaisse et les thin crusts qui goûtaient le carton sorties du four. Sinon, il y avait toujours les pizzas froides de l'épicerie sur lesquelles on rajoutait du baloney et du fromage marbré. Ou les fameuses pizza pochettes, qui annonçaient systématiquement une langue brûlée au 3e degré pour les 8 prochaines heures. Au final, j'avais goûté à de la pizza dénaturée de toutes les manières possibles, mais jamais à de la vrai pizza. C'est là où Gema change tout.

Voisine du fameux Impasto, restaurant italien sous la direction du même chef, cette petite pizzeria se loge dans la petite italie, proche du marché jean talon. Avec tout l'émois que son ouverture avait causé, ma nature curieuse n'en pouvait plus d'aller goûter à ce qui devait être ''la meilleure pizza italienne de Montréal''. Le soir de ma fête on se déplace assez tôt pour arriver avant les foules (ils prennent les réservations maintenant, je vous recommande de passer un appel!), et le coup de foudre eu lieu. Quelques dizaines de chaises sans plus, des serveurs souriants, une atmosphère chaleureuse et l'odeur de la pâte fraîchement cuite. Une belle carte des vins, des bières québécoises (dont une bière maison rafraîchissante!) et un menu court mais efficace. Ils ont également un chef invité qui, à chaque mois, vient concocter une pizza signature. La première fois où j'y ai été, nous avons eu droit à Martin Picard et sa pizza au foie gras et tortellinis. L'autre, le Moishes nous offrait une pizza au carpaccio de smoked meat. Mais ne vous inquiétez pas, les pizzas du menu régulier n'ont pas à rougir face à ces créations éphémères. Par contre, une fois en bouche, qu'est-ce que ça donne?

La première mordée nous régale d'une croûte mince et savoureuse; molle, tendre, imbibée des saveurs de la garniture. Si délicieuse, qu'on en mange même les croûtes. Les calmars frits en entrée sont sublimes; croustillants et savoureux, encore plus avec un trait de jus de citron frais. Et que dire du dessert... Une costarde glacée de la Laiterie Chagnon, onctueuse vanille ou laiteux chocolat, qu'on assaisonne de garnitures italiennes sucrées. Presque tous ce qui est sur la carte est fait maison; Croûte, viandes, charcuteries, sauces, pestos, légumes marinés... j'irais même jusqu'à croire que le seul produit acheté est le fromage (et encore). De ce fait, lors de votre prochaine envie de pizza, au lieu d'ouvrir votre congélateur, laissez-vous impressionner par leur pepperoni fromage. Elle est à des miles de la Delissio congelée, promis juré."}
{"text":"En s'écartant des adresses plus touristiques, cette pizzeria est une réussite. Pâte fine, ingrédients maison autant que possible, du goût et un prix raisonnable. L'ambiance est chaleureuse mais la salle est souvent pleine, réserver est plus sûr en saison pleine."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is simply the best pizza in Montreal. I cannot get enough. The shandy with the lemons is a great drink as well. Finish the meal off with the frozen custard. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Love this place.?"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Little Italy. It's reasonably priced, the space is nice, and the wine is impressive. 

This is definitely third wave pizza."}
{"text":"Superbe nouvelle petite pizzeria dans la Petite-Italie, allez-y, c'est si bon. J'y étais un midi en semaine, et c'était plein à craquer. Et pour cause; la pizza est délicieuse! Pour 21 $, tu peux commander la table d'hôte qui inclut une entrée, une pizza et une costarde glacée. Pour les plus petites faims, il est possible de ne commander que 2 services pour 18 $. 

L'entrée : il y avait le choix entre des calmars frits et une salade Jean-Talon (cute nom), qui était débilement bonne. De fines lamelles de betteraves couronnées d'un fromage maison incroyablement goûteux. L'eau me vient à la bouche rien que d'y penser.

Il y a 4 choix de pizzas, j'en ai goûté 2. La 1889 est une margherita toute simple mais magique; ma préférée. La Impasto est au piment fort et porchetta; très bonne aussi.

Et pour terminer, la oh-combien-délicieuse-j'en-mangerais-toute-ma-vie costarde glacée. Comme une crème glacée, mais en plus soyeux et goûteux. Grand choix de garniture, on a suivi la recommandation du serveur et c'était sublime. Il est également possible de la prendre pour emporter, il y a un comptoir donnant directement sur la rue St-Dominique.

Mention spéciale à la déco épurée mais tellement intéressante. Je n'ai pas été surprise quand j'ai su que c'était Zébulon Perron qui a signé le design.

C'est wow, j'y reviendrai c'est sûr."}
{"text":"A gathering of Yelp friends brought us here before a Yelp event and it was a blast!

I'm generally not a fan of chaotic pizzas with too many toppings so I went with their safe \"1889\" Pizza that consisted of the basics + basil and it hit the spot quite nicely. The crust was fresh and tasty, the ingredients were very good and all in all a really solid Italian pizza. They offer Brio so that's a plus, at least for me. For dessert I went with their cappuccino as well as their chocolate gelato and both were very good.

The resto is small but warmly decorated. It is located near busy St-Laurent and Little Italy... so expect parking to get interesting in this area. 

The service was friendly but the dining experience did take longer and I would have liked and I would have appreciated if I were asked if I wanted another drink or not.

In conclusion, one cannot deprive themselves to such a unique experience one can get at Gema. Italian pizza AND gelato? Why are you still reading this review? Bookmark it and experience this yourself."}
{"text":"It's so unfortunate that such a highly hyped place can ruin a night out. Let's begin with the dining area the size of condo living room. They try to cram too many people in, I was hunched over a strangers table while we ate. You can't move your chair back for fear that you cut off the only tiny space for the waiters to move. The fact that the menu is short is refreshing but they were real jerks about any modifications, even though some of our party had an intolerance or allergies. The pizzas arrived with half the bottom sides burnt, not dark but burnt, the waiter's explanation was that it's how they cook them for the woodsy flavour. Then why was only have the pizza burnt to a crisp? And what's \"woodsy\" to them - tasted a lot like burnt charcoal to us. Dessert was disappointing, who screws up chocolate ice cream??? And finally we were reminded, kindly, but still reminded that we needed to leave so they can turn over the table."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but I was not impressed with the service. My friend and I were moved to another table (in the MIDDLE of our dinner) to make room for a larger group. We were basically told that we would have had to leave if it were not for the availability of this other table. FYI: When making a reservation on their website, it clearly states that the table is allowed for a period of 2 hours. Thanks for the favour, Gema!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this place based on the food. Their pizza is really amazing. I had the buffala pizza, and it's something I now crave on the regular. 
The dough was light and not heavy on the stomach. The cheese was all over the pizza, well spread out and in every bite. 
The food is probably one of the best in little Italy. 
I would hands down pick this place over Napoletana any day.
The only negatives I could think of are the acoustics of the place, it gets quite loud but not a big deal. And the service is a little lacking.
I don't know names but one guy in particular, young guy, was excellent and gave us wonderful service. But the other handful of times that we went I wasn't all that impressed with the service. 
But again. Best pizza."}
{"text":"3 service lunch is $21 and crazy delicious, which is why there was a lineup of people at 11:57 on a sunny Thursday afternoon at this beautiful corner in Little Italy waiting for the restaurant to open at noon.  It's a beautiful room with friendly charming service and awesome cocktails. We shared the Jean Talon Market salad of the day, which was mostly bright beautiful delicate beets with a scoop of homemade ricotta so good we were moaning with an awkward intensity, but so were most people around us so it was cool. 

We had two pizzas, the Impasto and the Gema version of the classic Margherita. The crust is the best in town, so there's that. It's buttery and light and crispy and everything good. The Impasto has these fresh hot still crispy red peppers, and thin garlicky slices of pork. I don't know what else to say about the pizzas, it makes me emotional, just go get some. 

Third we had the frozen custard, creamy and light and drizzled in caramel sauce. Full five stars, crazy good, what else can I say."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. 

It's a cute little pizzeria that looks like it's a neighbourhood joint. The decor is quaint inside and out. We made reservations for 530pm since we had a party of 7 including a baby and 2 year old. 

Waiter was friendly and gave decent introductions to the menu. Pizzas came out quick and service was good. 

The food was delicious. The dough was light and just the right texture. Tomato sauce and flavours of toppings on pizzas were noticeably different (in a good way) and delicious. The portion was great. They call it personal sized pizzas but I think we could've shared 1 pizza and just added 1-2 appies (to feed 2 adults and 1 child) which we will try to do next time. Price was great too for what it was. 

We are actually going back tonight before we leave Montreal to try it again. Going to try their ice cream this time!"}
{"text":"Being a pizza connoisseur, it's always very difficult for me to find a proper new pizzeria in Mtl, but Gema managed to surprise me... It was one of the better pizza I've had in a while.  Pizza dough is light and chewy, sauce is fresh and balanced, and almost everything is done in house (ie: pepperoni). The calamar was nice and light and not overly fried.  A highlight for me was the custard ice cream topped with caramel and nuts... It was excellent (they usualy have baci toppings, but they had ran out).  The staff and owners were very friendly and made our evening even more enjoyable (hat tip to Stefano).  The only downside - located in a small local and not taking any reservation, expect to wait a while before getting seated... But don't worry, it's worth the wait!  To the whole staff at Gema, keep up the good work!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Une pizzeria sympathique sur Little Italy. Il y a un large choix de pizza, qui sont faites au feu de bois. J'ai opté pour une Capricciosa, elle était très bien, et la pizza est assez grosse pour repartir repu. Mes amis ont également beaucoup aimé la leur, c'est plutôt bon signe. Rapport qualité/prix correct. Le personnel est plutôt jeune, et accueillant."}
{"text":"Gema delivered exactly what I expected as service, under-delivered in terms of pizza quality and I have to admit the frozen custard was really enjoyable. Group of seven, reservation at 7pm on Saturday and firm warning, when our friend was doing the booking that we have the table only until 9pm. So we started reading reviews and were kind of prepared to be kicked out exactly at the time specified yet hopeful that won't happen. Service is leisurely distracted and the logic behind it tough to comprehend. We knew some drinks will be forgotten and were looking after each other making sure everybody has beer or wine. Why the food orders were collected way after all the explanations about the specials and knowing we have limited time I can't explain. At least our dishes arrived swiftly. The Jean Talon salad certainly can be rated five stars, seasonal veggies with perfect dressing. My companion and I opted for the special pizzas. Excited to have zucchini flowers as  an ingredient I chose something that lovers of traditional pizza shouldn't choose. One of my friends exclaimed that the pizza looks beautiful and yes it was with all the fresh colorfull baby tomatoes, tiny zucchini and their orange blossoms, but it was soggy in the middle and veggies were less cooked as they should be. At least the slightly improved version of the very classical 1889 was good enough, very nice crust, but in the end nothing exeptional. At 8:40pm our plates were cleaned and we nervously started looking around if we will get a dessert menu. Fortunately we were lucky to get our frozen custard served quickly and enjoy it while paying the bills. So by 9pm we are done and exchanging last sentences almost ready to leave. At this time a member of the personnel we haven't seen so far appears and reminds us we must leave as the table is reserved. Ok, so it is true. There is nobody yet waiting for our table, we just paid the bills and they are kicking us out at the time we have been thoroughly warned about. As one of my dearest friends mentioned afterwards that leaves a bad taste even if you had a pleasant time at the rstaurant. Considering the reservation handling policy and the pizza quality I don't plan to visit Gema again. I would certainly show up at the take away window for frozen custard as it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, great price and great service. The pizza, was very good. The selection of options is great in a pizza competitive corner of the city. The dough is no Bottega (sorry) but everything else is great. The prices are very good too. Last but not least is the ice-cream of course. No need to mention it - killer."}
{"text":"Just okay. Nothing terribly bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try Gema again. Mediocre pizza. I have definitely had much better pizza especially at an average of $20 per pizza. The few pieces of octopus in our salad were super tough and the salad overall lacked flavor. We were willing to try dessert but after 30 minutes of trying to get the server's attention we took our opportunity to get the bill and left."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! 

If you love pizza and want to finish your meal with ice cream, it's the place to go.  Everything there is amazing.  And an added bonus, the service is great!"}
{"text":"Love Gema. Super cute place with delicious pizza and custard Ice cream with a lot of selection for interesting toppings. The service is fast and the quality is superb ! One of my favourite pizza places in Montreal. It's also nice that you can order from a little window on the side walk :)"}
{"text":"After hearing that Michele Forgione and Stefano Faita were teaming up again to bring Montrealers a pizzeria I was eager to try it.  Gema is a small restaurant right next to their other venture, Impasto.  It has a very casual feel to it and is a perfect place to come on a night when you're not up for anything super fancy.  The menu is limited to the basics (salads, appetizers and pizzas) but they focus on doing them well.

There is a decent variety of pizzas here and they do them well.  I went for the Impasto which had porchetta, peppers, porchetta and salsa verde.  I loved the flavour that the cacciocavallo added however the porchetta was way too salty for my liking.  Their crust is excellent!  They do a thin crust pizza which is my personal preference.  Tet the right balance between ingredients and crust so that it doesn't become soggy and fall apart.

As with the rest of the menu when it comes to dessert they have a limited but delicious menu.  They usually have a dessert special and frozen custard.  You can choose from vanilla, Belgian chocolate or a combination of them for the frozen custard.  They also have a variety of toppings you can get on the custard like Baci crumble, chocolate sauce, etc.  I enjoyed the swirl quite a bit but in the end the chocolate custard won out as my favourite!

The prices were competitive compared to other pizzerias in Montreal.  My bill was close to $40 but that was for pizza, dessert, cocktail and tip.  I certainly felt that I got my money's worth coming here.

The service was fairly good.  Our waitress was very friendly and made great recommendations for us.  She was also attentive throughout the meal.

Given how it's a small restaurant I would either try and go early or make a reservation.  We got there for 6 and it wasn't too busy but by the time we left business had picked up significantly.  It was also a Wednesday so I imagine weekends would be considerably busier."}
{"text":"Came for the pizza week special but was so impressed with the pizza of the day, I went with that. Our waiter so elgantly described what sounded at that moment like a damn classy pizza: thin crust baked with tomato sauce, pecorino, and mozzarella, pulled out of the oven and layered with thin slices of presciutto, and finally dressed with a few drops of 25yr old balsamic vinegar. While waiting I ordered an aperol spritz to enhance the romantic, Italian vibe. Our pizzas came not too long after.

The pizza, so beautifully presented, was overall a good pizza. The generous amount of presciutto justified the $24, and it was a heavenly pizza. I really enjoyed surprising myself with sweet bites of balsamic between salty bites of presciutto and cheese.

Though my pizza was great I think the girlfriend ordered the better one. The Menina: cooked spinach, onions, mozarella, pecorino, olives, and capers. For $15... Holy pizza! So fresh and original I cried inside. Great with the hot oil.  

Cute and romantic restaurant found on a pretty corner in Little Italy. The terrasse was a good choice given it was a beautiful evening. Enjoyable classic pizzas, with original Gema twists. Professional and knowledgeable staff. A serious GEMA of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's not my favorite pizzeria in Montreal but it's damn good! I've been here three times and I've always left feeling satisfied. This time I had the Vetri pizza which consists of homemade mortadella, pecorino, pistachio pesto and Quebec mozzarella di bufala . It was so good!! My boyfriend had the Hawaiian pizza which is also very good. I don't usually like Hawaiian pizza but the waiters all recommend it! It's the perfect mix of sweet and savory and a little bit spicy!"}
{"text":"Tout simplement le meilleur resto à mtl, la pizza est délicieuse, c'est la meilleure margharitha à mtl, c'est vraiment à conseiller, réserver avant c'est un must"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! I highly recommend their monthly specials with the recommended glass of wine. It is a bit of a wait to get your food, but once it comes it's really worth it. If you have a sweet tooth the dessert is incredible FYI"}
{"text":"Notre première visite , très déçu du service 2/12 hrs au Resto , vite sur le cocktail par après l entrée ,par après attente de la Pizza une bonne heure la Gem
Qui finalement avait peu de sauce de fromage et on a cherché l'ail , bref j ai du me lever pour payé

Merci"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in montreal.love the crusts,the toppings and their menu that changes every few weeks or so.love everything on the menu,especially their fresh jean talon market salad,the emilia rich mushroom pizza and the to die for custard with bacci topping.i am a vegetarian and they can make every pizza on the menu without meat.the service is friendly and efficient,the ambiance and is cool and relaxing where the good wine keeps flowing.with all the great pizza restaurants in montreal this is really my favorite,don't miss out on it!"}
{"text":"Gema is like that one movie that everybody talks about, but keeps on disappointing you. Well Gema is that \"50 Shades Of Grey\". The place is lovely, but the pizza and drinks are far from worthy. Christian Grey brought my ex-wife to climax more than both I or this pizza could ever do. The ice cream is ok, but a lot of people find it a bit too sweet."}
{"text":"Ever since Stefano Faita and Michele Forgione of Impasto announced their second project would be a pizzeria, I have been eagerly anticipating its opening. The level of craft showed from them at Impasto left me no doubts that their approach of pizza would worth the wait. Each instagram post from Chef Forgione of his test runs made me more and more excited as we saw the level of perfectionism in its purest form. This pizza would be no slouch. Finally, at long last, I could find out for myself. Pizzeria Gema opened up last month just across the street from Impasto in the heart of Little Italy making the corner of Dante and St-Dominique an happening culinary corner.

Gema itself is a relatively small restaurant - all of about 40 seats probably and they don't take reservations, so you may have to wait to get in. In our case, we waited about 30 minutes. The nice part is that they will take your phone number down and call you so you can go from a walk or grab a drink elsewhere in the meantime. If you prefer, there is a takeout window on the side where you order a pizza to-go or some frozen custard. The interior is sparse but clean - old wood panels on the wall, aged hardwood on the floors with a weird light \"tree\" in the middle of the room adding some color to the space. The other focus point is the bar with its marble countertop although I got a good laugh that the bar chairs are the same Ikea ones I have in my apartment. The space isn't a looker like its neighbour Impasto but that's not an issue for me.

The menu is small and concise. A few entrees, 8 or so pizza options and some frozen custard for dessert. As a starter, we went with the fried calamari. A nice portion of fresh calamari with a good crunch to them. They are served with a couple of lemon wedges, no mayo because they don't need any sauce to enhance flavour. The calamari have plenty of flavours all by themselves.

On the pizza side, we got 2 pizzas to enjoy. The first one was their basic \"1889\" margarita pizza with tomato sauce, fior di latte and fresh basil. The second one, because I am a huge meat-lovers fan, was the Giovanni Deluxe - tomato sauce, zampina, pepperoni, porchetta and lardo. Boy, did these pizzas not disappoint.... the pizza crust is just insane. Ridiculous. Whatever positive superlative you want to use applies to this dough. A nice crisp seer on the exterior without a single burnt spot to be seen.... and completely soft and moist inside. This level of dough mastery deserves the highest praise. Props to you Chef.

And we haven't even gotten to the toppings yet. The classic margherita was excellent - the tomato sauce was tangy, the cheese creamy and rich, the basil brought that freshness and the overall ratio on the pizza was excellent - none of the ingredients were too present or not present enough. As for the Giovanni deluxe: house made pepperoni, the porchetta from Impasto, zampina, lardo.... this pizza had me from the description. Great combo of fatty rich meats on top of the base margherita. Simply heavenly. I just wished it had been bigger so I could enjoy it some more.

Whatever you do however, make sure that you have room left for dessert because Gema has frozen custard... not ice cream but custard. The difference comes in terms of a richer, creamier texture which personally bought to mind a creamy version of Dairy Cream which hit childhood nostalgia for me every time. Gema has chocolate or vanilla so of course, we went with a twist of the two. There is also a handful of topping options - we went with crumbled baci, mixed nuts and butterscotch sauce. A perfect dessert for a pizzeria.

Once again, Chefs Faita and Forgione hit it out of the park. Gema is a wonderful addition to the pizza scene in Montreal and for me, is currently the champion hands down. That crust means business. If they offered delivery to the McGill Ghetto, I would seriously be a weekly caller. At present, I will definitely be a regular visitor because they are other topping combinations I need to try and that pizza is too good to pass up for too long. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was supposed to go at napoletana restaurant this day, but the waiting line was awful, so we end up going at Gems pizzeria and I'm super happy with my choice. Wow this was an amazing pizza ! One of the best I has in my life. The crust was soft incide and crusty on the outside. The ingredient was fresh est perfectly cook to be a little bit crisp.

I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and had a great time. The lizza was great and the atmosphere was great too!  The pizza nice and thin.  If you like spicy food then make sure to ask for the olio piquante."}
{"text":"Une des meilleure pizza que j'ai goûté à Mtl!! L'hawaïenne était particulièrement délicieuse."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with fresh homemade ingredients, delicious drinks (aperol spritz was fantastic!), and friendly relaxed service. Will be coming back soon to try the frozen custard."}
