{"text":"We have been here 3 times, take out once for dinner and sit down twice for brunch. The first thing I will warn you about is like many of our favorite places on Broadway, the star is usually one cook, and one host/wait staff. The service is as good as it can be within those limitations. Now, on to the food. Without a doubt, the dry rub wings are fantastic, crispy (no breading), bursting with flavor. None of the flavors including the Cajun are excessively hot. The Cajun has a nice mellow slow burn but not too hot.

This morning, I had the pork chop and waffles breakfast, which comes with eggs.  The pork chop was batter fried making it crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I cut it with the butter knife, so It was tender too. I hadn't planned on getting a waffle but the chef was cooking one for another customer and the sweet smell lured me in. It came with a large dollop of whipped honey butter. The waffle and honey butter were sweet enough for me but the also brought a small container of syrup. 

They also have a catfish and eggs breakfast which has very crispy catfish. This morning however, they were out of catfish, but had tilapia. Same crispy flavorful batter. 

My husband also ordered 2 tacos. They were filled with roasted chicken, lettuce, onions, and cheddar cheese. The tortilla was fried fresh. The taco could rival any street taco. 

So, if you have time to sit down or want to order ahead of time, I recommend giving Ewns2 a try."}
{"text":"For years, I was a semi-regular at the original Ewn's on South Central.  But I am happy to say that this new place is much better.  Its smaller than the original, but the menu is better, especially with the addition of BBQ.  However, the wings are my favorite still.  The moniker \"king of wings\" is definitely appropriate here.  The wings are large, juicy and flavorful.  My favorite is the honey hot and almost always my go-to dish, but the southern style are a close second.

I have had the BBQ  tacos, pulled pork and numerous sides as well.  The BBQ beef in the tacos was delicious and well smoked. The pulled pork, although not as good as my own ;-), was definitely top notch. 

To date, I have had the mac and cheese, cole slaw,  french fries and most recently the yams.  All are really good and came out piping hot (except the slaw).  The yams are by far my favorite; sweet and just a tad bit savory at the same time.  Try them, you won't be disappointed.

But what I enjoy the most, is the service.  I believe that the owners are John and his sisters (unfortunately, I didn't get their names). They are extremely friendly and happy to help out in any way.  When ordering take out, they always ask me to sit and even bring me water while I wait - something that I have rarely seen.  When dining in, they come by and chat (when its slower) and really go out of their way to make me feel like family."}
{"text":"I have tried a few items from there, Rib tips, fish, chicken, brisket its all good."}
{"text":"Well, I had occasion to eat there with my son and Mom on a Sunday a few weeks ago.  It is a smaller space, around 10-12 tables.  It was full with a steady stream of carry-out orders as well.  The young lady who was our server was Sweet and helpful!  Said it was her 2nd job on the weekends that she just did for FUN! Serving people for fun! Great!  We tipped her $8 on a $28 ticket!  One of the Owners kept walking around doing random checks on everyone.  I WAS THRILLED with the Sweet Potato Pancakes!  Very delicious and filling! The wings were Jumbo and I had them for lunch the next day. They also have a Sweet Potato Large Waffle which I plan to try next time I visit. My son actually had the \"Broadway Burger Meal.  I believe my mom had something like the \"Ms. Rubye's or Jessie Breakfast Meal. Everyone was happy with their selection. Football was on the mounted tv for the Football Fans! Parking is a challenge on some days as space is limited. Hopefully, with MORE PATRONAGE they will obtain a larger space to feed more people well!"}
{"text":"I really don't give a place below 3 stars but this place is not what I expected. General rule of thumb is I do not go into a place and eat if the parking lot is empty but for this place I made an exception because of the  reviews on yelp. To make a long story short I paid 15$ for my puppy to eat the brisket  was just a bunch of fat in really bland bbq sauce and the rib tips was gristle and fat my dog hercules loved it the greens we mediocre and the black eye peas were just mush will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Delicious food great company.  I had the smothered chicken, mac & cheese, corn bread, and sweet potato pie for dessert.  
We a great time talking to the ladies working."}
{"text":"No southern hospitality here!!!! Prices up quality of food down. Customer service there lack of."}
{"text":"Just had one of the best meals of my life here: the $10 Saturday special with two large, perfectly cooked catfish fillets, two whole chicken wings, addictive yams, and savory cabbage. I'll probably never know if the other food is that good, 'cuz I just want to repeat that meal, often as I can get there."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my meal, felt like I was at home ( yes it was that good) Loved the sweet potatoes, my fav, by far! Best home cooked meal in the city! Customer service is awesome, really felt at home! I have and will continue to refer my friends here!"}
{"text":"The Bomb!!!!! I had the Fish Dinner with Mac and cheese and Seasoned Fries with big cup of Kool-aid. Everything was AWESOME. My had the smothered chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans. The Bomb!!!!! My daughter had The Spare Ribs Mac and cheese and Cabbage and we all had cornbread!!!!! The Bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"This food is so good. Mac and cheese is the best I've had in a long time and chicken perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Maybe the other reviewers who raved about this place were friends and family of the owner. That's the only explanation that I've come up with. The place is small and run down but I wasn't too put off because the best food often comes from places like this. The air conditioner blew out hot air. Thank God it wasn't too hot out or this visit would've ended badly. When we entered we were told they had no chicken. Apparently they ran out on Sunday and as of Wednesday were still out of chicken. I had a Groupon that I'd bought 4 days ago and wanted to use it so I ordered the rib tips basket. The lady very politely said she didn't know if they were accepting groupons. I was very confused since it was still being advertised on Groupon and I'd just purchased mine a few days ago. She said ok that they would accept it and took our orders down. I asked what desserts they had and she told me none because they hadn't made any today. She asked if we wanted drinks then told us we could either have Kool-aid or she had 2 Dr. Peppers available. At this point I'm ready to walk out. Why are you even open when you don't have food or drinks like this?! The customers that came after us heard no chicken and left. They brought our food and it was ok. Just ok. The rib tips weren't dry or tough but they were lukewarm and I got the impression they weren't smoked. I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and say they were pre cooked and reheated. The catfish filets and pork chop my friends ordered were good they said. The portions were plentiful. I wouldn't return but I'll give them a star for plentiful portions and a star for friendliness."}
{"text":"Omg what a surprise treat he best French toast I ever had in my life and grits to die for!!! Clean and friendly. Real down to earth folks I was sad we couldn't have come back for their bbq."}
{"text":"Not on Sunday (too crowded for me) but I would go there every other day if I lived closer, TERRIFIC FOOD! GREAT STAFF!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I ordered the Sunday Special, rib tips, 2 whole wings and 2 sides.  Come with patience because meals are prepared to order; however, the food is worth the wait. We both agree the rib tips were excellent and the sauce was great!  The wings were seasoned well. 
My yams and greens were scrumptious, very well seasoned, my macaroni and cheese was okay, it would have been better if it had more cheese. 
Hubby had the potato salad and  the beans and rice.  He enjoyed both very much. Again, seasoning was perfect!

I highly recommend Ewn's 2. 
Overall The food and service deserves five stars. Portions are generous and glaciers are WONDERFUL!
their entrees. 
It's definitely a \"whole in the wall\" so go for the food and do NOT go expecting anything  fancy. They focus on the cooking, not the indoor eating area."}
{"text":"Under new management, but not necessarily better management. The old menu was a lot better than what's currently offered. Hopefully they'll expand the menu and offer a better variety. The catfish nuggets were good. As far as I know, the food is 4 star, but the lack of choices and increased prices compared to previous management drops them down to 3 stars in my eyes."}
