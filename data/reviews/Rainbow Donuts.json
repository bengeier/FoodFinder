{"text":"Got in line with my daughter when we observed the lady in front of us returning a few donuts. Expecting the donuts to go in the trash per food regulation, I walked out after seeing them being placed back with the other donuts to be sold (again)."}
{"text":"Love this place. Rainbow donuts -8714 n 7th St. I have to say, our family has tried other donut places and nothing compares to Rainbow donuts. They have the best testing donuts. They have a great selection of donuts to choose from. Our families favorite is glazed donut holes, tiger tail and glazed bear claw. The donuts are all fresh and delicious. Go and try Rainbow Donuts for your self. You will love them"}
{"text":"Not often is it that I wake with a crave for donuts. But man, today was something else! Yelped donuts, found this spot, drove on over, and even tried the BACON DONUT. Yes, you read correctly. It was aight :) I would have flavored the frosting differently, but won't bag too harshly for their brave experimentation. Oo! Speaking of donuts... I still have some left. Gotta go! :)"}
{"text":"Great you just have to get there on Sunday before early church gets out its a great shop and great service will be returning soon"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 2 times. While their maple bacon donuts are VERY delicious, both times I have gone to get a Ham and Cheese Croissant. It's right there on their menu- (http://www.rainbowdonutscafe.com/croissants.html). Yet both times they didn't have any. So this time I asked \"Do you still make them\", and her response was \"Every once in a while\". WHAT!?  Note to Rainbow: Don't put something on your menu that you don't regularly serve.    I won't be heading back even though the maple bacon donuts are yummy."}
{"text":"I stopped in never having a rainbow doughnut before   While in Glendale for a child's game.  WOW that was the best whipped cream donut . I got the chocolate glazed and plain glazed. It was great. I wished I would have gotten more to take home to the east valley.  I will be sure to stop here again if ever on this side of the valley. Also the girl at the counter today was very friendly made it pleasant."}
{"text":"Great doughnuts especially the nutella filled ones. But when you're ordering for a lot of people and get back only to find that they forgot to place several of them in the box, I had to knock a few stars off."}
{"text":"Mable bacon donuts were soo good! They also have an Oreo donut which is really good!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a sunday morning when I asked for a blueberry muffin the lady laughed at me. made me feel stupid for asking. I guess they only have them when they want. remember both bosa and dunkin is a 1/2 mile down the road.thanks for first and last visit"}
{"text":"Fresh food! Great service and clean shop! Sandwiches are amazing! Oh and doughnuts are always fresh and. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very tasty , not greasy, specialty donut, only seen in New York City. Rare found in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I think it's so cool that they have a door that opens and closes! Cool place. Can't wait to try you guys out again !"}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful little place.  Lovely welcome, great donuts... my only gripe is the takeaway coffee only offered powdered creamer. For a coffee and donut place, you need to offer half and half! That was my only gripe, though."}
{"text":"5 stars for the kolaches and the customer service! Sam the co-owner chatted it up with my boyfriend and I while we ate our kolaches at the counter.  My boyfriend is from Texas and knows his Kolaches. We've noticed the sign on the sidewalk and finally made it in. They claim it is the ONLY place dishing out the Texas Kolaches (I'll stand by that claim --we've been looking for Kolaches for awhile now). They serve up spicy sausage, regular, and spicy ham & jalapeno - all served with cheese, yes please. If you have never had a kolache it is similar to a pig-in-a-blanket amped up on yumminess.  They have an espresso machine and many donuts choices. I will be saving that experience for next time. Oh, and I also read someone's review on breakfast burritos - looking forward to that too.  It's an older place that reflects its age. With a little sprucing up it could the cutest and best donut/kolache shop in town!"}
{"text":"We wandered in while waiting for an oil change down the street. 10am on a drizzly Saturday meant they were cleared out of a lot of donuts, not surprising. We each got a donut and coffee and sat down to eat. Coffee is pretty good here. The teenage girl behind the counter told us she couldn't run the espresso machine, but oh well. My buttermilk donut was pretty yummy. Not sure I would ever come back, but it was good for an impromptu visit."}
{"text":"This is some of the best donuts I have ever had .....and I have tried a hell of a lot of donuts believe me  It is though they knew exactly what I would like . The apple fritter was crispy on the outside, doughy goodness on the inside mmmmm  I didn't even know the shop was there .  Rainbow Donuts was across the street from where I was doing laundry and it was ether Rainbow  or Circle K .......easy choice"}
{"text":"My family has been stopping by this place since the opening last year. We were so excited to see the offering of boba on the menu, so we waited patiently. Thankfully, it did not disappoint! The staff are friendly, and definitely like joke with the regulars that come in. I'm in love with their red velvet doughnuts, the only shop I've seen that carries them.   Everything is made fresh, including the iced coffees. Because of this, do be prepared to wait. It's never an issue for me, but can be a deterrent to some. They are also not packed behind the counter, I've seen maybe three people staffed at once, usually it's one or two. Again, not an issue for me, but something to keep in mind. Oh, about the powdered creamer only for the coffee? They do carry the liquid creamers, but you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Great donuts.  I think they are just a slight step below BoSa, but they are very good."}
{"text":"I stop by here to get my Texas kolaches ever chance I could, they make it so good with either spicy sausage, regular sausage, or ham& cheese. So so sooooooooooooo good (haven't found any other place that have Texas kolaches).  Their ham&cheese croissant are so darn good also. Lastly, can't forget the donuts. They are all so yummy. Great service also, the young ladies working here is so polite and helpful."}
{"text":"NOT KOLACHES!   Granted they make good donuts. Very nice donuts.  The apple and cherry fritters are fantastic.  HOWEVER...If you are looking for an honest to goodness Czech Texas Kolache, keep going.  They offer a sausage kolache and that's it.  Having grown up with kolaches from West, TX (Village Bakery is better than Czech Stop, just sayin'), I've not found the real thing yet.   Four stars for donuts, 0 for kolaches."}
{"text":"All I have to say is BEST DONUTS AND SMOOTHIES EVER! They have awesome customer service and are very quick and helpful as soon as you walk though the door. I have yet to try one of their sandwiches because I just stopped in on a whim. But they definitely have turned me into a fan, I will be back."}
{"text":"Note to self - do not write anything but 5 star reviews to a place that you frequent because your picture is attached to profile...  My original review, 3 stars thinking that the 'A-OK' 3-star designation was an affirmation.  Of course I wander in this morning and I am firmly rebuffed...evidently being called adorable isn't good enough nor are all the other positives I mentioned - it's the 3 stars.  So, ignoring the fact that there aren't any outside tables...ignoring the fact that within an hour of direct sunlight, the place heats up unbearably...Ignoring the fact that I sometimes get pan-handled outside...ignoring the fact that I sometimes have to hunt them down for a refill on my coffee...ignoring the infrequent times I've gone there to find them closed because the baker pulled a no-show the night before (less frequent these days)...  The donuts are always good, the coffee is quite good and the women are indeed adorable...a 5 star update.  Now Linda, please, can I get refills?  ;-)"}
{"text":"We were in town from out of state and decided to stop and buy some donuts. The donuts are quite pricey compared to dunkin donuts and aren't very much better in my opinion. I asked for a iced matcha latte, which had powder lumps all over it and was not very good either, not worth the $5 for a cup. The asian man at the counter wasn't nice either, overall horrible experience and will not come back ever again."}
{"text":"I liked Rainbow Donuts.  They had a fair selection of donuts that appeared to be made on the premises.  The coffee was fine.  Not a lot of seating, but the morning I was there most people got take out; so, we didn't have a hard time snagging one of the three booths (there are two are three small tables as well).  They have free Wi Fi which I really appreciated now that I often read the morning news\"paper\" on a screen.  The service was OK, though I don't think the polite young woman behind the counter had had her coffee yet.  They were out of whipped cream donuts when I got there which was very disappointing, but I enjoyed the ones I had (chocolate chocolate cake, raspberry jelly, half a glazed donut).  I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Phoenix, and I'd get there early to try one of the whipped cream donuts."}
{"text":"Great stuff. Mainly came here for some Bubble Tea. Tried 4 different kinds and all were great. They even have some off the wall flavors like Durian. I wanted to cross that one off the bucket list so I asked them to bring me a piece of the fruit out and they awkwardly agreed. I tried it but not sure I would again. At least not by itself. They said it tastes better mixed into the smoothie."}
{"text":"Cheap! Delicious donuts! It reminds me of the donut shops they have all over Southern California. My girlfriend got one filled with whipped cream (not custard like a Boston creme, but actual whipped creme). Open from 4am til 7pm! Not fancy and definitely a \"sometimes\" food choice, but perfect for what it is."}
{"text":"We stopped by after lunch at Los Reyes de la Torta.  Since it was really close to closing time we didn't really have much of a selection to choose from.  We got a bunch of chocolate bars, glaze, and some others.  $6 for one dozen.  The lady was really nice and patient while we decided on the donuts we wanted in our dozen.  Wish we came a little earlier so we could choose from the larger selection."}
{"text":"So tasty! We went to three Rainbow Donuts locations in one day looking for their famous Maple Bacon donut.  The first two locations didn't have it, but we of course tried some donuts and they are the softest donuts I've ever had, and this was at 11 in the morning, so they'd been sitting a while, and still so soft!  We finally decided on the third place (this location) to see if they had the donut we were looking for.  Her response, \"no, but we can make some for you, when will you be here and how many would you like?\"    What??  That's amazing service.  And the donut lived up to the hype completely!  Definitely will return, soft and delicious donuts!"}
{"text":"The place is a little run down but very clean.  The friendly Asian man and woman (owners?) and were friendly.  They didn't have a very wide variety at 11 on a Sunday, but I bought a ham and cheese croissant, glazed donut holes, and a frozen hot chocolate.  Ham and cheese croissant: It was okay.  The woman behind the counter \"heated it up\" but it was in a microwave, not a high speed oven or toaster that would have made it less squishy and more flakey.  Sliced ham and cheese were grocery store quality.  Donut holes: Tasted a tiny bit stale, but still good.  I prefer BoSa's in Chandler though.  I imagine these are fantastic when warm.  I'm going to save some and try pop them in the microwave later.  Frozen hot chocolate: Very heavy on the cocoa powder, and served without whipped cream.  Could've used some more  sweetness and a creamy vanilla flavor in it.  Added a couple pumps of sugar free peppermint syrup at home to wake it up and balance the bitterness of the cocoa.  I've yet to find a FHC that can beat Dairy Queen's, sadly.  Rainbow has a very convenient location with easy parking, though their hours are somewhat limited.  I'd rather support them than a chain, and they're a step above my other local choice of Bashas', so I would be back if I need (or want) any donuts."}
{"text":"I don't have many donut places in my immediate neighborhood.   I generally drive a few Miles to get to a good one, mostly because I refuse to go to Dunkin' Donuts. I tried rainbow today for the first time. I know it's been in this location for many years, but it always looks closed for some reason. Anyway, the lady at the counter is very very very nice. Which is the biggest reason I give 4 stars. The donuts are average in my opinion. But definitely better than stupid Dunkin' Donuts. The Boston creams I got didn't really have much filling. But remember, I'm basing this against my experience at another donut shop.  These rainbow donuts are just fine to eat and are soft and fresh. I'm just super picky about my donuts.  I feel that donut making is an art form.  So I hold it to a very high standard.  Yes I'm a dork.   See my pics for more info"}
{"text":"I go here almost everyday before school and they have amazing donuts breakfast foods ,the donuts are never hard ,always fresh !!!,but the breakfast foods take a while to be made but well worth  the wait!!"}
{"text":"Service = super friendly Establishment = clean but a bit run down  And last but not least 'donuts' = tasted freshly made...they only had glaze left and they where getting ready to close so that is probably why. I also had a boba Thai tea which was also good. I just don't know that I would drive out of my way for a donut and Thai boba tea that I can get closer to home."}
{"text":"My fiance is from Texas and when he moved here to be with me I was so sad that we wouldn't get to have any Kolache's anymore.   HOWEVER, he is so amazing and found this location. We went less than 24 hours after we heard about it and it was soooooo AMAZING! We will go back and I'm glad I found my Texas favorite in Arizona. :)"}
{"text":"Doughnuts from this joint are awesome. I have tried at least 6 different types. The hot coffee was nasty. It tastes gross!! I will never purchase another coffee but clean doughnut shop. Owner is very friendly Asian man who does not understand English too well. He makes mean doughnuts though that melt in your melt and are made fresh daily early in the morning."}
{"text":"I came in  on an early Friday morning to buy a dozen and a half of donuts for my co- workers. The man behind the counter found it odd I order such an amountapparently, by the way he repeated my order. In my case 1 dozen would have been too little, 2 dozen too many and I didn't want to waste any. That alrady made me feel uncomfortable. Just fulfill whatever order you get, I am customer. It was my first time here, after many, many drive by's. He asked me what flavors and suggested to make a mix, I didn't have a preference, as I just liked an assortment. Again I was frowned upon. Just give me your bestselling flavors...what's the problem. Well, I guess it was once and never again. The donuts were fresh tasting, but the service was far beyond friendly. To bad, you could have earned a new customer."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great donuts, great thai tea with boba, coffee is excellent, and they make awesome breakfast sandwiches. Staff is always cheerful and they give rewards for repeat business. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great donuts! Don't see what you want? No problem, they will make it for you on the spot! You won't get a fresher donut than that!"}
{"text":"This place would be easy to miss as there's not much in this area. I'm over this way once a week for work and had some time to kill. I decided a donut would make a nice late breakfast and thought I'd give this place a try. Glad I did! It's clean inside. Cashier was pleasant. Nice variety! Tried a Cinnamon Creme Filled. Delicious! Fresh! Will be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars all of the way!  The cute girl behind the counter recommended the maple bacon donut.  It was interesting and not bad by any means but it wasn't for me.  The apple fritter on the other hand!!!!!    It was amazing.  I recently moved to Phoenix and have been looking for a good donut shop like I had at home.  I haven't even been able to find a good cake donut in this town.  I have been settling for dunkin donuts, safeway or frys crappy selection.  I brought donuts in for the office and they were talked about all day.  I have a feeling I will be stopping by very soon to pick up more office goodies."}
{"text":"Good little donut shop with a large selection and good pricing. I have only been here on weekday mornings, so as the day goes on, I'm sure the selection dwindles. My favorite is the apple fritter. Like another yelper said, it's crispy on outside and soft on the inside with a ton of apples.  I've also gotten the iced coffee (because I didn't want to make another stop). It was good, but for the price, I probably wouldn't get it regularly.  Regular donuts $1.00 Fancy donuts $1.95 (I think....) Iced coffee $2.35 (or close to that....comes in large only)  Don't quote me on the pricing, I'm going by memory and believe it or not, that's not always accurate.  Easy to access of 7th st, plenty of parking, friendly service."}
{"text":"I come in here for a breakfast sandwich before work, and it's just what I need to get the day started.  Donuts are fresh. The customer service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Two words: Texas Kalaches. Haha! We also tried the Maple Bacon Donut and it was surprisingly good (I couldn't eat a whole one, but its good!). I wish it wasn't so far away, though!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the maple bacon donut.  It was pretty good.  It tasted like maple frosting and bacon fat.  Mine didn't look like the one on the pictures.  The bacon was not chopped up as small and was more like large pieces cut into squares.  I haven't had anything else here and I'm not sure I would as I'm just not a big sweet fan but after all the talk about the maple bacon one I am glad I got to scratch it off my list."}
{"text":"When you open the door you are walking into a portal to a magical place. I recommend the cream filled, they slice them in half and smear a thick layer of cream in between, real cream; not that Boston cream (custard) crap. The maple bacon donuts is amazeballs. Everything I've tried is heavenly and cheap. And oh - the croissant sandwiches are delicious and half the size of your head. Support local :)"}
{"text":"Oh, how I LOVE the donuts here!  Seriously, the most amazingly fresh donuts you will ever eat.  I have probably had every single variety offered, and still haven't found one that doesn't meet my donut-snob standard.  My favorites are the pink-frosted sprinkle cake donut, cinnamon crumb in cake and raised form, and the maple bars.  We have called ahead for large orders, which were always perfectly executed.  I only wish that this spot was on my way to work... although I'm gaining weight just thinking about it.    I'm ONLY taking off a star because their bathroom is seriously disgusting.  Really.  Don't go in there. EVER.   But, ignoring that downside... this is the BEST donut shop in all of AZ!"}
{"text":"These donuts are the best in 3 states and actually sweet without the extra extra sugar... not to mention it's cheaper and faster than DDs."}
{"text":"The shop is not impressive nor are the donuts. I can still feel the grease on the roof of my mouth. After being there 20 years, you'd think they'd have a public restroom!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bacon doughnuts, need i say more! At $2 it is well worth it! It's like breakfast in a handy snack. Also regular fresh made doughnuts are only $1! I did my paper here no wifi but there were tables and an outlet. Lots of parking and a bathroom. Closes at 3 or 4pm"}
{"text":"They just recently opened up this location here off of Olive Street in Glendale it is run by a very nice lady and they have all the assortment of donuts you can imagine."}
{"text":"If I were to ever get hooked on crack... I would want my crack to be these amazing donuts! They are delicious and addicting."}
{"text":"I stop here and grab donuts for friends and family/co-workers. Not to mention my son who memorized where this is and always makes me stop by for a glazed donut. No coma plants yet about this location or the quality. Donuts are amazing and staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I didn't get in early enough to get a better selection, but they made up the delicious maple bacon ones for me that had been recommended to me. Yum! And they open at 4. By the way. That is 4 AM"}
{"text":"Kalika and Peter are the sweetest and truly made sure I got the perfect donuts for my wedding day. They were attentive, on time and the donut bar looked fantastic. Everyone raved about the Oreo and pink sprinkle donuts. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"On the quest for a delicious donut, I stopped by here in the afternoon. I purchased a chocolate, chocolate glazed cake donut. After my sticker shock ($1.25 for one donut!) I sunk my teeth into this thick, fresh donut. Oh My Gosh!  absolutely melted in my mouth!  This proved to be well worth the money. The donut was about 2\" think, moist and tasty. The donuts in the grocery stores are awful, and on other place has good donuts, but I think Rainbow tops the list!  Try it!, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"The woman that works there every day likes to complain if you pay with a $20.00 bill. I asked why is that a problem and she said \"Its a big bill!\". You would think that she would be more professional and better prepared to make change since she owns a retail store.   Needless to say, I don't go there anymore. I used to go almost daily for about a year but she doesn't appreciate a steady customer and would rather complain about how you pay. You can't simply make change for a $20.00 bill? And you would rather berate a steady customer Seriously?!"}
{"text":"This place has the best donuts ! Way better than Dunkin' Donuts. And there food is amazing ! And there prices are worth it . I go there almost every weekend"}
{"text":"The ham and cheese on a croissant is like oscar meyer lunchmeat and nothing special.  The donuts are nothing to brag about.  Far from impressed after reading these raving comments!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, and always a hit when I bring them in to work.  The cream filled donuts are wonderful."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Arizona, I'd like to stop by this donut shop. (Yes it is that good if I am coming all the way from California!).  The donuts are very good and fresh. I hear they make it every morning (finish before 3-4 am I think!) so they never sell over one-day old donuts. You can definitely taste the freshness : ).   Customer service is very good, they always say hi and thank you which is very obsolete in many other donut shops we visited! We just had our wedding, if they were in LA we'd definitely have them cater a sweets bar."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found this donut shop!! The donuts every morning and even in the evening when I go at 7 p.m. before closing are fresh delicious and I have not found anywhere that has better customer service! The owner and the employee's are amazingly nice and they know what you like and have your usual down pat!"}
{"text":"Bacon maple donut is unreal, seriously off the radar. Was in love at first bite then had another. Place is clean and staff super friendly."}
{"text":"Great donuts, pass on the kolache though. Very fresh and lots of filling in the filling donuts! A fave in the area."}
{"text":"Rainbow donuts is the best! They have honest to God Texas Kolaches. We're talking REAL KOLACHES people. The owners are so sweet and welcoming. Amazing. Super inexpensive. Delicious, simple coffee. Come early because this place is amazing and sells out SUPER fast. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This place has such amazing customer service! The lady with the red hair at the counter went above and beyond to help us. She was one of the kindest people I've met the whole time I've lived in AZ and made the whole experience so pleasant. I can't wait to come again. She's great and the food is too!"}
{"text":"The lady that is always up front always has a smile on her face and greats you in a very warm manner. I love donuts and am picky about them. This place is by far has the very best donuts in town.  They are always fresh and the employees are always very friendly."}
{"text":"I go here almost every morning before work, donuts are ALWAYS amazing. The youngish woman is usually who's there when I go and she's always super friendly and works in a timely fashion. Also knows the prices off the top of her head. I guess if I were to give a \"complaint\" it would be that it's a little out dated inside, could use a little more work. BUT still 5/5 would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"If I were to stop and get a donut here..I am not saying I have, just if I did ..I have to say they remind me of the ones I love from So Cal.  They would I am guessing, have that light greasiness combined with sweetness. Probably they are lightly iced .I bet if I went there I would really like an old fashioned one. Just if I went there."}
{"text":"There are seriously some mornings in my house where my family will look at eachother ...say, \"Donuts?\" and we all magically know that this donut craving can't be satiated by simply Dunkin. Though these mornings are few and far between because my family has more of a convenience over quality attitude, they do occur.   My mother discovered Rainbow donuts because she works in Phoenix and before Dunkin had its viral takeover of Arizona, it was the only place to get donuts on the way to the office.  As far as donuts go I honestly don't think there's a way that Rainbows donuts could be any better. Maybe if they were covered in diamonds and had reverse calories. Everything they have tastes fresh even if it's bought at closing time. The prices are so cheap that I wonder how they even stay in business. The employees are always super friendly.   Convert your donut religion to Rainbow donuts today. See the light. Repent!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter which doughnut(s) you choose, they are all incredible. There is no comparison. Rainbow doughnuts are addicting."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place .. Iced coffee is great for the price and the boba is awesome ! Donuts are always fresh and the customer service is excellent ! Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"THEY HAVE KOLACHES!!! Delicious, perfect savory kolaches, along with the nicest staff ever! I review on Yelp quite a bit and I am just in love with this little shop. I drive here from Goodyear every weekend. So worth it."}
{"text":"I came here in the afternoon to pick up some treats for my little nieces. By the time we were able to dig into the donuts, it was 3pm and the they were still seemingly fresh! The selection in the afternoon wasn't too expansive, but good enough.  I decided to get a Thai Tea with boba and it was good as well. It's tricky to get perfect boba at a place that doesn't specialize in it, but I would say this boba texture was decent.   Their reputation is well earned!"}
{"text":"Greatest doughnuts I have ever had and the boba is out of this world. Great sandwiches for cheap also. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Had to introduce our OH-IO group out for our wedding to the Maple Bacon Donuts...AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I saw rave reviews on Rainbow donuts and it wasn't until I saw the maple bacon donut that I needed to go and give them a visit, besides the location is just about a mile from my house.  So my boyfriend and I shown up around 10am, I didn't expect a large selection of doughnuts to still be available at that time but they were! They didn't have the maple bacon doughnut out but the lady gladly offered to make us some. I ordered the maple bacon, and my boyfriend ordered the Oreo doughnut. We waited about 5 minutes and we were served. I was concerned that the doughnut didn't have much maple on it but boy was I wrong, the amount of maple and bacon was perfect! My boyfriend doughnut was also good, considering I'm not a big cookie person.   As I mentioned we shown up around 10 am. The only thing I would've wanted differently was a warm doughnut, but they open at 4am so next time I plan on showing up when they're fresh from the oven. We also ordered iced coffee. Again not to sweet, not lacking just a nice cool treat. I'm a sugar freak, so I went in wanting and expecting to have a sugar high, but to be doughnuts they weren't so sweet that you have to drink a tub of water afterwards, and I liked that.  With the friendly customer service and the products offered I give them 5 stars! We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Definitely beats dunkin and it has almost a cult like following with one of my dental professors. \"Students, today we are graced with a special treat. Do not be ashamed to eat these donuts. They stand above the rest.\" Good? Yes. Enough to make an impact. Not dying to go back right now but then again I just finished eating the following (I probably should not think about eating for a while)  -Glazed french cruller:  best of that variety I have ever had. It completely melted in my mouth.  -Glazed donut hole: unremarkable -Sprinkled vanilla cake:  not a fan but I am a yeast girl at heart -Cherry frosted cake: quite good but never would have guessed was cherry flavored had I not checked the website -Buttermilk: rich, decadent, dreamy. I had never tried buttermilk before, but if you are looking for a donut that makes an impact, this is it.    The buttermilk and french cruller would be my go to donuts next round but I want to try more....the apple fritter, raspberry jelly filled...so many donuts, too little time"}
{"text":"Fresh donuts , delicious!! I love the boba drinks also , I always get the Strawberry Banana with strawberry flavored boba and my friend gets the mango smoothie. The croissants are really good too!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. Breakfast sandwiches, coffee, and the donut are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"The donuts are amazing. My wife and I got a Glazed, Boston Cream, Coconut and a Chocolate covered Cake donut. All the donuts were moist and wonderfully made. The bagels, however, were not. They had the texture of a dense bread, not the chew of a proper bagel. Also, they smothered it in an inordinate amount of cream cheese.   But man, those donuts. So good."}
{"text":"Sorry kids... I don't get how this place has 4 1/2 stars. It's like a dunkin' donuts yet slightly more substantial. The espresso was meh, apple fritter underdone (read: raw/uncooked at the center) and I had one of them there Texas thingies that folks were raving about and I was under-whelmed. Typical fast food donut decor.   The good news was the service was friendly and efficient.  Best donut joints in my book? Whoo's donuts in Santa Fe, NM; Bob's donuts at the old Farmer's Market (by Fairfax), LA, CA; and the Donut Man in Glendora, CA."}
{"text":"I live nowhere near here (thank God!) but have had their donuts from co-workers bringing them in and have been in store. I recently tried the Texas kolache, which is a breaded sausage and cheese pastry. You can get it spicy or not, I chose for the not spicy warmed up. It was delicious! As far as donuts, their glazed is addicting. I also got an iced chai, which was very flavorful and delicious. Restaurant inside has bar seating and a few tables. Staff is also really friendly. Overall winner here!!"}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice in the past week and both times I have been disappointed. The first time I ordered a half-dozen donuts and the donuts I ate tasted old. I bought them at 6:30AM, so they should taste fairly fresh but they tasted like they were re-used donuts from yesterday's batches. On my second visit, it was the same story. I tried an old cinnamon roll and an old Bavarian cream with chocolate icing. Oh and one more thing, don't bother going here if you just want a donut and only have a card. They have a $5 minimum purchase requirement here in order to use a card. I won't be coming back here again. My advice.....just plan ahead and go to Lamars on Bell Rd"}
{"text":"Donuts were excellent and i will visit again for those...however the coffee i ordered was awful. Tasted burnt. If you are a donut shop.. you prob should get coffee right..just sayin"}
{"text":"Ok, so this spot has ALWAYS been a donut shop and it's always been great! The iced coffee was delicious, as was the bagel breakfast sandwich. Try the cronut! I don't know from what magical fantasyland a croissant and a donut merged, but mama likey!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots to get doughnuts in the valley! Always fresh and always tasty. I'm a fan of the cereal-coated doughnuts, but boyfriend loves the maple-bacon doughnut."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite go to places in the mornings! Their donuts are exceptionally fresh and delicious. Their ham and cheese filled croissants are to die for;  their sausage and cheese kolaches are the bomb; and I can never get tired of their Thai iced tea's with Boba! After eating their donuts I can no longer even fathom eating donuts at one of the large chain donut stores again. You would think that their prices would be more expensive, however it is just the opposite. Their lower prices combined with the guest appreciation punchcard allows me to bring my staff donuts even more frequently than before which makes them happy!"}
{"text":"Update! I stopped in this morning for a dozen donuts. Everyone at work loved them and had nothing but nice things to say about Rainbow! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee!! I got an iced latte and was super tasty!  Kalika and Peter were so friendly.  Great customer service. I'm not from AZ, just stopped in after finding them on Yelp.  I will def be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Way better than any Krispy Kreme or Dunkin.  Great donuts, only real complaint is the service could have been faster.  Other than that, great."}
{"text":"The glazed donuts are so amazing. Fresh, light and airy. So good. Apple fritters are yummy too. :)"}
{"text":"Exspectionally delicious donuts would 10/10 recommend going! All the donuts are delicious so you can't go wrong! Unless your some crazy dude that buys jelly!"}
{"text":"It is dangerous to live this close to a Rainbow donuts. I have been here more times in the last two weeks than I am proud to admit, but I have tried a variety of items:  - bacon maple donut: delicious, amazing, definitely recommend - apple fritter: incredible, fluffy in the middle, crispy on huge outside, chunks of fresh apple, yum!  - ham, cheese and jalapeño croissant: sinfully delicious, not too greasy, not overfilled, just right - spicy sausage and cheese kolache: so tasty! Sausage with great flavor, puffy pastry, gooey cheese - delicious  I would (obviously) recommend any of the items above. Can't wait to try the cherry fritter. :-)  The staff at this location are super friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed the donuts and drink I got here. The apple fritter was perfect, sweet with a slight crunch and not at all heavy with oil like most places I've tried. The old fashion donut was different that what I'm used to, didn't taste the same, but it was good none the less. This will definitely be my local donut stop."}
{"text":"All I can say is that this donut shop blows any others way out of the park!! Don't waste your time at Dunkin Donuts, seriously these donuts are THE BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! My favorite is the croissant breakfast sandwiches. They have great sandwiches period, but I'm a big breakfast person. The donuts are also good. I love the donut holes and you can never go wrong with glazed, raspberry filled or a cinnamon roll. The donuts are fresh and don't look like they've been sitting all day and they even sell gallons of milk just in case you're buying for a large group and don't have time to make an extra stop. This is truly one of the best spots! Worth a try!!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't like the fact that the donuts are not in a closed case. As soon as you walk in the donuts are just out on a shelf behind them and yes I know Dunkin' Donuts does the same thing but ewwww.   Why do I want my donuts breathing the same air as everybody else? At least make an effort to make it look like they're separated and fresh, it just makes me uneasy. Also this location does not have sandwiches like the other locations and the customer service was just okay..."}
{"text":"These donuts are the best ever!   I don't care if they shorten my life 5 minutes...it's worth it!  You can taste every light and creamy, fluffy layer when you bite down into a chocolate long john...with just the right amount of delightful chocolate on top!   Try a buttermilk bar...crispy on the outside lite and tasty in the middle...there are no better in this town!  O boy do I want one right now!"}
{"text":"The best.  Period. (Since I am being forced to write more -- I repeat.... the best.  Period.) Obviously, I love this place. WHY does it keep saying \"Finish My Review\"????? That's all folks!"}
{"text":"Good selection, decent prices, pretty good donuts. Worst iced coffee I've ever tried in my life, though!!"}
{"text":"Almost went to a chain nearby and decided to try something new. I'm really glad that I did.  The service was excellent and friendly and the doughnuts were unique without being obnoxious. Little touches like bits of cereal sprinkled onto the pastry instead of just sprinkles really sets the flavor apart.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee. It's every bit as good as what you'd get at a similar shop, but the price is outstanding.  This is definitely a new go-to. Great diner vibe, awesome prices and a welcoming atmosphere. Oh, and the doughnuts are outstanding as well."}
{"text":"If you do not love Rainbow Donuts you do-nut know what you are talking about.....yeah you can boo me.  I know that fancy donuts are the new craze, but I love that this place makes classic, delicious, donuts with some fancy flavors thrown here and there. I believe this is why the place thrives and can keep their costs low. HOWEVER the maple bacon donut cannot be tamed. This is a must order.   I have probably eaten every donut here, and I will say, you can't go wrong. I do suggest going earlier because you will definitely want a fresh donut.   Not sure how else I can rave about Rainbow Donuts, so just go. OK? thanks."}
{"text":"Always super friendly. I am not a morning person and they definitely make my mornings easier. Good customer service and have delicious smoothies as well. Try their boba drinks."}
{"text":"Love these donuts! I can never buy just one donut because they all look Sooooo good! Needs a shop in the East valley."}
{"text":"Drove out here for the kolaches. I'm from Texas and these things are spot on. Will definite make the 35 mike drive again for their kolaches."}
{"text":"The lady was very quiet and unfriendly. Donuts were okay, nothing groundbreaking. I ordered two donuts and a peach boba smoothie. The boba looked weird and old. The smoothie was okay overall. The one thing that REALLY bothered me was that there was at least 5 BEES INSIDE THE RESTAURANT. I didn't realize it at first but the second I saw the bees I got out of there as fast as I could. Sucks, because this place is right by my house. Sadly, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's a decently run spot. Tho, I do believe the vast majority of the establishment is looking a bit...outdated. They have a solid array of donuts ranging from bacon maple to maple bars. An ample amount of glazed donuts were offered first after asking the gentlemen manning the cash register. I tried the 2  different cake donuts and a maple bar after gazing over the donut eye candy. It wasn't very good. Very dry and the amount of sugar used was to a level I could feel it attacking my teeth   The place is a reminder of the past with much of its nostalgia beginning to look run-down, reaching the end of its natural life cycle. If they did a tech-refresh of the place, I do belive they could attract more foot traffic."}
{"text":"Better than Krispy Kremes sugar-and-air donuts, Dunkin's more cakey donuts, overly greasy grocery store donuts, and Bosa's lower quality. Haven't tried their coffee or other options, so I can't speak to those.  But like some people mentioned, the availability isn't always the best. Those maple-bacon ones are always gone before I can get to them!"}
{"text":"The maple bacon doughnut was tasty, but the cherry fritter blew. my. mind. My iced coffee was decent as well. I anticipate returning to rainbow doughnuts!"}
{"text":"On a whim while missing home, I did a Yelp search for Texas Kolaches and Rainbow Donuts is what I got.  It's not close to my house, being in Phoenix, but luckily, it is close to my new job.  I don't make it up here nearly often enough, but when I do, it's always worth it!   Not only are they the only place in Phoenix with Texas Kolaches (that sign isn't lying...I can't find them anywhere else), they also have a huge selection of donuts!   My personal favorites are the spicy sausage kolache and chocolate frosted buttermilk donuts.  I've tried the bacon maple donut, and it was good, but it really needed more bacon (is there such a thing as ever enough bacon?).  Other winners are of course, the sprinkle donut, the cake donuts, and some kind of chocolate cake donut with a honey glaze.  Really, I don't think I've ever had a bad donut here.   The woman behind the counter is always friendly and patient with me as I take forever deciding what I want (I always go in for 1 or 2 and come out with 6 or 7).   There are a few Rainbow Donuts sprinkled around town, but they're all independently owned.  I've never tried the others, so just to be safe, you better just come to this one.  :)"}
{"text":"What a great little neighborhood donut shop!  Free Wi-Fi, great cappuccinos, and DONUTS! What else do you need?!  Oh, and they are actually doing Yelp deals! I did my first Yelp deal here, getting a discount on my order for checking in on Yelp!  It's like free donuts! Woot!!"}
{"text":"I go here every weekend just for the amazing service and AMAZING donuts. I've honestly never had better donuts & the fact that they have boba makes everything so much better with the nice staff! I'd recommend coming here anytime!"}
{"text":"Hot breakfast sandwiches, fresh donuts, bobas, ice cream and drinks. This is a must stop for breakfast when I'm in town. Quick and cheap! It doesn't get better than Rainbow Donuts.   Clean interior and friendly faces will welcome you to stay, or you are sure to have your order out the door in minutes if in a hurry.   They are on the south west corner of Olive and 47th Ave. in a small plaza that shares a parking lot with a few other businesses. Popular place. Get there early for best choice of donuts but I've never seen them run out.   Must try."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews. But I hope the businesses read them and make changes. I brought my daughter here to pick up some donuts and when it was time to pay I noticed the lady helping me still had her glove on. The receipt I had to sign  was a little curly so she flattened it with her still gloved hand and handed me a pen with her gloved hand. It was strange because her other hand was not gloved and she never used it. Are the gloves used to protect her from me? Anyway as I was leaving I was praying she would take the glove off but instead she used that same glove to randomly touch and arrange the donuts on display. *sad face*"}
{"text":"Three words: maple bacon donut. Go here, you won't regret it. It looks like a cute little diner on the inside, with little barstools & the like."}
{"text":"The BEST fritters anywhere. Seriously! Apple is my favorite. I used to live in the neighborhood, then a crack-head jumped my wall and tried to steal my bike. I was so over living cheap and we moved.   But as I sit here in Surprise in suburbia safeness and chain hell, craving a donut this morning, this location of Rainbow donuts is where I wish I could be.   I also miss the sandwiches/Gyros from the Shell Station at Central and Dunlap-best Gyros too. But, I digress...   Tried all the various donuts and loved them,but the fritters haunt me- cheap price was a bonus. For $5 we had Saturday morning covered for breakfast. Sigh, missing the donuts..."}
{"text":"Items selected included: Blueberry Cake Buttermilk Cake Strawberry Raised Apple Fritter Chocolate Oreo Maple Bacon  For their last day in Phoenix I took my mother and aunt to La Grande Orange - easily my favorite spot in The Valley - but being late risers I decided to grab some donuts beforehand just down the street at Rainbow Donuts, an independent branch of the local chain that many claim to make the best donuts in the area.  Opening early - I believe 4am - and at least by 5:15am when I arrived on 12/31 the shop is small and anything but trendy, the only other patrons during my visit a trio of old veterans who apparently meet there daily, but with a friendly staff and an interesting selection of classics and novel options alike I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Selecting a half dozen donuts and taking portions of each home it likely comes as no surprise that the warm cake donuts were my favorite - the buttermilk bar literally still dripping glaze - and with the blueberry subtle and light plus the fritter less greasy than the average with a great crunch giving way to cinnamon apples within I enjoyed all three more than those that were raised - the dough a bit less wispy or raised than I prefer and the frosting on both the maple and the strawberry a bit too artificial, though the Oreo option was admittedly quite good as the frosting approximated the flavor of Nestle Quick."}
{"text":"One of the user photos shows trays filled with donuts.  It must have been staged by the owners.  When I was there, there were a few each of several varieties with a lot of the trays empty.  The donut I ordered was okay but very generic and not too fresh.  The coffee was the same.  For such a large place I was surprised that there weren't any real pastries, only fried donuts.  The place is old and seems to have a ready flow of customers who know exactly what they want when they come in.  It was staffed by two attractive young people, she took our order and seemed a little cold and he never looked at us although we were the only ones there.  Oddly, when we got up to leave both became very friendly and wished us a good day with big smiles.  Maybe they are happier when people leave than when people come?  Remember, Yelp's guidelines for the rating system is that 3-stars means A-OK, which is not a bad rating, only that there was nothing hugely bad or great about Rainbow Donuts Café."}
{"text":"I have driven by no fewer than a hundred times, but this place just never caught my eye. Today I decided to drop in and I'm so glad I did. Besides the donuts and boba (which were both very delicious), the lady was so genuinely friendly. Just all around a very positive experience!"}
{"text":"We have purchased donuts to go here many times (try the cinnamon doughnut). However, we stopped here for some breakfast after church. My wife and I had a breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, and cheese. Truly delicious. And a cinnamon roll. So much better than Fry's across the street!  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that they charge for coffee refills."}
{"text":"Donuts are stale, not enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and somewhere else to get your donuts. Definitely not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"I'm out of the closet!  Yay!  No more hiding who I really am!  I'm a proud member of the Rainbow Donuts coalition.  It's not a choice...not just a lifestyle selection (although the donut selection is, in fact, quite robust)...no, it's how I am constructed!  OK, actually I'm bi...I enjoy the occasional \"breakfast burrito\", but if I'm pressed to choose...I'll take the hole and the \"Old Fashioned Glazed\" that surrounds said hole.  That and a good cuppa.  And that's one of the things that separates Rainbow from the rest...the coffee...outstanding Italian roast, well made and very inexpensive...with enough refills to take a bath in.  And I would bathe in the coffee (and possibly the donut glaze) except for the inevitable \"dust-up\" that always occurs when I let my impulses run wild and free!  Don't get me wrong...the donuts are terrific and the nice young lady behind the counter was almost as sweet as the apple fritters.  I had a client meeting there this morning (I know, I spare no expense!), and my clients were just as charmed as I was with Rainbow...the great coffee, the terrific donuts and fritters and the pleasant service (not to mention free wi-fi for my meeting) all combine to make Rainbow Donuts a significant step above the rest.  Most of all, it's the place where I can feel free to be my real, authentic self...out, loud and proud!  And growing a little with each fritter."}
{"text":"Had the spicy kolaches not spicy but a boatload of flavor, they have a special 4 for $10. I would have loaded up on them but I got the last 2. Great buttermilk bar, caramel bar, Boston cream, lemon filled, chocolate coconut. Come here and leave happy."}
{"text":"Rude Chinese lady, high prices, and the cool tastes like shit. They don't even have cream for the coffee. Try bosa donuts instead on 43rd and olive they are the best donuts in az and super cheap. Your welcome"}
{"text":"Mmmmm... glazed donut.... I feel like Homer Simpson with how much I love the glazed donuts here.  Being from Texas, I am sorely missing glazed donuts from Shipley's.  Anyone from the south knows that those are the BEST DONUTS EVER!  But since Shipley's isn't in AZ, this place is a good second.  The donuts are soft, the inside is moist and doughy, yet light at the same time.  The glaze on the outside is sweet, but not sickeningly so like at Krispy Kreme.  and WAIT... I just saw that another review said they have Texas kolaches??  I need to get back there stat!"}
{"text":"I was the office hero when I used to bring these in.  Their chocolate dipped cake donuts are \"The freaking bomb-digadus\", as one friend explained.  And their little donut holes... oh.... heaven.  I often would get there when they were still warm and it was like getting warm fries - you just had to eat some on the car.    They also will also have donuts you may not see other places, which is a nice.  Allows you to go to the same place for monthly donut runs without picking up the same box of donuts each time.    And did I mention how cheap they are?  SO cheap.  Well, cheap to your wallet, but definately not your waistline."}
{"text":"Great donut shop to stop in and pickup some donuts for the office.  The staff is always very nice and quickly puts together random dozens of donuts upon request."}
{"text":"This is a great local donut shop. They always have maple, chocolate sprinkle, and a couple specialties, like Fruity Pebble and coconut flake. They also have cronuts, ice cream, kolaches, coffee, smoothies, and boba. It's always clean and cool inside, with four tables and a couple counters. It's a nice, cozy little place, and there are almost always regulars hanging out in the back corner. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This review is about the lady working the counter. It was an older asian lady. The donuts were fine. When I arrived I told the lady I needed a minute to decide what I wanted. She had already put one glove on. She started fronting the donuts then immediately went from touching the donuts to touching a rag nearby. She cleaned around the donut shelf using the gloved hand. I was really hoping she would change her glove when I was ready to order ,  but she didn't .  She then touched my donuts with the gloved hand and i literally cringed inside . She then proceeded to ring me up at the register using the gloved hand. Immediately after she went back to the donuts ,  fronting them all. I had to say something .  I suggested she change her glove ,  and she literally asked me why !! She must not have her food handlers card or care about hygiene at all."}
{"text":"This place was good for a spontaneous donut craving one Sunday morning...I happened by here when another place was closed on Sunday. It wasn't busy and also didn't have as many donut options as I expected. On this particular day, it didn't look anything like some photos I've seen.   I wanted something creme-filled, but alas -- no luck. I did get a dozen donut holes to go, and yes they were tasty but I was left a little disappointed because I didn't get what I had a taste for.  They have plenty of parking and a counter inside with TV. No complaints about the service.  It may be that they were in the middle of making more donuts or getting some more in. I'll stop by again to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. Every morning before school or if I was late I'd come here and devour the donuts. I still go to this day. Adorable old people seem to eat there together."}
{"text":"So I must confess I usually go to the competition several blocks down the street..not anymore. Rainbow is the shiz!  A coworker was craving donuts and pulled in for a quick dozen. I have been on a mission to find the perfect jelly donut. My search is over.  This perfectly glazed, soft and filled to the brim with sweet, tart raspberry jelly donut was pure donut heaven.  My coworkers chocolate glazed was so fresh when she took a bite it became flat leaving a chocolate schmear on the corners of her mouth.   Service was pleasant and quick. Rainbow is the best!"}
{"text":"So I follow 7th St. Rainbow Donuts on instagram and have been wanting to try them for quite some time but never seemed to be in the area at the right time. Fast forward to Spring Break. Arrived at about 11 not realizing they close at noon. Uh oh was my first thought. I am going to get what no one else wants. We went in anyway. Selection was sparse but we opted to have a go at it. I really wanted to try the maple bacon. The nice lady said well, I can make you a couple! Two maple bacon, one Froot Loop, two chocolate bars, one glazed. I was a little sticker shocked at the $9 price tag but since they were closing soon she threw in some glazed donut holes.  As we were leaving again I was thinking, she threw those donut holes in because they are old and they can't sell them. Boy, oh boy was I wrong. All of the donuts were soft and fresh, yes even the holes.  These donuts were probably some of the best I have ever had. The frosting/glazes were sweet but not overpowering. The dough soft and light. Yum!  I am definitely going to make special trips down 7th street, even go out of my way for these donuts. Can't wait to go back and try a coffee or a boba."}
