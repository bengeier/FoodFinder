{"text":"There aren't that many good reasonably priced sushi restaurants in Etobicoke, so Gojima stands out.

The food is at a reasonable price point for the quality and the lack of competition in the area (~$16-20 for a dinner set, $10-12 for the premium rolls, $4-8 for the 'regular' ones). Miso soup was a bit bland, but our rolls were all fresh, tasty and beautifully presented. Complimentary yam tempura didn't hurt either! 

Clearly a lot of care and thought goes into this restaurant, from the decor to the food. The owners are very friendly and clearly have a rapport with their regulars--a lot of couples were sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the chefs during their meal."}
{"text":"Just went back again, and it was wonderful. You really get some quality rolls and the little starter salads are nice a crisp. I love the dragon rolls especially, but their spider rolls are also quite good.

We got in just before the dinner rush and our server switched on this little neon palm tree and we thought it was pretty funny it was as if to say, 'let me set the mood with the nifty blue tree' - lighting aside it nice and cosy restaurant. Service is always great. They're just not bothered by looking cool or appearing a certain way, the food speaks for itself.

So go, enjoy the free tempura yams and all the amazing rolls and plus the tasty little orange slices, for they give you for dessert."}
{"text":"Food is okay but nothing special. I work across the street and come for take out. The service is horrible the place is dirty. If I call for take out at 11am they will get mad because they don't open for another 30mins.  There's another sushi place two doors down .. will start sending my business over there."}
{"text":"I've been going to Gojima quite a bit over the years, unfortunately today is the last. Even though the atmosphere of the restaurant was weird (I'll get into that later), their sushi used to be amazing, so I would brush it off because of that. Not too long ago they've changed their sushi chef, and that made a huge difference because the quality has totally gone down. I went a couple of times since the change hoping it might improve again, but nope. The slice of fish on the nigiri are so thin and roughly cut, maki rolls are cut very sloppy, and they seem to be adding more rice to them as well. And today I had a big ball of miso paste that hadn't been mixed thoroughly into my soup. The food is just not very appealing or as delicious as it used to be. Now getting back to their whole atmosphere and why I find it so weird. Most times it's dead quiet in there, maybe some music playing in the background, but mostly the staff talking amongst themselves in Korean. I don't really mind, but my bf is Korean and he can understand everything they're talking about (like how they couldn't get fresh but frozen fish today). It's really dark and dingy in there as well. Anyways, this is what I've noticed many times being there; the fact is if you're Caucasian you're going to be treated MUCH better than if you're Asian. The owner becomes a lot more chatty and friendly when Caucasians come into the restaurant. I have never been greeted like that, or felt as welcomed, and yes I'm Asian. With all that being said, it might be dramatic, but I left feeling depressed. Not an experience I'd like to go back to anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered a party platter of the dragon rolls - horrendous.  I've never been inclined to leave a review on yelp until today. Was not happy for the $65 spent,  only half edible. Skip this place for any other...."}
{"text":"Very mixed reviews on here about this place. I was brought by a friend and really enjoyed it. We had the tempura to share and it was delicious. A couple of very big prawns and then some fried veggies. I love love love tempura and was not disappointed. I had the spider roll. It was very tasty. A little less meat than other places but plenty of fresh vegetables in the roll. My friend had a salmon Maki roll and was very happy. 

We got a complimentary pitcher of cold green tea and a complimentary salad with some sort of fishy dressing. It was salty and moreish. The server then brought us a complimentary salmon roll. 8 pieces of spicy fresh salmon with a crunchy shredded topping. They were so nice! All for 43 dollars including tip. We rolled out the door we were so stuffed. When we paid the bill we each got a free sweetie. You couldn't make it up! Unreal. 

We sent at 5 pm and it was very quiet but my friend is a frequent flyer and said it's very very busy at lunch time. The lunch deals looked like great value. I couldn't say a bad word about this meal. Staff did not harass or annoy use and we're quietly attentive. Recommend this place. Highly."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time I go I keep thinking... Metal note.. don't come back. It's not a bad restaurant but it's pricey for what you get. The food is just ok. The decor and ambience is just ok. The service is just ok. So you would think the prices would be average but it's a bit high for what you get. That being said if you're in the mood for sushi and you're in the area, this is probably the best restaurant around this strip of Bloor."}
{"text":"When I stay with my buddies in Toronto, Gojima is key. 

Here's how it goes down:
We get takeout. Spend way too much on as many rolls as possible. Then take it back to their place, make some whiskey and cokes, and just play Halo 3 until all of us are furious and have tension headaches."}
{"text":"The same family has had it for years !
The sushi & sashimi is always fresh 
The atmosphere is comfortable & relaxed 
It has always been a friendly place & lots of fun 
A must for sushi lovers"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for take away sushi. The food is delicious and fresh. Have also ordered for a large group (x30 ppl) and it was just as tasty. I recommend it if you're in the hood."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed with anything you order here! The freshest fish I've ever had! Great and friendly service too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As i have read , some of the reviews ,i totally do not think many of you have eaten there. .As for Rose H review stating it is dirty well i go in thru the kitchen and have seen nothing but a clean place and perhaps the green sign that states it has passed city of toronto health inspection can answer the clean issue . 
The sushi chef has been at this place for over 16 years so in response to new chef , you idiot its way off base family owned business. 
As for the food , sushi is excellent and done very well  with no bullshit mayonnaise to hide bad quality , smell is non existent which will mean freshness. Seaweed salad is great , i do not waste time on meat dishes or miso soup i go for sushi and only sushi . Stay to sushi and you will be fine ."}
{"text":"Very good and cheap food. Simple, cozy and with a great service."}
{"text":"I love the food here, specially the Poke Bowl. Surely I will come back here at lunchtime, and taste other yummy food on the menu. The miso is one of the best miso soup I ever tasted."}
{"text":"This is a great little go-to. I've never been disappointed. Service and atmosphere is laid back, wacky decor, but quality of sushi very good. It seems popular for takeout- people always coming and going throughout dinner."}
{"text":"Everything was okay up until I found a piece of rubber band nestled underneath the salmon teriyaki. When I pointed it out to the owner, he apologized profusely and offered me two tangerines and had me pay $10 instead of $13. I would have given Gojima a one star if it weren't for the good service."}
{"text":"We were here for my coworker's birthday. 

Their lunch specials are reasonably priced and come in a larger than usual bento tray. 

The miso soup was okay, not too salty and had the little mushrooms in it. 
The tempura was fresh and crispy. The bulgogi was hearty and plentiful.
I was not the biggest fan of the iceberg lettuce salad.

It was filling lunch. A decent amount of food for $10.95 ($12.37 with tax).

The owner Charlie was very rushed as the restaurant was busy, so we didn't get much service. But I'd re-visit this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, mediocre miso soup, and friendly service.  A little on the pricey side, but that was offset by the free yam tumpura (yum!).  Dark, woody interior gives it a comfy, homey feel (complete with chatty regulars!)."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi, sashimi and friendly service.
Decent prices and it's not noisy!
My sashimi boat was ample and fresh with a large assortment of sashimi, not just 4 different items.
Also had a hand roll which was excellent. The salad that came with the sashimi was a large bowl, not the tiny bowl of salad like at most places and the miso soup was quite different although lacking the seaweed usually found in them."}
{"text":"By far one the best sushi places I've been too! Cozy and relaxed atmosphere Charlie will be sure to take care of you! Make sure you get the saki bombs they're the best! Best spot in town!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible 
Indiscreet ( don't go wi a new girlfriend 
He'll tell your steady. He , despite being the son of the owner should not be allowed to be ma√ÆtreD , sushi need funeral, dumplings hard and greasy all else greasy and Dull
Avoid"}
{"text":"This place has good quality sushi at an acceptable price. The lunch boat for two ($30) is one of my favorites. The service is extremely friendly yet unfortunately often amateur. Over the past couple years they have had a few servers that barely understood English. They will very often screw up an order. I suggest sitting at the sushi bar to take out the middle man - the sushi chef is very experienced and never screws up. If you can't sit at the sushi bar make sure you point to items on the menu as you order them or there is a very good chance you will not get what you wanted. This place would have scored much higher if service errors were not so common."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an unbelievable menu and Charlie takes care of everyone.  I took clients who had been there and we just asked for a plate to share for 4 people.

Charlie picked everything out, nothing deep fried, and the flavor was excellent.
This truly is a place to go if you like Japanese.   Excellent food and service"}
{"text":"I have made this my regular sushi spot. The food is consistantly good an fresh, and they make an extra effort to make your experience enjoyable. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as my office is nearby.  Took my team there for a team lunch.  I have had better experiences there before my most recent experience was disappointing.  I ordered an expensive 'Love' boat filled with rolls and sashimi.  The rolls were ok, as expected.  The sashimi was disappointing in terms of portion as it was paper thin.  It is as if they split one regular piece into four pieces.  Ended up still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef and rice dish for take away. When I took it home I opened it and there wasn't even one piece of beef!  There was a little steamed rice with some shredded lettuce and a thin slice of cucumber. What kind of a joke is that for $15! As well I noticed from the limited menu that everything was over priced."}
{"text":"Most amazing.
So fresh.
Worth every penny.
Been to too many disappointing sushi places this one does not let you down."}
