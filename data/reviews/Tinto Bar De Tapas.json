{"text":"Service was awful. Food was very good.  Took forever to get food.  Waiter didn't speak english; was rude."}
{"text":"Place is small good ambient though. . waiters are kind and servicing. Pricey for the smallest amount of food you've ever imagined. I do not think I will go back there."}
{"text":"The menu has a good variety and all of the items we tried were very tasty.  The tapas style where you order small appetizer size dishes allow you to try a lot of different dishes  which can be a lot more interesting and a nice change from the standard three course dinner.  A couple of dishes we enjoyed were the garlic shrimp and chorizo mussels.  We also ordered the meat and cheese platter.  I was worried with the continuous ordering that our bill would be high.  In the end, dinner for four plus tax and tip (no alcohol) was $185 which we thought was reasonable.  Service was good - knowledgeable and friendly.  Recommend to all."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Will come back frequently and eat our way through the menu. Over just the past few years, Spanish food in Toronto has finally come into its own. ¡Olé!"}
{"text":"Very average. Food is very salty, not worth the price (small portions). I went for dinner and ordered 3 tapas and shared a bottle of wine. Would not go for dinner again, might stop by for a quick drink and appetizer on my way out"}
{"text":"Came here with another couple on their recommendation. Really cool decor on the inside. Kitchen was in the dining room, there was minimal ventilation so it got very warm inside very quickly to the point where it was uncomfortable.  The red when we ordered was way too  warm due to the temperature inside the restaurant. They had the windows/doors open but breeze was minimal.   Would recommend them turning on their a/c or at least the hvac for some circulated air. 

Food was ok. Some things were better than others. Mushroom toast was the favourite of the 8 dishes we ordered.  Of the seafood we tried, shrimp was delicious on one dish and not so fresh on the fried dish.  We also ordered the smelt which looked appetizing but wasn't great.  

Service was ok, our servers seemed a little bit out of it, giving us bread half way through our meal, that seems to have been meant to be brought at the beginning.  Who knows maybe the kitchen and service was having an off night. Would be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"The service, atmosphere and food was great here. It's a quaint shop with fresh food. The orders are made to order and you can watch them make it. It is run by a few people so it is a great place to go and hangout with friends and have an easy night over good food and drinks. Don't come here if you are in a rush and want to eat and run. To have an amazing experience, relax and enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"Would give a 4 star because the flavours are good, but our last dish took more than an hour to come! The worst part was when I complained to the server at the end, she gave us a huge attitude and pushed all the responsibility to the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. 5th time and always good.  Get Madjul dates and arroz con carne. Great service, great wine. Super fun for a date or girls night out"}
{"text":"If you have been to authentic tapa's restaurants aboard then you will enjoy this. The food was great and you got enough tapas portions. Service was also great and timely. I went with my husband and we got the Chorizo..the best part! The beef scewers, the Empanadas and the Shrimp. They were all amazing and I recommend getting those. However, DO NOT order the Paella! It's $26, its very  small and its not good at all. It is not an authentic Spanish Paella. It tasted like friend rice   with fish on top. It didnt have that flavor or texture that I had back in Spain. Granted you can't compare Toronto to Spain but I have had good Paella at Joeys for half the price so it is possible. The Paella was a huge let down and it had me considering giving this place 3 stars instead of 4. Put it this way...Fried rice from any chinese food place for $4 would have been better. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"A very fine meal with good service (though the next table over was unhappy with the lack of waitstaff attention). The four of us ordered 8 tapas and 2 desserts, all excellent, especially patatas bravas, meatballs, shrimp and salads. Wine was reasonably priced and a bill at $200 incl tip seemed just right. We'll be back."}
{"text":"They recently changed their concept to Swiss Fare. Wow. Simply amazing. The presentation and most importantly the quality of the food was outstanding. Good attentive service without constant hovering. Good wine list to match. But the food is just in a class of its own. Inspires me to visit Switzerland and see if the food there is as good as my experience here. Kudos to the chef at this establishment for cooking with character and passion."}
{"text":"Ordered Fajitas, everything was just right, tortilla, vegetables and cheese. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Spectacular!!! Finally a cool and trendy spot in our neighborhood with a team of staff that anyone would love to dine with! Do not leave the restaurant without trying the Dates - stuffed with cheese and wrapped in crispy bacon - are you drooling yet?! Everything on the menu is fantastic (yes, I've tried it all, over several visits of course). Owned by a sommelier no less, so the wines are a fabulous addition to the perfect meal!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was mediocre, salty and overpriced. There are way better options on bayview to have a good meal."}
{"text":"Service was non existent. 10 minutes to just get water.  another 20 minutes to get wine. Had to look for someone to take an order 20minutes after getting wine. Tables are very close together that you can hear every conversation around you. Food was hit and miss. They just dropped off the dishes and no one came by to check on us again. I do not go to a restaurant to be ignored all night. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"This place first welcomes you with a fun decor mixing chalk board menus, flashy red flooring and rustic wood tables, setting the tone for a non-pretentious bistro style ambiance that is way too rare in this area. 

The open kitchen will allow you to get a glance at what's cooking and say hi to the welcoming Chef. While you will find some traditional spanish tapas on the floor to ceiling wall menu, expect some of them to be spiked with a personalized twist to tease your taste buds. 

Everyone was very friendly and went above and beyond to show me a good time while I had to wait for the rest of my party to arrive... For quite a while :) 

Looking forward to coming back here soon."}
