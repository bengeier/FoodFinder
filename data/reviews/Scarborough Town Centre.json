{"text":"Actually this is a warning for people who park at the public parking lot in Scarborough Town Center. I went there this afternoon and parked my car outside of Walmart at about 2:30pm, and saw an officer writing parking ticket for a car nearby. I was surprised as this is apparently a common public parking lot for these kind of shopping malls, and there were no signs saying no parking or whatsoever.  So I went to the officer and asked if I can park my car there, and he said yes. I went to Walmart and did my shopping and came out one hour later, and guess what? I got a parking ticket on my windshield citing I parked in a private property without consent. The ticket was written at 2:35pm, just minutes after I confirmed with the officer upon arrival. I am not the only one. I saw there were a few others cars with parking tickets too here and there in that huge parking lot. I was pretty upset, and went to the security office in the mall at about 6:30 (after a movie). The lady officer there said that they chalked the tires and give parking tickets for cars that parked for more than 4 hours. I told her this must be a mistake because I've only parked for one hour and showed her all the receipts. I almost had to beg and she asked me to come back in 20 minutes. I was pretty determined to dispute this thing, so I just stood outside the security door and waited. She came out just moments later and took my parking ticket and told me not to worry about it. I guess I was pretty lucky this time as I had the time to deal with it. You guys really gotta be careful when parking there - take evidence of when you started parking there and when you leave. I'm really not sure why they are so big on giving parking tickets there in the middle of a Friday. There were plenty of parking spaces where I and many other cars got the tickets."}
{"text":"Worker at Michael Kors pushed me and told me to move. She could have asked nicely.  Didn't even face me. Overall,I like STC."}
{"text":"As 'the' mall in the Scarborough region of Toronto it isn't bad. It covers two floors and has a circular floor layout, so it's easy to see every store without going back on yourself. It recently underwent a significant rehaul and so is pretty nice and shiny right now. They also upgraded all their toilets in the refurbishment, which as a patron is great news.    Has all the basic stores as well as some more unique ones. The food court is also pretty good - two floors with a wide selection. Seating is a bit of a challenge when it's really busy. Parking lot is a bit chaotic, mostly because of the many entrances and odd layout of the mall itself. Recently the outlying areas of the mall have had some stores put in, so if you're looking for the bigger box stores they may be outside the actual mall. Also on the outskirts are some of the bigger restaurants, Moxies, Jack Astors, Canyon Creek, and Swiss Chalet for a few.    The mall itself has all three big stores - Walmart, Sears, and the Bay."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I was younger. Good selection of stores and food! It's gotten way too busy and bigger in the past few years, so that's annoying."}
{"text":"This is my home mall. Aritzia, Lululemon, great foodcourt, Booster Juice, PINK, Aldo, Rickis, Menxocino, Sears, The Bay, Browns, Spring,..what isn't to love at this mall?!"}
{"text":"The shops are what you would expect anywhere you go like Walmart foot locker etc... All same, im however disappointed by the food court, WAAAAAY OVERPRICED. BIG RIP OFF, I work close so I could go there to eat but..... 9$-11$ for footlong sub, everything is over 10bucks and the only affordable food is Mc Donald's which has a HUGE line always. Food is expensive and portions small and stingey. I feel like they may even manipulate prices at certain times of day since all menus are on monitors and I swear after 5pm I saw cheaper prices then at lunch. SCAM TOWN CENTER."}
{"text":"Only been here once; and didnt go around too much since it was a quick grab food an go cause i had a meeting to attend, the layout was reaaally nice! It was bright an colourful an a lot of people were there! I can say that it looks a lot appealin then yorkdale an eatons an such! But thats possible cause im mainly downtown an not uptown so my bias judgement can't really comprehend. It's like meeting a new person you want to get to know it better an it's more interesting. Other then that it's a destination i'll keep an eye out for in the near future since it caught my attention Asap!"}
{"text":"More high end stores now. Not sure if that's a smart idea since it's Scarborough.   Construction near the food court is driving everyone insane."}
{"text":"This is a review for Obsessions Jewellery in the STC. I posted it on their page but it looks like it's largely unvisited and I wanted to make sure STC and its customers are aware of this situation and don't waste their money and be treated horribly at the same time.  DO NOT SHOP AT THIS STORE We purchased a gold necklace there 6 months ago from Obsession Jewellers that has since fallen apart- I don't mean broke, I mean, fallen apart into pieces. The staff was incredibly rude, asked my daughter to move, to not speak to other customers (who were complaining about their own broken products) and ultimately that they would do nothing for her other than for her to purchase another chain from them with a percentage off. Why would we want to spend more money there? When the combative staff remarked that they did not know what happened to the chain and they hadn't seen anything like it before they accused my daughter of somehow breaking apart every link on it herself! She went to another large, chain jewelry store in the mall and asked the manager there if he might know what could cause such a breakage in the chain. Luckily, he had worked in manufacturing previously and said he did know what was wrong and he explained that it is a manufacturing default whereby the chain was not reinforced/sautered properly.  When this was explained to the assistant manager at Obsessions she refused to listen, accused my daughter of \"rolling the chain in her hand and pulling it apart\" (??!!) and raised her voice to her. My daughter was on the phone with me the entire time and I overheard the entire exchange. My daughter was treated so poorly that I am in tears over it. How can it be okay to have tenants that raise their voices to minors- paying customers? I cannot get the manager's name or contact information so I am forced to take this to social media and to try to pursue this further. This is not trying to get \"something free\", this is about misrepresentation, disrespect and outright thievery (when you pay for something and you do not get the product you paid for, you have in effect, been robbed). I will not be letting this go. How much easier would it have been to just treat customers with respect and then talk to the manufacturer you hold the contract with to right this wrong? I await management response. (The management who's contact information would not be shared at the time of the issue). PS: There were 2 other sets of customers in this store at the time complaining and attempting restitution for faulty products."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends, and I find just about anything I need in the mall. Most of the prices are moderate compared to another local mall. There's plenty of security guards, which is always a plus, and they're friendly and helpful as well. It can get quite rowdy and crowded on the weekends and during holidays, though."}
{"text":"Really nice shopping mall. Has some good shops and department stores. Bay and Sears are good. There is the usual stores like Gap, Disney Store etc but also some really cool restaurants like Moxies. I would really recommend that place. Food and service is really good."}
{"text":"Good for some things, like a Walmart and some interesting shoe options. I wouldn't recommend this mall if you're looking for higher end things. The Sears here is Gawdawful. The general crowd you see here is locals, mostly teens and young adults due to the colleges/universities within a stones throw. Not great eats at the food court, just a very mainstream selection. Two Tim's and two Mcdonalds, if you include the Walmart mcDs.  I come here when I need to grab stuff last minute, as it's on my commute through the Scarborough Centre RT station/bus station."}
{"text":"I've realized that the reviews for this long time GTA/Toronto mall are fairly split between 3 and 4 stars, and to be fair I've gotta agree, my rating sits approximately at 3.5 stars. With Yorkdale/Sherway being an example of a 5 star and Hilcrest or Cloverdale Mall being examples of 1-2 star spots.   Despite what others may say the selection here is slightly better than average, with a high number of anchor stores, certain specialty shops and name brands shops (Steve Madden) that aren't super common.   Layer on it's massive size, two floors of retail, huge foodcourt and movie theatre and you've got an above average shopping experience.   Another huge perk is the high accessibility of this mall whether you are taking Subway, Bus, LRT/RT or driving, it's the terminus of many public transportation lines and a central hub for others. From a driving perspective it's easily accessible from HWY 401. Also there is no shortage of parking so for those driving it's a much easier option than Yorkdale for shopping along 401.   I think that's most surprising about SCT is that I had written it off years ago as ghetto mall (my apologies for the prejudice), I can safely say this is a top 5 mall in the Toronto GTA area.  With the holidays coming you might want to check out this place purely on selection."}
{"text":"I always go to the Scarborough town center ! It's a nice please lots of different shops. The food court is big but the thing that I don't like is that there's a lot of Indian Food in the food court ! But over all it's a nice please especially this store called Caribbean Queen these sell amazing food it's really good"}
{"text":"Oh STC. I hadn't seen you in 10 years...how you've changed! This mall is so busy all the time! Been here a couple times since I moved and it doesn't matter what day, it's pure parking insanity. I recommend parking near the Bay.  It's definitely a thriving mall. All stores seem to be full of people all the time. Not only is there a lot inside the mall, there's also many stores and restaurants surrounding it, just in case you didn't find what you're looking for."}
{"text":"This place has definitely changed when compared to the days I used to shop here as a High Schooler, yet intrinsically remains almost the same. Guess because in the end, the shape of the overall place has not changed, mostly just the stores come and go or play musical chairs with their locations over the years.   I do not come here as much as before since I live downtown and you know, there better be a good reason to head to Scarborough Town Center when I could as easily and conveniently go to at least 3-4 malls that are far closer to me. In fact, I mostly drop by to STC simply because I now have friends who live in nearby condos and this is a good play to drop-by and pick some cheap and fast food on-the-go.  I am happy that although it took them almost 20 years, this place has been able to shed most of its ghetto-fabulous-on-a-low-to-middle-class-budget-vibe. Earning a bit of sheen through what I assume is the gentrification of the surrounding areas. From open fields and horrible strip mall restaurants and big box stores, to pretty much still the same: strip mall restaurants and big box stores WITH expensive condos and townhouses next to them.    The mall greatly benefits from being steps from the TTC and GO Bus stations, so if you live in Scarborough and don't feel like going downtown, North York or to Markham for your mall shopping needs, well, it really helps business when you are pretty much the biggest and only real player in the borough.   Me thinks that by now, you have gotten that I am not much of a mall consumer, and that I only go to malls when I absolutely have to, so in the end, the STC is far from being terrible and I highly recommend it if you live in the hood. I rate STC at 8 \"At-least-is-not-Shops-At-Aura\" out of 10.   Check it out. You might find a few stores you like."}
{"text":"I work close by and come here almost every day at least once so naturally I've never completed a Yelp review but here it is.  A few years ago, the property owners Oxford went on a spending spree of $60+ million to spruce things up; more natural lighting from rooftop windows, new flooring, redesign of the upper and lower food courts, new restrooms, etc.  Three anchor stores where here (Walmart, Hudson's Bay and Sears) but two remain.  Cineplex is also a big draw.  The TTC and GO Transit operate from this mall and the new $3 Billion Scarborough Subway design appears that it's gaining traction as a replacement for the really old LRT line from Kennedy Station.  Anyhow, STC mall is morphing into an upscale venue with the departure of certain lower image stores like Bulk Barn; I'm surprised Dollarama remains even as the leases rose to pay for the mall facelift.  Over 250 businesses to serve this community and it's also a great place to complete my power walk daily exercise routine!"}
{"text":"I like Scarborough Town Centre, it's a nice big mall with lots of different stores.  The upper level floor plan is like a figure 8 with some off shoots and the lower level is a circle with some off shoots.  The anchor stores are The Bay, Sears, and Walmart.  They have the usual stores like Laura, Melanie Lyne, Reitmans, Soft Moc, etc.  But they also have some less usual stores like a P.J's Pet Centre and a place called Sweet Tooth Emporium (which is like Sugar Mountain except better, since they sell candies and chocolates from lots of different countries, not just the UK).  They also have a Bulk Barn and a Dollarama.    There is a nice large food court on the upper level that has the usual Taco Bell, KFC, Tim Hortons, Manchu Wok, New York Fries, etc., but they also have the less popular Caribbean Queen, Koryo Korean Barbeque, and Koya Japan.  The lower level has a small \"food court\" with a Tim Hortons and a McDonald's.  Yes, there are 2 Tim Hortons in the mall.  The lower food court smells like cigarette smoke, so I try to avoid it.      If you are from out of town and are reading reviews to see if this would be a good place to shop, I think it would be.  If I lived in Scarborough, I would likely go here often.  I don't think it's necessarily worth the drive from Toronto proper though, because it doesn't really have any stores that you can't find in Toronto.  But if you want a change of scenery from the usual Yorkdale, Eaton Centre, Dufferin Mall, PATH underground, etc. it's good for that."}
{"text":"They have what you would expect from a mall, stores like Walmart, footlocker, etc. My problem is the food court is WAAAY OVERPRICED. I work close by and a footlong subs about $10-12$, most things at lunch are over 10 bucks and it's true there is a Mc Donald's but the line is always YUUUUUGE. I also think they manipulate prices at different times of the day, lunch is a rip-off but ive gone after 5pm and things seam cheaper, since menus are on LCD screens its easy to manipulate it. VERY ANNOYING PLACE and ask someone at Walmart where to find something and you will get no answer as they don't know much at all if they even speak English. BRUTALLY ANNOYING!"}
{"text":"It's SCARBOROUGH YO!  ;) no problems with this mall, I shop here often, they have really renovated and fixed the place up over the years.  I think most people who haven't been to this mall in a while would be surprised at how much nicer it is, and that the store selections are pretty decent.  I like to go to Starbucks or Davids tea and then continue my shopping adventures.  It is also surrounded by a few Plaza's within walking distance (with Restaurants &  Clothing/Jewelry /Loblaws superstore &  don't forget the Movie theater) and has buses and R.T and Go stops right to the mall :)   Don't hate, it's a decent mall."}
{"text":"Great location with access to transit that is easy to navigate.   Huge food court and theatre.   Good selection of stores and brands.   Great atmosphere and the staff who man the guest services and mall maps are really, really helpful."}
{"text":"The nicest part of Scarborough quite frankly.   I suspect that the police station and large amount of security guards are responsible for that one.  Go to one of the bars in the parking lot   Go see a movie   Go get your hair cut (provided you were not overdoing it at the bar)  Go to the spa and wax your harry back  Go buy just about anything there.  If it had any more it would be creepy like the Edmonton mall."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what to say about Scarborough Town.  It's been a staple location within scarborough and well know for it. It has it fair share of everything from big name restaurant like Milestone and Jack Astors to your main department stores, Bay, Walmart and Sears (yup still around despite the Eaton Center one closed)  You have your basic from Shoppers Drugmart, Eb Game, Payless.  Store like Bently, Browns and others.  Well known clothing stores like Old Navy, Gap, Guess, American Eagle, while most of this store arent exclusive to Scarborough Town.  We have other feature, like a large food court, movie theatre that is pretty good, and connect right to the ttc like most major malls   It's best  mall in Scarborough and maybe even the GTA, it probably up there in my top 5. It's Probably slighly better then Fairview Mall but doesnt measure up to say Yorkdale"}
{"text":"Super convenient.   Located walking distance from my Mom and Aunts Canada apartments. This mall has everthing I need and then some.   Most importantly there is a Tim Hortons! In fact there are 2. I'm obsessed with the Iced Capp and they do a heck of a job at these two locations. Both are ALWAYS packed.   My favorite candy store in here would have to be Bulk Barn. Whenever I'm visiting, I make sure to take back loads of mini gummy bears for friends and family. They offer a large variety of goodies and at reasonable prices.   They have a \"Dollar\" Store in here called Dollarama that I adore. Not everything is a buck but most of it is. Loads of neat things. Probably one of the larger dollar stores I've been to. This place is my GO TO for some cheap dish washing liquid or other household item I may need for the apartment.   There is a Walmart in this mall as well. My go to spot for cheap phone cards. The prices are a bit higher here than the Walmarts in the US on some items.   The Food Court is great. Better than a lot of other food courts I've been to. They have a Ten Ren's Tea, so you can get your bubble tea fix. Two of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat at the Food Court are Villa Madina and Michel's Baguette. There is a TD Bank inside as well.   My favorite time to walk around this mall would be early in the day. As it gets later, I find it a bit too crazy for me. It gets way too crowded. The mall is walking distance from the GO Transit, Voyageur, Greyhound and the T.T.C. There are loads of apartment buildings near by as well as office buildings.   Don't be surprised at the madness. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Checked out the new Taste Market at STC!! Was also surprised that they are now renovating the entire upstairs and its so empty there.  Taste Market looks soooo nice and definitely a huge upgrade from before. I also thought it'd be bigger (as per photos) but it's fine. Taste Market also has new seats and cute booths too! There's a bigger variety of restaurants now!  Chipotle, Miio Sandwiches (Viet), Cultures, Manchu Wok, Carribean Queen, Thai Express, Wasabi (japanese), Real Fruit bubble tea, along w KFC, McDonalds, Taco Bell are some of the stores I can remember.   I loved the new selections, booths and the new food court of STC..  But why 3 stars?  The booths are covered with flies! :( . The first booth had about 5 flies surrounding the booth.. And when moving onto the 2nd booth in another area, it has flies flying about as well.... Which really disgusted me. It's house flies, not fruit flies.  Ended up just sitting at a normal seat but even while eating, some of the flies came over and it was just nasty :( .   There was ample cleaners about but the flies just made the entire experience lower the overall rating.  Washrooms were also a unique experience. They have males, females, family washrooms along with a new implemented co-gender washroom!  Mostly the flies issue caused the bad part in this experience. Other malls doesn't have this issue so Im wondering why STC does - as it didn't have it before as well.   Hope this gets solved soon somehow because I like the new STC food court and would linger there more if I wasn't so annoyed at the flies :/"}
{"text":"Located in the far east fringes of Toronto, the Scarborough Town Centre is a large mall that caters mainly to residents and suburbanites living near or in Scarborough or East Toronto. Large, spacious, clean and convenient to public transportation (the Scarborough Town Centre RT station is located just right outside the entrance leading to the food court), the mall`s main flagship stores are The Bay, Sears, and Walmart.  Not frequented too often by tourists due to it`s location, the store is airy, clean and has a large food court, but lacks the excitement and energy malls like the Eaton Centre is well known for.  High recommended to those wanting to check out The Bay, especially after that company announced that they will be closing their locations in downtown Toronto and replacing them with Saks Fifth Avenue, it`s a great place to spend a lazy weekend afternoon shopping or simply browsing around."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, it is the closest mall to us, but man is it ever full now, I don't bother going to the food court anymore, there are never any seats, the whole mall is getting nearly impossible to navigate, there are just too many people.  Recently, the mall has added a few stores, this has allows the place to look like every other mall, it has absolutely nothing that distinguishes it from other malls.   Avoid this place until they figure out how to deal with crowds."}
{"text":"This is a.great placw to go for fun or practical needs.Though youmay want other store locations in mind, as they might not have everything."}
{"text":"I come here weekly if not more. I really love the ample parking. The mall is clean. I always see staff walking around cleaning. I love the Hudson's Bay here. It's so beautiful and modern.  Lots of restaurants around the mall as well. I grocery shop at superstore often. It's perfect if I have to run into the mall for something. I can grab groceries on the way out. I do wish there was a LCBO in the plaza.  The underground parking at Walmart is dated. I don't park there. (Seems a little shifty at night.) The other parking areas are well lit and I feel safe.  Lots of stores are being renovated in the mall. Hello new Lululemon. I really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"My opinion of this mall is slightly biased because I met my girlfriend here! Scarborough Town has everything you'd want with stores like: Walmart, The Bay, Sears, Dollarama, Shoppers Drug Mart, HMV. Great Cineplex theater upstairs with tons of games.  The mall tends to get pretty jammed on Fridays, you've been warned! Food court is currently undergoing a major overhaul so stay tuned."}
{"text":"Not a fan, it seemed like the food I got was old and stale.  When I asked for a cup of water they said they were all out, which is a lie because their was a lady in front of me who just got one.  Overall there are many of other restaurants in the town centre that have better food."}
{"text":"Solid shopping options. Frightening parking lot."}
{"text":"Brief Intro:  Scarborough Town Centre is centrally located near the BUSY highway 401, in-between Brimley road and McCowan road.  It has an Upper Bowl and a Lower Bowl where majority of the Food Court is on top, just follow your nose to the delicious Curry smell from Tandori(Fast Food).  By no surprise, there is Toronto Police Services along side the Security Office.  It also has the convenience of a Wal-Mart and a nearby Real Canadian Superstore for your grocery shopping needs.  Seating Comfort Level:(**---)  The seats here are wooden bench seating with hard green metallic arms.  Advantage is that it has backs for leaning but far from a comfortable lounging environment.   I guess there was NEVER a seat budget when they renovate this place year after year.  However long you are able to sit down at a TTC bench without any ass-damage is however long you should be sitting on these eye sores.  Safety Zone:(****-)  Safety Zone at STC is wide ranging from the point of the SportChek & Famous Players entrance to the TTC entrance.  For a short visit, staying within this region is plenty enjoyable and MOST people do just visit this stretch as they go from TTC through to the Food Court towards the Parking Lot and vice versa.  I like to call this zone the 'Wallet Saver' zone because the Upper Bowl consists of Famous Players, Sport Chek, Old Navy, and Food Court while the Lower Bowl consists of the much appreciated Bulk Barn & Everything for a Dollar combination along with Tim Hortons and McDonalds.  If you do plan on passing this Safety Zone, PLEASE go down the escalators at the Upper Bowl Food Court point or else if you go for the escalators at the Centre Court it becomes hazardous.  Walking from the Food Court towards the Centre Court escalator on the Upper Bowl, the direct line-of-vision is at the deadly Birks/Swarozski side-by-side 1-2 punch.  Hopefully you can lure them towards Godiva instead.    Beyond this point on there's not much you can do but strategically choose your path as best as possible once you are on the lower level.  At Centre Court, walk left if your group isn't into Young & Hip(Sephora, Mac, Garage Clothing, La Senza, Spring, Aeropostale) and walk right if your group isn't Sophisticated Chic(Urban Behavior, Le Chateau, Jacob Connexion, Mexx, Danier, R.W., Peoples, Fine Gold), Good Luck!  Exit Strategy:(****-)  The best spot is at the end of the Upper Bowl Food Court where you'll see GAP and Second Cup, or follow your nose to a Popcorn smell(Kernels).  It gives an option of going towards the TTC Light Rail Transit, towards the internals of the mall, and towards the exit of the Famous Players end.  You can also decide to go down a level towards the Toronto Police if things turn UGLY.  Another reason is that this is the HIGH traffic area where everyone converges and you'll even see Police and Security around this zone from time to time.  If you need a quick escape just bland into the sea of people as if you're at New York Times Square.  Entertainment Level:(*----)  Unfortunately not much entertainment points to give out here either unless you like that whole people watching scene from the comforts of the limited seating at the food court.  I would suggest that a good place to sneak off is still within the Safety Zone.  Famous Players has an ARCADE area however be prepared for that years-old Popcorn stench that is forever hidden inside the theatre's carpets.  More suggestions are EB Games, Black's, The Source, HMV."}
{"text":"This place is your generic mall. It's right by the subway and happened to be packed on a Thursday night at six o'clock. There are the typical mall stores like Old Navy and Forever 21. AThe food court is pretty large. If you're in the east end and you need to pick up something from chain stores, Scarborough Town Centre is your best choice.  Good for: shopping, eating out"}
{"text":"Scarborough Town Centre definitely renovated in the past few years making it a very popular spot in Scarborough on weekends and Friday nights.  First off, Scarborough Town Centre is extremely convenient as several modes of transportation hits Scarborough Town. For example, there are routes for post-secondary schools, Downtown Toronto, Markham, etc. In addition, it is one of the prime centres of the ttc and this is one of the stops for Line 3 of the subway line, several ttc buses, Go Buses and I believe even greyhounds.  The mall itself definitely renovated. It has a beautiful food court with many food options now - comparable to the food courts designed by Cadillac Fairview Malls, a few popular and trendy foodie stores, and not to mention their theatre which used to have one of the best designs (in my personal opinion) in all of the GTA! Of course, it's a little older now, but for the record, I love their open concept and design!  Parking is limited to shoppers as the parking spaces open when the mall opens and closes around when the mall closes, so don't think of dropping your car off here and taking the subway - you'll either be locked in or won't be able to get a spot!"}
{"text":"Love this mall as it has all the stores I need and more. Also love that unlike other malls, they've got a mix between both high-end and affordable stores to choose from. The recent renovations to the food court are awesome and modernizes the vibe of the mall. They've also got a big Cineplex movie theatre attached to the mall and I like how the mall is basically attached to Scarborough Centre station so you don't need to walk outside to get to the entrance of the mall."}
{"text":"This review is done from what I seen of Scarbro Town Centre. I never got to shop to judge the stores/customer service but from window shopping around as this was my first time at the mall, with all the renovations coming thru, it's above average mall. It gets judged a lot because of the location but hey, Yorkdale isnt in the greatest area either.  It's a 2 floor mall with all the stores we are used too. It's kind of like dufferin mall meets yorkdale to me because of the dollarama, Walmart of dufferin mall but high ends of forever 21, Victoria secret of yorkdale. Lots of stores, from clothing, home decor, few restaurants like Moxies,  jewelry and even a movie theatre on the left side of the mall entrance. The forever 21, is prolly the largest one I have seen in any mall, it's just huge especially in comparison to the one by dundas square. It's on the right side of the mall entrance. There's 2 food courts, one upstairs and downstairs, lots of options, you will know where it is by following the heavy greasy but tasty smells.  Outside of the mall, there's tons of restaurants, Baton Rouge, Jack Astors, Kelsey's etc Mainstream bars/restaurants we know of. Lots of parking space as well and if you drive a bit down on Progress Ave, you will see the Great Canadian Superstore on your right side for grocery needs."}
{"text":"I don't live in Scarborough, but visit family here. I really like this mall, it's huge and has tons! of options. I'm from NYC where malls are non-existent, so finding a huge place like this is awesome! It's close to public transport, and have a huge food court. I like all the little stores in this place. You can really do some damage to your bank account shopping here. I like the clothing and shoes stores but their bedding and furniture products are subpar. It seems pretty convenient, always visit this place when I'm in Scarborough."}

Layer on it's massive size, two floors of retail, huge foodcourt and movie theatre and you've got an above average shopping experience.   STC is accessible by car, TTC and GO bus, the terminal is a main stop for transferring between services.   A lot of renovations have been done to the Mall over the years. With that a lot of better shops too moved in: Lululemon, H & M, Victoria Secrets, DavidsTea, Indigo just to name a few.  Not only that, STC has recently gotten a ton of restaurants in the area -- Boston Pizza, Canyon Creek Chophouse, Moxie's, Jack's Astor's, Milestone's, and the Canadian class, Swiss Chalet. And the theatre usually has a decent selection of movies -- not to mention that on Tuesdays, movies are only $4.99!

But during the weekday before 3pm it's quieter and less crowded with mall rats coming from school and blocking the escalators. The workers at the stores are generally nice and helpful.   The upper level floor plan is like a figure 8 with some off shoots and the lower level is a circle with some off shoots.  The anchor stores are The Bay, Sears, and Walmart.  They have the usual stores like Laura, Melanie Lyne, Reitmans, Soft Moc, etc.  But they also have some less usual stores like a P.J's Pet Centre and a place called Sweet Tooth Emporium (which is like Sugar Mountain except better, since they sell candies and chocolates from lots of different countries, not just the UK).  They also have a Bulk Barn and a Dollarama."}
{"text":"Well the mall it self has certainly changed since I was a kid! The movie theater had toonie Tuesday. I remember when Scarborough City Hall was here, it almost seems like a lifetime ago.   Of course all the changed that have happen I fee have been to make the mall bigger and better. which is great, the stores have certainly changed a lot over the years. The selection of retailers has also improved in my opinion, there are more trendier places now. Even the existing retails have made changes to their stores, to make them look more trendier. Like the phone companies(Telus, Bell)  they are certainly have a more modern hip tech look to them.   Still a great place to shop, visit, eat or spend a day in."}
{"text":"You might call this mall ghetto being in the heart of Scarborough but this has always been my go to mall as it has a bit of everything.   The recent renovations have modernized the overall look on the inside. New stores are moving in and older ones have remodeled.  Surrounding the mall outside are a variety of stores (Best Buy, Addition Elle, Furniture Barn and Loblaws SuperStore) and Resturants (Boston Pizza, Canyon Creek, Baton Rouge, Swiss Chalet and Jack Astor's) and a movie theatre."}
{"text":"I much prefer going to this mall rather than my local.  There is such a wide selection of stores and absolutely everything I need is all in one spot (including the surrounding stores).  Not only is the shopping convenient but there is also a TTC / RT & GO terminal just over the bridge from the food court which makes it one of the easiest malls to get to!"}
{"text":"????????????GO STATION?????????????CIVIC CENTRE???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This mall has had major renovations in the last few years, all kicked off with the new and improved food court.  Better lighting and food choices and seating.  It still gets packed but what can you do - it's a really popular mall.  Slowly this mall is gaining more \"it\" stores - Sephora, David's Tea, Micheal Kors, Calvin Klein, Victoria's Secret (remember waaaay back in the day when you had to drive to Buffalo to get some VS stuff?!!), Vince Camuto....and the list goes on and on.  New sky lights let lots of light in so it doesn't feel dark and dingy as in the days gone by.  Plenty of parking and lots of restaurants border the mall (Jack Astors, Baton Rouge, Swiss Chalet, Moxies which is actually inside the mall).  There is also a Walmart here.  Pretty much a one stop shop.  Good selection of high and low end stores.  They just opened up an Apple accessories store (it's pretty big!).  I always try to go on a weekday morning as it gets packed with teenagers once done school or early on the weekends.  The LRT runs right into the mall so it's TTC accessible."}
{"text":"Don't really know what to review about a mall so here goes nothing:  Great selection of stores and it seems to always be changing/ going through new renovations/ bringing on new retailers etc. It's a nice place to go if you're looking to get a gift but don't have a clue what to get someone.   The new food court has some great new additions and looks nice! Though they have a LOT of people coming through everyday, so I think maybe they should have expanded the seating area... so many people have trouble finding a place to sit and just over all cleaning ediquette there is lacking, compared to other malls that are clear on how trays/ trash should be treated after you're done eating...  They need serious security upgrades.. I've seen people just hanging out in the parking lots for an hour or two... don't know if they're waiting for someone to leave a car unlocked, or they just really like parking lots? There's been a few incidents, but nice to see they have security at the busiest entrances here.  They also should probably do some more cleaning... floors are often sticky..same with benches... and washrooms for sure. It's a busy mall, so they should really keep up!  It's a really busy mall usually with easy access from highway or local transit. Huge space with two floors and a theatre at the end there. Parking can be a nightmare, but just be patient.. people come and go all the time.  Good mall to visit once in a while & can't wait for the updates!"}
{"text":"I am here several times a month, sometime to shop at the reasonably priced stores, sometime to see a movie in the comfy theater, sometimes just to eat some Yummy food in the updated food court.  No mater the reason this place is always a fav.  The parking is sometimes a hassle depending on the entrance that you are trying to park near.. But there is more then enough if you are patient and drive around a little."}
{"text":"I love this mall, I've come here ever since I was a kid. There have been a lot of renovations to this mall. I especially like the fact that the mall is so big and you can also get on the subway to go downtown from there.  In addition, there's a bunch of parking and restaurants in and around the mall. Jack Astors, Milestones, they even have a movie theatre inside the mall.  One of my favourite malls in the GTA, no doubt!  4/5."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends and just chill. The new renovations and stores really added more life to the place.  It's definitely one crowders than it was a couples years ago.   If you go, you just visit muji, and  Caribbean Queen  (food is delectable)"}
{"text":"The owners have really turned this mall around. What was once a dark, run-down excuse of a building is now bright, comfortable and sleek.  With Christmas 'around the corner', it's all decked out for the holidays with Christmas music and Santa. A great variety of stores covering all interests and budgets. A very large and expanding food court makes this not only good for shopping but also sitting down for a meal with friends.  Other big box stores in the mall are: Hudson's Bay Company, Sear's, Walmart, and Cineplex. Nearby are another collection of big box stores.  The mall overall is clean, not overly busy for a midday shopping trip. Honestly the busiest place was the food court.  If you are in the area and need something, this is a good spot to check for it. However, if your looking for touristy spots in Toronto, go to one of the others."}
{"text":"Everything about this mall is \"average.\"  Middle of the road store mix, middle level of architectural design (modernized recently but not really catchy), middle of the road food court.  Not a bad place to shop, just typical \"anywhere\" mall."}
{"text":"Consistently disappointing mall with little reason to come. The shops are all understocked and the food is all dirty.  The only joy to be found is when you finally get to leave this confusing jungle of garbage. Don't bother with the this place and head to fairview or yorkdale instead."}
{"text":"This mall is not for me at all. I am not a huge fan of malls so keep that in consideration for my review. I have been coming here for years and have found it's disappointing more then I'd like to. It's not awful it just however is rarely enjoyable to shop here. They have a pretty good selection of stores that I really enjoy but I find the mall in way too crowded with rude people. Most of the time and the staff of different stores I find not as friendly than other locations in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Good old stc. This mall has been around for ages.ttc accessible by bus and rt. this mall just had a make over the food court is now on the bottom level but they're still renovating the top part of the food court. It does seem less getto now that the renovations are in place. The shops are alright nothing high end. You don't expect to see stores like you see in Yorkdale. Very multicultural, and has good parking with parking garage.   I've grew up going here but I still prefer Markville as it's the same distance for me to go to both malls.  Markville seems less getto and more nicer stores. Let's see how stc will look after the renos"}
{"text":"STC wins stars for convenience, that's for sure. Home to the biggest bus terminal in Toronto, along with access to the Scarborough RT. Both are generally well used amongst shoppers.  However, aside from that, it's really nothing special despite the seemingly large size. The food court is one of the busiest and rowdiest I've seen, and getting a seat is about as equal of a challenge as fighting over parking spots at your local Chinese supermarket.  PS: There's free wifi here, but I've never been able to connect with it."}
{"text":"2.5 stars! I've been going to this mall since 2003. Let's just say while there are improvements and changes to the mall, I honestly still try to avoid at all costs. I only came to this mall because I had a mall gift card and I didn't want to travel all the way to Yorkdale. The Zara and the new sweet Jesus store is basically the only thing I come for. Just way too many people and food court is always packed! They renovated nicely but the food is just the same. Feels like prices went up a little though."}
{"text":"I've been to Scarborough Town Centre several times.  I'm usually there for the Moxie's restaurant.  It is a good mall with lots of stores, restaurants and a theatre.  It's close to the highway and there is also public transit nearby.  It's laid out well, and there is a lot of parking.  Plan to go early, the parking lot is usually very full in certain areas.  Plan on walking a good distance and time to drive around and look for parking spots.  Toronto is a big city with lots of people. If you like being around people, a lot of people, than this is a good place to go.  I'm not a big fan of being around a lot of people, or taking a lot of time to find a parking spot, or walking long distances to get where I need to go.  So, for me, I go sparingly, but I do like the variety of restaurants there, so I'm there from time to time.  ;)"}
{"text":"Has everything you need to spend your whole day here.  From outlet stores to retail and from grocery to movies they have everything.   The only drawback being the sears and the Bay Area, it seems like that area is under construction and gives me the feel of being in a cluttered space.  Rest everything is great. Must visit. And yes they have some amazing food in their food court"}
{"text":"I must admit that the renovations that STC went through came out very nice. Now all thats needed is to make the exterior of the store a bit more modernized an maybe a few different stores. One thing I do not like is the food court on the lower level, just too jam packed. But other than that it better than before"}
{"text":"Scarborough Town Centre is a pretty ordinary mall with a good amount of variety in what it has.  It has most of your basics like a Wal-Mart, a ton of clothing stores, Shoppers Drug Mart, jewelry stores, etc.  One thing to keep in mind with this place is that it's very busy for most every day of the week.  I've gone several times and no matter when I went, it was busy.  So you've been warned.  Parking on some of the sides, the movie theatre in particular, are crazy so I always park near Dollarama (Entrance number 7) whenever I go.  I almost always have to park in the sun but I don't mind walking a little extra for a \"for sure\" spot.  I can't imagine how busy this place is around Christmas time so you may want to go elsewhere for your Christmas shopping.  There's a bit of construction going on in the parking lot in two different locations so hopefully when it's done, it'll be a little less cluttered outside.  The inside is almost always very clean, which makes it look pretty nice.  One problem I have is that the food court is always full so if you're looking to go there and have lunch / dinner while shopping, you might have to search for a place to sit down to eat.  The places in the food court typically have pretty short lines but with people walking by all the time, it can get a little cluttered in there.  Just be careful when you have food with you.  Edit: One thing of note here is that they're doing some renovations around the food court area so the food court's even more crowded.  Based on what I've seen in the ads, it looks like it's going to be amazing when it's done but until then, it's a bit of a mess.  Scarborough Town Centre has a lot of different stores with good variety and is kept reasonably clean inside and out.  I could recommend this mall if you need to do some shopping - nothing really bad or good about that.  I'd honestly avoid this place if you're in a hurry though, especially if you want to eat at the food court."}
{"text":"I live in Scarborough so this is the mall that I grew up going to. Maybe I'm biased because of that, but I have no idea why people call it ghetto. Oh wait, I forgot...everything in Scarborough is ghetto, right? :p   That being said, maybe it wasn't always a great mall but recently/over the past few years, they've changed the mall a lot. It's gone through major renovations and tons of new stores have opened up that I would have normally had to go to a different mall to find...come September I won't even have to go to Fairview mall for a Forever 21, because it's opening in STC!  The store selection is great, I frequent the Coles, Walmart, H&M, Fairweather, and Bath and Body Works on every visit. The theatre is good. The food court has a wide selection. Like other reviewers said, the only problem is rowdy school kids, but if you go in the morning, or before 3, it's a great shopping experience. Nice and peaceful.   Another great thing about this mall is whats located around it. Awesome selection of restaurants and a huge Canadian Superstore.   Honestly, more often than not, I choose this mall over the Eaton Centre and Yorkdale, which are way too big for my tastes. I find everything I need here. In my opinion, this mall is very underrated."}
{"text":"They have much better stores than they did like 5-10 years ago! I'd say that this is a better place to shop than fairview :)"}
{"text":"I remember way back when STC was old and really sad looking. Now that they have put in some renovations, the whole place looks like a brand new mall and I was happy to see that it is bright and modern looking.  Being connected to the LRT and with plenty of parking space makes this a great shopping centre for residents in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Not the best location, not good if looking for children things or specifically infant clothing.  Would not recommen"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a mall person but I have to say the renovated Scarb Town Centre is much nicer. The food court is humongous. Lots of stores in this mall but I wish they had a Loft or Ann Taylor. That would make me like this mall more."}
{"text":"Nice mall with a great movie theatre located close to the 401. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"If you are from Scarborough, you know STC.   Back in the day, this place was a bit more old looking. Those who remember, they remember the balloons close to The Bay, $2 Cineplex Odeon when the Famous Players opened, and the arcade. During those times, the decor was not the greatest.   Now, they have done a number of renovations. The mall looks great and they are constantly improving (I do miss the balloons though). The crowds are very multicultural, and generally people are friendly.  There is a TTC location (RT) close by, and a Service Canada as well. Night time the Jack Astors across the street is the place and usually is packed. There is also a Moxies which is good.   Recommend going to this mall if you are int he area considering I have been to much much MUCH worse malls."}
{"text":"Big, spacious, busy mall. The food court is always busy with lots of selection to choose from. It also feels warm all the time, as if the air conditioning isn't working very well.  There are lots of stores to choose from including some nicer ones. Renovations and construction seem to be never ending. Every time I come here there's something being rebuilt it seems.  I like the movie theater here.  Parking can get confusing. The mall is conveniently accessible by TTC or Go."}
{"text":"Pretty generic mall in Scarborough. They've had many renovations over the years and right now they're revamping the downstairs food court but McDonald's is still open. The escalators from the main food court are blocked off, you'll have to go downstairs from the escalators/elevator near Victoria's Secret.   It's a bonus that just across the mall (in the same plaza), there are some restaurants, some shops,  and a Loblaws superstore. The mall is right off the 401 Brimley exit so it's pretty convenient. Parking is only difficult near Wal-Mart and the theatre, parking in the lower levels seem to be slightly better.   Came here mainly for Taco Bell and Jimmy the Greek since I wanted to try Taco Bell's new product, the stuft nacho! Big fan of Taco Bell but they've really been on the decline over the years and this new product was kind of a disappointment as well. I wasn't sure what I was eating and there's very little filling and most of it is just sour cream, liquid cheese, ground beef and i think either bacon bits or nacho crumbs. For $2.99, can't expect much but definitely not something I'd order again.   Jimmy the Greek's gyro dinner is generally pretty big in portion and is about $11. Tzatziki sauce is given separately in a small soy sauce container. Addition tzatziki sauce is 50 cents. Gyro was too salty though; I was very thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"Great assortment of store for everyone in the family, everything is well planned too bad there's always a bunch of gangster wannabe at the entrance of the mall (if you take the public transportation to go). Great place to hang out...love the stores!"}
{"text":"Scarborough town center is actually a nice mall, not bad at all! I never came here before, as i'm used to go to other malls in the area, but since i'm doing a new job near-by, i've been coming here alot, and I really like this place! it's always clean, nice and organized, plus it has alot of the good brand names..always busy, but you don't feel it crowded, very spacious and the sun-light comes in from everywhere.. I have alot yet to explore about this mall, in terms of dinning and other aspects, but as a mall, stores, etc..it's actually really good!"}
{"text":"It's a mall that I have been going to since I first existed in 1997. The mall has a lot of stores and free Wi-Fi. Some parts of the mall are dated such as Walmart, Sears, and the movie theatre, but it is a great place if you are looking for low to high end materials. The food court is the most exciting experience, Man Chu Wok is my favourite restaurant there and there is a KFC with a refill station. It's connected to transit, and regional services, and across the road to a Best Buy and a Loblaws Superstore."}
{"text":"Scarborough Town Centre is getting better and better every year.   A lot of renovations have been done to the Mall over the years. With that a lot of better shops too moved in: Lululemon, H & M, Victoria Secrets, DavidsTea, Indigo just to name a few.  Scarborough Town LTR stop, Close to Scarborough's Government Offices, right by McCowan/Brimely 401 exit/  And let's not forget all the new businesses that popping up around the Mall premises.  Scarborough Town Centre has everything you want, great Mall for the residents in the area!"}
{"text":"Let the ghetto jokes begin.  Scarborough Town Centre is your typical suburban mall, except it gets flack because it's located in that area of Toronto that everyone loves to pick on. The truth is, this mall is pretty decent. It's really picked itself up and has brought in some great stores - Sephora, H&M, Nine West, Lululemon, Aeropostale, a GIANT Loblaw Superstore, Best Buy etc. The mall itself is easy to handle -- not as huge as Yorkdale or the Eaton Centre, but with a lot of the same stores in a smaller space. It's totally accessible by TTC, has a huge parking lot, and even has a little \"village\" section across the street that is quickly expanding.  Not only that, STC has recently gotten a ton of restaurants in the area -- Boston Pizza, Canyon Creek Chophouse, Moxie's, Jack's Astor's, Milestone's, and the Canadian class, Swiss Chalet. And the theatre usually has a decent selection of movies -- not to mention that on Tuesdays, movies are only $4.99!  The problem with Scarborough Town Centre is that it is usually bombarded with rowdy teenagers -- but what mall isn't these days? If you want a peaceful shopping experience, come here in the morning during the week, it's absolutely heavenly. Overall, it's worth the trip to Scarborough, even if you have to take the stinky RT to get there."}
{"text":"This is my home away from home. As the years have gone by, I'm pretty sure I have the whole mall memorized. Many say that it's not as decent as other malls but it's got *almost* everything I need. They've got a huge Forever 21, H&M, Bath and Body Works, Sephora, The Body Shop, David's Tea, Starbucks, and Dollarama. All it's missing is the Lush they used to have and I'd be camping here. There's free Wifi and a food court on both the bottom and top floor with a nice variety. It may not be the swankiest mall with super posh stores, but it's still one of my favourites!"}
{"text":"I live around this area so I have been coming to STC for as long as I can remember. STC has been updating and renovating its look and atmosphere for the past couple of years and now it has additions like Artizia, David's Tea, Victoria's Secret and Brandy Melville. It has been expanding outside the mall as well with shops and restaurants, including the Canadian Superstore.   It does get overcrowded during peak times, and at these times I try to avoid STC as well. But during the weekday before 3pm it's quieter and less crowded with mall rats coming from school and blocking the escalators. The workers at the stores are generally nice and helpful.   STC is accessible by car, TTC and GO bus, the terminal is a main stop for transferring between services.   I will continue to come to STC, because it's the only decent shopping centre in Scarborough and you can find just about anything you're looking for here!"}
{"text":"One of my go to malls. They have renovated a lot since then and there are more stores to shop in. A great place if you want to go shopping,  eating or watching a movie"}
{"text":"Very busy place. Good selection of stores. Convienent department stores:  Walmart, Sears and The Bay. Many public transit options. Large food court with good selection. Entertainment bonus with a theatre. Good hours of operation, open everyday with long hours.  Good mall."}
{"text":"I'm really not understanding why STC is considered the \"ghetto\" mall. Yes, it's in Scarborough, but really... it's no different from any other suburban mall, aside from the RT station. There's really nothing so outstandingly good or bad that it sets Scarborough Town Centre apart from any other mall.  No matter what you need, chances are you can find it here. Pretty much all the popular clothing stores are here, including a relatively new Brandy Melville. The food court is good, but allow me to wish you luck in finding a seat. There are a few spas. There's a Walmart, The Bay, and Sears. This mall is also home to a Cineplex. I could continue, but I'll just repeat what I said before: Everything you need is here.  If you live in Scarborough, this is your mall. Chances are you come here a lot already. If you're not a Scarberian, though, there's really no sense in going out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"In contrast to other reviews, I really don't like this mall.  It feels claustrophobic and overcrowded.  You are forced to walk through the poorly designed food court and it is chaos.  Chaos can work; I love the energy that can come from being in huge crowds in New York, or Tokyo or Bangkok; in this food court however, it is a major headache and you are forced to endure it.    Beyond this criticism, the mall generally feels cramped, push and over populated.  I find the stores to be heavily picked over (especially around holidays) and generally happy to avoid being there if possible.  The only bright light I can give it is that the theaters are decent."}
{"text":"To be more specific, i will focus on the foodcourt of the mall.  To be even more specific, i love the wide selections of food stalls here, ranging from McDonald's to sushi to Chipotle!!!  Not many malls have this bragging right.   For this particular visit, i ordered shrimp tempura ramen from su&shi Noodle Bar.  There were 2 shrimp tempuras and two vegetable tempuras with the ramen.  This came to approximately  $12.  I think this is overpriced for a foodcourt eatery somehow, especially when the minimum wage is less than that per hour.  The plus side is that it was tasty.  The tempura  batter was light and wasn't oily. The foodcourt was packed!  I was there at around 330pm, and there were line ups everywhere.  I can only think of this as a good thing, which means food must be really delicious at the foodcourt.  I look forward to going back there to try other food!!!"}
{"text":"its being called a premium shopping mall? yeah ok! i'll give it to ya!  being the ninth largest mall in Canada is not something I would have guessed from looking and walking through this mall, I mean its big, but I didn't think it was big to that size! regardless, this location is fantastic since the renovations have been done, everything looks really good from a store perspective, and everything else. LOTS of parking at this mall, with some multi level options. very clean(renovated!) and some awesome transit options having a TTC:RT station on the mall property, but sadly not connected to the mall directly. something for everyone at this mall, which is really good! this mall also is super friendly in regards to getting on and off the highway, unlike the maze of Yorkdale, this mall is quick off and back on the highway! my only gripe is about the drivers in the parking lot, keep on you're toes and both eyes open! I've witnessed quite a few peoples vehicles get dinged, sadly."}
