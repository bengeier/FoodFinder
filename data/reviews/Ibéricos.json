{"text":"We had a great time on Friday night. Very good service and excellent food. I will definitely go back to try the paella on Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Great cold cuts, first time having this kind of dried meat (charcuterie?). Paella was nice. Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"A hidden gem: we went there on a Saturday night with a big group, and we had excellent and attentive service. This is authentic Spanish food - the real thing! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Super cadre sur la mythique rue saint Denis, carte vraiment orientée tapas/vin. Super service, la qualité était au rendez-vous, malheureusement l'addition monte vite et ce n'est pas 100% cohérent avec les proportions !"}
{"text":"I must have tried 6 things... literally all is good.  One of the nicest spots in MTL."}
{"text":"Le must du restaurant à tapas espagnols à Montreal! Un peu.... et vous pourriez croire que vous êtes sous la chaleur de Barcelone....en plein cur du plateau et à deux pas du métro Mont royal!  Vous adorerez le genre petite taverne de ce restaurant, avec une déco tout en pierres et une épicerie digne d'un compte de fées gastronomique! Tous les tapas et plats invitent à la gourmandise et à la délectation... Mais pour accéder à ce petit paradis, il vous faudra arriver assez tôt, ou réserver votre table mais également débourser une somme rondelette!  Mon coup de cur revient évidemment au jambon iberico....qui me donne juste envie de pleurer.... Apres je vous recommande également l'authentique tortilla espagnole, ainsi que les croquettes de jambon!  Enfin il serait un sacrilège de terminer cet enchantement des papilles sans goûter à leur Higos   con Mel i Mato, cad leur fromage doux, miel, figues, orange et pignons!  À tester sans modération si vous êtes à Montreal!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. We love hams, cheese with tomato bread. Cozy place with slow-paced. The flavor and service were great, especially the signature hams. A little salty, pricey and small portions."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not much seafood on the plates, salty also and the prices were high for what me and my friend got. Service was excellent tho."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices! We were looking for a place to eat some Spanish tapas, they have a great brunch deal and we ended up having great Spanish tortilla and patatas bravas with eggs, two plates with cheese, bread with tomato sauce and jamón ibérico. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal with my family of 4, and Ibericos was in our neighborhood. very friendly waiter (who I got to chat a bit on the soccer on the tv (Champions League)). back to the food. We had oxtails 2 ways, in fried croquettes and in canalones with a bechamel sauce. Tasty! Also the Spanish fries w/2 sauces (romesco and garlic mayo). Shrimp with garlic, Pork and squid meatballs (neglected to tell my sons that they had squid in them - hehehehehe, they enjoyed them nonetheless). And then we get to the ham. We got a mix of 4 different pork products, along with 2 different aged Manchego cheese plus a 3rd cheese. And some tomato bread. Grill some bread, then rub a half of a tomato on the bread, followed with a drizzle of very good Spanish olive oil. Kids loved this place."}
{"text":"A little bit of Spain in the middle of Montreal. This place has the best authentic food I've found in a while and the sangrias were to die for! Worth the hour drive for sure! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, cute and small restaurant, good ambiance. Tried the special menu at $41 with my friends and we all loved it. Must try if you're a fan of spanish tapas. Literally a minute walk from Mont-Royal metro station.   Special mention to the chocolat ganache coffee crumble... Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and decent selection for food. The paella was good and the octopus was one of the best I've had in the city. That said, we were a little forgotten after we ordered our aperitif. We needed to grab peoples attention to order our food and to get water. However, the food came out fast, no issues there."}
{"text":"A real gem!  My husband and I accidentally found this place upon a late night arrival from Halifax.  I highly suggest sitting at the bar to eat and if your lucky, Marie will be working.  Their octopus is far above anything I've had on the east coast. With only a few days in Montreal, and meeting up with my parents there, we chose to bring them back.  My husband is an executive chef and couldn't bare not to have a second meal there to further explore the menu.  Charming and sophisticated atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Excellent! Came for mtl a la table menu and everything was succulent! Especially the oxtail & mushroom croquette, fideua & carajillo! Everything was made with so much detail! Cant wait to come back and discover more of their amazing menu"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this spot by accident and it was the greatest thing that could've happened. The service was excellent & it was fun to have servers who spoke English, French, & Spanish.   The food was exquisite - from the croquetas, to patatas, charcuterie, & the churros & chocolate for dessert. It is an excellent spot for dinner for two or a small group (4-5 ppl). If you find yourself in Montreal definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent dîner chez Ibericos aujourd'hui!! Très bonne ambiance et service. Best paella ever!"}
{"text":"Authentic Spanish food, wonderful service. Everything we had was absolutely delicious, we'll come again!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this popular tapas bar.  Sangria was good but tapas awesome.  I would recommend the oxtail croquette and eggplant tapas.  Even if you don't like eggplant!  We sat outside which was pleasant as well."}
{"text":"We had our mother's day lunch here. The waiter was from Barcelona and the food seemed pretty authentic. We were four people and we shared everything. We had the Ibéricos charcuterie platter which consisted of Ibérico ham, chorizo, salchichón, and lomo. We also ordered an extra 30 g Ibérico ham because I love that stuff. The charcuterie was good but two of them tasted like salami to me and honestly I've had better cured ham at the resto Barocco. We also had the queso (cheese) platter which consisted of 6 month and 12 month cured manchego, Ibérico, and goat cheese. It was all very good. The charcuterie and cheese platters came with Pa Amb Tomàquet which is tomato bread with extra virgin olive oil on top. I don't like to carb up but it was so good that I had two. We shared the seafood and chicken paella for two people. It was big enough. It was very flavorful but a bit salty and oily for my liking. We also had the Pulpo a la Gallega  which is grilled octopus on a potato bed and sprinkled with paprika, olive oil, and Maldon salt. It was ok. I've had better grilled octopus. Sadly they ran out of the grilled calamari. The waiter recommended the Canelones de Rabo de Toro (braised oxtail cannelloni with béchamel sauce) because he said it was his favorite on the menu. It was my favorite thing on the menu too. The drinks were good. We had a pitcher of red sangria and I also got a glass of the white sangria."}
{"text":"Very authentic menu like I found in Catlan. Skip the cod croqueta didnt taste fresh though the beef and ham ones were very good. pan con tomate was very good but needed a bit more garlic.  Pulpo was very tender but the potato puree on the plate was unnecessary and took away from the pulpo."}
{"text":"The closest thing to Spaniard cuisine that I have found. I've been to Spain and have searched in many cities looking for authentic Spaniard food and have yet to find one until Ibéricos. I highly recommend this restaurant! Although parking is a nightmare, it's definitely worth it to try their prosciutto and cheese plate along with some sangria or an Estrella. Staff and environment are unmatched with an elegant downstairs that offers a welcoming feeling."}
{"text":"So you're in search of some good Spanish restaurant in Montreal?  Look no further!  Head on over to Ibéricos.  This cozy little neighborhood restaurant was conveniently located just a couple blocks from where we were staying.  I cannot take credit for discovering them.  My little sister and brother n'law found this gem.  Sorry, but I did not get the names of everything we ate.  What I can tell you is that all the Tapas dishes which they chose were delicious from start to finish.   I especially enjoyed the Cured Ham!!  It was melt in my mouth awesomeness!!  Ibéricos is an excellent choice when dining in this incredible city.  Make sure you save room for dessert."}
