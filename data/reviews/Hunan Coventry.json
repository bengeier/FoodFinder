{"text":"Decent food, nothing spectacular. Really cool place in Cleveland and nice staff. They'll cater to your needs with food, locally owned. 

A cool addition to the neighborhood though."}
{"text":"I am not a huge Chinese food fan but I like this place the best in Cleveland. I have gotten takeout and it is quick and cheap. Dining room never seems too busy. Nice portions, especially for the shrimp fried rice. The food is higher quality than most Chinese places."}
{"text":"This has some of the best Chinese food I have ever had, the quality has yet to be surpassed AND it is hot. More importantly, the customer service is great. A win-win as far as I am concerned"}
{"text":"am i halucinating?? seriously cannot believe that everyone hasn't rated hunan with 5 stars. i'm shocked. in my opinion: THE best chinese on earth. 

my boyfriend teases me that i only love hunan this much because as a little girl growing up in cleveland heights it was a family tradition to eat hunan on sunday nights. we had the phone number on speed dial (remember speed dial?!) and by about 8 years old, i knew the number by heart. so, my boyfriend thinks it's a sentimental thing. i think it's an amazing food thing. regardless, i crave hunan every sunday and wish they would deliver to chicago. 

best things on the menu:
- spring rolls (i could eat them all day every day - they are fresh made, light, crispy, and delish. and the homemade sweet&sour sauce/spicy mustard i could eat with a spoon)
- sesame chicken (can't get enough -- sauce served on the side so it's fresh and not soggy)
- szechwan green beans (my mom's favorite - perfectly spicy and surprisingly hearty for a veggie dish)
- kung pao chicken (if you like spicy, this is for you)
- general tso's chicken (not for dieters, but great for a splurge)
- SPRING ROLLS!!!!! can't say it enough.

ok. i'm drooling. gotta stop."}
{"text":"Consistently good for Chinese carryout. The food is not at all greasy (the usual curse of Chinese), fresh tasting, the beef dishes are tender, and even the sweet and sour shrimp is just right. I also appreciate that the food is always expertly packed in plastic containers, and always waiting on time. They also offer small and large sizes, which is perfect since normally the large is way too much for 2 people. Perfect for  Friday night easy meal at home!"}
{"text":"Since Marcelo introduced us to this place, we have been visiting Hunan every time we are in Cleveland (from 1987-2008). Best General-Tso's IMHO :-) . Menu is perfect with all the right dishes to please any picky/choosy member in the crowd. Service is excellent and very helpful. Complicated questions are answered by the knowledgeable staff - with a smile, and regulars may score samplings in small plate while waiting ;-)"}
{"text":"The best I can really say for this is that it did not make me sick. I love Chinese food, be it authentic Chinese food or greasy Americanized \"Chinese\" food but this meal failed to be an adequate representation of either. The chicken and broccoli just had an off flavor and the potstickers were rather hard and tasteless. I did like the dipping sauce that came with the potstickers. I had takeout so it is possible that this accounted for my disappointment. Unfortunately, I am not willing to risk another bad meal.
Service was polite and the dining room appears very pleasant. If the food quality isn't there, though, everything else is kind of irrelevant."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the food is pretty good.  Still looking for some great orange chicken but haven't found that restaurant yet in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered take out from here and the service has always been very prompt. They have always gotten my order right and the food is delicious! I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here after I dropped my sister off for college at Case and had a good meal.  Read \"good\" not \"great.\"  We got the potstickers as appetizers, which actually were the best part, I thought.  The rest of the the food was tasty but nothing any different from other Chinese establishments (though I may not be the best person to judge Chinese places, there are times when I am perfectly happy with Magic Wok).  The service was really good too.  If I am back the area and have a yearning for Chinese I will probably go back, but I am not sitting here today craving it again."}
{"text":"Ordered General Tso's chicken, fried rice, and veggie rolls. Tso's chicken tasted like orange chicken and wasn't all that spicy. Fried rice was bland and the egg rolls were okay. I probably will go back but only cause it's convenient."}
{"text":"No recommend this place at all. The waiter said nothing,  just pointed a table with his finger when we came in. When we asked him whether they had fish head which is the most famous Hunan dish, he told us he knew nothing about that. All the  waiters and waitress were very impolite. They didn't speak to us, even though we smiled and spoke Chinese to them."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing !!! Stopped by for a quick bite and was surprised how good the food really is here. For a soup and entree I ended up paying under 15 dollars and had some to take home for the next day."}
{"text":"Stupid, rude waitress. Didn't even understand what I said. It's okay if you didn't listen properly but shifting the blame to customers is just unacceptable. I don't care how old you are, but that's just poor customer service"}
{"text":"Jason is correct, this is the best Chinese food in Cleveland.  It is the Nicey-Nice Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.  The kind of place you take your favorite Oberlin professor to celebrate something cool happening  in one of our lives.  I also had many dates here that worked out well and they do pretty decent Hunan food for a city with not a huge Asian community.  You can probably do better in coastal cities but if you are jonesing for some decent Chinese food in the Plum City, you better head to Hunan Coventry."}
{"text":"Hands down the best General Tso's chicken I have ever eaten.  The honey lemon chicken is also incredible.  I've been here many times but never have I had the willpower to venture beyond those two powerhouse dishes.  I've had tastes of other people's platters, though, and they were also delicious.

Another plus: this is a really nice restaurant.  Not one of those this-chair-is-kinda-wobbly-and-this-silverware-looks-kinda-dirty Chinese places.  It's also reasonably priced and the portions are large.

One caveat: the amount of rice you get with your meal seems to be somewhat random but depends in part on how many people are at your table.  The more people you have, the less rice you tend to get per person.  Once we asked for a second serving of rice and got charged a ridiculous amount of money for it.  I don't remember how much it was, but I remember that it was enough that we asked the waiter about it when we got our check."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by stating that I have not been to this restaurant for a few years.  For about a year, I used to travel back and forth between Toronto and Cleveland Heights.  During that time - each and every time - I made sure that Hunan Coventry was the restaurant I had to revisit.  Why?  Overall, it is, quite simply, the best Chinese food restaurant that I have ever had the pleasure of dining at or getting take-out from.

About the food:  Perhaps my two favourite dishes for flavour are the Hunan shrimp (shrimp stir-fried with minced onion in a spicy tomato red chili sauce) and the Szechwan eggplant (stir-fried with water chestnuts and carrots in a spicy garlic sauce).  Having said that, others that I have tried and thoroughly enjoyed are the Szechwan string beans, vegetable fried rice, hot & sour soup, and wonton soup.  Furthermore, the amount of shrimp served with the \"shrimp with broccoli (Mandarin),\" has to be seen to be believed (in Toronto, you would certainly never ever get such portions, even in Chinatown).

As I said, I made it a point to eat at or at least get take-out from Hunan Coventry every time I visited the area.  If I ate in the restaurant, I found the servers to be attentive, but not obtrusive, and the restaurant and washrooms to be very clean.  Also, if I instead chose to have take-out, the young lady at the counter was always pleasant and organized, and my order was always fresh, hot, and accurate.

Furthermore, the owner at the time that I used to visit seemed to always be present and overlooking the establishment in order to make sure that certain standards were met, and that things ran smoothly and to the customer's satisfaction.  Having said that, I have since read that ownership has changed and standards have fallen (I don't know whether this is true or not; but, somehow I doubt it).  So, I cannot really comment on this as I will need to see if that is the case myself.  Certainly, I am more than willing to investigate the next time I am ever in the area.

On a side note: for those who are visiting Cleveland from out of town, Cleveland Heights is a region outside of the core, and is a very pleasant and relatively safe area with some grand houses and interesting brownstones.  Hunan Coventry is located in this area.

Coventry itself reminds me of The Annex in Toronto, as does Shaker Square (where there's a good repertoire theatre, not unlike The Bloor Cinema).  Meanwhile, University Circle makes for a pleasant stroll, and Little Italy has some wonderful eating establishments as well.

A good time to visit is during Cleveland's Feast of the Assumption, held each year in mid-August in the city's Little Italy neighborhood.  It's a four-day street fair that celebrates the Catholic Day of Assumption (August 15) with rides, great food (awesome Italian meatballs), live music, a procession, and it's lots of fun.

So, next time your in the area, make sure you go in August, see the celebration above, take in Case Western University's campus grounds and museums, check out The Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame, enjoy some of the residential architecture in the area, and be sure to dine at \"Hunan Coventry\" for some awesome Chinese food."}
{"text":"I am still trying to find a good Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.  Do they exist?  Just moved from DC a few years ago and I would only love to find that special \"hole in the wall\" here.  Hunan Coventry does not deliver good food.  Seems as if every time I go in there, it is empty too!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, and both times the food was so disgusting I couldn't stomach it and had to throw it away. Given some of the positive reviews on here I thought my first visit may have been a fluke, so I decided to give Hunan another try. Suffice it to say - I wish I had stayed away from it. Both times I ordered the General Tsos Chicken. The chicken was old and dry and tasted like mothballs dipped in sauce.  Similarly, the rice tasted like it was packaged in its container days ago. I hate wasting money, so you can rest assured I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just moved to Cleveland a couple months ago. I've been trying to find a good Chinese place and this is the best so far. We dined in. Staff was friendly and on top of their game. The restaurant was very clean and somewhat \"formal.\"  However, all the patrons were dressed very casually, so no need to get fancied up! The only thing that was weird is they give you cans when you order a pop. 

Location is great. We walked around and into some of the nearby shops after dinner. 

Parking could be a bit of a hassle as the restaurant is in one of the trendy areas of town. 

I will definitely return! Yay for finding \"my\" Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Most disappointing ever! I came and ordered over 30 mins and the waitress told me still not begin to cook. Worst service! Yelling the customer all the time. I will never come again as a real Chinese. Hunan Conventy is not Chinese food, it's the American Chinese food. If u want to have a great meal with friendly service, don't come!"}
{"text":"Just \"decent\" Chinese food.  I've definitely had better.  I have to agree with previous posters--the food is bland.  I didn't think it was possible to serve a bland soy sauce but somehow the sauce they serve with the potstickers was bland as hell.  I was disappointed that most of the chicken dishes were fried.  I was hoping to find more stir-fry.  On a positive note, the service was very good.  I think I'll try Mint Cafe next time."}
{"text":"Extremely bland food. The eggrolls were greasy and tasteless. The spare ribs were cold and flavorless. The sweet and sour chicken was of low quality meat and the eggplant was a mushy heap of goo on a plate. The waiter was very nice though so we felt bad and didn't want to say anything. Perhaps it was just what we ordered (though, it's quite a feat to make sweet and sour chicken that mediocre). We threw the left overs in the trash outside. I would pass if I were you as there are better restaurants on Coventry. Even Chinese takeout is better than this and cheaper to boot."}
{"text":"The first thing that struck me about this restaurants that it was packed full of caucasian people. The food was tasty and menu was very typical with nothing really genuinely Chinese. The staff was very nice and fast however and the place is very clean. Go here if you want a tasty typical American-Chinese meal, but if you want something more genuine, better stick to China street."}
{"text":"Intense and flavorful, the food at Hunan Coventry is everything you'd expect from a fine Chinese establishment in the metro-Cleveland area.  We showed up on a Saturday night around 6:30 with a party of seven + baby and were seated right away.  The wait staff was friendly and accommodating, and the food arrived at our table quickly.

We indulged in the following:

Mongolian beef
Home style bean curd
Shrimp fried rice
General Tso's Chicken
String beans and bean curd
Cashew shrimp

All were excellent, with the possible exception of the cashew shrimp, which was a little overwhelmed with water chestnuts.

Just one issue to report:  because the serving plates were square, it created a bit of a hazard as they whirled around the table on the lazy susan in the center.  There were two spillages, one of which resulted in Tsingtao in my niece's lap.  If you sit at one of the larger tables, I would recommend pulling all dishes away from the lazy susan, lest your relative suffer a similar fate."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my takeout order.  I had honey walnut chicken and Hunan beef and I didn't like either of them.  The chicken quality was really bad and the flavor on both dishes was pretty bland."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This used to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Cleveland area and was one of my favorite places to eat. Now the food is mediocre and the service subpar. I don't think I'll be back, and that saddens me greatly."}
{"text":"White tablecloth restaurant with good service, dining area very clean, Serving of Won Ton soup which I like is on the small side, Fried Rice is excellent as is the Mongolian Beef. Prices are a little high for the portions you get compared to other Chinese Restaurants."}
{"text":"Decent food with your typical veg options. 

The sesame noodles were a little too peanutty, but they were served hot, which was nice. I got the broccoli in garlic sauce and added some fried tofu, which was served as tiny, sad cubes.  The vegetable mu shu was ok.

The staff is very friendly, but the food is nothing to cheer about."}
{"text":"It has been two years since I was last at Hunan Coventry, the food was very good and I have yet to find its equal elsewhere in Clevleand.  

More importantly, Hunan Coventry helps to form what I have dubbed the Asian Triumvirate on Coventry.  Seriously, Hunan + Mint Cafe + Pacific East makes Coventry a great restaurant destination which this depressed economy really needs.  

Hopefully we will see a few more great restaurants open up in the empty spaces on Coventry."}
{"text":"This is probably the grossest Chinese food I've had in all of Cleveland (Trust me, I'm Chinese!). They use wayyyy too much oil. Just imagine a bunch of veggies/meat floating in oil--that's how ridiculous it is! Also, be warned that they put chest nuts in every dish. 

If you're looking for some good Chinese food, go to Asian town!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Hunan Coventry several times. It's one of the nicer Chinese places I've been too in Cleveland. The restaurant atmosphere is casual but classy and there is parking garage across the street. It's Coventry though so you're experience may very. 

I am a fan of the Cashew Chicken. I am not a fan of their Moo goo Gai pan.  I've always found their portions generous and their prices reasonable. 

I will go there there again the next time I come back into town."}
{"text":"Perfect for what it is. We were in the mood for quick Chinese and it did not disappoint! The sesame chicken, egg rolls and pan fried noodles were all delicious. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I've heard that this place might shut down in the near future (could just be a rumor...I hope not!) so I'm taking the time to give it a 5-star review in hopes that the universe rewards me and keeps it open as long as possible. 

I've never eaten in but get take out from here fairly often. The pot stickers are my favorite thing--a must-try. In contrast to the reviewer who said the pot stickers are doughy and barely fried, I'd call them thicker than some, but also incredibly delicious. My boyfriend and I both adore these pot stickers. 

Other favorites: sesame chicken (me) and empress chicken (him). The sesame chicken is unique because the sauce is on the side. Most dishes come in your choice or large or small portion size, except for the sesame chicken, which can only be a large. The large size is more than enough for two very hungry people, so you will have leftovers. 

Prices are good, service is good (for take out--have never eaten in), best Chinese food *I* have found in Cleveland*: I hope Hunan Coventry stays open!

*This is actually the only Chinese place in Cleveland out of the handful I have tried that hasn't disgusted me, and although I am open to other suggestions, I'm happy being a loyal customer of this Coventry neighborhood favorite for now.

Note: closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland, hands down.  It's been there forever, same waiters!, and consistent quality!   One of my favorites!  Get the wonton soup, the crab rangoon, and the paradise beef... You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Honestly!  Is it me? I don't think so.  Service nice, nice dining room, clean and friendly.  But the food? Oh my, not great.  We left most of it on our plates.  I think they think it's good.   Sesame chicken so tough I couldn't cut it,  dumplings very doughy.  Other dishes not up to par.   Won't return.  Say what u want about PF ,  but their sasame chicken is really good.  The one in Akron much better than Cleveland though."}
{"text":"I love the food here. We had a beef tenderloin dish and it was amazing. The spring rolls are delicious.  We've eaten here alot and have always been pleased."}
{"text":"This was my first Chinese food experience in the Cleveland area. My friend and I came here for a very late dinner, and I'm looking at this place favorably to begin with because they were very accommodating, despite us coming in at closing time. The space was large, and simple, well-kept. Good location, friendly service. The chicken lo mein I had was good, hit the spot, although it certainly was not the best I ever had. Reasonably good chinese food, although a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"This place used to be somewhere that I would eat every few months, but after my last visit I will never be coming back. I ordered the Home Style Bean Curd and about halfway through my meal I noticed something that looked like a bug on a piece of cabbage. Upon further inspection I discovered that it was a CENTIPEDE. I had never wished so badly that I had just found a hair in my food. I called the server over and he apologized and informed me that sometimes they have them in their cabbage and the kitchen must have missed this one. WHAT?!?! They removed the dish from the bill, but that was the extent of it. My date didn't finish his meal either because he was so horrified. Yuck."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Cleveland. Can you hear me? **THIS** **IS** **THE** **BEST** **CHINESE** **FOOD** **IN** **CLEVELAND**.  This place is an institution. If they ever close, I will kill myself. THIS IS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN CLEVELAND. Honey lemon chicken. Szechuan string beans. Moo shoo pork. Incredible pot stickers. Drool. When we lived in New York, every time we came back to Cleveland we would make a point to go here. This restaurant alone was a big reason I was happy to move back to Cleveland. Note: This is one place where a strange anomaly exists--the food may actually be *better* as take-out than when eating in. Chinese comfort food. THIS IS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN CLEVELAND!"}
{"text":"One of the best establishments on Coventry - We loved going here (twice a month or more), when we lived in Cleveland."}
{"text":"A disappointing meal here today.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, medium spicy.  It arrived not spicy at all, with about 3 peanuts, a handful of chicken and mostly water chesnuts.  What bothered me most was the quality of the chicken.  It did not seem fresh cooked and had a weird, spongy texture.  This place used to be great.  Not anymore."}
{"text":"Hunan has been around for many years and has even  survived fires back when it used to be up Coventry across from the Metropolitan bank. They have always had great food. If the owners changed, they must have kept the cooks because to me the food hasn't. Love the Hunan beef (the beef is very tender and marinated with pungent flavor) , Chicken lo mein, garlic chicken, and newly added Thai basil chicken. They will make the food spicy upon request."}
{"text":"There are a few times life that a meal is expertly planned....... I have dined here on a number of occasions. I did not find oily vegetables nor centipedes in my food. I walked in to a very nicely lit nicely set restaurant that had great service, a full bar, hot, fresh food served on beautiful China, soft music, great restaurant that was clean and rather reasonably priced. I don't need to come from China to tell you this. I suspect the food is not that authentic so don't fret- its a great place and a great place to take a date."}
{"text":"*UPDATE*

This used to be my favorite Chinese food of all time. Unfortunately the last time I had it it didn't taste anything like the Hunan I remember. The cashew chicken had a weird chemical like taste to it. The only decent thing was the fried rice and even that didn't taste the same.  I ended up getting a horrible migraine which I always get after eating Chinese food with a lot of MSG. I've never received migraines prior at Hunan but at my last visit I did. I have since then stayed away.  I would drive over 45 minutes to get their food because it was my favorite however now 45 minutes to get food and a migraine is just a bit extreme. If you have an MSG allergy you might want to stay away!"}
{"text":"I must of been to this place over 100 times in the 6yrs that I lived in Cleveland. The flavors are explosive, filling and psychologically addicting. I now live in Los Angeles CA and still think about Hunan on Coventry. The only thing to know about this place is that it is CLOSED on Mondays. At least when I was living there. I would look forward to a monday night at Hunan and would go into intermittent depression when I realized it was closed on mondays. Ugh. I miss this place, go there and indulge your senses."}
{"text":"OH HELLZ NO.  This is not good Chinese food in any respect.

Came here on a night that I didn't feel like driving out to Wonton Gourmet for chinese food and my go-to \"americanized greasy chinese\" place was closed.  My parents were visiting, so I stopped here given good reviews from a couple of friends.  

What.  the.  heck.  is.  this?  

Is this chinese?

American? Something else? Really? 

There was no flavor in any of the dishes I ordered.  Everything was bland, watery, and saturated with food coloring.  My parents were flabbergasted.  This is what Cleveland has to offer for chinese? I could see the wheels in my mother's head turning about how from now on she'd have to fedex me real chinese food from NY.   

I mean, this isn't even passable as bad chinese food.  This isn't even that delicious crappy soy-sauce drenched chinese food that you crave at 3am. 

Maybe that's why there were no other asian diners in the whole restaurant.  Apparently the rest of the asian population in Cleveland had already found out about this place. 

So the next day I took them to Wonton and Li Wah.  They felt better but my mother is still mailing me dumplings."}
{"text":"How unfortunate. 

I recently moved into the neighborhood and was pretty stoked that there were several food establishments on Coventry. A few weeks ago I had finished up at the gym that left me with a handsome appetite and ordered carry-out from Hunan Convetry - first and last time.  

I ordered crab rangoons, shrimp with honey walnut, Kung Pao beef, and pork chow fun ... (I was a little *hungry* :-P). It was a carry out order, and they were promptly ready for pick-up. I got back home super excited and immediately inhaled the rangoons; you can't really screw those up: it's fried wontons with cream cheese and sweet chili sauce. 

I don't think my palate is salt-biased, but this was the first time (in a long time) that I ADDED salt, among other things, to my shrimp and pork entrees. Chow fun ranks pretty high on my list of comfort foods - the broad doughy noodles full of flavor I expected were nothing more than tasteless oil-laden folds of pasta. I have my food issues, always cleaning my plate, always keeping leftovers, and never wasting (there are too many hungry people out there for me to be cavalier). Well, these two entrees ended up in the trash (did I mention I was STARVING when I ordered?). As for the beef, I tried my best to salvage my $$$ by re-purposing it the next day.

I would have done better picking up a frozen entree by Ina Garten or Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant near and dear to my past and (now) present. I would always come here as a kid for the proverbial Jewish Chinese food meal with my Dad's side of the family growing up.

This is not your standard hole in the wall junker Chinese food restaurant. I've actually found it particularly difficult to parse out decent Chinese cuisine in Cleveland personally. Sushi? Yes. Pho? Yes. Chinese food? No sir.

Anyhow, I ordered the Hunan Beef and my date ordered the Szechuan Beef. My dish was spicy and savory with the perfect water chestnut to peanut to sauce to beef ratio. Rice was on deck all day compliments of the friendly service. My date's Szechuan had some zing to it and delicious ripe green onions to pair with the delicious brown sauce.

To wash it down I went with the traditional hot tea I've always gotten. It had been 10 years since I'd stepped foot in here but the place is still the same go-to Chinese food.

I'd highly suggest this place if you're specifically looking for great Chinese. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Living about a half a block from Hunan Coventry is very, very lucky for me! I feel like this restaurant is great baseline by which to compare all other Chinese food. It's not the best ever, but it's really good. Portions are giant (the small orders usually still yield leftovers). Solid stand-by local restaurant. 

I highly reccomend the spring rolls. They're the best!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Cleveland my whole life and tried a lot of different Chinese restaurants. Hunan Coventry is the one I always come back to.  The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. Their spring rolls are light and delicious. My favorite thing to get is some hot & sour soup and kung pao chicken. Every dish I've tried though I've been happy with. My kids love coming even if we're doing carryout since the owner always gives them a lollipop which is super nice."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. My order was carry out and I ordered a spring roll and the chicken with cashews. The spring roll was good but the main dish was very very bland. I had to search for the cashews. There was also a lack of vegetables and I really disliked the texture of the chicken. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I ordered by phone, they said 30mn, i came after 45mn and nothing was ever prepared, they gave me the attitude and made me wait an extra 10mn, no discount or sorry for the extra delay. Food is good, service has been degrading over the years to the point that it might have been my last time there..."}
{"text":"Don't really like this place. I hear about it from people, it's always been there. I see people eating there, but I still don't really like this place.

The pot stickers were a weird consistency and the dish was kinda on the bland side. Personally if you're in the mood for something similar I would completely and highly recommend The Mint Cafe nearly directly across the street. Juss sayin."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese place in the known universe.  Well, at least my known universe, but maybe I am biased because  I grew up eating this stuff on at least a weekly basis.

The spring rolls and sesame chicken are easily the best I have had.  And I could eat the pot stickers till I fell over.  No other place serves up  a nice doughy pot sticker that is crispy on the outside with such a delicious special sauce. 

Their take out service is top notch.  I have easily ordered from this place 200 times and they have never gotten a thing wrong.  You never have to wait more than 25 min, and everything is always fresh.  Why does no other Chinese place serve the sauce on the side so that your fried chicken products don't get soggy on the ride home?

San Francisco has nothing that compares.  Maybe I should move back to Cleveland?"}
{"text":"When I live in Cleveland I went here everyday with my parents and had the cashew chicken and sweet and sour chicken and Beijing beef in white rice n sweet and sour sauce the best service in the best food around the only problem is you have to pay for each soda"}
{"text":"While I know Christmas night is crazy, I ordered our dinner at 4:30PM and was told it would absolutely be ready at 6:30PM. My boys were home from college and excited for a nice Chinese dinner. Well when I went to pick it up, I was told that our order was lost and our dinner could not be ready that night at all.  They never even tried to make it right for us. We used to be loyal customers, but I can honestly say we will never go back. That is not the way to run a business."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best Chinese food on this side of town! I can only speak for the vegetarian options. The veggie fried rice does have egg, though you can of course ask for it without like I did, still tastes great. Veggie lo mein is great, vegetable potstickers were great, a little flavorless, but they were satisfying. For $20, I got portions large enough for two or, if you're eating alone, enough for a large lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, roughly $6 a meal, so not bad! Service was quick and staff was friendly, not busy. Fresh veggies, everything was thoroughly cooked. Highly recommend this place and I've tried a lot of Chinese food on the east side."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this establishment for almost 15 years. I think I was Hunan's biggest fan, in fact. And that was for good reason. Their food had always been tasty, plentiful and consistent. The original owner (TC) sold it a few years ago to the head chef (or this is what I was told anyway). Since that time the quality of the food has declined steadily. Perhaps they are using inferior ingredients or just don't care but your dining experience will not be what it has been in the past. At my last visit (and that was literally my last visit) I had Cilantro chicken. It looked like no one took the time to chop the vegetables in an appetizing way. There were way too many cilantro stems and the chicken was chewy and fatty. I believable a piece of shrimp or scallop made its way into my dish as well. That was a surprise. My companion ordered chicken and vegetables and it was just flat out disgusting. This dish had NO flavor. I think chicken and vegetables cooked in water would have tasted better. Additionally, it had a different texture that didn't seem like chicken at all. The server was not accommodating and charged us for the bland dish even thought less than 5% had been consumed. I'm disappointed that the quality of the food has declined. I can no longer recommend this place and will not embarrass myself when dining with business associates."}
{"text":"Yup, not very authentic, just so-so food.  Not very impressed.  Some of my friends really like this place, but they are also the friends that rave about PF Changs.  So... I guess if you like Americanized Chinese food and don't dare venture out to the Asia Plaza area, it's the place for you."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Hunan has changed ownership! The food is very poor quality now and the service is just awful. No wonder the dining-in crowd has disappeared.  Every dish was salty to the point of being inedible. They definitely use MSG.  The servers are all rude, elderly ladies.

But here was the most telling indication that we should never return: the moo shu which comes with Chinese pancakes?  They serve it with  Mexican tortillas - cold!  A total joke. I don't want to think about what other corners they might be cutting in their \"cuisine.\"  You would think that they were *trying* to lose customers with this crap. 

It's a real shame because Hunan ran a great establishment for decades.  I hope the current owners go under and have to pass the reigns to someone - anyone - better."}
{"text":"Ordered won-ton soup, postickers, empress chicken and Kung-po chicken with white rice.
The order-taker on the phone was abrupt.
Still, I dared to order!
This was, bar-none, the *worst* Chinese food I have ever had from this place, to date.  Everything from the soup (no scallions, very little noodles) to the main dishes (soggy empress chicken, flavorless and un-spicy Kung-po chicken) was a disappointment.  The pot stickers looked steamed, which is fine; except they were fried (barely).  They were mooshy and doughy with very little filling.
This place has gone down-hill.  It used to be the best place for Kung-po.  
The only thing that wasn't a disappointment was the steamed rice.  Go to Li-Wah."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the BEST Chinese food in Cleveland. Huge portions, great prices, and excellent staff. I've never ordered anything here that wasn't completely delicious. The lo mein is awesome for dinner and even better the next morning for breakfast. We always leave stuffed and with a doggie bag for the next day. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I was so disappointed by a meal. Both dishes came to the table an unappealing brown color, with nary a fresh vegetable to be seen. 

This was definitely our only visit here."}
{"text":"The decor and vibe were very relaxed and authentic. The food too was quite good. I've been in Cleveland for over 6 months now and I think this is the best Chinese place I've tried here. We ordered the chicken Lo Mein and sweet and sour chicken, both of which were tasty. The tea also got a thumbs up.

A star off because the menu was a bit confusing and the waiter had to go around explaining it to everyone. (Which could be good because they made sure you didn't end up with something you didn't want.)"}
{"text":"As a family we have supported this restaurant for many years, now that the kids are gone we moved on to carryout. One order has been worse than the next. The beloved gyoza...burnt, half the pork in the fried rice was burnt. Another carryout yielded flat and greasy egg fu young and the cashew chicken was stringy, the cashews sparse and the sauce tasteless. A third carryout yielded great spring rolls and crab rangoon and burnt asparagus in chicken/shrimp asparagus. We have decided to move on, there are other great choices not only on coventry, but taylor and other surrounding neighborhoods. Too bad really, we love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Hunan Coventry since about 2001.  What a shock how bad this restaurant has become! Horrible atmosphere, wait staff, and food. So sad, it used to be wonderful and classy.  What a sh#t hole in every way"}
{"text":"I frequent this location on an almost weekly basis for carryout.  The food is always ready quickly, and the order is always accurate.  Not to mention, it is incredibly inexpensive.

Also, they have brown rice, so if this is your thing, be sure to ask.  They don't always offer."}
{"text":"Generous portions, excellent flavor, friendly and attentive service. Decor screams 1930's, but the place is clean and spacious. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have always enjoyed the experience. The service is pretty good--the servers are quick! Overall very good quality food and large portion sizes."}
{"text":"Meh.  Just, meh. 

I have this theory about Chinese food.  In the 1940's and 50's, leaders in the Chinese community trained immigrants to cook Americanized Chinese: few flavored beyond salty and sweet.  Few vegetables. Little color.  As our tastes became more sophisticated, thanks to Indian, Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese, old school Chinese restaurants became Mire old school. They just added fat, salt and sugar.  

Now, it's just sad. 

I'd love to find a Chinese restaurant that serves fresh, healthy, simple but flavorful food closer to what is eaten in China.  

This isn't it.  This would be at home in 1952.  Serviceable but not exciting."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland IMO. The food has great flavor as well as the soups and appetizers. Won Ton soup is always a solid choice. Give the Cashew Chicken a try. But you don't have to take my word for it. Do yourself a favor and go give it a try."}
{"text":"I went there to celebrate my birthday and the food was tasted worse than some dishes that sold in Cleveland's Chinese grocery stores. I would not go there anymore."}
{"text":"Hunan Coventry is a decent if unspectacular Chinese restaurant.

The prices are pretty average, and the portions are quite big... big enough for 2 meals.  $10-12 for 2 meals isn't too bad.  I had the shrimp fried noodles, which was decent but a bit oily for my taste.  I would hate to know the caloric content of that mountain of noodles, oil, and shrimp.  It is probably best not to know.

The sesame chicken sauce is very very odd if you are used to the typical sesame chicken that every Chinese place has.  It is sweet and thick and tastes very much like ketchup.  I can't decide if it is good or not... but it is definitely odd.  Otherwise the service was ok if a bit cold and businesslike.  I can't really complain... there is a difference between not friendly and unfriendly.

The Coventry parking garage is pretty much right across the street, which makes access to this place relatively convenient.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it can definitely satisfy a craving for those living around Coventry.  The place was also very empty on a weekend evening... so no waiting."}
