{"text":"Nice place in the heart of Wesmount.   I went with a fairly large group (9 people). We were shown to a  large table in an interesting \"sunken\" portion of the restaurant. All the furniture appears brand new and is very modern. I thought the flat screen TV showing a 15 minute loop of Italian tourism video was kind of tacky but whatever.  I was happy with everything I ate. The best thing I had all night were these little meatballs that were served as sort of a pre-appetizer with some really excellent bread. I immediately checked the menu to see if a meatball dish was offered but was disappointed to find there wasn't one.  I ordered the Table d'hôte and chose the spicy mussels appetizer, a pasta dish with sausage (the name of which escapes me) and a brownie dessert. Again, everything I ate was great and the four stars above are based on my own experience.  Several people in our party ordered a veal dish that somehow involved Baily's liquor. Everyone thought that the veal would have some kind of a sauce on it that had a touch of Baily's in it. It ended up being some very nicely prepared veal with straight Bailey's poured on top of it. Four of the nine people at our table ordered this dish and all described it as disgusting.   Now, after half of our group received meals that they described as barely edible, we all left saying we would definitely be back. How? Excellent customer service. The waiter immediately offered to replace the meals of those that were not happy. Nobody took him up on the offer but the offer was much appreciated. At the end of the meal we were all given a free glass of port as an apology and in the hope we would all come back again. Thats how it's done!   I'm going to ascribe the weird Baily's and Veal dish as a chef pushing the envelope a little too far. I would be very surprised to see it on the menu next time I am there.  My wife and I both ordered from the Table d'hôte and had no wine or alcohol. Our bill was $55.00 + tip. This was extremely reasonable considering the atmosphere, quality of service and food served at this restaurant. The regular menu had appetizers between $12.00 and $16.00 and entree's ranging from $23.00 to $35.00.  This place took care of our large group but would also be a good place for a date. The interior is hip and modern and quiet enough to hold a conversation across the table.  We will definitely be going back."}

{"text":"This is a place with FANTASTIC professional service and good quality ingredients.  The first time I went I had the table d'hote lunch menu and had an enjoyable eggplant pasta with a soup and dessert and coffee for $10.  The service and quality and value was brilliant.  Went for dinner and chose to get the linguini with clams (see photo). Sadly it was dry and salty and there was a lot of sand in it.  Pretty gross.  The person who had the risotto really enjoyed it - it was the best I had tried lately at any restaurant.  we also got an appy of prosciutto, figs, and parmesan. It was very generous and the quality was good so thats a nice thing to share for the table.  They serve good quality bread piping hot with oil and vinegar.   I would say go for a lunch sometime- you won't get a better deal in westmount.  However, play it safe."}
