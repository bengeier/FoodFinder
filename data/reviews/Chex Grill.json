{"text":"Love love love this place. Ordered every sandwich on the menu for the office using my restaurant app a few months ago and no single complaint was made. However I go at least once a week now to get the wings...spicy garlic topped with lemon pepper. Best wings in town. Not to mention awesome staff...always pleasant, quick, and going beyond. Earlier this week they stayed 45 mins later just so I could get wings once I got off! Great prices even better food."}
{"text":"I've been having a great taste for some awesome wings, knowing that TLC wings from the Pineville area was now involved I decided to give them a try, I got them for the panthers vs Seahawks game and they was great, well today I wanted to have them for lunch and what a waste, my wife went and brought me a 10 piece with fries, they was suppose to be Hot & extra crispy, not only was they the wrong flavor which I don't eat, I was pissed, they gave her bar-b-q wings, she took them back, they apologized she states that with the same minute they came back with some more wings which now was the Flavor of \"Hot\" she brings the wings back to me and what I experienced was a mess, cold wings, because they only re-tossed the old wings in hot sauce, but still had the buffalo flavor under them, not a good look, I'll never spend my hard earned money @ this place again, NOT TLC management if you ask me, I've been going to TLC since early 2000, it has changed owners over the years but if Chex Grill is associated with them I sure can't tell....."}
{"text":"Chex Grill is absolutely the best place to get Philly cheese steaks sandwiches in Charlotte. My girlfriend and I loved the mushrooms and sauce--there was just the right amount on the sandwich to prevent the bread from becoming soggy.
We ordered the fries with the sandwich, and they were fantastic as well. They were crispy on the outside and seasoned with a good flavor (they also weren't soggy too oily, which was nice).

Conclusion: this is definitely that we will return to within a week!"}
{"text":"LOVE. Just tried Chez for the first time a few weeks ago and fell in love. The staff is very friendly let us try the different sauces and even made us shrimp in our favorite sauce free of charge. The place was very clean and overly just a very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Apparently the current ownership is not the best at keeping things clean. The current health grade posted is 92.5. All of the dining tables needed to be cleaned and all of the chairs could use a good cleaning too. Ordered two Greek salads with grilled chicken and received two Caesar salads with grilled chicken. The kitchen had to make both salads over again. Can't say I'm a big fan of their Greek dressing. It was something from a bottle. The drink machine had no ice in it and they had to put ice in cups manually from behind the counter. The other person in our group ordered a crispy chicken sandwich. The crispy chicken sandwich came out far too greasy. Even the crispy chicken at Wendy's is better. The grilled chicken in the salads however was pretty good. The biggest distraction while eating here was the very loud music coming from the kitchen. It was even louder than the TV. I do not plan on eating here again until I find out they have done a major deep cleaning of the entire establishment."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the same owners as TLC, but they don't have pizza as of yet (hopefully that changes). I always get the sparky delight wings sprinkled with additional lemon pepper and Georgia red. I've tried a few flavors which were all good, but sparky delight is the best! The customer service is always good. Oh yeah, there's never an unbearable wait."}
{"text":"I drive pass this place all the time. A friend and I decided to try their wings. I got the lemon pepper and calsyco flavor wings. The lemon pepper taste like regular fried wings and the calsyco tasted like a sweet BBQ. I will not be getting them again. My friend got the buffalo and Parmesan flavor. Both of them were very good. I'll be back for those. The fries don't look like the pictures posted. The are thin and salty. I didn't like them. They have alot of wing favors that I want to try and their sandwich selection seemed to have variety so I will be back. I give them a strong 3.8."}
{"text":"Had the cheesesteak and fries. It was really good, probably my second favorite in Charlotte.  Fries are great. Only complaint is they didn't have unsweet tea,  only sweet. Friendly staff, place was pretty clean,  especially for Freedom Dr.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food, really good customer service,  we had a little wait for our order and they brought us complimentary wings while we waited. This customer service is not see often in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I been to this place more then 10 times they got the best of the best wings and subs I have ever had I'm from Brooklyn NY and when I say they got the best of all the best subs and wings I mean it there service is amazing and friendly and they are quick on making the orders and they make it all fresh to order omg omg there fries and dipping sauce is just so delicious that makes me come back three to four times a week I really want to take the time and appreciate it all the staff and the team leaders and the owner for this amazing place and best food and delicious tasty food...."}
{"text":"The chicken philly topped with blue cheese is bomb. They also have great wings and I always get my wings crispy for that added crunch."}
{"text":"I like chex the service is pretty quick I've had their wings I really enjoy their steak and cheese the food is fresh and made-to-order I'd recommend it"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and had the Philly chicken cheese and was great! You can upgrade to a combo with fries and a drink for $1.99 more so the average is about $8. The fries are breaded which I don't prefer but still very good. All food is cooked fresh to order so nothing soggy. A friend had the hot oven club which she enjoyed as well. 

They definitely pack the subs with plenty of meat so you won't feel jipped like other places. Will return in the future."}
{"text":"The wings are amazing!  So many sauce options to choose from.  The owner was so kind and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on my dinner break after reading tons of good reviews. Had to get me a \"philly\" cheesesteak and it was huge! I ordered it with fries but was shocked to find out the fries were the highlight of my meal. Loaded with cheese and meat I thought my sandwich would be been epic but it somehow wasn't.

There was a surprising lack of taste and I was a little turned off by the fact I couldn't even attempt to pick it up with my hands. I had to pull pieces apart and eat it that way. It wasn't bad by any means but I feel it just didn't live up to the expectations I read about."}
{"text":"Only Yelp could lead me to a Philly cheesesteak at a strip mall gem on Freedom Drive. A little hole in the wall where you can not only get a sandwich, but also walk through a door and get your taxes done as well.

Nothing fancy, just a no frills joint serving up phillys, subs, salads, and wings (with more than 30 flavors). Any place that does fried pickles with spears instead of chops is a big winner in my book. Not only that, they come eight to an order and are huge. I did a Philly as well. I'd definitely come back and get that again, although I saw a pic of the burger after I ordered and may need that in my life as well.

Bonus: save time and place your order online for pickup. Dear  restaurants, why don't you all do this?"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  I haven't had anything there that was not Delicious!  The guys are friendly and take care of me everytime I'm there.  Gone 3 times in the last 3 weeks, I've had wings, grill chicken pita and philly cheese steak.  The portion sizes are not small my any means"}
{"text":"I used to go here lots and get the grilled chicken house salad. OH MY! the cook is amazing. Than new owners came in, they bought the place from the guy who owns the gas station right next to them--BIG BIG mistake. Everyone is  a cook, counter wait is crazy and so is the wait for simple items. Ugh! My go to place :( 
I will give them some more time ad go back and see whats what!"}
{"text":"Good this is the 2nd location for TLC wings from Pineville Matthews Rd.

Wings and Philly cheese steak is awesome. I love the spicy garlic Parmesan wings. I think they make there own sause"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches!! Italian sub and Philly cheesesteak are awesome!!  Super nice staff."}
{"text":"Love this place will always go there.. if you want awesome wings this is your spot and for sandwiches as well"}
{"text":"Finally good chicken wings on West side! And hot subs are awesome! Will be coming here a lot!"}
{"text":"I'm always up for a questionable looking place that can deliver \"diamond in the rough\" level food - and Chex fits this bill nicely.  It's tucked off the main street in a smaller strip-mall kinda set up, so it's honestly not very easy to find if you're not looking for it.

The interior of the restaurant is sub-optimal if I'm being honest.  It shares a door with a tax place, so common traffic uses both doors, people get confused, it's a little amateurish.  The dining area is also pretty rudimentary with stackable chairs and pretty bare-bones tables.  Posters on the wall, primary colored paint on the walls, its not a place you should bring that chick from Marketing you're hoping to score with.

In fact, the decor itself signals that this place should be considered more of a take-out place, and that's exactly what they're trying to accomplish.  The best part about it is the food!  Had a delicious philly cheesteak and double fried fries.  Decent portion size, decent price, great value!

I'd recommend swinging by this place to pick up a lunch on the go - it's a winner!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today at lunch and absolutely loved it. The service was great, everyone working there was so nice and hard working. The gentleman that took our order asked if it was our first time, then offered us fries and drink on the house, then brought wings for us to try and they were banging. We got the Philly cheesesteak and jerk chicken sub, both were amazing. The Philly was one of the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I got a Chicken Cheesesteak and French fries and that is hands down the best cheesesteak I've had since I moved to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing! The guys cooking to the guys in the front when you come in. Everything about this place is great from professional owner Khaled who I had a pleasure to meet and the crew. Also the Manager Danny was beyond exellent! From the time I walked in to the time I walked out. One of the best choices in food! A great place honestly you must eat here!"}
