{"text":"Stopped by for a coffee, what a lovely little place!  Pleasant environment and staff, and delicious drinks.  We had a cappuccino and a smoothie, both were excellent. And price was reasonable."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here since I've found this place by chance while shopping on Chinatown. It was such a tasteful experience! I even brought my family there when they visited us from Brazil. The crepes are soooo delicious, well filled and nicely presented! I also love the Italian soda and Milk Tea."}
{"text":"This is an amazing crepe and coffee as well.
Good service and nice people.
Thank u for a good experience"}
{"text":"I work three blocks away from this spot :). Drop in a few times, for take out.  I love their meat crepes, and that sweet crepe with gelato!  Delicious!   The girl who worked there offered me a glass of water while I was waiting.  (I give 5star for her service :D) 

It usually took about 7 minutes for two crepes, which I don't mind to wait, coz they make crepes by order.  The price is good too, compare with others.  

I also like the Jazz they are playing

I think they also offer free wifi."}
{"text":"Its my third time, the owners are sweet, great atmosphere with ambient music, delicious crepes and gelato and it comes with a beautiful presentation and generously filled !"}
{"text":"Quite a pleasant tea shop situated in the middle of China Town. The staff were very friendly, and accomodating, music was relaxing, and best of all, the tea was delicious! Didn't try the crepes, but definitely would try them next time!"}
{"text":"great service and environment. I tried strawberry  crepe with gelato and tea. both are good though price is a bit high. would come again to try the meat one."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes. Had a Strawberry Nutella crepe and i couldn't stop .. Also ordered a mango smoothie - real mangos with a bit of ice, pretty good too. Great wifi. Very nice staff, with a typical Taiwan warmth. Will be back."}
{"text":"I visited Spot Crepes & Tea again and this time, I tried their Strawberry Jasmine Tea and Honeydew Smoothie. Both were excellent! 

The jasmine tea used real strawberry juice (not artificial syrup), giving it a truly authentic, fruity taste that wasn't too sugary.

The honeydew smoothie was also excellent, with a light, refreshing flavour. 

The spicy chicken crepe is always a great choice. It's stuffed with a ton of filling and the sauce they use is so tasty. It's not TOO spicy but it does have a bit of a kick. 

The breakfast combo (2 eggs, bacon, and plain crepes) was, as always, fantastic and perfect for a light meal."}
{"text":"We walked into this place by accident and we are so lucky we did! The owners are extremely polite making you feel welcomed and comfortable very fast. In the middle of a very busy street you can find a quaint space with good food and a great relaxing atmosphere. A must go to for sure! My husband tried the gelato and finished it in a blink of an eye.

We will surely come for round 2...but this time for a nutella strawberry crepe."}
{"text":"Beautiful crepes! The tea was delicious with a great selection. Really clean and bright place with wifi. The staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is incredible."}
{"text":"I tried Strawberry Banana Nutella ($6.99) and Banana Chocolate ($5.99) on a Saturday night.

Environment: (5/5)
Very spacious and slow-paced with relaxing music. 

Service: (3.5/5)
- Friendly: One of the waitresses welcomed us politely and we followed her to a table. She brought the set of menu to us, too. Also, they offered us cold water since the crepes are sweet.
- Too slow: We actually waited for quite long for two crepes. They made the crepe carefully that I know they lined the fruits up in the crepe beautifully. Also, there were take-out orders and other customers' orders while there were only two staff making crepes. Undoubtedly, the wait time should be long.

Food: (4/5)
- Relatively thick: It depends on what texture of crepe you prefer. Their crepe is Japanese style that it is thicker than those crispy French crepe. If you want to compare to the other crepe store Millie Crepe, theirs is thicker than Millie Crepe's. On the other hand, the texture of their crepe is a little bit too rich or too much; it might be harder for you to bite off. That's why they lost one star. But it's actually just some imperfections of a near perfect crepe!
- Fruitful: if you would like to compare theirs with Millie crepe, in terms of ingredient portion they have more fruits inside one crepe than the mentioned store. But that only applies to what I ate and when i ate :) also note that they do not have icecream for the banana crepe and strawberry banana nutella.
- Looks good: with reference to my photos, you would realized that they decorated the crepe with fruits and chocolate sauce.

Price: (4/5)
It's relatively expensive if comparing to crepe stores. Their crepe prices range from $4.49 to $9.99. Though I only tried their $5.99 and $6.99 crepes, but I will definitely come back again and at least try their Chef Recommended!"}
{"text":"Loved their Buckingham Palace tea, and it was served in the cutest chinaware. The ni√ßoise crepe was just alright; their red bean crepe was pretty novel and a satisfying dessert.

Cute place to stop by on an afternoon."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it was quick. The crepes taste great, especially the meat deluxe. It uses Japanese mayo which makes it taste a bit different than other western crepe places. The other crepes taste great too but this was our favorite. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OMG - we just happened to walk by and were tempted by the crepe photos and the wheel in the window.  Wow, was the crepe we got DELICIOUS - nutella and berries and whipped cream!!!  (and as someone before mentioned, very reasonably priced)"}
{"text":"Thick is in ;)

Spot's fillings are generous and the combinations are delicious. And the pricing? Woohoo! Get in on this deal, Yelp. I had the Meat Deluxe as well as the Very Berry Deluxe crepes and both were 5/5-would-eat-again. 

Oh, and definitely try the tiramisu gelato. It is fabulous."}
{"text":"I went inside on a whim and ordered the veggie lovers and the strawberry crepe! The ingredients used were incredibly fresh and I loved the simplistic and cute interior"}
{"text":"Tasty crepes! The crepes were of fair size. I ordered the very berry crepe and split it between my girlfriend's and I. It was the perfect finish after dinner.

Matcha latte has a lot of matcha.

I'd love to go back in the summer to try other gelato flavours."}
{"text":"I'm a huge crepe fan and this is my go to place now. I found it accidently when I was walking by it one day. It turns out it was their first day opening. To be honest I wasn't expecting much at first, I was thinking it might be more like a bbt place with mediocre desserts, but boy was I glad I was wrong (there are no bbt drinks in the menu right now, but they do have a good variety of caffeine drinks, smoothies and teas. They did say to me last time that when their spring/summer menu comes out they will add bbt). They also have free wifi :)

First impressions: place was clean, tidy, and bright. You don't always get that when you go to resturants in Chinatown. Decor was simplistic like a casual cafe you can go to to do some work or relax. Staff was very friendly, all smiles and greeted you as you came in. It felt like a family owned shop type of feel and I really like that. You also see the crepe making area as soon as you get in, like most crepe places, the work area looked cleaned which is always good. They also have their gelatos lined for you to see as soon as you walked in which made me more excited to try out their gelatos. They have around 5 or 6 gelatos flavors to choose from and some ice cream.

Price: pretty decent for crepes. They range from 7$ to 9$ before tax depending on what you get. They also serve hot drinks and teas, I thought the price was decent and fair. Drinks typically 3-7$ range, again depends on what you get. You can also buy gelato by the scoop without the crepes for 4$.

Service: very friendly and approachable, open to suggestions (they asked how the crepes were - we had ordered one meat lover crepe and a gelato party crepe. The meat lover crepe had too much mayo on it, we let her know to put less next time and she was very receptive to that suggestion saying they just opened and don't mind any feedback we had. The next time we came in we ordered the same and they had changed how much mayo they now put on it. I have since order the same crepe a few times and have no complaints. I like how when you order tea they use nice tea cups and their tea lists shows how much caffeine and antioxidants each tea has (I.e., low, moderate etc.) 

Taste: I gotta say I am a big fan of their crepes, it's definitely on the thicker side which I like compared to other crepes. My fave is the gelato party, it has fruits, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and your choice of a scoop of their gelato. It's a good portion size that definitely satisfies my sweet tooth!

Overall I'm really enjoying this place and what it has to offer. It's perfect for a cute date or to go to do some work, (it has jazz music in the background that's provides a relaxing ambiance, sometimes I don't even notice the music playing which is what I prefer). I think it will fill a need in the area since there's not too many dessert places in this location!"}
{"text":"A nice after dinner spot!

Cute ambiance. Bright, modern, and clean. Nice soothing jazz music playing in the background.

They have a wide selection of teas. They give you a clipboard of teas, caffeine level, and antioxidants. I got the monk tea and enjoyed the vanilla flavour. 

We ordered a sausage crepe that came with salad and pickles. The crepe was soft and chewy. The sausage was pretty salty so the crepe balanced it out. The sausage tasted like a Costco Kirkland brand sausage. Worth the $7!

We also ordered a strawberry Nutella crepe with Tiramisu gelato I didn't like the gelato because had too much of an alcoholic taste. The crepe itself was delicious. Soft and chewy. Strawberries were sweet! Loved the crepe here! $10 for both.

They have free wifi, but it didn't work for me. Maybe the server was down.

Prices are totally reasonable. We paid $25 for everything including tax and tips. Definitely a cozy place for an after dinner light cap!"}
{"text":"$7.90 Gelato smoothie is NOT A SMOOTHIE

is a milk mixed with melted gelato. Juice-consistency

super aggressive staff who cannot speak english.

Ruined my whole night, thank you!"}
{"text":"Hate the people, hate the service, hate the drink.
Asked for an Iced Mocha, but the server said they cannot make it \"iced\" without an explanation and PUSHED me to order an iced cappuccino. I said no, I want to change it to an Iced Cafe Latte. She said sure, but then comes back saying they cannot make it \"iced\" and PUSHED me again to order an iced cappuccino.

I rarely order a cappuccino but was \"convinced\" they can make a delicious cappuccino. At that point, I caved in because the 2 women were selling me the iced cappuccino SO HARD, only to be SO disappointed. I offered the drink back to them because I no longer wanted it--I was expecting ice cubes but received an ice-blended cappuccino and it tasted awful. They were so bitchy and asked me if I knew what an espresso is. I obviously said yes, a fucking Mocha and Cafe Latte has espresso in it too. NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"a nice quaint place I've never really noticed before. it was quite sad how empty this place was as their food and pretty amazing. we got the berry crepes which were just so good and we also got the dark roasted oolong tea. overall, the food quality here is just amazing and service was pretty good. would come back!"}
{"text":"After dinner, friends and I just wanted somewhere to sit down and relax and to our surprise, we found this nice small place on Spadina towards College. 

Review: 3.5/5
Ordered:
1) Waffle w/strawberry and cookies and creme ice cream
- They have about 6 flavours if I'm not mistakened (Strawberry, Cookies and Creme - only ones i remembered)
- waffle was fresh and ice cream was ok
2) Blueberry tea? 
- This was ok, perhaps I ordered the wrong tea?

Helpful tips:
Address: 
-385 Spadina Avenue (closer to College and Spadina)
- Seating: seats less than 30 I believe
- Environment: nice, quiet, casual environment to just hang out/have a conversation with a few friends
- Wifi: Yes!"}
{"text":"I've dropped by a few times just to make sure it wasn't a fluke.  After enjoying a coffee and a couple of their teas (some to stay, some to go), I took the plunge and tried their mixed berry crepes.

Delicious.  I got an order to take home, which was much enjoyed.

The atmosphere is very nice.  Quiet jazz.  Comfortable chairs and solid tables, which is a must for me.  It is a perfect place to sit pleasantly with a friend or by yourself.  The staff don't hover or ignore you.

Will be back, to try another tea - and another crepe!"}
{"text":"Natural fruits smoothies , very tasty desserts , service A+! Came from Miami and fall in love with this place !"}
{"text":"We stopped in last week for a crepe, and this place is really lovely.  The young ladies who work there are very kind, the crepes and gelato were delish, and the peach smoothie was by far the best smoothie I've ever tasted.  We had to go back before leaving town to get another.  Great little spot - highly recommended"}
