{"text":"Looking around town for Jin's chicken and fish which wasn't in its normal Francis location we found this spot. Fulfilling after bar chicken/fish sandwiches. Would never go here for a meal but it's a perfect after bar spot. I got a chicken sandwich which was basically two chicken fingers drenched in Franks Red Hot, mayo, tiny lettuce piece on a thin hamburger bun. Did the trick for what I wanted."}
{"text":"Was excited to try jd's after reading the reviews.   Walked in to see 4 tables and a menu board that had more items taped over than those available.  

 Standing at the counter and attempting to give an order and we were told after every request \"we are out of that\" and learned that they pretty much only have wings and fries,  and it will at least 20 minutes for the wings. 

They should be getting their delivery in a couple days,  so try them on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight. A friend and I happened to be walking past and decided to stop in. The food was pretty good. I had the steak burger with mashed potatoes. Banana pudding was my dessert choice. Pretty big menu to choose from also, and the portions here are pretty generous.

Walking in, there are only a few tables. It looks like it could get pretty crowded when it's busy. Overall, though, it's well lit, clean, and comfortable.

The burger that I had was great. It was a large(1/2lb+) patty of high quality meat, and it was well cooked. Lettuce, tomato and onion is available, and the veggies were very fresh. However, the burger is served on lightly toasted white bread instead of a bun.  There was a lot of ketchup, mustard, and mayo, which is usually okay by me, but the bread just fell apart. I ate it with a fork. I'd love to see this sandwich on texas toast or a sturdier bun.

The mashed potatoes were well made also. You can tell they were made in house, and they are just the right amount of lumpy/creamy.

The banana pudding is fantastic. Like, really, really good.

While I was waiting for the food, I thought it seemed to be taking a long time, but when I saw the size of my burger, I understood. It was worth the wait, but if you're in a hurry...

I will definitely be back here. Thanks for great meal!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the JD's food cart that is usually parked on State Street and Gilman Street.

Man! This food cart is amazing. Polish sausages, fried chicken sandwiches, and fried fish sandwiches. I can never get enough of their fried fish sandwich, topped with Frank's hot sauce and a slab of mayo. It's the best late night food, whether you're on a late night walk, need something in your stomach after alcoholic intake, or just passing buy and wanting a late dinner. 

The sad thing is I think their hours vary. But I've seen them open as early as 10 PM and close as late as 2 AM. Sometimes the hours aren't consistent though and they might not show up on occasion during Mondays through Wednesdays."}
{"text":"STEAK. SANDWICH. W/ CHEEESE. FRIES. seriously the best food you will ever sink your teeth into. Drunk or sober. And noooooo they won't double charge you for dat. But for real these guys make unreal food and they take a real care in providing you with quality meals. You know this meat is from free range organic animals. You can almost taste how happy Sally the cow was. Potatoes are top notch. Definitely farmed in Antigo Wisconsin, always fresh, never frozen French fries. You can always enjoy your meal in a smoke free/safe environment. My personal favorite spot is in the fluno center, back doors always open, just sit on the floor and have yourself some authentic Madison cuisine."}
{"text":"Delicious late night food. Stop by on your way home from the bars and indulge. The Philly cheese steak fries are delicious and a great alternative to the typical slice of pizza I usually would get at this hour. I also really like the Mac n cheese, and my roommate loved the wings. 

The only negative is that it takes long-ish for a take out place. But it's something different and you should try it!"}
{"text":"I've had JDS multiple times since it has opened, and usually it is pretty good if you are craving some hot fries and a burger. 

However, last time I ate there I paid 10 dollars for their meat and two sides deal and I got two sloppy sides, mac n cheese, and potato salad, and only 3 chicken wings! I called to say there was a mistake and the lady working there said too bad.

 Overall, not worth the money unless you get the steak burger or the mac n cheese in my opinion."}
{"text":"JD's is best for having a late night snack.  They have pretty much most things you crave at 2 am.  I would recommend their sweet potato fries.  Is usually pretty understaffed but it is a good alternative to some of the other late night places that are packed at 2 am."}
{"text":"This steak burger is everything to me. I used to get one every single time I went out downtown. Luckily, I moved to the west side before things got out of control. The only reason they get a 4 is because you can literally wait 20-30 minutes for a cheeseburger sometimes. Again, though, this is more than just a regular cheeseburger.

I'm not sure if the food truck version is still out, but there would always be 5-10 people in line, and it can take 5-10 mins for each person's order (even though the steak burgers are already cooked!). The man who makes them cares for each steak burger like his own child. He toasts the white bread before carefully picking up and squirting in turn, mustard, mayo and ketchup. Then he uses a knife to slice one perfect slice of tomato for your burger. Next, he rips off a burger shaped piece of lettuce and pats it dry with a paper tower before placing it onto your burger. Last is the patty, which has been warming on the grill. Anyway, delicious burgers, but not everyone is willing to stand outside for 20 mins in -30 for a burger. Personally, I am willing to do that 100% of the time.

Realized one day that there is an actual storefront for JD's (!!!), but had pretty much the same experience. I called ahead 15 mins for my burger, but still had to wait 10 mins when I got there, even though the place was a ghost town."}
