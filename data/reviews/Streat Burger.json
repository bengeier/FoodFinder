{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I love a good burger, and with the wide array of options shown on Streat Burger's menu, I was pretty confident that I'd walk out happy.

This wasn't the case, unfortunately.

I have no complaints about the service. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating, but the food was another story.

I ordered a Brokeback burger with the BBB (that's their burger and bacon blend patty) and my wife had a plainsville turkey burger. We ordered the fried pickle chips and fried cheese curds as an appetizer. 

It took longer than expected for the apps to come out, but the server acknowledged this saying that the pickle chips had to be made twice, and she apologized. It didn't bother me much, as I was happy sipping on a Portside vanilla stout (they have a pretty good beer list).

When we did get the appetizers, the first thing I noticed was that the \"cheese curds\" were the size of mozzarella sticks. I can only begin to imagine what an abomination their poutine is if that's what they serve with it. Also, the \"marinara\" sauce that came with the \"cheese curds\" was more of a paste than a sauce. We ended up using the sauce that came with the pickle chips instead, which was significantly better. 

The pickle chips themselves, however, were probably some of the worst I've had. It was mostly dough with very thin pickle chips. I barely got any of the briney, pickley flavor, but I got plenty of greasy doughy flavor.

The burgers, the reason this place should be known and loved, were probably the most disappointing aspect of the meal. My burger was flavorful enough, but that was mainly because of all the toppings. In fact, that's all I could taste as the BBB was very thin and dry. There was no juiciness, thickness, or beefiness to be found in this anemic patty. What a shame.

I didn't try the turkey burger my wife had, but she said that it was mushy. Our side of fries were nothing to write home about either. The weren't crisp and were slightly under-done.

I really hope this place shapes up, because right now, there are much better options out there in the Cleveland area vying for a burger lover's attention (B-Spot, Flip Side, Dynomite). Streat Burgers should visit these places and take some notes, paying close attention to the burger patty."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing burgers, probably the best burger I've had in this area.  They are a little expensive ($11 for a burger) but the flavor is worth it.  I had the Cuban burger, the combo of beer cheese, mustard onions and pickles was perfect.  And the truffle fries were amazing, not too much oil, just great flavor.  Definitely worth the price for me."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good places to eat in Cleveland. So many that I have a difficult time visiting the same place more than once, unless it's really really good. I would definitely go here again.

I wasn't expecting greatness from the mixed yelp reviews and the fact that I had a Groupon. I'm skeptical of groupon restaurants, especially burger places, but always willing to try.  Everything we ordered was delicious - got the Texas Fries, Cuban revolution burger, and the Seoul burger. 

Beer list and service were both stellar. Lots of choices and nice atmosphere. The dessert (brownie with peanut butter buttercream and candied bacon) was served in a cute carry - out jar and dense, chewy, with just the right amount of salty bacon. Hurry up and get hungry and check this place out!"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and two of my kids. Two very picky kids. We were driving around Lakewood trying to choose from all of the great restaurants.  By the simple fact that there were open tables we stopped here.  
Glad that we did, the food was delicious.  Barbecue wing were great. My kids both ate there entire kids burgers, which is a first. The fries are exceptional. We tried 3 kinds and liked them all. 
Can't wait for my leftovers.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Just used a Social Living coupon  to give Streat Burger a try and was completely delighted! Although not a french fry person, I had to try the truffle with fresh grated  parmesan cheese on the fries,
 and they were INSANELY good!  I ate every hot, crispy, tasty fry!!!  I ordered the Farmhouse Burger, a lovely combination of burger, sweet bacon, fresh tomato, fried egg, white cheddar, garlic aioli and some greens, cooked as I'd requested- medium rare. My husband ordered the Destroyer, with pulled pork, cheese, jalapeno poppers, onion straws and bratwurst, over a chicken patty. Our server was great. We can hardly wait to go back again and try the tarragon seasoned crabcake over chicken and on a waffle.  I salivated watching someone enjoy that order!  My only suggestion is that some of the additions like the onion straws could have been warmed before adding them and by the time everything was put together and served, the sandwiches were warm but not hot. Totally creative menu, casual, come as you are spot with a great beer menu and a wonderfully creative menu! Give this spot a try!  I understand they don't open until 4 and are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Great beer and great food!  The cheesehead burger was to die for and loved the duck fat fries!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you're from Wisconsin, you make a major distinction between cheese curds and mozzarella sticks--like the distinction you make between watermelon and papaya. Which was why we were puzzled when our server delivered the fried cheese curds we'd ordered: 5 elongated, deep-fried panko-covered sticks that looked exactly like 5 mozzarella sticks. And tasted exactly like 5 mozzarella sticks--nicely prepared, but exactly nothing like cheese curds. Is some humbug marketing mozzarella sticks to trusting restauranteurs as cheese curds? The marinara sauce that's served with the mozzarella sticks is a nice, chunky-paste consistency, although a tad too salty for our taste. 

The burger concept here is fun--you pick a ground protein type (beef, beef/bacon, turkey, or vegetarian), base (bun type or greens), and style (a focal topping with garnishes). One choice at our table was the whole wheat bun and Farmhouse style (fried egg, maple glazed bacon, white cheddar, marinated tomato, garlic aioli, arugula). Another was the same burger with greens base and Crabby Kennedy style (tarragon butter crab cake, avocado,marinated tomato, garlic aioli, arugula). Both burgers came with a small portion of lemon garlic cole slaw, which produced an intriguing meld of flavors and was absolutely delicious. 

The burgers may weigh the same as those typically found at a specialty burger restaurant but, because they are thinner than you typically see, it likely would be difficult to serve them any rarer than medium well. Maybe that's why, we realized later, our server hadn't asked how we wanted ours prepared; ours were delivered well-done, which makes for a burger on the dry side. The bacon flavor was nicely prominent but, with added seasoning, the burgers were also on the salty side. The much anticipated Crabby Kennedy crab cake failed to deliver on taste, texture, or tarragon.

Service was spotty--we were seated and then greeted by our server quickly. Then we waited a lonnnnngggg time for our server to take our orders. After that, our food came in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"The stars finally aligned my burger cravings with a time Streat Burger was open.  In the past I've had a hard time getting there when it is open since the hours were really weird - just 4 pm to 10 pm  most days and closed every Monday, while competitors like the Buckeye Beer Engine are open lunch through late night almost every single day and thus much easier to just drop in on a whim. In recent months Streat Burger did expand their hours a bit and are open for lunch on a couple of days, although still closed Mondays, and frankly it's difficult to keep track of what days they are open when, but get there I finally did. 

This place is kind of the Melt of Burgers, with less bar action since they just have bottled beers.  By the Melt of Burgers, I mean that the menu is based on taking an ordinary sandwich - for Melt, grilled cheese, and for Streat, a burger - and jazzing it up with ginormous piles of topping combos and ways to serve it (beer battered, for instance).  This tends to bring out a goodly crowd of people who like interesting flavor combos and even more people who just like the idea of a big honking piled-high hot Dagwood sandwich.  But it tends to leave out those of us who are purists and just want a nicely cooked, reasonably sized, and more traditional sandwich. You can, of course, go to Streat Burger or Melt and order a plainer option than their vaunted menu specials, but then you feel like you're missing the point, especially since given the prices you better be having something special or you could go home and cook it just about as well for much less money. 

To their credit, Streat's combos are reasonably tasty combinations of things like cheese, mushrooms, bacon, BBQ sauce, fried egg etc. - not the \"what crazy, gutwrenching stuff can we throw on a burger\" like you get at PYT in Philly and some other hip places of the moment. My problem is that when I eat a burger, I like to taste the burger.  I can't taste it if it's overwhelmed by sauce, peppers, veggies, cheese, fried batter etc.  By that point I'm not even sure there's a burger in there or just a textured chewy meatlike wad.  

They serve fries in flavors like duck and truffle to go with the burgers.  The fries taste good but are a bit on the limp side - I like 'em crispy.  They also offer stuff like poutine which seems to be a thing nowadays, but not being a big fan of poutine I'm not the right audience for that. 

Nevertheless, I would eat there again, or visit their food truck. I would just order one of the plainer burger options with maybe 2 or 3 things instead of the full monty of a half dozen.  Bad news:  they are closing this location in early February due to a lease issue, which makes me sad to lose a decent local business, even if they are just a three-star for me."}
{"text":"I had the streat burger on wheat Palo Alto style (minus the let/tom) and it was so so so good. Fries were okay but I am not really a fan of skin on fries in the first place. The garlic aioli that came with the fries was amazing."}
{"text":"Four of us decided to try out Streat Burger on Friday night.  We had never been there, but a coworker suggested it.  We got there around 6PM on Friday and were seated right away.  Place is cheerful looking, bright colors and a large Flat Screen to keep up with the days sporting events.  We started with drinks, and that's when we found out that they don't have a liquor license.  They have close to 100 craft beers available, but no booze.  One person in our group ended up with water!  Not the end of the world at all.  The rest of us tried different beers, I had the Columbus IPA.  Very good, but it was on their specials list, so may not be available all the time.

All of us ended up ordering burgers & fries, different toppings of course.  I had the Seoul Burger and it was right up there with my top 5 burgers of all time!  It was topped with candied jalapenos, a fried egg and a few other items.  Great flavor and cooked to a perfect medium, which also made it nice and juicy.  Fries were hot & crispy right out of the fryer.  All of us had different burgers and left our plates empty.  My one friend had their Peanut burger(it was opening day), it was a burger that was lightly covered with peanuts(It was on their specials board).  He loved it, and had it served open face on a Masa waffle.

Streat Burger is definitely my new favorite restaurant in Lakewood, and I will be back.  Couple of cons: It's small, maybe 14 tables -- mostly 4 tops and a few deuces throughout.  If the restaurant is packed, folks will be bumping into your table.  Also no liquor service, and while this is no biggie to me, my one friend wasn't too crazy about that."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it never disappoints.  The quality of the burgers and the combinations are unrivaled.  Burgers are cooked right, if you order a burger medium, it will be medium.  The fries are great too.  My only complaint would be that they should have a actual bar in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place.

My boyfriend and I live right down the street from this place, so we'd been meaning to try it. We stopped in on a Tuesday night, and they had the patio open so we were seated outside. They had an extensive beer list, with a limited selection on tap. Our server was knowledgeable and encouraging about the food, which made me feel more confident that our dinners were going to be good. Unfortunately, we both didn't care for the food at all.

The menu choices sounded inventive and tasty, A for effort there. We got the fried pickle chips to start, as I'm a huge fan of fried pickles, and they were kind of a disaster. The pickle slices were wafer thin, almost McDonald's-esque, inside a thick mound of overly greasy fried batter. You almost didn't know the pickles were in there. If you want pickle chips, head to the Market in Rocky River - they're pretzel encrusted and they nail this appetizer.

For dinner I ordered the Farmhouse burger (fried egg, bacon, tomato, arugula) and my boyfriend got the Michael Slyman/Symon (not sure which it was called). The combos sounded really good. The burger patties themselves were really lacking - they were thin and neither of our burgers were cooked to our preference of medium and medium rare. With a burger so thin, I don't know how you could even achieve a warm pink center. I feel like I would have cut these burgers some slack if I wasn't at a full-blown burger restaurant. There are so many amazing places to grab a burger in this city, so if you're not going to do it well, you aren't going to last. Same goes for the duck fat fries--when there are places in Cle that nail duck fat fries, you can't just sprinkle dried rosemary on them and call it a day. 

Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back. It pains me to say it, so I hope they can make some improvements to their methods--maybe not try to hard to be inventive, just focus on making an incredible, juicy burger."}
{"text":"Had a delicious burger Cuban-style on Saturday.  Great beers and service was top notch.  Shout-out to our server - she was great.   We asked  about the Bloody Mary ketchup and she brought a side for free w/o the 50 cent charge.  Nice!  

 We sat inside but the outdoor patio has some potential. 

Suggestion:   Add some window boxes and greenery to the patio - feels a bit too much like the parking lot it was.  

Fried pickles were OK, but no need to get them again.   The Streat Sauce it came with was uber-tasty in the fries with my burger.  Next time I'm trying the Buffalo Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"Delicious options for vegans and meat eaters alike. Service was phenominal and food was worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Good Mac and cheese but that was it. Uncooked meat and just okay to below average service"}
{"text":"Not my kind of burger. I ordered the Cuban which was kind of weird. Besides the fried pickles on top of the burger it was a bust. The burger sat on a bed of arugula which was strange. The burger itself had so much sauce on top that it killed the flavor of the meat all together plus made it super sloppy! Won't be back"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I must say the food was fantastic. I love the setup of the menu: you first pick the burger style, then the actual type of patty, finally the bun or other option, then the side. They had some pretty unique toppings like cola cured bacon, kimchi, or frizzled onions.  

We went with the \"Michael Slyman\" style burger and the Parmesan truffle fries- so good I coulda slapped my mama! The best part was the corned beef hash brown that came on the burger. I could eat those alone all day. 

Service was great and our server, Zach, knew a lot about the beers on the menu (there were quite a few microbrews).

Overall great experience with great food and a low key, unpretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a GREAT selection of burgers and serving styles, appetizers are not 'plain jane' like any other restaurant and the beer selection is excellent.   Favorites were the Streat Burger Palo Alto style, the BBB burger, the duck fries were out of this world! the wings and yes, even the desserts.  This is the kind of place you can come back to over and over again to sample something new."}
{"text":"After seeing a post on Mason Creamery's Instagram, I knew I needed it: Nitro milk stout float topped with Mason Creamery's Nutella ice cream. Holy cow!!!!!! It was amazing. I am a big fan of Mason's so I was double excited. My friend and I split the duck confit french fries; fries fried in duck fat and topped with duck confit, shoestring onions and garlic aioli. Insane!!!!! I am a complete french fry freak. The four stars is for the food, the atmosphere was a little strange... It was a gorgeous Saturday and the place was dead. They even have a patio. Maybe people just don't know about it yet? I hope they do because as I am writing this post I am seriously considering stopping for lunch to try what they're known for - burgers. And duh, a Nutella beer float!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say that this spot turned out to be quite disappointing for a number of reasons.  These days Cleveland is filled with a TON of places to get a gourmet burger (and we've tried many of them!), so an $11+ dollar burger better be something pretty special...these were not.

My wife and I started our meal with a shared appetizer, Streat Poutine.  She had never had Poutine so i was anxious to share the experience, unfortunately their version is far from traditional, covering their fries with beer battered NY cheddar, bacon and a honey mustard-based sauce.  Although is was a gooey mess (in a good way!) the flavors were odd and just did not do it for me.  On to the burgers!

I decided to pay homage to my (adopted) hometown Cleveland by trying a Michael Slyman...beef patty topped with a corned beef hash brown, Gruyere cheese, candied bacon and sweet -n spicy mustard.  Surprisingly, the meat patties here are quite thin (like McDonald's thin) making it difficult to get the temp right...and they missed the mark.  I ordered the burger medium (my wife does not prefer medium rare as I do and since we were sharing I upped the temp) and it came out well done.  On top of that, the fried corned beef hash brown was also slightly overcooked, leading to a very dry burger experience.

My wife chose another of our favorite burger styles...Farmhouse with glazed bacon, fried egg, NY white cheddar, tomato, spring mix greens and garlic aioli.  This burger was also ordered at a medium temp, and it barely had any trace of pink within.  Although better than my burger, it still lacked a juicy quality and was just average in overall flavor combinations.

Accompanying our burgers were standard fires (good!) and a side salad (which was also fine).

Our only other complaint about the meal was my wife's drink.  This probably sounds petty (and it is) and a bit of a rant (which it is)...but she ordered a standard Arnold Palmer.  Our server was specific to tell her that because he had to mix lemonade and tea that she could only have one drink (no free refills), which she agreed to.  When the bill came he charged us full price for a lemonade and a tea...that was $5.50 for one regular-sized glass of liquid, whereas my 12oz bottled beer was $4.  when we challenged the charge  he said \"oh sorry, I forgot to tell you that part, and my manager will not budge on reducing the charge\"...why didn't he just bring her a FULL glass of tea and a FULL glass of lemonade then?

Okay...rant over...but that was just the kicker on an already less-than-stellar experience for a $44 burger meal.  We will be dining of grilled beef between a bun elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"The first things I noticed as we approached were awesome improvements to the former 56 West location, a bike rack and a nice patio added to the back. The interior also bears marked improvements both in decor and offerings with the front room now boasting a \"99 bottles of beer\" wall, coolers with mix and match craft brews for take out and, thank goodness, taps. The menu concept isn't so different than 56 West, with a hybrid build your own burger menu concept, but the menu is a bit confusing and misleading. Our waitress greeted us warmly and served us well, but she was incorrect in her advice that a bucket of fries would amply cover our group of 3. The bucket of fries is enough for a two person split, if both people want a small side, but it's not quite what we pictured as a bucket. We ordered a second bucket, which, on the bright side was only 3 bucks, but which initially came without fry sauce. Our burgers were fine. The meat eaters enjoyed their high quality Streat burgers, but no one raved about his/her plate. The veg burger was also fine, but the crab cake was just okay. The two mini slivers of avocado were sad, but the marinated tomatoes were delicious. There aren't many beers on tap, but it's a big improvement to have them, and the short list of draft beers includes mostly local titles which is great. The management almost seems to be running the restaurant with the same policies as a street vendor with things such as no substitutions and emphasis on fast service."}
{"text":"I was actually trying to go to Jammy Buggars today until I learned that they're closed Sundays so I figured I would check this new place out.. I am a fan!! 

I'm not sure if their website is even up yet so I'll give the basic rundown of the food.. Their main thing is a build your own burger type of situation. They have about six protein options, from turkey burgers to a bacon burger to a veggie burger (made with quinoa - yum!).  Then choose regular bun, whole wheat bun, salad or a gluten free waffle thing. After that, you can either pick all your own toppings or choose from suggested combos. I got the Palo Alto and it had avocado, goat cheese, tomato, arugula and some flavored ailoi.. It was really yummy!! 

You can also get a macaroni and cheese dish with crazy toppings, salad, loaded fries or a few other side options (including vegetarian chili). Their beer list is like 3 pages long AND they have the option to build your own 6 pack to take home with you! The fries were tasty but those are the only non-burger item I tried.  

About the only issues we had: I'm bummed that there isn't a bar in this place because the food definitely lends well to a bar vibe. I's also not big so it might get a long wait once it picks up in popularity, and the space was just a little weird in terms of how sound would carry (you can easily hear conversations at the next table). Oh, and I wasn't a fan of the music but no big deal there! 

They said there will be a patio soon, which will be an awesome addition. Our server was really attentive and someone (maybe the owner?) came by to get feedback on the food. Since they're new, they seem really open to feedback at this point but when it comes to the food, I had nothing bad to say! All very tasty and creative."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in there this past Saturday at around 7 p.m., and the place was packed! Thus our hopes were up and expecting amazing food, but unfortunately we were terribly disappointed. The 'duck fat fries' are absolutely dripping in grease. They are first fried, THEN tossed in duck fat, which leaves a soggy, greasy mess. The icing on the greasy cake was the lack of overall seasoning on the fries - it didn't taste like they were salted at all. They were served with a Miso Ginger Aioli, which was broken and tasteless.
We ordered the \"Meat me in Philly\" and the \"Farmhouse\" burgers. The toppings on both burgers were very high quality and excellently executed, as was the soft and sturdy bun. Unfortunately the burger itself was horribly greasy, and tasted like the blend had too much short rib and/or brisket in it and not enough sirloin. There was almost no meat flavor to the patty, and it DRIPPED with oil. It was so bad that my husband, who can easily down a burger (and a half), didn't even finish half of this burger due to an upset stomach ache from all of the grease. Ugh. Perhaps their non-meat options are a better pairing to the excellent toppings and bun. But it's supposed to be a burger place...
They do have a great beer selection, but it is expensive. $6.50 for a pint of Conway's on draft? Yikes. $9 for a bottle of Burton Baton? They're definitely making their profits on the alcohol sales.
Needless to say we won't be back. There are better burger options in town."}
{"text":"I think this place is good, not super amazing, but yummy. I like that you can order any burger over greens or pick one of several bun options. The menu is very creative and has a lot to offer. A cute little neighborhood spot to walk to when you don't feel like venturing very far."}
{"text":"Aside from one (semi-major) issue, we had a great time here. Our issue occurred when my mom cut into her burger, and the first thing she saw was a hair in her food. I knew from walking by the side door (which is visible to the kitchen), that nobody in the kitchen were wearing hats/hair nets. The restaurant acted quickly to get her something else, and we did see when we left that everybody was then wearing hats, but it's still a big screw up for a new restaurant.

On the food front, it certainly gives b-spot a run for its money, but it is a bit expensive for a burger."}
{"text":"Great Burgers. SImple, informal setting. Pick your meat, bun and how you want it \"Streated\" (assorted toppings and prep). The serving size is great; enough where you won't go home hungry, but not so much you feel stuffed. The fries and dipping sauces are GREAT."}
{"text":"Our first experience was OK. The space is relatively small, there were maybe 5 tables total when we arrived for Sunday dinner. We had to wait a bit to be seated, but the waitress apologized. I was disappointed after creating my burger from the menu options to find out they no longer have turkey burgers, but now had chicken. Made some minor tweaks & went with chicken. Pros- fried cheese curds & their fries are amazing. The duck fat rosemary fries with beer cheese dip are crisp & addictive. The sweet potato fries were also quite good. The burgers were alright. Cons- very small space, service was just ok, & I I hit something hard in my chicken burger twice. Assuming bone chips? That kills a burger for me. Will try again, solid place, just need to feel out the menu more."}
{"text":"On my trip through Lakewood to try every restaurant, this one was next up and I must say I was a little disappointed.  My experience was as it explains, A-OK.  Didn't leave me craving more and wouldn't put it at the list of my recommendations to out of towners. 

A friend and I had hadn't seen each other in a while and he was craving a burger so this is where it landed us, and when we walked in I knew immediately this was not the place for us because you could hear a pin drop it was SO QUIET!  I will be honest and admit I am not a quiet talker, well in fact, I am a very loud talker.  This was not the place for me, and just could feel the awkwardness that was about to ensue.   

We sat down and the wait staff was super nice, no complaints there! We both said we had not been there before and she gave us a run down of the menu, drinks etc. and then gave us some much needed time to think. 

I decided to go with the turkey burger, The Palo Alto style.  When my meal arrived it looked delicious and it was one of the biggest turkey burgers I have ever had.  It just wasn't bursting with flavor.  The meat didn't have any herb flavoring in my opinion and I was hoping to have a little more garlic aioli to help in this matter, but that wasn't there either.  The tomato, avocado, and argula was fresh and delicious, but the overall was just eh.  

I wanted to love it and maybe I did not order the right thing so I will definitely give it another try, but I would maybe pick another stop for a burger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner tonight, and we were both very pleased with this place, from the friendly attentive service to the food. I got the veggie burger served on the masa waffle, and he had the chicken burger with grilled veggies on it and the duck fat fries. The veggie burger was made with quinoa which gave it a great texture, and the waffle was fantastic even on its own. He liked his food as well, and the duck fat fries were good. My only negative about this place is they only have a beer license (and their beer selection is impressive if you drink beer, which I don't), and no wine license (which I drink a fair bit). 

It also has cool graffiti/street art inside to fit their theme, which is something I love.:-)"}
{"text":"Yay it no longer smells like hippies!

Streat just opened their flagship restaurant in the old 56 West and it is delicious! My husband and I walked over there for an impromptu Saturday dinner. We've eaten their truck's fare a couple of times and had a generally positive experience so we were excited to see them opening up within walking distance of our house. 

We had had the displeasure of dining at 56 West once and left with a less than positive review and me with an allergy migraine. The patchouli was overwhelming which makes me question what the smell was hiding. But I digress. 

The first thing our server asks us is are we beer drinkers. . . already I know we are going to love this place. She hands us their rather impressive beer list but we decided on a couple of Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stouts on draft (that stuff is too good to pass up on draft). Even better all drafts are 5 dollars. The Kentucky stout is usually more expensive if you were unaware. 

We decided after seeing the portions leaving the kitchen that it would be prudent to just split a burger and an order of fries. We decided on the Michael Slyman and the Texas fries. We got a regular bun and burger. The service was quick. And it was delicious. The corned beef hash patty with the gruyere and candied bacon was just an explosion of flavor. And the mustard was just the icing on the cake and it was good icing. So good we ordered extra to dip our fries in. The texas fries were great. The bourbon barbecue was sweet and smoky and brought some great flavor. The pork was high quality homemade pulled pork greatness. The beer cheese sauce was wonderful but was definitely second chair to the pork. 

Between an inviting atmosphere, friendly staff, speedy service and great food we will be back. Again and again."}
{"text":"I admit, I was hesitant to go here because half the reviews are stellar and the other half are not so hot. But luckily, a friend insisted on going here after his graduation when we offered to take him out for a celebratory meal.

I didn't have high hopes because of the other reviews but I never write a place off based solely on that, or even 1-2 bad experiences (we all have bad nights). Overall I was impressed the first time there and have been back several times since. We usually go during dinner time during a weekday and there was plenty of seating to choose from. The chairs and tables are comfortable and the overall layout is conducive to conversation. The walls have a sort of graffiti decor to them. 

I was impressed by the sizable beer menu, and while looking it over we all picked out about 3-4 each that we would be interested in trying. We tend to do this because a large menu almost always indicates that they don't have all of them in stock, rather you have to throw out several suggestions before a place has one you want. This wasn't the case at all here, they had everyone's first choice in stock. So already, I'm happy. Our waiter was also a nice guy, quick and attentive. I don't think we even had to ask him for anything, he just knew and obliged (like when drink refills were needed, etc.).

The food was great! I've had several of their burgers and all of their specialty fries. Lord, do I love a creative french fry dish. All have been good. My favorite isn't actually a burger though, it is the buffalo macaroni with chicken. Just enough heat and great spicy flavor, I hate buffalo that is all heat and no taste. This was the perfect mix. It also reheats really well especially because their take home containers are made of foil. You can just take the lid off and pop it right into the oven the next day. The burgers are juicy but never greasy. I hate the piled high type burgers that are just plain wet and drip down your hands and wrist when you bite into them, it is gross. But Streat Burgers are juicy without the oily mess. I also get their coffee a lot, just black. It is a very dark flavor, balanced acidity. It tastes like it is perhaps made in a french press or a percolator which is refreshing, it doesn't taste like it just came from a big pot of dollar store coffee that has been out on the burner for 4 hours. Though, I've never asked them how they prepare it. 

The menu is laid out well too. I guess you could maybe compare it to Happy Dog's menu where you pick out the type of meat you want, how you want your sandwich prepared, etc. working your way down the list. It allows for a lot of different combinations.

In short, I love a good burger and fries. This seems a lot like B-Spot only within walking distance of my house. As much as I love B-Spot, I usually go here now because they are just as good and much closer. They are also a bit brighter and less noisy than B-Spot which is nice for catching up with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Eh I really wanted to like this place because it is close to our house, but my husband and I will be returning.  We waited 40 minutes for our burgers and my husbands was almost raw.  Overpriced, waitress was nice & knowledgeable but food was terrible."}
{"text":"So... yeah, I still can't get real poutine here in Cleveland.*** But first... let's cover the main stuff:

Burger places, I've noticed in the last few years, have two tricks they're all using: 

1. Offer a gazillion different toppings and sauces to mask the burger, usually exotic sounding combinations of flavors and things your average burger eater wouldn't usually put on a patty. 
2. Name the varieties of burgers something cute/sexy/silly, sometimes so off the edge that reasonably mature people feel goofy ordering it by name. (For the record, I'm not mature enough to feel goofy doing that.) 

Neither of these tricks is an evil thing in itself, in my opinion. It's perfectly acceptable to have peanut butter as a topping for a burger (I've still not tried that myself, but I'm very much a \"to each his own\" kind of thinker) and I am still of the mindset that you score creativity points for naming menu items, even if it is something that might make your mom blush. The problem is that far too often the burger places employing these tricks are using them to disguise the low quality meat they're using... you pile enough toppings on a frozen patty and you don't ever taste the freezer burn really, and maybe people will overlook the faults if the name of the burger makes them giggle. 

Streat Burger uses both of these tricks (though the names are not overly silly I don't think), and despite the fact that I have some love built in from the Streat Mobile world, I was a little leery because so far I've not come across a place with these tricks in place where the burger could really stand on its own, or with a simple bun and minimal condiments... 

Thankfully, I was delightfully surprised to find that the burger in my burger was super tasty all on its own -- and the toppings just made it that much better. (I had the Cuban Revolution burger - almost but not really like a putting Cuban sandwich on a burger.) The first thing I did was to dig out a chunk of meat without the toppings - and it was juicy and tasty and fresh.

Really, this was one of the better burgers I've had in Cleveland, and I'm looking forward to going back and trying a few of the other combos. 

Now for the poutine critique: 
We started with the Streat Poutine, which honestly was the main reason I wanted to eat there. I developed a taste for poutine a few years ago after spending a few weekends in Toronto, and while the Streat Poutine was pretty yummy, it's not *really* poutine. The cheese curds are battered and fried (so you don't get the joy of the cheese curds melting in with the super hot gravy...) and the sauce - billed as gravy and aioli - doesn't really have that brown-gravy-salty-disgusting thing that real poutine manages to make delicious. So, I still don't have real poutine here in Cleveland. (Man, I gotta get back to Toronto again one day.) Again -- Streat Poutine is pretty tasty, but I think next time I'll try one of the other creative fry combos they've got. (And the fries by themselves were perfectly good.) 

The staff was super friendly and right on point - never had an empty glass and it was smiles all around. 

The only downbeat really was the dessert. LOVE the concept -- changing specials of desserts in a jar that you get to take home... I mean, I don't really need a collection of little Mason jars, but why not... But the execution wasn't quite on the mark. The choices the night I was there both spoke to me - a sweet potato pie and red velvet cake. I left with 2 of each to go, to share with my roommate. The red velvet was kind of ok - but that was mainly on the strength of the frosting layered in -- the cake itself was too dense and chewy and didn't really have any flavor other than sweet. And the sweet potato pie was... well, it was yucky. It was salty and there were too many competing spice flavors happening in the jar and tasted nothing like any sweet potato pie I've had, and the layering probably seemed like a good idea -- sweet potato stuff and marshmallow fluff layered over a dusty inch of what seemed to be a take on crumbled graham cracker crust -- but if you actually eat it out of the jar... well, you end up getting to sweet dust at the bottom. I'm sad to report that the roomie and I both tossed most of it out. 


So to wrap up a lot of words that most people will never read anyway: 

- Burgers: 5 stars. Juicy and delish. 
- Poutine: tasty but don't expect traditional Canadian style stuff
- Dessert: Skip it probably. But don't let that stop you from going there for a burger.


***If anyone knows a spot in Cleveland with traditional poutine, please tell me! And don't give me Greenhouse Tavern -- theirs is yummy, make no mistake -- but it's still not the brown gravy salt lick of a melted cheese curd mess that I'm looking for, y'know?"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I walked way highly unlikely to return.  Okay, so you might say, \"you don't eat beef so what did you expect?\"  It's true, I ordered their veggie burger which was a soggy, mushy, tasteless mess load down by their equally overcooked, saucy toppings.  I'm not sure putting a beef burger into the mix would have helped things but at least those looked like the held together. No one at my table declared, \"delish!\" or \"I just love this place\" but rather we marked it as tried and left feeling a little like Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh, \"Oh, bother.\"  The redeeming thing is a great beer list but since I didn't have one tonight but they got an extra star from me just for that and being a local spot.  Oh, as for getting a veggie burger they should realize this is Lakewood and a world where lots of us prefer healthier veggie burgers + that's no excuse for mediocre food. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with the food, but for a $12 burger I expect better!! The burger was on the small side, and the bun was ginormous, perhaps to trick me? With all the good burgers in Lakewood, this would be my last stop."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for this place.  Overall, very disappointed.  The buffalo chicken mac and cheese - the chicken was great - fresh, not frozen.  However, the mac and cheese was gross.  Macaroni was overcooked and the cheese sauce was stringy and just had a bad taste, likely due to the buffalo sauce they add to it.  Don't recommend it.  Also tried the Farmhouse burger on mesa waffle with truffle fries.  The bacon was under cooked and very fatty (we like our bacon crispy).  The mesa waffle is not a good recommendation for a burger.  The menu says \"savory and sweet\".  It's definitely more sweet than savory.  The meat was decent, but we couldn't find the cheddar cheese that supposedly topped the burger.  The truffle fries - when we came in to pick up our carryout order, the fries were cold, so we asked for a fresh order...and I think they just threw the same fries back in the fryer; because when we tried them at home, they were dry and burnt.   No truffle/parmesan seasoning. If you're in Lakewood looking for a good burger, try the other options in town.  Additionally, it was Saturday night @ 8:30 PM and only 2 tables inside and one couple eating outside on the patio...makes me wonder.  The plus side - the service staff are very nice!"}
{"text":"Streat Burger is what Happy Dog is to hot dogs.  It is what Barrio is to tacos.  You \"build\" your burger with a huge array of ingredients of your choosing.  It's a fun concept so why not?  Because I'm lazy, I got the Farmhouse burger and it was good, but I'm pretty sure they're all good so just pick whatever suits you at the time.  What you need to try though are the Streat Poutine fries...unless you're dieting.  Beer Battered Cheese Curds, Bacon Gravy, Dijon Lardons, Garlic Aioli.  Oh, and fries.  Hell yes."}
{"text":"First off this place is small.  Very small.  Service was good and helpful.  There are two guys working the front a tall guy very nice and a guy with rings in his lips 
Very scary.    Not a  smile to be found.  

Food took a while to come out but was very good. 

Nice place but get there soon.   No way they can make a profit."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was subpar.  I had heard several times before actually heading to Streat Burger that the service was pretty horrible, but we figured after the USA World Cup game we would check it out.

Little did i realize, it would take up the rest of our evening.  We basically had to beg to have them open the patio for us on an almost perfect Cleveland evening (which are hard to come by) after that it was an adventure to try to get chairs unlocked for more of our friends to join.  We were bringing business, yet were left feeling like a burden.

One table of our friends filled up before the other so that table got menus first...and got to order drinks first...and got to order food...at least fifteen minutes before the other table got to set eyes on a menu.  Our friend actually went inside and came out with 6 cans of beer to distribute as the server was finally passing out menus and asked \"how did you get those?\" Well.  We came from a bar, and were thirsty, so we made it happen.

The food was great, no major complaints there aside from the fries tasting like my high school cafeteria, BUT, the burgers were delicious.  Service continued to be bad throughout our time there as she asked if things were together, then came out with new checks all printed incorrectly.  My friend would like me to say it's okay because she was 20 (not even legally allowed to open our beers) but to me it was inexcusable...you work for your tips, and she treated us like overflow that she was annoyed with. 

I won't venture back...good burger or not, when I'm spending that much money I expect more."}
{"text":"This is the place I go when I want to sit down and have a burger rather than ordering one from dynamite and sitting downtown.

The food is pretty good. The fried pickle chips and dipping sauce were amazing though! The breading was thick and crispy and the chips were slightly acidic with a nice sweetness to them. I ordered the Hawaiian Lei with pulled pork which was pretty good. I think I will order with extra salsa next time to add a little more sweetness.

Service was not very good. We were initially greeted by the host and ordered drinks from him. He was very enthusiastic and fun which started off the meal well. Our server however was not good. She greeted a table that sat down after us and took their orders before even greeting us. She was not very attentive the rest of the meal either and was tipped accordingly. 

Overall I would come back here again. The food was good at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you that everything on the menu is amazing. I'm sure it is. I've only tried one burger off the menu (the brokeback - it was fantastic)... Every time we go, I can't not order the weekly special. Last week they had a burger with a damned sweet potato hash brown and beets. How could I pass that up? I also wish that I could tell you that every beer they offer is amazing, but if I could, I'd probably be dead. They've only been open a short while after all. Last but not least, whoever thought of the idea of putting their desserts into take-home jars should be awarded a Nobel Prize."}
{"text":"They have a great beer list.  The veggie burger was awesome but the patty was twice as big as the bun! My husband got the turkey burger.  His reaction was, I should have gotten beef this has no flavor.  Also they allow subtractions but no substitutions.  So Grant couldn't get onions added to save his life.  Next time we will bring them in my purse and he will get a beef patty."}
{"text":"Lakewood is getting pretty ridiculous, you guys. I can barely walk down a half-block without being visually assaulted by some new restaurant. Then I'm forced to cross the street to get a smell of what's cookin', and then I'm pressured by my stomach to actually go inside and buy some food. DAMN MY INTERNAL DESIRES. Anyway, I hadn't been here before under this name (it was 54 West or something a couple years ago?) and hit this joint with a few pals before a show one night. They suggested it, and I'm reeeeeally glad they did. The burgers here were top-notch and among the best I've had in all of the Cleveland diaspora. And the fries, my god, the fries. They were like McDonald's fries on steroids, that's how good they were. Their beer selection was pretty good too, for such a small place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here, and I'm impressed. I'll get the bad out of the way first. The service was fairly slow but understandable since it was the last days of a Living Social and they only had 2 waiters. My other complaint was that my burger was very overlooked (I ordered Medium and got close to Well Done). My boyfriends was cooked perfectly so I'll assume that mine was an anomaly. The toppings on each burger were amazing. The truffle fries were also equally amazing. Excellent beer selection. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went to this place today and i had the chicken burger cuban revolution it was very good but they dont have filtered water and the bun was stale but it was very tasty"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday for my birthday with 4 adults and my 9 month old daughter. When we got there (early) there was only one other couple there with a baby, so that was nice. The food is AMAZING! The Michael Slyman burger is so good, I was upset that my husband and I got one to share. The garlic aoli for the french fries was out of this world. I want to be buried in that stuff. Yum! I'm not a drinker, but the boys seemed to be happy with the beer selection. I had an old school cherry coke and it was divine. Definitely a great spot for dinner. We're already planning a trip back!"}
{"text":"I will chalk up my so so experience with my choice of burger, Brokeback, Streat Beef, Streat Classic Bun and Duck Fat Fries. The BBQ sauce on this baby was sweet and delicious and the jalapeños provided nice a spicy contrast. I tend to stay away from heavily battered anything and the Frizzled Onions are just that, tasty but more onion ring than caramelized. This place is good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"Great for all walks of life.. From pure carnivore to vegan. Deelish."}
{"text":"During the most recent blizzard, Sean and I came home from work exhausted and starving. No food in the house to speak of and no ambition to really go anywhere. Enter Streat - right at the end of our block. We decided to give the place another shot after about a 6 month breather from our original not-so-great experience. 

I'm happy to say that most of the issues we had on our first visit were not issues this time. We were promptly greeted and seated this time. Although we still had to wait a good while for some waters and beers, the service was a bit better.

I can't remember what Sean had, but I got the regular Streat Burger with the 'Cheesehead' style. I was excited to try their rendition of 'cheese curds' to see if they can hold up against the glorious curds of Wisconsin. 

Verdict: not really cheese curds, but still quite tasty! Really the 'cheese curds' are very large chunks of cheese which are deep fried so it's really more of a mozzarella stick on your burger than anything. Don't get me wrong, still very tasty and I LOVED that gravy (aka liquid crack) they put on there. This burger was very messy but it was damn good.  We had fries for a side as well which were quite tasty but the garlic aioli was WAY TOO garlicky even for me. I was tasting garlic for hours afterward.

Overall, this place has majorly stepped up from our first visit. We will be back to explore the menu combos in the future."}
{"text":"Five stars! The pulled pork was AMAZING! I could gotten two sandwiches. The fries are excellent. 2nd time there. I can say this but will not take it down to a 4 star. When they first opened, staff seemed to care more and seemed happier, tonight to get a smile seemed like a chore. But eh, we all have those days."}
{"text":"I checked out this burger place last week while I was searching for something new to try. Turns out they have been open since July! The restaurant is small but inviting and the service was top notch. I tried the Farmhouse burger which had lettuce tomato, cheese, fried egg, as well as maple bacon on it. the maple bacon made the burger, you could smell it when they set it down at the table. The actual meat itself on the burger I could tell was not the best beef I  have ever had, but the creative toppings made up for the lack of flavor. My favorite part was the bun, not to soggy but not too thick. The fries were also good, but nothing memorable. This may not be the best burger in Northeast Ohio, but I will defiantly be back to try some other creative combos."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I live really close to this new burger place so we decided to walk there on a Friday evening. At first glance, the menu looked innovative and fun! I love the option of picking your own protein (burger, chicken, pulled pork, etc) and bun! Instead of a bun, you can opt for a bed of salad greens or even a gluten free waffle (I can't wait to try that next!).

There beer list is pretty impressive and, I agree with the other reviewer, that I wish they had a bar to go with it. There were 6 beers on tap and also they have some old school sodas you can choose from as well.

I ordered the Palo Alto burger on a whole wheat bun and it was delicious. We share their bucket of fries with garlic aioli sauce and beer cheese on the side. The fries include one sauce, I wish you could try them all at once (they are 50 cents for each extra one you add). 

All in all, we are looking forward to returning to this cute burger joint."}
{"text":"Had a groupon for this place.  The serve was good. Fries were really good. And it's cool you can build your burger. Better than I thought it was going to be."}
{"text":"Good food fast. Great ordering structure where you get a lot of choice for one easy price. Great beer selection too!"}
{"text":"As the saying goes, one door closes and another one opens. Or as Milton Berle said \"If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door\". Streat Burger opened up within a month of the closing of Eddie N Eddies. There is an over saturation of burger joints in Cleveland. I still maintain that Annex Bar in Solon has the best burger in the area even if the place is grimy and looks like Patrick Swayze should be in there (Road House). I have enjoyed the food truck Streat Mobile Bistro so I was excited to try the restaurant. I took my mom out for dinner on Tuesday. The food was good. We tried both the Palo Alto and Hawaiian options. We tried both the beef and pulled pork over greens and on a bun. The pulled pork was great and rivaled the excellent pulled pork sandwich from Lava Lounge. We also split the salad with black beans and corn. The beer list is very solid and I hope that this place does well."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the service was great. I don't think they are quite worthy of 5 stars, but I would definitely come back to this place. The beer list is amazing, and I cannot argue with that! It's several pages long and they have anything your heart can desire.
I'm not a burger person; I have to really be in the mood. But, when I am craving a hamburger, I like to customize my own. The options available were plentiful, and substitutions were welcome. I had the plain cow patty, while my date had the bacon-mixed. Both were delicious and juicy. I had the farmhouse burger, and everything was worthy of a great review. The bacon was crisp, the bun was deliciously carby, and the egg was just slightly runny in the center...yum! Get the parmesan-herb fries; they were exceptionally better than the duck fat ones."}
{"text":"Food: Nothing bad but nothing amazing. While the burger menu has some creative sounding options the Palo Alto option I chose didn't wow me. Its flavour was bland and didn't scream specialised. Also, something was \"tougher\" than it should have been - perhaps just too well done of a burger, which it was completely well done even though I ordered it medium well. Over 100 bottles of beer to choose from, though the menu is not as descriptive as it could be. 

Service: Our waitress was very friendly and very nice. She kept coming back to check on us and when we first sat down she asked if we were in for the first time and explained the menu to us. Kitchen service was quick. 

Location: Nice Detroit Ave location. This occupies the former 56 West (also burger) restaurant. There is free parking in the lot behind the restaurant and a back door to get into the place. 

Environment: If you had been to 56 West the environment will remind you of that very quickly. They haven't done any structural changes to the restaurant. There are some cool walls and lamps shades, but other than that it is a very basically furnished place. 

Overall Recommendation: It's not horrible by any means, but I wouldn't make a large detour for this place. Lakewood is full of burger places and this one rates low. It is too bad, because I first heard of this place at the Winter Ale Fest in downtown CLE. The chef was giving samples of a non-burger item which was amazing. There are some non burger items on the menu at the restaurant, but burgers are clearly what they - should - be known for."}
{"text":"This place is...average as can be. 

1) The menu is ridiculous.  Rather confusing. It's like trying to solve a puzzle.  

2) The food is pretty average. I ended up ordering some bacon-burger concoction (I guess they blend the bacon in with the burger meat).  

3) Overpriced as HELL. The food was good, but not THAT good. I won't be going back.  I can get a better quality burger for the same price with more food from Melt.  

Side note: I think it's pretty awesome that they get their buns from the bakery down the street."}
{"text":"BBB, Classic Bun added a touch of Michael Slyman to it, perfecto! This burger was amazing, I'm usually not too big on bacon, but it was a cheat day, never been happier to put bacon In my mouth. The slaw was a great touch on top. I normally do not lie when my burger is too big for me to bite it because it always falls apart, not this monstrosity, it held like Gorilla Glue and each bite was as tasty as the last. 

While I waited to be seated, I stood gazing at the beer cooler, they have a real nice selection and an option to build your own sixes, il have to do that some time. 

The interior decorator, whoevers brains were behind this creation deserves an applause because it is the coolest place to just look around while eating. The fixtures around the ights were super cool, I don't wanna call them lamp shades, but whatever they're called they had a comic book style theme to them. 

Food. Check
Beer Selection. Hella check!
Interior. Check

The parking lot SUCKS, it is probably the only thing negative I have tp say and it is not even their fault."}
{"text":"Great Burgers. Cheese curds aren't mozzarella sticks though. Fried pickles are great and so were the duck fries."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT experience here!  The service was fast and pleasant, the beer list is huge!, and the prices are very reasonable for how much food you get.  

I got the veggie burger \"palo alto style\" and it was amazing!  What's not to love about a goat cheese and avocado combo....YUM!  The veggie burgers are also homemade, which makes it even better!  My fiance also loved his streat burger \"farmhouse style\" with a fried egg/bacon/cheddar combo.  The fries were cooked to perfection - nice and crispy.

We were too full to enjoy dessert, so we ordered a sweet potato pie to-go.  The best part is that it's served in a mason jar, how convenient is that?!  Pure genius.  It was soooo delicious, I look forward to trying the other fun flavored \"streat treats!\"

Another unique feature is the craft beer 6 pack to-go!  This is something I've definitely never seen at another restaurant in Cleveland before.  Such a fun idea!

Well done Izzy, well done!!"}
