{"text":"This pizza is legit!  Great wood-fired crust is both chewy and crunchy, and you can smell the authenticity from the moment you walk in.  We ordered the Bianca which was a perfect balance of garlic and cheeses.  If size matters, the Grande does not disappoint.  Drinks include beer and wine only (for now) with bottled soda options.  Casual vibe.  Can't wait to make this a regular haunt!"}
{"text":"I think this grade is probably too low, but it honestly represents my first experience at DeSano's.  If we go back I'm confident it will go up.

The ambiance is not what I expected at all, very minimalist and open with wooden tables and long benches throughout and a stone floor. The focus is on the kitchen which is wide open and the two giant wood-burning ovens.  I really liked it.  It screamed - it's all about the food.  It gets a little loud since there is nothing to absorb the sound, but nothing too bad.

The bar was very limited in beers at the moment, only 3 on tap. Some wines as well.

The service was... interesting.  You order at the front and pay right away and they give you an electronic device to let you know when the pizza is ready.  Then they deliver the pizza to your  table.  It was not very crowded despite being a Saturday night when we came in.  We ordered and asked how long it would take and they told us 10 minutes or so.  So we went to the bar and got drinks and then sat down.  Ten minutes became fifteen became twenty, became twenty-five.  Finally one of the servers asked us what we had ordered because she noticed us sitting there for so long (again, it wasn't crowded).  It turns out that somehow they hadn't made our pizza.  They blamed the error on a new employee they were training. Whatever.

To their credit they brought us out some meatballs, tomato sauce and bread to snack on which was very welcome because we were quite hungry at that point.  Unfortunately, they rushed our pizza.  We ordered a Napoletana pizza with broccoli rabe, mozzarella de bufala and sausage.  But it came out undercooked, white across the bottom rather than charred.  The pizza itself was good (although I wish I had realized that it was the only pizza on the menu without tomato sauce! that one's on me) and the quality of the ingredients was apparent.  I love the sweet/salty sausage contrasted with the bitterness of the broccoli rabe.  However, undercooking and rushing the pizza out really compounded their initial mistake of not putting in our order.

Overall I would recommend DeSano's as it offers a quality of pizza that is difficult to find in Charlotte, even though my own personal experience was rather lackluster."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte for 13 years & I eat my meals out frequently.....

DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana has been on my radar screen since I noticed it coming out of the ground during it's recent new construction.

Beautiful building & HUGE on the inside! Ordering at the register deletes waiting on drinks & any possibility of waiting on a server if the place gets slammed. You'd just hit the large satellite bar and do your own thing. A refreshing concept.

Their wood-fired pizza boasts a unique, slighty-charred crust that has a deeply authentic Italian appearance & taste. I ordered the San Gennaro on Philip's (The hysterical bartender brand-new to Charlotte - straight from Honolulu, HI) recommendation. It was UNREAL!!! It was built like a Sherman tank with San Marzano tomato sauce, sausage, peppadews, garlic, caramelized onions, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala & pecorino romano!  Right?!?!?!?!

They have yet to have their official Grand Opening, I believe Philip said it was coming later this month.  

This place is priced right, has PLENTY of space, and also the availability to sit outside & enjoy your meal.

I'd like to thank Philip & Abi for being awesome as well as accommodating this afternoon! I promise I will absolutely be back to eat & visit!!! Many thanks!!!! I wish you both continued success here in the Queen City!!!

{"text":"Amazing pizza, great atmosphere, and excellent customer service! Will be back the next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great pizza with quality ingredients. Lots of seating, including covered outdoor patio. Came for lunch, but they have a bar and TVs that would make for a good night time atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and before I hit the front door I knew it was going to be good. The smells drom this place are incredible and the pie is even better.

I had the San Gennero and it was great! The small is enough for two and the flavors were perfect.

The atmosphere is really well done. Great place for a bite at lunch or for dinner before a night on the town.

Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town.  Great atmosphere.  Fresh ingredients.  Never been disappointed. I love the customer service also."}
{"text":"Huge pizza place in Cherry neighborhood.   Two wood burning ovens cranking out pizzas.  Very basic, but good pizzas. I look forward to trying some different combinations."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! Was in Charlotte from out of town and stopped in for a late lunch...price was super reasonable for authentic pizza. One of the owners happened to be in the restaurant and had a short conversation - they fly their ingredients in every Tuesday from Naples, Italy so it is FRESH! 

Good people and Good Pizza"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!!.  charlotte:  embrace the place or it's not going to make it.  Perfect crust, great sauce."}
{"text":"Amazing! We are so happy this place is open and so close by! The pizza is next level. For our first visit we had the Pizza Bianca and the San Gennaro... both were so so good. 

We'll most definitely be back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Charlotte (replacing Inizio).  Desanos follows VPN guidelines.  If you know what that means, then you know they are legit."}
{"text":"We went here about a week after they opened. The general impression was that it was a large casual space but service and food killed the experience.  
You order, find a place to sit and wait for food. 
The ordering process was relatively slow and inflexible. I wanted to move mushroom from one pizza to the other since one of us did not like it. That was $3 extra. Not even just give me the mushrooms that come with it rather than putting on the pizza. 
We paid close to $40 for two small pizza and two Softdrinks which I think as quite high price given that Tavel service is available at many Pizza place for less. 
After all this we had high expectations from the pizza itself but were very disappointed. It looked ok but tasted more like cardboard. 
There just too many great pizza places in the vicinity for this to be a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Was concerned this place may not be good as we went on a Saturday afternoon and it was empty. To my surprise it was very good. Love how the pizza is served on sheet trays, it eliminates extra plates that are wasted or need to be washed."}
{"text":"A little disappointed.  I was expecting more.  
Ambiance: 5  Food: 3  Value: 3

Ambiance/vibe is great.  Huge open space with communal seating, open kitchen, garage doors open to patio.  Great space to hang out. 

You order at a counter like a fast casual place and they bring your food to the table.  Massive wood burning ovens behind the counter. 

I had the spinach salad which was average. The spinach is spread out on a small metal tray on a piece of paper.  Odd, not practical and unappealing.  Hard to mix and get dressing on your greens.  How hard would it be to serve a salad in a bowl?

Pizza is round but comes out on a rectangular metal tray.  No plates, roll of paper towels on table. My friend ordered a large pizza so he could take home leftovers.  The tray took over the whole table.  

Pizza crust was great with very fresh ingredients.  Taste however was extremely bland.  I had Pomodorini which said it had garlic but had no seasoning.  Same for my friend's Marinara.  

Value is poor.  Small marinara pizza was $10 and spinach salad was $7.  You can go to a real restaurant like WP Kitchen or Pizza Omaggio and get something similar price with better taste, actual plates and service.  I'd give it another try maybe since I like the ambiance."}
{"text":"Had the pizzeria to myself this afternoon at 4pm.  Ordered the margarita and added pepperoni and meatballs.  Had a bottled water and an IPA on tap while watching girls gators softball.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. The place had a good vibe, though all alone.  My litmus test.....would I go there to eat again?   YES!   Pizza was excellent, as was the beer.  Their friendliness gets a big thumbs up too.   Would love to see a weekend crowd.  Their sauce was excellent, crust perfect, and service very good!   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and got a small 2-topping pizza. With tip it was over $20. Was the pizza good? Yeah. Do I feel I got value for my money? Not especially."}
{"text":"Awesome simple industrial decor. Tall tables and short tables with plenty of seating. I like the idea of being able to choose indoor or outdoor depending on the day.   Food is outstanding and very helpful staff. Lots of pizzas types to choose from.  Freash ingredients and unique combinations. The only thing I found odd was plastic forks and knives. Very hard to eat pizza with a plastic forks. Very new place. If they keep this up they will have many happy years to go."}
{"text":"Yo, their pizza is slamming...and I don't even like pizza. 

They have authentic stone fire pizza ovens, cool open decor, and their Calabrian Peppers!? Baybeh! Those peppers tho. Oh and I love their covered patio area which is open to the restaurant and next to the sidewalk. Here's what I ordered:

Capricciosa- I ordered this with no prosciutto because, no pork on my fork, and added the Calabrian Peppers. So darn tasty and fresh! Each pie is made to order and they use super authentic, quality ingredients.

Calzone-my brother ordered this and neither of us offered the other to sample taste. We're siblings, it's totally cool to be greedy (^-^)/. His calzone has the exact same ingredients as my pizza, only it was all inside. The portion size was awesome.

The GM, Liz, was super attentive and checked on us during our meal to make sure we were enjoying our experience. I appreciated that. 

I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Loved it. So gooooddddd! We had the San Gennaro pizza and the meatballs. The dough is perfect and the sauce is very good!"}
{"text":"Well, my first visit here didn't start off well.  I looked at the menu and decided on a pizza but when I asked the cashier about a local beer on tap she was quick to say she didn't know anything about beer- \"I'm not a beer drinker\" she said.  Okay.  Then when my friend asked if a particular white wine was dry the same cashier proclaimed she wasn't sure about the wine - \"I'm not a wine drinker\" she said.  

I'm sort of accustom to better service.  Aren't the wait staff suppose to know the food and beverage menu? Apparently not at DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana.  As for the pizza, it was average. Nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Great pizza and environment. You can sit inside, outside with roof or outside in the sun."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for this review, but it really was an average experience so I'm going with 3.

We'd been out all afternoon and were ready to take on a lot of pizza, so we ordered two - one lasagna and one with a bunch of veggies. We asked if the meat could be put on just half of the pizza to accommodate the vegetarian (me) - they said no. Why? They make the pizzas as they're ordered, so why can't they put the meat on just half of the pizza? This is one thing I'll never understand. The man taking our order was not being flexible so we let it go. 

About 10 minutes later, I had my pizza. They brought out the second pizza a few minutes after that, only it was the wrong pizza. So, we had to wait another 10 minutes for the second correct pizza to come out. The pizza was good, but I've had better in Charlotte. Not sure I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza with light red sauce. - Amazing! Loved it!!!!

Water- good! They also have cups & free water. 


I'm so excited to try more!!!!

They also have a Beer wine bar!!"}
{"text":"I love the special star crust with ricotta stuffing. Great flavor, great crust. Only problem is the price. For the ambience (warehousey with picnic tables and no service), i just don't get this price point for pizzas. I still love all the neopolitan pizzerias and will probably still occasionally frequent, but it's not a deal."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. I definitely think its better then Inzio. The crust is fantastic. Its not soggy  and overly oily like what I have had at Inzio. Doesnt have the quality of ingredients that Alino's has. I can taste the passion at Alino's. Will definitely be back to this spot though. By far the best pizza in the area. Its a lot more conveniently located to me.

The Atmosphere is awesome. I love community tables and the openess of the dining room. The patio was wonderful. On a 90+ degree day, I was completely comfortable."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE! Phil, the bartender is great and so is Jeff, the manager. Wonderful customer service! Food is delicious. Spacious indoor and outdoor seating (Patio is dog friendly). Great drinks (beer, wine or liquor)! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the grand opening and loved every single thing about Desano's! I've been to the location in Nashville & fell in love with their pizza so I couldn't wait for them to come to Charlotte!! Can't go wrong with the Margarita or Bianca and how cool is the layout of the restaurant! Amazing place can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"finally had a chance to check this place out.   I read a lot about this pizza chain and was excited to see more neopolitian pizza come to charlotte.   Ambiance was nice but the pizza was jut ok.   Crust and the sauce were average to me.  I don't mind paying a premium for this type of pizza but it needs to be right.   I will try again."}
{"text":"I am a bit conflicted writing this review. 

First VPN pizza is a different experience than New York or Chicago style.that is representing the oldest and most famous Neapolitan pizzerias. 

I always start with my baseline pie, the Margherita, this is VPN pizza simplicity which allows the purest and freshest ingredients to shine. In addition, the dough and sauce are really the  stars here and everything should just compliment them. 

DeSano;s  Margherita D.O.P.: San Marzano tomato sauce, basil, garlic, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, pecorino romano
   The Crust: thickest firmest crust of any Neapolitan style pizza that I ever had
   The sauce: the lightest and driest of any Neapolitan style pizza that I ever had
   The taste was good however it the experience was more like VPN Flatbread and not pizza

Bianca: Garlic, mozzarella di bufala, scamorza, ricotta, pecorino romano
   The same as above

DeSano: San Marzano tomato sauce, sausage, pepperoni, garlic, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, pecorino romano
      The same as above but the saltiness of the meat made it even better

Last note:6 of arrived 20 minutes to closing on a Sunday with no one else in the restaurant. While the staff was prepped the place was cleaned and ready for closing. However, the staff was friendly and accommodating. 

Bottom-Line: While this place can boast a friendly staff and good food however this isn't my favorite interpretation of VPN pizza making and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Very casual. No wait service. Good pizza. Midtown by Bojangles. Looks like a cool patio - no furniture yet."}
{"text":"Great pizza and bar selection. I've been too the location in Nashville and this one is waaayyy better! Charlotte will love this!"}
{"text":"I really just don't understand...

1. they don't offer gluten free pizza...which is FINE. but then.
2. I was going to order a salad and then 
3. they don't even have protein to add salad.

so basically if you have any food allergy, they don't, and actually can't accommodate. was a hard pass. didn't even stay."}
{"text":"This is a solid place to go for some pizza. It is a laid back atmosphere and you order at the counter then wait for your food to be delivered. There is a separate bar for draft beer and wine. The caprese was delicious and fresh. It's easily enough for 3 people. The desano pizza was absolutely delicious. The crust was the best part. They have fresh cheese as a condiment to sprinkle on top. I will be back and Highly recommend this place for anyone- families or those without kids."}
{"text":"I really wanted to be able to give this place 5 stars after reading all the reviews but I just cant. The pizza here is above average but it's not amazing, which is unfortunate because it's priced like it should be amazing. When you are charging $22-24 for a single very thin 16\" crust pizza (we had a De Sano) it ought to be amazing. We also had a spinach salad; it too was good but overpriced. On top of that they have the gall to ask for 15%+ tip BEFORE you eat and its really closer to a panera level of service; also like someone pointed out, you don't even get plates, you're eating on paper towels! :( They bring out your pizza when its cooked and that's about it. 15% for that? Our pie was a little under-baked and the ingredients were just ordinary. Don't get me wrong; this is a decent pizza place with friendly service (and they do serve their pizza FAST!), just not worth the high prices they are asking."}
{"text":"Not good, but GREAT pizza.  I would agree with other reviews in that the set up and customer experience is awkward.  We prefer takeout."}
{"text":"Simple and to the point. This type of pizza shouldn't be fussed with and over done and at DeSano's it's not. We've been here twice and will be back again. We've stuck with the traditional margherita and couldn't be more pleased. The flavor of the sauce is balanced with the cheese and garlic. The undertone of garlic on this pie can't be beat. The crust was perfect both times being thin yet stable for a clean bite. They could do a little something with the basil since it's just placed in the middle; it looks good but the flavor isn't everywhere. 

We've also tried the meatballs which were awesome and homemade. And the spinach salad. The topping work well and the portion is enough for two or as a meal itself. The metal tray is a bit weird but goes with the theme. 

The space itself has a great patio and a portion is heated for the winter. Big tables for groups with high tops and standard height makes for a family atmosphere along with a happy hour jive. Beer is on tap, you can pay at the front or over at the bar. 

A great spot with decent parking. Make it a priority to try this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good but not much better than blaze and it costs A LOT more. Talking $12 for a plain small pizza.

If yo are a true Italian pizza aficionado the id say this is your spot. Other than that, stick to Blaze."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. The crust is authentic and the toppings are good. The service was great. I was surprised that all of the exterior lights were turned off 15-20 before closing and it made the parking lot eerily dark. I mean, there's no other outside parking lot lighting and it creeped me out as I headed to the car. Owners may want to consider a couple of post lights. Overall, the experience was good. I'll be back...in the daylight."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly staff!  For anyone who has been to Antico in Atlanta, this is very similar!  Great ingredients, interesting pizzas and a great vibe. Excited to go back!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Charlotte. If you have not tried this place you have to GO. Staff and owners are incredibly nice and helpful. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"On a rainy night, I stopped in for dinner/takeout.  Surprisingly, the restaurant was empty, so I was able to quickly place my order of the San Gennaro pizza.  It's one of the more popular options and I definitely understand why.  It has sausage, peppers, garlic, and caramelized onions and is absolutely delish!  It was made fresh and was done in no time.  If you're looking for amazing pizza, made fresh to order, and super quick service this spot is for you."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Went for pizza but found the absolute best Bloody Mary ever. House made mix is smoky slightly sweet and FRESH. A must try! The pizza and calzone made with high quality ingredients were melt in your mouth. When I had questions about certain types of peppers and ingredients on menu the girl at counter generously offered to let me taste a bite to help me choose which pizza. Great staff and GREAT food and drink!"}
{"text":"I think kids can make their own pizza... shoo maybe adults too? My friend and I met for lunch here and it was pretty empty for lunch. Great! No wait! As I was walking in I noticed someone from the kitchen helping kids shape some pizza dough at a table with some plastic cups. 

Like Nikki said it's a nice joint with the industrial vibe. It's cool out on the patio area and very wide open. You can see the people making your food. Nice people watching spot... you know for if people walk by. 

I like that the menu is short. I don't like a billion options and it's good to see a restaurant specialize in few dishes.

Of course I had to get the popular pizza San Gennaro and it was really good. Pretty much the same as Inizio. Similar style and flavors, salty with a little hint of sweetness, uncomplicated pizza sauce, crusty thin bread. Their pizzas don't automatically come with a cup of pizza sauce but you can ask and they'll give you some for free. I like the pizza sauce for my crust. 

Nice spot to hang and enjoy some light pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Cool place. Menu is a little confusing and could be improved. 
I was surprised at how few people were at this place on a Saturday night. It was practically empty. But regardless, good pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was great.  I really like how the parmesan crisps up and gets a little crunchy.  We has the DeSano pizza which is basically a fancy pepperoni and sausage.  I would have given 5 starts but I have a pet peeve about 15%, 20%, and 25% tipping options on the checkout tablet at a counter where I place my order and fill my own drink.  I am happy to tip a waiter/waitress for good service.  I think its ridiculous to tip a guy at a cash register the same way."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of desano since I lived in Charleston a few years ago and frequented that (now closed) location. The pizza here is food, the crust is crisp and flavorful. We ordered the Bianca and margherita pizza with pepperoni. Both were very good. They have a condiment stand where you can mix olive oil with garlic, oregano etc. tips for management: add signage so people know where to order, have menus available at the entrance rather than the cash register and have the utensils facing DOWN in the caddy rather than up so everyone isn't touching them."}
{"text":"It's a Sunday and running errands between NC and SC. We missed brunch time, so what's a girl to do. Definitely not ready for dinner nor a heavy meal. Something that would definitely hit the spot and last till dinner in a couple of hours. It's Pizza Time!!!

My friend took me over to DeSano and had been here numerous times. 

Looks can be deceiving. From the outside, looks like a restaurant as you open the doors and walk in... Feels like a brewery with picnic tables spread all over the establishment.  Very casual dining for the whole family. It's like just come as you are. No dress code.

As you walk in, menus are on the counter. Friendly staff ready to take your order as well as answer any of your questions. It's like pizza heaven here. Seeing two ovens right in front of you. Everything is made fresh and all the ingredients are from Italy. All these items are available for purchase so you can make your own pizza. Way cool. 

What I like is the size of the pizza you can order. Two sizes to select from. For two people we got the small and more than enough to share. 

After placing order, we sat down to take in the place. Wow! huge ceilings wonder if this was a textile factory or warehouse for it is so big and spacious. There is a patio and a bar area. Bar is open and staff asks if you like anything. Big Screen TV and Food Show is on for your entertainment.

Staff bought our pizza in a tray all cut up. After we finished, we were looking for garbage bin to throw out used particles. Staff noted just leave trays on table and they will pick up. How cool is that.

Place was not busy for it was after Brunch. So it was fun to hang out and talk to the staff about DeSano and how they make their Neapolitan Pizza.
Love Old World-Style Pizza."}
{"text":"Yummmm! The staff was super nice, the place was very clean and my pizza was delicious! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Don't think twice, come here. The pizza is some of the best you'll find period . I will 100% visit this spot every time I come to charlotte ."}
{"text":"If you like brick oven pizza this place is the best! Pizza comes out fast too! Def one of my favorites!!"}
{"text":"Went during their soft opening. Delicious food and beautiful restaurant. They have weekly shipments of ingredients from Italy. Thin pizza that was amazing.

The ordering and having food delivered to your table process is sort of awkward but I attribute that to the soft opening and getting the kinks out of their system.

Sat at the bar and the bartender was super nice and attentive . I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and hospitable service. Great fresh pizzas made to order with simple and quality ingredients. It's great to see the pizzas being made and thrown into the large ovens. The space is large with long tables perfect for groups. Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim on a Friday evening when we were craving pizza, and am I glad we did.  The pizza was amazing, and the atmosphere is really fun. The specialized pizzas can't have substitutions but you can build your own. 

Update - we've now come back for a second consecutive Pizza Friday. Last week we tried the Desano, which was spectacular. This week we are trying the Lasagna Pizza (pictured below). My wife couldn't wait for me to get the picture before she dove in. I think it might be even better!  Every ingredient is fresh and flavorful. We've definitely found our pizza place in Charlotte, and we are on the fast track to becoming regulars!"}
{"text":"Theeeeeeeeeeeee best!!!  obsessed!  Hands down the best pizza.  The atmosphere, the people, and the patio were more than 5 stars!  The whole experience was memorable!  Thank you DeSanos."}
{"text":"I've only tried the most basic one ( a Margherita D.O.P. I think) but I found nothing to critique, it was very very good. I'll be back.
Not crazy about the decor though."}
{"text":"For Neapolitan pizza enthusiasts like myself, you will be glad to know there is another high quality authentic Italian pizza maker in town besides Inizio's, which as of right now is all the way in Indian trails. Went with some friends and tried a few of the different flavors they offer, but as a purist I can't help but laud their  Margherita D.O.P. The crust is crunchy and soft, the sauce is scarce yet pure, and the basil garnish makes for a pretty pizza and a clean, pure taste. 

I echo what has been previously said of the comparison to Antico's in Atlanta. Definitely the same causal feel, although they don't have byob, plenty of drink options, and more to come from what I'm told. Great place to come with a group of friends or family. They even brought out some pizza dough for the kids at the table next to mine to play with. Was definitely a nice touch. 

Although I came during their soft opening period, I am confident that Desano's will only get better with time, and solidify itself as a Charlotte staple for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Move over Inizio Pizza Napoletana, DeSano does Neapolitan pizza WAY better. The pizza isn't soggy and the crust is actually browned and, where it should be, crispy. They've got some really tasty pizza selections in two different sizes -- both shareable -- that range between $10-23. Their ingredients are flown in weekly from Napoli and Campania. Friendly staff and very clean inside.

As soon as you walk into this restaurant in midtown, all 5,000 sq ft of it, you see the grand authentic wildfire pizza ovens (they are a part of the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, which preserves the centuries old craft of authentic Neapolitan pizza), stacks of wood, and bags of flour, with the smell of freshly cooked pizza wafting through the communal-style seating room, bar, and patio. Pizza is delivered to your seat so you can sit back and relax, and even watch sports on the many large screen tv's they have. 

Their menu items exceed pizza, including meatballs, calzones, salads, and desserts like gelato, Nutella pizza, biscottis, and cannolis. 

They have other locations in places, like Nashville and Charleston to name a few."}
{"text":"DeSano's is legit Napoletano pizza. They follow the strict standards set in Italy to be called \"Napoletano\" and import most of their ingredients from Italy. During my visit they were out of oregano at the little bar they have where the cheese and other additions are. I asked for more oregano, thinking they'd bring out some plastic container an refill the dish. NO! The pizza maker went over and grabbed a drying bag with actual oregano on the stalk. He crushed it up in the bag to get the dried oregano off the stalk. Then he put it in the serving dish and brought it over. The smell was so strong and the flavor of it was amazing. I told him if I got pulled over with the pizza in the car that I could really tell the cop \"it's not pot, it's just oregano!!\" Lol The bar with the plastic cups makes it easy to get as much parmesan cheese, fresh oregano, fresh garlic, Mediterranean sea salt, and black pepper you want without having to keep asking the workers for more. They also have to-go boxes on a shelf so you can pack your leftovers (if you have any). It's not chain pizza prices, but you get what you pay for at this place.

Saving alert: If you shop at Harris Teeter there's a $5 off coupon on the back of the receipt (at the Myers Park location for sure) for DeSano's so you can give it a try at a discount."}
{"text":"DELISH!!!  I came for lunch and can't wait to come
back at night and sit by the fire with a glass of wine. The place is fabulous-great atmosphere and delicious pizza and salad!  It's a must-go!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was average. Definitely not worth the price. I would only come back for the beer."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best pizza I've had in awhile and I was recently in New Jersey.  These guys seem like they know how to make a good pie. The crust was just the right thickness and slightly chewy, light sauce and cheese and quality toppings.  Filling but not too heavy at all. I had room for the cannoli and glad I did, it was Definitely fresh! Thanks for a great pizza experience! It's nice to have a local place close by."}
{"text":"We've been to DeSano 3 or 4 times now.  I REALLY like the pizza, it feels authentic, and it's a good change of pace from the other pizza joints around Charlotte.  Last night was the first time we've gotten takeout, however, and will probably be the last.  We ordered two pizzas, a Bianca, and a D.O.P. The D.O.P. with sausage and peppadews was fine, but the Bianca was basically just toasted bread.  I've had this pizza before and it was good, so I am not sure what happened. It's like they tossed the dough, added chopped garlic, and forgot the cheese and everything else... NOT good.  I suppose that is the problem with takeout, you don't know until you get home and try it.  I was very disappointed last night, because at $45 for 2 pizzas before tip, I expected something pretty good, and this was not.  Rating 3 stars instead of 1 because like I said, I've been here before, and it has been good, this is just a consistency issue."}
{"text":"I have to say I came here on a whim... it was close to my new office and I decided to give it a try. I'm not a super big fan of pizza in general, but I have to say DeSano's does it right. Simple Neapolitan pizza with good ingredients and a great wood fire oven - Can't get better than that!

The space has enough seats to fill a stadium, I haven't seen it full. Service is great and friendly. My hack here is getting the pepper oil... it's legit... I dip my crust and it's a nice balance between spicy and doughy. 

My one beef with this place, they only have two sizes... the small one is too much for one person and the large one is not large enough. Other than that, this place is gold."}
{"text":"I definitely understand what the hype is about when it comes to DeSano Pizzeria. I went here because I was craving pizza. I really didn't want to take the easy way out and order a standard pizza that could be delivered in 30min or less. I wanted more. I wanted something special. So I hopped in the car and decided to try a new place. 

When you walk in, the space is huge and filled with community tables and high ceilings. Behind the register, you can see the employees stretching pizza dough and making the pizza to order from scratch. Doesn't get much fresher than that! To give you an idea of timing, no one was in front of me and it too about ten minutes to get my order. Not too bad! You can also order a glass of time or a beer while you wait.

I ended up with the DeSano pizza, which was a meat lovers dream. There were also these amazing red peppers on top that I have no idea what they were, but they were really unique. All of the ingredients are the real Italian deal...from the tomatoes to the meats (you can tell they don't use the cheap stuff). I also got a side of meatballs. Delicioso!

Great place to go for a casual dinner and an individual pizza. You can make your own, but I recommend trying one of their creations."}
{"text":"Where to begin? In the words of General Manager Jessie \"Desano is not just a pizza place, it's a pizza experience\" and he is absolutely right. In my opinion one of the coolest pizza experiences yet!

Fun fact: Desano's ingredients are flown in from Campania and Napoli every week. Say what? Yes! You can't get anymore Italian than that {unless you actually pack up and go to Italy (don't leave without me though).

Guess what! Every single pizza is cooked in wood-burning ovens (the picture captured to above) only for 90 seconds. So not only are our ingredients flown in from Italy-VIP status, but our pizza masterpieces aren't created until we arrive. Desano also offers a variety of other delish items on their menu such as; Sandwiches, Salads, Calzones, Gelato, Cannolis and more.

I went for the Margherita D.O.P. (not sure what the D.O.P. stands for, probably should've asked lol) it was crafted with San Marzano tomato sauce, basil, garlic, scamorza, mozzarella di bufala, and pecorino romano. As I'm sitting on the patio, enjoying the beautiful view, the General Manager Jessie came and sat down with me. Although our conversation was brief you would've thought we'd known each other for years-talk about top notch customer service!"}
{"text":"Going tree stars on this one and I'm kinda sad about it. There is so much potential but the absolutely must switch out their cheese. I got the classic margarita pizza and it came out yellow and dripping with grease. I mean it looked like they poured butter all over it. I had to use like 6 paper towels to cut some of the grease. The dough was cooked to perfection and the sauce was pretty tasty. I wish they would have gone for more classic style of margarita with the chunks of mozzarella but they did some sort of combo with the cheese and it just didn't add up. They should also slice the basil up and put it all over the pizza and not just three leaves. 

I think I'll give some other places a shot before I return."}
{"text":"Great open restaurant w/ plenty of seating and awesome patio. Capese salad for two was fresh & delicious. Pizza crust was wonderful. Pizza sauce could use some help- lacks flavor. Excited for the growth of neopolitan pizza in Charlotte and looking forward to trying this place again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizzas! The lasagna is my favorite so far. I can't wait to go back and try the rest! Cute place and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Lazy Sunday afternoon,let's have a wood fired pizza. 90 seconds at 900 F will certainly do the trick. Tasty and the pizza base was excellent and clearly made from good flour with love. Yep we ate the whole thing and didn't feel overwhelmed . That's a good thing. We washed it down with a Peroni beer, great glass and chilled well. $12 for a couple beers and a tip seems a little step to be honest. Overall good,we'll be back for take out."}
{"text":"So happy to see this place come to Charlotte.  When traveling to Nashville I found this place and was amazed with their pizza.  Glad they expanded here, will be there frequently!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in Charlotte.  Quality of ingredients.  Everything is great but the San Gennero is our favorite so far."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check this place out since it opened and it did not disappoint! From the outside it looks like it would be on the upside of casual due to the gorgeous brickwork and covered patio, but it's actually really casual... as in mass quantities of ingredients stacked around and pizza served on baking trays... but it's all good cause the pizza is great!

I asked for a vegetarian recommendation and they said the Vedura was definitely the best. They weren't wrong... although I will have to go and and try all the others just to be sure ;) . It had broccoli rabe, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, pesto, and buffalo mozzarella of course! Crust was Napoli style and nice and bready with a slight crispy char. 

Great for any night of the week!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We went on a Monday during lunch hour and had our pizza in less that 10 minutes. The staff was very accommodating. While the prices were a bit high, I would gladly pay it again for such tasty pizza. This is the closest I've been able to get actual Italian pizza since returning to the states. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Pizza good but  not quite great... Grande Napoletana... a bit too much cheese but it was very good cheese!

I tried in later afternoon so empty- it's a very large open space and loud music was playing. It must get wicked \"lively\" when it fills up.

You order on line - not my fav!  Prices do not reflect self-service.

I saw just 2 salads - one with spinach, artichokes, parm, onion, raw mushrooms, and CRANBERRIES! So 80's. The spinach tasted like it had been sitting in a big plastic bag for too long. Certainly not local organic greens!  Vinaigrette a bit sweet. 7 bucks. 

The other salad was a caprese for 2. I  find a caprese with pizza to be redundant. Vinaigrette a bit sweet.

Now. Are sitting down? There is no brewed iced tea! Erggggg. Isn't that illegal in North Carolina?

Drinks are in coolers - more self service. I had to get a cup of ice at bar. 

Tables are wood... picnic style with backless benches. Some are high version.

People were very nice. 

Since you pay after ordering, you are given those beloved tip options - 15, 18% etc. Since you have not tried the food, nor been served, timing is off. 

I have always dreamt of eating pizza in Naples. Trip is still on."}
{"text":"Charlotte has always been a great pizza town, but the recent arrival of DeSano's, a traditional Sicilian pizzeria with Southern California roots, moves us to an entirely new level. This isn't just pizza -- it's a masterpiece of culinary art. Start with an order of the fantastic meatballs, then order a couple pies for the table and dive in. I love the San Gennaro and the spicy Diavola, but the signature DeSano pie, with sausage, pepperoni, and romano, leaves every other pizza in the dust. The crust is light and flavorful, and the toppings are as fresh as they come. Absolutely mind blowing.

The restaurant has a great selection of red and white wine, along with a small but impressive selection of local brews on tap. There's tons of seating inside and on the covered patio, and service is friendly and prompt. On my first visit, I mentioned to the owner, Scott DeSano, how the place reminded me of Antico, the classic Atlanta pizzeria that quickly became a shrine for great Neapolitan pies. \"I just bought it,\" he said with a smile. And all of a sudden, I knew I had found my new favorite pizza place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to grab a bite near the hospital and stumbled upon this new gem. I had the San Gennaro pizza and it was delicious!  It was enough for 2 people or just me with leftovers. Slightly sweet and a little spicy with the peppadews (sweet red peppers), caramelized onions, and sausage, but super tasty. I ate and the bar and was thoroughly entertained by the bartender, Philip. Cool decor and it looks like the outdoor patio will be a nice place to eat in the fall and winter with the wood fireplace."}
{"text":"The pizza is out of this world---crust is everything. Love the vibe, great for a date night or family dinner. The manager Ali is awesome, came up and checked on how everything was and gifted us with cannolis for my birthday. Will definitely be back and recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other \"average' ratings here on YELP regarding DeSano. I was expecting pizza similar to what I experienced in my travels to Portofino/Naples last year. Nope.

I was not overly impressed with this place. The staff was very friendly and helpful but the pizza quality was \"average'. The crust was very good, the sauce needed more flavor and the cheese was NOT the highest quality.

This place is definitely better than Papa John's, Pizza Hut, and Dominos...but I dare not rate it a \"5\".
."}
{"text":"The pizza at Desano is some of the best in Charlotte.  Hands down.  They ship in their flour from Europe weekly and that quality is obvious in the final product.  They have a full bar, a great patio and the atmosphere is super kid-friendly.  They also have a nice-sized parking lot which is rare in this area.  This place is a little tucked away, but don't miss out on it!

P.S. Get the Nutella Dessert Pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!  We were heading to a show in uptown and needed a quick and easy spot for dinner.  I was surprised when I walked in to DeSanos!  The space is beautiful and huge!  Lots of tables, some communal.  A separate bar area from where you order pizza.  Indoor and outdoor wood burning fireplaces.  The place was so clean and nice.  Our pizza was at our table in less than ten minutes.  Perfect!  Most impressive was the staff!  Very attentive!  They even offered to move a table next to the fireplace if I wanted to sit there!  Great place for large groups to gather! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"DeSano Pizzeria is tucked behind a Walgreens in midtown Charlotte.  The first thing you notice upon walking into the place is the massive amount of wood stacked in every window.  I'm not sure if that is just for show and the wood they use for the ovens is stored elsewhere, but I thought it gave the place a neat rustic vibe, especially with all the dark wood in the interior and long, wide picnic-style tables.

I was in the mood for pizza now and pizza later, so I went with the San Gennaro pizza in the larger size of two options.  It has a San Marzano tomato sauce base, sausage, peppadews, garlic, caramelized onions, scamorza, buffalo mozzarella, and pecorino romano.

First, a minor gripe: when we got there, no one was in line.  We decided what we wanted and then proceeded to stand in front of the register area while employees casually walked right by us, making eye contact and paying no heed.  I'm not asking for immediate service or anyone to drop what they're doing to help us, but we stood there for several minutes before someone finally came over to take our order.  I know they're busy, but they weren't THAT busy where we should have been ignored for as long as we were.

Anyway, onto the pizza.  It came out in a reasonable amount of time, which allowed me to drain a Hop, Drop & Roll which is one of my favorite local brews that is available in a lot of area restaurants.  The fact they have a full (albeit somewhat spartan) bar surprised and impressed me.  I stuck with beer this time, but I could definitely see myself going there for a cocktail and some pizza some time.

The pizzas are cooked in a wood-burning oven and it shows.  There was some decent leopard spotting on the underside of the pizza, and there were a couple peppadews that had begun to char a little bit.  The menu warns people not familiar with this style of pizza that charring is normal and inevitable, but to be honest, I would have been okay with my pizza being even a little more charred as I love the toasty note it brings to the table.

As a whole, the pizza is an absolute winner.  The combination of the fatty sausage with the sweet/spicy peppadews and the rich, fatty cheese was the perfect combination.  I didn't really pick up any of the garlic that was supposedly on the pizza, but it wasn't really missed.  The only faults I could find with the pizza were that I think the dough could use just a touch more salt, and the sausage could use more (or...any?  I couldn't detect it at all) fennel seed, though that's just a personal preference of sausage of mine.  I ate half my pizza in the restaurant and the other half a couple hours later, so in any case it didn't last long.

Service at this fast-casual style restaurant was fine, the bartender was pleasant and efficient, I liked the decor, and the product they serve is delicious.  I'd come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent so is the service. Philip at the bar was very friendly and helpful, top notch customer service is what you get when you visit Desano and have Philip serve you."}
{"text":"YES! YES! YES!

We stopped here after an event.  We had had enough appetizers and desserts and wanted REAL FOOD.  This place was perfect!  They literally make your pizza while you're ordering and it's in the brick fired oven before you've sat down.  The ingredients are fresh and they have a great selection of toppings.  We ordered meatballs while we waited for our pizza.  They were brought to the table almost immediately...delicious.  Our pizzas were baked to perfection. There was nothing left after our party of six demolished 3 giant sized pizzas.  

Try this place.  It's AMAZING."}
{"text":"Average at best. We stopped in on a Friday afternoon and the place was empty. We counted 8 employees with several doing nothing but looking at their phones. No one was particularly interested in waiting on us. We ordered our food, a pizza and a Stromboli with a drink each coming to close to $30. Neither one of us was impressed with our food. The stacks of wood throughout the restaurant make me wonder what kind of bugs are happy to now have moved indoors."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try DeSano for a while and wish we hadn't waited so long! The service is prompt and pizza comes out quickly. Great mix of indoor and outdoor seating as well as a hybrid of the two (open air with roof covering). The pizza was delicious - thin crust with amble scrumptious toppings. Cannot wait for cooler temperatures to enjoy tasty pizza, draft beer, and football on the patio. Will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I heard someone complaining the other day about how we have too much pizza in this town. I wanted to say to him, \"we have nothing in common, go away.\" There's no such thing as too much pizza. #amiright

It's great to see Neapolitan type places popping up in the Charlotte area now. Desano has a handful of locations across the country. The space is pretty cool. Good sized, industrial chic with communal tables. Fantastic patio, garage doors. The kitchen is wide open. You order at the register and they bring your food out to you. 

Our order: the San Gennaro (cashier told me it was their most popular), Lasagna, and Capricciosa. The San Gennaro was the winner for me. I'm a sucker for a anything with peppadews. The Cappricciosa was also delicious. Loved the artichokes and mushrooms. It was all good. They have a condiment-type stand where you'll find add-ons like parmesan and what not to sprinkle on top of your pie. My small pizza with tax ended up being almost $17. 

There is a full service bar. The bottle wine selection was decent, but the \"by the glass\" selection only had a few options. We tried to order beers at the register with our pizza (we could see them in the cooler behind her), but she said we had to go to the bar. Think there was some confusion there about that. 

Desano is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow.. killer pies. One of (if not the best) in CLT for a true Napoletana- style pizza. Excellent sauce, all Uber- fresh ingredients and flavors that really pop. Great buildout (think exposed beams, long wooden tables and big, airy feel. Def worth a look especially if you are a northeast ex pat looking for \"real\" pizza here in the Queen City."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with desano no matter what location you are at. Pizza is always piping hot and ingredients extremely fresh. Love a place where they have balsamic and olive oil to spread over your pizza. The desano pizza always does the trick. And you can count on your pizza coming out of the oven not long after you order."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Delicious pizza! Awesome party venue. This place is seriously the best. I was in a bind for my 3 year olds birthday party and the sweet owners and managers of this  restaurant SAVED the day! I literally walked in the night before the party and they let me use their their restaurant for a 40 person 3 year old birthday party the next day. They were so kind and accommodating and my little girl got to make her own pizza in the back for free. They let me bring my own drinks, fruit and cupcakes. We just had to order the pizza, and that was all! It's an awesome venue for any type of party whether for adults or children. I'd go back a thousand more times and will  definitely be using them for future parties too!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazingly delicious wood-fired pizza and very attentive staff. It is our family's new place to enjoy excellent food in a family friendly environment. Hats off to the staff and owners. Thanks for bringing DeSanos to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"In comparison to Inizio I would say the location and ambience is better, pricing is comparable and the pizza a step below."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza and cool environment. I will definitely be back for many more pizza nights with delicious draft beers! It was so good, I forgot to take a picture before eating!"}
{"text":"This was hands down one of the best pizza experiences we ever had! The fromage calzone with sweet peppers and sausage...OMG, out of this world!!!!! If you are near the uptown area, check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. We loved it. Cool atmosphere, the pizza is out of this world good. We had the Margherita which is a typical Neapolitan pizza. These types of pizzerias are popping up all over Charlotte. DeSano's does it right- definitely worth a try if you haven't been here before."}
{"text":"Excellent quality pizza! The food was delicious. We also tried the meatballs and they were great, the sauce was authentic and fresh tasting. We would have preferred table service at a restaurant like this. However, they have only been open a few days and you can tell that the staff and management are still working everything out. Impressive Italian red wine selection, we did not try any of their white wine selection. Amazingly friendly staff that made you feel welcome in their establishment. Highly recommend giving this place a try!!"}
{"text":"This place has becoming a traditional place for me. They use authentic ingredients straight from Italy, the crust of the pizza is not too thick and not too thin, the flavor and quality of the veggies are on point. Not greasy at all. We come here every Sunday and it has become our ritual Sunday evening , you can also buy a bottle of wine in the same place, great combination !"}
{"text":"I had heard really good things about this place and was finally able to check it out. I have to say, while I enjoyed it, it wasn't quite as good as I was hoping. 

It's a fast casual restaurant, so you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. We went for lunch and it wasn't crowded so we got our food pretty fast. 

We ordered the small San Gennaro and a small Capricciosa to split with two people. It was definitely more food than you need for two. I really liked the San Gennaro, but I didn't think the Capricciosa was that good. I tried a little bit of someone else's Desano and it was also good. I would recommend sticking to the meat pizzas -- they seem to be a lot better than the veggie ones. 

I was hoping that it would be as good as Inizio since it's the same style of pizza, but it didn't quite live up to that. I think Inizio has better crust and flavor. 

All and all, while I was hoping for a bit more, this is still a really good pizza place that I enjoyed having lunch at!"}
{"text":"Yes please. Bring me all the straight-from-Italy pizza.

The first thing that surprised me about DeSano's building was just how spacious it was. I wasn't expecting a huge indoor area that kind of spilled into a pretty decent sized patio. This is a wonderful place for families to come and hang out. Order at the register (feel free to ask questions, like what certain ingredients are. Chances are, it's a type of cheese you didn't know about) and they'll give you a table puck thingy, they'll bring the food when it's ready. While you're waiting, feel free to get yourself a cup of parmesan cheese, or some olive oil, balsamic, or chili oil. Or all of them. Just sayin.

I personally ordered the Desano (gotta go with the namesake for my first time here) and it was delicious. Crispy crust, fantastic quality ingredients, and the whole thing came out very quickly. You could see them making it as we said our orders, and the pizzas are cooked for 90 seconds, so you won't be waiting for long. Plus, each pizza was 8 true slices, so I didn't feel like I was starving myself to create leftovers (my heart told me yes, but my body told me no). 

Anyways, I'll happily return to DeSano for some more delicious Italian goodness. Great work, guys!"}
{"text":"Eat here regularly, really love the pizza!  We like to sit at the bar, and enjoy the friendly service from Kyee or any of the other great staff. Our only beef with Desano is the lack of drink options.  Would love to see a better spread of craft beers, cocktails, wine, and of course some Fireball!!  I think better drink options"}
{"text":"HUGE FAN! 

In full transparency we were about to wait in line forever at a competitor that recently opened and walked out of that place after discovering DeSano's on Yelp. As far as I'm concerned I don't need to ever try the competitor. DeSano is a giant location. The only downside to this place is the parking lot is way too small for the size of the restaurant but you can park on the street.

I'm pumped to see this place grow and have a killer Neapolitan pizza spot to frequent as it cools down this Fall. Their outdoor seating is awesome and they have a fireplace that looks like it will be cozy this winter.

We ordered four different pies. The Diavola which was fire, a Margherita,  a marinara with meatballs and a San Gennaro and all were tasty. Will be back for take out and to sit down. Can't wait to bring a group of people here for some beers and pizza. 

Oh and staff was friendly and attentive. And who I believe was the manager, stopped by our table to check on us. Always a nice touch in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owner and staff will go above and beyond to make you feel like at home. Their pizza is really authentic Italian pizza. Highly recommend their signature Desano Pizza!"}
{"text":"Made first visit last night and very glad we went. Salad very fresh; the thin crust pizza was full of flavor...outstanding. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and thrilled to hear they just opened another location at Waverly in south Charlotte. We've only tried the 3rd street location and have been impressed each time. We love their Desano pizza and I've also tried their Bianca with some toppings added. I wasn't a big fan of their caprese salad, but when it comes to pizza, this place is our current favorite!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an off night, but I was not as impressed with Desano's as my fellow Yelpers.  I had Desano's bookmarked for a while and decided to check them out on a Sunday evening. Upon arriving the parking lot had only two other cars...not a good sign in my mind.
Once inside I reviewed the menu, which are placed on a barrel when you walk in the door. In my mind not the best spot due to the fact it is where the line is supposed to start. Anyhow, I decided to stick with the Margarita Pizza and add Pepperoni and a glass of wine.  I received a number and my receipt, which you then take took a bar on the other side of the restaurant to pick up your alcoholic beverage.  
Once my pizza arrived I was definitely underwhelmed.  Unlike true Italian pizza, which shouldn't be all about the toppings, the pepperoni took over the entire pie.  After taking my first bite I was not impressed. The crust was good, but the sauce and cheese lacked flavor. And, not sure what to say about the pepperoni.  First, way too much and second, so oily it took over everything else. I proceeded to eat the crust from the pizza and called it a night.
Overall, I may give them another shot, but at this point Desano's is not a pizza joint I will be running back to."}
{"text":"Nice looking place but no one around. The place was empty beside for us. There was a worker with his head laying on the bar asleep (he may have been off duty idk but still)! 
The pizza was great. Good quality ingredients, great crust, and also a little assortment of extras (red pepper, oregano, balsamic, parm...) nearby. 
Other dissatisfactions: The prices were high and the menu was over complicated and disorganized."}
{"text":"This is the MOST DELICIOUS pizza I have ever had!
The ingredients are so fresh and yummy. You should try the spinach salad too! Wish they had a location nearer where I live. The 30 minute drive was worth every mile:)"}
{"text":"The service staff was super friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is great. I only give this rating as the pizza is average. We had the desano pizza and the kids loved the sausage but we have had better pizza. The meatballs we ordered were really good. Once again, the service was amazing but the pizza was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Love the space & communal style seating. Pizza was fantastic, ordered the Capricciosa (artichokes were tasty). Negatives - need more by the glass wine options, as well as the ability to order beer at the initial point of sale, not just as the bar. Overall great spot."}
{"text":"Real pizza in Charlotte stinks.  Just an inarguable fact.  There are some decent spots that have specialty pizza, like pure pizza, but NY style pizza is a mess. Desano is good, though.  They have wood fired pizza that is really good.  There are some decent toppings options like meatballs, fresh mozzarella and pepperoni. Their calzones are also really good.  

The only downside is the price is on the higher end for pizza, so the value may not be the greatest, but if you are looking for some above average pizza is Charlotte, Desano won't let you down."}
{"text":"Really had high hopes, yet DeSano's was not on point when a friend and I went for lunch around 1:30pm on a weekend recently. We were the only patrons apart from a couple, the employee that took our order acted bothered and condescending as it was our first visit and the menu was unfamiliar. Thankfully we are huge pizza fans so I ordered quicker than I would have liked just to get away from the cash register. Yes, it was that bad. At different points there were no employees even present in the entire restaurant? The pizza itself was not \"bad\", yet the experience with service made both of us, one time only patrons."}
{"text":"This New Yorker approves!  Very happy to have this pizza place in our new city. The Margherita pizza was delicious--soft, charred crispy crust. San Marzano tomato sauce (a must), good cheese and pepperoni. A large pie is plenty for two people. The restaurant is huge, looks like it could have once been a BBQ place. Big big parties will be more than accommodated. But also small single eaters as well. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"It was just OK to me. If you've been to Alino's in Mooresville or Concord Mills, you'll know that many other brick oven Neapolitan pizza places just aren't as good. Also, the house bloody mary mix, while obviously homemade and fresh, is really sweet. Probably the worst bloody mary I've had besides when I was overseas and they gave me straight tomato juice. All in all.. I just can't justify spending $50 on a 16\" pizza and two drinks that altogether should have been $30 tops with tip."}
