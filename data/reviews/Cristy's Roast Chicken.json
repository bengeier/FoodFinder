{"text":"I really like this branch. The staff is friendly, the selection is satisfying, and the chicken, oh golly, so delicious!!

The chicken can sometimes be salty and so do the veggies, but when they make it well they make it well!! When I'm not of sure what to eat, I go there.

The potatoes are really good, I tried to imitate it when I was in highschool but it ended up tasting like soap.

Kidding aside, I'd recommend this place second to Mary Brown's accross the parking lot."}
{"text":"How does one describe Cristy's Chicken? I feel like it's a cross between food court Chinese food and home cooking... except not quite quite cooking calibre. The combos are very much of the 'one meat and two sides' variety, the meat itself tends to be of the saucy variety (I like mesquite chicken the best), but then your choice of sides ranges from noodles or rice (Chinese food style) to baked potatoes smothered in butter and dill or a few different kinds of salad. Do you see where I get the Chinese food/home cooking combination?

Cristy's is by no means a must eat, but I will definitely choose it above other spots in any food court. Although those potatoes are tasty enough to draw me in if I'm a few blocks away from a Cristy's. But then again, so's just about any food smothered in butter and dill. Mmmm."}
{"text":"This is the continuation of my review we got to eat our food during our lunch time and it was all gone. We ate the 2 whole chicken well I'm exaggerating. ..but a piece left...with full belly....lots of good was consumed...could barely work after that big meal. 
All of us are happy...good food and great company...but could barely walk ...lol.
