{"text":"I had a lunch at Garosu Korean Restaurant last Monday. By accident, I found Garosu Korean Restaurant downtown Calgary. It was a small and fancy Korean Restaurant, located on 7 Ave SW Calgary. It was my first visited this place. I arrived restaurant around 2 pm, which is right after the lunch time.  The restaurant was not very busy. After I walked inside the restaurant and sat down, the server brought the menu to me. The menu was very simple without pictures. I have ordered Vegetable Ramen for lunch. The food came out the kitchen fast. The taste of noodles was so salty. I was not very like the taste of the soup. The price of the vegetable ramen is expensive. I miss Vancouver Ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent And fairly authentic Korean restaurant. I came her for lunch during a work day and was pleasantly surprised at the variety in choices ranging from authentic Korean as well as Japanese and Chinese inspired dishes. One of my co workers is Korean and was speaking with the servers who were Korean, which is a sign on authenticity. 

We ordered a seafood pancakes, cold noodles, a spicy ramen and kalbi dish. Food is served with a couple of sides. Pricing is very reasonable given location in the downtown core.

Will definitely come again from my quick Asian fix!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just a place to fill your tummy when you feel like Korean food. Came here for lunch with a colleague. Selection is limited. 

So we got two dishes to share:
Kalbi - $12.95
Bulgogi - $12.95

It came with rice, salad and soup. Purple rice

So the food is ok. Not like super flavorful. They do serve the Kalbi and Bulgogi on a sizzling pan. 

DÃ©cor is ok. I have notice that this place is not busy during lunch time and so it tells you that its pretty ordinary.

Its like food court style but with some service and that its inside a restaurant."}
