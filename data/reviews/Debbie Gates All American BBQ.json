{"text":"I have to say, this was a terrible dining experience for my wife and I.  The appearance of the restaurant is very dirty and outdated and then once we went inside it only got worse.  They have eight year olds working as servers and the actual servers (two 20 something aged girls with bad attitudes) ignored us for probably 15-20 mins before even taking our order.  The food was even worse.  The burger was plain, small, unappetizing, and had no taste.  The \"ribs\" were AWFUL.  Reheated, half cold ribs that had cold BBQ sauce just thrown over the top of them and served.  The french fries were decent though, but very greasy.  Overall, I would not recommend eating here, ever.  It was a bad experience all around.  Crappy food, staff had an attitude, and unless you like eating with a bunch of 5-9 year olds literally running around the restaurant, just do yourself a favor and pass on this place.  Take a ride past it, sometime though.  It looks the part even from the outside."}
{"text":"Bought  a Groupon so decided to try this place.  Very disappointing experience.  Husband liked his burger, and my pulled pork sandwich wasn't to bad, but the hand breaded onion rings were soggy and tasted like they were fried in oil that was rancid. I sent them back and the waitress didn't say a word.  The place was dirty looking and generally a mess. Stuff was piled up behind the counter (old printers, old bev machines. ). The attitude of the help was not what it should be. the waitress was to busy checking her cellphone to check on us.  Iwon't be redeeming my 2nd groupon for anything there."}
{"text":"Not a fan. My husband and I were intrigued by this place a few weeks ago when we were on our way to Papa J's. We decided to order take out Saturday night and give it a try. When my husband picked up the order, the restaurant was dead. One table walked in as he was leaving. I ordered the grilled chicken salad and he got the pulled pork entree. My salad consisted of iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese, tomatoes, onions, chicken, fries and a piece of overcooked, inedible bacon casually thrown on top the salad. Was this supposed to be the real bacon bits as listed on the menu? The chicken was also barely edible due to being over cooked and extremely dry. On the plus side, the fries were fresh cut and would have been tasty if they weren't cold. My husband did enjoy his pulled pork but did not feel it was \"award winning\" as described in the menu. His greens and potato salad were barely edible. He took two bites and threw the rest away. Atypical behavior for the man I refer to as a \"human garbage disposal\". Maybe their speciality- wings, waffles and funnel cakes are better but, I'm not going to take the chance. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"BBQ and burger diner.  Of course the walls are decorated in Red, White and Blue.  Sign says they have breakfast but do not open until 9.  Sat at the counter and the wait staff was very friendly.  I ordered the Pulled Pork with BBQ sauce on a homemade bun and the Fresh Cut Fries.  The pulled pork was good and the BBQ sauce really added some kick.  The fries were very good and hot (needed to add salt).  The menu has lots of burgers, brisket, some big wings (someone) had a big bowl of wings, ribs, steak and more."}
