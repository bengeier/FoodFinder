{"text":"Baked chicken is the only thing I ever really order from here (not bad - the portions are big and the chicken tastes fab w/ the cream sauce)...they have late night specials too if you order after 10 I think. Service SUCKS and I've often had to ask for another set of cutlery as its never really cleaned properly. Other than that I'd still return just for the baked chicken on rice."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food. Decent price too. Service can be a little slow sometimes, but overall it's a pleasant place to eat at."}
{"text":"Nope, nope, nope.  From the sticky table, to the tea in plastic, to the choy lacking salt, uncooked rice, and flavorless foo yoong - nope.  We're talking basics, here.  I am still looking for a decent place to dig my chopsticks into decent traditional Chinese food."}
{"text":"Everyone here is nice and my Cantonese gf loves it. Always have to get get the French toast :P  but try looking at the dish specials they are cheaper and still a good portion.   Only negative comment I have is some dishes they use Too much sauce, would be better if they used only half of the sauce... Try getting some steamed rice so if its too saucy it'll balance it out :)"}
{"text":"These guys have the worst customer service ever! Had a craving for some soup and drove all the way to go pick up cos they had just dropped their menu advert on my doorstep that week and I decided to try them out. Their Chicken corn soup was the worst I've ever had and for 6 dollars I didn't get up to 10 grains of corn per bowl..Called to ask what that was about and the Chinese lady who answered was extremely rude..Stay away from these guys. Am back to my regular Chinese restaurant. Customer service is VERY important to me. You can serve crappy food with a good attitude and I'll give you a second try but bad attitude is a huge turn off."}
{"text":"Everything here is okay, and this place is somewhat dirty.  This is not the same Phoenix as the other chinese \"Phoenix\" in richmond hill and markham.   The food is below average, or average"}
{"text":"Been here a few times since living beside it for almost the last 20 years. Food is good, but if they spent some money on renovations and made it look more fresh, the food would taste better, my foot would either slip on tiles from grease or stick to the carpets as it seems the carpets and interior are the same from 20 years ago.   Still an institution of sauga."}
{"text":"Have only stayed once but have gotten take out quite a few times.   Food is really good."}
{"text":"This is probably more like a comfort food to go place.  The service was slow. It was only one waitress with about 8 tables being served.  The food was also so-so. Then again, I came here mostly because of some nostalgic memories.  I had the rice with fish and cheese baked (I think) and took home some salted fish fried rice.  The rice baked stuff was okay. It was more like eating salt and the fried rice was okay too. I've had better."}
{"text":"Affordable Chinese food that will satisfy a craving.  Great Beef in Black Bean sauce on Rice Noodles and the Cold Milk tea is my favourite."}
{"text":"Very basic Chinese restaurant atmosphere made me wary of eating here, but we decided to try it anyway. Service was a bit slow but pleasant and the menu was quite basic. We ordered the dinner for 3 which was good and reasonably price. Asked about beverages. ..... Very limited choices offered as none were on the menu. Served in the can with a plastic cup. All in all, good food value, but old and tired furnishings and decor makes this a place i won't be returning to. Smelled  fishy."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by the customer service , food and environment. Food was so bad I ordered vegetable fried rice And it came out to be rice with peas and very little broccoli. They took order of the people who came after us first and made us wait. Only 2 people working throughtout the restaurant. Had to wait for a long time to get my order taken. Food was very bland . Definitely never coming back again."}
{"text":"Solid solid restaurant for cha cha tang food and chinese-western fusion. They make the best baked rice + baked escargot combos! Great food for a great price! Make sure you get their set meals or upgrade to a combo! Comes w a tea/coffee or can upgrade to a nice iced lemon tea (my fav classic!!) Or horlicks. My family has been going here for decades and we still visit this iconic cafe as a reminder of our childhood. Awesome place for dinner or late night dinners!!"}
{"text":"This used to be the best place for asian delivery however recently they have been slippin. I reccomend beef lo mein here it is fantastic. Deep fried chicken wind were tasty but a little on the large side"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places.  The spicy eggplant with meat and the baked chicken with cream sauce are my all time favourites! We always always order those dishes.   The BLT sandwich is always pretty good and so are the fried chicken wings. The shanghai noodles and Singapore noodles are very delicious as well.  Pros Generous and big portions  The waiters are attentive  Price is good for the size of the dishes They offer free delivery over $25 (they raised it, it was $20 before) Food is fast Good Deals after 9pm  Cons The decorations are pretty old fashioned"}
{"text":"I have been ordering take out here for at least the last five years. It is a hole in the wall but the food is consistently delicious! Price is reasonable for the quantity and you always get what you expect! If you're looking to fill a craving for Chinese food and aren't all about ambience this is the place."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant after maybe like 15+ years, and it was pure disappointment. Back in the days, it used to be a decent restaurant my family would frequent but over the years, it has gotten worse and has not bothered to improve.   From the old decor that has not been updated, to the mediocre food that all taste exactly the same, to the horrible but typical asian service (the type that's just bordering rude because they've probably served too many difficult asian customers). Bathroom was unclean and horrendous - they definitely did not spend any more money on the restaurant itself. Service: asked for napkins twice, and finally decided to get up and ask the person at the front desk to get my own. The server proceeded to throw down 3 napkins 5 minutes later for our party of 10. Lovely.  It was really packed for Sunday lunch which was a real surprise because the place is really run-down from the years. We ordered 7 different \"baked\" dishes from the lunch menu and all the meats were fried cutlets (where the chicken, pork, fish all taste the same cause they are exactly fried in the same batter smothered in the same tomato-based or cream-based sauce).  No variation between dishes. Dishes are REALLY filling and huge while the price is cheap (probably under $10 and enough to fill 2-3 people). But are you really interested in eating mediocre, bordering fast food quality type food? If you are, this may be the place for you. If not, please stay away. I know it'll be another 15 years before I'll be back... if it still exists by then."}
{"text":"Okay people, this ain't a fancy ass HK eatery, OK. Once you get past the torn chairs and the geriatric client√®le, this place is actually pretty decent!   We ordered the staples: baked pork chop with tomato sauce on fried rice and beef brisket noodle soup. Both dishes were good... But because they were both 5.99 each, they were excellent! I wouldn't go here for a nice dinner or a date but when you just want a quick meal... Can't complain!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Chinese Restaurant is in the same plaza as Bubble Republic.  They offer a wide variety of combos at a very good place.  They surprisingly server escargot here as well.  They have a lot of good sizzling plate combos, I always get the steak one.  You get bread, soup and a drink with the combo which is excellent value.  Service is here is decent but it can get busy as there isn't that much Chinese diner in Mississauga.  Parking here is easy as the plaza is massive and never too busy from the couple times I been here.  The decor of the place needs some work as it is a pretty old looking place.  Rating:  Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 3/5 Decor  2/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 5/5"}
{"text":"I tried the baked dish it was nothing special. The service was good but the decor was old and dated. It was not busy for a dinner time. I would not come back. It was pricey for the quality of good. The sauce tasted like heated up Campbell soup. :("}
{"text":"My go to place in the evenings when other places are closed, or when I feel like eating well for cheap. The food qualify is good for the price,  but they could do better.  This place has the traditional tacky 1980s Chinese restaurant decor, and I am cool with that. The service is acceptable, even though not all the servers have a mastery of the English language.  I usually get the 9.99$ steak special, a noodle dish of some type,  or their 4 course Lobster meal for 24$ when I feel like it.  Overall,  this place is worth coming to eat at, but do not expect to be overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I honestly like this place a lot. Like, a lot a lot. I always suggest this place for lunch once week, and I always order the same thing. I love their baked spaghetti with meat sauce. It comes with a bowl of soup (did I mention I love HK cafe cream soups? LOVE), and a drink to wash it all down.   Now let's understand this spaghetti. The sauce holds minced carrots, minced beef and minced onions like nobody's business. It's not just your plain ketchup sauce that they put on top of a fried chicken steak (which is also good, by the way) - it comes with texture and vegetables that I don't get anywhere else. It is SO good.   So why did I knock it a star when I can't shut up about the dish? Service is mostly good, but sometimes they can be really busy and we've had to refill our teas or get our own bowls on a few occasions. And sometimes their consistency is off (one time I ordered my spaghetti and got angel hair pasta instead, which was also more watery).   But take me here any way and I'm a happy happy person."}
{"text":"Wow, I think the first time I went to Phoenix was at least 13 years ago... haha! When I was younger we'd love to go here as a family mainly because of the large variety on their menu. However, after the last time I went, Phoenix just didn't really stand out to me anymore.  First of all, the menu still carries a large variety of food, but I feel like that's no longer unique to them anymore.   Second, maybe my memories became romanticized but I remember the food being a lot tastier. Maybe they changed owner? It has been a while since the last time I came. Regardless, I was disappointed by the food.  Third, the decor has not changed since 13 years ago. A little progress would be nice.  Like I said before, Phoenix used to be one of the few restaurants I really liked but now it's just your average Mississauga restaurant. I feel like it never really tried to improve? I guess I would still come visit the next time I'm in Toronto, but that's probably just for sentimental reasons. Do yourself a favor and go to Yummy Yummy instead (just a couple footsteps away)."}
{"text":"I come here mostly during lunch and I've been satisfied every time. Normally I order baked rice and it takes a while because of a busy lunch but it tastes great, decently priced, and great portions. I tried their dinner menu this time and went for the lamb. The appetizers of soup (Russian soup?) and dinner rolls arrived rather quickly. The soup is tasty although I feel it would be better eaten during winter because it gives a strong peppery bite. I couldn't care less about the dinner rolls but the lamb was of my tastes. A sweet, meaty-tasting sauce accompanied the lamb that was easy to cut and chew, came with a side of veggies and rice, along with a choice of hot beverage. It also arrived quickly, probably because of the slow Wednesday traffic. Service was fine, the place was somewhat quiet with not a lot of charm. I'm not all about that if I'm looking for a quick and cheap dinner. Overall I'm happy to have tried their dinner menu for the first time and I'll probably come in later more rather than just lunch time."}
{"text":"Ridiculous service. Standing around doing nothing. Took at least 10 minutes to get their attention only to wait another 10 minutes to other. What kind of service is this   I've never experienced service this bad. Rude and lazy servers. I wonder how this place is still in business. The food isnt even good. Cold food and cold soup. In what world is soup served cold. The server just places the bread on the edge on the table. I mean.  Seriously.... Are you kidding me."}
{"text":"Great late night eats!  Happy hour drink with meal is the deal!  Baked ox tongue on rice or malaysian fried noodle are my recommendations.    Their steak is also a great deal.  Dont come here and expect a great looking resto.  This is the place known for late night grimey eats. 4/5 food 3/5 venue 5/5 convenience 5/5 value & price 3/5 service"}
{"text":"Cheap dining choice...the easy late night choice... You pay for what you get.... Not much more to day. The half and half coffee milk tea is worth the try."}
{"text":"I used to come here when I was younger and would take my parents out to this place for special occasions.  We would get some type of special combos with soup, escargot, entree and a dessert for around $10-$20.  Yes, some dishes were $10 for all that back then.  I came here recently and ordered a baked pork chop with rice and got soup along with it.  The bake on the pork chop was nice and the rice was good, however I found the soup to be lackluster and the pork chop to be somewhat bland.  So for food 2.5/5.  What's really disappointing about this place is that it hasn't renovated in over 15 years and looks very dated.  The dishes where they serve the food also look very worn out and they've been used for over 10 years.    Verdict: while not a bad meal, it's average at best and there are many more options around the area now."}
{"text":"Late night? Done studying and need a place to eat? Boom. You found the place.  I'm not giving the place 4 stars because of the service or the restaurant itself because that's appalling. I'll give a 4 just for the food. Lots of variety and open late. Plus if you're a university student chances are you are just trying to get a cheap delicious meal.  (Not the best place to bring your girlfriend on a date, you'll see why)"}
{"text":"I really like this place!! They have nice booths and the tables are set far apart.  It is simple and the servers are friendly and actually speak English.  I enjoy the menu offerings, which is Hong Kong style.    They have lunch specials which are available on the weekends also.  The specials run from 11-ish am to 3pm.  The serving size is generous.  During this lunch visit, we ordered the beef ho fun which could feed two people and it cost around $8.50.  We also ordered the two entree deal, which is, 2 entrees with one cup of rice with each entree for $19.75 or so.  They also have the three entree special for $27.95.  I am not sure of the exact price to the cent, but I do know that it is a good deal.  For the two entrees, we ordered the spicy salted squid.  It was not that salty or spicy.  However, it was quite crispy and moist.  The other entree we ordered was the ginger and green onion beef.  It was flavourful and had just the right amount of ginger and green onion.  There was a lot of meat and I do think it's worth it to order.  This place is a solid choice for Hong Kong style Chinese food and I am tempted to just keep coming back here and not try anything new because, yea it's that good!"}
{"text":"Coming home late from a road-trip? post-clubbing? or perhaps everything around you is already closed. This is the place that's is open 36 hours a day. From a night crawlers to another, you know it.  Many chefs work here. Because I order the same sesame fried chicken and rice every time, but it always tastes and looks different. But at 2:00a.m in the morning who cares.   Food arrives fast (less than 10 minutes) NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED! Debt and cash only! Come prepared!   Parking is a breeze at 2:00a.m no complaints there.   I'd definitely remain as customer for years to come. Make the effort to come here instead of Tremendous Restaurant that is 3 lights away if you don't want food poisoning."}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to try this location of Phoenix Chinese restaurant.  Phoenix is a Chinese style western diner.  Imagine starting with a western meal and adding Chinese food seasoning and interpretation into the mix.  The result is a very unique, distinctive taste.  We ordered a dinner meal with escargot as the appetizer and pork chop and spaghetti as the main course.  Hot almond milk for the drink.  A second dinner combo was ordered with tomato soup appetizer, steak + vegetables + noodles as the main course and hot almond milk for the drink.  I enjoyed my meal because the food was good and because of Phoenix's very distinctive style, I liked some items more than others.  I loved the bread roll they gave us before the appetizers came.  It was hot and soft and one of the best I've had in a long time.  The escargot was baked with some cheese and was very good also, but when I sampled the tomato soup I thought it too heavily flavoured and the pepper was too strong.  For the main courses. Both the pork chop and the steak were yummy and I would order them again.  I liked the steak slightly better as the pork chop was covered with a very large amount of tomato sauce.  However, I want to note the steak came with vegetables and a very small portion of noodles and the pork chop came with a very large amount of spaghetti.  Overall. I enjoyed a unique and above average experience.  3.7 / 5.0"}
{"text":"This is definitely your late night grimy, but oh so good Chinese food.  A good place for when you are craving Chinese food late at night  (not many places are open late in Mississauga). They have a late-night menu after 9pm, that is cheap and comes with a free drink.  The place gets really busy late nights, and sometimes you have to wait for a table.  I usually order the Baked Bolognaise on Spagetti, or the Fried Malaysian Noodle with a Cold Milk Tea.  It's usually about $7-8 for the meal."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick bite or a late night meal, Phoenix is just the right place. Don't expect nice decor or a fancy place... You will get good food, fast service and hot milk tea that hits the spot. My recommendations are the baked rice/spaghetti items, particularly the baked chicken or ox tongue with tomato sauce. The portion of the protein to the carbs is just right and the sauce is pretty good. My parents enjoy the creme sauce.. But I'm a tomato sauce kinda girl!  My bf loves the Malaysian style rice noodles.. It's his must have- right amount of curry flavour and stir fried with just the right amount of oil.  I like to come at lunch times or after 9pm for their special menu that has many items to choose from at a great price. All the dishes come with a drink which is an added bonus imo since what is a HK style meal without a beverage?!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my two friends were not interested in sharing, so I can only judge one dish (beef w/ rice noodles and black bean sauce). For $10 with tax + tip, you can't really go wrong. Good taste, big portions. Service is reasonably fast, though the restaurant was kind of empty on a Friday afternoon.   Keep in mind this is modern Chinese food - Dishes with spaghetti, baked ox tongue in tomato sauce. If you're looking for a traditional meal, the plaza at Burnhamthorpe/Creditview is a better bet. This is more like a 3.5, but I rounded up."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm I'm craving pasta?  Okay where you want to go?  Phoenix!  I've never been. Oh no? It's a Chinese restaurant. Wait, I thought you wanted pasta?  You'll see..............  Are you as curious as I was? I didn't even bother asking questions, I just drove as fast as I could to kill my curiosity.  We get to the restaurant and it looks like most Chinese restaurants in Mississauga, plain and straight to the point. Although this place could use some updates, benches were warn out and flooring could use improvement. However you can't really complain too much when there are constantly people coming into the restaurant to eat or pick-up orders.  We get settled in and I don't even bother looking at the menu because I was so curious about this pasta. The choices for the pasta are: beef,  seafood(shrimp and crab) or chicken, with a choice of white or red sauce. My friend tells me to get the white sauce so I did with seafood. The anticipation to try this \"pasta\" dish was killing me, after 5-7 minutes the dish arrives. Right away I grab my spoon to get a piece of it and find out that it's rice topped with a white cream sauce. I was not happy at first b/c I was expecting something totally different, possibly some sort of noodle but not rice! I must admit though the dish grew on me and every bite tasted better than the last.  Wait till after 9pm to visit this place b/c they got a special half price menu or if you are curious like I was the \"pasta\" dish is a must try item, no words can describe it but it's the main reason I go back.  Items to definitely get  - pasta with seafood or beef - cold milk tea (you get to pour your own liquid sugar to make it sweeter) - deep fried spicy squid - Shanghai noodles - anything on the 9pm menu b/c it's cheap and good"}
{"text":"We were looking for a late night resturant and found this on yelp, we decided to give it a try... HORRIBLE idea. We ordered food... noodles had hair in it.. got it remade.. I think and me and my boyfriend ordered sesame chicken and we spent the whole time trying to find the chicken... WASTE of money. Might as well go to mcdonalds and they will provide u better food than this. Will not go there agian. Giving it 2 stars for the nice waiter."}
{"text":"If you're craving for a good take out late night. This place is for you. I haven't dine inside as the place is dilapidated and I always get take out. The bake chicken is the best. Cash only."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for cheap filling dishes, Phoenix is the place. We got the baked seafood combo (milk tea, escargot, bread). It was shrimp, scallops, and other seafood on a bed rice with a thick layer of creamy cheese sauce on top. It's decent for the price you pay so don't expect too much and you'll be satisfied!"}
{"text":"***TIP:  Cash Only.  They have delivery!***  Food quality is like 2-2.5/5   +  Service is prompt, efficient, & polite  +  Portion/Value is 5/5  It's no secret why this place is popular amongst the Chinese crowd...because it's CHEAP!  Big Portions + Low Prices = Popularity.  Beef Brisket Curry ($7.99, came with Soup/post-meal HK milk tea) - Cuts of meat is not of good quality.  Chunks of meat were accompanied by a chunk of fat and I honestly thought it was pork belly due to the fat and texture of meat.  I found the curry itself very, very mild and on the bland side.  Portion was HUGE, leftovers even after sharing!  Rice Noodle w/ Black Bean & Beef - Better than Curry dish.  Again, leftovers even after sharing.  Both dishes were at least 3-4 servings.  Interior desperately NEEDS to be reno'd.  It's outdated, dark, booths are worn out, & all-in-all dingy.  Can be more 'uplifting' by upgrading the lighting, removing water-stained ceiling tiles, smashing those ugly mirrored walls, and a coat (or 2) of paint!  (Guys, NOT SUITABLE FOR DATE-NIGHT, especially a first date unless you're trying to test out if someone is a gold digger.)  As my mom said, \"You won't die eating here!\""}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! If it were possible to give no stars, I would have. First of all, the food isn't good, and their customer service is worse! I ordered delivery, and it took AN HOUR AND A HALF to get here. And after arguing with the driver, and the man at the restaurant (on the phone) because they OVERCHARGED, the ordeal lasted over 2 hours. And they had the nerve to ask to me come to them to pick up the money THEY OWED ME because they made a mistake! As if I would have ordered delivery if I wanted to drive there!   Very disappointed with my first (and only!) Visit to this place. Disgusting food, and disgusting service.   Not to mention what it did to my stomach! Food poisoning!   BEWARE."}
{"text":"Looking for a fancy place? Not here! Looking for great tasty food.. Here!!! I've been going here since they have been opened as a child. My favorite dish is the baked seafood on rice and I alternate from the red sauce to the cream sauce to change it up. I also enjoy the beef brisket curry on rice."}
{"text":"Still my favourite Hong Kong style restaurant in Mississauga! The male servers are always pleasant and polite.  Come after 9pm for happy hour! Not your most fancy schmancy kinda place to dine, but you always leave the place satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Perfect for a family dinner. The waiters were so friendly the whole night. I highly suggest the baked chicken on rice its so good. . Definitely will start coming here all the time."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant has been in Mississauga for years. They serve the staple Hong Kong-style dishes like beef ho fun, baked pork chops in tomato sauce with rice/spaghetti, baked seafood in white sauce with rice/spaghetti, Cantonese chow mein and fried rice. The prices are cheap for the portion of food that you get. If you go from 3-6 or after 9:00, they have specials that come with a drink (Hong Kong style tea, lemon tea, soy milk). This is a quick eat and get out kind of place. The decor is horrendous, the seats are torn and the bathroom is filthy. I usually just order take out and eat at home."}
{"text":"We go to Phoenix restaurant at least once a month. Our favorites are the decently priced special combos. This is one of the very few Chinese restaurants that serve Escargot! The Ox tongue is one of out fav dishes. Yes and the cold milk tea or tong lai cha is very good!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's AMAZING for delivery, late at night and always consistent quality.  One of the ONLY places I miss in Mississauga since I moved in March!!!  I always delivery order the Cantonese Chow Mein, 2 different kinds of fried rice, Cantonese Sweet and Sour Pork (Yippeeee, it's boneless!!!), Spring rolls, plus extra sweet and sour sauce (for the rice of course!!).    They are very generous with the toppings for the Chow Mein, and the Cantonese pork is always great.  Really great reheated too!    If you want great Chinese delivery in Mississauga, consistent, quality, AND open VERY late, call them!!!!!  Hey Phoenix, open a NEW location in Etobicoke soon PLEASE!!!  I miss you."}
{"text":"If one goes here it is mainly for the company of friends or takeout instead of the food which is really cheap and tasty .My go to item is the baked chicken . Service is quick and I have no issues there.  If you are  in the area and want to cut some pennies while enjoying  some good times  over tasty food then  head to  Phoenix ."}
{"text":"Aite. Phoenix is the TO-GO place for late night munchies at happy hour price. It doesn't get too packed past 9 and they're opened till 1230-1 depending on the day. My favourite thing to order from the happy hour menu is the baked chicken on spaghetti with cream sauce. You can get it with tomato sauce too but it's the Asian style sauce where it's a bit sweet. All happy hour menu comes with a drink. Cold drinks are an additional .75c and the cold milk tea/coffee is really good. Generally all the cold drinks are good and there's a few you can pick from. The restaurant is quite spacious and there are 2 large round tables by the window.  It's not a problem to split bills, just let them know. Payment is cash or credit card only. Can pay at the counter, no need to wait.  One of my favourite Chinese restaurants. Always down to go here!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite late night places to go to as they are open until 12am and even later on the weekends.  They have good set meals which include a soup and a drink for around $11.  The place is very plain and decorated just like a simple coffee shop.  Service is obviously not the greatest but food comes fast and is quite tasty.  We like their Hong Kong style tea here .   They do have good deals for steaks here but they are not your whopping 8 or 16oz ones.  A thin slice but pretty good for $8.    They can also accommodate big groups as they do consistently have groups of 10-12 ppl on a table.  Lots of mid twenty yr olds come here after their late night badminton games.    Would definitely recommend this for a good late night dinner or snack time."}
