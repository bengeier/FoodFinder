{"text":"I have Meal Prepped with other companies and Frans Kitchen has blown everyone out of the water!   When the typical goal is to get lean or to bulk up, the standard... ground turkey, rice & veggies... is the go-to.  However, when you prep with Fran... your taste buds are stimulated with FLAVOR and ingredients that you can't find anywhere else!  I did 3 days worth and each meal was SO filling and I almost couldn't eat all of it!   My husband who has completely different goals than me, enjoyed it if not more than I did!  We will be ordering more food from Frans Kitchen to begin our fitness journeys from now on!   Easy to order, you can place your OWN orders if you have a favorite, and there are different plans you can choose from for what best fits you!   go to the website and just enter in your information- Fran will PERSONALLY call you to go over goals, allergies and plans!   If you are tried of the bland turkey and rice combo- check her out.   Best decision I've made!"}
{"text":"Frans kitchen has got to be one of the best meal prep companies in Arizona. The food is amazing, it taste great and it's not your cookie cutter meal prep service.   They have a variety of plans tailored to individual goals and needs."}
{"text":"This is an ingenious idea! Frans a master mind and her team is awesome.  I did the AIP DIET (autoimmune protocol) because I have fibromyalgia. Though there were a few hiccups at first it took about 3 weeks and the pain went bye-bye.  Frans meal plan did several things right but what I figured out that it did best was it taught me moderation and portion control. It's not good enough to eat good but you can't eat like you're in a buffet every day. It wasn't hard like other diets I've done because the food was hardy. They do all the work and you just heal and lose weight. That's right heal. Because if you eat the every day American diet than I guarantee you you need a little healing. And if you don't have an autoimmune disease than any of these diet plans she has will heal you. If you do have an autoimmune disease than I highly suggest the AIP.  Now to the food!! AMAZING!! I'm a variety person that likes to try new things. Between my wife and I we were constantly floored by how good things tasted, and didn't even know what it was half the time. Very exotic type foods (too us at least). Her plantation chips are better than I've ever had. She should bag them and get rich. I don't think there's a meal I didn't like and she even made her beets so that I liked beets. Now that takes a good cook, because I usually hate beets! It was all just marvelous and such a good learning process.  It seems like the meals are a big bill but remember, it's organic, vegetables are fresh and she works with local farmers to try and get as much as she can right there from farmer to her kitchen. Nothing is frozen!! Now those 3 things are big and hard to obtain. Then she has awesome cooks that follow her lead and finally delivers every ounce of food straight to your door! Bravo!! Pure genius and what a blessing she has become for others that can't and didn't know how to eat so healthy. Your health is worth that and more.  Still trying to decide whether you should try it or not and if it's worth it? Check out her reviews on all sites and let the people who have tried it decide for you.  Nothing else to say other than thank you for the experience and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The meals feels very gourmet healthy food but it just wasn't my taste. I don't feel like the history that she obtains of your likes and not likes were completely taken into consideration. I wanted low carb, ketogenic, simple vegetable/ meats. What I got was just a wide range of things I had never eaten or tried in my life. I'm a picky eater so this just wasn't for me. When ordering, it just seemed like it was whatever was on the menu for the week. I don't like not being able to see a menu and pick which meals I'd want. I am not a great vegetable eater to where I eat anything put in front of me. I ended up throwing away over half of the meals. I think that for the open minded eater, this is a great option."}
{"text":"This is an update to my post a week ago. I have now been charged $260 after cancelling my subscription. They charged me on Friday and I tried to get in contact with them the same day. I left 2 voicemails and sent 1 email all before 12pm. Fran contacted not me personally but my husband. She said she would call him back and we are still waiting on that call after leaving her another message. This company has no follow though!!! I did not get any follow up until Monday morning when I got a casual email stating they will \"look into it\" and get back to me. It is now Saturday night and I have not heard back from anyone after sending a follow up email to the one I received Monday. I had canceled my subscription within the week time frame since I was only supposed to get deliveries once a week. I have now disputed all charges with my bank since no one will get back to me. There is absolutely no communication between their employees and there is no follow up or any follow through. I would highly recommend you never waste your money on this business. They never answer their phones so you can never get in touch with anyone, the food is mediocre at best, and the customer service has now become the worst I have ever encountered.  3/30/18  Worst experience ever, I would give them 0 stars if I could. The initial encounter was great, I spent 50 minutes on the phone with Robert and we went over all of the questions I had about the plan. It was clearly discussed that I could only receive meals on Tuesday's and asked specifically if they would be delivered around 4 because my husband would be bringing them to flagstaff. I received no follow up that told me that that was not doable so I figured it was fine. Tuesday comes around and my husband has to wait until 730 to receive my meals. Miscommunication mistake number 1 with this company. The second thing that went wrong was on my list of foods I do not eat it clearly stated seafood and mushrooms. A complete mistake on their part. I receive 2 meals that have just that in them and I receive a rotten avocado. The other meals do not look appetizing. The vegetables are all tinged with brown like they are going bad and all of the food was bland. I asked for them to refund the meals that I could not eat (I was told that is not their policy) and they offered me a cooking class which I will never use because I am not local. At this point it is Tuesday night and I cancel my subscription because of first the communication issues they have and second the food was very disappointing and not worth it.   That was fine until Friday when I receive an invoice from their company that they charge after I clearly cancelled. Like I said earlier I was only ever supposed to get a delivery and charged on Tuesdays. I received 5 days worth of food that Tuesday, why the hell would I get another 5 days worth of food on Friday just 2 days later? My husband received a call from Fran who stated she was pissed because all Robert cared about was the initial sale and I wasn't the first customer that happened to. She told him she would call him back later. Do no waste your money or even more importantly your time with this company. The food clearly has a lot of issues. Nothing seemed fresh and how can they charge around $15 for a breakfast meal of 1 egg and 4 little smokeys sausages? It is really disappointing to spend that much money and for the company to really not care or follow though. The worst of it all is that no one ever answered the phone. You can not get ahold of anyone at this place!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmyyyyyy!!! Delicious flavorful food. Great service. You can totally taste the freshness. Locally sourced. My fav was the plantains, beef strips with caramelized onions and the chicken lettuce wraps.  My only holdup is the cost. It's worth it, but tough for me personally to swing weekly."}
{"text":"Fran is awesome. The food and more importantly the advice and expertise is great. I lost 22 lbs and learned that I like plantains in the process"}
{"text":"Fran's kitchen provides the most professional care to all its clients. I have not had one bad meal. Her food has allowed me to get to my ideal body image."}
{"text":"First day! Breakfast was eggs, turkey ham, cantaloupe, honey dew melon. First snack: almonds, sun flower seeds. Yum. I am so happy. If all the food tastes this good then it will be very easy to stick it out. My goal is a minimum of 30 days, 20 pounds. My vice and my challenge will be coffee. I love my morning coffee. Wish me luck!  Day 2. This will be my first complete day. Yesterday I had breakfast and snacks. Today I started with Starbucks. Then breakfast, 3 small pancakes, then an egg, sausage, kale and onions, scramble. Very tasty, surprisingly so. The three small pancakes were a bit chewy. I used the microwave. A toaster oven is suggested. I ordered a toaster oven from Amazon. It should be here tomorrow. Coffee will be my nemesis. I don't drink much but it is my morning ritual for decades.  Lunch. Again, very tasty. A ham, chicken lettuce wrap, topped with some sorta of sauce and diced tomatoes. Soup, I have no idea what it was, quite tasty. Had an almond, sun flower seeds snack. Lots of water.  Dinner. A salad made with mixed greens and cubed papaya. I added a tbsp of Newman's vinaigrette salad dressing. The protein was two boneless chicken thighs. Again, very tasty. Today's second snack was sliced strawberries. Maybe two total."}
{"text":"We had a tough time connecting at first due to some system issues.  Received a call from Robert who took great care of me.  Looking forward to getting started!  Thanks to Robert and Fran for ensuring you had a happy customer."}
{"text":"I tried Fran's Kitchen, because I had to shed some pounds for a wedding and the results were amazing! In 1 month I lost 21 LBS and have never been more thrilled. I had tried the \"diet\" thing before and always felt like I was hungrier than when I started eating. Fran is great with about portion control. You will have a reasonable amount of food, it will be filling. If she mentions the Keto diet, just say yes! It's hardcore but well worth it! You will kiss yourself after you are done. I recommend this to anyone who can stay disciplined enough to make it to their goal and after. I could NOT have done it without her! Sn: Don't cheat, because she has an all seeing eye that will track you down!"}
{"text":"Just an update finished my 30 day challenge today.  I lost exactly the 15 pounds I set for my goal. I ate clean for 30 days, I feel great, and I'm going to need a new belt.    Now off to Costa Rica where I won't be embarrassed to take my shirt off.  Thanks Fran!"}
