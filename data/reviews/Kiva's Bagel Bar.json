{"text":"Kiva's definitely makes good bagels but i don't think they are worth the price point when there are other equally good if not better available options like bagel world, what a bagel, bagel house, st. urbain bagels.... 

I tried the poppy seed twister which was very good however like some other yelpers, I couldn't help but think their bagels were on the smaller end of the spectrum in terms of size (ESPECIALLY when you compare them to the twisters at bagel world- THOSE could almost be used as frisbees) 

Kiva's also is definitely more expensive as I ended up paying 9 dollars for my eggwhite scramble and twister combo (sans drink by the way...) where afterwards i still wanted more food (and ended up at the cinnabon inside yonge and eglinton station)"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite food spots in this neighborhood.  I've frequented it dozens of times - a month.  
Specialties?  Custom salads, especially the spinach leaf with avocado.  And of course it comes with a bagel.

Also try their danishes.  They're not the super-sweet Timmie's type, it's far more subtle with a cheese center.  I make special trips regularly to this place just for the danishes.

Only downside?  Their hours aren't open long enough.  Sometimes you just want a danish or salad later at night."}
{"text":"Kiva's Bagel Bar at St. Clair & Yonge is my go to option for breakfast and lunch.  These guys are fast, friendly and the food it delicious."}
{"text":"I've come here many times, mostly for the avocado salad, which is delicious and very filling, with a Tex-Mex feel. I've also gotten a very heavy cheese-filled pastry whose name I can't recall. I once tried to get one of the \"all day\" breakfast sandwiches at lunchtime. I was told that there would be a 10-minute wait for the egg on a bagel, but that I could get anything else without waiting. I switched to tuna with capers, which was fine. But if I had known that the tuna would cost twice as much ($8 vs $4), I might have waited."}
{"text":"Best Bagel Cafe & Pastry. Mid-Town Toronto

 (15 Saint Clair Avenue W)  A 2 minute walk west of Yonge Street. South Side.

I think this is the perfect cafe spot for anyone seeking a healthy lunch to satisfy their appetite or just wanting an espresso perhaps with something sweet while on the go.

 Its a casual friendly environment, has a seating area and its classy inside (decorated quite cute).& comfortable. The cafe has Wi-fi available which is helpful too.

They have a wonderful variety of fresh baked bagels and breads, including gluten free bagels, breakfast options, tuna, chopped egg, smoked salmon with cream cheese.
Avocado and other veggies for the sandwiches & sides, everything looked and tasted so delirious and fresh.

There is no other place like this mid-town Toronto, so I highly recommend you go to Kiva's next time you find yourself seeking something extra-special to tantalize your taste buds check this cafe out for yourself.

There is also a north end location at Bathurst & Steeles, you may consider that location too... if you're headed up north and need somewhere reliable and fresh to enjoy lunch or desire take out for those long road trips up to the cottage.  I promise if you go here you will be very happy you did. The food is excellent and super fresh."}
{"text":"Used to love this place because the chef and the two initial gals running the shop were fantastic. Super tasty food and REALLY friendly.
Have tried all their omelettes and breakfast sandwiches.
However, again, some staff is just always screw-facing; 
and the owner just pumps his products up to every person who walks through the door.
When you are fantastic, you don't claim to be fantastic to everyone, you just are naturally.
Again, you can eat eggs anywhere, but customer service really affects the mood of the food."}
{"text":"I have been here a few more times since this first visit.  I have to change my review.  The service is great and the food is very good.  I've been eating the breakfast sandwiches which are priced right and generous in portions.  Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I read good reviews about Kiva's Bagle Bar and one of my neighbors told me that it was a good place. The entrance was very narrow, so I did not see seats, but there were seats. I ordered Tel aviv bagles a couple of times. Sometimes they are good, but other times they are not that good. Their sandwich is overpriced and I do not think they are good qualities. Not bad, but they are overpriced."}
{"text":"Kiva's has been a regular stop for me and my family whenever we visit Toronto.  The brothers who run it are as friendly and as welcoming as could be and treat everyone like they are VIPs.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  My kids love it and never let us leave town before stopping in for at least one breakfast or lunch.  Great bagels. Great food.  Great service.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The place has potential but it's really disorganized and the staff don't seem keen on helping patrons figure out where to go. The restaurant is also extremely small--too small for a neighbourhood like Deer Park that has a high volume of business people out and about at the same time for lunch.

I just had the soup to go and they couldn't even bother to put napkins or cutlery in my take away bag. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've only had their cookies and brownies, but wow -- amazing in every way! They are reasonably priced as well. If you are lucky, get their cookies when they come out fresh -- hands down the best cookies I've ever had"}
{"text":"I am a regular and I enjoy their bagels + the service is friendly.  I am particularly fond of the flat variety and love that they a decent amount of cream cheese without over doing it.  Also--nice to get capers. 

On a good day they remember how I like my coffee and everything goes swimmingly. Sometimes though, the coffee order gets mixed up which leaves me with cream--not milk.  Most of the time, I will go back and they replace it easily enough.  

Bottom line:  love the bagels, order the sweets, but double check your coffee orders."}
{"text":"Kivas is THE spot to go for hand rolled bagels in Toronto. The staff there are so nice and the bagels are incredible. My ONLY complaint is that although they also make amazing   fresh orange juice, on a few occasions the juice has definitely passed its prime and been rotten, my suggestion- if you are to get a fresh orange juice (and you totally should!) try it in the store just Incase!"}
{"text":"Lots of bagel options in Toronto. We love Kiva's. Be going to Kivas for many years. We also like What a bagel but still Kivas is the top in my books."}
{"text":"Worst service Kiva's location. After spending $41 on two bagel sandwiches, an avocado salad and two orange juices I was told I'd be charged extra for them to split the salad into two containers. She said they could do it if they weren't busy(there was one woman in line behind me)Then after leaving and getting back to my office noticed that they had forgot the sesame bagel that comes with the salad. After returning and informing them of their error the woman was irritated and didn't even apologize for the mistake. 


Better yet after sharing our experience with a colleague she still decided to go only to be accosted on her way out by an employee who hadn't realized she had already paid while her bagel was being prepared. 

The best part is that the our colleague was given Ben Rafaels card after sharing that she was in the marketing industry and before having to double check her banking transactions to in fact make sure she did pay.

Avoid."}
{"text":"Reading over previous reviews, I noticed a pattern: they get better over time - significantly so. 
I remember when Kiva's first opened a few years ago. Service was clumsy (not knowing what to put on a specific sandwich, taking a long time to butter a simple bagel, etc.) and they ran out of bagels a few times. 
But they quickly shifted gears and smoothed out any initial hiccups. Today, you can walk in during the morning or lunch rush and watch them churn out 20 bagel sandwiches in 5 minutes. 
They will regularly drop in complimentary rugalahs into your lunch bag, are generous with portions and toppings and make, yes, the best bagels in the city."}
{"text":"Can't get enough!!! Every time I come in, the people remember me and treat me like family. I often order the same omelette (goats cheese, onions and avocado!) that comes with a soft warm bagel. It really is comfort food for me, and I have loved everything I've ordered there. Not to mention, picking up a dozen bagels is so easy when I walk the dog because they have a window that opens to the street and lets me stand outside and order! My family and friends all come here frequently and we always leave happy!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Kiva's at the Bathurst and Steeles location (the original) and decided to give the Yonge and St. Clair a try as well to see if it's the same and comparable.  Without surprise, everything was perfect (in my opinion) like the original.

Although A LOT smaller in size (one is a restaurant and one is a Bagel Bar / Express) they still managed to keep the same taste and quality in their bagels, coffee, tuna (phenomenal), and egg salad.

I will definitely be frequenting this location a lot more since it's right across the street from my office."}
{"text":"This is more like it!! Kiva's Bagels are the closest approximation to New York bagels that I have found in Canada. They taste good! 

Also like: the tuna salad, the rugelah, and the people. Very friendly service, and they'll recommend items to you (they recommended the tuna and I agree!)

One of my colleagues ordered a bunch of bagels for a meeting and everything was good. Lots of varieties of cream cheese.

Sometimes they even give you a free rugelach with your sandwich! Nice!

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Flat bagels all dressed are wonderful, and they slice them so thet fit in the toaster. In fact all their bagels are great as is their cream cheese. But get there before 11--the flats sell out fast. Good, efficient staff."}
{"text":"I have been hitting up the Yonge and Eglinton location of Kiva's Bagels but they don't have a Yelp page.

The food is fresh and delightful! I loved the selection they have. Awesome bagels (0.95 cents!!) & cream cheese,great pastries,yummy traditional jewish foods, friendly staff. Great stuff :)"}
{"text":"What A Bagel seems to have a lock on the bagel market in the Yonge/Eglinton area. Kiva's is a fixture at Steeles/Bathurst and they're bringing their J-town cache to the goy. I like their twister bagels but I have to say they depart from the Montreal-style bagel that I know and love. Anyway, grab a bagel and head to a movie at the Silvercity."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying I've given this place 3 attempts. First time I came in I ordered a everything bagel sandwich. When provided with said bagel it tasted rather hard and stale... 

The second time I figured you know what maybe I was unlucky so I tried another bagel sandwich and again stale.

Finally I tried once more and got it in the early morning, mind you I did not eat it right away perhaps an hour later but once again... stale. I'm not sure if they are selling day old bagels or something as I never have this problem at bagel world or what a bagel but such is life. Anyways I did not rate it 1 star because at least the staff are nice enough and the soup was pretty good. 

Ps their slogan is Hand rolled bagels since 1979 ... more like tastes like it's from 1979..."}
{"text":"A busy place on the weekends and seats are very close to the other tables. Didn't get my right order from the server and had to stand in big line to pay for my bill. Bagels are delicious but this place is too pricey."}
{"text":"Small sized bagel sandwich, bland salads, modern decor, interesting service. 

When we first walked in we though we had to order at the counter but instead we were waited on which was nice. Waitress seemed lost in terms of items on the menu, as we first asked what types of bagels they had and she said \"ummm..I know we have sesame\". (It was around noon on a weekend and not too busy). 

Another table across from us was complaining about the amount of meat in his sandwich and the waitress turned around and ignored him.

Overall, the sandwiches themselves were very good but wished they were a bit larger."}
{"text":"Bagels are great but the people behind the counter don't listen to your order and you end up repeating your order over and over again for the repeated questions."}
{"text":"Love the cream cheese and lox. The bagel selection is impressive and they even offer gluten free.  Service can be a bit slow during the lunch rush, so you do need some patience. Take out only, restaurant is tiny (seats really close together too)."}
{"text":"The bad and the good:

The bad:
Service is all over the place.  Slow.  Gotta have a lot of patience or time to waste.  This is not a place for those on a tight schedule especially at peak times.  They had several people behind the counter - couldn't figure out who was doing what and for whom.  Now the really bad:   the man behind the counter was preparing sandwiches, picked up the phone, (with the same hand with which he was preparing sandwiches) and went back to the sandwiches with the same hand after using the phone.  Maybe the phone was clean, regardless, this, for me, was a major turn-off!  The blintzes were ludicrously overpriced!  Almost $15.00 for a few blintzes, are you kidding me?!

The good:
Bagels are acceptable.  Remember better experiences at Kivas on Steeles Avenue.  The VERY good was an alfajore cookie (I had the last one).  I am of two minds regarding this location.  Sorry, folks."}
{"text":"Lives up to all my lox cream cheese standards! Fresh bagels but pricey! Salivating as I'm writing this."}
{"text":"It has been a bagelful weekend. 

After a successful brunch at United Bakers, we decided to get a fix closer to home, at the Kivas at Yonge and St. Clair. 

This location opened last fall to great excitement among the Forest Hill crowd, many of whom remember trekking northward to the perpetually run-down bakery at Bathurst and Steeles. 

The Yonge and St. Clair Kivas fronts it's retail credibility. A sales counter holds refrigerated items like pre-packed cream cheese, tuna and egg salads, sodas and cloudy apple juice from Israel. They are joined by sweet baked goods, fine rugalach (which make a free appearance after the meal), and chocolate buffalo, which is basically a sweet, bready dough wrapped around insanely fudgy chocolate, and worth taking out on its own.  

The place is clearly geared towards take-out. People pop by for the bagel-cream-cheese-lox fix. However, at the back there is a sleek dining room with comfy benches and chairs, funky wainscoting on the walls (I haven't used the word 'wainscoting' since a Monty Python bender a few years ago), and modern light fixtures. The bathrooms reflect the trend towards unisex WCs, and shared sinks outside designed to shame everyone into hand washing compliance. Unlike uptown, they are clean. 

From a dining perspective, there are two Kivas. Bagels are unapologetically Toronto-centric. Dense, crusty-chewy rolls showered with poppy or sesame seeds. Pumpernickel  and marble flavors offend traditionalists mildly. Whole wheat and other atrocities are rightfully ignored. Bring home a dozen, with appropriate salads and toppings, and maybe a dessert or ten, and you've got the makings of a fine Sunday brunch. 

Eat in, and you're asking for trouble. 

Greek salad is a mound of fresh vegetables dusted with feta and not-greek-but-welcome-anyway eggs hard boiled to creaminess, olive-oil based dressing on the side. Chicken soup is a damning failure. A crock arrives, dominated by a single softball-sized and textured matzo ball. Chopped carrot and onion take up a good portion of the vessel. They've been added after the fact, and aren't properly cooked out. Weirdest of all, the soup is sour. We can't decide if it's from all the onion juice, or if someone threw a lemon or vinegar into the batch. Nobody gets sick, so we don't think the broth has spoilt. If a Kiva's representative would like to explain, I'd love to hear it. It's not my taste, but I'm curious whether it's a different cultural approach, or just lousy soup. 

Breakfast is most successful. A plate of lox, eggs and onions features slivers of fish and well-caramelized onions, with tomato and cucumber garnish, and a glorious toasted bagel dripping with butter. 

Coffee is stale and grey, initially served in a glass mug that highlights its stale-greyness (I hate glass mugs). When transferred to ceramic, it holds heat better, and if you get a pot immediately, it's OK.

Service is frustrating. Three people work the counter and restaurant simultaneously, so nothing gets done. Orders are mixed up despite fewer than five occupied tables. A tuna melt arrives as an ice-cold tuna congealed. It is grudgingly re-warmed. One one occasion, it arrives hot, but we are told that because we're late, there's no soup or salad to round out the $9.99 price set out in the menu. We're charged the full amount, even though they fail to deliver the whole plate. 

As a bagel bakery, Kivas deserves much more than it gets here. As a restaurant, it deserves much less."}
{"text":"This place serves pretty decent bagels.
What really draws me here is the lack of choice in the area for a quick morning breaky on Sat or Sun. Kiva's always seems to be open, and it helps that their staff is always extra cheery and welcoming!
They serve a variety of bagels with options of flat or extra twisty styles. I'd say the downfall is that a lot of items are pricer than you would anticipate but I would recommend a flat poppyseed with cream-cheese, regular poppy seed with lox or turkey & avocado, or the 3 egg + bagel option (with twisted poppyseed as the bagel option, obviously poppyseed is the way to go)!
worth a try if you're in the hood and itchin for a bagel!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kiva's a number of times, the quality and serving size is fanatic! I don't know if the women behind the counter was just having a bad day, but her attitude while serving today was nothing but rude and inconsistent with all of my other experiences. I won't likely ever return. It's a shame."}
{"text":"They're okay.  They've given me a quick option near work that doesn't involve copious amounts of cheese (I'm looking at you, pizza!)  Their soups are delicious & (supposedly) all vegetarian.  Their bagels are decent.  But their service?  Blech.

1st visit: I ordered a sesame bagel, toasted with egg salad to go.  5 minutes after my bagels toasts, the guy behind the counter realizes there isn't any egg salad left & tells me it will be a few minutes.  \"Never mind.\" I counteract (I had 30 minutes to get across town)  Just put some butter on it.  \"How about turkey or tuna?\" he pushed.  \"No thank you.  I'm vegetarian.\"  He offered me everything else in sight.  \"NO.  Just give me the bagel.\"

My coworkers raved about it.  I returned hesitantly, this time to dine within.  Being told my order would be brought to my table - I went & sat.  15 minutes later... (it was a toasted bagel with egg salad + soup)  I went to go track it down.  It had been sitting on the counter for the past 10 minutes, unnoticed by anyone by the counter.

The egg salad was on the side.  If I wanted egg salad on the side - why would I order the bagel in the first place?  Also, it was pretty bland.

Also, one of the workers (perhaps the owner?) was very forward.  Trying to make conversation & not picking up social cues & shoving free samples at people.  I don't want to try your cream cheese, okay?!

Basically if you want pushy & not very great service, this would be the place.  If you have your patience hat on - give it a try; their soup could be worth it."}
{"text":"I got a coupon for a free bagel at the new downtown location while walking around downtown. But since there is no Yelp page for the downtown location, I must say here that its the best bagel I've ever eaten.

Props!"}
{"text":"great spot for a morning coffee and a bagel. quick and friendly service and fair price for the area!"}
