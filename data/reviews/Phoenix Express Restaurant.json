{"text":"I go here about once a month for the lemongrass beef vermicelli. I am picky about Vietnamese because some of these places seem to use lousy cheap meat. Phoenix is good.  It's very casual but good for what it is; a place to sit down and get some good Vietnamese for lunch.  Service is quick and utilitarian. This isn't the kind of place you go for a dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work so we go sometimes at lunch. The vermicelli meals are really good, the pho is decent. The problem with this place is the service. Today was the third time in a row that the food took over 30 mins. to arrive. This is unacceptable for a downtown establishment during lunch time. Today it took 45 mins for a couple bowls of pho! The server was nice enough and apologized, however never acknowledged how long we were waiting until I complained to her. She said she would bring the manager by but the manager never showed up. Then when we got the bill I suggested perhaps it should be discounted for the long wait. She went to the manager and the manager comped it (finally), which left us feeling better about wasting our entire lunchhour waiting for our meal. Several tables were complaining and many people had to leave or request their meal to go as many had to get back to work. I get it, it's a busy place and who knows what the circumstances were - but at least warn or explain about any delays."}
{"text":"Great food, the staff is good.

I love the chicken and pork soup, # 16.

One of those hidden gems that's great to go and seek out."}
{"text":"This spot has pretty good Vietnamese food.  I can only comment on their vermicelli dishes and they were quite good.  This place is a little on the pricier end of Vietnamese food as well.  Lunch time is quite crowded, so I would recommend reservations if you can make them."}
{"text":"Overpriced, terrible service and mediocre food.

Our server was incredibly rude when we asked for separate bills. She became very flustered as we tried to pay and kept putting down my change and then taking it back. She even had the balls to ask me how much change I wanted back. I asked for it all and left nothing, which as a former waiter, is highly unusual of me. 

The food wasn't horrible, just different than I am used to I suppose. Since when does vermicelli have onions instead of cucumbers? The small portion of carrots in my meal were undercooked.

Most places offer chicken and spring rolls in the same dish, no such luck here. 

I'd rather pay 4 dollars less at ToA nearby for the meal I want. 

Never going here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten better Vietnamese food.  I say pass by this place.  

I just had their shrimp salad rolls and the hoisin dip was actually quite distasteful.  My friend had the pork, shrimp noodle soup and I asked him if he likes it, he said that it was OK."}
