{"text":"We were really blown away by the quality of the food here.  The portions are big, many items are made from scratch (including about 5 different kinds of homemade pierogis!), and the prices are cheap.  You can really tell the chefs take pride in what they serve.  I've never been to a dive bar with such awesome food."}
{"text":"Smoky but surprisingly not divey -- I like to think of it as the poor, well-scrubbed step-sister of Silky's. (Just roll with me.)

The drinks are cheap and strong, and the locals are friendly. It's the kind of place where families go, along with Bachelorette Party girls, along with Greenfield bro-types, along with retired millworkers. Lots of Nice Drunks who give freely the handshakes and the \"Eyyyyyy!\"

Their karaoke night, every other Saturday, is a bunch of fun due to the melting-pot nature of the clientele, where Right Said Fred rubs up against 50s boogie-woogie. The only downside to karaoke night is that the kitchen closes early because of it."}
{"text":"This is a small local Greenfield bar.  It has TV's, reasonable drink prices and some good food offerings, wings e.g.  I would call the bar a dive bar but it is friendly.  There is a nice jukebox and used to have karaoke.  It's a nice place for a quick stop to unwind."}
{"text":"Well, as of right now, Yesterday's has gotten rid of its karaoke. I'm super sad to see it go! Crossing my fingers that this will return in the near future - I'll be sure to update if it does."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews others gave, I thought this place would be great. I have never been more led astray by Yelp.

Background: I am 22, but I was trying to find something fun to do with some friends who were 19 and 20 and both from Europe. We had been turned away from other places for not all being 21 (which was a huge annoyance to the Europeans who have been going to pubs and bars since they were 16) and saw that this place had karaoke and thought we should give it a try. Outside the door was a sign that said \"Must be 18+ to enter\" so we thought we should be fine.

As we approached there was a dirty looking man pounding on a car. He seemed to be beyond wasted, but we figured he was probably just someone who had gotten out of hand and walked inside. The interior was dirty looking, and everyone at the bar seemed very drunk already (it was only 10pm on a Saturday) and no one was going near the karaoke machine. We were deciding if we wanted to stay and sit, when someone put his arm around me and one of my companions from behind us. It turned out to be the guy who had been pounding on the car outside. He asked us for our ID's and I asked if he worked there, considering he was not wearing anything official looking and smelled like stale beer. He informed us that he was the bouncer, and then insulted my friend by commenting that she looked to be about 15 years old. We all handed over our ID's and he left with them, returning quickly to tell us we were fine and to have a seat. We picked the nearest bar stools to us, and the bartender was with us immediately. We all ordered non-alcoholic beverages (coke, lemonade, water) and were about to start looking through the karaoke options when a man (I'm assuming the manager) came over. He asked how old we were, and we told him our ages. He said that since drinks were being served, we could not stay, even though we had ordered non alcoholic drinks and the sign outside said otherwise. I pointed the sign  out to him, and he seemed unaware of the markings on his own bar and asked us to leave. We ended up leaving without any drinks, feeling like our personal boundaries had been crossed and like we had been super insulted. 

I like a good karaoke bar as much as the next person, but this is NOT the place to go unless you like random men crossing your personal boundaries. It did not seem to be a safe place for women at all. Or for people who like to be clean. Don't go here. It's awful"}
{"text":"It's a smoking bar.  With food.  It's not fancy, but it is inexpensive. And there are pretty good choices, including burgers, pasta, wings and homemade dishes like meatloaf and pierogies.  I have eaten here a few times, and the portions are good for the price.  It's homemade as far as I can tell, and it tastes pretty good.  And the beer is cold.  And it's cheap.  And they have the game on.  
This is definitely a blue collar crowd.  And like I said, it is a smoking bar, and most of the clientele will be smoking at the bar, so if you can't stand smoke, this bar is not for you. 
They have a dart board, ATM, and jukebox there, but most of the times I've been there it was to grab a bite and a brew and watch either a hockey or baseball game.  Never had a problem with anyone there, and always got a good meal with a few cold brews and tip under $ 20.00. 
If you are in the area, stop in and try it.  It's really not all that bad!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Greenfield about 2 months ago and I'm pretty glad to have a little cheap dive bar right across the corner.  What all can you say about a dive? This is exactly what I look for - dim lights, cheap drinks and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"I deeply regret ordering from this place.  Everything was gross.  Just plain gross.  Their idea of chips is a 25 cent bag of potato chips. The wings were soggy, and the burger was soggy and drenched in half-\"carmelized\" onions."}
