{"text":"I like this place for many reasons.  It is a very interesting inside/outside bar that is different and I really like.  They have fire pits that are awesome.  They have a good selection of beer and the bartenders are very good and make sure everyone is taken care of despite large crowds.  I have even had (I believe) the owner or manager wait on me when it's been very busy and I really appreciate the effort for customer service.  What keeps me from giving this place five stars is the rudeness by bouncers and/or bartenders once it hits 2:00 a.m. on the dot.  Being screamed at to get out is pretty unacceptable to me customer-service wise.  I understand the liquor laws.  I work in this industry.  I know legally patrons can be in an establishment until 2:30 a.m. without penalty as long as alcohol is not purchased after 2:00 a.m.  I appreciate the fact that employees want to close up and go home.  But again, screaming at patrons at 2:00 a.m. to get out?  C'mon please have some basic customer service skills please."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend checking this place out. It has a super cool, open vibe. A great atmosphere for drinking in the summer! However, I did sadly give it two stars. The service wasn't great, but I don't think that's ever amazing when a restaurant first opens. Our drink orders were messed up but they then brought the correct order and didn't charge us. My main disappointment was the food. We ordered buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer and I was underwhelmed. I tried to order the Reuben as an entree but they were out of it. I then ordered a Chicken Cobb salad instead and the chicken seemed to be like shredded chicken out of can. It was a large portion but lacked freshness. The menu was also a bit confusing. Definitely looking forward to going back for beverages as they had some good beers on tap, but most likely won't be back for food."}
{"text":"A much needed and welcome addition to Mount Washington. Be sure to check it out if you are in the area.  My husband and I went early last Saturday night for dinner before a concert.  We were seated right away on the patio outside (also have a back patio with great views of the Pittsburgh skyline).  The drink menu has some great cocktail options as well as draft beers. I love that you can get 5oz beer samples for $3. They have a number of cider and sour beer options plus a great variety of summer seasonal beers.  My husband went with a shandy from Harpoon and I sampled a sour beer.   For my entr√©e I went with the burger which came with blue cheese, grilled apple and arugula.  They did not skimp on the blue cheese and with the apples it made the perfect combo.  I also love that you can choose your side and they have other options besides fries.  I went with the cucumber salad which was served in a mason jar and was pickled-so fresh and flavorful.  My husband got the fries with his burger topped with pork belly and they were fresh cut. We will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"Cool new spot. Lots of TVs, great view from the patio, great line up of beer and cocktails, and the appetizers are fabulous. This is going to be a go-to spot when the weather gets nice as they can open up much of the restaurant with garage doors. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite bar/restaurants in Pittsburgh, food is amazing, tons of beer. Staff is very knowledgeable and has a great vibe. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When traveling to Pittsburgh, my go to hot spot is Coughlin's Law Kitchen on Mt. Washington! They have a extensive food and beer menu full of creative New American dishes. Coughlin's is the perfect place to get together to share a meal or watch a game with friends and family. We came for a Pens game and ordered a bunch of items to share with the table. Some of our favorites were the Brussels, Fry Bucket, Wings, Bacon lollipops, The Coughlin's Burger and Crispy Chicken BLT. Our server was super knowledgeable and recommended some awesome beers and took us through the menu. I highly recommend Coughlin's Law Kitchen."}
{"text":"Can already tell this is going to be the go to spot this summer. We went there yesterday to watch the Pens game and it was packed! They were out of a lot of food because of how busy they are, which I will attribute to them being newly opened. Ashton was our server and he was great! The only thing that would make this place better would be allowing dogs on the patio area. Maybe in the future?"}
{"text":"Yasssss. So lit like season six of drag race. Next time all of the things. I want the braised collard greens, the sous vide hog max, and the broiled turkey necks. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Came here with friends to grab a drink and enjoyed the experience. Ever since this restaurant had opened, it has looked pretty full throughout the week with customers out on the patio, which is why we wanted to check it out. They have a great selection of beer and ciders, a variety that has something for everyone's personal taste. We didn't order any food, but looking through the menu they had some delicious sounding options. However the prices of food were on the higher side for a bar (appetizers were the same price as an entre). I enjoyed the casual atmosphere of the restaurant and the multiple tvs showing different sports. The patio area looked nice and would be great to go with friends on a summer day or night."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and had great drink specials. The staff is very friendly but there are a lot of issues we faced. First issue was we showed up at 2 pm to eat brunch. They closed the kitchen completely until 3. Ended up being 330 before we could order. They served other people when the kitchen was closed because they \"knew someone.\" My chicken BLT came without bacon and when I asked about it they said they ran out. A little bizarre considering it's called a BLT. I also tried to add cheese to my sandwich but they wouldn't allow additions or substitutions. Basically leaving money on the table in my opinion. The chicken was so fatty and inedible. I only ate the fries. I also ordered an orange crush and they ran out of OJ so I couldn't get that either. There are a lot of kinks they need to figure out. I'd highly suggest keeping the kitchen open all day and they need to be flexible with changes and substitutions on meals. They also need to figure out their inventory situation since they ran out of so much. Anyway, I'll be back to drink for the atmosphere will likely not eat here again."}
{"text":"With any new place, I don't focus on the service as I know they are working the process out.  That was the main downfall for me was the service wasn't great.   Food was good. My wife and I split a few apps.  It was good gastropub type food.    The beer selection on the menu was good but there were a few kicked kegs while we were there (my top 3 choices were kicked). But a lot of local breweries on tap which was great to see.   The atmosphere was really cool.  A lot of open space and outdoor seating, will be great when weather stays nice.   All in all, I was happy with it!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday. Seems they opened before they were even close to being ready. No one enjoyed their food- most notably, the baby food slop in a bucket that came out cold and borderline gray. Had a couple of orders of the steak and eggs. One steak was mostly fat, the second order's eggs were so overdone, it was like a cement slab of egg. Which they could have used to finish building the place, because half of the area was still under construction (detour around the heavy construction equipment). The fried pickles were so salty they burned. Maybe they can iron out the kinks but certainly have injured their rep by forcing an early opening. One member of our party had been to jail and claimed the food there was better. Good luck."}
{"text":"I used the waitlist option on here and I'm so glad I did, there was quite a wait when we got there, but we got seated right away.   We started with their bacon lollipops and they were sooooo good. Just the right amount, you definitely don't want to eat a lot of these in one sitting, but their sweet and spice levels were perfect.   I got the steak entree and I'm so glad I did. The steak was cooked perfectly. The sweet potato hash was unique, but not over the top. The blue cheese mouse may have been my favorite part, I'm asking for more next time!!   My husband got the pasta entree and it was soooo good. I said I would get that next time I went!"}
{"text":"Definitely a better bar than restaurant, and not by much. The space is really cool and great for good weather but the execution beyond that is not good. They offer 5 oz pours of their drafts so my plan was to get two 5 oz beers as I wanted to try both.. they were out of both. Our waiter was pleasant, but timing is bad, but I understand they are probably still working out the kinks. Food was average at best. Brisket nachos were ok, carnitas tacos were not good."}
{"text":"Go here often it's in my neighborhood... the food I hate wasn't the best but the venue is AMAZING... what a great view of the city! The bar area is huge with tons of drinks.. they have tons of garage doors and a covered deck out back with a view... u can drink outside in the front almost directly up to the street.. they have cornhole stations set up.. awesome neat different place that's whimsical and new.. always packed when nice out.. I get the fatheads bumbleberry and she got a strawberry basil.. ive also had the maple bacon old fashioned"}
{"text":"I went for their Sunday brunch and was happy to quickly get a table. The drinks were good especially the crushes.  However no one at my table enjoyed their entree. The only good part was the bacon lollipops.  I ordered the Huevos and was disappointed by the lack of flavor.  My eggs were underdone and brisket was dry.  Maybe they are still working the kinks out, but I will hold off on returning for now."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential and I hope that this eventually becomes a 5 star review.  The setup and atmosphere are amazing, especially for a nice day.  So much of the place is outside and the back deck has a great view of the city.  The bar is setup so you can sit either inside or outside which is a cool feature.  The staff was great to my group.  They were working so hard with how many people were there, but still found the time to answer a lot of our questions.  With great workers like this I'm sure this place will be even better once it gets past some initial growing pains.  In terms of the drinks there were a lot of different options.  Each of the different beers I tried were fresh and great.  Having said all of that, there are some things I thought they need to work on.  For food we ordered buffalo chicken dip and fish and chips.  The buffalo chicken dip was very disappointing.  It was essentially a thin mix of ranch and hot sauce.  The bread they served with it was great I will say.  We had this taken off our bill so no biggie, but I hope they have it fixed for next time.  For my meal I had the fish and chips.  The fish was cooked perfectly and I really liked the batter.  However, I was shocked that they do not serve tarter sauce with their fish and chips.  I don't think I have ever seen fish and chips without this.  They offer some other sauce, but I feel they should provide tarter as well.  The fries were fresh cut, but came out soft, too greasy, and definitely needed to be cooked longer.    Most of the issues with the place I think will be fixed as they get settled in.  With the great people working and the great atmosphere, I think this place will be a Mt. Washington favorite in no time."}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant/ bar on Mt.Washington.... a welcomed breath of fresh air for the area! Good food, extensive menu, great cocktails to suit everybody's taste. Staff was friendly and attentive, atmosphere was trendy. Great view of the city from the back patio. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Food is above average for the area Beer selection is excellent  Atmosphere is excellent Location is excellent Service is TERRIBLE!  The bartenders do a great job but God bless your patience if you get a table. The servers are so slow and get your drink orders wrong/mixed up. They either hired a bunch of terrible servers or they are severely understaffed. Either way, just come for the beers at the bar and order some food at the bar if you're hungry."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere, and the servers were so quick and accommodating. The food however was not all as good as it looked on the menu. We got the bacon lollipops... which were delicious. My husband and I got the Carnitas tacos and the brisket tacos which were lacking flavor. We also ordered the jalape√±o cheddar bucket of fries Which I thought would have come with a cheese sauce on top but instead came with a lot of jalape√±os and hardly any melted shredded cheese. I would go back due to the atmosphere, the good service and drinks but I do not recommend the food we ordered besides the bacon lollipops."}
{"text":"Coughlin's is definitely worth a shot. I met a group of friends on Saturday night (a week after opening I believe). We got to hang out outside while in line. The combination of the inside and outside atmosphere was awesome. We were sitting on the brick wall and a waitress came over to take our drink order while we waited which was much appreciated. They had an excellent draft menu. The food menu looked good and the food was good! I gave it three stars for the service and the fact they were running out of food at 8 o'clock on a Saturday night. I didn't rate it lower due to it being an extremely new place and obviously there will be kinks to work out. I had the carnitas tacos which were fine, but I wouldn't order again. The fried pickles were good as well. Looking forward to giving this place another try in a few months or so."}
{"text":"Horrible service had Felisha as a server and she gave us the check half way through our meal and said since you don't want anything else here is your meanwhile we had to ask for more water and we're planning on staying. It was embarrassing. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I met two of my girlfriends last night at Coughlin's Law and was excited to hit a new spot up in Mt. Washington. While, I love both Bigham Tavern and The Summit for food (and the Summit's cocktails), I'm not a huge fan of other casual restaurants in the area.   They had $5 mules as a special, I opted for a martini but my girlfriend got one and said they were really good. We decided to just order appetizers and share them. We shared kung pao shrimp,  pretzel sticks, fried pickles and brussel sprouts. The pretzels were stock frozen pretzels that were tasty only in the fact that pretzels are inherently tasty. The beer cheese and  whole grain mustard they came with were both good though! The kung poa shrimp was just fried shrimp with sweet thai chili sauce and peanuts on it. All in all tasty but nothing special. I honestly would have loved the pickles...they weren't overly breaded and they were thin and crispy. However, they were super super salty. I was pretty sad because they also came with a dill dip that was also really good. If they just didn't salt them after the fry, I think they'd be stand out for sure. The sprouts were probably my favorite! They were cooked really well and had a nice zesty lemon dip!  Plus I'm always happy to eat sprouts at a restaurant that aren't covered in balsamic and truffle (though i love those too).   Overall, it was a decent experience with a good bit of room for improvement! The staff was super nice and my server seemed a little nervous but it came off kind of charming. I am sure I'll be back again and maybe  my rating will increase!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so decided to check it out. The bar is real cool looking and a great location - like a gastropub. Looks like it should be located in Cali. We sat on the outside patio. I just got a water and ordered some food. I went with the BLT. It wasn't good at all. I figured it just be a fried chicken sandwich not that hard to mess up. The chicken was weirdly cooked like double fried or something. Couldn't even eat it. Fries were good though and their ranch so I ate that. I would go only back to grab some drinks at the bar but definitely not the food. I was disappointed also when I heard Carson City Saloon owns them because their food is AMAZING. Hopefully they work out the kinks soon."}
{"text":"I did order Cob Salad it was  Really good  and also a order Long Island  It was good too. My wife ordered tacos ,and it was good too."}
{"text":"First time to Coughlin's Law tonight. My fiance and I checked in via the Yelp app and were seated shortly after we arrived. While we waited we got a beer at the bar and were served promptly. Once we were seated on the back patio Olivia quickly introduced herself and reviewed the specials with us. She was attentive and personable throughout the night, even while dealing with two 25 tops back to back in the dining room. She and the other server on the patio, Cheyenne, took turns checking on each other's tables. In addition, the food was delicious and they have a great beer list full of locals. Olivia did such a great job that we stopped to check in with the manager on our way out. Great food, even better service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the berry sangria and nibbled on some food that my friends ordered. All around tasted good and I really enjoyed my drink. There were a lot of servers working, a mix of tables to accommodate bigger and smaller parties, and there was a good ambiance. I would come back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Service: Decent, the waiter took awhile to come take our orders. But the food was served very quickly.  Food: presentation is very good. Taste is good. But the prices are too high. They should take a few dollars off each meal.  Drinks: very well mad and bar service was fast even with the bar being full. However, we went on a night where it was advertised as $5 mules all day Thursday but they didn't keep those prices because of a hockey game."}
{"text":"Coughlin's Law could double as a funeral home. Pricey drinks, slow service, and silence combine to create an environment and experience similar to a war prison.  Save your money and drink literally at any other location on this earth and you're guaranteed a better time. Start the movement, #CloseCoughlinsLaw. Corn bread is ite tho."}
{"text":"I came here tonight for a friend's birthday. They have a great outdoor area where we were all able to congregate and get drinks at the bar. When we got there, a manager told us that we would be getting a waitress. We waited about twenty minutes to order a drink because we had already been introduced to her. I ended up ordering our drinks and food at the bar because she never showed up. The rest of the night went really smoothly and we didn't have to wait very long at the bar to order drinks. I would absolutely return again soon if I am in the area."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  My husband and I went with 2 friends around 7 on Friday night.  It was crowded outside with a bunch of frat boys drinking beer.  We were seated immediately and our service was very fast and friendly.  We had the maple old fashioned and it was ok, Jim Beam is not the best.  We also had some beers and got the chips as an appetizer which were pretty good.  I got the burger with onions and it was prepared perfectly and was delicious.  My husband got the smoked burger and the presentation was very cool and he said it was pretty tasty.  Our friends also said their food was great.  I am only giving this place three stars because it's nothing new and it was really loud.  I'd go back during a non-peak time."}
{"text":"If you want a restaurant that is steps away from a fantastic view of Pittsburgh, then you've found it. Looks like street parking is your only option here. For a late night visit on a weekday there were actually quite a few people there. Plenty seated around the bar area which opens to an outdoor seating area. They didn't have any balcony seating available, they had a large party over in that area so we were seated at a table. Our server was actually really nice, he checked on us many times. They were also good about keeping the table cleared of empty glasses and plates which I like. My problem was that our table was consistently being dripped on(condensation) by the overhead a/c exposed ductwork. No, we didn't ask to be moved because honestly for most of the meal I think we though it was just moisture from the water glasses on the table . Wednesday night was $5 wines/cider/sangria night. I decided on the grilled Caesar salad and a sangria. I have to say I was very surprised when the salad came, not at all what I was expecting. I'm not saying it was a bad thing, but I believe that the menu should describe what you're getting so you aren't shocked when it comes. It was 2, what I would consider small, grilled romaine lettuce leaves with Caesar dressing, anchovies and parmesan and a huge piece of grilled bread. The bread I believe was supposed to be garlic toast and I didn't get any garlic flavor, but it was good and a nice addition to the salad. The salad was actually delicious, the crispy anchovies were fabulous. My only problem is that it was Very small and I wasn't expecting it prepared that way since the menu did not say that. The sangria was good, pretty weak, but that's what I expect these days at every restaurant with daily drink specials! Overall it was a good experience, is probably come back, and hopefully get a chance to sit out on the balcony."}
{"text":"I follow Coughlin's on Instagram. During a long day of studying, they posted their Thursday $5 moscow mule special. Luckily, I am not the only one who follows their instagram page and convincing others to join was easy. It was my first time to Coughlin's and it was perfect for what I was looking for last night. A nice, relaxing evening outside, sipping on a wonderful Moscow Mule with the friends, that I not only came with but then others that we ran into upon our arrival. Our waitress, Cheyenne was a great and stayed on top of things as more people joined and the Moscow Mules were a fan favorite. I stuck to the traditional, but they have a wide selection including jalape√±o, basil, peach and berry. We will definitely be going back. Good news, their instagram promotes a different special every night."}
{"text":"Good service, cool atmosphere, tasty drinks, but don't plan on eating here...  Came to Coughlin's thinking the brunch menu looked delish, but the food was disappointing.  If I was rating on the chicken & waffles and breakfast bucket alone, I would give it 0 out of 5 stars. Just go for patio drink. Recommend the bloody Mary or the crushes!"}
{"text":"So we came on day 3 of being open. So obviously, they still need to work out the kinks. First, I want to say how nice and friendly everyone who working this Sunday brunch was. The managers and bartenders really made our experience pleasant!  It's very nice inside and I love the decor. They even have purse hooks and outlets at the bar! A few things were a little messy, but of course things are probably crazy because they are sooo new!  They have a lot of hands on deck and it seems they make teamwork an important part of their philosophy which I really love!  So how about they had an AWESOME vegan chickpea and sweet potato burger with yummy sweet potato fries. The food was nice and hot and plated nicely. My friend had the soft pretzels and she said they were decent, obviously just your standard pretzels but who cares, sometimes simple is great!  I look forward to coming back when it's warmer out and seeing how great they are doing!"}
{"text":"Headline / TL;DR version - I recommend you go here for the vibe and drinks, especially when you can take advantage of the front and back patios.  Go somewhere else for food.  Ambiance - 4.25/5 Drinks - 4/5 Food - 2/5 Service 3.5/5 Value - 3/5 (4/5 during Happy Hour)  As a resident of Mount Washington, I can say that Coughlin's Law is a welcomed and complementary addition to the neighborhood's restaurant & bar scene.  Overall, the owners did a really nice job with the concept, especially with the open layout that leverages two outdoor spaces - the large front patio and the smaller back patio that overlooks a piece of the Pittsburgh skyline.  The ambiance is probably my favorite part of Coughlin's Law, and something that is unique enough that it alone will bring me back.  I like their drink menu as well.  It's beer forward; Coughlin's Law has more draft selections than anywhere in Mt. Washington and they do a good job of keeping their website up to date.  However, my first drink was not a beer, it was a Maple Bacon Old Fashioned to take advantage of their $6 cocktail special during Happy Hour.  It passed the test!  The drink had the right amount of maple / walnut flavor (it was still whiskey forward) and came with a very good maple bacon \"lollipop\" on a toothpick.  You can't go wrong with this drink, and this is coming from someone whose favorite drink is an Old Fashioned and expects greatness when I order one.  Sadly, the bacon lollipop was BY FAR the best food item I had.  To sum up my opinion of the food, I think the intentions are good but the ingredients and execution are not.  My friend and I started with the Chips & Beer Cheese ($7, but $5 during HH), and when the chips are better than the dip, you know you're in trouble.  The beer cheese just lacked flavor.    For my entree, I ordered the Crispy Chicken BLT , and when it came out, it looked great.  However, the batter was very thick & saturated in oil and the chicken was remarkably thin, so it was mostly a batter sandwich.  The romaine lettuce garnish was all stalk and no leaf, and I took most of it off my sandwich.  Finally, the arugula pesto was good but barely there, and more was really needed to add some depth to the sandwich.   The service was as expected and checked the box.  It took a few minutes to be greeted but the hostess was friendly and accommodating.  The server was prompt, attentive, and friendly as well.  Overall, I'm happy that Coughlin's Law is open and will be a regular visitor.  For now though, it will just be for drinks."}
{"text":"I agree with previous posts. Tons of potential, has some growing pains to work through.  Pros: pleasant staff. They are hard working and it was BUSY. Engaging, hardworking. No complaints. They also have a great outdoor scene with plenty of space. And HEATERS!! Overhead heaters that made it tolerable to sit outside when it was chilly. You win on that one. Lots of great beers, too. Good selection broken down on the draft list by types, which is helpful.  Cons: process. The wrong draft list was on our table. They have a number system for their beers, so a \"13\" was actually an \"18\" because an old list was floating out there. And because the person who got it drank about half before he said something, we were charged for the mistake. Food. It's just okay. Pretzels were so-so, nachos were just not good. They need to take more pride in presentation and a lot of that could be resolved.  It's a cool place and will likely be well attended for the area it's in. I'd go back in a while when they get into their groove."}
{"text":"I was very happy to get a great table on the front porch with my 2 friends.  The atmosphere was friendly and our food was delicious.  I had the vegan burger and cucumber salad, my friends had the paparedelle (pasta) with shrimp and they both liked it.  Our drinks were well done and too.  The only thing, and I hate to say anything negative because I live here and the place has been packed every day and night so far; (I think my niece and her friends are already regulars there) but the \"Seasonal\" dessert was the worst thing I've ever paid for.  We told our waitress and showed her the hard Brownie served with melted ice cream (called an ice cream sandwich).  Evidently she didn't know how to handle it, so  she just went ahead and charged us  for them. We let it go cause it was so cheap.  I  won't go into detail, I just hope the manager comes up with a replacement that is edible before we get too far into the Season!  Wishing you continued success!"}
{"text":"We heard great things about this place so we gave it a try.  It's has a great vibe and the weather was perfect for them to have their garage doors open.  We had about a 30 minute wait so we went to the bar and grabbed a drink.  The bartenders were nice and attentive but they made my 2nd drink wrong which was a one cause for not having 5 stars. We ordered two drinks each while we waited for a table and the same bartender made my drink wrong the second time after I reconfirmed what I was having.  I didn't complain.    Our waitress was awesome and perfect from start to finish.  I had the Mix and match tacos which you get to pick 3 out of the 4 tacos and my friend got the Cobb salad.  We split jalape√±o cheese fries and the salted Carmel ice cream sandwich which wasn't actually a sandwich but it was AMAZING.  My tacos were good, the fries were made with cheap cheese which got hard fast. They were...okay and my friend really enjoyed the salad.    Overall it's a cool spot for drinks and some appetizers but it's just an above average place with some bar food."}
{"text":"First visit to this new, awesomely located, hip bar/eatery - pub in Mt. Washington. First impression is a staff and definatley a management that seems a bit stressed out already. That's all good. It's new. But let me tell you that the best places on Mt. Washington give the Best service and are Always friendly (see Bigham Tavern). Seems like a lot of hires are new to the bar game, I see empty plates and glasses everywhere on the bar, and around the tables. See people waiting for service when there's four to five people behind the bar. Again, it's new and people are spinning with all the new things to do to impress the owners. Understood. First visit.   Menu items, small menu, some are not available or sold out. Wanted the Cuban. What I did get was quite good. Breakfast Tacos. Price was a tad high since half a block down two eggs, bacon, and pancakes with hash costs $6, but the presentation was excellent!!! and the food was very delicious. Save the hash, over salted, couldn't eat it. I said as much.   Atmosphere is on point, menu looks fresh and hip, beers and drinks (specialty ones too) are flowing and the patio/bar is excellent looking. Whole place looks fantastic. Tiny kitchen, feel a tad sorry for those back there. Great build-out altogether. Congrats. Will be back several times I hope. Can only get better."}
{"text":"Just went there tonight for the grand opening -- LOVED IT! I was expecting some bumps or mishaps as it was the first night open to the public, but just the opposite. Everything was wonderful! Our server, Cheyenne, was so helpful, attentive, and welcoming. Ask for her if you stop in. She was So knowledgeable of the menu already. The menu has many choices- great apps, salads, tacos, burgers, and a few entrees. We ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts and some wings to start. So delicious! My husband got the coughlins burger which came under a smoked cloche. So cool. I got the Caesar  salad with chicken - also delicious. It came on a grilled romaine. No too overdressed or soggy like some Caesars. The prices were very reasonable as well. The cocktails and drink lists were extensive and had something for everyone. After dinner we hung out on the patio and bar area. One suggestion I do have is that the bartenders seemed so swamped -- they need a better system for making the drinks. All of the ingredients for cocktails were all over the bar so all the bartenders were rushing around bumping into each other just trying to make one drink. They should come up with a better bar system. I don't think it was their fault though, and they were all very nice and made good drinks. Otherwise though, everyone was personable and created a great atmosphere. I love that mount Washington finally has a cool place with city views and space to hang out. I would recommend this place to friends or families looking to relax and hang out, people looking for a good food and good prices. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Last evening we had a work dinner and heard about this new place on Mount Washington. The three of us went hoping we could sit on the patio with the killer view of the city. We only had to wait a few minutes for a spot there, and the waitress came along quickly. We never got her name but she had a blunt cut blonde hair above her shoulders and dark framed glasses with forearm tattoos - she was awesome. She got us drinks and they beer selection was great. We had the blossoms and lollipop bacon for appetizers. Super tasty. I ordered the Coughlin's burger and asked for it well (sorry, I hate pink). It came out perfectly. My two colleagues also loved their meals. We spent about three hours there hanging out, making jokes with the waitress, spending money on more drinks, and just having a really great time. I'll be back for sure."}
