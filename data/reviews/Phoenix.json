{"text":"Great food, amazing service accepts all credit cards and debit cards. Food was great and fresh the shrimps were large and the black pepper beef was lit bill for two was $35 which is reasonable"}
{"text":"I am just this moment enjoying take-out Coconut Soup from Phoenix. I asked for reduced salt, and was accommodated with ease. The soup is absolutely delicious - fresh and perfectly spiced - and loaded with perfectly cooked chicken and shrimp.  You know that honeymoon phase you sometimes have with a restaurant you've never tried before? Well, so far I am committed to a long-term relationship with Phoenix. My only regret is that I have lived so close for eight years without knowing about this gem.  Scarborough is a haven for wonderful small eateries, and Phoenix is one of the very best. Thanks, Phoenix, for your delicious and inexpensive nourishment. I feel very lucky to have found you!"}
{"text":"The chicken pakora was very mediocre, wasn't crispy on the outside,  moist on the inside.  The Thai green curry was very good though. The service was excellent too"}
{"text":"I was inspired by other reviews to try Phoenix and I was not disappointed! The place is clean with a nice atmosphere, despite its strip mall location. They have a whole vegetarian section in the menu, so ordering for me was east. I recommend the onion pancake as an appetizer. I've had this in many Chinese restaurants and this was the best by far. Many places buy them frozen and then deep fry them before serving. As you can imagine, they tend to be greasy. These had a much nicer texture. They were and seemed to be homemade and pan fried-not greasy at all! For my entree, I had the Vegetarian Delight and ,as the name suggests, it was delightful! Great portion size and perfectly cooked. I will definitely return here next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant  based on yelp reviews, and was very disappointed....  Spec fried rice bland and too muck fake crab...Szechuan beef... Not sure if it was beef and very watery and wrong kind of hot.... Chicken wings were old...   I could go on..... The people seemed nice, from phone manner and delivery guy was very nice .... Shame about the food..."}
{"text":"Cheap, mediocre Chinese food in a clean restaurant run by nice, attentive people.   Our high Yelp-review-based hopes for the place faltered a bit when we saw the tables set with knives and forks....and our hopes sank a bit more when our request for chopsticks was answered with the cheap wooden takeout variety...but we gave it a go to see what the Hakka style was all about.  We tried a variety of starters and shared a Hakka main. All in all, everything was perfectly mediocre, and generally either bland or too sweet.   Mango salad: Not bad, but I found the sugared peanut topping to be gritty and unnecessarily sweet. Onion pancakes: Okay...nothing special.Much thinner and flatter (and less oniony) than what I've seen in other places.  Manchurian style chicken: Deep fried and covered in a thick sauce. (Menu fail: We didn't expect - and really didn't want - deep fried.) Masala fried rice: Heavy on the frozen veggies, light on flavour.  If you're used to Chinatown fare and looking for that great little place in an obscure strip mall, keep on looking!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Have had thin rice noodles with chicken and shrimp, thai spring rolls, mango salad, chicken wings and chicken with veggies. Everyone has happy with the dishes ordered.  The fried items were crispy even though they were delivered. Delivery takes about 40 minutes it's better to pickup, your food is ready in about 10 minutes from the time you order. Our family's favorite"}
{"text":"This place is still as great as the first time I described it. The new servers are just as friendly as the old ones and the food is consistently great.  They have recently improved their front entrance to help for the coming winter months you now have a landing area and you have to go through two doors instead of the way it was set up before. They have also painted the walls recently."}
{"text":"The chicken tandoori naanwich was great, even if the price was a little high (9$) for a regular size sandwich. The sauce and the chicken's juice/sauce were amazing, something to try!"}
{"text":"Based on previous reviews of this place, I was expecting to be wowed. Realistically, this is an Asian restaurant in a strip mall.   There are, however, several good things to be said about it:  The service is very friendly and fast, perhaps even too fast, as they removed the dipping sauce before my partner had finished his spring roll.   Yes, this place is definitely nice and clean.   Now to the food.   The crispy beef is crispy, but that actually made it kind of hard to chew. It was almost like jerky, in fact. You can taste the garlic and a hint of spice, but generally it was pretty bland.   Shanghai noodles were bland as well, and almost gluey.   The worst thing by far, though, was the coconut soup, which  was watery and except for a hint of coconut, was virtually tasteless.   The spring rolls were fresh, hot and crispy, but suffered from the same tastelessness.  I'd like to give this place the benefit of the doubt and suggest that the regular chef had already gone home for the evening. I have no idea if that's true, but it's the only explanation for why our food experience was so different from previous reviewers.  It's not likely we will head back here."}
{"text":"I was on the way home from the airport and was so hungry and craving noodles, soup and veggies. Searched \"Asian\" on here and found this place had good reviews. They were so right. The service was friendly, the place was clean and warm (the staff member shut the door to the outside as I chose a seat right beside the door). The wonton soup came first and it came quick, it was perfectly heated and tasted very good. Then The cucumber salad came and it was equally perfect. I was able to eat half and bring half home with me. Then, the perfect amount of time later, my pad Thai came and it was delicious. I ate half and brought that home too. All for $25 including tip. I wish I lived closer and this would be my go to place. Unfortunately in bowmanville we have nothing like this. I will totally recommend this place and hop to go back. Maybe the next time I'm visiting my parents in Scarborough."}
{"text":"this place is pretty outrageously good.  some of the most on point, authentic, chinese fine dining i've ever experienced.  it makes you feel like a high roller from Macao to go here.  there are dishes like bird's nest soup and shark fin soup that i've only heard of but never dreamed of consuming.  to be fair, there are of course \"normal\" dishes by western estimations that are quite approachable and executed precisely.  their beverage program is pretty robust too - high end wines & spirits of every kind.  definitely an amazing experience, i'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good flavour, generous portions and good service. The only reason I just gave a 3 was both the chicken in the hot and sour soup and the chicken in the pad Thai was tough and chewy. I got the leftover soup to go and heated it for about 15 minutes the next day on low heat thinking it might make the chicken more tender but it was still tough. That grossed me out a bit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I went there because of all the amazing Yelp reviews, and I have to say, for all the fuss, this restaurant is definitely not overrated.  This is quite literally the cleanest Asian restaurant I have ever been to. The waiter is amazing. We went back a second time and he remembered us, and exactly what we ordered. He's very friendly but doesn't intrude too much.  We started out getting some of the food recommended on here, and then strayed. Haven't had anything I didn't like at this restaurant, to be honest! But if I had to choose a favourite, I'd pick the Stir Fried Ho-Fun Noodles. They're amazing.  Definitely go check this place out if you're in the area. As for my husband and I, we're now regulars."}
{"text":"Unbelievable, authentic, superior to every Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas and probably the US. Do not miss out if you are looking for quality."}
{"text":"We ordered three different entrees: the Crispy fried pork was wonderful and I will definitely order it again.  The tenderloin entree although expensive was also top notch.  The filet of beef was cooked perfectly but was lacking a little bit in the seasoning.  We did order the smoked Chilean Seabass but they were out of it.  My only complaint is that the menu online does not resemble the menu in the restaurant.  We had selected some dishes online that we were going to try but they were no longer on the menu.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese dim sum here!   I liked the baked bbq pork buns, the shrimp rice rolls, the XO shrimp dumplings, gingko + peashoots, and their soups are excellent!   Their XO sauce is really yummy.   Service is above and beyond. Decor is elegant. We were in a private room with its own private bathroom.   Highly recommend this place.  Update:   I had the Dungeoness Crab Meat with Egg White.... OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Absolutely perfect! The egg white omelette stir fried with fresh crab meat is so flavorful, great to eat with some rice. The dish was the favorite of the entire table!   Must-try!"}
{"text":"Really good food! I never heard about this place until I saw the yelp reviews. I would say this Hakka food is on par with lucky and federick or maybe even above. The food was excellent, no complaints whatsoever even for take out. The man I ordered the food from gave me recommendations for chilli chicken and manchurian chicken. Since the recommendations were a common Hakka specialty I decided to go for something different. I ordered the beef ho fun, and masala seafood fried rice, extra spicy for all! Server was really friendly and stated that I would like the food better than lucky or federick. I came back home and took a plate of both dishes and was satisfied with the food quality. It had a fresh and homemade taste in them, I'm pretty sure there wasn't other additives but fresh ingredients. Highly recommended and may be one of the best Hakka Asian fusion cuisine out there!"}
{"text":"This place has become a regular! I tried this place about 2 years ago and was a little apprehensive at first. After the great experience we had, I recommend this place to everyone. The staff have got to be the nicest staff I've ever had at a restaurant (even when I was new to the establishment.) - which is the icing on the cake.  The food is amazing as well!! Some of my personal favorites are: - Chilli chicken  - Potatoes and okra - Hot Garlic Fish - Thai Mushroom Soup - Chicken Pakora  This restaurant is worth a try...but is dangerous because you will want to go back again and again. Thank goodness it's fairly priced!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a second time and I'm so dang please with how fresh the food tastes. I had a vermicelli soup and I ordered everything with shrimp, chicken and beef and boyyyyy was it worth the extra to add some of them in. I ordered a mixed vegetables with shrimp, chicken and beef as well and plain white rice all I can say is OMG. How fresh their food taste and how large the shrimps are is just wowzers. The beef is large as well and everything is extremely tasty. I could eat here everyday. I've been feeling for fresh tasting food and this restaurant hits the spot at all times. Will continue ordering from here. They are officially my favourite place to eat. One day I'm going to have to eat in to check the place out :)"}
{"text":"Great food with reasonable price, love the new menu. Love the Duck Wrap and ribeye steak! Dragon Breath is amazing! Also got the 20% local discount, even better."}
{"text":"I will start by qualifying this review and saying that this is a popular local Pan-Asian take out food spot with dishes in the $10 price range. Those looking for authentic, high end Asian cuisine - look elsewhere. Those looking for value and decent food, read on. Strangely, considering how many times I've eaten here, I never reviewed it before. This last trip was with the family, so 6 of us took a table inside as opposed to doing the takeout thing. The menu has options ranging from forms of Chinese to Thai and Hakka, so it has many bases covered. The food is pretty good for the price, which is why there are so many return customers. If you eat in, the service is efficient, though not the most friendly, as the guy serving is taking the phone orders and also lending a hand in the kitchen. I have lots of regular dishes, but i like to mix it up with something new every time. I've been here so many times I've almost tasted the entire menu. If I had to pick my favourite it would probably be the Prawn with Lobster Sauce - they use unusually large prawns for a dish at $15. Like everyone else in the neighbourhood, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I live in Waterloo, but whenever I come home, this is the first restaurant I visit. Lunch specials are fantastically priced, good portions, great service, will continue eating here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect, but we were exhausted after a crazy long week. We ordered the mango salad, Manchurian Beef, Almond Chicken and Egg Rolls. The salad and mains were delicious! The egg rolls were fine, as well. The delivery came when expected and the food was piping hot. We are interested to try some more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'd lived in downtown Toronto for the past 20+ years and i recently moved to Scarborough. Feeling a bit unsure about food in this area, I was completely surprised to find Phoenix the first day we moved in!  The food was very flavourful and not greasy at all, unlike most Chinese takeout places. There was no sign of overusing corn starch in sauces and marinated meat and that is rare. And nothing was over battered. I know I will keep going back for food.  I am Chinese from Hong Kong and I can honestly say that this is as close to home cooking as you can get. Perhaps those who did not enjoy the food wanted the typical greasy Chinese takeout food. Phoenix definitely gets 5 stars from me!!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers took me here for the first time.  This place is incredible, not only in terms of quality and service, but also price!  The food is delicious! We ordered off the vegetarian menu and were not disappointed. The service is warm and friendly. The staff took the time out to talk to us and tell him about his experiences.  Overall, a fantastic place and one that is on my \"Must Visit\" list if I'm in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"J'avais déjà entendu parlé du pain Naan, et j'ai eu l'agréable surprise de trouver des naanwiches dans ce truck.   J'ai goutté celui au porc braisé .. un seul mot d'ordre une tuerie. Je l'ai dégusté jusqu'à la dernière miette/goutte de sauce.  Les gars/filles sont cool et le service à été rapide même si c'était un first friday."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the reviews and the score of this restaurant is HIGHLY overrated. Came here with four friends thinking that it would be a really good place but once the plates landed on our table I had a little chuckle and thought I was in for a treat.   We ordered the mango salad, garden salad, egg roll, Manchurian beef, stir fry beef ho-fan, salt and pepper beef, chilli chicken, salt and pepper deep fried squid, veggie fried rice and a vegetarian delight tofu dish.   So the food came in a timely manner and the service was good. The mango salad was really good as well as the chilli chicken but any of the beef dishes didn't taste well. The beef was really really chewy felt awful cause all I wanted was to stop chewing. The tofu dish wasn't good just got it to go and chucked it lol. The squid was decent but overall not the best Hakka Chinese food at all. Wouldn't go back again as I have a roster full of much better \"Shitty Chinese\" food places."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the view and warm welcome by the staff. The menu has been recently changed and they added  more options to choose from. The Ribeye was so juicy along with an amazing selection of Dim-Sum that filled me up. My friend had a Seafood pasta dish that had shrimp scallops and clams that was also very tasty.  The egg sugar puff dessert was so tasty and went perfect with a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They are fast and they serve fresh dishes that are thai, hakka, and chinese. I always order their Manchurian Chicken or their Chili Chicken. Its the best. They also have a lunch special depending on what you order on the menu each lunch item's total is either 6.50 or 5.95 that comes with rice, main dish, soup, egg roll, and pop. They also take the time to talk to their patrons and I think its to get to know what they are into so they can recommend something else on their next visit.  On my most recent visit it wasnt during lunch time special but I had their ginger chicken ask for dry...as a recommendation by one of the staff. It was very delicious it was crispy, not saucy, coated in i guess a ginger based powder then deep fried or just fried but honestly you just have to try it. If your looking for something more saucy maybe ask for it not dry...I also ordered beef fried rice and that combo was good (I usually get Chicken fried rice but it probably would have felt like overkill chicken on chicken) hehe   Anyway if you want really good food, cooked fresh, and inexpensive I recommed this place, highly.  Clean restaurant, clean washroom, the appearance of the staff is also clean.  Parking is available infront and usually always has empty spots. The staff here are also welcoming and polite."}
{"text":"Very nice food and wonderful people! I always get the vegetable pad Thai and it has the same great taste every time."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! It's nice to visit a restaurant that is clean and airy. You're not sitting too close to people next to you.   The food was amazing! It was our first experience with Hakka. If you're worried about the food being too spicy, don't be. The food is flavour forward with some heat.   The service was prompt and courteous and the food didn't take too long to be served.   I'd definitely go back without a second thought. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is beautiful and quiet, you are able to enjoy a nice conversation while admiring the décor. I had the scallops with shrimp, bacon and asparagus and the beef fried rice. It was absolutely delicious. I also enjoyed the Wolf cocktail, which was strong to my liking.  The service was excellent, very attentive and courteous. They made my Admin Day very special. Thank you Lucky Dragon."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed if you try this place out.   I have to admit I am a bit of a regular here, but that is mostly because it is cheap and delicious. While I am there it seems that everyone else who walks in the place is also a regular. This place is so good it keeps people coming back.  While there are lots of things to gloat about, one of the highlights is definitely the service. The waiter is always the same. He is awesome with a great memory and will remember what you ordered to events in your life (if you care to share them with him).   While this is an ethnic place, with authentic food you can find something for everyone. I come from a large family and even my little picky-eatting brother likes the food here.  Some of my personal recommendations are: 1 - Crispy beef for the meat lovers 2 - Okra and potato for the veggie lovers 3 - Manchurian sauce and any of the dishes that come with it.  4 - Onion pancakes - they are great to share as an appetizer.   Other great things about this place: 1 - Cleanliness 2 - The dishes are made from fresh ingredients. Even the filling in the spring rolls was cut up the same day you eat it.  3 - Parking is available 4 - It is on Kingston Rd, so it is easy to get to.  5 - The guava candy that you get at the end is yummy.  6 - You can get take-out.  Hope you enjoy this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"Seems to be less popular than the resteraunt next door that shares the same hostess. The menu next door seemed a lot better but had a 30 min wait vs no wait. It was Relatively quiet Saturday night. The menu itself is rather small, but filled with great dishes. We got the duck wrap, seafood Stevie, kimchi fried rice, jumbo prawns, and one of each dessert.  The duck wrap was delicious. Great taste with a spicy kick at the end. Seafood Stevie was very light, I wish it would have had a bit more flavor. Jumbo prawns were... Well... Jumbo. Great taste cooked perfectly. Kim chi friend rice was done as you'd expect. The desserts were also delicious. In order (best to worse) my favorites were there the mochi ice cream, then the mango pudding, and then the cream puff.  The food for the most part was above average, but why this place really gets 5 stars is because of it's service. We admittedly had an obnoxious group of 6, but the wait staff was beyond friendly, patient, and accommodating. The main server was also training and I believe the resteraunt's service will be in good hands going forward."}
{"text":"This is my new fav place for Indian-Chinese food. They're friendly, they'll custom make your order, they are really good with customer service. The food is delicious (they under-season the food a little; but then again, you can always season it to your preference right!). And yeah, the food is plenty and the bills are tiny. Which is why my group left a pretty nice tip. We were 4 of us and our bill was just over $50. Stuffed to the top!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is without a doubt my favourite restaurant in Scarborough.  The employees are very friendly and knowledgeable, the pricing is very good, the food is absolutely delicious, and the portion sizes are more than fair.  Waistline permitting I would eat here several times a week!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the good reviews of this food truck I tried them today! And I'm glad I did! I ordered the Tandoori Naanwich and potato salad with homemade ice tea to wash it down. The naanwich was $9, potato salad $6 and ice tea $3. A total of $18 - which is too expensive if you ask me. There should be a combo with a price point of $15 max. The tandoori naanwich was really good - I would order that again in a heart beat. It had chicken, raita, cucumbers, coriander and a load of pickled, shredded spicy carrots. The naan itself was warm and chewy. I really enjoyed the naanwich. The potato salad was...not...very...good. At all. It was really over dressed, more like soup really. The topping, which I think was supposed to be bacon, was pale like chicken. It looked like the colour of roasted turkey but had the fat and fried appearance of bacon - but it definitely wasn't turkey bacon... There was the odd piece of pickle which was good. I wish there were more pieces of pickle, way less dressing (like a quarter of the dressing) and none of the mystery topping. The potatoes themselves were an odd consistency once in a while. Anyway, the salad was a complete miss for me. The iced tea was ok - I wouldn't order it again for $3 - maybe if it was $1."}
{"text":"A meal at this restaurant is more than just a dining experience, it's an enjoyment of all five senses. Our group was looking for a unique upscale Chinese restaurant and the chef as well as the rest of the team exceeded those expectations. We began with a 7lb Australian lobster and shrimp sashimi. Note: This was not on the menu, but recommended by the chef. Needless to say this was a first, but we were not disappointed. The sashimi was followed with what was left of the lobster including deep fried head, leg and tail. Yumm!! Our main dishes consisted of wok-seared tenderloin beef, which was insanely tender and flavorful and abalone and chicken served in a clay pot. As we were there celebrating a birthday, they surprised us with traditional Chinese longevity peaches, basically a lotus flavored bun filled with a sweet surprise. This place was on the expensive side of things, but that is to be expected and very well worth it. This was an experience I will never forget and definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant for the price. It's small but the service is very friendly, and the prices are good, and most of all the food tastes great. It is authentic Hakka cuisine. Definitely worth a visit. There's a range of foods with various Asian influences."}
{"text":"Very elegant restaurant, very beautiful inside.  Utensils were goldware! It is very expensive.  Almost prohibitively so.  There are entrees on the menu that are over $300. Most are not, however.  There is a nice locals discount with their players club that brings the prices down to just expensive.  If you can get past all of that, it is a very fine restaurant and the staff and atmosphere make you feel first class.  The tenderloin beef cubes (which was reasonably priced) was delicious.  The sauteed lobster (which was on the crazy price menu) was not as good and kind of hard to eat.  The fried rice, which comes with the entree was probably the best I've tasted in Las Vegas.  I think this restaurant needs to tweak its menu just a little bit and it has the potential to do to the Asian dining experience what Michael's restaurant at the South Point casino did to the French dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since before my family even had smartphones, probably back as far as 2007. The staff are and have always been amazing to us, so much so that sometimes, when I just want my usual, I'll show up, and they'll bring it out.   The staff are friendly, helpful, and attentive. The food is of great quality and amazing portion size. I'm always stuffed whenever I eat here, and they are sensitive to my food allergy to peanuts!   I always come here for comfort foods, since the wide variety let's me pick if I want more veggies or more meat in the meal I'm ordering. I try to go whenever I come back from out of town, but sometimes that can be months apart. The food still tasted great today and I still will be a regular here for years to come, even if I move away!   What more can I say besides the fact that they have amazingly priced lunch specials between 11am and 3pm? You need to come here if you're a fan of Chinese / Indian \"Hakka\" cuisine. Worth becoming a regular for, especially if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, simple and quite, affordable price, tasty food, friendly staff.Overall it's a good restaurant.  Food is served right away. Good customer service!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is one of the best high end Chinese restaurants in town. I really like their new menu. Some of my favorite dishes include the shrimp cocktail, Sautéed Lobster, Mushrooms and Jalapeño Tenderloin Beef Cubes and the Mochi Ice Cream Duo. The ambiance is very nice and has a great view of the north strip. This is the perfect place to dine for a nice occasion."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night. We were the only table. Seated at 7:15, put the order in at 7:22. The food did not come out for a good 20 minutes. Both my husband and I ordered the lamb chops. His lamb chops came out and my order did not. Then the waiter said oh I only put one order in, what?!?! So I waited another30 minutes for the other order to come out. They told me at that point that they were out of asparagus. They then give me side of mushrooms. My mashed potatoes were ice cold. Seriously ?!?! At this point there were 5 tables. It is now 8:35 and I'm still waiting for the manager to come back around as he asked how everything was in the very beginning, then dashed off while we were telling him about our experience. Besides the gold forks and spoons. Expect to wait hours here to be served. This other table waited 40 minutes just to get the duck lettuce wraps. All I can say is... if you want a night out a Loooong night out with some $50 shake and bake lamb. This is the place to be!  *** just to be fair. It was not the servers fault. He was relying on the kitchen and the kitchen just wasn't cooking up his dishes, until the restaurant next door, restaurant pearl was done all their orders.  The management is to blame, when your manager sees that you are swamped and two managers walk back and forth past the guests and not assist the waiter in anyway is just terrible.   Instead they were trying to figure out what tunes to play as we have been dining in silence for almost 2 hours.   Management you guys need to be full on management, managers that are hands on can jump in and assist in every way to ensure a great guest experience.  Instead of wearing your suits and dresses, roll your sleeves up and get dirty.   After all it is the guest experience and food that counts.  For a high end Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Chinese/Southeast Asian food in southern Scarborough. Don't be fooled by its name. It is not related to the chain Phoenix Restaurants in Markham or western Scarborough. I'll give it 4 stars because the cost is affordable but I had better Southeast Asian food elsewhere"}
{"text":"Fantastic fine dining Chinese food that I've eaten at several times.  Menu was recently updated to add some less expensive items to make the restaurant a bit more approachable but without neglecting any of the classic delicacies that make this such a special destination."}
{"text":"This particular truck makes what they call naanwiches.  In other words they use naan bread to make the sandwich.  I tried the pulled pork one and it was great.  The pork was very tender and moist and the sauce they used to season it had a nice little bit of spicy kick to it.  They were also very fast at preparing my order."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice green curry with chicken and veggies"}
{"text":"This was a convenient location to get mediocre Hakka food. Got food from here about 5 times. I always ordered the same food, and one time the food was different. Weird sauce, weird taste etc. Called and asked about it, and the guy was so rude and and spoke over me the whole time. Didn't offer any help or anything. And hung up the phone on me. Haven't been back since and don't plan on it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We ordered the Hakka chow mein, crispy beef and green curry. Everything and I mean everything was delicious! If you are ever in the Kingston rd and eglinton area, make sure you go here. The staff is so friendly and attentive.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely a good Hakka spot in the neighbourhood. They give great portions and delicious food. We have tried a variety of their meats, rice and noodles and it's always been a joy! I would definitely recommend this joint to friends."}
{"text":"Our first visit. Ordered take out.  A pleasant surprise as to quality, texture, subtlety of flavours.  Palate pleasing.  Even the fried rice wasn't the least bit greasy.  Highly recommend the bacon wrapped shrimp with mango salad.  The sweet/tart of the mango offset the richness of the shellfish and bacon beautifully.  Also tried a green curry seafood dish, and the pad thai.  We all enjoyed our dinner tonight!"}
