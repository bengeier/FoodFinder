{"text":"This funny little place used to be the popular Vermont Sandwich Company ... and with the newly added coffees and teas it really should be twice as popular. It's kind of hard to find, tucked away in the Fry's center at 90th and Via Linda in north Scottsdale, but it's truly worth the visit.  Julie (the owner, from Boston) is a fountain of interesting lore and anecdotes, and serves a unique cup of delicious coffee -- private and secret blend, she says -- along with healthy, tasty sandwiches, all fresh made. Some are legacy recipes from the old \"Vermont\" store, some are new and different, and you can build your own.  Breakfast sandwiches, too.   I lucked into it today for the first time. I WILL be going back. You should too."}
{"text":"This place has a warm, friendly vibe and yummy drinks!  The woman who helped me was super helpful and made me feel comfortable even though it took me a while to order. I had a vegan & sugar free chai latte which was delish! I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The lady working was so kind and helpful, our desserts were delicious but our sandwiches (the wicked something, can't remember exact name) were PERFECT! It's been a couple days and I just want that sandwich again!"}
{"text":"East & West is a true treasure. Friendly, EXCELLENT and bountiful sandwiches and salads made to order.  Julie is the owner and such a joy and an outstanding cook.  Wanted one of her pastries but resisted this time."}
{"text":"Welcome to our new neighbors in The Fry's Marketplace Plaza.  Very best wishes for much success!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. GREAT coffee.  At the top of my list.  Julie, the owner, does everything based on quality and creativity. One of the BEST chicken salad sandwiches I've ever eaten. She even has sugar syrups for the coffee drinks because we all know it work better than granules."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that Vermont Sandwich Company was closed, but very glad we came in anyway. The ladies are super friendly and the food was excellent. Portuguese bean soup had lots of vegetables and chunks of ham. Cobb salad had the usual goodies but real roasted turkey breast. The cupcakes looked beautiful so we couldn't resist the chocolate macadamia nut (their cakes are Hawaiian inspired).  And they have wifi!"}
{"text":"I did some exploring today using one of my favorite websites (http://wtfsigte.com warning: site uses vulgar language) and I noticed this place pop up. I wasn't disappointed!  Walking in the place was pretty quiet, two workers greeted me happily and I placed an order for The Hatch (full) with pasta salad, and an iced mocha. I decided I wanted to dine in. Service was amicable and it was felt in the food as well!   Sandwich was nicely toasted, meat was piled nice and tall, and the veggies tasted fresh. The pasta salad was really good and complimented the sandwich nicely; it as seasoned and dressed perfectly.  Iced mocha was really flavorful, and I noticed they use a local source for their coffee \"Espressions\".  Overall, I'd be happy to come back again!"}
