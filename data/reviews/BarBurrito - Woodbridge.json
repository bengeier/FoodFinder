{"text":"Thought I'd try something new. Something on the healthy & fresher side.  Wanted to order the fish tacos.  Was made aware it would be about 15 minutes for fish.  Couldn't wait. Ordered the steak tacos.  Looked decent.  Didn't take too long to get.  Decent selection & staff seemed decent.  .. Results.  Steak had next to no taste. Not sure how they make the steak PCs ?  No spice.  No flavour. .. Disappointed. Likely any other meat would of hopefully had some flavour.  Mexican = flavour.   I might go back.  Not for steak. Fish ? Maybe. 
Wasn't made aware of any sauces or spices.  They just make & hand them too you ! Very blah for tacos or Mexican !!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat there quite often about twice a week. Yes they sometimes take their time but that is because they put effort in their burritos. The quality is amazing and I really like that they make everything from scratch. Best burritos are chicken and pulled pork in my opinion. Everyone there is also very friendly. I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Bad macros, their chicken has like no protein. I can't believe I gave them a good rating on google reviews."}
