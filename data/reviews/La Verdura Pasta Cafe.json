{"text":"I have been a fan of this restaurant since the opening! The quality of the ingredients is excellent, the presentation divine and the taste is exquisite! All this at reasonable prices! Do not miss the famous Verdura salad. So delicious that the vinaigrette is even sold in grocery stores!"}

{"text":"La vera cucina Italiana!  As simple as this / Aussi simple que cela  Et tout client est trait√© avec classe!  Oh and ask for their signature salad dressing to bring back home! Miam!!!  NOTE: Apportez votre vin / Bring your wine"}
{"text":"This place we happened to stumble into on our way to Mont Tremblant.  The food was FANTASTIC, the fact that they have gluten free options was just what my family needed.  When we were done with our meal we had 4 empty palates.  That said it all.  I would absolutely go back If ever in the area."}
{"text":"Extremely attentive and caring service from everyone we met. The servers and owner are all absolutely lovely. The food is wonderful. There's a reason this place is so busy. The restaurant cares about not only its food but provides better customer service than restaurants that are far pricier. Super impressed!"}
