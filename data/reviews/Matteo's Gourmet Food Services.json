{"text":"I hired Matt and his staff to cater a party with 18 guests for a 60th anniversary party for my in-laws.  We decided on a menu of small plates and everything was just fantastic.  Some of our menu items included:  Mini short rib grilled cheese w/ sharp cheddar roasted wild mushroom and creamy horseradish sauce, served on the side    Teriyaki steak and chicken kebab   Filipino sweet sausage mini tacos w/ pickled cabbage and papaya & crispy garlic  Herb marinated roasted pork belly over polenta cake w/ pickled shallots and pork jus  caprese skewer or mini pesto veggie panini with marinated grilled portobello, roasted eggplant, peppers, onions  We hired a personal chef in lieu of getting a private room at an upscale restaurant.  The event was so much more satisfying because the food was tasty, fresh, and interesting, we had our own space and music to enjoy, and everyone could move about to socialize and to relax.  Matt worked with me to develop a menu, he worked within my budget, suggested a bakery for the cake and even picked it up for us.  He and his crew arrived on time, worked efficiently in an unfamiliar kitchen, and completely cleaned up after themselves.  Matt and his staff were friendly, service oriented, and kept the perfect balance of being available, but not intrusive to the party.  Every guest had a terrific time and loved, loved, loved the food and the personal service.  I live out of town, but Matt made it easy to plan the party, keeping up timely communication via email, phone, and text.  Thanks Matt for a party that everyone thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"We had hired Matteo's for a gathering of 6 people (3 couples). Rather than going to the strip to find parking and walk a mile to any restaurant, we decided to have a personal chef come to our home for a more intimate , comfortable and personal experience. This was our first time hiring a personal chef and certainly won't be the last. Matteo came well prepared, and his personal staff were professionally dressed and very attentive. We opted for an eight course meal and every dish that was presented was far beyond what we had expected. Everything from the unique medley of different ingredients to the artsy presentation of each dish, we could not have asked for anything more. Unlike major 5 star restaurants who pump out dish after dish, having a personal chef gives you an intimate experience and each dish is literally executed to your liking. I can't recommend Matteo's enough. His professionalism and creativity is something that I can truly respect and appreciate. We will definitely be using him for future gatherings and events."}
{"text":"Matt and his team catered my father in-law's 80th birthday celebration in February at our home in Henderson. Matt's professionalism was very impressive throughout the planning stages and especially the night of the party. As an anxious hostess- Matt was a calming influence every step of the way; he was responsive by phone or email.  The food was excellent, the service was impeccable. We had a full bar which proved to be a nice touch especially with the gracious bartender. I did most of the planning while working out of town in a different time zone.  We have hosted other catered events at our home but as my mother in-law said:  \"This was by far the best one, our neighbors are still talking about the food!\""}
{"text":"Matt and his staff catered our Vegas wedding in February.  The food and presentation was spectacular! My husband is a total food snob having eaten at some of the best places in the world,  and he was so pleased with Matt and his staff.  They were extremely professional and ensured that everything was served at exactly the appropriate time. I highly recommend Matteo's to anyone celebrating a grand occasion! Thank you, once again, Matt and Team!!!"}
{"text":"For our annual Friendsgiving this year we hired Matteo's Gourmet Food Services. We could not have made a better choice! 6 courses of wonderful food with perfect wine pairings, we and our guests were very impressed. When asked which was our favorite, we could not choose only one. Spectacular dinner - thank you Matt and we plan to have you back next year!"}
{"text":"Cheff Matt has now produced two outstanding holiday dinners at our annual family Christmas gathering and he's knocked it out of the park each time! I've been so impressed with not only his creative and delectable menus, but also the amazing service he and his staff provide each time. From prep to presentation to clean-up, Matt and his team are a delight to work with and we look forward to seeing him at more family events!"}
