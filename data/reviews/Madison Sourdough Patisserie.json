{"text":"The food is beautiful and tasty. I can attest to the London Fog and Lemon macarons and the raspberry eclair (which has a have nicely raspberry...y flavor and is not too sweet).  The kicker: I'm a klutz. I took three steps out of the store and dropped my box of pastries on the wet ground. I went back inside to throw them away. The employees replaced them without hesitation. I will go out of my way to return to this store and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"5 stars because it's the most ambitious pastry shop in madison and has some of the most adventurous flavors. with that said, not everything is consistently good. excluding their puff pastry desserts (eclaire, religiueuse, paris-brest are all tasty) and gelato, pretty much everything else has disappointed me. It's hard to justify paying the premium price for it. And once I bought a $16 ladyfingner cake and it must have been old because it honestly tasted like store-bought angel food cake.  This place has a couple seats inside but it's kind of sterile; I wouldn't want to hang out here."}
{"text":"Did I just have a $4 piece of \"from the freezer\" cake? My partner and I stopped later on a Sunday afternoon for lunch at Madison Sourdough next door and decided to give MSCo a try. The shoppe ambience and menu suggested that upon our first bite we'd need a few moments to savor the goodness but that was not what was to come. The simple vanilla buttercream cake was dry and flavorless and clearly recently frozen. Perhaps we chose the wrong day but I've no idea how this place has such positive reviews. There are other more deserving dessert shoppes in Madison!"}
{"text":"The perfect Cream Puff. Pastry delicate, melts in your mouth. Cream subtlety sweet, balanced texture. Obviously know what they are doing here."}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say?  I'm happy we have a small version of Extraordinary Desserts in our area.   It's more the experience than the desserts. We got the feature white cake with lemon flavor, the strawberry rhubarb sorbet and an oprah cake.   They also have a list of wine and beer available.   The flavours were there but muting really stood out. We really enjoyed the desserts outside.  Nice,  very accommodating service.   Check their Facebook for free screen movie nights in the summer!"}
{"text":"A weekly stop for treats, conveniently located on Willy street! I would definitely give 5 stars for the pastries, but maybe 3 for the venue. Although it is attached to MSD, somehow the indoor area of Patisserie is not to my liking. At times it is a little stuffy (insufficient air circulation), and it seems like there are very few tables.   Definitely a pricier place for sweet pastries, but it is just as expensive as getting dessert at a restaurant. So I would call the prices reasonable. I enjoyed every dessert I've tried there and I think I've been through most of them.. lol. Some recommendations:  Chocolate crunch tart - unassumingly delicious tart. love the crunchy bits and awesome crust! Financiers - I almost always leave with a financier. I love the hazelnut chocolate one, the pistachio one, they are so good for a light breakfast!! Peanut butter flavored cronut looking like pastry (will update with name after I check it out again) - so good! the cream wasn't too overwhelming, and love the nuts on it!!   I'm really grateful that there is a nice spot to hang out with friends for desserts and some light beer/wine while you wait for tables at neighboring restaurants on Willy street. And the desserts are wonderful for bringing home as well. As I mentioned, I frequent this place weekly, so you might see me there next time ;)   P.S. When is the gelato available? Please have them soon!!!"}
{"text":"Madison Sourdough Co.'s new child..MSCo Patisserie... began life yesterday.... and this kid is going places! Wow! The artistry and craftsmanship required to create some of their delicacies seems like it must take years to learn. I had the Plum Clafoutis and one of their Lemon Chocolate Macaroons and both were wonderfully delicious. A delicate balance of fruitiness and sweetness that is very hard to master. The rum and orange marinated plum came through solidly but did not over-shadow the custard. Just enough moisture but not too dry. My tastebuds were doing a happy dance! I'd have tried all they were offering but I'm watching my waistline....and my wallet! You will pay for quality but it is worth it! The menu may seem small (about 17 or so items) but many have several different flavors and you will not leave wishing they had something else. Besides, based on the freezer case a little farther down from the bakery creations, it looks like Gelato or some hand-made frozen delectable will soon expand the menu options. Adjoining it's parent's place, this kid's room might be considered a little austere, but they've done well decorating and it has an up-scale hominess (if it's not a word, it should be!) to it. Since they also sell wine & beer (including a large format...25 oz.... Ale Smith Speedway Stout for $22!) you'll soon feel like you're all curled up on your couch in your Snuggie anyway, if you indulge. I will definitely be back to sample more of their fare...sans the Snuggie of course."}
{"text":"So incredibly delish! I love the ambiance and the pastries... not to mention the ice cream! I stopped in to Madison Sourdough and noticed the open door. I'm so glad I went in, because it has made my life a better place.  So far, I've tried the Strawberry Pistachio Dacquoise and the Religieuse. Both light, fluffy, and airy -- the way I like my desserts. The raspberry plum sorbet is also incredibly good. You taste the raspberry up front, then taste the plum flavors on the back end.  My only qualm? They are still in the process of getting up and running, so they ran out of a lot of their ice cream and were in the process of making it when I stopped in for the second time this week."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! The people who work here couldn't be more nice and the pastries are incredible! If you want to try real European quality pastries from people who are baking with passion and doing things the old school way, then stop here and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The macarons keep me coming back! They are expensive (paid $13 for five of them today) but so worth it! The display is so pretty, it's hard to choose even if I'm getting my go-to. I had to restrain myself from getting the spiced pear tarte, at least for today. ;)"}
{"text":"OMG!!  If Madison Sourdough wasn't the best as it was, here comes perfection!  Macaroonies!  Now gelato!  Them pistachio puffs the bomb diggity!  Can't get enough taste!  Ugh!  Drool all over!  Believe It!  I'm Gonna Be King of the Pastry Eaters!"}
{"text":"Mmm fancy pastries. I was strongly encouraged to come here after a friend recommended it, and despite the relatively small selection of choices I thought I might go out of my way to give it a try. Eh, not impressed. I ordered an opera cake, a lavender macaron, and a cassis macaron. The cake was pretty good - balanced sweetness and a rich chocolate flavor. The macarons were less ideal - they were chewy, which could be because the ganache has soaked through the shells and softened them into a taffy-like consistency. I felt \"A-OK\" with this place, thus three stars."}
{"text":"Lovely place for coffee and dessert.  We stopped in after dinner on Willy Street.  I can't comment on the bakery because we're currently limiting sugar in our diet but the espresso breve that we each got and the staff themselves were wonderful.  They made us feel welcome and advised on all the coffee and espresso selections that were available.  Many times coffee shops add a side of attitude that you didn't order with your coffee/goodies, happy to report that wasn't the case here."}
{"text":"Yes, Willy St. is a far cry from Bordeaux but you must grab a canele if they have them.  Soft and tender on the inside with a nice carmelized crust, they are a perfect one (if you are a pig like me) or two bite treat.  Beside caneles, the patisserie features other sweet delicacies.  My other faves being the Sable Breton as well as the Opera Cake/  But let's be honest, the only thing holding me back from liking all of them is my waistband and blood sugar level."}
{"text":"So so so good! Came here late on a Saturday evening. It's an unassuming little place from the outside that's very clean looking (if not sparse). There is a very small display of desserts (which all look excellent) and a limited ice cream option. However, after examining everything we decided to settle on the expresso cake.   This may have been one of the best (if not the best) desserts I have ever had (and I'm a huge fan of ice cream based desserts so it's very difficult to change my mind). The expresso cake was very very indulgent, with rich creamy chocolate and thick mousse mixed with layers of chocolate cake. The star of the slice was the fantastic layer of gooey salted caramel. Everything was heavenly and wonderful and there was a bonus perfectly chewy and delightful half macaron on top which was icing on the cake (maybe not the best metaphor).   It's a bit pricey if you want to cater for a large group or if you want a box of macarons but for a rich dessert craving, check it out!"}
{"text":"Their chocolate cake is to die for! It is so delicious and I have been back here multiple times to get the cake. You need to come here if you are in the area! The chocolate cake is my favorite thing here. The Macaroons are quite delicious as well (albeit slightly overpriced). Please come here!"}
{"text":"Beautiful pastries, beautiful space. I can't believe it's taken me until now to make my way in. The impetus for my trip was to buy a small thank you gift and after browsing their website I found a few small and affordable treats to make up a little gift box comprising caneles and shortbread cookies (chocolate and lavender). I also ended up treating myself to a hazelnut religieuse - give a little, get a little?   The two women who helped me were welcoming, efficient, patient with my indecision, and happy to answer any questions I had. When I butchered the pronunciation of religieuse, I was corrected without condescension. They were also unbothered by my needing to box up and ring out in two separate orders with two separate cards, and made sure I had the receipts I needed.   Now, onto the part we actually care about: how delicious was that hazelnut religieuse? Incredibly. These pastries are meant to be savored, enjoyed, looked at. The choux dough was light and the larger puff had a slightly sweet and crackly coating. The hazelnut cream was smooth and flavorful, and the small accents of chocolate frosting were delicious. The highlight for me, though, was an addition that was but an accent - a dab of smoky caramelized sugar on top. It's not meant to be the star, but combined with the main elements of the dessert it was out of this world. In the future I will save the tiny topper for last.   Some of the desserts can be a bit pricy, but if you keep in mind that these treats are meant to be savored and focused on as opposed to just a means for satisfying your sweet tooth, the price tag won't seem so steep."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and pastry. Definitely the best pastry you'll find in Madison. Their cream puffs are marvelous. I tried couple of their cakes and they exceeded my expectations. I also once tried the diablo breakfast plate and liked it. Overall, my favorite breakfast place in Madison"}
{"text":"I found MSCO Patisserie lovely but a little impractical.   There's a small display with a few pastries, tarts and cookies. All are beautiful and look delicious, but not things I'd typically buy at a bakery. I may eat little fancy one-serving desserts at a restaurant, but I don't know why I'd bring them home.   Soon, they will offer a little more when they start selling gelato. They gave me a free sample and it was pretty good! Complex flavors and super rich. Was nice to sit outside in the sun and enjoy.  The macarons are SOOO DELICIOUS! Almost made me not hate myself for paying $2.50 for a medium sized cookie. Almost.  I realize it's a high end shop, but I just don't think I could justify paying these prices unless I was giving a gift or something."}
{"text":"What a welcome reprieve from an exhausting morning was this little slice of Parisian paradise. Pierre creates the most exquisite pastries I've seen yet in Madison. This is reflected in the price point, so be prepared for that. I was drooling over the citrus tart, but couldn't quite cough up $7 for a tiny treat. I opted for the blood orange cake, a more affordable $4.50 per slice, and it was simply superb. Flawless in flavor and design and execution. What a treat! I took it over to enjoy at the counter seating area at Madison Sourdough, as they are a combined business. I preferred to order a drip coffee over a French Press, which is all that they serve in the patisserie. I see me coming back here again and again for a tiny oasis of pure delight on those days when I need a real treat. LOVE."}
{"text":"Beautiful fancy bakery items and very nice coffee and tea offerings, all for a pretty penny.  My fiance and I came here a few days after MSCo opened. We split the citrus tart ($7 for a teeny tart), and it was outstanding. Probably one of the best citrus desserts I've ever had, but quite expensive.   The space is lovely, and all of the bakery items looked drool-worthy. However, I would probably treat this as a special occasion bakery. They have very pretty boxes of macarons and other attractive baked goods that would make nice gifts, so I'll likely come for those or for dessert on a special day."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here for a little treat. Usually ending up leaving with a box of colorful macaroons. Great service and priced well."}
{"text":"The MSCo Patisserie was a stop on the Caffeine Crawl this past weekend.  I have heard of their delicacies and seen their Market table but have never been to the shop.  I now know what I was missing.  The good thing about the Crawl was we got to sample their opera cake, nitro stout ice cream float, and their caramel coffee pudding.  I will be back to try more, now that I know where they are on Willy St.  Thank you for being a part of the Caffeine Crawl!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to MSCo patisserie and it did not disappoint. Everything looked delicious in the case. I had been wanting to try their french macarons for a while. They had 5 flavors, that change weekly. The vanilla cacao nib flavor was amazing. They are pricey, $2.75/each but that's about average price. I also had the chocolate rye orange cream puff. The cream puff was also amazing. The orange cream in the middle was light and not overwhelmingly orangey. The chocolate puff was light and there was a light chocolate sauce or spread on the inside. I will definitely be back for more macarons and their other pastries, which also change. Staff was also helpful and friendly explaining what the different desserts were."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing!  I picked up three of their 4 inch tarts for a dinner part we were hosting and they made me look good :)  We had the citrus tart, the chocolate hazelnut crunch and a raspberry tart.  They were all divine...perfect crust, decadent fillings and were beautiful to boot.  I love pretty food!"}
