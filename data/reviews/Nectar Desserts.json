{"text":"Wow!  This little hidden gem in Inglewood has been my favourite find of the year! My mom and I wondered in looking to have lunch...Well, they don't really do that, but in the end we did not care!  The desserts were incredible to look at, the staff was very knowledgeable about what was in each dessert and even the history of some of them! Passion over dessert?? Yes, and it was fabulous!!  We ordered 3 between us and each one was spectacular!  The atmosphere was wonderful...Different tables and chairs, great chandeliers... And yes, if you have ever been to Serendipity in NYs Upper West Side, it has a similar feel...  Great job Nectar! I look forward to many more encounters :)"}

{"text":"Can't believe Calgary has a hidden gem of a dessert place!!   It's located above a narrow flight of white stairs that make you believe you have transcended to heaven as you reach the top to find all these delectably sweet delights beautifully made and showcased behind a glass case ready for your choosing.    It reminds me of a cross between a classy bakery/restaurant in downtown Los Angeles called Botegga Louie for it's fine pastries and the famous Serendipity in New York  City for it's atmosphere and eclectic mosh posh style of decor.    I was taken here by some family members after a late dinner at a restaurant nearby.   I was surprised to find a dessert place that's open late and packed.  After waiting awhile for a table we decided to take it to go.  People were enjoying their desserts and conversations and it didn't look like anyone was going to leave any time soon.  Can't blame them either, it seemed like such a cozy place where you can just relax, enjoy your sweets and/or your sweetheart.   We got a plain lemon tart, blueberry lemon tart, a slice of red velvet cake, 3 strawberry macaroons, 2 blueberry macaroons and I believe  an apricot and honey macaroon. It came to be about $40 which is a bit on the pricey side, but it's just that kind of a place.  The lemon tart was really too tart for me, but I tend not to like lemon desserts.  My family members liked the plain lemon tart better but thought the blueberry lemon tart had a nice twist in flavor.   The macaroons were airy but sweeter than I normally like them.  My family member thought they were good and liked the blueberry one the best.    My favorite was the red velvet cake.  I am a big fan of red velvet and have tried many different kinds.  This by far is THE BEST RED VELVET CAKE I have ever had!!!  It's not too sweet and the icing is blissful.  It just melts in your mouth as it tickles your taste buds.   I normally do not like the icing on cakes and leave it behind.  The icing on this cake is made with real vanilla beans because I can taste and see the vanilla specs on it.  I savored every bite of it.  Despite that this place is a bit overpriced and getting  a table was difficult, I will still have to give it 5 stars for the out of body experience with the red velvet cake and friendly service.  I will definitely have to come back before heading home to the states next week."}

{"text":"Ah Nectar...if you've never had a food-gasm, please go here.   Walking in is kind of like an adventure with Alice into Wonderland; the stairs are almost too narrow, the furniture and lighting and art seem larger than life. The flavors are most certainly larger than life. All made fresh and on-site by a dessert chef (is that what it's called?), everything, just EVERYTHING is to die for. I've had the gelato, which may not be on the menu anymore, the Cream on Cream and shared the Pavlova and they have all been amazing.   The service is really friendly (and understanding, haha :D) and the menus suggest wine pairings with each dessert. Care and passion are obviously poured into each creation. It's a pricey food experience but WELL worth it.   How worth it? I made the mistake of going once with a guy friend when our flirtationship (look it up in Urban Dictionary) was not so well-defined and almost went home with him. That's how ridiculous the dessert is at Nectar. You should go, with friends, with \"sort-of\" friends, with best friends, but most importantly with tastebuds prepared for awesomeness."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to hear that this gem of a place has closed! We drove by to grab a post dinner coffee/dessert... and gone it was! :( Hope the owner will let us know if she has more desserts in store for us!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here whil visiting in Calgary. It was a bit pricey, but definately worth it.  The pastries are excellent, and I love that it's hidden, quiet and has character.   We came here on full stomaches still from lunch, so it was just the right about of dessert."}
{"text":"Nectar Desserts is located upstairs in an older, funky building. If you're lucky you can get a table overlooking 9th Avenue.  All of the furniture is eclectic and mismatched yet works so well.  This a perfect place for a romantic date, or just hanging with your girlfriend. I went with my girlfriend after we enjoyed some Chinese food on 9th Avenue, fortune cookies just weren't enough for us!  The dessert case at Nectar is filled with tarts and cakes that will drive your tastebuds wild! I had a quince with roasted apple tart (yum!), and my girlfriend had a wild cranberry butter tart. Two espressos went along perfectly with our selections.   You can also choose to pair your dessert with a wine...could life get any more perfect???"}
{"text":"I went to Nectar last year and had some of the best desserts ever. The wait was long, but my friends and I were rewarded with a free glass of great wine and some amazing dessrts. I was totally sad to hear that Nectar closed, as I really wanted to go back the next time I was in Calgary. So many desserts, so little time."}
{"text":"Nectar Desserts is made up of clouds and dreams and sweet things. Even the entrance is a touch magical. You climb the stairs and come face to face with glass case that holds all of their take-out desserts, themselves spectacular and delicious. Then you turn around to huge windows looking out over Inglewood, and a very cute layout filled with mis-matched armchairs. It just looks... inviting.  So you sit down, and they present you with the menu. The most difficult thing is deciding what of the many delicious options you will pick! They all sound so good, so it is a real nail-biting moment. They are a little pricey but most definitely worth every penny. The servers have very helpful suggestions of great drink accompaniments. They have some standout wines, and also some really delicious gourmet teas!  Of course, the best part is always the dessert! This is what makes Nectar so completely, unbelievably wonderful. Homemade s'mores with hand made graham crackers, fresh marshmallows and caramel sauce. To die for. The Pavlova is to die for. And they change the desserts up. Sometimes that is unfortunate - some of my favourites have died. But that is only to make room for new ones. And each of those will help you understand theat good'ol french \"le petit mort\".  Honestly, I can't imagine bringing a boy here. It would be mildly sacreligious (be true to the desserts!) - but then my only holdouts on the date fronts are messy foods, shell fish and dessert. For me, nectar is pure girl's night territory. And ooh, what magical territory it occupies.  Somebody earlier mentioned a foodgasm. I can't agree more. And then obviously a little sumthin sumthin happens because I always leave with a food baby after!  A note on the take home desserts: I find these vary a bit more in taste than the eat-in menu. The fruit tarts are sooo light and airy and delicious. But once I had a smoky chocolate and salty caramel tart and it was mostly salty and smoky... The only time I've not been a fan of something nectar related."}
{"text":"Nectar is the most appropriate name for this dessert boutique as it feels that the desserts have been bestowed upon us by the GODS of heaven.  I noticed this place after eating at Sugo a couple of months ago and I swore I would come back.  The windows that wrap across the second floor of this character walk up screamed charm, magic and sweetness.  We were not disappointed, it's so true as soon as you open the door and proceed up the staircase you feel your heart pumping and the blood coursing through your veins, much like Alice chasing after the rabbit.    A huge smile from the barista above was immediately seen sparkling from the recesses below and when you reached the top you are whisked away to your table in what appears to be a very chic rendition of your favourite grandmother's home.  Complete with antique decorations, crystal dripping chandeliers and elaborate hats from the 20s hanging in your own person boudoir.  I ordered the sticky toffee pudding which is soaked in white caramel and topped with pistachio ice cream and my babe had the baby orange flower meringues with a palate of blackberries, passion fruit curd and Chantilly cream.  I swear we were in silence for the first 5 spoonfuls of our desserts and all we could do is look starry eyed until it ended.  There are 5 major desserts that are 12 dollars and slices of cake and tarts for 8 dollars.  There is homemade sherbet and homemade ice cream and even wine, beer and cocktails.  The whole dessert experience was fantastic, pricier that normal but well worth experiencing at least once."}
{"text":"Honestly.... meh... Sorry but 2 stars.  Visiting Calgary for a wedding and for the past week, have heard nothing but good things and recommendations for me to try this place. Finally was able to go and didn't think it was anything extra good, and definitely overpriced for the quality.  Friend had coconut passionfruit cake, I had the Mango Passionfruit tart. Coconut cake was DRY, dense, and heavy, and the icing was not very good. Tart was ok.  I would go back again ONLY to give them a 2nd chance... & I would try their sea salt chocolate tart as the \"waiter\" stated that it was one of the top 2 ordered desserts at Nectar (other one being their red velvet cake)."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place looking for an afternoon dessert.  A red door leads you up the stairs to this adorable cafe.  They have a case of delectable desserts making you want one of each.  We tried the chocolate tart and the red velvet with 2 cups of the delicious chai tea.  The chocolate tart is very decadent and as much i love chocolate i could only handle a couple bites.  But my boyfriend loved and recommended it.  The red velvet had an interesting twist with a vanilla frosting instead of cream cheese.  I liked the frosting but the cake was a little dry, could have been moister.  Asked the waitress and she said it was just made that morning.  The ambience of the place was great and if im ever in calgary again i will return!"}
{"text":"It's about time that Calgary gets a dessert place that's open even during Saturday evenings.  Great place for dessert after a nice dinner elsewhere.  Since Nectar is only a dessert place... know that the prices of the dessert plates are like that of an entree, around the 12 dollar mark.  But they're worth it.  They have an excellent collection of drinks too.  It's really a good place.  It felt like I left Calgary when I went in Nectar.  Yay to calories, in style!"}
