{"text":"Best cheese crisp in town.  Need tacos soft or hard shell will rock will rock your world"}
{"text":"First to start off few months ago hoped they improved on their service with not taking forever to get our order and also I found a hair in my food, so haven't been back again since November and now come to find out the tortillas had mold on them. Not good business."}
{"text":"This is why I love Arizona! Just going to the bank and noticed this restaurant. Never heard of it, really never noticed it ever being there. Was in the mood for some plain asada tacos with everything on it! They were great! Loved the marinated meat, with guacamole, cilantro. Nana is a little hole in the wall, one of the places you want to support. Living is Surprise we don't have anything like this. Everything is big chain restaurants.  This is a nice place, very clean, and very nice people working there. One thing I noticed, is Arizona is loaded with great Mexican food establishments. You just need to find them."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small Mexican restaurant (9 tables) hidden in an industrial park. Has the typical feel of the modest no frills authentic Mexican restaurant. We'll maintain and clean. Patrons all ages.  Food: All the standard Mexican staples are here. Their breakfast menu includes Chilaquiles which is nice to see. The lunch menu offers both Sonoran and Chihuahuan hot dogs. Many people rav about their enchiladas but I went with the lunch special Milanese pollo (breaded and fried chicken) it was exceptionally good. The flour tortillas were also amazing.  Service: Very friendly, was able to answer all my questions. Food came out fast and piping hot.  Overall: A great hidden gem for Mexican when you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place.  It's a bit of a dive but such delicious and authentic food.  I had the huevos rancheros and the sauce was light, spicy and tangy.  The beans were homemade and delectable.  The two ladies who run this place are a delight and really want their customers to be satisfied and happy.  Great place."}
{"text":"The chilaquiles are the best here!!! I get them for lunch everyday. Good portions and very authentic"}

{"text":"Small Mexican food restaurant with a large selection to choose from! We have becoming here for years for lunch. The food is great and comes out fast!! Try their hard shell chicken tacos with fresh Mexican cheese! So Good!!!"}
{"text":"This place really disappointed me.This is first and last time eating here. I ordered 2 Sonoran hot dogs without onions,they brought me both hotdogs with onions and very saggy you couldn't even eat them.Oh by the way the bacon was not wrapped around the sausage. If you ever had Sonoran hotdogs you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Hit or miss long wait so if your in. A hurry not the spot to come and go had the mole enchiladas and the Monday special the Monday special was good but the enchiladas were very so so  and they forgot my eggs that I wanted but waited way to long for me to even care about having them at that point and the services was very so so as well probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place about 100 times and finally decided to stop for lunch. The food and service were excellent and the whole restaurant is extremely clean."}
{"text":"Great fast and friendly and also delicious! I would recommend this place. I ordered a chorizo bean,egg, and potato burrito with cheese it was amazing so i highly recommend this place. It is my second time visiting this place."}
{"text":"Lunch was not as quick as it could have been , but all in all service was friendly and informative. The food on the other hand was great , I think they make there own tortillas, and we can make u any thing u'd like attitude  . A little pricey"}
