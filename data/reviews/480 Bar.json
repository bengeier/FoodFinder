{"text":"Great service . We came in on Taco Tuesday 1.00 .. Great taco for the price. You have the choice of hard shells or soft. Beers & Wells are very reasonable.  The bartenders make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"I always have a good time here.  Karaoke Steve is the nicest and the bartenders are great.  Stay away. Its too drunk collar for most of you and you'll be taking up table space.."}
{"text":"Neighborhood dive bar. Stopped in with some out of town family who wanted to do karaoke. The atmosphere is typical dive bar with regulars, but everyone is super nice and welcoming. Basic greasy bar food to soak up the booze."}
{"text":"I will visit here again should I be in the area.  This is THE CLEANEST bar I have ever been in.  Did not give 5 stars just because we did not try the food but the beer was ICE cold!!"}
{"text":"Had a couple beers at this out of the way dive bar.  Rough crowd."}
{"text":"Talk about a 5-star dive bar! Definitely one of my newest favorite places!! Cheap drinks, friendly patrons & staff, touch-tunes jukebox, darts & pool tables.... what more could you ask for?!?!"}
{"text":"An interesting dive bar in the heart of downtown chandler! Great selection of local beers on tap and extremely clean. Staff was extremely friendly and prompt on our orders. 480 has 4 pool tables to play on!   Pro tip: Avoid the food. It appears everything is from the freezer and deep fried here! I didn't eat the food but what i saw it didn't look to appealing."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover...  I have lived in the Chandler/Gilbert area for many years and I would have never thought to go in this place. It is in a rougher part of Chandler and seems a little sketchy from the front. We ere feeling adventurous and decided to give it a try.  Once inside it was very pleasantly surprised. It was so clean! Don't get me wrong it is defiantly a dive bar, but a very well kept one. It didn't even smell like a bar. They have pool tables and lots of seating. The bartenders were very friendly. This is a great place to go if you are looking to hide out and have some drinks and shoot some pool. They have karoke on Friday and Saturday nights. They serve standard fried bar  food, but they allow you to bring in food from Chilly Billy's next door.  Give it a try. No need for dressing up..."}
{"text":"After driving by this bar(location) for 20+ years, my hubby and I finally came in here for Friday night Karaoke.   We were very surprised with how friendly and safe it felt when we first walked in (not what you'd expect for the area). We were greeted by the bartender, CJ, who is an absolute doll! She was very attentive and super sweet! We were also helped by Wes who was just as nice! 1l  The crowd was a great mix of everyone! The songs ranged from pop to rap to rock to metal to show tunes! We had the best time! Plus, this location has an App for karaoke where you can look at the songbook and put your song in without leaving your table.   Kitchen is open till 11PM (on Fridays) and is your typical bar food - but for super cheap!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went last night at 7pm. me (grandma), daughter, son -in-law, teenager and pre-teen. What a friendly bar! The staff, owners, patrons. It reminded me of small  town bars in Wisconsin. We are from there and heard about the $5 fish fry on Friday nights! Awesome especially the cloe slaw ! Wonderful wings, poppers and chicken tenders too! Can't wait to bring friends there. A safe family friendly place. Never intended to stay for karaoke but glad we did stay for about 6 singers. Fun night!!!"}
{"text":"A couple of coworkers dragged us here for drinks one Friday night. There was some lady there hosting karaoke. Also lots of pool tables. Touchtunes in the corner by the window. Had a few pints of beer and mostly hung with our crowd although we met a few salty regulars. This crusty old dude comes up to me when I was talking to the two coworkers that dragged us here. He pointed to one of them and asked me if that was my girlfriend. NOPE. So he quickly pointed at the other and asked if SHE was my girlfriend. LOL. Strike two, pal. I tried to explain that they were actually each other's girlfriends. Other team and all that jazz. He responded with some convoluted tale that translated into a variation of \"some of my best friends are _____.\" LOL. Place has that neighborhood bar kind of feel but still divey. You can enter from the Arizona Avenue and there's some parking right on the street. There's also a back door that opens up to a parking lot if you take Oakland Street and go south at the first alleyway on the left. I'll probably get dragged here again sometime."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is so welcoming and warm! Everyone here is here for the same reason and that's to have fun! I came on a Saturday (karaoke) and everyone had a wide variety of songs to where you couldn't pick any wrong song to sing. From country to classic rock to new songs of today! The ladies bathroom is very clean and drinks are reasonably priced. The area is a little sketchy but once you're in, you forgot about the outside world. Thanks for giving me a great time for a good price!"}
{"text":"Great little place for cold beer after work! Go visit Sherry the bartender Wednesday thru Friday 11:00 - 6:00pm (and every other weekend days)! Not only is she hot but she's quick with your drinks and always friendly.  Bar food is a bit limited and is going to be deep fried, but they do good lunch specials everyday."}
{"text":"This place can be fun but it is very hit or miss. I've been there when it was a fun crowd, and I've gotten there and left because it had a bit of a \"you might get shanked\" ambience, if you know what I mean. Depends on the night I guess! Nice liquor and beer selection, good food. Smells a little bad in there."}
{"text":"Great karaoke! Will be back again! Love Mariam and what a voice! Tons of fun and feels right at home."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing divey gem!!! $3 strong drinks on Sundays. Great drink prices. Bartender is super cool and can whip up a kickass bloody Mary and other various drinks chill place. Darts and pool tables. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I love Max & Ted's! It's my favorite local dive bar! Great selection, and great atmosphere. The best kind of place to just relax with friends and feel totally at home!"}
{"text":"One word: Autofry, another word: karaoke, two more words: wood paneling. 480 is an awesome dive bar with great characters, cheap drinks and friendly staff. Perfect when you want to slap on some jeans and a tshirt and not worry if you look good, just drink and have a great time."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of 480 Bar! This place is not located in the best part of Chandler, and it may be a little awkward to find parking, but I love it. Looking at previous reviews, everyone stated how clean this place was, and for a dive bar - it is fantastically clean. The booze was cheap and the waiters/waitresses were decent people.The crowd here is also really fun, they have younger people, middle aged people, bikers, suburban parents, and me! I will ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY be back. P.S their karaoke night was off the chain!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. We walked in here and they were almost surprised that someone would walk into this crap hole. We stayed for about an hour and were treated absolutely horrible by the girl running karaoke. We paid our tab and couldn't get out fast enough. I love a good dive bar but not a completely rude one. This was a pitiful place to spend our money"}
{"text":"Don't bother. The TV situation sucks, my Coors Light didn't taste fresh, and the clientele wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. Much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Karaoke every Thursday Friday and Saturday from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Hosted by Starzkaraoke #KjMolly on Thursdays, #KjMiri-J Fridays and Saturdays.  Entertaining group songs and weekly contests coming soon. Great place to have a bite to eat and enjoy the daily drink specials and discounts during Karaoke nights! Love hosting here and I can't wait to hear you sing! Remember it's just like singing in your car, or shower but with better acoustics and a microphone!"}
{"text":"When I left this place the bartender threw her fist up in the air and told me to go take on the world. How cool is that?  I was impressed by how clean it was inside.  Plus they have craft beer on tap for $3.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my neighbors, and I'm glad I came to Max and Ted's. This place is a dive bar, but so much fun, and the people are great. There's a ton of regulars, including myself now, and of course new people pop in all the time. Great drinks, great atmosphere, and the lady that does the karaoke on Saturday nights is AWESOME!!! And the jell-o shots rock."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I own a similar type bar in Orange County, CA and I was very impressed with the cleanliness and staff and the patrons are cool too. I was in town for my sons graduation and stopped in for a Bloody Mary. Had so much fun, I came back the next night. Jen is a great bartender and we had a really nice time. I'll stop in every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is a great hidden gem the bartender Cimdy makes the best drinks in town. Thank you for making the best sex on the beaches in  Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is ghetto. By that I only mean mean a disaster. You are pretty much guaranteed to get into trouble here.  Also, all of the food is deep fried and literally comes directly from Costco (according to the servers)."}
{"text":"I love Jason. I want to beat him in darts. We're going to wager something deeper than dollars."}
{"text":"Fun place!  My husband is majorly anti karaoke and even he's having fun!  The gal running it is actually enjoyable and getting everyone involved!!' Love this place"}
{"text":"Great little bar. Bartenders are friendly. Not a loud crowded place. Feels like a little hometown place."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelper's for your comments because I had to check this place out.  I'm so glad we did.  We went this evening for Karaoke with some friends and we all had a great time.  First time in a long time that I've stayed until almost closing.    The bartenders were great, drink prices were average but the customers are what made the bar rock the most.  By the end of the night we knew some of the patrons names.  Found out we had missed their BBQ they had earlier in the evening.    Neighborhood bars rock!  They made some awesome margaritas and had the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, they ran out of chicken wings at 7:03 pm... Better options, ANYWHERE..."}
