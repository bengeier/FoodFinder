{"text":"My husband & I made reservations for two for an anniversary. When we got to the restaurant they told us the restaurant was sold out to a Xmas party and proceeded to walk us out to their pizza place. They put us at a table in the middle of the doorway. I could not get into my seat it was so tight. I tried to pull the table out . That put my husband way in the middle of the doorway. They did have an open table for 4 but would not make it available to us. We just left the place. Ruined our evening!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Spring Training dinner at Tomaso's very much. the food was excellent and the service was great also, Generous portions and I loved the Parmesan Salad shell it was awesome. We will be back on our next Spring Training trip."}
{"text":"The fried calamari was great but the service and the seafood linguini special and the wedding soup were a 3 stars. We were not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Food is wonderful,  and good portions.  We always pick this restaurant when we want a nice relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Gino, our waiter, was extremely helpful and knowledgable about the menu! We were glad to have him as our server. The food was outstanding and our cream puff dessert was a home run! We will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place forgot about our table. They ran out of food and picked up frozen broccoli and potatoes to cover it up. 2 hours later we weren't fooled. Merry Christmas!  Side note, overheard cooks talking about a cursed table where tables are frequently forgotten. You are an absolute fool if you ever dine here!!"}
{"text":"First time review: GREAT place! Our server was Italian, and the food was true Italian (reminded us of our trip to Italy last year). It is a bit pricey, but the food is definitely worth it!   Second time review: Decent service, although some of our orders took a while to come. Calamari appetizer was large and very good. The beet salad was delicious! Both of our meals were good, but they were a bit too creamy."}
{"text":"Excellent meal tonight at Tomaso's in Phoenix AZ.  Menu contains descriptions of one mouthwatering selection after another. Impeccable service combined with a homey setting. Readily understandable why the restaurant has been around since 1977. What a treat from start to finish. Did I mention the best vodka martini I've had in weeks?"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian.  I would strongly suggest Tomaso's to anyone looking for authentic Italian in Phoenix.  This place is in the Biltmore area in the same strip mall (strip mall in Phoenix? Shocking!) as Sportsman and Tarbell's which leads to my only complaint--parking.  There is a free valet (tip them you cheapskates) so that problem is partially mitigated.  This place is a real throw back. The waiters are all pro's and have thick Italian accents.  The garlic butter offered with bread is out of this world so even though it's green and strange looking, enjoy it.  I was craving simple spaghetti and meatballs--it's not on the menu but they'll do it for you if you ask nicely.  Coupled with a few Morettis (decent Italian beer) it was a great experience. One place I recommend with confidence and will return to at the earliest opportunity."}
{"text":"Their customer service is horrible at best Phone call to order flowers the manager knew nothing about the order process on the website, was told that someone would call me back, not! Sent several emails still no response as of yet, 5 days and counting Sad to have made reservations 3 months in advance for an anniversary and have such a bad experience for such a highly rated restaurant. Cancelled the reservation due to lack of service!"}
{"text":"The veal marsala lacked any marsala/port flavor.  The veal was presented on top of a gravy mixture that did not add any flavor to the veal.  The veal florentine was slightly better as it was presented with lemon based sauce that did add to veal flavor.  Stay away from the $12 tiramisu.  The 2\" x 2\" serving size is embarrassing small.  The flavor is excellent but the miniscule portion size simply means our family will stay away from Tomaso's until the portion sizes reflect better value."}
{"text":"The last time I was at Tomaso's was 19 years ago for high school prom.  I've been excited to go for the last year and I was super disappointed. I ordered the King Salmon and it was fishy and overdone. The waiter was snobby when I tried to order a Moscow mule and they didn't have ginger beer.  I also felt pressured to order appetizers and desert when I wasn't hungry enough to want those. Go to North if you're looking for great Italian good and great service."}
{"text":"One of the finest Italian restaurants in Phoenix.  The service is excellent, the atmosphere is classy, and the food is outstanding.  I brought my father here when he was in town, (he's a third generation Italian) and he was also impressed."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had dinner at tomas's this friday night.  My wife found Tomaso's Restaurant  in the internet, and since it was by our hotel, we decided to dine there. To our surprise, the  restaurant had a great atmosphere and really authentic  Italian dishes. Even though we arrived quiet late at the restaurant, the staff made us feel very welcome. The waitress provided us with incredible attention and service, with a super friendly approach. She basically helped us decide what would best please our craving for italian cuisine. We are both looking forward to our next visit to arizona and of course to Tomaso's since its italian dishes as well as  service are exceptional."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the Gnocchi. Service was excellent. Romantic and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! Food is truly spectacular. Great ambiance, people, setting and service. Veramente ottimo!"}
{"text":"Really amazing Italian food. This is one of my must-go-to spots every time I'm in Phoenix. Ambiance, service & location are great. Valet parking out front is convenient.  They always hit the pastas & meat dishes way out of the park!"}
{"text":"We started the evening of March 2nd at Franco's.  Our waiter wasn't very friendly to begin with, but then the restaurant lost electricity.  After being told that the kitchen could still function, but never being told that it would actually take orders, we left after 20 minutes of being ignored and headed to Tomaso's.  That was the best decision of the evening.  The service at Tomaso's was excellent.  The wine and food were absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Arizona from Chino Hills California. We were directed to Tomaso's authentic Italian restaurant. Wow, excellent cuisine. I had the pistachio covered salmon and husband had the filet mignon ravioli. Masoud our waiter represents the epitome of a fine connoisseur. Excellent all around experience."}
{"text":"Standard fare.  I didn't see the costs, so I can't speak to that.  Service was excellent.  Pasta was slightly undercooked, bolognaise was a little bland.  Salad was inedible.  I would come back, but I wouldn't get too excited about it.  If and when I come back, I'll update my take on other dishes."}
{"text":"today's 'special' octopus salad was so bad my chickens won't eat it. i'm going to bed with an upset stomach.   it was served cold with a side of \"we don't care about your feedback or how crap our food is\"  forget this place. the bartender says tomasso is an asshole to work for anyway. as a final point, they've just undergone '5 days of renovations' but didn't wait for the paint fumes to clear. that's probably why the wine tasted so bad.    this place lacks the class it probably used to have"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Tomaso's for many years and have yet to have a bad experience! As a matter of fact, my wife and I have have brought many friendsand family with us to enjoy our favorite Italian restaurant and we have yet to find anyone who found the food or the service to be anything less than spectacular!    If you are looking for exquisite, authentic Italian food with the utmost in service, Tomaso's is the place.   Chuck & Lee"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to visit this place for years. I'm not sure why I put it off but eventually I tried it for a business dinner. The service was excellent, food incredible and the wine/cocktails were very complementary. I will be back and I'll be bringing more clients. Stellar experience."}
{"text":"I must give a shout out to this lovely restaurant. I was in Phoenix visiting a friend in the hospital and eating on my own. The hotel food was dismal, didn't want fast food, and everything else was Mexican, burger, or chain.I was craving pasta. Drove a little away from the busy section and saw Tomaso's. I thought it was a mid-range pizza place but was tired of driving around an unfamiliar city in the dark. So I walk in wearing jeans and a T-shirt (after hanging around a hospital for many hours) looking the worse for the wear. A lone oldish woman. It turns out to be a white tablecloth place with a very nicely dressed staff. A waiter greeted me and led me without hesitation to a nice table. Treated me like a valued guest and service was excellent. I had great pasta with prawns and broccolini in a light tomato based broth. Excellent rustic bread, herb butter and a perfect Chianti. I'm so grateful to have found such a respite after a long day. Thank you, Tomaso's. Highly recommend. Glad CPK had no parking!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food. Service is personal and friendly. High on the price factor, but it is what it is. Honestly, it's a place to go for specially made authentic Itialn food.  If you want cheap, go to the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Thomaso's. We got seated promptly and was given a basket of bread. It was boring, not very tasty bread...but I thought \"that's authentic, in Italy the bread is not great either.\" It came with a flavored butter that was pretty good. The waiter forgot to bring the oil until much later in the meal. The service was good in this place and really fast. I think it was the quickest meal I have ever had. We started out with the calamari. It was very bland and could have used one more minute in the fryer but the marinara sauce that came with it was great! The salad bianco was really good. The dressing was super lemony. I loved it. My main dish was ok. I got the special which was homemade penne ala vodka with langastino shrimp. It was ok. It didn't rock my world. The sauce was a bit bland, the pasta wasn't al dente  but overall the experience was good. My husband loved his linguini with clams!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. I had their Petra sole and lobster risotto, and arugula, pear, and pecan salad. Delicious. Classy place."}
{"text":"I am baffled by some of the not so stellar reviews that Tomaso's received. Aside from the ambience (love love LOVE that there are no televisions), the service was impeccable. As a first time patron, I had no idea what to expect, and in truth, I have very high expectations (my dad owned upscale Italian restaurants).  Of the five items my husband and I ordered, two were prepared specially for me (oh my, the gnocchi with meat sauce was pure heaven). Our server was knowledgeable, courteous, and funny. We had such a pleasant experience. My only regrets are that I did not ask our server's name and I didn't leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is totally underrated.  I would give this place a 4.5    I come here every time I visit Phoenix for work and it does not disappoint.  I've had their ribeye steak, their osso bucco ravioli, and their cioppino and they are all excellent.  My favorite of the three being the cioppino which I ask for a little spicy, sans the noodles.  A big plate of the seafood & tomato broth and some crusty bread is all I need.  Tomaso is still the head chef of this place and is always trying out new dishes.  The best ones make it onto their printed specials list in their menu.  The last night I ate there, he had just flown in from Italy and still went to work testing dishes.  Lots of respect for hard-workers like that."}
{"text":"We tried Tomaso's for the first time on our Anniversary. Disappointing. For the cost, I expected it to be over the top! The service was great, but the food was nothing to write home about. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for our main course.  Made 7:15 reservations for 4 of us.  Watched several groups who walked in after us get served.  Brought this to the attention of our waiter and hostess but still no food appeared until 9:40.  The restaurant was clearing out by the time we were served.    In the end, they comped our meal and wine brought dessert and a lovely chocolate liquor.  Tomaso came out and apologized at the finish of the evening as he was busy in the kitchen.  We were told we had a new waiter which added to the problems.  Such a disappointment for us locals because this is a great location, nice ambience (although a little too bright in main dining room).   We will stick with L'Amore, Franco's or Christos which offer a similar Menu but much tastier and more organized!!"}
{"text":"The Italian Region of Tuscany has given the World one of its greatest cuisines. Whether you consider yourself an aficionado or simply one who loves excellent Italian Food, and you are seeking a very special dining experience, we would like to suggest you treat yourself to an evening at Tomaso's. You will be very glad you did!  Tomaso's on Camelback is beautifully appointed and provides an elegant environment in which to thoroughly enjoy the creations of Chef Tomaso and his Staff. The Restaurant Staff is extremely professional and welcoming, very knowledgeable, and unobtrusively attentive in catering to their guests.    I was a guest of an old friend who had invited me to partner with him in a golf tournament and I wanted to treat him to a special dinner in appreciation. We both happen to share a special affinity for \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\" (a Wide Noodle Pasta in a Wild Boar Sauce) that is very difficult to find outside of Tuscany. Just on a whim, I went on Tomaso's Web Site to inquire about the possibility of them making us  \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\" one evening - Quite frankly, I didn't expect to even receive an acknowledgement of my inquiry, much less a response and that would be positive - so, what a delightful surprise it was when just a couple of hours later, I received a very warm response from Ms. Rosie Delgado, the Restaurant Manager, saying \"Chef Tomaso would be delighted to....!\" I was grinning from ear to ear and when I told my friend what was in store for us, he was as every bit as excited as I.  We arrived 15 minutes before our Reservation and when the waiter who greeted our entrance checked the computer, he grinned and said \"Ah \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\"- my favorite!\" and as he led us to our table and seated us, we both were immensely impressed that, not only were we expected but it was known for what we'd come!   Shortly after we were seated and even before we had selected a bottle of Chianti from the extensive Wine List, Chef Tomaso came to greet us and genuinely made us feel special. In addition to the requested Pappardelle, we deferred to Chef Tomaso's recommendations and we were treated to a fabulous meal that consisted of five separate courses -  an Appetizer of molten Mozzarella in a crust of perfectly seasoned bread crumbs, our specially requested  \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale\" (just like I remembered from Tuscany!), a perfect Lemon Veal Entrata, a delicious Sauvignon Dessert, concluding with a Chocolate Digestivo - each course presented and served elegantly.    Chef Tomaso returned a couple of more times, even sitting with us for a few minutes, checking in on how we were enjoying ourselves and Ms. Delgado did the same. In true European Style, we lingered in very relaxed fashion for over three hours!   Both of us have traveled the world extensively and agreed that nowhere have we experienced a better meal!  In summary.... For Fine Italian Cuisine, an Elegant Environment, Impeccable, Attentive and Accommodating Service, I highly recommend Tomaso's on Camelback.  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Just visited Tomaso's for the first time, and regret that I hadn't dined there sooner!  The tiny parking lot has free valet parking which made entry and exit very easy. Yes, my party tipped -it was hot outside!  My party arrived at 5:30, which is early, and there were just a few tables seated. As our meal progressed, the place filled to capacity and we dined on a weeknight.  We were greeted at the door with genuine warmth by several employees and were quickly taken to a table by our server. Our server was very warm, patient and gracious. Other servers kept our drinks filled and plates removed quickly and efficiently. Every need was filled immediately.  The herb butter and fresh bread were perfect. The bread was warm, chewy inside and crispy outside.  The salad with pears and gorgonzola was served in a baked parmesean bowl and featured slices of fresh bartlett pears, gorgonzola cheese, candied nuts and a house made vinaigrette. It was crisp and delicious, with a nice contrast of tart, sweet, nutty and cheesy.  The hazelnut risotto was delicious, as was the past trio. Please note that the pasta and risotto dishes are modest in size, and designed to be one course in a meal. These are not huge heaping plates. They are artful servings of great handcrafted food. Traditionally, one spends a lot of time at an Italian meal, so, courses are reasonably sized.  The pasta trio was just right for my mother who is a senior citizen and eats modest portions. She had a salad and the pasta and was very happy.  The Osso Bucco was delicious! The portion was very large and I wound up sharing partly because it was so good, but, also because it was a big plate of food. It was served in a sauce with chunky vegetables and plated on mushroom risotto.  We enjoyed the house Chianti and it was a perfect complement to the meal. Coffees were fresh and very good. We did not have dessert because we were stuffed!  Overall, this was a very solidly great dining experience; a perfect example of the best Italian fine dining."}
{"text":"Love this place! AMAZING food, so friendly and helpful with lovely, quite ambiance."}
{"text":"Very Italian menu lots of fresh use of seafood.  I had the lamb meatballs and bolonegnese and it was fantastic and hearty. Also Veal Saltambucco and it was also fantastic. Too full for dessert here!"}
{"text":"The new Tomasos just opened in our neighborhood off Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Rd. We made a reservation and were warmly greeted and promptly seated. Our waiter, Michael, arrived while we were looking over the menu and provided top notch service throughout the meal. Food was fresh and served piping hot which isn't always the case in other restaurants.  We shared the calamari which was tender and crisp along with a divine marinara sauce. My fettuccine con funghi was exceptional as was hubby's lemon veal. Run, don't walk, to dine here !"}
{"text":"Tomasos did not dissapoint this NJ native during superbowl weekend.  Their drinks were poured accurately and plentiful.    With regards to the food, the order consisted of the below: BEEF CARPACIO CHOPPED SALAD TARFELLE PASTA AND MEATBALLS (SPLIT INTO TWO ORDERS) VEAL CHOP LAMB CHOPS. ICE CREAM  The two appetizers were both enjoyed and the size was what you would expect. Not large nor small.  The pasta dish was shared and tasted amazing.  My companion had the lamb and he typically gets that at restraunts.  He said the meat was a good cut and cooked perfectly.   I had a veal chop not found on the menu and due to my improvisation no sides are listed.  They decided to give me a gnocchi pasta and potatoes.  I thought the chop was a bit small; however the cut (taking into account fat ratio and placement to the meat) was amazing.  I have to also give credit where credit is due in mentioning it was broiled perfectly as well.  We went to The Missiin, Different Pointe of View, & Tomasos during our stay and I have to say while the others were both great...Tomasos would inch out ahead if I were to make a suggestion to a friend."}
{"text":"Would give 3.5 stars. Food good but not great. Sauce for mussel appetizer was bland. Same with osso bucco & rissoto. Spouse had special: seafood ravioli & orange roughy. Fish nicely prepared but needed more sauce. Didn't care for seafood ravioli or sauce on it. Arugula pear salad was delicious. Ceasar salad was good but had better. Portions for all courses were quite generous with exception of tiramisu desert. Was delicious but very small serving. They do make a great cappicino. Atmosphere nice, service very good. Prices moderately expensive. Don't think we'll go again-better Italian places out there."}
{"text":"Had another exceptional evening at Tomaso's last night. Been here many times. Great quality food, great service. Best Italian food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar. In the bar area.  Very nice and quiet.  First class all the way. The staff really went out of there way to make me comfortable. The wine list is amazing.  The food. Just the right amount per portions  highly recommend. Any day of the week."}
{"text":"We left still hungry, very sad.   TLDR; not the best, go to Sicilian Butcher instead.   We walked in and was seated promptly. Our server was ok, nothing spectacular. I ordered the clam linguine and my husband got the veal and filet rigatoni. The sauce for the rigatoni tasted canned, we were so disappointed.   At least the Chianti was good!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!  Service was great.  Atmosphere was a little lacking-several tables nearby talking loudly-not very quiet or relaxing experience.  But the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table. Food was honestly not my favorite. We tried salad, soup, 2 entrees, and 2 deserts and nothing was worth the high price we paid. There are better places in Phoenix for Italian food."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  For Thanksgiving.  Gino was great, made great recommendations and the Tomaso red wine was wonderful.    The clam appetizer was De BOMB according to my teenagers. We had the Italian sampler, Butternut squash and Eggplant  , Chicken Parmesan, Lobster scampi ravioli and Squid Ink pasta with a Special Tomasso prepared desert platter.  A meal to remember!  GRAZZI!  The staff was amazing and attentive."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service was lacking.  We had a 5:30pm reservation and there were only three other tables with people at that time.  I couldn't tell you the waiter's name because he never told us.  Although he made a recommendation of one of the daily specials, he barely spoke to us and always seemed to be in a hurry to leave our table to do something else.  We actually had to try to find him to order a second round of drinks and dinner and he never once came back to see how we were doing or if our food was ok.  He didn't come back until we were done and the bus boy had cleared our table.  Truly unacceptible.  I will say the meatball appetizers was great!  They clearly do veal well as there were four or five veal options.  I had veal medallions which were one of the daily specials.  They were extremely tender and great taste.  The potatoes and asparagus were so-so.    Normally we order desert, coffee or after dinner drinks, but opted to get the check and go since the service was lousy.    It was also frustrating this parking lot had one handicapped parking spot right in front of the restaurant (family member in wheelchair) and right were the valet parking attendants stand. I asked if I could park there and the attendant told me he would park the car. A little annoying I have to tip someone to move my car five feet.  And a little surprising the two valet attendants stood there chatting while I got the wheelchair out of the trunk.  We valet the car often and most of the time the attendants help me with the chair, especially when we are dressed for dinner at a descent resteraunt.   To sum it up, good food, but with all the options we have in Phoenix now, we won't waste our time going back to Tomaso's ever again."}
{"text":"Best dinner I've had in a long time! I was there with my family and family friends for Mother's Day and Tomaso's had a superb special Mother's Day menu. Our family friends are from Italy and say it is authentic as you can get. The quality of food was excellent, and I was especially impressed by the Petrale sole main dish I ordered. Having worked in the seafood industry, I am a self-proclaimed fish snob, and was blown away by the quality and preparation of this fish dish. Tomaso's gets his seafood from Santa Monica Seafoods, who has a high-level reputation for quality and sustainability.   Wait staff was fun to talk with, some are Italian themselves, and I truly felt like I was back in Italy!"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, everything tasted great but I would have to say that the server was a bit rude maybe because we were young but, he gave us a dirty look when we told him we didn't want wine."}
{"text":"Excellent service & amazing food! I contacted Tomaso's a few months ago when I was searching for restaurants to host a surprise birthday dinner at. They have a few private dining rooms which is what I was looking for. Out of all of the 15+ places I contacted, this was the only one that did not have a minimum amount to reserve the room! I was shocked! Especially considering how nice this restaurant is & that smaller places were requiring $800 - $1500 minimum amounts. I worked with a lovely lady named, Vincenza, who responded to me quickly, stayed in touch throughout the weeks leading up to the party & made sure it was everything I wanted & more! All of the staff here are incredibly friendly & personable. Making all the guests laugh & feel comfortable! & of course I have to talk about the food! Amazing, homemade Italian dishes that are to die for! Thank you, Tomaso's & Vincenza for making the night so special & one that we will never forget! I will recommend you to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Arizona and I'm a native. I've been here almost 32 years and I just love coming here.  I came here once with my wife and then several months later with some coworkers. I had the same waiter (great guy with the pony tail) and he remembered what my wife had ordered months back. I couldn't believe it.   The bar is top notch. They make the best Manhattan in the valley.  This is real Italian food folks. Of course there are some negative reviews because well, some people just like The Olive Garden. You can't please everyone. If you like going to The Olive Garden, this place isn't for you. If you like to feel like you just discovered a gem in Sicily for the first time, definitely come to Tomaso's.  It's nice enough to celebrate Valentine's Day or an Anniversary here, but also cool enough to go with a group of guys to get some drinks and eat for a few hours ... Yes, you can literally spend hours here eating and drinking. They always make you feel like family.   Jason"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Went for dinner last night with the girlfriend, a friend and her mom. The appetizer we wanted was no longer on the menu, as Tomaso likes to change the menu regularly, but we asked for it anyway and our request was happily granted. We ordered a bottle of Tomaso's own red wine, Luxur 2004, fabulous! Our appetizer was lemon caper shrimp. Filet mignon was perfection, and for dessert we had fudge truffles. I asked for strawberries with the truffles and again, wish granted with zero hesitation. Everything was perfect as always. I wouldn't bring a girl here on a first date cuz it's a bit spendy for a girl that has no guarantee, but the place definitely drops panties."}
{"text":"I'm torn on if this should be a 3 star for me but honestly? I want to be impressed, but I just wasn't. My husband took me her for Valentines Day because the Lon's at the Hermosa (our favorite) was booked. Our waiter wasn't very good although he caught himself it seemed. I just figured he must not have a high respect for women due to his age and accent. Im not going to pick this review all apart but I did like the lady who sold us our bottle of wine and I liked my orange roughie. The balloons on the ceiling looked tacky and would have looked nicer if a curly string was at least attached. It was just a bad valentine decor, bad valet, bad service but great wine. It was my first time and I'm sure my last. I'm really disappointed and wouldn't ever recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We have been going to Tomaso's for at least 15 years. ALWAYS a special treat! We go for. 99% of our anniversaries, birthdays, and special evenings out. The staff is very attentive and the food is always amazing! Best seafood in town and the pastas are better! Get a bottle of Monte Olimpo Nero d'Avola or Wedell Pinot Noir, you will love them both!!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with the service here. We made a reservation through Yelp for 8pm last night, and when we got there the hostess promptly seated us. However, the room they sat us in was extremely cold, and I'm a baby when it comes to cold, so my boyfriend went back to the hostess to ask if we could get another table. She told him we'd have to wait 10-15 minutes, which we were fine with, so we headed to the bar to sit and wait.  About 30 seconds later, the hostess came back and said she had another table for us. We thought this was awesome since we were expecting to have to wait. What we soon realized is that she just wanted to get us a table quick so she could have better tables for other guests. So she proceeds to walk us to our table... And sits us at literally the worst table in the entire restaurant. It's the kind of table that you wonder why they even bothered to put it there because the location is comically horrible.  To my direct right was the kitchen. I could literally see into the door. And every time a server went in or out all I could hear was the severe loudness of the kitchen.  About 5 feet behind me was the busser station. And if you're unfamiliar with a busser station, it's where the bussers put all the trash and dirty dishes after cleaning their tables.  I can't believe this is where you would seat people in general, let alone people who made a reservation! The pasta dishes are an average of $20 per plate, so there's no way I'm going to pay around $150 for a meal for two people when I can practically reach out and touch the kitchen garbage behind me! We ended up leaving and didn't even order food, and the hostess didn't even say anything to us when she saw us leaving. Talk about a terrible experience and some really bad customer service.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I ate here last night. We're testing out places for a rehearsal dinner. The parking lot is a bit confusing during dinner since the valet cones off the lot. If you enter from the Camelback side you might have to squeeze through a sign and a cement column to get to valet. The interior of the restaurant is ok, seems a bit dated but not too bad. Our experience seemed to be a bit rushed. It felt like as soon as our plates were cleared then next course was on the table. The bread and I assume pesto butter was delightful. The service was OK  but the waiter seemed to rush us and did not really explain any of the menu or tell us the daily vegetable. We had lobster bisque was decent, not the best I've ever had. The dish was so hot that it burned my tongue. For our main dishes, we had the mixed grill and the ribbon pasta with mushroom and truffle. The mixed grill comes with a link of in house made sausage, lamb chops, and a filet. The portions were decent. The waiter neglected to ask me how I would like my filet when I ordered, so it came out well done and the taste of the beef not pleasurable. The best thing by far of the night was the lamb chop. It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The sausage link was so-so. My fiancee's dish was interesting. The mushroom-truffle part was tasty, but the ribbon pasta tasted like something from Hamburger Helper. I know they make it in house, but the pasta was not what I was expecting. For dessert, we tried the pistachio cheese cake and caramel chocolate cake. The dishes were respectable but nothing to elevate it from the crowd."}
{"text":"Food here is so good.   The Atmosphere is just average all white tablecloth and open room.  Can be A little noisy. But food wise it's one of the best Italian places you can find in PHX"}
{"text":"When we lived in Paradise Valley we used to go to Tomaso's often but we moved further away and it had been a few years since our last visit.    So happy to be able to say again, Tomaso's remains one of Phoenix's best Italian restaurants.  We went with some friends on Christmas Eve and the service was friendly, attentive...excellent.  The food was as good, if not better than we remembered.  All four of us loved the service, loved the environment and couldn't stop complimenting the food.   By comparison, we had been invited to Christo's Italian restaurant a few months earlier and that dining experience did not remotely compare, in any way, to Tomaso's.    I highly recommend Tomaso's.  We loved it so much...we're going back on New Years Eve."}
{"text":"As good as it gets; superb food, atmosphere, service. Try it during Restaurant Week when you can sample favorites"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service great, good wine list, but way too large a markup on the wine."}
{"text":"The lunch we had at Tomaso's was so amazing that I had to write about it!  This was my first experience at Tomaso's so I did not know what to expect.  I have always heard great things about Tomaso's but had no idea it would be this good!   We started off the meal with a shrimp appetizer - the shrimp was sautéed in a lemon caper butter sauce and tasted so good.   Then we ordered our lunch entree -  rigatoni Amatrciana and veal parmiggiano.  The pasta was cooked to perfection, sauce was amazing and the veal was so tender it practically melted in my mouth.  We even decided to splurge on dessert - a wild berry tart which was light and delicious - perfect with an espresso.  If this is what lunch is like at Tomaso's, I can hardly wait to check it out for dinner!  Definitely my new favorite Italian restaurant!  Tomaso's is perfect for a business lunch and I know it will be the perfect date night dinner spot.  The wait staff in the restaurant was very attentive to our needs and made sure we were well taken care of without being overbearing.   Tomaso even came out and introduced himself and asked how everything was which has never happened to me before. I can't wait to come back - very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I met my sister and her husband there last month for my birthday. The place seemed very nice but unfortunately I had an unrelated medical emergency after just a few bites. The staff got involved and went way above and beyond in order to help. They called the police and tended to me while the ambulance was en route. Can't tell you how great they were, so a big thank you to those involved!  As a follow up I just ordered some takeout and turns out the food is pretty good too! The veal in the large portioned veal parmigiana was unique and tasted great."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The entire staff was friendly. The food came out fairly quickly especially considering that the restaurant was so busy. Our waiter was very attentive. Luckily, the service does not outshine the taste of the food. I got a pasta with shrimp and lobster and it was absolutely delicious. I loved it. My girlfriend got some sort of eggplant and she said it was really good. My mother in law got the lasagna and it was also super good. We didn't know much about this place but now I know I will recommend it to anyone who visits Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant as I was directed to it by my friend and fellow Yelper, Donald S., and oh...my...God...was the squash ravioli at Tomasos AWESOME!  It was perfect.  It arrived quickly, was presented well, was a good portion for lunch, and geezuz, the sauce was to die for!  It was a bit expensive for lunch, but those of you who know me, know that I say that at almost every meal.  I'm cheap, what can I say?  Oh, I forgot the bread!  It was perfectly baked and came with the most wonderful herb butter.  For bread lovers, this will be on the top of your list!  I highly recommend this restaurant, and I can't wait to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Tomaso's the other night, and found it to be a very solid meal. I was able to secure a table without a reservation, though that may be always possible, especially on the weekends.  The wine list is extensive and impressive, including a nice selection of wines by the glass. Unfortunately they do not stock any of the great craft beers coming out of Italy. I started with a Tuscan bean soup that was good, though lacking in anything exciting. For my main, I had a daily special that was a house made swiss chard and kale ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese, with a balsamic demi-glaze.  Service was attentive, but not smothering. Overall very good dinner."}
{"text":"I recently attended a Winemaker Dinner at Tomaso's featuring Tomaso's wines from Sicily.  The Winemaker Dinner was sold out and all of the guests who attended were very festive and lively.  It felt more like a family gathering than a Winemaker Dinner.  Throughout the evening, guests mingled about the room and it was a very fun and social environment.     The dinner featured strictly Sicilian dishes and was not your typical Italian fare. The menu consisted of stuffed artichokes, gnudi, swordfish roulade, mixed grill and Cassatelle con Ricotta as dessert. According to the Sicilians in the room, the dinner was authentic Sicilian style.  I love dining at Tomaso's and just wanted to spread the good word again. I have attended several of Tomaso's Wine Dinners and the event on June 23, 2012 was one of the best wine dinners Tomaso has put together.  As far as I could tell, everyone at the wine dinner had an amazing time and enjoyed the food immensely.  There were a lot of empty plates going back to the kitchen.  There was plenty of laghter and the atmosphere was jovial. Tomaso even gave a couple of speeches and was very humorous.  As always, Tomaso came through with an amazing Winemaker Dinner that was so much fun.  Bravo to Tomaso's!!!!"}
{"text":"We like this place. Because we don't live nearby we dine here once or twice a year.   We enjoyed lunch today. I love the linguine vongole.  We will be back. I was a little frustrated by wine price: we had a nice wine for $49 but I recognized it as a $26 wine at an Italian restaurant near our Oregon home. Of course this was white tablecloths and wonderful service so I suppose  high priced wine supports it"}
{"text":"Great place and wonderful food! The waiters are fantastic and the whole setting really gives off an authentic feeling."}
{"text":"This was my absolute first time at Tomaso's. What an experience!  From the moment I walked in I was greeted very pleasantly by the hostess and three staff members.   Staff were extremely knowledgeable of the wines as well as the menu items. Some spoke very heavy Italian...I don't; but it didn't pose a problem. After my arrival, the place filled quickly; ranging from couples to eight member parties. Noise was at a minimal.  I began my dining experience by having a glass of resieling as I admired  the artwork, lighting, furniture, etc. and soaked up my surroundings. I noticed that every occupied table had a bottle of wine on it... except mine.  Meal options: I chose to start with the Fiori di Zucca - stuffed zucchini blossom with organic ricotta, basil & mozzarella. Talk about a treat for your palate! For an entree, I chose the Menage a Trois -  lobster, scallops, and shrimp in a savory fresh tomato sauce, olives & basil; served on linguine. Yum. Yum!  Everything was on point and served in a timely fashion.  I was please with the entire experience. I recommend Tomaso's for special occasions or for those that missing true authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"Finally authentic Sicilian food in Phoenix. Combine it with great service and it is a classic go to restaurant.  If you haven't been to Tomaso's what are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing evening and dinner at Tomaso's. Our server Joe made the overall experience so amazing that we can't wait to come back! His recommendations (veal bolognese & seafood tomato dish) were absolutely delicious. It was our two year anniversary and he made made it a point to treat us to a specialty dessert on the house. Service, food, experience, ambiance, and service are all a solid 10/10!! Thanks Joe!!"}
{"text":"Food was dynamite, drinks were dynamite, service was dynamite, and the chocolate mousse was dynamite. The whole experience was really a 6 Star review but I can only do up to 5 stars. It truly was an authentic Italian food dining experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Italian experience."}
{"text":"Last minute for lunch, in the area, we were seated immediately. Beautiful establishment. Peaceful, quiet. Not so busy for lunch. Staff seems distant, to be expected, I guess. Today we had Mozzarella Tasting Caprese, artistic presentation, tastes average. The Italian Wedding Soup is disappointing ~ bland & needs more meatballs (I'm really not a big eater either). But I can share with you the \"silver lining\" to this dreary day: The House Made Sicilian Sausage ~ The most flavorful sausage served with a sauteed mixture of bell peppers, onions & pine nuts all in this wonderful, hearty, robust glaze!!! It's definitely going to be the reason I'll go back - maybe for take out."}
{"text":"Delicious food but rude servers. We didn't like him so we left a tip accordingly. After ten minutes Our server came outside to stop us halfway of the parking lot to tell us we left a bad tip and asked us \"was there something wrong about my service?\" Ended up telling us he didn't like us. It was as if we had no right to leave the cost of our tip. It's how we felt about the service and I don't think we should be judged for it. But food was good. Just hope you don't have the old Italian man with a pony tail as your server. He may chase you out the door to complain about your tip."}
{"text":"I went to Tomaso's as my 1st Restaurant Week stop. The service was absolutely great! I sat at the bar with a great bartender, Robin. He was knowledgeable and very excited about food, just like me.  When I mentioned I needed to skip dessert, he was happy to substitute and Italian wedding soup! That was very generous! It had no pasta, which is unusual for a wedding soup. Instead, diced white meat chicken took its place next to traditional and delicious little meatballs.  I came specifically for the zucchini blossoms, and they didn't disappoint! Beautiful, tasty, even the stems! Though I think they could have used a bit more salt. And after all that, I forgot to take their photo!  The shrimp on the shrimp and lobster ravioli was amazing!! Very meaty, no fishy flavor whatsoever, and the lemon sauce was perfect! The ravioli had a clear clean lobster flavor and perfect tooth bite.  #eatARW"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try the food here since it's come so highly recommended. Did not disappoint.  Felt like being in Italy with the great atmosphere and the staff.  Will go back many times."}
{"text":"Sadly, I did not find this place to be as tasty as I hoped or for the prices either.    However, I thought it was going to be uber good because of menu choices and descriptions...and the prices.  But prices lie sometimes...or a lot!  Oh and perhaps because their pesto butter that they give with their bread basket was yuuuuuuuuuumy!    We went for a friend's birthday dinner and so we shared the fried mozarella balls with anchovy sauce and capers.  Now that was tasty!    I got the filet mignon ravioli with veal demi sauce, aromatic vegetables, truffle, and parmaggiano.  Sigh.  The raviolis were good, but I was expecting parmaggiano melted on top and more of a taste variety.  The first few bites were tasty, but I quickly became bored with it.  I did nosh on my friend's seafood ravioli (which were pretty good since it had a cream sauce) and a bit of another friend's veal.  I've had mouth-watering melt-in-your-mouth veal in Sorrento, Italy...so that is what I was hoping for and expecting.  Not so much. See my attached photo...there certainly isn't much to it, very 2-dimensional.    This one was a definitely let down for sure.  And for the pricetag, I'm not happy to not have enjoyed it more.  There seems to be a very old crowd here as well.    Our server was very friendly and helpful as well.  I was afraid not to finish off my last ravioli though, even though I was full, because he would give us a hard time if we didn't finish things on our plate.  Gotta love Europeans!  I remember that happening often when I traveled all over Europe awhile back.  LOL"}
{"text":"Great uncomplicated Italian food.  Reminds you of bit of stepping back in time to the \"Rat Pack\" era.  I have been able to find some Sicilian dishes here I have not been able to find elsewhere.  Service has always been fantastic and have loved whatever I have ordered."}
{"text":"A few friends joined me at the bar last night and we had a very nice experience.  Tomaso was there but spent most of his time watching over the kitchen and serving staff - as he should.  After 40 years he has opened this second location in North Scottsdale.  While we have a handful of other Italian restaurants in close proximity, I can comfortably predict this will become the local favorite.   A few kinks need to be worked out, but that's perfectly understandable being open for just a few days.  We saw a server move the bowl of grated parmesan cheese from one person that just finished his spaghetti to another that just had some arrive.  That's not like a bottle of ketchup and should not be shared amongst customers.  I know fresh grated parmesan reggiano is expensive and shouldn't be wasted - but the server should sprinkle it on the food for the customer and take it away - unless that customer requests to keep it.   Everyone I spoke to loved their food.  His prices are about 10-20% lower than Spiga, Pane e Vino and Gianfranco's nearby.  The only complaint I hear over & over again was his high prices for cocktails.  My rum & coke cost $11.00.  Only nearby Mastro's charges that high a price, but it's a much more generous pour at Mastro's.  Most other high quality restaurants in the area charge between $7-$8 for the same drink.  Tomaso needs to address this because his 30+ seats at the bar will generate at least 20-25% of his business in this part of town if he does it right. Finally, I noticed a few staffers that came from other restaurants in the area.  The waiter John was with Pane e Vino for 15 years.  I stopped going there a few years ago because of the new owner, but missed having John wait on us.  I was sure glad to see him again.  A true professional!  Good luck Tomaso.  We're glad you're here."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! This is not \"Americanized Italian\" food. The pasta dishes are far from ordinary & full of flavor. The Fava Bean Salad was incredible, it's a seasonal food item, but a must have! The service was great with professional/friendly staff. The restaurant is great for a romantic night out, business dinner, or for casually chilling at the bar. I am bringing my family here the next time they come to visit."}
{"text":"In business for over 30 years, this authentic Italian restaurant is one not to be missed. Linen tables and hometown Italian hospitality fill the restaurant. Oil vinegar and Bread came to the table within 15 seconds of our sitting. Gino, our fabulous waiter made us feel right at home. Get the Caesar salad with a parmesan crusted shell! Delicious. We had spaghetti ala o'glio. Not on the menu, but it's just garlic and oil sautéed over spaghetti. Excellent service, atmosphere and food. Ask for Gino, he's great:)"}
{"text":"I visited Tomaso's with my brother and fiance, while my fiance and I were visiting from out of town. We really wanted a nice Italian dinner on our last evening in town, and Tomaso's did not disappoint! It's not the trendy American-Italian (which I actually really enjoy) - its more old-school, white tablecloth style. Both are awesome in their own way!  Our server, Arturo, was amazing. He was really helpful with recommendations and we didn't feel rushed at all. We were probably there for over two hours... which is fine by me when doing this style of dining. Our appetizer, Crudo Carpaccio, was a steal at $12 and a great way to start the meal. We each ordered different items with the Osso Buco being the favorite at the table. It was so flavorful and unbelievably tender.   For dessert we had cannoli, profiteroles, and tiramisu - you can't go wrong with any of them. They were all so good!  If you're looking for a traditional Italian spot, check out Tomaso's! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tomaso's has just taken the spot of my number one Italian restaurant this side of san francisco. I was lucky to have been taken there by my husband a week or so ago for a date night. Tomaso's was booked solid so I was excited he scored a reservation. We decided to arrive a little early and have a glass of wine at the quaint bar. The list is ample with lots of varietals of wines. The bartender was very friendly and accommodating. At our reservation time we were shown to our table. I was surprised how large the restaurant was when our table was in the 'back' of the restaurant. It just seems smaller from the street! Tomaso's is all class with white linen tables and napkins and squared tables. Our waiter greeted us and shared the nights specials: Cioppino and a Veal Chop served Parmigiana style over pasta. Being from the bay area, winning me over with cioppino can be difficult.. so, in truth, I was skeptical. We started with the Charcuterie Antipasto  plate with various Italian salumi; Italian cheeses; olives and amazing grilled artichoke hearts.Our waiter also brought us a basket of house made warm crusty bread and a garlicky basil butter; this was divine. Despite Tomaso's being full on reservations this particular night we were not rushed while we sipped our Super Tuscan wine and nibbled on the charcuterie. The grilled artichokes are knock your socks off good! Finally, after much deliberation, we decided to order. I had to have the Lobster Bisque that was described as having diced lobster within it.. This bisque is heavenly if you like creamy, hearty soups like me. It was rich and filling and full of lobster. On this particular night a Chicken Parmigiana was being served and as much as I wanted to try the Cioppino, (as it was served next to us and it was amazing looking with what looked like an entire lobster tail !), I went with one of my favorites! My husband ordered my second favorite : Maialino Osso Buco. I can't even begin to describe how amazing both dishes were . My meal was very ample in amount and my husband's shank was so tender it was falling off the bone. We both had leftovers to take home! We were so full we did not have desserts and continued to enjoy this very relaxed and mainly, unrushed romantical night out at Tomaso's. I simply was amazed by how great the service was; how we were never rushed on this very popular night ; how awesome the food was and it's presentation, as well. Tomaso's was all I had hoped for on a night out to celebrate a milestone in our relationship with my now husband and they helped make it perfect! I can't wait to return to savor more Italian food here soon!"}
{"text":"EVERYONE GET THE LOBSTER RAVIOLI! Best Italian food I've had in a long time. Even though my mom and I weren't in the proper attire we were treated the same as everyone else. If I ever visit Arizona again, I'll be sure to stop by again!"}
{"text":"SUCH a disappointing night. This was a dinner we had long awaited, my grandfather and father flew in from Chicago to celebrate turning 90 and 60, as well as I turned 30. My youngest sister also flew in as a surprise. The dinner started fine and service steadily declined. At one point we didn't see our waiter in over 20 minutes and our food took an hour to come out. These two factors combined really killed the mood at our table, as my grandfather was upset which in turn upset my dad. Additionally, the atmosphere definitely lacks compared to other restaurants of the same price caliber. In all, for the price, mediocre food, and terrible service, I would not return. There are so many other restaurants with fabulous food and service that would have made our celebrations what they should have been."}
{"text":"From the options to taste to service to ambiance, I loved this small Italian restaurant! I had the eggplant and squash ravioli and loved it! They also have a great wine list and some different desserts you do not see at every Italian restaurant. I have only been once when visiting for work, but I would go again the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! They make you feel like your part of the family. The pastas are like your grandparents used to make. Always a stop when visiting Arizona! Such a gem in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant. Food was beyond amazing. It was nice to meet other Italians and talk about our beautiful county.  Buonissimo! Grazie mille e ci vediamo in Sicilia!"}
{"text":"good Italian place... the menu has some unique things and they do a good job... it is pretty expensive but for specials occasions it is good.  Zac is right about the accents... but it adds to the flavor and the pesto butter is pretty good as well..."}
{"text":"This is the Mother Ship for Italian restaurants.  I've been dining at Tomaso's for the past 13 years and I always know I can count on perfection.  The restaurant is comfortable, clean and the food outstanding.  The food is authentic Italian and if I could give the quality of each and every meal a higher rating than 5 stars, I would give it a 10!  Their portions are generous and Tomaso oversees each dish that leaves his kitchen.  He is a hands on owner who greets his customers with open arms.  His staff follows his perfection as well.  Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day or any day, this restaurant always amazes me with their menu.  There are many choices and they are never boring.  It is truly a favorite of mine.  If you're a sports nut, you will find many familiar faces at this establishment."}
{"text":"Really, really good Italian food and wine.  Can be a bit stuffy of a vibe sometimes, but that is somewhat due to the area they are in.  The butter that comes with the bread is amazing, and then I'd recommend the pasta bolognese that has the mushrooms in it"}
{"text":"It is a cute little restaurant, has a nice wine list.  I ordered the Linguine with clam Sauce, and a glass of pino.  Personally i think the food is actually pretty good, nice northern italian.  But the service was just ok."}
{"text":"Arrived earlier than our reservations and were seated by 645, didnt get our food until 830 and our order was screwed up. When we addressed the manager he insulted what we ordered and was incredibly rude. I was this close to calling my local godfather to ask for a favor. Maybe if the food was better I would have even slightly understood, but it was nothing to scream about and we were treated more than poorly. Would give a 0/5 if possible."}
{"text":"If you know real Italian then Tomaso's is where you want to eat. The owner Tomaso himself has created a menu and environment with a real Italian fare. I have been eating here for years and have never left disappointed. Matter of fact I dined their last night and left with a stuffed belly and a sole on my face.   I sat at the bar which had the football game playing. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable of the items only the menu. Tomaso was in the house as well. Always friendly and comes by to greet the patrons. I was given some warm fresh homemade bread with some of Tomasos own brand of fresh olive oil. By the way it is the best. He makes his own olive oil and various types of wines which are presented in a full stocked bar.    What I like most is he offers more then he typical Italian resturant options and seasonal dishes. There is something for all dietary needs. I have some food allergies and this Resturant will customize your order.   There is a small room for private parties that can be closed off to the patrons. Decorate classy with top notch customer service."}
{"text":"A Phoenix landmark and with good reason. From the moment you walk in the door- you're \"home\". Want something a little different or maybe off the menu? No problem but the menu is filled with a lifetime full of variety.  Our server, Evan, was on top of everything and extremely friendly and entertaining- ask for him. The food? Well- it's perfect. Try the lasagna and change your life :-)  We even had the great man himself stop over to greet us, poured us a drink of his own creation and welcomed my wife and I to our new favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  It's a classic- believe me. Going back? Of course :-)"}
{"text":"Great service! Okay food! Had not been there in a while! Either the food used to better I have just become more of a foodie!  Its not that its bad food. Its okay for me. Its is authentic Italian with fresh pastas etc. but my husband makes his own pasta so I am spoiled."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in Arizona. It's a cozy neighborhood joint with world class food. I've been to Tomaso's numerous times and I always kick myself for not going more often.  Last time I was there I went with my father. And, like always, as I was looking over the menu I couldn't believe how low some of the prices were for the quality of the food I knew they had. We started with the Fillet Mignon Carpaccio, with I could've eaten ten of. We ordered the Osso Bucco for the main course, which was $22. It was out of this world! It literally falls off the bone it's so tender - to the point I was wondering how they got it on the plate without it falling apart.   Everything was wonderful. The only knock I really had was the price of our after dinner Limoncello's. Our Negroni's during the meal were the typical $10 which is perfectly normal. But when we got the 1.25 oz Limoncello's they were $10 a piece as well. A price I was taken back by but perfectly willing to pay for the quality of the meal we had.   I highly suggest you check out this world class gem! Tomaso has been there every time I've dined there, and even though I'm not a regular, he always stops by to talk and ask how things are. A very nice man. This place will continue to be my suggestion for when people ask me where to get good Italian food. It's also one of the best \"date night\" restaurants I've ever seen - very romantic."}
{"text":"Happened upon this restaurant as we were visiting from out of town. My husband had the grilled filet mignon and said it was one of the best he's ever had. I had the cavatelli with lamb meatballs. It was to die for. There was no fettuccini on the menu but the server had some prepared for the kids. The noodles were so fresh and light. Happy family here!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed.  I was hoping for some fresh, tasty homemade pasta and instead found a menu full of heavy meals (lots of meatballs, lobster and steak).  And it was much more than I was expecting to spend - all together $50+ for a glass of wine, a salad, and pasta.    I should have known when I pulled up to the place, which looked like a closed-up men's club.  I think I was one of the few women in the place and certainly the youngest person in the room.  Most tables seemed full of older couples and older men doing power dinners.  I think I confused the wait staff, walking in by myself (I was in Phoenix on a business trip and craving pasta).  I scanned the menu, hoping for something light and fresh...which was a no go.  I ended up ordering a special, black linguine with seafood.  The linguine itself (and the sauce) was actually pretty tasty.  However the amount of seafood was overwhelming and I had to dig out the pasta.  The salad was okay - a Caesar served in a parmesan shell, which was a nice touch.  Overall,  I would give Tomaso's 2.5 stars.  The service was great (although my waiter seemed unsure what to do with a single woman at his table) but the food was only so-so for the amount of money I spent.  Like I said, disappointing."}
{"text":"Having lived in the Valley for 15 years, we finally made it to Tomaso's, a restaurant I have heard about for years. It was not a special night, just a Saturday date night with my husband. We walked in at 7:30 pm with no reservation. That should have been a sign that we shouldn't eat here.  The food was way over priced, especially for what it was. I had the spaghetti cacio y Pepe and my husband had lemon shrimp. His was delicious, but mine tasted very basic. (Yes, it is an easy dish, but I have had carefully crafted ones at other restaurants and been blown away).   The wine poor was generous. We went with the recommendations of the waiter, but was disappointed when he tried to pass off a stale glass of wine. When I asked him how long the bottle had been open, he made a scene to send over the bartender, tell me it was not stale and pour a new glass 'from the same bottle'... It was a completely different wine they poured us the second time. Tired, I didn't want to make a scene, we accepted it and let it sit on the table.  By the end, we just wanted to leave and our waiter was slow to bring the check. Other tables that he was serving were all eyeing one another as well, looking for sympathy.  It was a sad way to spend $100, I wish we would have gone to North or Hillstone, where the food is always good."}
{"text":"This review has to do with a group function, specifically a holiday party for my company. I have personally planned holiday parties for the past 16 years. I have never been in a situation where my wishes for two drink coupons per guest was not honored. My company has been willing to purchase two alcoholic beverages per person and any other drinks ordered are from a cash bar purchased by the guest. This restaurant had bottles of wine free flowing without a drink coupon. They actually took over how the alcoholic beverages were dispersed. One waiter even told a staff member, \"don't worry about it, your company is paying \". Unfortunately, it was a family member not someone that felt like that was a positive thing.  Very poor management of my contract and wishes for 40 people."}
{"text":"Tomaso's is a great old-school, white tablecloth, non-stuffy Italian place. I'm not Italian, but my fiancé and soon to be bro-in-law are, and this is the kind of place that their grandfather would take them to. We were in from Pittsburgh visiting, and wanted to have a nice dinner and bottle (or two) of wine before we left town. Tomaso's didn't disappoint. From the Crudo Carpaccio to the Osso Buco to the Cannolis, tiramisu, etc. the whole meal was absolutely delicious!   Our server, Arturo, was very helpful along the way, and we ended up telling family stories and spent 2+ hours at the restaurant. At no point did we feel rushed to get out of the restaurant. It was a fantastic evening, and we will certainly be back when in town!"}
{"text":"Best Italian in Phoenix! A little bit pricy but totally worth it ! Good service ! The chocolate mousse cake is to die for !"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Many of us felt like the food looked better than it tasted. Nice atmosphere and wonderful service. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Perfezione! This little restaurant is the epitome of fine Italian dining!  There's nothing more genuine than Tomaso's. We called this restaurant when they were scheduled to close in a half hour, but when we expressed how excited we were to enjoy a meal there the manager agreed to stay open until we had finished.   Upon arrival the door was held open and we were warmly greeted and seated amongst a few other late night diners who were finishing up. The waiter had just finished rowing his gondola from Venice, his accent thick like a finely formulated Bolognese sauce. He delivered the fine red wine we ordered like a master sommelier and took our requests for appetizers patiently. La vita bella!  After we sampled four of their finest appetizers (which were all prepared to perfection), we decided it was time to move into the main course. There were many different dishes ordered: seafood diablo pasta, grilled fish, steak, lobster tail, shrimp, lamb, sea scallops! Everything was cooked with an excellence that could only be matched by the almighty himself. I enjoyed the Tuscan Mixed Grill, which itself was one of the greatest dishes I've ever had. I did, in the tradition of Italian family-style dining, HAVE to try a little bit of everything though...  Topped off with a little dessert dessert wine, this meal could not have been served or prepared better. Tomaso's is a great place to go if you want to get the best Italian food possible."}
{"text":"The food is good but not great.  I prefer this as a happy hour place and no so much as a dinner place.  The bread is delicious and hot.  The calamari is reliable.  The food in general is reliable but I don't view this as a destination place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went here on Thursday to check out the new summer menu specials and it did not disappoint. We failed to make reservations but were offered a short wait time or the full service bar. Opted for the bar as I couldn't wait to get my mouth on a decent chianti - yum! We enjoyed squid ink seafood pasta, decadent lobster raviolis, and a strawberry cream dessert. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal at Tomaso's.  Nice atmosphere and pleasant waiter.  We had a \"light meal\".... Caeser salad followed by pasta (carbonara and special) and great Tuscan wine.   We avoided the valets and found a space in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Eight of us dined at Tomaso's on a Sunday evening in March. Our table was understandably a large one, but soon after we were seated a few other large parties arrived as well.  Our waiter was pleasant but unattentive. He frequently forgot to collect everyone's orders as he went around the table. On more than one occasion, he placed drinks or dishes in front of the wrong person - something you expect at Denny's but not at a restaurant of this caliber. We had to search for him frequently to refill water or iced tea glasses. He failed to deliver promised second glasses of wine to two in our party, but somehow did remember to put them on the bill.  Before the meal started, we had asked for the bill to be split in half, and he gladly agreed. But he delivered a single bill. When we reminded him that we requested two bills, gave us a sour face and took a long time to bring split checks. However, the way he split the checks was incorrect and quite frankly (despite several college degrees at the table) unintelligible.   When we FINALLY got him to come by and explained that the split was done incorrectly, he blamed us, made it seem like we were being unreasonable, and then brought back the check split differently - but still incorrectly.   In the end, although the food was good, we left with a bitter taste about the restaurant. What kind of wait staff makes the customer feel bad about a problem the wait staff has?   The food was good, but none of us will subject ourselves to this terrible service again."}
{"text":"We've been dining at Tomaso's before we even officially moved to this area five years ago. Over the years, they have never disappointed. They go above and beyond to make us feel special. They are one of the few places in town willing to cater to you, even creating special dishes. I want give a huge thank you to the kitchen, Robin and entire staff for going above and beyond on our to go order Tuesday evening. They specially made several dishes for us. They even made my favorite gnocchi, which I hadn't had in a couple years. Spinach ricotta stuffed gnocchi in a Truffle pistachio sauce, I could eat that dish everyday. The veal chop was excellent, as well as the Veal Parm. The trio of ravioli and lobster ravioli were outstanding. We really enjoyed the delicious surf and turf creation. Desserts were excellent as always. Thank you so much, we absolutely adore this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for Valentine's Day.  I am thinking the tip off to it not being good is the fact we could get reservations when I called the evening prior.   I asked for a 6:30 reservation, and I was given the options of 6:15 or 6:45.   I picked the 6:45, got there early, and we didn't have to wait.  In fact, there were empty tables. ...  Oscar was our server.   Nice guy.  Professional.  The thing I saw that was a bit disturbing is the fact that when he opened a bottle of wine at a table close to us, the top of the foil fell to the floor.   He kicked it under the table.   Huhhh??  Is that what servers do?    Also, another table next to us had a folded napkin under one of the legs.   I would imagine to keep it from wobbling.  I would think, if they are going to do that how about a less conspicuous color since it readily stood out.  On to my meal.   I ordered the house salad.   I was thinking I should have ordered the dressing on the side.   I mean, it wasn't bad but there was so much that it made me cough -- maybe cause of the vinegar? -- and was completely saturated!  I think I was having salad in my dressing. ...   My table mate had the caesar's salad.   I am thinking I should have ordered that.  I ordered their Silver Oak cab, which is a 2013.   Not a bad bottle of wine.   I looked it up at Total Wine to see what the markup is.  Not bad.  A nice heavy body wine.  We perused the menu.   He decided to get the RIGATONI WITH VEAL & FILET MIGNON BOLOGNESE and I got their special, which I think is similar to the LINGUINE AMALFITANI.   It had all kinds of shell fish: shrimp, lobster, clams, mussels.  I can't remember what else.  I tasted his.   He didn't particularly care for it and neither did I.   It sort of looked like a bad version of spaghetti with meat sauce, and the taste was, well, interesting. ...   I thought not at all palatable.   And I mean it.  My dish, I think had the same sauce.   I concentrated on eating the shell fish.  The shrimp was tough as was the lobster.  Cooked a bit too long??  Thankfully, it didn't have much of the sauce.  He is Sicilian; therefore, I asked if he would return.   He said no.  He would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe they were busier than normal cause of it being Valentine's Day.   Uhmmmm.   No."}
{"text":"Holy amazingness!!!!!! If I lived in the area, this would be my favorite spot!!! I can't tell you what dish I enjoyed the most: the ravioli was to die for, the lobster risotto was the best I've ever had, and the steak, lamb, and sausage main course nearly had me in tears for savoring every bite. If you are ever in Phoenix you must check out this landmark restaurant! My pops could not rave enough about his gluten-free pasta!! Thanks Tomaso for foodie's dream night of eating!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal meal. The salad was crisp and fresh and the dressing was flavorful. And it was dressed appropriately. Some places only put a few squirts but this was on all parts of the salad. I wanted to sip it up with the bread. The pasta course also had a delicious sauce, pasta a nice al dente with gave beans, artichokes and fresh peas. Moving on to the entree another delicious offering. The eggplant piled with ricotta and a marina with 3 delicious homemade butternut squash. Just the right amount of heat to balance the eggplant. The desert was two HUGE strawberries with a dollop of marscapone and a sprinkling of white and milk chocolate what tasted like a small malted milk ball. The waitstaff was attentive and kept all the glasses filled, the room temp comfortable, and the food delivered timely. Tomaso's has been here for years and the only thing that is hard is on a busy night if you don't valet parking lot is super small. But I would walk blocks to come here again!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some good Italian food, so we decided to visit Tomaso's. The entire experience was unsatisfactory. You have to park in an awkward lot arranged so that you have to turn out and then back in before you find the Valet. Our waiter vacillated between hovering at the hostess station while staring at us to ignoring us completely. The salad turned out to be canned pears atop wilted lettuce with an odd topping of fried onion strings. The pasta was good, but not worth the $20 asking price. The dessert and coffee were served with no spoons, so we were forced to go foraging for extra silverware at a neighboring empty table. Finally, we had to wait at least five minutes at the valet station for the attendant to arrive back from his break.   On a Saturday night the restaurant was more than half empty, so the waiter really had no excuse. Luckily, his counterpart who was serving the next table over took pity on us and refilled our bread basket and water glasses, offered us fresh ground pepper for our appetizer, and  answered our questions about the dishes our own waiter had abruptly plunked down in front of us before bolting back to the hostess station.   While the experience here gave us a lot to laugh about, we will not be returning to Tomaso's."}
{"text":"Mangia! Most excellent Italian food!  Enjoy a leisurely evening dining at Tomaso.  And try their wine - the one from his vineyard in Italy - amazingly fine."}
{"text":"We found this place by searching online for good Italian food in Phoenix. It seems more upscale than it is. You don't have to be super dressed up to come here, but I wouldn't recommend walking in with flip flops and a tank top.  Everything that I tried here was amazing. Even starting with the bread with the herb butter. I could not stop eating it!! It was so good, and the bread stayed warm the entire time we sat there. I order the short rib with the mushroom risotto, while my aunt ordered the caesar and the lasagna. My 7 year old cousin ordered spaghetti and meatballs because well she's 7. Everything we had was so flavorful. The caesar salad is made with the a parmesan shell, so you get that nice bite of crisp cheese.  The short rib was fork tender, there was no need for any knives at this table. The lasagna....OMG perfect mix of tomato, cheese, and meat. This is probably the first time that I can remember in a long time that I didn't need to add salt and pepper to a dish. It was perfectly seasoned from the first bite. The hardest thing I would say here is to decide what you want to eat because everything looks good.   Of course, we had to do a dessert so I had a cannoli, while they shared a bombolini (?) . Whatever they had was great, but it didn't hold a candle to my cannoli with espresso.   I can't leave this review without mentioning that the service from start to finish was amazing. They were very kind, welcoming, and informative. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Here for Valentine's Day dinner, the place was packed. Had a short wait at the bar, they mix a mean Manhattan (with Maker's Mark as the well bourbon). Got seated, wait staff was attentive and professional. Courses were paced perfectly. Had the stuffed clams, 2 large shells perfectly prepared. Lobster bisque with nice chunks of lobstery goodness. Shrimp-lobster-langostino fra diavolo in a tomato-seafood stock base over perfectly al dente linguini. Had a bite or two of my dates pear salad, that was awesome, too. This place isn't cheap, but the experience and food are well worth it. I wish more restaurants around the Valley had their commitment to the service side of dining....."}
{"text":"Great location for large groups. We had The Sicilian dinner and it was amazing from start to finish. Great service and Great food! I will always recommend it to anyone with a large group or romantic night out!"}
{"text":"We just went to Tomaso's on Valentine's Day and I will tell you their food there is to die for! I had the scallops and lobster pasta with red sauce and it was delicious. I had not had lobster that I have liked since we went on our trip to the Breakers and that was a 5 star restaurant and you are walking away with a $600 bill. Tomaso's was very reasonably priced and their food was 5 stars! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is their delicious herb infused butter.  Where to start...I absolutely detest restaurants that do not keep online menus current.  We sat and the menu was nothing compared to what was online.  The service was okay...our waiter tried...but honestly we had to crumb our own table etc.  the staff never removed plates or utensils from courses etc.  It was like stepping into a Service Bermuda Triangle.  I saw the older couple next to us was treated normally.  Which is odd...my wife and I do not look poor...at all.  So it's not an age vs wealth discrimination as mentioned in other reviews.  I think they depend on \"regulars\" who they cater to.  The crowd was geriatric.  We really wanted to leave but the waiter convinced us to stay.  Despite ordering surf and turf with no breading or cheese due to voiced dietary restrictions we were served battered & fried lobster as a substitute.  The lamb osso buco was inedible...which I ordered due to recommendation.  The caprese salad was served sans balsamic vinegar.  Homemade pasta was also really not good.  My wife had to cut her steak with a butter knife because no one brought a steak knife.  On top of that the restaurant was half empty.  I'm sorry this place just has absolutely nothing going for it.  By the looks of the crowd, menu, food and service, this is where people and cuisine go to die."}
{"text":"Great food ... upscale experience! We were here for lunch, and I was happy to find vegetarian options on the menu. The service was good too! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with true homemade pasta and a great owner in Thomoso!  I had the pleasure of eating here last week while in Phoenix.  I had a wonderful wild mushroom Ragu with fresh fettuccini.  I also tried their salmon special, which was solid.  Just a light butter sauce, not over done.    I really had a nice experience here.  I will be back on my next visit to the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend happened to extend his layover in Phoenix overnight and we were hungry from traveling from Oakland that afternoon. We wanted something good to eat and fast food was not going to cut it.  On his first visit here he met a guy who recommended a few places to eat and this was one of them. Wow, great food.  We were under dressed and looking haggard, so we ordered takeout. We had some sides, I know broccoli was one of them for sure and bread was included with the meal. I had the best veal ravioli in a delicious, tasty sauce. Very light, with tomatoes, sage, garlic, onions and possibly veal broth and olive oil and butter. My cleaned off my plate. My bf ordered fettuccine with grilled chicken. Serving size on that was amazing, he didn't finish it all that night, and guess what I had for lunch and dinner the next day, so good even reheated. I would have loved to go again and try the beef carpaccio. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 8pm Oct 9 . There was no one at the hostess stand, waited a couple of  minutes until someone noticed us. Our server asked for our drink order and I asked for a taste of a couple wines so that we could decide which to order.  He asked two times 'so you want this one', no we we would like a taste to decide. he seemed very reluctant to follow through. We were planning to order a bottle, instead we ordered  2 glasses. We had carpaccio, nothing special.  For entrees we both had halibut and lobster ravioli.  My fish was dry, his moist. The ravioli was good but could have more lobster,  only a couple pieces the rest was filler.   Kept looking for our server abd didn't see him. Finally someone noticed that we were trying to get their attention. He said that the original server had left.  Would have been nice to know. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the authenticity of the menu and service.  Our server made some amazing recommendations from the stuffed squash blossoms to the cream puffs for dessert.  I had the Osso Buco di Maialino and it was great. I didn't even need a knife because it was melting off the bone.  My partner had the seafood pasta special and it was a bit disappointing. The lobster was overcooked and so was the majority of other shellfish on the plate. The sauce was really good but the other stuff was just meh.  I would definitely love to try it out again. The spaghetti with meatballs looked awesome."}
{"text":"Came last night for the first time. Beware that parking at tomaso's can be a bit tough with tarbell's sharing the same lot. It wasn't bad with valet, just had to wait in a line 10 minutes.   Got immediately seated and given water and our server came by a couple times so we ordered our drinks but it took a little bit of time to figure out what we wanted to eat - anyway, server sort of disappeared... First before we ordered, then our food took forever! Like it was over an hour after we came in that we finally ate what we ordered. We did get some bread though, so that helped.   Our server was weird, one girl in our party said she wasn't sure what type of wine to get and he just said ok and walked away, no help. She also was still eating bread with delicious pasta sauce and he tried to take her plate away.   The food was really good, I got the ravioli pasta combo and it tasted great, small portion but I wasn't necessarily expecting Olive Garden. And I sort of feel like if we knew what to order at the start, the food and everything would've been faster but I don't know, four stars because the service just didn't really try and it took so long and I was so hungry!"}
{"text":"We went to Tomaso's last week for a special meal for my daughter who was starting cancer treatment. They treated her like royalty and we had a delicious meal. Tomaso himself cooked her favorite pasta and gave us delicious strawberries with cannoli cream for dessert. It was an awesome experience and the entire staff went out of their way to make our dining experience memorable and fantastic."}
{"text":"Not anniversary friendly  Food was good was expecting for it to be outrageously delicious when to celebrate an anniversary for some friends when making the reservations I mentioned it was an anniversary thay never mentioned anniversary to them or brought them and anniversary cake. We did get dessert the tiramisú is freshly made every day everything else is store bought so I highly recommend the tiramisu good"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my birthday and ended up getting out of work late so we called Tomaso's to see if they could seat us because they closed at 10 and we would get there at 9:20. They politely told us to come on by. The host was so friendly and had the best sense of humor. He joked around with us but remained professional. Our server was awesome. He was friendly and didn't seem agitated that we got there later than we would have liked to. He served us in a timely manner and gave us just the right amount of space. I had the chicken parmigiana. It was the best I have ever had. Toward the end of the night they were cleaning off tables for closing but they assured us to take our time and that there was no rush. I really appreciated that. My dining buddy had to use the rest room so I waited and spoke to the bartender who recommended dishes to try the next time we came in. It was an all-around awesome experience and the staff was not only friendly and personable but they made us feel at ease even though I felt so bad about coming in close to their closing time. I would recommend them to all my friends."}
{"text":"Tomaso Maggiore, Has run Tomaso's for 35 years, since 1977,  this well know (voted best Italian Phoenix yearly) restaurant on the Camelback corridor has the goods.  You can find great Tuscan or Sicilian wines. The food is fantastic. During our meal this evening with a AZ Restaurant week pri fix menu we had the Burrata & Dates as well as the Pasta Pillows drown in a sage butter sauce. For the Entrée we had the Sweet potato gnocchi and stuffed veal. Dessert we had the tiramisu and chocolate crunch cake. The food was perfectly cooked. Often gnocchi can be over cooked, gluten chewy. Ours was perfect.  The veal was stuffed with cheese, accompanied with a mushroom demi glaze which was so awesome.  All was delicious! Our bottle of wine with dinner was the Super Sicilian Luxus 5. Tomaso, On one of his many trips to Sicily, he met by chance Giovanni Maggio, who shared the same dream. In 1994 in Agrigento Sicily, a vineyard of 150 acres was born featuring wines with the bold, natural flavors of the land, and a complexity that ensured its success. Maggiore's Luxus 5 Meritage is a blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Nero D'avola, 13% Merlot, 5% Petit Verdot and 7% Syrah.  A dry, medium intensity. The flavors are quite complex and include red cherries, red plums, vanilla, black pepper, clove and liquorice. The service was great, it pays to have employees with longevity who are dedicated to the task. Here are some facts from Tomaso's web site that makes you appreciate him even more: Tomaso's opened its doors on September 10, 1977 at 3:59PM Tomaso's has served over 10 million locals & visitors over the past 35 years Hundreds of thousands of Arizona residents have celebrated their birthdays, anniversaries, first dates and even weddings at Tomaso's. Tomaso's has supported 100s of local non-profits, schools and charities. Year after year, Tomaso's has been voted the Best Italian Restaurant in Arizona. Over the past 35 years, Tomaso's has provided employment for 1000s of Arizonans.  Many of our past team members have gone on to become successful  restauranteurs, lawyers, doctors, business and community leaders. At Tomaso's, the best is yet to come!"}
{"text":"From the service to the atmosphere to the food, this restaurant will make you feel like you are eating at a small cafe in Italy.  Just an overall amazing experience.  Food = 5* Atmosphere = 5* Service = 5*"}
{"text":"Went on Wednesday place is nice service was good but didn't feel like we got good value for what we paid.  Can't give 3.5 stars definitely not 4 so have to give 3.  Will try again and when I'm off lent.  I had a seafood pasta dish the server recommended."}
{"text":"Started out with the bread which was very good. The calamari was good for our appetizer. Main course was chicken parm and seafood / pasta dish. Food was good and service was not good, not near enough staff for the amount of tables, our waiter was very busy the entire time doing his best. This is where I have a value problem, I don't mind the big ticket, but I had better get the whole package and Tomaso's disappointed us."}
{"text":"A rehearsal dinner I went to was hosted here this past weekend - I have to say overall I was impressed with the place. Italian food in the middle of the desert seemed like a questionable choice to me, but I remained with an open mind, open and mostly dehydrated...  The party of 30(+/-?) arrived with a fairly good clip, there were a few stragglers, and a few people who were there before the main group of us. We were all graciously welcomed and directed to the back/function room.   The waiters were (THANKFULLY) quick to replenish all of our water glasses as soon as we emptied them, and since we are from a way different climate, we went through a TON of water even before everybody else had arrived.   I had forgotten to mention in my rsvp that I had a nut allergy, and when I looked at the place setting and noted the included menu had an almond dessert the waiter was very good to work with me and get me something that I could eat - three flavors of gelato, very tasty.   The pasta dish was fusilli carbonara, which is one of my favorite dishes (to make at home, and to order) and they did pretty well with it, I have to say, I've seen some places mess it up royally, but this had a good balance and when I got some extra grated cheese from our waiter, it gave it a little bit more of a \"bite\" or \"kick\" that it was looking for to really fill out the flavor. If it had been homemade fusilli, Tomaso would have won my heart!  There was some confusion or miscommunication between the waiters, us about wither or not wine was *part* of the meal, or if it was by the glass, and added to a tab for our table. Regardless, it was good wine, and I'm glad I had it for my meal, it was a small price (confusion, and in dollars) to have a nice glass of wine to compliment my chicken, and everybody else's steak.   The service was excellent, they catered to our every need, and assisted even the more bizarre requests. The one thing that could make this private function room THAT much more functional, in my mind is a bathroom that is closer than the polar opposite side of the restaurant.   If I ever find myself back in this part of the world, I'll try to make it back and try some of their other dishes - and hopefully be better prepared for the heat!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant was pleasant, and fairly decent by Arizona standards. The Pasta was properly cooked and the portions of meat and pasta were average. I've had far worse in this state. We ate here in 2014.   I've eaten at a number of Italian restaurants in the Phoenix Metro area, but have decided not to anymore. I grew up in the New York/New Jersey Metro area, and the quality of Italian restaurants in that part of the country, whether a famous  place or a ma and pa hole in the wall, is absolutely outstanding. Arizona has quite a number of Italian eateries that impress people here, but to me, given where I grew up, it's just a disappointment. I love Arizona for a vast number of reasons, but Italian food is not one of them.   I suppose this statement may anger some people in Scottsdale, the West's most Eastern town, but it stands. I have had outstanding Italian food in the Phoenix metro area, but home cooked in people's homes, none of them chefs, and not all of them Italian."}
{"text":"Last night had dinner at Tomaso's.  Waiter was quite good, the braised short rib adequate-overly salty the accompanying gnochi very tasty, but the off menu special of butterflied shrimp and risotto with logostinos  was superb.  The MAJOR disappoint was the drinks.  I ordered vodka on the rocks with onions. I have had stronger water.  The vodka was clearly watered down.  In fact the only taste came from the 3 onions.  AND it was expensive.  Went to Tomaso's after seeing the chef on a local tv station. The restaurant was founded in 1977.  Being in business almost 39 years indicates acceptance by the going out to eat crowd.    Today I was told Tomaso's is known for watering the alcohol depending upon the owner's then mood.  Order wine can't water it down.  Go for the food not the bar you should be ok."}
{"text":"Didn't expect much here upon arrival to the strip mall it is located in but was pleasantly surprised.   Decided to go for Italian food rather than go to the trendy Tarbell's  located in the same strip mall. As opposed to other reviewers,  I simple just parked in the half empty lot in front of the place, no problems.  Valet was available but not required.  The place was empty but the reception was friendly and the service was good to excellent.  Friendly Italian waiter told me it was the slowest week of the year traditionally here.   The wine list was more than adequate but the Italian selections were pricey, I found some better deals on the US selections.   The food was also good to excellent with excellent pastas and fish available, I had the cioppino (I know cioppino and this was 4 star). Salad and vegetable sides were done very well. It is a little old school, kind of reminded me of a suburban Italian Durant's."}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite Italian restaurant in the valley.  Been here well over 50 times and I can honestly say the food is always outstanding and the service is unmatched. They will accommodate any dish you ask for without the slight hesitation. I enjoy my conversations with Tomaso when I visit.  Superb!"}
{"text":"This is a staple of anyone who appreciates the culinary offerings in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Open since 1977, this fine establishment exudes class, quality, and more than anything else, exceptional, heart-warming Italian food.   Enjoy a bottle of wine or two on a romantic date night, casual dinner with friends, or a sturdy drink when you post up at the bar.   The food is phenomenal and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Truly a must on any foodie's list of restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"I went there for a friends Bday and it did not disappoint.  Our waiter lived in Italy for 10 years and was a great server.  The pasta is very good and the drinks are strong, I recommend both."}
{"text":"I had a very enjoyable working lunch here yesterday.  I've dined here a few times before for dinner and experienced very good food and excellent service, and this first time lunch experience was no different.  We arrived to a very quiet dining room at 1pm, and were greeted with a welcoming, efficient air by the sole server.  Chairs pulled out, napkins placed on laps, ice cold filtered water served immediately with a plate of lemons without asking.  The bread was crusty, fresh, and served with some sort of delicious compound butter full of galic and herbs. I opted for a chicken caesar, which was served in a handmade parmesan-cheese basket.  They dressed up the chicken breast with a nice light crust of herbs and bread crumbs, and presented the juicy slices over a bed of crisp romaine (which had been dried thoroughly prior to being dressed-- I HATE wet salad leaves!).  The dressing could have had a bit more bite to it , like a good blast of fresh anchovies, but overall a caesar I would order again. The other guests in our party all opted for the rolled ricotta and eggplant special, which was accompanied by large butternut squash ravioli in a light creamy sauce.  Although I didn't try this dish, the crowd cheered and cleaned their plates. The food is quite good, but what really stands out in my mind is the excellent, but not overbearing, service.  Next time I go I will be sure to get this server's name so I may give him proper kudos!"}
{"text":"Dingy dining room poor rushed sevrice. Lobster bisque not fresh at all. Chopped salad was all wilted as if it had been plated hours ago and then dressed. All the veggies were wilted. Chicken dish was rubbery served with overcooked broccoli and 2 dull potato wedges. Quite pricey at $24 for a 6-7 ounce  chix breast. Even the bread was subpar It was  torn pieces of ital bread not terribly fresh. Being used to superior italian food in NYC and LA, this place will never see me again"}
{"text":"Lovely dinner! We all had some variation of seafood that was heavenly. We were in the back room which was nice and we could converse without screaming. Service was a tad slow but it was Saturday nite and very busy. The food was the star with two of us having the halibut,scallop, and risotto special. Nero d'Avola wine was good accompaniment. Finished with the chocolate mousse and cannoli. A Phoenix classic!"}
{"text":"Tomaso's is classic (northern) Italian in an old country setting, straight up. I was concerned after hanging around Little Italy for a month that Arizona's fare would not measure up. I was wrong.  Granted, we did not have the standard experience as we came on Christmas Eve, but the staff was friendly and warm. As we watched food being served, it seemed the same dishes kept coming up over and over again, which is good since our rookie order overlapped:  - Tuscan Legume Soup ($8): Enjoyable but otherwise unremarkable. - Mozzarella Caprese ($13): Sized for two and executed excellently. - Fish Roulade ($29): Special of the evening was fish rolled with crab and lobster meat over spinach with lobster ravioli. How can one go wrong? One can't. - Scampi Caprese & Lobster Ravioli ($28): I'd call this a miss but I'm in the minority as my parents both enjoyed it and most of the restaurant seemed to agree. - The Best Lasagna Ever ($24): A bold claim, but this really was the best lasagna I've had in a very long time - balanced flavors and not too heavy.  For dessert, an adequate tiramisu was heavily overshadowed in both size and preference by a monster cannoli.   Tomaso's is a little on the expensive side but one is clearly paying for quality of atmosphere, service and food. It meets the difficult bar of somewhere on which both my meat and potatoes parents and I can agree. For a special occasion (or on an expense account) I'd definitely drop in again."}
{"text":"Good but not mind blowing good!  Our waiter was very attentive. Always checked on us and made good recommendations. Service = 5 stars!  As for the food, it was a mixed feeling for us. It was good and decent. The complimentary bread and herb butter was delicious. We had also ordered the lobster bisque as well. Good but my bf wasn't too into it!! Calamari were cooked well but we felt the sauce could use a touch more seasoning. My dish, the Amazing Spinach blah blah blah (long name; essentially spinach pasta and braised short ribs) was okay. My pasta was not cooked evenly, some I felt was still under. I was hoping to be wowed since I've heard so much about their freshly made pasta. Maybe I went in with too high of expectation?! The price + my dish yields them 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"We came here for a business dinner. Parking was a nightmare, as the lot was very crowded and the line of cars for valet made it hard to actually maneuver around. We ended up parking in a lot around the corner, behind the restaurant, and it was a very short walk to the front entrance.   The interior is cozy, with tasteful decor. Our dinner had some preset options, including a salad, your choice of entree, and dessert. I opted for a prawn dish. The presentation was well done, the prawns were excellently cooked, with a very delicate flavor.   Service was very attentive and drinks were refilled as needed.   Despite the parking hassle, this is a great place for a nice night out and I'll definitely be coming back if I'm in the mood for upscale Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"Hands down best Italian food in Phoenix/Scottsdale! Authentic, great quality food. The service is top notch. Many of the wait staff are Italian and have an accent which is nice because it gives the feeling of a truly authentic experience. The gnocchi is unbelievable as well as the veal and chicken. I've never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"First visit here with an Open Table reso for 5:15 PM on the Friday of Valentines weekend (Had ballet tickets for 7:30). We were disappointed with the choice made by the hostess to seat us at the last two top by the rear door. Worst table in the resto. We were entertained by the staff hanging in the service alcove by our table grumbling lol. Our waiter was clearly not their best. We observed other waiters who were polished pro's and wished we were enjoying their service. Cocktails were generous, wines by the glass, so so.  The Capresi appetizer is terrific with Heirloom Tomatoes that were very tasty. I had the veal chop saltimboca and it was terrific, if too much food. My partner had the lobster and seafood pasta and it was very very good. All in all I would say there are other choices that I would make before a return visit, and if I return I will insist on a central table and a better waiter."}
{"text":"NEW location on Scottsdale road is OUTSTANDING and welcomed addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Three of us went there for a celebration.  They did not have the mouth watering filet mignon on the menu but they were willing to give us anything we wanted.  So I ordered a medley to different things so I could try out different menu items.  The salad was very good with the pistachos.  The bread and butter was even a wow factor.  The place was very nicely lit and amazing wait staff.  Geno waited on us amazing they way he spoke to us, he treated us like royalty.  The tables had white linen cloths on them, very upscale establishment and not at all noisy you were able to have a conversation without yelling.  We ordered the wild caught pistachio salmon which was very good, the seafood pasta with sea bass amazing and the trio of fist size raviolli's  The butternut squash homemade raviolli was amazing.  Very nice atmosphere, great wait staff, nice ambience everything you would want in a upscale restaurant.  Plus the melt in your mouth Filet is always an added advantage!!! Yum Yum Good!!!!"}
{"text":"I think there's something to be said about going to a restaurant twice during our visit to Az. The food is amazing. The ossobucco is succulent and delicious. The cioppino was crazy wonderful. The staff is super friendly and my hubs loved the wine list. Tomaso's provide a wonderful dining experience. Believe me, the quality and taste of their food is something I won't forget."}
{"text":"70$ for the two off us that included eggplant and gnocci that tasted like the olive garden.  My wife said her meal was good, but I was seriously disappointed.  If I'm paying 25$ for a plate of pasta, you better give me food orgasms.  Well, olive garden tasting food was far from it, plus the parking situation is a joke."}
{"text":"I love Italian food! This [fancy] place deserves a good review for food and wine and ambiance. I can't argue! I was here for a company's dinner, the wines were excellent. Food was good but not \"wow\". Perhaps, it's not fair since I didn't pay for dinner. I would like to try this out on a more casual date...and freely rating this place. One thing was cool that the owner had his own wine labeled. Some free sample...then a bottle later between three of us - it was good! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  Being that our visit was on V-day the menu was a special holiday menu and the items I had read about on Yelp were not all included.  We were walked through the entire restaurant into their sister restaurant. We were told there were so many reservations they had to open up the other restaurant. They sat our party of 4 at a small hi top bar table. They said that's all they had.  During our entire meal they kept trying to sit people at these hi tops and people kept complaining.    Our service was good and the food was good.  We had the linguini seafood which was good, but lacked that flavor.  Another person had the filet ravioli. It tasted like a meat sauce on top of the ravioli, but was good. The two others had the eggplant. My wife liked it and thought it was delicious.    Overall I would say good food, but I would probably not make a trip from Gilbert again."}
{"text":"Dined at Tomaso's with a group of 12 last Friday evening while enjoying the Labor Day weekend at the Bilmore. We chose Tomaso's due the the Yelp reviews and proximity to the hotel.  Although our waiter was not Italian (I believe he was South American), he was pretty good.  I think he tried to give our large group time to chat so it was nice not to be rushed (which seemed very European).  The meals served were beautiful, but I don't think any of us thought the food was that amazing (we also ate at the Capital Grille and Frank & Albert's-see those reviews-and really enjoyed the food).  I thought the restaurant had priced its menu well for the ambiance and plates served.  I would not be opposed to returning, but there are other better options in the area."}
{"text":"Dined here on Friday June 9th. Had made reservations, but no need as the restaurant wasn't busy. Many empty tables! A shame!  Started with drinks & ordered the Friend Calamari. They also offered a special which was an artichoke w/ zucchini flower. We ordered that as well but unfortunately they were out of artichokes. Ended up getting that special minus the choke with a few extra zucchini flowers. Those zucchini flowers were amazing, stuffed with mozzarella cheese & deep fried. Calamari was standard.  Caesar salad nice presentation, served in a Parmesan cheese bowl, no croutons. Again, standard in taste! I had the ravioli trio: which was an evening special. Three different samples of three types of raviolis. A tortellini in a butter sauce, a mushroom truffle w/ truffle oil , & a pear pecorino. This pear pecorino was heavenly! My husband has the seafood pasta with squid ink pasta. He seemed to like his meal- However, he sampled mine & would have preferred that! Our colleague had the lobster bisque soup which he enjoyed and the Paccheri Amalfitani.  A downside to the experience. The wait staff wanted to CLEAR our table constantly! We were relaxing, enjoying conversation with our business associate during all the stages of our meals. We were interrupted often by the many bussers that where either trying to grab our plates we hadn't finished, taking plates without asking or asking if we were finished when we clearly weren't?! Our butter was swiped off the table before we even got to taste the complementary bread, had to ask for another.To many employees on staff for how unoccupied the room was. Our waiter was fine; with that said, paying for the atmosphere & fancy flare is another. In our observation  it's extremely pricey for the portions & was not as memorable as we would have wished for."}
{"text":"i was having a thoroughly unimpressive trip to phoenix.  actually my 1st trip to phoenix ever and was starting to feel extremely disillusioned.  i had always heard great things about how fun phoenix was but i guess i must not have been listening very carefully b/c on the way there and while there everyone i spoke to had unkind things to say about the dinning and nightlife.  (turns out tempe and scottsdale are the place to be.)  anyway - excuse my rant. the point is that tomaso's was my one gleaming ray of hope for a decent meal.  i found it on yelp and based on user reviews (w/ the help of gps) i trekked across th 10 E and wah-la! there it was in a nevada bob's strip mall. - ok not impressive but when i strolled in at the off-peak the bartender (Dave) greeted me and promptly set me up at the bar. he doubles as the sommelier and was really helpful in picking out a perfect glass of wine.  the food (linguine w/ clams) was good but not stellar. the linguine was a bit over cooked but it was still better than anything else i'd come across.  the most impressive thing here is how friendly the staff and the patrons were.  it's clear that tomaso (the man, the myth, the legend) has cultivated a good following of locals that come back again and again.  i was surprised to find that he also owns three restaurants in california, a winery and i believe another restaurant in the phoenix area. - you would never know it was such a big operation b/c it still feels small and authentic."}
{"text":"Besides being over-priced, the food wasn't good.  Meal was lukewarm and lacked taste.  Service was good, hence the 2 stars instead of 1.    We won't be back."}
{"text":"Our family dined at Tomaso's last night, Christmas Day. We have dined there and their fabulous restaurant next door, Tommy V's for years and years. We did not have a good experience last night. The four of us were placed at a table for 2. We waited 10-15 minutes before anyone came to offer us water, drinks, bread or a menu. Our waiter was rude. He barely had time to talk about the menu or offer his suggestions. We had to ask for bread and additional drinks. The wrong soup was delivered. When the second bowl arrived it was cold. Our entrees were not hot and the fish did not smell fresh.When our entrees were served, we had to ask if they could remove the 1st course plates. When we finally had to ask for the bill, the waiter shook his head in disgust.  We heard that this was the first year Tomaso's was open on Christmas day. I don't think they were prepared for the volume of business, but I would think the number of reservations would be an indication. They have been in business long enough to know. The owner was hanging in the lobby the entire evening and never looked around at the tables to see if anything was needed. Needless to say, it was NOT a good experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner five fish dinner on black and red pasta outrageously good. Service was excellent food was great   House chianti was great."}
{"text":"This is a classic Italian restaurant landmark in Phoenix.  The atmosphere on the entire experience is romantic... just the way an Italian restaurant should be.   The service was exceptional and I deeply wanted to give this place five stars.   However, there was a blimpish on my last visit and I just can't get over it.  So, I ordered salmon in an Italian restaurant... and I should have ordered pasta or something traditional.   The dish was called Lobster crusted salmon and should have been called salmon with blobs of lobster sauce...  there was nothing crusted about the dish and seemed to be a bust for $32.   Anyway, I'll get over it and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service, Giovanni was our waiter and was phenomenally well versed in the menu and its various options.    The only complaint that my party and I had was the Valet was a little rude and vague about parking, It's definitely easier if you enter the lot from N 32nd St. rather than East Camelback to avoid the loop around the lot to the valet personnel."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. The chef gave a personal tutorial class to my wife and her friends on my wife's birthday. They made her birthday party extra special. The service was phenomenal and everyone at the restaurant went the extra mile to make the food and the service unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Tomaso's location in North Scottsdale tonight and the service was so bad I walked out . After 20 minutes nobody asked us if we wanted a drink or anything. There were only four tables occupied in the entire restaurant and nobody would wait on us .  Absolutely the worst customer service I have experienced in a restaurant. There are too many good restaurants in North Scottsdale to waste your time on Tomaso's ."}
{"text":"We were here last night and I had the \"fresh petrale sole and lobster ravioli.\"  The lobster ravioli was good but the \"pan-seared, parmesan-crusted, lemon and butter\" petrale sole was overpowered by lemon. I was able to find part of the fish without the \"lemon and butter\" but it tasted bland and watering. This pricy dish was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Tomaso's is a good, down home, northern italian. They make their own pastas fresh daily, and you can never go wrong there. A friend of mine ordered a steak there once, and claimed it to be the dryest piece of meat they had ever eaten. Meanwhile, I was working on my $28 kobe ravioli, which consisted of 4, count them 4 raviolis... yeah, definitely not gonna cut it. The service is ok, but there are issues now and then with small irrelevent things. They have a very old clientele from the area that I just get the feeling have been frequenting the restaurant for a very long time, and wont dare change what they order. That being said, they don't want anything to change from the menu to the ambiance, to the staff that works there. The whole staff is Italian, and they know how to cook pretty well, but I can't shake that feeling that I'm about 40 years too young to be there, and the portions are just way too small.  +1 for great wine list +1 for homemade pasta -1 for the old people atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Italian food that's not homemade, but I must say I love the food here. Seafood is always excellent! Also, my family hosted my grad school graduation dinner here for a party of 12 and the service was out of this world!!! They took such good care of us that I will always have fond memories of that night!!! It's not cheap, but the quality is well worth it. Parking is limited, but valet is complimentary."}
{"text":"I cant express my frustration enough. I was so excited to eat fine Italian food but now I'll never try it. As soon as our group walked in we were greeted with dirty looks from the manager and older servers. Yes, we were the youngest people in the entire restaurant. I've never been so clearly judged and belittled. We get seated and wait 20 minutes before deciding to leave after watching tables who arrived after us be greeted by a waiter, presented with a wine list and already had orders taken. Do NOT eat here if you are younger than 50 because the entire service staff will assume you don't have enough money to dine there. We came in there with intentions to spend but apparently our 20 something selves were not welcome. As we left, even the server in our section did not bother to ask what was wrong, he just said have a good night. Well, I hope Tomaso's continues to thrive off the retirement community."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. My husband and I both work in the service industry and were super excited to FINALLY be able to spend Valentines Day together ON Valentine's Day, instead of having to work. I've told my husband numerous times about how Tomaso's butter squash ravioli brought tears to my eyes because it was sooooo amazing! I haven't been here in several years, so when he surprised me with dinner here for Valentines Day, I was so excited! The issues started when we were seated. We were greeted with water and bread in a timely manner, but everything else seemed to take FOREVER. We sat with the wine menu closed for a good 20 minutes before our server finally came to take our drink order. He walked by us several times in these 20 minutes, so we started to think that either he forgot we were his table, or he assumed we did not have the money to dine here because of our age (mid 20's and early 30's), therefore he simply didn't care to give us good service.  We ordered a couple glasses of wine, the calamari appetizer, the chicken parmigiana, and the nights special, cioppino (which I had to ask our server about because nobody informed us about specials, yet every table around us was ordering it). The calamari was bland and soggy. My husband ordered the chicken parm and was confused when it came out with broccoli and potatoes, when the menu specifically said it came with rigatoni (I even checked the menu on our way out). The sides were lukewarm and he found a hair in his food! I ordered the cioppino and it was boring to say the least. The shrimp were sandy and the mussels had a very STRONG fishy taste, which turned me off to the dish completely. Why didn't we send our food back? Because our server was nowhere to be found during our ENTIRE meal. Not once did he touch the table other than to take our order and bring the check. This was supposed to be a special night for us and was a total letdown. For $130 we expect decent service (at the least) and hot, fresh, hairless food. It's safe to say we will never come here again."}
{"text":"Waited two hours for our meal...no literally two hours. After an hour and 15 minutes, they decided to so generously comp us two drinks, which is exactly what a person needs after starving for two hours, more alcohol. The waiter was very nice and polite and not his fault. After two hours of waiting, we decided to walk out and he chased us out saying he has our food in hand. The restaurant management was aware of the situation and offered me a \"glass of wine on the house\"...I don't even drink wine and the whole situation was totally absurd. I've been to restaurants where the simplest mistake was made and I got comped an appetizer, drinks AND dessert. These guys did NOTHING right and comped us drinks which we didn't even consume bc we were starving. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in a city with great restaurants, Tomaso's is both a classic in the area and has an ever-changing menu.  Service is exemplary, attentive without being intrusive. Meals are paced well, and whether I have an hour-long dinner or a three-hour dinner, it never feels rushed.  Menu items change regularly, though cult favorites - spaghetti and meatballs, for one, and the sole - are almost always available. A particular joy is the fresh-daily ravioli, which is tremendously wonderful each time.  Off-menu items, both specials and requests, are often available. Our waiter summed it up one time by saying \"If we have the parts, we'll make the dish.\" We've put that to the test a few times, and they always deliver.  A really good wine list, particularly rich in Barolo.  Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends for restaurant week. The salmon bruschetta and caprese were very good. But the Sole Picatta was delicious. My friend order lasagna which was made with a bechemel sauce and was very tasty. The lamb osso bucco was fall off the bone yummy"}
{"text":"This place has great food!  This place is a staple for a working lunch but I don't know why more people don't come here at night.   I was there mid week around 8 and the place was almost empty. Two friends and I ate at the bar because it was a little too quiet in the dining room. I've been coming here for 10-15 years and the bartenders are always great.   Martinis to start. Big honest.  Caesar. Parmesan bowl. Killer croutons. Anchovies on request. Awesome.   The bartender recommended the lasagna with a side of homemade sausage. Un fn believable! So so so good. Cheesy. Lots of meat sauce. Home made pasta.   I've had almost every main dish and have never been disappointed. The pasta dishes are perfectly al dente and the chicken veal dishes are perfectly cooked with excellent sauces. The service is old school and always excellent.   The decor is a little dated but that's the only negative."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for Arizona restaurant week. We had a very good dinner. I ordered the stuffed squash blossoms, the roulade of veal and for desert i got the chocolate caramel crunch. The wife got the roasted beet salad, the filet and the tiramisu.   Everything about my meal was very good. Was very surprised at how good the veal was. The desert was a little rich but none the less still delicious.  My wife enjoyed hers as well but neither of us was impressed with the filet, it just didn't seem very tender. But her tiramisu was delicious.  This was our 2nd time eating here and both times have been good experiences."}
{"text":"The food and services were exceptional, fantastic wine list. The large dining room in the back could have better ambience ( i.e. dim the bright lights!) but that is the only small improvement. A great evening and the food could not have been better."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here again for a date night surprise. Delicioso! Fresh made pasta and exquisite in taste. He had the filet ravioli and I had the pasta platter with a variety of three different raviolis. Everything was cooked to perfection and service was on point with a smile. I can't wait to come back here again and devour their tasty, creamy, flavorful dishes. Yes.. It's on the pricey side.. But worth every bite. We left with our bellies full and happy. Thank you Tomasos for being an Italian staple to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Saturday night I had the pleasure to dine at Tomaso's with some friends. I hadn't been there in years as we live in Chandler and don't often venture that far. It was worth the drive. The restaurant reminds me of old Hollywood- kind of glamorous and classy. The waiters are dressed in crisp white shirts with ties. Our waiter was very Italian and very gracious. Nicely set tables, great ambiance, and great art on the walls. We ordered several different things and please forgive my spelling of some of these dishes. If you look at their menu you'll be able to figure it out. I had the lobster bisque, 2 had the minestrone soup and one had a beautiful salad- all were excellent. The Asso bucco (sp?), eggplant Parmesan and lasagne were all first rate. I had a noodle dish with prosciutto that was fabulous. We had tiramisu and a nonna cake thing that were amazing- especially the tiramisu. A little spendy- probably someplace for celebrations- but great value, service and food."}
{"text":"My wife and went here for our first time on her Birthday and we were not let down. This place had great food, some of the best we have had in  a long time. If you enjoy great food this is the place to go, we will be returning."}
{"text":"Had heard good things about Tomaso's and finally hosted dinner there for out-of-town business clients. Was very impressed when I walked in. The decor was quietly distinguished and gave a warm upscale impression.  Two of us each ordered the Osso Bucco that had been removed from the bone. It was very blah and the pasta it was on was overdone and stuck together like one big clump of dough. How does an Italian restaurant not know how to make good al dente pasta?  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant I have visited since moving to the valley. The last visit was on 9/17/2017 at 5PM. Our welcoming server, Erin Patrick, made our party of 5 feel like family. Explained with precise detail how plates were prepared and even offered to modify any selection to our taste. I nearly slipped off my comfortable chair when he stated \"if any of you have a favorite Italian dish and you don't see it on the menu just tell me and I will make it for you.\" All 5 of us had different menu options with each of us so in love with our meal choice we were passing spoonfuls of our meal to another saying \"try this-it is so good.\" May be a bit pricey for pasta meals, however you will not feel taken, but blessed to feel special by being in an old world Italian home for a Sunday family meal at grandma's table. I will be driving from Surprise across the valley to dine here again. Great place for a romantic meal with your special friend where quiet conversation, hand holding, and staring at each other's eyes seem very much appropriate."}
{"text":"Food is good... Service can be slow.  We sat down and it was at least 10-15 minutes before the waiter came over.  Then, we ordered an appetizer (mozzarella tasting board - very good).  After we finished the app, the dirty plates were not taken away despite people coming by or passing the table repeatedly until our dinner showed up.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Could give zero stars if I could. From the second I walked in there no one acknowledged me and when someone finally did he was extremely rude and dismissing like if i wasn't good enough to be there because I'm Hispanic and everyone in there was white but me. I ordered for pick up and my food was sloppy and disgusting. SO RUDE they should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"This place doesn't live up to its reputation. Food was so so at best. Service was ok but I didn't need the waiters life story. I've heard about it for years , looked forward to going and can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"I was there for a group dinner. I thought it was really strange that they didn't have take-out boxes and we couldn't order a soda. They also didn't ask me how I wanted my steak cooked.  The seafood dinner looked good and the bread was great.  The desserts were a little lackluster, but I think this would be a great place to go for a date night with the husband. But you should be prepared to pay a steep price."}
{"text":"I have never left a review and got this app just to leave one today - this place is TERRIBLE!!! We went there last night for a special night's dinner; my husband had the Alaskan Halibut with Lobster Ravioli and I had the Alaskan Halibut with Blue Crab over Squid Ink Pasta: the halibut was over cooked and dry for both dishes, the blue crab tasted like it was from a can, and the sauce for my dish tasted like it was from a jar. The squid ink pasta was under cooked, less than al dente. They served regular tap water. The server was distracted, inattentive, and never checked to see how we enjoyed the meal. The temperature of the restaurant was too low, myself and other guests were freezing.  Two things that were good: the lobster ravioli were excellent and the manager tried to adjust the temperature. Needless to say, we were more than a little disappointed! We expected more from a restaurant that charges these kinds of prices! Keep your money, go somewhere else, this place isn't worth it!!  We probably should have tried Tarbells in the same strip mall."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! My wife visits a shop just south of them and gets holes drilled in her head there, so we always go to eat at my fav Italian joint after her sessions!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the fact that even the waiter speaks Italian.  cant be as authentic as that."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my boyfriend out to a nice Italian restaurant for his birthday rather than doing a steakhouse. I got a recommendation from a coworker to try Tomaso's and I was excited to try a new Italian restaurant that wasn't Olive Garden.  The parking lot was small and we had no choice but to do the complimentary valet.  I'm not a big fan of valeting my car because I've had things stolen from my car before and then I feel obligated to tip.  The atmosphere inside is really nice and cozy and has a romantic feel to it.  The menu items sounded amazing but I was actually pretty disappointed when we got our meal.  Before going out to dinner, I had scoped out the menu online and decided on what I wanted to eat which was the \"scampi and risotto\".  The description of this dish was \"Grilled Giant Prawns with Garlic Scented EVOO; Served with Seafood Medley Risotto\" and I was expecting giant prawns and what I got were 4 little prawns with risotto that wasn't cooked all the way and the rice was hard and dry.  I was really disappointed and I really wanted to like the food but it just wasn't what I expected at all, especially for a high priced dish.  The bread and butter they give you before your meal was delicious.  The bread was warm and fresh and the butter was good.  My boyfriend ordered Sea Scallops, Blue Lump Crab, Scampi & Nero di Seppia all'Arrabbiata and he said it was ok but the sauce seemed bland but the seafood seemed to be a generous amount.  The service I will say was exceptional.  They filled our waters and was very attentive.  When I made the reservations to the restaurant, I noted that it was my boyfriends birthday and during dinner, the owner came by and wished him a happy birthday.  When we finished our meal, without even asking the server, the manager and three other servers came with a piece of cake and lit candle and sang him happy birthday.  It was great to see that their service was on point but as far as their food, it's nothing to rave about. I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Very very pricey.  Food was ok. But portions are small. The chicken parmigian was ok, but ridiculously small for $30.  Doesn't even come with pasta. Who serves chicken Park with vegetables. Not sure how you get away with charging those prices but I guess their model is to get them to come once/pay once and not get many returning customers."}
{"text":"We showed up on Dec 30 after hearing so much about this place. Should have gone somewhere else. Ordered the lasagna and stuffed veal chop. Both items were lacking in taste and the veal was flabby. The manager, a very pleasant and professional young lady, immediately came over and offering other items. My wife ordered the salmon and I got the antipasto starter as my meal. Bottom line, will never go back nor do I recommend this restaurant."}
