{"text":"We were here tonight, it's our second visit in 3 weeks.  This is a little counter ordering pizza joint.  We had an order of chicken wings (Med), meatball parmesan sub, and antipasto sandwich, and 2 diet cokes.  In this joint, you order then go sit down.  You food and drinks are brought to the table, and they come back often to check on you and refill sodas.  $27 total ($4 tip included).

The music is background,  staff is fabulous, and the place is clean overall.  First the wings.  I should say I'm from Buffalo.  THEY ARE GOOD!!!!  They came with some kind of ranch, and they should have come with Blue Cheese... but I didn't ask for it.  They were so good, I didn't need any. The salad had romaine lettuce that was fresher than the grocery store!  The meatball sub was simply perfect.  Great size (10\"), very meaty, the perfect amount of sauce, and toasted nicely.  

Very good food, good portions, good value, great place!  My wife is traveling the next 2 weeks... me thinks I'll be at Redendo's the next 2 Fridays!!!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place one star because you cannot pick zero. I ordered a sausage pizza and it tasted like cardboard. I know there are so many reviews that \"claim\" this place makes great pizza but I honestly believe that the people who make these claims either work there or have zero taste buds. It was so bad that I wanted to bring the pizza back and get a refund! The sauce had no taste, there was barely any sausage, and the crust was plentiful hence the cardboard taste. If a basic sausage pizza was tasteless think about how disappointing their specialty pizza must be."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate redendos higher then a 5 star rating, excellent food, extremely courteous staff and well kept establishment"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place was great. Staff was attentive and friendly! Unfortunately, the food is sub par. Had the spaghetti with meat sauce. It was just a can of tomatoe sauce. No flavor. There meat ball would be great minus the sauce."}
{"text":"I can't remember the name of the spinach pizza but it was wonderful.  Great food and a great person in the community"}
{"text":"We live in FH and I'm from NY so... this is a natural for us.  The crust is right, the sauce is right.  You can do it up for dinner or grab a slice at the counter, just like any good joint back in New York.
My wife and I like to share the enormous Antipasti salad and then we each get a slice or two.  That's alot of food and everything tastes great.  Very consistent."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for pizza, pasta and salad! They say you can judge a good Italian restaurant by its sauce and it's house dressing. If that's true, then this place rocks! My favorite is the cheese pizza, antipasto salad and the sausage appetizer. Their spaghetti with meat sauce is also out of this world...enough for two people. I can't believe I am lucky enough to have this wonderful place in my own backyard! I just wish they would bring their Cobb Salad back, it was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Never even got a chance to order. Called in, put on hold. When gal came back on line, I ordered from their online menu. The menu had not been updated in awhile and I only know this as I tried to clarify the item & price ordered and was rudely interrupted before being placed on hold again. Line picked up, went on hold, picked up and then was hung up on. Felt as though I was really ruining her evening...not a great experience as a customer who wants to spend money somewhere. Too bad, I've had their food before and it was decent, but will not spend another dime there since they can't afford good help."}
{"text":"Meh, not the \"best\" by far concerning the pizza. Like the fresh tomatoes but lacking in flavor from the other toppings. Maybe it's cause the crust is too heavy. There are better options especially in scottsdale."}
{"text":"I see this place every time I drive past work so I decided to try it with my boyfriend after church. We ordered an appetizer of garlic knots, I ordered a slice of cheese pizza, and he got Tony R's favorite calzone. The garlic knots were warm and fluffy, definitely homemade and delicious. They brought out the pizza and calzone at the same time after we ate the garlic knots and they were better than expectations! The calzone was loaded and it was perfectly golden. The pizza had a perfect cheese and sauce ratio and was the perfect temperature. They have cute memorabilia and a small but comfy eating area. Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants pizza and definitely coming again, maybe even for take out on a lazy date night."}
{"text":"Terrific place for those whom can appreciate old school Pizza. I almost felt like I was back in Brooklyn visiting my brother in law. And if you are a tiramisu aficionado as I am, don't miss theirs. All that said, if your idea of a great pizza experience is one of the heavily advertised national chains, you might be a hater. Hone your palate, and try it again."}
{"text":"Yuck, just yuck.  When I walked in and the first thing I smelled was a dirty mophead I should have turned around and walked out.  The mop was on the floor next to the register and the horrible smell of that dirty mophead by the register was VERY strong.   (I've worked in food places and know that smell and it means someone isn't really keeping things clean.)  The floor in view behind the register was dirty looking and the looked like it needs a good scrubbing.  I picked up an order to go and couldn't even eat half of the order, and my wife had the same issues with her's.  The chicken dish was very tough and chewy and the pasta was very dry.  The eggplant was greasy and dry. The cannoli we spilt wasn't bad but it wasn't enough to make up for the meal."}
{"text":"Slice of cheese pizza with red pepper flakes and parm - delicious!  Crust was crisp around edges and just the right amount of soft in the middle.  I'm a cheese pizza purest and this fit the bill.  Great atmosphere, too - very casual and welcoming."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've received in awhile. I was passing through town to go mountain biking at McDowell Mtn. Park and wanted to grab a slice of pizza. The place wasn't busy because it was around 1:30 pm but the service was very slow and inept. It took about 15 minutes for the girl to slice off a slice of already baked pizza, stick it back in the oven, and then put it in a medium size to-go box even though I asked to eat it in at the restaurant. Also, the place was very dingy and dirty. The window coverings had dust on them like they hadn't been cleaned in months. Skip it."}
{"text":"Fairly close to a New York slice, just ask for a little more well done on the slices, and you've got a hot cheesy, crispy crusted piece of awesome.  Don't get your wings here; head to Pisa Pizza in town for that.  They have big yummy salads too.  

I give 4 stars only because I think they should be a little more competative on their pricing, and expand the lunch special a bit."}
{"text":"My go-to pizza spot when I'm in Fountain Hills. I can't get enough... The pizza is a must do. I only wish they had one in Milwaukee. Cheesy, saucy, juicy and craveable... Not to mention the owner went to the Culinary Institute of America. I can't wait to get a slice of pie next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Such a good place! The food was absolutely delicious! The service was wonderful! The staff is so friendly. The atmosphere is great. It is such a cute, quaint little place. Pricing was reasonable, and actual quite affordable for the quality food received! Will come back and refer to friends! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the Valley - no doubt about it! Every ex NYer here in Az looks for a pizzeria with the perfect blend and combination of the sauce, crust, cheese and yes, got to fold that slice as that oil drips down. For 5 years, this restaurant has been that one place that consistently delivers. The pasta dishes are really good and their Greek salad is awesome ( and huge).  Awesome and happy chef named Victor and great cashier and waitress Alejandra really go the extra mile. For any of the folks driving up the Beeline to the Casino or Peyson, you have got to take that left on Shea and check this place out. Simply the best!"}
{"text":"This is my second favorite pizza place I have ever had. I went here for lunch and said what the he** lets try it it had good reviews on YELP. I got the 2 slice lunch combo. The pizza is thinner and crispy. Not soggy thin crust. Good cheese and toppings. The server was great and the place is really nice inside. Kinda small but great decor."}
{"text":"This is my favorite italian restaurant in the Valley! Tucked away in charming Fountain Hills, this restaurant has a decent view of Red Mountain. Although it sits inside a strip mall when you first walk in you feel like you've taken a time machine to 1950s Chicago with the brick walls and Frank Sinatra music. It's a great place for lunch and with it's dim lights and cozy booths it would be perfect for a first date. The food is superb. A few of my favorites include the stuffed pizza (the sauce is the perfect amount of sweet and salty) and the Penne ala Vodka."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Loved the 40-50's decor. The food was outstanding with great flavor and presentation. The service was outstanding and the wait was minimal. The chicken just melted in you mouth. The dessert was awesome."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town sometimes... Run out of pizza topping ingredients often, pricey, tell you 15 minutes and it's ready for pick up- EVERY time it's never ready. End up waiting in the store another 15 minutes- just annoying. They have discontinued our fave pizza just recently, up until then they didn't have the ingredients and cheaper substitutes were made- never discounted.... Please, the cost is quite different between prosciutto and Canadian bacon . Looking for somewhere else unfortunately, quality has seriously gone down."}
{"text":"Do'H !!!!!  I could have swore I posted a review for Redendo's, but I guess I didn't!
Yes, I really think they have the best pizza in FH.  Are a little higher priced than some of the others in town, but the flavor & quality is awesome. Good work !"}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed this pizza in the past. Not good at present - orders not correct, miscommunication between workers? I called after our 3rd pizza order that was not correct and all I got was \"I'm sorry - we had a change in our staff.\" Did Redendo's  get sold or something? 3 Times in a row of this - we will not return."}
{"text":"Having grown up in NY, I'm always looking for good pizza during my travels, but am rarely successful. We were in Fountain Hills for about two weeks and after our first visit to Redendo's we had to go back for another lunch. The pizza (by the slice!) is exactly what I hoped for, and the calzone was excellent too. We also got the garlic knots and unfortunately they weren't quite up to NY standards, but that doesn't hold me back from gladly giving 5 stars. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the atmosphere inside was cozy and nice."}
{"text":"This is our go-to stop when we are headed out of town up the hill to Payson, or beyond to ShowLow.  Locally owned, which is always important, the food is great. They serve wine and beer, and it is a solid bet among a stop filled with greasy, gross fast food and chain madness. It is literally one of the only independants that has stood in the past few years. All the more reason to visit them.

But beside the fact that they are family owned. They are delicious. Thin and crispy pizza, Salads are terrific. My favorite is made with spinach balsalmic, bacon, mushrooms, blue cheese and red onions and homemade croutons oh wow. Wine is good, My girlfriend loves their chicken parmesean with a little alfredo sauce on top.  

The alfredo is a little thin for my taste, but I usually just go for a slice and that great salad with a glass of chianti. 

Next time you are on the edge of Fountain Hills, check this place out. It was a place we literally just stumbled across one day, because it is practically hidden behind a behemith McDonald's and a Circle K, but what a gem."}
{"text":"We had a terrific lunch here yesterday.  The pizza has a great crispy bottom and tender middle, and sauce and cheese are perfect.  Got the garlic knots and meatballs for appetizers and they were really fantastic as well.  A new favorite place for us and well worth our trip to Fountain Hills.  Thanks Redendo's!!"}
{"text":"This is for the new owner:  \"that guy's pizza\". 

I've had bad luck getting pizza at this place in the past. Very bad customer service, below average
Pizza. And had decided not to bother anymore. But, I thought I'd try again after reading it was under new ownership. Let me tell you, a world of difference!  

I didn't call ahead. I just came in and ordered. Took about 15 minutes. Pizza was hot, cooked just right, and the ingredients tasted fresh (this was a problem under old ownership of the past)

And to top it off, they even cut the pizza the correct way, unlike so many Arizona pizza joints who insist on cutting pizza in child like bite size squares.  (Seriously. I've lived in over 15 different states and have never seen that unless it was a rectangular party type pizza). 

Once they have delivery open, fountain hills will finally have a fantastic delivery option and Pizza Hut won't be the king of delivery in FH anymore."}
{"text":"Servi e was great and Pizza was delicious. The kids loved the garlic knots n marinara. My family will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Great food,  went here a handful of times.  Everything was delicious until last time. Salad wasn't fresh.  Everything else was delicious including dessert. Meatballs are excellent.  Pizza and calzones are the best we have had.  Quiet atmosphere.  Very small dining area so best to get there when not busy.  Amazing pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I love Redendos! The food is delicious and every one is always so friendly and helpful. All 9f their pizza salad and pasta options are great, but I highly recommend the Buffalo chicken calzone! It's really good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite little pizza place, in a town that for some reason has 10 places for pizza. It's a family owned place, with awesome decor all over the walls. It feels like 1947 in there, but in a good way. I go once or twice a week for the A-Bomb hero. The pizza is really good too. Really nice people, really good food, really cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pizza and pasta were both very good. 
Unlike a lot of places we did not have to wait. Pizza goes right in the oven and comes right out. 
Meatballs were firm and yet not hard. Very tasty. 
Chicago style pizza was very good. Has pepperoni and meatballs and was heavy (as it should be!). 
Eggplant parmigiana was good but not excellent. 
Pepperoni pinwheel was very good."}
{"text":"we're from Chicago and were thrilled to find this.  very resaonable, excellent service, adorable atmosphere, homemade pasta dishes, excellent.  Pizza, Antipasti Salad and Pasta Primavera were wonderful.  Counter service, but entrees are brought to the table.  I assume bathrooms were behind counter, did not see.  We will be back."}
{"text":"After getting stiffed at Sofritas  we decided to head out and find a place to eat. We decided on Redendos Pizza. It is kind of a small place and no rest room facilities. 
When you go in you need to go up to the counter to place your order. They sell beer, wine and assorted soft drinks. My girlfriend still wanted the Sangria that she was denied at Sofritas so she ordered that and unfortunately they were out :(

We found out the Sofrita's was their sister restaurant. Suddenly it came to me, lure you in with Sangria that is not there. 

We ordered some Calzones and sat down for some libation's. When the calzones showed up they looked great and tasted even greater. They were big and we could only eat half of them. I recommend the 4 item calzone for $9.95 well worth the price.

We are happy with Redendo's, good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Quaint, fun, and delicious. Good ingredients, clean and groovy atmosphere. Crust is on the thin and \"chewy\" side, and does not disappoint. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Family run awesome neighborhood New York Italian restaurant. The food is excellent and the smaller dining area lends to a friendly, neighborly experience. Pizza, Salads, Pasta, Calzones, Garlic Knots, Pepperoni Pinwheels, Wine and Daily Specials mean there is something for everyone and the whole family. Easy location at corner of Shea Blvd & Saguaro Blvd."}
{"text":"Another five star service restaurant in Fountain Hills. I think people here are just very nice. We came here for weekday night quick dinner the other day, and I really had nice pleasant time dining here.

It wasn't crowded at all at dinner time, very small place, six or eight tables (can't remember exactly). You order at the counter first and they will bring your food.  Since it wasn't the full table service restaurant, I wasn't expecting much but the staff took our order came back to our table at least 4 or 5 times over the course of dinner to make sure we were doing well. He brought a big bottle of water, and when we finished a bottle, he came back with more.

Food was good, I liked the pizza I ordered. Garlic knots and marinara sauce was nice appetizer to have.  Pasta meat sauce wasn't what I expected but we ate all anyway.  It's so close to my house, I think I will add their number to my phone, so I can order pizza from them whenever I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Great experience at Redendo's the lady that took my order was fantastic, real down home feel. She Was very engaging and takes to my daughter and made her feel right at home. Great food and fantastic atmosphere. I will back soon"}
{"text":"This is a very small place.  Only a few tables/booths.  Yes there is a rest room but for patrons only.  Ihave been here before.  My firiend loves their spaghetti and meat sauce and the garlic knots.  This time I had their A Bomb sandwich which is genoa salami, black forest ham, provolone and balsamic dtessing.  The sandwich was delicious!  The roll reminded me of Costanza's back home (Buffalo) crispy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside!  I love the decor with the old standards music playing.  If I had anything negative to say it is a bit dark, maybe just a little more soft lighting?  Overall, very clean, very attentive waitpersons."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Fountain Hills over 7 years ago, Redendo's was a fairly new business.  I stopped in and decided to see if Arizona Pizza would be any better than Atlanta Pizza (where I lived for almost 8 years and couldn't find more than a couple of palatable NY style Pizza joints).

I was quickly spoiled by Redendo's.  The pizza was better than anything in Atlanta, and as good if not better than most in the NYC/NJ area I grew up in.

it didn't take long talking to the owner Anthony and his wife Caroline to figure out these were a couple of NY natives that took not only their Pizza seriously, but their Italian cooking as well.  

In those 7 plus years, Redendo's has become the place for me to pick up food on the way home from work, when I just don't want to cook.  It is not only the place we take visitors from back east, but it's where those visitors demand to be taken when they return.

Sometimes you just want a slice of great pizza, and I highly recommend you try it, but do NOT make the mistake of ignoring their other fantastic offerings.  The Calzones are not only to die for, but they are massive.  Their hot and cold sandwiches all satisfy.  My personal favorite is the A-Bomb, which would likely be called simply an \"italian sub\" or \"hoagie\" in NJ.  

Redendo's is not only the best \"Pizza\" place in Arizona, but best Italian Restaurant in Arizona.  It just happens to be in a \"pizza joiint\"!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Had the sausage appetizer which arrived cut into good size pieces within a bowl of marinara; my wife had the capers and sauce smthered chicken piccata and we split a side salad.  Great portions for very little $.  Not sure where their rest room was; perhaps behind the counter or maybe they share with another of the connected restaurants on the strip but we didn't ask.  Will definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place if I'm looking for quality food at a decent price and quick. You walk in and order at a counter and they bring you your food. If this was a full-service restaurant, the food would be outstanding still. Quality food, reasonable prices, good service,"}
{"text":"Too inconsistent for me.  Crust tends to be overcooked so if like that, this is the place.  Ingredients are fine, especially the sausage.  NYC atmosphere is interesting and seating area small but adequate."}
{"text":"Great authentic NY pizza. Get the large for $1 more. Small but cool inside space although you'd never guess it from the outside."}
{"text":"Still yucky.  picked up an order which should have been hot, hard as a rock like cardboard and burnt on the bottom.  There are many other places in town for good pizza avoid this and you will be more than happy.  Hit and Miss place, mostly Miss"}
{"text":"Yoose wants some good NY pizza?! All's you got is three choices, good pizza, better pizza,  and best pizza! Now get outta here!"}
{"text":"Great pizza - the flavors and crust were really good! My only disappointment with my order was the greek salad. It had 3 or 4 different types of olives on it and while I love olives, there was so much that it was overpowering. Was hoping for more of a traditional greek salad. Overall good good!"}
{"text":"Redendo's is always delicious. You can always count on getting a high quality meal. The pizzas are New York style and cooked to perfection using quality ingrediants.
There are a variety of salads which come in two different sizes. I call them \"huge\" and \"really huge.\" I always get the Greek Empire salad. The dressing is amazing, and they pack it full of olives, which makes it even more incredible. 
The garlic knots are doughy and seasoned. I love the sauce that you dip them in as well. Grade A on everything.
My husband loves the Meatball Sandwich and the Pizza of course.
Cute atmosphere, very small.  Old school. Lots of Rat Pack on the stereo."}
{"text":"We tried Redendo's for the first time and everything was delicious and fresh. The service was great and the restaurant clean. We ordered the antipasto salad, chicken wings, meatballs, a piece of stuffed Chicago-Style pizza, and a slice of pizza with pineapple and other goodies on it. Everything was yummy."}
{"text":"I went to Redendo's a week or two ago after seeing a show. I had gone to Redendo's several times many years ago and always remembered it being really good! They didn't disappoint this time. I shared a calzone with the BF and it was extremely large and flavorful. You get to choose 4 toppings for the calzone and it was still under 10$. If I were in Fountain Hills I would go back, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip to eat here."}
{"text":"Pizza is not cardboard like at all... But I really wouldn't know cause I've never eaten cardboard before. Read reviews of this place and it was really up and down, so I needed to see for myself. 

First thing, awesome prices! It's very reasonable, $2.75 by the slice for pepperoni. I brought a drink, so my lunch was cheap, even if I wanted 2 slices, it would have only been about 6 bucks. They have appetizers, pastas, entrees, hot and cold subs, calzones, deserts, and of course pizza! All low priced for this area. I normally spend 10-15 bucks on lunch. But not here!

The cute girl at the front said everything is good here and there is really not a specific popular item, so i ordered my pizza and it was on the table really hot and and ready to eat. 

This was my first experience, and I will definitely come back and try the other various menu items. 

I'm very satisfied with the service, food, and prices. I don't really think you can beat this place in the area it's in and at lunch time."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been customers for as long as this pizzeria has been open. And we LOVE Redendo's. My opinion is that this is the best pizza/pasta in FH area, and even beyond. Their crust is consistently excellent, but what I love most is that they use quality ingredients in their toppings and creating their other cuisine. (I am ex-foodservice distribution, so I know quality when I see it). I also like the NYC 1940's ambiance which the owners have re-created here. You don't see that too often anymore.

It's small in size, but not cramped; and consistently well-staffed. I highly recommend Redendo's to all who appreciate great NY-style pizza, and a 1940's Americana ambiance if dining in. They have a N. Scottsdale location as well."}
{"text":"We've ordered take out from Redendo's a couple of times. It wasn't too bad. However, I ate at this location with my family a few weeks ago, and I have to say the pizza was actually better than I remembered. The pizza's a little greasy, but the crust was light and both crispy and soft. 

The only gripe I had with the place is that when we walked in, no one said anything to us. We sat in a booth for ten minutes waiting for a server. We finally went to the front counter to ask what was going on, and they told us that you go to the counter to order. This isn't a problem; however, it might have been nice to know that when we walked in--rather than sitting there wondering what was happening. One of the employees could have easily asked how we were doing. At that time, we were the only people in the place, and we were sitting in direct view of the employees. 

Coincidentally, after wasting ten minutes sitting there, wondering what was going on, and then taking a few minutes to order once we learned how the place operated, a family of eight people (complete with kids) came in and ordered in front of us. This wasn't the restaurant's fault, but it was like adding insult to injury!

We'll be back, but perhaps ownership could put up a sign, or better yet, encourage employees to greet customers when they walk in. 

Good food; fair to poor service."}
