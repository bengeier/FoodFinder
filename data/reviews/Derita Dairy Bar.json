{"text":"Love love love this place!!!! I love the cheeseburgers the best. Great ice cream, fries, ice tea and banana pudding"}
{"text":"This place has changed hands from my last visit. The quality has gone way down. A simple vanilla soft serve cone was icy and granular with a very artificial taste. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been hesitant to review this place due to being greedy but finally have to brake down and do it. Great milkshakes and ice cream but the real reason I come here is the chili cheese burger. The chili has a nice spice to it always fresh burgers served up quick. Not place to sit just a walk up window eat in your car. This place is a local favorite in derita and damn good place to grab a burger hot dog or milkshake"}
