{"text":"Pizza is so subjective, but this is my favorite pizza delivery in Vegas by far.  The ingredients all are good quality and it's cooked east coast style, so the crust is not too thick or thin.  Couple of other New York style places on the far west side in Summerlin, but this one is definitely better.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.  Also, the girl who took my order was friendly and competent and the delivery guy was courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"A friend and myself went across town Tropicana/Boulder Hwy. to check out  what one of my FaceBook friends said was out of this world pizza so had to find out for ourselves, he was right!!!

We had the White Pie and a order of wings which I liked that you put the sauce on them by putting them in a bag with the sauce you want and shake it up. 

After we finished out dinner we tried the Maple Mascarpone Cheesecake, I hoped nobody had seen me lick the bowl it came it.

It's worth the trip, Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Usually I give tell everyone this is the best pizza in Vegas but my last visit was disappointing.  Quality was just okay and therefore this time they get just an okay review from me.  Hopefully next visit it will be the quality ZA that I a rave about & am use too!"}
{"text":"We had an Awesome Philly cheese steak and a large pizza - total was about $30. Quality of the food was great , the guys working there were awesome - all in all a great little place - worth the trek off the strip . Defo a must visit"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and cheesesteaks! A must try when in Vegas! 5 stars, great service and very friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! I ordered the spicy Italian red with meatballs. I loved the thin crust and light tomato sauce, the meatballs were bursting with flavors of herbs and garlic and the broccoli rage was a nice touch of flavor and color. I will definitely order fit here again!!"}
{"text":"They added Spinach to their menu. Last night I had the best Veggie Pie that I have eaten in over 10 years.  I have been with them since they opened and they were good then, but really stepped it up.  Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"An oasis in a desert of mediocre pizza.  From their signature pies to a la cartel orders, they are the masters of piedom.  And their sandwiches, chicken and sides will appeal to the most discerning palate.  Get your bad self down here today!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza!  Thin crust that is light and chewy.  

We had a small pie of half Big Sexy and half pepperoni and olives.  Simply great.

We also had a cheesestake while the pizza was being made.  It was also outstanding.  Perhaps the best we've ever had.  

Seating very limited but we made it work.  Staff very nice.

Give it a go."}
{"text":"Excellent place from the food to the customer service to the location. Huge portions I always get the Philly cheese steak with cheese fries. A little pricey but way worth it. By far my one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new pizza place, even more so when we heard it was from the same guys at Secret Pizza at the Cosmo. Really wanted to like this place, but it was not meant to be. The mishaps started when we tried to call ahead for pickup. The first time we called it went to a voicemail box after several rings with no way to leave a message (not that we would anyway). We double checked that the number was correct and that they should be open. The same thing happened with the second call. I don't know what possessed us to try yet again, but the third time our call was answered. Not an auspicious start... What a great way to lose a lot of potential business from less tenacious, potential customers.

We ordered the Italian white pizza ($22) and a spinach salad ($7) and were told it would be ready in 30 minutes. I arrived about 35 minutes later and was told my order was not quite ready yet. As I was paying for my order, I noticed that they were just putting my pizza into the oven. WTH? Really? I guess that's a new personal first... When we get pizza from anywhere else, we are told 20 minutes (sometimes 30 minutes if it's prime time on Fri night), and when we show up it is usually ready or occasionally comes out of the oven a couple minutes after arrival. Here, I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for the pizza to be cooked and then another 5 minutes of so for them to construct the spinach salad. So basically, it took another 15 minutes after I arrived for my order to be ready for a total time of 50 minutes from when I called. It should go without saying that it shouldn't take 50 minutes to prepare your take-out pizza order. Even if that was acceptable, they shouldn't tell you 30 minutes, only for you to show up and wait significantly longer. It wasn't like they were busy. I was the only customer there until this other guy showed up to pick up his pizza which they just started to put in the oven as I was leaving. I guess I'm not the only one...

We were hoping that after all this, at least the food would be worth the wait. Not by a long shot... Although it smelled pretty good, the pizza crust was undercooked so we stuck it in the oven for another 5 minutes. Despite this, the pizza crust was quite soggy in the middle and pretty greasy throughout. The broccoli rabe topping was tough, and the homemade sausage was nothing special. My wife commented that she would rather have Dom DeMarco's pizza, and she doesn't even like their pizza! Of note, they included tiny containers of red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan which was a nice touch. The spinach salad was even more disappointing. It was lined with an anemic pita (not included in the salad description) and contained a relatively small amount of wilted, soggy spinach dressed with some bacon lardons, goat cheese, and candied almonds.

We'll be sticking with our tried and true, Rocco's Pizza, where the crust is cooked properly, it's not too greasy, the toppings taste better, it's ready in 20 minutes, and it even costs less ($18). Sorry, Those Guys Pies. I just tell it how it is, and you've got a long way to go."}
{"text":"Love it! Had the Greek pizza. Amazing! Chicken fingers. Amazing!  Fresh chicken sliced in strips, battered and quick fried. Yum. BLT. Amazing!  Cheese steak. Amazing!  Meatball sub. Amazing!  Chef Roy has nailed it. Try anything on the menu, so good. Even the salads are great. I see why 3ds did a segment on them. Roy hits a homerun with his menu.  Definitely a favorite! Friday nights a Greek pizza and a good bottle of wine. I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered the original Philly cheese steak sandwich. When i got home I opened up the wrapping my sandwich seems small. So i got my ruler out and it was only 8 inches. The guy told me that they cut off 2 inches because i didnt get it with vegetables. That they do it by weight. I find this odd as i never get the vegetables and it wasnt that small before. They offered to remake it but I am not even able to get there my friend had picoed it up for me and i am not interested in ordering here ever again. They should disclose the fact that they chop off  2 inches of your sandwich."}
{"text":"I have ordered here plenty of times, and never have I been let down. In fact, when they were closed for filming I was not mad, I was hurt that I couldn't get my TGP fix. Lol. Their wings are always delicious and fresh, love their Thai peanut sauce and honey wasabi. But you really couldn't go wrong with any of the flavors they offer. So far I have tried a majority of their pies, all white sauces and WOW. Not to mention anything that comes out of their fryer is also always amazing.They truly outshine any other delivery services around here. They have kind people working there, delivery is always on time and food is always hot and fresh. I just ordered a BBQ chicken pie, fried mushrooms (YUM), and wings and am super excited!"}
{"text":"The best pizza by far in Las Vegas. They only use the freshest ingredients in their pizza. Their flavor profiles are amazing. But the crust, the crust takes me back to New York. Their crust will out shine any pizza place that I have ever eaten at in NY, and I was born and raised in NY. You wont be disappointed. Try anything on the menu...."}
{"text":"I HAPPILY RECANT MY LAST REVIEW! I wanted to give this restaurant another try, and I am highly satisfied with not only the pizza but the chef himself! He took the time to reach out converse with me personally!! I can see he really cares about his customers and meals they provide for them.The BBQ Chicken is delicious!! And I hope this will be my permanent cheesesteak provider because I love cheesesteaks. I'm looking forward to my next order! THANKYOU FOR UNDERSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Half white. Half red-pep. Cut into squares, please. You allllll know who this is! My wife and I have ordered well over 20 pies from this joint and each one is better than the next! I have to moan at times because my request is often forgotten (cut in squares) but it doesn't keep us from calling the following week! Cheesesteak is the best I've had without and Whiz. Hawaiian pizza with that homemade bacon is haunting me and the fingers, cheesticks and cinnamon poppers are OUT OF CONTROL AMAZING! Those Guys Pies are knowledgeable in their craft and delivery drivers are the nicest, always greeting us so welcoming over the phone or at our door! Keep it up Guys

Edit: Spelling"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this for a couple days now...I'll save the story but I've only been on the west coast 6 years (so I know a good cheesesteak vs. a \"steakum\") Been searching for a GOOD cheesesteak foreverrrrr! This place was recommended and OMG - they didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing new York style pizza! White pizza, delicious. Chicken fingers are to die for with  \"those guys pies\" sriracha sauce!"}
{"text":"Drove 45 mins to try this place and definitely worth the trip. They're kinda of hidden in a small shopping center and houses. 

Ordered a white/garlic and sausage pizza. Love the crust and the flavors. Also the hot wings were delicious. They give u two sauce on the sides, depends on your choice."}
{"text":"Been searching for the best cheesesteak on the west coast.  Finally Those Guys Pies have Made the top spot...  Thank you!!!! See you later today for the perfect football sandwich"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and wings. Authentic, fresh ingredients and flavor. A real treat above the horde of franchise shops that produce the same skimpy product. 

Watch for Those Guys on Guy Fieri's, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, they were there last week filming an episode."}
{"text":"Went to Those Guys Pies when i was in Las Vegas and tasted both the pizza and cheese steak sandwich since people claim its very good!!! I Have to say the Pizza was pretty good. Good quality ingredients and tasted Great! The Cheese Steak Sandwich was Good and had a good Taste but it Sure was Not Huge like it seemed to be on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" Overall it was Good!"}
{"text":"This place was featured in the show Diners Drive-Ins and Dives, my husband saw the episode and when he went back to Las Vegas this summer he took my daughter with him and they both went to have \"THE BEST PIZZA EVER!!\" according to my daughter. Well last saturday my husband and i drove to Vegas and of course i told him to take me to Those Guys Pies. i have to agree with my daughter this is the Best Pizza Ever!! is in a hidden little shopping center very small place but is worth the drive to get there....Pizza is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I have to give a star to give a review so I picked one. Their food quality has gone down big time. Not only is their pizza disgusting, GREASY, and mushy but I got a salad today and I feel sick to my stomach! It was bitter and I even found a hair in it. He put a tortilla at the bottom... why!?! And why do they put random stuff in their grilled cheese without putting it on their menu. The chef there isn't a a chef at all. They just need to close."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Las Vegas for a couple of nights.  We decided to eat in rather than go out to eat.  We had a craving for pizza.  I researched on Yelp and found this restaurant.  I saw that the restaurant was featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  I've never been to a restaurant that was featured on that show so we decided to try it.  It was a 20 minute drive from our hotel.

Let me tell you, and I am not exaggerating.....this was one of the best pizzas that I ever had.  We ordered a large pizza, one half was vegetarian for my wife, the other was the BBQ Maui Waui.  Just fantastic.  I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in the Las Vegas area and has a craving for pizza.

Also, I believe that it was the owner that was there.  Great guy....asked how my Xmas was.....just a gentleman."}
{"text":"If you want real pizza with real ingredients you will have to pay a little more for it. Order a $6.00 pizza and get a piece of cardboard. These guys have the crust exactly the way I like it. Give it a shot, well worth the money."}
{"text":"Just tried Those Guy's Pies.  All I can say is Yummmmm! Lived in Vegas for years and I gotta say is this one  of the best pizza pies I've had here.  Tried the white pizza and it was delish.  Also their chicken fingers were amazing! My new addiction!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Cheese steaks are also great!! I am from Union county NJ and been in town for 10 years. These guys are by far the best"}
{"text":"Everything I have has at Those Guys has impressed me. The wings are crispy and juicy every time and the sauces have good flavor. Pizzas are one of the best in Vegas. In particular the buffalo pizza and pizza with homemade meatballs and pepperoni. Recently tried the pizza steak sandwich. Full of flavor and satisfying. Been there over 8 times now and the quality is high and consistency is excellent. I have nothing bad to say about this establishment."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new. We ordered the white pie veggie pizza and the lakeside salad. Oh em gee! That pizza was so delicious! Very flavorful! As a meat lover I was surprised to know I didn't miss the meat. The portabella mushrooms were so buttery and the artichoke hearts very tasty. The salad....wow! I am upset I haven't had it before. All the flavors were wonderful. Those Guys Pies never disappoint. Oh... I ordered delivery. They said an hour and a half. Got it in 35 minutes. Smiley face!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheesecake! First visit. Looking forward to trying more stuff on the menu. Lakeside view is around the corner. Was featured on the triple d!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion...best pizza in the area (lakes). I've only had the cheese pizza butttt it's delicious! Dough is good and cooked to perfect"}
{"text":"This place had fast delivery however the food was horrible.  I read these reviews and ordered the Spicy Italian Red and an original cheese steak and they were horrible.  Entirely flavorless, the cheese steak was soggy and bland.  Unfortunately I found the reviews misleading and probably wont be ordering from there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm from NY but my Dad's from Philly so I've been there many times. Cheesesteaks are one of my favorite meals and they make a genuine Philadelphia Cheesesteak. Top of the line steak sandwich right here. The guy I talked to was from philly, I assume he's the owner but I'm not sure.

Just created a yelp account to review this place!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. Its a quickie pizza or cheesesteak place. Deffinately my fav to get a delivery from in Lakes local area. Im down with the brown paper bags and house made sauces! You outta towner/yelp/douchebags  can stay where u are from. This place is pure local luv. If i see you on your phones while im waiting for my pie, yelpin this place down, YOU WILL EAT YOUR PHONE , AND IM GONNA TAKE YOUR PIE ! This place has epic cheesy bread too. My last 3 experiences here were great. Keep up the good stuff TGP!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza to be delivered   It arrived dry and cold and LATE I'd only pick it up    Taste ok"}
{"text":"After stumbling on this place, I tried it a week ago myself to check it out. Being from NJ, its hard to find a real cheese steak here. It was so good, I brought my eleven friends back the next day."}
{"text":"I have been dying to go here and check out the east coast pizza vibe. I have not had a good chicken fingers sub in years.  Saw this joint on DDD, I finally committed to drive out to west bum excited to try this place out. Heading back to Southern Cal from Utah the place is not close to the route home, but today was the day my son and I stepped up.

It's small,  a couple tables, geared for take out local.  Having been on the road I had to pee and they don't have bathroom, frustrating.   

To be fair, the  food is better than 2 stars but service and the mistakes made me rank it 2 stars overall.  

After waiting several minutes (Ignored) at the register to order. I ordered a small cheese pizza and a chicken fingers hoagie (Sub) it comes with lettuce, tomato and mayo, I added and paid extra for provolone. After a long wait, They had  burnt the first pizza (more wait) and had to cook another one. We got a plain cheese and It ended up tasting good.  After a wait, my sub showed up with no mayo, no cheese. It came dry with lettuce and ??? sun dried tomatoes??? I gave up, waited for the pizza and ate my sub asking for a side of mayo to spread myself. I let the cheese go and picked out the dry tomatoes. 

This place is a local take out place, if your not on the west side of Vegas, it's not with the trip. I kicked in an extra star because the food was decent but I won't go back. Not with the trip. Sorry Guys, I wanted to love it."}
{"text":"I ordered from these guys based on all the glowing reviews.  I live 5 min from the store so I ignored the reviews that said the crust was soggy.  Well, that's just what I got.  It's not a bad pizza but I don't think it lived up to the reviews.  A real east coast pizza slice should stand up to the moisture.  The dough lacks that wonderful yeast flavor and the cheese was nothing special.  The spinach was MIA but there were tons of mushrooms so not a deal breaker.  The crust was cooked through and wasn't burned but I wish it had some flavor.  There was very little sauce and that's a good thing considering it would have made it even more soggy.  All that said I will give them one more chance.  The pizza is pricey but I would pay more for an excellent pie."}
{"text":"First and LAST time I'll eat this food. No crispy snap to the wings at all. Rubbery and just flat out not right. Pizza was even terrible. For a place that prides itself on pizza and boasts the Food Network card, I really expected a pie that would impress me over any other pizza I've had (and I've had quite a few). If a cheese pizza cant be made well, to me, that tells the whole story. Get wings and a pie from Tap House and then this place. You'll taste the difference."}
{"text":"The most disgusting sausage green pepper and onion pizza I've ever had the displeasure to eat in my life"}
{"text":"First time trying this pizzeria. It was fabulous. Had the cheese steak hoagie and wings. Just like back East.  It was amazing. Will definitely be back to try their pizza. Very nice staff. Thank you."}
{"text":"I lived in Boston for 18 years before moving to Las Vegas.  I had my favorite pizzeria, a spot in Brighton Corner.  It didn't look like anything special.  But sit at one of the cheap formica tables a while & you might notice the Italian newspapers strewn about, then that the gentlemen behind the counter are all speaking Italian.  What the place lacked in fancy decor it more than made up for with authenticity.

And my point, you ask?  I have really high standards for my pizza.  I signori at Brighton Corner made the best red sauce I've ever tasted and used a pepperoni that was like no other.  For years in Vegas, I looked for pizza that was 80% as good.  Then I gave up &  looked for pizza that was half as good.  Still nothing, until I discovered Those Guys.

No, neither their red sauce nor their pepperoni are as good as i signori, but they're reasonably close.  And Those Guys' crust is actually better.  It's a big plus that Those Guys make their own sausage, meatballs, and even smoke their own bacon.  Also, TG makes a cheesesteak with the best quality beef you'll ever find in a hoagie.

Despite the 20-minute drive, I go to Those Guys fairly often (once every couple of weeks).  It's a bit of a distance to go for pizza, but it's a lot closer than Brighton Corner."}
{"text":"I normally do not do this but I had too because they deserve it.  

I heard so many good things about this place I had to try it. Besides the owner being from South Jersey and myself too it was a must to try.

Well, the pepperoni pizza, cheesesteak and veggie sandwich was delicious....and no I did not eat all this myself. I use to think Caps had the best cheesesteak for Vegas....NO MORE!

STOP...reading these reviews and pick up the phone and place your order...you will not be disappointed. This place ROCKS!!

All the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pie for delivery. The delivery was 45 mins late & the pie tasted and felt like it was made 2 days ago.. complete let-down"}
{"text":"This is the best veggie pizza in town!!! Their Greek Pie is to die for. Perfect and fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned. Delivery takes a little longer, but the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"I had to drop their rating down.  The service is really good and the employees are super nice.

BUT the last 4-5 times we ordered, either the pizza or chicken (and once both) arrived disgustingly undercooked.  

I've been ordering pizza somewhere else but it's not the best either...  I might start ordering from them again if the other spot gets even worse..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the spicy Italian pie is one our favorite. Good pizza good service"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places ever, will miss greatly when we move. Live the spicy Italian red with bacon instead of sausage. My kids really like the cheese and the cinnamon poppers. We also tried big sexy, shroom and Italian white, they were all delicious."}
{"text":"Obviously my review hit a nerve. Go ahead and see for yourself. We saw it with our own eyes... and left without eating. It's up to you, but we ended up having  a delicious pizza that day at New York Pizza and Pasta. Our server was adorable. She comped us appetizers and fresh cannoli."}
{"text":"i'm new to the neighbourhood, and during a rainy day of unpacking and barely being able to find plates, let alone find the energy to even warm up a can of soup, because who only KNOWS where the cookware is, i decided to take a break, and order a pizza...but who to order from? after typing pizza delivery into yelp, and my new zip code, this place popped up, after reading some of the reviews, decided to give them a try.

i ordered the \"shroom\" pizza on white (white means the fact that there is no pizza sauce, just a combination of garlic oil and ricotta cheese), to add at least SOME health aspects, i added artichokes to the pie, this is what i got.

an aroma that wafted onto my palate way before the box was even opened. aside from the fact that it was covered with cheeses (ricotta and mozzarella) the crust was actually edible, not like many pizza crusts, that get tossed to the wayside because they are too tough, hard, or doughy, this crust was just what a pizza crust should be, slightly crunchy on the outside, and slightly doughy and chewy on the in.

the only problem i have was that even though the pizza was laden, the toppings were slim...that and they forget to send me a menu.

personally can't wait for the next rainy day as an excuse to avoid cooking and order a pizza from them again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and mine was perfectly cooked. May be a little greasy for some but the crust was the best I've ever had. It was just crisp enough on the bottom and chewy. Perfect!"}
{"text":"best in town no doubt. Sure it ain't the cheapest but value it out of this world"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience.  I order two pies for delivery later that day, called early so they would be on time.  They were more than 20 mins. late and the Pizza was horrible.  It was so greasy we needs to use a paper towel to absorb the excess grease before we ate a slice.  The taste was unfortunately not very good, we had a Meat and a Veggie, both tasted lousy.  I selected this company because of all the great reviews but in this instance they didn't do a good job."}
{"text":"Great people, great food, just a little expensive. The Works cheesesteak, fries, and  bottle of water was about $20."}
{"text":"Very good food and the owner and his staff will make sure you are happy!! It is nice to see an owner of a great place ask for feedback ... His product shows his commitment to excellence. It makes me want to try a cheesesteak / and I have never met a cheese stake that I like. :-)"}
{"text":"Well this was a a waste of 80 dollars. This place has the audacity to serve its customers over cooked chicken tenders. Undercooked frozen meatballs and warm deserts. I'm never spending my money here again. STAY AWAY FROM THESE IDIOTS !"}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had in a long long time!! Personally made by the owner himself.. what a hell of a guy!

Enjoy the BST guys!"}
{"text":"You must try this piazza. The spices are fantastic and made to perfection. Its a bit out of the way but well worth every mile. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Also try their cheesecakes.....fabulous for desert."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Guy Feddi's show and thought I would check it out. The pizza we had was the cheesesteak and the mozzarella sticks. It was amazing. It was busy but totally worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I personally love the BBQ Chicken Pizza, Maui Wowie, and the Big Sexy. My brother loves the cheese steaks, and my sister loves the chicken wings and fingers. The staff is awesome and so down to earth. And the owner is a super cool guy. You can never go wrong with ordering Those Guys Pies. And if you do, try the Pineapple Buffalo Sauce! (all of the sauces are good, but that's my favorite)"}
{"text":"3rd time is the charm!  Have called in and picked up 3 times from Those Guys.  Every time, my order has been ready when promised and the people answering the phone and taking orders have been  very pleasant. 

My family is a big fan of the chicken fingers.  We skip the sauce and just get extra fingers.  

Today we tried the Italian White Pizza.  Lots of garlic and ricotta cheese.  A little pricey, but worth it.  

Looking forward to trying the rest of their pizzas.  

We found the cheesesteak to be too salty and not worth the price.  There are better cheesesteak options in Las Vegas and on the west side of town.

Overall... two thumbs up for Those Guys.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try! The pizza was amazing!  Cooked perfectly. I went in to order and it was ready in 15 minutes.  The staff is friendly! If you're looking for a great  pizza this is the place to get it!"}
{"text":"Positive - Some of the best pizza in Las Vegas! Try the Mowie Wowie pizza! And the 3 cheese fries! Wow! They also have a very nice app and they accept Apple Pay. 

Negative - Very limited delivery area."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a fantastic cheesesteak. Not to many places get both priorities right when it comes to cheesesteak; ground/ribeye and cheese whiz!  Top it off with onions, peppers, and jalapeño 's it's heavenly!

My favorite in Vegas. Has an edge over Pop's especially the area. Pop's is in the ghetto kind of. IMHO"}
{"text":"Went here thinking it was a restaurant, but got a pizza anyway. The white pizza was so overly greasy and mushy after waiting 40 minutes for the pizza. My stomach instantly hurt. Not crispy at all and just covered in grease. Not good at all."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service to go along with the excellent pies... we got a big guy pepperoni, cheese bread and the complimentary cinnamon poppers... outstanding!"}
{"text":"5 stars.

must try these 3:
the big sexy. 
white pie.
& the original cheesesteak is friggin incredible!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza and great service. If I lived in the area I would be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best home made pizza and sub sand witches you can get. We absolutely love this place. The meatballs and sauce are absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"Shared a small white pie and cheese steak w/onions & cheese whiz w/my bf for dinner last night. Both were deeeelish! I would highly recommend to try."}
{"text":"This place came up on yelp with decent reviews, but deserved a perfect 5 stars! We tried calling 6 other pizza places for delivery, but nobody could deliver! I'm soooo glad that we ordered from Those Guys Pies because the crust was so perfectly crispy and yummy! We ordered pepperoni and sausage and it so well done and perfect! Delivery was within 30 minutes and we couldn't have been happier with our pie! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza and Cheese Steaks in Vegas PERIOD, we go here every time we visit Vegas and it is always spot on, Great service and quality"}
{"text":"Great pie! 

I built my own 18\" with ghost pepper sauce (awesome) mozzarella, chicken, mushrooms and garlic. 

The only thing I can say that could be an opportunity for improvement is I asked for a \"well done\" crust but it wasn't quite there. 

Anyways, great pie, taste, ingredients, and cool delivery dude. I'll order again."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated. 

I've been looking forward to trying Those Guys because of all these good reviews. I had a \"buy 1, get 1\" coupon so I figured that was a bonus! 

The shop is small and hidden and the employees were friendly enough, but the pizza did not live up to the 4 stars it gets here on yelp. We ordered 2 pies: the \"Shroom\" and the \"Spicy Red Italian\". They were ready in about 20 minutes.

I always make sure I try a slice before I get home because a 15-20 minute drive can do terrible things to a pizza and I want an honest \"out of the oven\" opinion. We found a spot outside and opened the boxes only to find two very wet looking pies. I tried picking up a slice and it was so limp I basically ended up with a handful of toppings and grease. I had to fold it in half and even then, the tip had to be folded up into the middle of the slice. I ended up sucking out the ingredients like pizza soup.

Taste-wise, it wasn't too bad and the ingredients seemed fresh but the crust could not stand up to them. It was a very messy situation. If I hadn't had the 2 for 1 coupon I would have been really upset as those two pies would have run me about $45. Seriously? I've worked in a pizza shop before so I know pizza doesn't have to cost that much.

I seem to be in the minority here but I definitely won't be rushing back to Those Guys any time soon. There are much better options out there."}
{"text":"Awesome phillycheese steak sanwhiches!"}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was incredible! Will come back just for that. People complaining about service should just relax .. When a small place like this gets a rush, you're going to wait a bit longer .. Hope to try pizza soon"}
{"text":"This was an excellent last minute...Yelp choice. Once again not let down. Everything we ordered from salad, entree and meals were excellent. Nothing fast food about it. The staff was super nice and helpful. This is my first time in this area of the country. Everyone is just so nice.  We are here for days..I will definitely be back for another meal."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Tried to get a take out order and they had me on hold for over 3.5 minutes.   Saw this place on ddd n wanted to try it.  They lost a potential good customer."}
{"text":"Soooooooo Yummy!!!! 
We always order the Chicken fingers and fries lunch meal and it's delicious every time!! Not to mention the guys here are so friendly and nice! I would recommend TGP to everyone looking for delicious food and friendly fast service!"}
{"text":"Great food and crew!  Only three tables but def good for take out or uber eats. Crew were friendly and made eating there a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to stop and grab a pizza here,they were featured on Diners,Drive-ins & Dives,so I knew I had to try them.the pizza price was maybe a bit over priced,for the portion size however the flavor of it,makes it a bit even for the price. there's no restroom on site ,I believe you have to use the bathroom inside a bar next door and the dine in area is really small,also the staff is a bit more worried at the phone orders than those that come inn to eat. Well I recommend them? Yes and No,sorry ! Only reason for my answer is cause of the few things I saw while eating my pizza I hope management gets to read this and decides to maybe give it a lil makeover it may not hurt them,new tables maybe? A new painting? A floor cleaning? Enjoy your pizza ladies and gentlemen!!!"}
{"text":"This review stems from sampling their food from Bite of Las Vegas so take it for what it's worth.
They were sampling their buffalo chicken w/ jalapenos which was AMAZING! They had numerous others to sample, but didn't get a chance to have a bite. That sample def made me want to enjoy more of what they have to offer. If you haven't had their pizza you're missing out! 
The only bummer is that they don't deliver to the southwest side as their delivery radius is 5 miles."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. 
Bomb wings!
Waited an hour because they forgot to make our order and then gave us the wrong order at the end of the deal. I gave 4 stars because the food was pretty good mostly the wings!! Just check your order and sit inside so they don't forget you... 


**update** I really appreciate how awesome you guys were about everything. And I want to note that my review wasn't meant to be negative - the food was bomb. And the guys were super nice!! I am just very honest. We WILL go back and I gave 4 stars  :) 
Thank you for the feedback!"}
{"text":"Taste just like back home New York
And the service is awesome, took him only 10min to make that perfect pizza"}
{"text":"Took my Father-In Law here the night before Xmas Eve since he was from out of town and saw this on DDD.  Hole in the wall joint.. No sign on top of the restaurant.  Hard to find in the dark.  Ordered about $70 worth of food (Maui Wowie Pizza a few cheesteaks & fingers.  I even put a tip on the bill ahead of time.  Was told it would be about a 20-25 minute wait.  The front door was left open, which left the inside waiting area very cold.  There was another party that came in after us and was served their food shortly after ordering, which irritated me a bit.  We were not communicated with at all during our waiting time.  No \"sorry about the wait\" or \"your food will be done shortly\".... Instead, 42 minutes later, we were given our food, after asking for it.  Pizza was cold by the time we got home.  I didn't notice anything special about the pizza.  In my opinion it lacked toppings.  20-25 minutes vs. 42 minutes for an overpriced pizza ($26) and cheesesteaks ($12 each)?  I could have purchased almost 3 pizzas from Costco for the price of one pizza here.  Just wish we would have been acknowledged a bit while we visited and maybe have the associates smile once in a while.  We considered Capriotti's prior to coming here... Probably should have.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place in Vegas!

I love the BBQ chicken pizza, the chicken fingers are amazing, and Those a Guys are the only pizza place I've been to that actually makes their own mozzarella sticks. 

We ordered too much and saved our cheesesteaks for the next day. Baked in the oven and delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome food have to get the philly cheese steak and the Maui Hawaiian pizza love this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!Awesome service also!!!!!!! Hands down favorite philly in town"}
{"text":"Outstanding east coast style pizza and cheese steaks. Their delivery is pretty limited, but it's worth the drive. Cheese steaks are authentic, and the pizza is to die for. The specialty pizzas can get pretty expensive, but they have a ton of toppings and are worth it in my opinion. Try a cheese steak with the three cheese fries."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, multiple ingredients, can order conveniently online and they always get the food to you before the due time... it may cost a little more than other places, but I wouldn't go anywhere else for pizza!"}
{"text":"Just had the best east coast pizza since moving from South Jersey. I have lived in Vegas for 22 years and to put it mildly, the pizza in this town sucks. 

Big pizza joints on the strip, downtown, etc...close your doors. You can't hold a candle to what they produce at Those Guys Pies. 

Here's the story, if you are visiting from the east coast, get in a cab or drive yourself over to the Lakes and grab a pie. If you have never been to the east coast and want a delicious pizza, get to those guys. If you live here and have been dying for great pizza, look no further. I'm telling you this is the place. I live in henderson and will make the trek over and over again. 


You have been briefed. Dine accordingly."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since I left Jersey, 20 years ago, thin crust, nice and crispy, that price is very reasonable, and the owners from my hometown Cherry Hill New Jersey, where there is no bad Pizza"}
{"text":"I came to visit because of the TV show. Triple D, and i was not disappointed. The pizza was great, flavorful and the crust had the amount of crunch and consistency. Not a lot of space to sit, it's more of a carry out. A bit warm inside, yet well with the trip.
I am glad i can check that place off my list. I'd strongly consider coming back."}
{"text":"The only legit CheeseSteak Spot in Vegas.  Certified amoroso rolls , cheese wiz , provolone or American cheese choices"}
{"text":"I've been here a total of two times. Once because i couldn't decide on what to eat and just ordered it from home to pick up. Second time was way more recent, still couldn't decide on what to eat, and ordered it on yelp to pick up after i swung by my friends house to pick up something. 

Yelp/GrubHub or w/e the service is to order through yelp, had estimated it to be like 50-60 minutes before I get my order. I had originally called and wanted to cancel the order if the wait was that long because i was trying to swing by and get it on the way home. Whoever had picked up the phone had told me it was going to take like 15 minutes. Oh? Nice ! And off to the restaurant i went to pick up. 

This restaurant is located in northeast-ish side of 'The Lakes'. It's midly hidden even in the shopping center it is in. Since i was like 5 minutes away, i sat at the restaurant maybe 10 minutes before i got my pizza. Fairly on point with the estimation ! Thanks ! The restaurant itself is really small. Maybe room for i think like 2 tables and some chairs. Rest of it was the kitchen. 

So onto the food. Both times i had gotten the \"Italian White Pie\" that is listed under their 'Specialty House Pie' category. The Italian White Pie includes ricotta, mozzarella, broccoli rabe, sausage, garlic, and carmelized onions on a white pizza. What makes it a white pizza is not using the \"usual\" tomato sauce but a white cream sauce, probably similar to like an alfredo sauce. cream and cheese based. 

The first time i got the 'Italian White Pie', it was awkwardly mildly too salty. Which was surprising for a pizza. I decided to give it another try and this time, it was PERFECT ! Crust was nice and thin but crispy. Good amounts of ricotta and mozzarella which gave it a nice amount of creaminess and cheesiness. The sausage was thinly cut so you get more then a pebble worth on each slice. Carmelized onions add such a nice savoriness and sweetness overall. Next time something i'd change is EXTRA GARLIC ! yeah i just love garlic. why not have more garlic?! mmm hehe maybe the onions too. The broccoli rabe adds a nice green color and a \"crispness\" to it all aside from the crust, since everything else was nice and soft. 

The italian white pie is just so good, i dont know if i can try anything else. I just love everything about it ! Maybe if they can throw on some peppers to give it a nice spicy kick, then it would be 100%"}
{"text":"I had the \"Big Sexy\" pizza the other day and it was freakin awesome!!! A patient recommended i try it and they were on point!! Great ingredients!! I cant wait to have another!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. The Veggie pizza was delicious. Fresh ingredients, precise order, great service! I love NY style pizza and this definitely met my standards. I've been searching for a good local pizza place and this has become one of my new favorites."}
{"text":"Amazing.. The pizza is sooo good here. I would suggest the cheese pizza and the meat lover one but i'm sure all the food here is good."}
{"text":"Our daughter mentioned this place to us as her and husband frequent the strip mentioned the Cosmo connection etc etc. After phoning in the order, drove 5 minutes for pick-up. (It's a pick-up/delivery kinda place.) Super nice guy working, very pleasant. The storefront was very clean and our order was ready as promised. The counter guy said business was picking up, which is good for such an out of the way place.

We ordered the 'Big Sexy' pizza the cheesesteak with extra onions and the cinnamon poppers (spelled that way on the menu). I'll keep this short; the cheesesteak was super dry and hardly an onion was to be found and the roll was a couple of days old. The pizza was 'ok' the edge of the crust was good but the rest was greasy and soggy....way too thin is the problem. The sauce and meatball slices were good.
The poppers were ok for 5 bucks, kinda tough but ok. I make zeppoli at home and thought these would be just as tender. Not. 

For the money I'll stick to Rocco's or Metro as for the cheese steaks I'll drive cross town to Geri's or around the corner to Cappriotti's. I'm from South Philly which means nothing. Hey I'm not a chef but I know good food when I taste it. BTW I think charging $0.75 for a few pepperoncini's on the side is tacky

Bottom line, the service was really good and the food....Meh."}
{"text":"I've lived nearby for a while now and recently decided I need to try this place out - did an online order for delivery and it was almost a true success. I ordered the mozzarella sticks to try - not the best but not terrible, a Chicken Cesar Salad which for $10 because of the chicken my biggest disappointment was I felt it was overpriced for what it truly was. Everyone makes their Cesar a little different but if this one had less lettuce and more oomph I would have enjoyed it more. Add on some tomato slices or shredded cheese, again it needs more oomph and less lettuce I literally felt like I paid $10 for a box full of lettuce and a piece of chicken sliced up. Last I ordered the cheesecake as I read here on yelp that it is apparently amazing but unfortunately they were \"all out\" according to my delivery lady, she did however refund me for the missing dessert and offer me a free cannoli and as I appreciated the respect they have for their customers when they can't fulfill an order - I gave that money right back to her as a tip to say thank you."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  Absolutely no complaints, except maybe that I wish I could have fit more slices in my tummy!  Thanks GUYS!"}
{"text":"This is the second location of the famed Those Guys Pies which is located in the Hideaway Bar and Grill. It has taken over the short-lived 'Noble Intentions' restaurant. They have been here for about a month and have not advertised yet, but they are open.

I actually came to the Hideaway to check out Noble Intentions. I was really surprised to see that Those Guys Pies were there. I guess I didn't miss much at Noble Intentions since they opened for only a couple of months. Lucky for me, I had the original location of Those Guys Pies bookmarked for the longest time, so I was able to kinda check off that bookmark, I think.

For those who don't know the story of Those Guys Pies, they were opened by some of the original partners of Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. They branched off and did their own thing, building a place in the Lakes area of Vegas and became very successful, even being featured in Guy Fieri's Diner's Drive-In's and Dives.

After finding out, I had to try the White Pie, which was one of my favorite slices at Secret. The food came out and I couldn't be happier!

White Pie (Sauce less, Ricotta, Mozzarella, Garlic) - Just like how I remembered it, but better. Great quality cheeses, and the garlic flavor popped. Those guys pies do a version of NY style pizza, and they do it well. Crispy, crusty, and chewy all at the same time. I can't think of anything negative to say, it was just a fantastic pizza.

There aren't a lot of quality dining options around this area, so I'm glad that Those Guys Pies has opened up. Also, this would be a great place to grab some food at Those Guys Pies, as well as a beverage from the Hideaway while you watch your sports team in action. Their POS system isn't set up by the time I'm writing this review, but it should be available soon. If you need to use a credit card, you can pay at the bar until it is set up. The people next to me had ordered a sub and sandwich, and it looked really good, I might have to check that out next time."}
{"text":"The pizza is great but the buffalo chicken sandwich leaves much to be desired. A huge sandwich with a fourth of the bread not filled. Bland and flavorless buffalo chicken sandwich with not much flavor from the buffalo or the ranch. But again their pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"Seriously such good pizza, and I should know, I'm from the east coast (I know it's the worst when people say stuff like that but with pizza it's just true). Their roasted tomatoes are my favorite topping they offer!"}
{"text":"After two failed attempts at ordering delivery from two other nearby pizza locations on a a Sunday night, we can across this place. We ordered a large pepperoni, onion and jalapeños pizza. We also received free cinnamon poppers for checking in on yelp. We were told it would be 30-40 minutes to arrive, but it actually came about 50 minutes later. The pizza was huge! I was impressed with how good it was although the total was 25$, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I decided to try a new pizza spot tonight after perusing my Entertainment book.

We ordered an 18\" white pizza, and an 18\" meat lovers pizza. I was impressed they had artichokes - so I asked if our pizza can have artichokes instead of bacon. They said cool, so I was very happy about the easiness of substituting one item.

We get home, and we find out that we received 2 of the White Pizzas. I LOVE white pizza - my kids despise it. I usually take a peek at the pies before bringing them home, but I failed to do so this time.

I made a phone call to Those Guys. Unfortunately, I live 15-20 minutes away and was not going to drive back to show them the pizzas. I tried explaining we have 2 of the same pizzas - I am looking right at them. I tasted a slice from each. They look the same, taste the same - and the person on the phone insists I have 2 different pizzas. 

Being a 42 year old Long Island born and raised boy, I kinda know my way around pizza. I promise if a pizza had pepperoni or artichokes on it, I would know it even if I was blind.

I am ok with the Pizza. I would give the pizza 3 1/2 stars of 5. I can appreciate that the pizza tastes like a decent pie. It is middle of the road for quality. When a pizza is wrong, I have no choice but to deduct points. When I am told I have the correct pizza in front of me and it is not, I have to deduct for that also.

I took pictures of both pizzas, and if I can figure out how to add them to this review, they will shown here in just a bit. If someone can find the pepperoni and artichokes and show me that the broccoli rabe is not broccoli rabe, that would be most helpful."}
{"text":"Delicious cheese steak, can't wait to try the pizza and wings next time. Will definitely be back, glad to know they deliver as well. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Took trip across town to see how it was !! The cheese steak was incredible!! Made  with Ribeye, provolone, mushrooms, grilled onions and peppers!! It was really tasty with the  right amount of everything and the hoagie bread was perfect!! 

W also ordered The Big Sexy pizza !! Although it was not very sexy it was very yummy!! Wished the crust was a little crispier but had the right amount heat and it was delicious ..... Would be nice to see them get a bigger place and it was very hot inside so we ordered ours to go !!

We would defiantly come back !! Only four stars for the heat and smallness of the building !!"}
{"text":"My roommate introduced me to this great place, it is a simple pizza shop with great food! Even though it's a pizza shop definitely try the cheesesteak it's awesome. Also, there sausage is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Pizza delivery fella was really nice. 
Ordering was super easy. I was in a house full of littles that were loud so doing it online was handy. 
The pizza was ok. I've had better, but I've had worse.
I had the bbq chicken. I liked the caramelized onions on it. Pepperoni pizza was ok."}
{"text":"This place only has seating for about 10 people total and is really cramped, so don't plan on dining in."}
{"text":"After deliberating all morning about where we all wanted to eat. We decided to give this place a try, since we've seen this place on diners drive-ins and dives. We ordered two 14\" pizzas, one was The Greek, the other was The Italian White Pie. We also ordered The Works Cheese Steak, that we had cut into fours, and Fried Mushrooms. The Greek was the best out of the two pies we ordered, because the sauce and toppings all worked well together. However the Italian White pie was just not to our taste. The garlic & sautéed onion was just too strong tasting for us. The Works Cheese Steak was very tasty. The ribeye was of good quality, but it could use a little more cheese on top. That said, it's still the best I've ever eaten. The fried mushrooms were cooked just right and piping hot, with a sauce called TGP which was nice and slightly spicy. We've all agreed to come back here and try the BBQ Maui Wowie pie."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and I am glad to give it to Those Guys Pies.

I was looking to try something new than your standard pizza chains, so I searched Yelp.  The first place that appeared was Those Guys Pies.  So I read some reviews, looked at the menu, and decided to try them.  I was not let down!

I ordered the \"Big Pie\" Meat Pie, which was excellent!  The meatballs are sliced in a way that makes the meatball slices bigger than most places Pepperoni.  Not only that, but they taste great as well.  The bacon was tasty and not \"fatty\" like regular bacon can be.  And for the size of the pizza, it was worth the price!

I also ordered a \"Regular Pie\" custom because they have a pizza sauce that I had to try: Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce.  First off, the Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce is awesome!  It gives a nice burn without overpowering the pizza taste.  I added meatballs, pepperoni, and broccoli rabe to this pizza, to go with the sauce.  Everything went well with the ingredients.  If I have one issue with this pizza, is that it could have used a bit more sauce (only because I loved the sauce).

Their cheesesteak (which I ordered with ribeye, onions and white american cheese) is one of the better cheesesteaks I have had.  Very tasty with the right amount of cheese and meat.  The bread was soft in the middle and has a nice crust, without the hardness that is found on the ends of a lot of french bread.

I also tried the 3 cheese fries, which was interesting because of the cheeses used.  I'm not sure which cheeses were on it, but I'm guessing it was whiz, mozzarella, and cheddar?  Even still, the fries were tasty and filling...a meal unto itself!

The price is a bit higher than standard pizza chains, but for the quality of the pizza, the cheesesteaks and the ingredients, it is well worth the money.  Plus, the one dollar delivery fee was a plus!   I can definitely recommend Those Guys Pies, and will order again soon!

Oh, and to Those Guys Pies...do NOT get rid of the Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce!  That stuff is so delicious!!"}
{"text":"'Those Guys Pies' is absolutely AMAZING!  Everything is GREAT and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. ***AS GOOD AS IT GETS!***"}
{"text":"After watching Tripple D, I thought it was time to give it a try. Unfortunately this place is a train wreck.  It has very limited seating, no where to wait, except outside; not enough staff and painfully slow service. Over 15 minutes to get a cheesesteak and I am still waiting as I write this.  The only TV plays their episode of Diners Dives and Drive-ins on a constant loop. Guy makes this place seem like is a destination, but if your in a hurry fget about it.

Now a half hour later, I have memorized the entire episode word for word, late for work and sadly dissaopointed.

I am from Philly and will say that the cheese steak is just okay; I have had better...if your from the east coast then you know.  Their pizzas seem like a hit, but I don't have time to find out."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Philly cheese steaks! Made with Rib Eye, they are Perfect! The Pizza is really good to. They did cancel the promo for the free cinnamon poppers though."}
{"text":"Not a huge east coast pizza fan, the Chicagoan in me is very bias...I blame that. 
However, we've had it twice and it's always good. 
No complaints here, haven't tried the cheese steak yet, but maybe next week! 
Would recommend!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

The cheesesteaks here are almost good enough to say Pop's who? Almost. The meat is quality and they aren't shy with it. Using cheese whiz never hurt anybody either! I recommend trying the cheesesteak before anything else. I still need to try a pizza that is more my style with sausage and peppers but my wife ordered a white pie that I gave into and tried a slice of. It wasn't bad, just not my personal favorite toppings for a pizza. The crust on it was good. The mozzarella sticks are made fresh and by hand to order. They have a good amount of gooey cheese and cooked perfectly. My 2nd visit I also tried the 3 cheese fires which looked much better than they sounded and tasted. The fries were cooked right but I would just want cheese whiz on them next time and not the other cheeses. I do wish they had better signage out front. I had a bit of a time finding it and at this time anyway there is nothing on the building saying who they are like the neighboring business in the center. I noticed the specials on their window is the only reason I found it. Solid place with great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Uh-oh. This has been our go-to pizza place for several years. The pizzas were always delivered hot and delicious. However, our past two orders have been cold--as in the crust was hard cold, as was our buffalo chicken sandwich tonight. A month or so ago we ordered in at work, and all of those pizzas were also cold. I am so disappointed. Not sure what has happened, as we have been faithful customers for a long time."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken pizza was amazing. The mascarpone cheesecake super delicious. I have to come back and try a cheesesteak. 
Negatives no seating there are two table outside next to lake which is pretty cool once the sun goes down."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good.  Highly recommend you try this place.  The service was excellent and the food was amazing. We had the cheese steak pizza and the big sexy pizza.  Also had cheese bread and chicken wings. Well worth the drive to find this place. Saw it on triple D and decided to try it out. I'm glad we did. Only problem is that there are only two tables in the place, not meant for larger groups.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Best pie in Las Vegas! I mean real pizza like they have in the NYC area. And it's not just the pizza. Wings, fries, all of it. Hardest thing is trying to pick!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town; they treat customers right. The buffalo chicken pizza is so tasty! Really tho, can't go wrong, tried several of their pizzas they are all great!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a huge cheese steak fan, but these cheese steaks are LEGIT! The meat is good quality and full of flavor. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, thought the price was decent for the amount of yummy all on one plate! I ordered the cheesesteak sandwich and fries it was huge, enough food for my husband and I to share. We will def be returning and exploring more of the menu"}
{"text":"TGP is perfect for those evenings when nothing sounds good and I don't want to cook. I like the  buffalo-garlic parm and spicy barbecue wings (or strips!) with bleu cheese or an Italian cheese steak, add mushrooms.

Staff is friendly, shop is messy and lacks ambiance but the cook throws his heart and soul into the food. The chicken strips are good sized, long and skinny and crispy- but all the sauces are off the chain! Buffalo garlic parm is the favorite, but spicy barbeque is tasty as well. Bleu cheese dressing is fresh made in-house with chunks of actual cheese.

That Italian Cheese Steak has plentiful rib eye, peppers, and onions, topped with high quality melted provolone and a good amount of mushrooms (for a minor surcharge). Bread is good and though a bit soggy, held up without falling apart.

This a regular pick-up stop during football season. The pizza is pretty solid, but as detailed above, I actually prefer their other menu offerings."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  We are super picky about Pizza and this place is nothing but excellent!  We ordered a large pizza and wings and the entire meal was delicious!  Fresh ingredients, and the owners (and staff) were very friendly!  Should have taken a photo but couldn't wait to eat!  Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Not happy after waiting the 40mims for a pizza that i did not order arrives. I spoke with the man and stated i wanted mozzarella cheese, spinach, and tomatoes he then asked if i wanted to add basil i said yes and i wanted to add hot wings i got a pizza with no spinach n it tasted like a can of tomato sauce n the wings were dry and salty. i had to apply my own sauce and of course they only gave a small container. First time and last time ordering from here. I thought with all the reviews being positive it may be a one shooter but im not willing to spend another $27 for pizza n wings that taste nasty. Oh n i gv them to a homeless person maybe he'll enjoy it"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Vegas. It is greasy but what do you expect, it's pizza. 

I once ordered one that had the broccoli rabe (Italian white pizza) and the earthy taste of the veggie was too strong- didn't blend well at all with the pizza. 

Now I always get white shroom and I'm happy with it. I like the regular white pizza too.

What I don't like is the attitude of Roy the owner who took my order. Not everyone working there acts like him- the rest are friendly and polite. I told him about my house salad soaked in dressing and I was unable to eat it and he didn't do anything about it except said he will put my dressing on the side the next time.

For me it's 4 stars if it weren't for the attitude."}
{"text":"After seeing them on Diners Driveins and Dives, we drove out of our way for the Cheesesteaks.   Very yummy, but wouldn't call it the best I've ever had.  We'll try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"I write this with a saddened heart. This used to be my go to pizza place however after today if I could give them negative stars I would. We ordered online for our office. Mistake number 1. Apparently if you order before they open they app pushes it to the next day. So we call and when speaking to the females the manager persists to call us young ladies in a condescending matter and argue with us when we try to find out where our food is.  If your website is crap maybe fix it. He even called one of the people back to continue argue how he is right and she is wrong. Try to learn customer service. This is not how business is done. If there is an issue on your end don't blame the customer do not get nasty and do not be condescending. Their food isn't good enough to deal with such crappy service. Will be looking for my east coast pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Comparable to but better than Metro Pizza. Good steak sandwich but a little over priced. There isn't any dine-in available yet but they may open another one soon..."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in Vegas! And I'm from buffalo where it all started! Hand breaded chicken - cooked to order. Most places use frozen chicken- not here! I highly recommend the fingers and the pizza is great also!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because I was craving pizza and found this place on yelp. I got the Big Pie (large size) half Big Sexy and half White Pie. The \"Big Sexy\" comes with sausage, pepperoni, garlic, onion and pepperoncini. The \"White Pie\" comes with ricotta, mozzarella and garlic. 

I enjoyed the pizza a lot. The slices are huge which makes the very tip of them flimsy when you hold it by the crust and try eating it. The crust was great. My girlfriend loved the White Pie and we would both order from here again.

Our Big Pie with half Big Sexy and half White Pie came out to $23.50."}
{"text":"We used to order from Those Guys before their recent price increase. We decided to give them another go before this Packers game this weekend and we confirmed that we will never order from this establishment again. We ordered at 1:20 in the afternoon and the follow up email saying our order will be ready by 2:08. At 2:45 we call Those Guys to cancel the order and the guy I speak to on the phone tries to guilt me into not cancelling because his \"drive is like a block away\" -- keep in mind, I live 10 minute from Those Guys. When I don't give in and tell him to keep the order, he literally hangs up on me. I call back to speak to a manager and apparently, the man I was speaking to was the owner. Totally unacceptable customer service for an order that hadn't arrived 40 minutes AFTER the original 48 minute wait time."}
{"text":"For quality and service Those Guys Pies thumbs up. Eventhough they donot sell mozzarella sticks when we mentioned it the owner went out of his way to make them. We ordered the 18in pinnapple bacon and half pepperoni sausage and pepperchini its was excellant. Its also close to the house and they deliver."}
{"text":"Worst pie in 83 years & worst Cheesesteak. I'm from Jersey near Philly & I know good pizza"}
{"text":"The cheesesteak was outstanding. Tons of fresh quality meat. It melted in my mouth. 

The red Italian pizza was absolutely amazing. Having the sausage sliced thin and fresh tomatoes on top of it all made this a spectacular pizza. Tons of flavor. Perfect balance of spice"}
{"text":"I ordered the white pie!! Ooooohhh boy!!! It's sooo goood!!! Loved that garlicy taste and ricotta cheese!! It's the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza I picked up yesterday, best pizza I have had in Vegas. The bacon is SO good, I will definitely be seeing you more often!! Thanks for the great pie"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in town.  I am a pizza snob and I can't get enough of these pies.  If you like a true NY style pizza, look no further.  I travel 25 minutes away to grab this delicious pizza. I think the white pizza is da bomb!  The wings are pretty good.  They have great unique sauces for everyone's taste buds. The chicken fingers are really good too. If you like fresh chicken fingers these are great!  I really like Canes, but I think TGP have two stars ahead of them.  

Now let's talk about the cheesesteak.  Yep these guys serve cheese steaks.  First of all I am not a cheesteak fan.  I was told every time I went to grab a pie to try the cheesesteak.  OMG....they made me a believer.  Get the cheesesteak and a PIE and you are good to go!  

Those Guys Pies are in my humble opinion the BEST in knowing how to combine sauces, fresh high grade cheese and toppings, and the bombiest crust known to man into what most call pizza.....and for those you know pizza.......call pie!!!!  

7  stars if yelp would let me...."}
{"text":"Well where to start this is one of the best pizzas I've ever had I'm a kid from South Jersey and I know pizza so if you need a great slice of pie!!!! You  need to go to those guys pies it's the best pizza in Las Vegas I'll did I mention the cheesecake off the hook

THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly excellent pizza.    And the cheesesteaks
Freaking Rock, too!     The fries remind me of fries I had on the beach as a kid back east.    And the chicken fingers--  real chicken fingers.   What can I say?  Everything I have had here is f##king excellent."}
{"text":"Their pizza is some of the very best we have ever had! It's a drive for us, but well worth it! A tiny place with maybe two tables so order to go. They make amazing thin crust, New York style pizza. Hope they will open some more locations. A def 5 star!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good Philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Food is good. The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because it's so, so dirty in there. The front at least should be scrubbed and spruced up even if anyone eating in there is a rarity."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for the Super Bowl and it came burnt:(  since I ordered through postmates they refused to send out another pizza.  I emailed postmates and they basically said we're sorry about your loss and we will do our best to not let that happen again.  So I'm stuck paying for a rubbery hard nasty looking pizza.  Bad business.  The pizza came looking like it sat for a long time.  Cold and nasty."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Saw this restaurant on Dinners, drive-in, and fives. Placed order online. Both the casher and the cook was confused by my order.  Pizza was not worth the 30 minute drive. I could be a snob being that I am from Philly where we have the best Italian food."}
{"text":"Went here the first time with colleagues from work. We had the Maui Wowie? I believe is what it was called. It was delicious! There is not a ton of seating here so if there are an average number of people there eating lunch you will have to look elsewhere or order to go. Would definitely love to try it again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Had their pizza for the first time tonight, Omg amazing.  I had been to the raw vegan place next door once, (which, hey, I'm not a vegan, but can appreciate the food) and the whole time i was wishing I was at the pizza shop! We got 1/2 italian white and 1/2 red with meatball and ricotta.  both were out of this world.  My hubby ran into grab it, but it seemed like its not an actual restaurant but takeout only."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza joint. Delicious food and friendly staff. We ordered half pepperoni half shroom white 18\" pizza. We will come back again."}
{"text":"So I ended up trying this place because I had a HORRIBLE experience at PAPA JOHNS. So glad I did! Customer service was amazing after having been spoken down to by numerous PJ employees it was nice to turn around to folks who were super nice and accommodating! Pizza was great and it's right around the corner! Def found my new pizza spot!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place mainly because these guys take their pies very seriously. I love their white pie, but truly cant be disapointed with any pizza on the menu. This is the best pizza place for take out outside the strip. The owner is a very passionate man who appreciates a good quality product everytime."}
{"text":"I don't see myself ordering Dominos anytime soon after trying this place. It's similar to Villa Pizza, and the cheesy bread was really good too. Delivery was pretty fast as well."}
{"text":"Only had the Philly Steak but it was definitely on point. Not overly cheesed, full of tender, shredded cooked to perfection prime rib with the right amount of onions on soft, delicious bread. Well worth in filling the $11 price tag!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Vegas. I am from New York so I can appreciate a good quality ny style pizza. What makes them different from the rest is that a lot of their toppings are house made. I am unfortunately sensitive to dairy but I will still cheat sometimes when my boyfriend orders from here. They never skimp toppings and their cheesesteaks are always filled and smothered in cheese wiz if you ask for it that way. I love their shroom pizza on white cheese. It is so good!! Support this local business! They know wtf they're doing."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:43pm on a Sunday and they wouldn't take our order. If you are open until 10, you should. E working until 10, not 9:30. Drove 25 mins from the strip to be disappointed... Thanks for ruining our night!"}
{"text":"I'm a very indecisive person when it comes to eating pizza at a new joint but this past Friday morning, this came up in our suggestions for pizza, right around lunch time. They told us to go here for New York style pizza. And we were just like ok yeah right, we are hungry let's just get some pizza. We ordered on the phone and a few minutes later it was ready for pick up. Throughout the whole ride back to work I couldn't stop thinking if we made the right choice, I mean this pizza has ought to be good because we were feeding a lot of workers. And then the moment of truth came we opened the boxes and boom BAM! We were impressed, I liked the quality and taste of this pizza! Especially the diablo style pizza, it was the first time I could almost finish the entire regular box by myself. I will definitely come back, and I look forward too. And you know what's even better? The customer service. I forgot to request a receipt upon my arrival and I called back and asked if I could obtain a copy, very politely they managed to send me a copy to my email. There you go, great pizza + good customer service it's on my A list."}
{"text":"Came to check out place after watching Triple D.  Pizza was good.  But to be fair, just had pepperoni. Guy who took my order was in no mood to be there. Listen, I don't want you to roll out red carpet, but at least be pleasant and say a couple of words. Place was hot. The cinnamon dough rolls were spectacular.  Don't leave there without trying them. Next time back in Vegas, I'll give the sandwiches a GO. 

Thanks Roy. See you next time.  Still thinking about those cinnamon dough rolls!!"}
{"text":"Ok. Where do I start? With the oh-my-god-these-are-the-best-chicken-fingers-I've-ever-had-in-my-mouth? With their amazingly delicious Italian breadcrumb coating deep fried to perfection? But, wait! There's more. The sauces...IPA buffalo? Pineapple buffalo? Garlic Parmesan? The best fingers hands down, anywhere. I just can't imagine anyone making them any better. 
I was going to save the pizza review for last because I thought it was the best thing on the menu. But, after tonight's surprise cheesesteak, I'm torn. The pizza, for us, was the main draw. It's virtually perfect. The crust is thin, crispy but with that little bit of chew. The toppings are unlike any other pizza joint...they house make the bacon, the sausage & the meatball. HOUSEMADE  PEOPLE, HOUSE MADE! An Italian white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta & broccoli rabe, who else is making a takeout/delivery pizza at that caliber? It's takeout pizza on a whole other level. 
Now, on to the cheesesteak. We're west coast people, born & raised in San Diego and  we just never quite got the craze for cheesesteak. It's good, but we've never been wowed. Well, last night we were sent home from Those Guys Pies with an original cheesesteak. Ribeye. Onions. American Cheese. Cheesewhiz. It blew us away. It was perfection. It wasn't just a cheesesteak, it was an experience! The reason we weren't \"cheesesteak people\" is because we had never had a real cheesesteak done right. Now, we can't wait til our next cheesesteak, but only from TGP!  

There you have it. People, you need to get to Those Guys Pies and try everything. Those guys know more than just perfect pizzas!! Happy Eating!!"}
{"text":"We called in an order for delivery - spinach salad and white pie. Phone service was excellent and delivery service was great.  The best part of the experience was the food! Every single bite was amazing! We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is traditional NY style pizza with lots of flavor and a million different combinations to try. The chicken fingers are not your typical fingers...they're REAL chicken, cut, breaded and fried from scratch. Delicious! Actually, as far as I can tell, EVERYTHING is made from scratch. The cheesesteaks are amazing too!

Each time I've gone in, the owner and any other staff members there have been great. Typical New York attitude, but it's all with love. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wow what a place I ordered my pizza, chicken, and salad about an hour and twenty minutes before it came but I wasn't too upset because he said it would be about an hour for whatever reason but when they showed up they told us the 20 minute late delay was because they burnt our pizza and decided to give us the next size up and made our whole order FREE. Enough said right there... If you guys ever read these just know the kid off Belmont Lake appreciates you and looks forward to future business!"}
{"text":"Small place, only 3 tables in the location. The pizzas are very good ...with that east coast crust (meat pie ...really good). The philly cheese steak was good ...but not like the original philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"Had bad customer service. Got a big order and drove across town to pick it up. It was missing items and I didn't notice until I got home. I called and asked them to deliver what they had forgotten and they said they could not. They told me they would refund the items to my card \"in 3-5 business days.\" Stupid. There are a lot of good pizza places in LV. Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"When we first saw this restaurant on Guy Fieri, we had to run right over and get some! Those Guys has been one of our favorite places for over a year. However, the last 2 times we ordered, the food was lousy! All we can think of is it must be under new ownership now? Something is wrong, it's definitely not like it once was. The food quality has gone downhill. Today, my husband dropped over $60 on a meal for the family. Both pizzas sucked, very disappointing! Underneath the crust was caked with flour, it had dried out crust and barely any sauce, and both pizza tops were way overcooked, they were burnt! No one could even eat it. We also ordered 2 philly cheesesteaks, another total disappointment! There was hardly any meat and toppings like it used to be. And finally, the girl working the register had a rotten attitide. It was once a pleasure to run in and get our order. Must be under new ownership? Definitely not the same.  We have purchased our last meal from Those Guys, which was previously a family favorite. We will not be returning following 2 disappointments in a row."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch and had it delivered.. not only did we ask for a pizza with half sausage, the pizza that was delivered looked like a mess and had sausage on the whole pizza.. The philly was plain disgusting and the chicken fingers looked like it had mold.. you be the judge.."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here. The 1st time was 2 years ago. Now I live in Chicago so when I travel I love to try new places. I always opt for the cheese steak but I've also tried their pizza. I found out recently that they are going to be featured on Diners, Dives and Drive Ins! I've totally set my DVR to tape it! They are located in The Lakes neighborhood which is 15-20 minutes from the strip but worth the drive! Chicken fingers, wings too! Lunch specials too! You can eat outside next to lake!"}
{"text":"Amazing all around! Get the meat pizza!! So good! Tons of meat in every bite. Chicken fingers waa awesome! So much chicken and little crust! Exactly how it should be done! 
Philly cheese steak... to die for! Literally melts in your mouth! Man, in heaven!!

Customer service was above and beyond! We came in 945 and they were about to be closed according to their hours. The owner was super friendly and we got cinnamon poppers for free when u spend $25 or more and check in on Yelp! Definitely a must if you're in Vegas.  Hidden in a residential area, but such a gem!! Don't expect restaurant seating since it's more of a take out spot. Great for any occasion. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious philly sandwiches and fries. Stopped by for lunch. Will definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"Coworker and I wanted to grab a pizza from somewhere we hadn't been before for national pizza day.  My coworker had mentioned Those Guys Pies and we decided to give it a try as it was somewhat close to our office.  Picked up a pepperoni and ricotta pizza with ghost pepper pizza sauce.  Pizza was fantastic!  I'm a fan of spicy sauces and the combination of heat/flavor of the ghost pepper sauce was nearly perfect.  I will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Had heard their pizza was good here so was hoping to find out myself.   I recently got the new Entertainment coupon book and it had a 2 for 1 coupon in it which inspired me to drive about 15 miles for dinner.   When arriving here, I was told at the counter they were no longer accepting these coupons.   Seems like fraudulent marketing to me and I wasn't going to give them a chance after that experience.   Very disappointed in the attitude displayed and I'll take my business to pizza places that treat a customer right."}
{"text":"I just ordered the Shroom with Red sauce and the maple marscapone  cheesecake. So good! Those Guys, I love recommending you! Muah!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for over a year, now they don't deliver to my area anymore??? WTF. But I still get advertisements and coupons in my mailbox. #LAME. I'll just take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"In honor of Villanova winning the national championship I decided to celebrate the Philly spirit by trying Those Guys Pies. It was excellent! That was one amazing Philly cheesesteak and the pizza was yummy!"}
{"text":"The Best Pizza west of NY.  The staff (not sure if the owner took our order, but he seemed authoritative) was very attentive.  We ordered a half Shroom and half Spicy Italian pie with a side of wings (with the Wasabi Ranch and Garlic Parm dipping sauces).  Due to the limited seating, he suggested that we sit by the lake, which had a great view.  Once we received our order, we dug right in.  The first bite was so yummy and full of gooey cheesy mushroom goodness.  The wings were nice and crispy.  We both enjoyed the Wasabi Ranch very much; the ranch actually made for an excellent dip for the pizza crust as well.  After we downed a bottle of Coke, we went back to the pizza place and thanked them for a great meal.

Also, I don't understand how a pizza this good can be made in 10 minutes.  Much lesser establishments take far longer, cost just as much and don't have that very NY east coast freshly made-gooey-oily flavor that Those Guys offer up.  

**This review was written by my gf, who was raised on a steady diet of east coast pies growing up."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from the food network and they have been my go to place to order pizza from lately.  Really good \"speciality pies\" especially the Maui Wowie, which is there own take on a hawaiian pizza.  I only gave this place a 4 because the pizza is really good, but the wings and salads etc are just fair.  But if you stick to the pizza you are in good shape."}
{"text":"Small and Cozy Place. Super customer service and great food."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. 
But, if I were to do it again, I would order a large pizza, put it in the fridge for 2 hours, and heat up individual slices on aluminum foil (or a pizza stone) for 5 minutes at 475*F. Something magical happens. Sounds crazy, but I actually enjoy Those Guys Pies twice as much on the reheat. It becomes perfectly crispy and chewy, as real pizza should be.

Not all pizza reacts this way. But real NJ/NY pizza does. (This is meant to be a compliment to Those Guys Pies.)

Give it try. Experience the alchemy."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you only find of you know the secret handshake. But, now with yelp, anyone can enjoy. 

Its got a great location because there's a man-made lake just around the corner. Yes, a lake...in Vegas. Water instantly adds a feeling of serenity when large bodies of it are near. 

The portions are stellar and the scent of Italian spices, roasted tomatoes, and fresh dough are what will fill your olfactory nerves when you open the door. As if the nearby lake isn't a soothing sensation enough, the Parisian scents of pasta and pizza will hit you like a Rocky 1-2 combo...but, in a good way."}
{"text":"Made a mistake and reviewed the wrong pizza shop. I do plan on enjoying a cheese steak from here eventually, seen you guys on diner drive in and dines and it looks amazing. Sorry about the mistake, the company seems to be a great one from what Ive heard."}
{"text":"The food always tastes GREAT! And the owner and the staffs are always friendly!  Make sure try both their pizza and subs!"}
{"text":"Amazing. So amazing we went twice in the week we were there.  Hidden gem which is a short drive from the strip.  The interior of the shop is cozy with only a few tables.  Its mostly kitchen, but since he makes all his sauces in house I didn't mind at all.  The first trip we ordered the BBQ Maui Wowie pizza, that was featured on diners, drive-ins, and dives with Guy Fieri. My wife ordered the chicken Parm Sandwich.  Everything was made to order from the stretching of the dough, to the hand cut and breaded chicken.  We engaged in a great conversation with the co-owner Roy, and got to hear about his culinary ladder he climbed and how started Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, to where he is today being his own boss.  Amazing guy.

It didn't take long for our food to arrive. Both our pizza and sandwich were piping hot out of the oven.  Upon first bite of the pizza, it was like a flavor explosion with the 50/50 tangy BBQ/pizza sauce, the little heat from the pickled jalapeno, the sweet of the pineapple, and the savory of the pulled pork, and the saltiness from the bacon. MMMMM, it is what pizza dreams are made of.  Her sandwich was amazing as well with the toasted sub roll, pizza sauce, and melty cheese.  The chicken itself was very tasty due the amazing breading.

The second time, she got the chicken parm again, but I got the original cheesesteak with onions, and white american.  The cheesesteak was one of the best i've had with great seasoned meat and the toasted roll. And her chicken parm was amazing again.

We will definitely be back the next time we are in town. Thanks to Roy and his crew for the awesome stories, and the amazing food."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza, please pay attention to the reviews, we didn't and wasted $42 bucks. We walked in and specifically said half \"Big Sexy and Half bacon & pineapple (can't remember the name) what we got was half bacon & pineapple & half white pie. How do you screw this up? We also ordered fingers & wings, nasty too. Won't be back and I just want to erase the memory."}
{"text":"This is the place! I love secert pizza and now he's on my side of town! I love when things go my way! ;) Thanks to Traci T for the alert on this place! 

Their veggie pizza is so good, I think we got a white veggie too and both versions are great! Their white pizza is awesome! Yum! Yum! I can't wait to try the desserts everyone raves about but it doesn't go my way when I try to order as everyone else knows to snatch them up before they are all sold out. 

It is a small old school pizza joint, a counter to order at, a couple chairs to wait, and some pop coolers. Not a dine in place! I love it! Just like the places back home. 

My mouth is watering....I think I know what we'll have for dinner tonight! :)"}
{"text":"Had a philly cheese steak for dinner tonight, first time I've ordered from them, and honestly it was the best Philly cheesesteak i have ever had. It was delicious from the very first bite. The flavor of the prime rib they used was amazing. I will be a steady customer from now on."}
{"text":"This is no corporate cardboard crust flimsy topping kinda pie.   This is for the pure foodie and someone who  isn't afraid to eat.   The 18\" large pie will easy feed 3 grown people.    Everything on this menu is delicious.   You want to eat in? Sure just make sure you clear off a place to sit down and eat.   Delivery is fast, atmosphere is great and if you call and order the same thing more than once, just Say \"delivery what I got last time.\"   Magic word is  C-A-S-H.   It's a pizza for those who know pizza."}
{"text":"Delivery wait times are always very long (45 minutes to an hour); generally (99% of the time) they arrive later than promised.  If you order for pick-up, your wait time is around 25 minutes.  Despite the delivery snafus, we keep ordering from them because their pizza is great, their cheese sticks are pretty good, and their chicken wings and chicken tenders are the bomb.com!  The wings are always perfectly cooked (even after waiting forever for delivery!) and the tenders remind me of the tenders at Strip n Dip.  They have a large selection of sauces for their chicken; our favorite is the thai peanut... YUM!

They make/cure their own meats and I don't really have a taste for them, but they are high quality and flavorful.  I'm more of a cheese or pepperoni pizza fan, myself.  Their dough is thin, but the crust is just the right amount of thickness- so chewy!  

The prices are slightly higher than your average pizza joint, but quite frankly, their food is the best delivery option out there for pizza and wings- everywhere else is not worth the price or calories.  Their fried cinnamon poppers are pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"JFC this place is good. Pizzas are top notch. I like the big sexy personally, spicy and delicious. Cheesesteak is awesome too, but really, once you've tried the pies you probably won't ever order anything else there again. Do yourself a favor and stop by the next time you're in the mood for an excellent pizza"}
{"text":"My company ordered some pizzas from Those Guys Pies after hearing about it through some friends.  The pizza was delivered on time and still hot which was a great start.  I love NY style thin crust pizza so I was excited to try this!

We had 3 different specialty pies delivered so there were some options to try.  We had the White Pie, Meat Pie, and the Maui Wowie.  All the slices I tried were delicious and flavorful.  I especially liked the White Pie with the ricotta and garlic on it.  They also included some red chili flakes, parmesan cheese, oregano, and garlic powder in small containers with was an excellent touch and made the pizza taste that much better.

I would definitely order from Those Guys Pies again and get a White Pie and maybe try something new.  Their chicken fingers look awesome with all the sauces they offer.  

Thanks Those Guys Pies, you'll be hearing from me again soon!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh, they sucked.  Ordered a pizza on line while driving back from the desert to pickup on the way back to the hotel.  Walked in on time.  They opened the pizza oven to pull out the pizza and it was burned to a cinder.  Not sure how they couldn't see the smoke coming out of the oven.  The comedy was watching them blame each other for the screwup.  All I wanted was a pizza pie and I got a Archie Bunker episode.  They put another pizza in and here we sit and sit.  Highly NOT recommended.

Got the pizza and it was good."}
{"text":"After reading all the YELP reviews, I trekked 10 miles to give these guys a try as I am seeking a replacement cheesesteak due to closure of my beloved Triple Play.
I ordered the works cheesesteak w/Whiz and an order of chicken fingers with Wasabi Ranch and the Siraicha sauce (don't think I spelled correct sorry).
The cheesesteak was $12 and the fingers were $8.
Neither came with fries, a bit disappointing.
The chicken fingers are definitely hand cut and breaded and are more like 8 regular size fingers elsewhere. The sauce options are unique and were good.
The cheesesteak was definitely better than most but seemed a bit shy on the wiz and the shrooms."}
{"text":"I worked with pizza for 6 years and tend to criticize alot.  The crust at this place is thin and delicious but a little heavy on the flour (which is pretty common) the sauce was good not to thick or thin. But what really got me was the toppings they make meatballs, sausage, and bacon in the store.  And you can tell.  The bacon is thick strips with a sweet glaze and absolutely delicious.  They make phillys.   With whiz.  Also cheese fries.    Not only that but they have hands down the best chicken fingers I've ever had in this city.  Raisin canes can't hold a candle to them.  Try this place out!!!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!!! I mean, how could you not with THE NAME!!! Met Chris, the owner! Everything is SUPER FRESH! They make all their ingredients fresh, their sauces & crust!!! These guys have worked all over the strip this joint has been open for 5 years! Authentic & The GUYS are insanely nice!!!! Great Prices! We finally found our pizza spot close to home!!!! Highly Recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  So so good.  OK It was pricey but wow.  I originally wanted Rocco's but they don't deliver.  Their loss.  So I didn't even order pizza from Those Guys Pies becuz I didn't want to be disappointed but maybe I should have.  I ordered an original cheesesteak with whiz \"with (which means with onions) and mushrooms and peppers,a caprese salad and a mascarpone cheesecake.  The salad was delicious, huge pieces of mozzarella, beautiful heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil.  So fresh, so delicious.  olive oil, balsamic vinegar....so delicious.  The cheesesteak was so juicy, so tasty, delicious.  Then the cheesecake, while WAY TOO small, was delicious.  Very impressed.  Only thing is the $27 price tag but then it was a big salad and delicious.  Worth it.  And They deliver which Roccos does not which is why I chose them."}
{"text":"Our office just moved to the Lakes and what a find this place is!!!!! I am from the East Coast and I miss the food there everyday of my life! Not anymore!! I can go right down the street! Best Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I don't know what people like about this place... Nasty nasty. We got Phil Cheescake sandwich delivered to the house and the bread was all mashy and wet from the wrap.... As we took the first bit the meat had bone not one but many...thank god we didn't break a tooth. The pizza is way to grease not healthy at all. The caprese salad even have fresh tomatoes as in the picture but sun dried tomatoes. Give yourself a favor avoid this place."}
{"text":"Best pizza!!! It's like the Secret Pizza spot in Cosmo, but closer to my house (when I lived in Vegas) and I don't have to walk into a casino! I love their White Pizza with broccoli rab.  Yumss my mouth is drooling as I write this review.  Their cinnamon poppers is a delicious must try item too! The guys in there are super nice and friendly too"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in the neighborhood! The pizza is always amazing and the wings are always cooked to the perfect crisp, the cinnamon sticks are addicting, the jalapeño poppers are definitely and interesting creation but so good! The cheese stake is seriously the best in town reminds me of back east!"}
{"text":"Ordered original cheesesteak with onions mushrooms and cheese whiz. It was good. They do not skimp on the meat!  And if this is an accurate \"authentic\" Philly sandwich, then it made a good impressionon this first time visitor. Next time will try diff cheese though, but that's just my pref. Bread was tasty.  Known about this place since it opened few years ago, but have never been until now. 
Would venture back to try the pizza and other stuff too."}
{"text":"We order delivery with some regularity, and a always get a small pizza and wings which it's enough food for my wife and I to have two meals. The pizza is arguably the best NY style pizza in las Vegas, and their wings are just as delicious. 

While we live only a few blocks away, the delivery time is very fast and the customer service is always top notch. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in need of a meal and too lazy to cook!"}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza!  I would give them 5 stars but they're a little skimpy on the toppings. The best pizza in our area!"}
{"text":"The pizza is not bad, and their cheesesteak tastes different every time I order it. I will continue to go if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Small little hole in the wall pizza joint tucked away in The Lakes neighborhood. Was featured on Triple D and lived up to Guy's review. Staffed by super friendly guys who appreciate their customers. I'd consider this a neat neighborhood jewel worth keeping. 

Had The Works cheesesteak \"wit wiz\" (cheese wheeze to the rest of us).  Great fresh rolled stuffed with chopped grilled ribeye, green peppers and onions. And of course wiz. A very good sandwich. Filling, satisfying and tasty. This is now my go-to Philly. 

Can't wait to work through their pizza offerings."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for cheese steaks and always been pleased. I decided to try their pizza, since they are a pizza joint after all.

I ordered the meat pie, as I was intrigued about their house made sausage, bacon, and meatballs. Unfortunately, I didn't care too much for the pizza. It wasn't bad, but for me it was just a notch above big chain pizza. Sauce, cheese, crust, toppings - all was just average.

I would rate it 3 stars for the pizza, but I put 4 because I really enjoyed the cheese steak here. I will come back for that, but not for the pizza."}
{"text":"I have had a chance to eat from Those Guys Pies a couple of times already since their soft opening, both times were absolutely delicious!  I am a huge meatball pizza fan, but am incredibly picky and hadn't found an easy place to get one from that is good. Their meatball and sausage ingredients blew me out of the water for sure. Definite give them a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Saw this place on Triple D and had to make a special trip to eat here.  The Maui Wawii Pizza with the pulled pork was tasty and rich. We ordered salads too and they were huge.  Even the three cheese fries were great!!  Run don't walk to this place. It beats anything in town.  Maybe hard to find if you do not know the area, and it is small. Service was great and they food was great for the price and quality of freshness."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years and I can honestly say Those Guys Pies have the best pizza and cheesesteaks in town."}
{"text":"It is a real disappointment that their customer service has gone down drastically as they do have excellent pizza. After waiting 45 minutes for my food (15 minutes past estimated time) I got almost all the way home before noticing they gave me the wrong pizza. I turned around and was treated like it was not a big deal that they made me wait and that they were going to make me late for work. Not an acceptable way to treat your customers!"}
{"text":"Aaaaamazing food, had White Pizza, to die for and a Philly cheesesteak with the works, coming back again for sure.
 10 miles off our destination course but,  oh so worth it.  Owner came to check on us, great staff, very little seating but who cares.  Great place, thanks Triple D, good job here."}
{"text":"Id love to post a photo of what I came home with. Needless to say it wasn't something that looked that edible. It should be stated that I only tried this joint once... but there were two kids that looked about 23 making pies, and nobody overseeing how they made them. I'm going to have to look elsewhere for a decent pie. what a disappointment?."}
{"text":"I just had a cheesesteak with provolone and fried onions. It was excellent. The roll was excellent. I am from Philadelphia so I know my cheesesteaks!
This was my first visit.....I will go back. FINALLY Las Vegas has real cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. I've been waiting for so long to visit this place and we finally got to go. When we walked in we're not greeted, we sat down and waited for 5 min until I figured that i had to get my own menu front the front. Waited.....until my husband asked if they were coming to our table or us having to order at the front. The young guy at the front said that we had to order at the front desk, which is a foot away from the table. There's only 2 tables, it's a tiny restaurant. There's No water front view or AC. It was hot, i guess its because you are right next to the kitchen and either it wasn't on or ut wasn't working. We order a large pizza and Mozzarella sticks. The pizza/pie was not that great. I was not impressed, I was expecting something great and delicious and all I got was an average pizza with very little flavor. The mozzarella sticks were ok. 
This was my first and last time here. I trutly believe its all hype thanks to DDD, maybe at some point it was great and now that they are more famous they are lacking flavor and love for the food that they are making."}
{"text":"Always excited to try a new pizza place, met my trusty yelp friend Kevin P for a round of pizza and we arrived to find this place to be delivery/carryout only. Bummer. We decided to order our own pizza and take it home. I ordered half Maui Wowie (house made bacon, pineapple, pickled jalapenos) other half was The Big Sexy (sausage, pepperoni, bacon) a 14\" was $15.  When the pie was ready, they saw how excited I was to dig in, so they offered us half of a table so we could sit and enjoy the pizza hot. I really like the flavors of all the fresh ingredients. They make all their meat and mozzarella in house. Loved the pickled jalapenos. Traded a piece of Kevin's cheesesteak pie (that happens to be made with certified angus beef), this had great flavor.  The pizzas came with a side of crushed red pepper, onion salt, parmesan cheese, and oregano and a side of ranch. As we were injoying our pizza, we got to talking with Sean, one of the owners, and he filled us in on the background, clarifying that they are not affiliated with Secret Pizza. Also he said they have plans in the future to expand so they will have a dining area. As a departing gift, he had us try the maple mascarpone cheesecake, this was a perfect ending to dinner, this was delicious!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on @unlokt and it looked soooo tasty and then I found out it was also on diners, drive ins and dives so I was super excited to try it! But I didn't realize it was in Summerlin so it was too far for them to deliver or even for postmates to deliver it :(

I still wanted to try it so a week later my boyfriend and I decided to drive out there for dinner. We get there and again didn't realize it's not really a \"sit down\" type place (should have looked this up beforehand). We still ordered and decided to take it home, but it just stinks that were about a 20 min drive back home. 

We were so hungry and excited we ordered a lottttt! We got the works sandwich, buffalo chicken sandwich, three cheese fries, pepperoni pizza, and lastly the cinnamon poppers. Talk about eyes being bigger than our stomachs lol. 

The pizza was really good, my boyfriend was obsessed! It was a little cold because of our drive home but still awesome. I can't wait to try one of their specialty pizzas next time! The buffalo chicken sandwich was definitely good, but a little dry- there wasn't much sauce. The works was probably the BEST Philly cheese steak I've ever had in my life. The three cheese fries were also good, but definitely don't recommend getting them if you have a long drive home... They were a bit soggy and cold by the time we got home. And the cinnamon poppers I couldn't even tell you if they were good because they forgot to give us the cream cheese dipping sauce :( but I'm sure with the sauce they are delicious. So maybe next time!

All in all, I would say our drive was worth it. I'm only giving it 4 stars because our wait was a bit longer than we expected and they forgot our dipping sauce. I can't blame the cold food on them because they can't help we live farther away. But I definitely wouldn't be mad if they opened a closer location ;)"}
{"text":"Meh. Was excited for about a minute but then I walked in. The place was soooo hot and the staff seemed aggravated. Couldn't stand the heat inside so had to wait for the order in the heat outside. It was way overpriced. The philly was small and not great but the biggest disappointment was the pizza. Just terrible. Toughest crust ever and the toppings weren't even good. I'm just sad about the whole experience."}
{"text":"First off definitely take advantage of the Yelp free check in cinnamon poppers! Out of this world yummy!!!! My husband and I have been dying to try this place for a while now after hearing about it on diners drive-ins and dives.  I was not disappointed in the quality and taste of the food. Pizza and wings it was with our Yelp poppers, I'm craving it now.  I had a cold piece of the pizza today for lunch two day old and it still satisfied every taste bud! Cold or hot the sauce and crust make it. Not too greasy either. Their wings are flavorful with any sauce and full of meat! The don't come with sauce on but rather give you sauce and a bag to toss yourself.  Our order was take out which I guess most are since there's maybe three tables inside.  We called our order in ahead and waited a few minutes.  I will be ordering from here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is my FAVORITE PLACE. I was alone and wanted pizza, but I'm so grossed out with the bigger pizza chains. So I went on yelp and decided to try Those Guys. I ordered a regular pepperoni pizza and the cheese fries. The guy on the phone was very nice and courteous, and told me it would take 35 minutes for delivery. Honestly it came before the 35 minutes, which made me really happy. And let me tell you, if one of my friends tried Those Guys and didn't like it, I would look at my friend differently from then on, secretly of course, but different nonetheless. I vow to never eat at another pizza place again! even if they give me a life time of pizza. Also can't deny Hottie McHotterson the delivery guy (too much? Sorry) I finished the pizza by myself by the next morning, and I'm ordering the same thing again two days later. Next time (probably in a few days) im going to try the white pizza. Ugh I'm in love. The prices are amazing too, you can get an amazing pizza that is made so well for the same price as a big chain. AND with sides and a 2 liter. Im about to cry...."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice, the First time i got 2 pizza's The Diablo, and The Big Sexy... Just no. The Diablo would have been amazing if they hadnt drenched it in that sweet chili sauce on top, there was just way way too much on it, it was all that was tasted, it was like eating candied pizza... Ick! The Big Sexy.. well it was actually just weird.  have had a similar pizza (same toppings) from another place and liked it, but TGP they put their onions on in HUGE slices, it was all that could be tasted. It wasnt as bad as the Diablo, but It wasnt amazing either. I will probably be passing on their pizza in the future.

The second time I ordered I got Chicken fingers, and 3 cheese fries.. The fries were AMAZING, I mean the cheese was hardish when it got here as it cooled, but they are still great, especially with ranch (not theirs) drizzled all over them mmm. The Chicken Fingers were just nasty. They were big which is nice, but super salty. I mean overly salty, the breading was weird, I LOVE chicken fingers and this is the first time Ive ever passed on them. Their ranch is just weird tasting, its like... they mixed Mayo and Ranch together, luckily I had some in the fridge for the fries. 

I dont think I will be giving this place another shot. To bad I really wanted to like them :/"}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST PIZZA, PHILLY CHEESESTEAKS, and CHICKEN FINGERS in town! I kid you not like everyone I bring here raves about it! The chicken fingers are long chunky strips or chicken breasts that are magnificently juicy and flavorful! My friend's son has now had his mind blown by these fingers so any mediocre pizza shop offering fingers is out of the question! Too bad for my friend who lives across town and now has to drive 12 miles to satisfy her sons new found favorite food.  The Philly cheesesteak is meaty cheesy and everything cheesesteaks are supposed to be about. I've tried like the whole pizza menu and hands down everything is superb! The Philly cheesesteak pizza and plain cheese and white pizza are my favs. Oh and what's in their ranch???? I want gallons of it! Trust me. Try it. You'll be raving about it. You'll be driving across town for it. You'll be telling all your friends about it. The staff is awesome and super friendly and the delivery drivers rock and are super chill. Those Guys Pies! You need to expand!!!!"}
{"text":"I first encountered Those Guys Pies at the Yelp Nerdy Dancing II event, last year. I really liked the slices they served but they were not served hot and I quickly forgot about them. I was finally able to try their pie right out of their Lakes location and man, have I been missing out. 

My husband and I ordered a half Maui Wowie(bacon, pineapple and jalapeños) and half pepperoni pie to split. A few minutes of waiting and it came piping hot, straight out of the oven. The crust was absolute perfection when it came to taste and texture. The sauce is really good and a nice amount that doesn't overpower the other ingredients. It's also not overly tart like some pizza sauces I've tried. The pepperoni topping was really good but pretty standard but the bacon on the Maui wowie was excellent. It was large crispy bacon, not the canadian bacon you see at other pizza joints. I only wish there was more of this yummy porky goodness on the pie.

The store was small and easy to miss because it still didn't have overhead signage. There's a small counter to order from, a couple of chairs and a table which was overtaken by bags of condiments. This is a takeout place. There are no heat lamps at this joint. Call ahead or order your pie fresh and wait. Take the pie home, eat in your car or find an empty table by the fake lake nearby. They also provide a delivery service within 5 miles but I suggest coming down to say hi and experience the pizza hot out of the oven. It's totally worth it. Dare I say this may be the best pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"awesome  buffalo  wings  ,very good pizza.
could use more seating still worth  the trip"}
{"text":"Unbelievable !!   The meat pie and the big wowie and the cheese steaks 

Wow !!   Roy was more than just the owner.  We visited and had dessert.  You must visit here"}
{"text":"Why go all the way to the strip for Secret Pizza at the Cosmo when you can just drive down to the Lakes and pick yourself up a delicious, whole pizza and other Italian treats? There's a lot of pizza options in Las Vegas, but this place remains one of the go to places in my husband's mind. Although we are slightly out of their delivery range, they let us know they'll deliver to us during slower periods (which is super nice of them), but we also have just picked-up here as well. When they have delivered, they did so in a timely manner and food was still fresh. I'm a big fan of their ooey-gooey but still crispy cheese fries, but their Philly cheesesteak just wasn't for me (meat wasn't seasoned well). You can't go wrong with their pizzas - we usually opt for a white pizza and pepperoni. And if they have it, you must get their cheesecakes - truly heaven in a foil container. They do have very limited seating inside the store, but I would suggest getting take-out."}
{"text":"Not only is pizza here is amazing but so is the chicken fingers and the Philly cheese steak sandwich is to die for. 
The big sexy pizza is great choice diffenitly coming back here to try the rest of them.
And the key to great establishment is the staff there are so amazing they set the vibe when they found out when one of us were interested into Iration that they put on some music for us.
Coming back soon and bringing more people
Thank you guys ."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood pizza and sub place.  Love that there is a local, small business pizza delivery that we are happy to support.  The Maui pizza is delicious- fresh ingredients and a perfect blend of sweet and savory.  The meat pie is superior- the sausage makes the pizza.  We also enjoy their subs and wings and of course, the cinnamon bites, which are a must (because the cream cheese frosting is the bomb!).  OMG- Get the CHEESECAKE!  I cannot believe how good it is.  No matter how full you think you'll be from the dinner- get the cheesecake and enjoy it!  You will thank me!!!"}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks are the best I've ever had. You can taste the quality ingredients. Coming back soon for sure"}
{"text":"The a hole manager kept arguing that we ordered on the website no cheese.. who the eff orders pizza with no cheese? I was in a nice mood when I called hoping they would fix the issue.. but that manager was just rude. Their stupid website is just stupid, and he blames me for ordering no cheese. I didn't freakin order no cheese. Kept calling me \"young lady\" condescending piece of crap, instead of apologizing or fixing the issue, the guy CALLS ME BACK on my cellphone to argue some more.. customer service is crap..."}
{"text":"We really loved the cheese bread. It was so fantastic that we would have ordered more if we had known . The cheese bread deserves 5 stars. The reason for 3 stars is because you pay for each topping but they skimped so bad it was unreal. I wanted pineapple and I literally had to look for it. I opened a can at home and added my own. I posted pics to show before and after I added my own."}
{"text":"Sorry You'se Guys....I have tried and tried....but time after time you do it to me again.

Thursday night, we order a pizza.  Pepperoni, Mushroom and Carmelized Onions.  It arrives, I pay, the delivery guy mentions how great it smells, I bring it in....

WRONG PIZZA AGAIN!!! This is a Ham, Pineapple and Jalapeno Pizza.  I  immediately call the store, the owner gets on, starts apologizing, tells me he is firing a new pie for me and will have another one over, in 15 minutes....a fresh, Sausage, Mushroom and Carmelized Onion pizza.... I say great and hang up...

Hold on my wife says...What did you say?? Sausage?  We did not order sausage.  Hold on a minute I say, I grab the receipt, look at it and sure enough....they screwed up the phone order, recording Sausage instead of Pepperoni.  I immediately call the owner back....he answers the phone \"Rick....is this you again?\"

\"Yes,  you are making my pizza wrong, I ordered Pepperoni, not sausage.\" 

\"Please do not send me the wrong pizza two times in a row\"

20 minutes later the pizza arrives.  A very polite man delivers the pizza, wants to retrieve the first wrong pizza, to verify the Hawaiian pizza was in fact delivered to me by mistake (like I would make that up), then he offers to verify the pizza being delivered now is the correct one....NOPE!

SAUSAGE!!! I show the delivery guy the paper I ordered the pizza from with my handwriting, the phone number for the store, and the ingredients for our pie....no sausage, just pepperoni, mushrooms and carmelized onions.  

He apologizes, tells me the owner will probably call me, do something to make it right...yada yada....that was last Thursday.

As much as I like the pizza, I can find other good pizza around this town."}
{"text":"They have the best sausage I've ever had on pizza. There cheese steak is also very good. One suggestion. Maybe you could do without the continuous playing of the Diners Drive ins and Dives episode that featured your place."}
{"text":"We ordered a large Greek and large meat pie. The Greek was missing the spinach. 

Both pies were thrown together. Very doughy and undercooked. The crust was uneven and the sauce was almost nonexistent. 

Overwhelming bacon flavor in the meat pie. Really could not taste anything else.

The wings were good but the pies were terrible. 

We ordered on May 30 and it was night and day from today. 

Don't know what happened but tonight was dreadful. About the worst pizza we've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Seriously great food. Seriously bad service. We ordered 2 Cheese Steaks and cheesy bread and the counter guy took the order repeated it, I corrected him said no onion. He typed something repeated it and then we made sure we said again no onion. And then waited 45 min. Our food was sitting there! Finally I asked about the order, please note only one other family was sitting there so it was clear to see I was waiting forever! I finally asked about the food and they realized it was mixed with other items. They gave us the order and we left only to get home and it have onions. Seriously sucks a place with such great food is understaffed and they can't pump out orders properly. The amount of tickets they had there should have been at least 1 or 2 more people working. I'm sad because I  love the food but I'm not sure if that service is worth it"}
{"text":"cheesesteak came highly reccomended. They meat was great quality but VERY salty. I ordered lettuce, tomato, raw onion...  They tossed them in what I think was vinegar and oil. this pretty much overpowered the sandwich. Wish they had mentioned this and I would have ordered it dry...Vinegar and oil is not a standard on a cheesesteak.  I will try them again because I think it wouldve been good without the salt and dressing..."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the 1st time this weekend at the recommendation from a friend ...

As someone from the city that made cheesesteaks famous - I've had my fair share of good steaks and bad both in Philadelphia and outside of Philadelphia.

While I don't think these were the best steaks that I've ever had - they are definitely one of the better cheesesteaks in Vegas AND they come TRUE to form ... (American, Provolone, or Whiz) and with or without fried onions ... NO GREEN PEPPERS in the equation.    There is adequate high quality meat, chopped correctly, cheese incorporated correctly and great bread (even though it's not Amoroso's) ... but anyone from Philly knows that a good cheesesteak does not have to have an Amoroso roll.

We ordered cheese fries with whiz as well and although I loved the fact that I was able to get fries - I didn't like that they were seasoned fries.  I'd much prefer a standard plain fry that is a little thicker with cheese on top.

We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. \"Will be ready in 25-30 minutes for pick up\" ... 50 minutes later it's ready. Seriously ? You're that incompetent that you can't tell a customer how long it takes to make their pizza ?"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying they were super super friendly the delivery came sooner then they quoted me but the pie wasn't crisp on the bottom like most pizzas. It was a bit soggy but I'll definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"The fellas and I came with appetites for lunch to Those Guys Pies. We all immediately choose the Diner's Drive-In and Dives featured CheeseSteaks. I got the beef. It's shaved ribeye melted with provolone, onions and green peppers. Delicious beef cheesesteaks!!!!!  We also sampled the wings and fingers. It all hit the spot. But beware, the dining room is small. But it's worth the quality food. I tried taking a photo of my cheesesteak but was only able to catch half the sandwich while I was shoveling all that goodness into my belly!"}
{"text":"I have to say after seeing them on DDD I was expecting to be blown away with these pies. I was sadly wrong and highly disappointed. To begin the place is so small there is only two tables to sit at. The over all appearance is not very clean or organized. You are not greated as you walk in and almost not even noticed. Had to get up and waited about 5 minutes before someone finally came to take my order. They offer no fountain drinks but bottled so you end up spending more than expected. My son needed to use the restroom and was told we had to go to another restaurant down the way to use their bathroom... How ridiculous! Once receiving the food the fingers were great but the pie was soaked in grease and just did not look anything worthy of being on DDD. To then encounter no cups for my kids to share a bottled drink, no silverware to cut up smaller slices definitely ruined the experience even more. Was not impressed with the pie at all due to lack of flavor and the crust was burnt. I will not be back to try and have them redeem themselves at all. The only perks of my visit was the some what friendly service we received even though I had to get everything I needed. Also, received a discount for being military. We did notice that if you become regulars you receive your meals for free. Witnessed twice between two different customers. I guess that's a perk if you choose to continue to go back. The chicken wings must have been good employees were back there stuffing their faces with them and also heard them making pies for themselves and their friends... Guess that's another perk of working for this pie company."}
{"text":"The Original Cheesesteak sandwich is to die for. Loaded with meat and cheese of your choice. The cheez whiz is excellent addition. One of the best cheesesteaks in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after reading the other yelp reviews and I have to say, it was delicious. We ordered the cheese steak pie with the 3 cheese fries. Needless to say, this is a hiden gem in Vegas. One of the best hole in the wall spots. I would definitely recommend this place to my closest friends and family. We will be back for sure to try more."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. $18.79 or so for a large pizza and mushrooms on half. Crust is tasty. Not sure if I would go back but definitely worth a try for a first timer."}
{"text":"So we were looking on yelp for some place new to order from and decided to try Those Guys Pies.

We ordered the Maui Wowie Pizza, an Original Cheesteak sandwich a order of wings and a 2 liter bottle of soda. The total was just over $40.00

The guy who took the order over the phone was friendly, the delivery guy was friendly. The food arrived in about 30 minutes.

As far as the food goes, for the price,  I was hoping it would be tastier than it was.

The wings and sandwich were pretty good. I wasn't as impressed with the pizza. 

It wasn't bad, but I really wasn't overly impressed. I'll probably try it again at some point in the future."}
{"text":"These place is incredible it will not disappoint they are very nice they were very helpful the place I nice small joint they only have one table there so just pick up or delivery decent in price"}
{"text":"Sooo of course I came because Guy recommend it! BUT this place exceeded my expectations! I ordered the big sexy and I added ricotta and let me tell you it was amazing! Theres a lot of love in this pie! Unlike any pie i ever tasted! Rob the owner is very sweet and humble and his love for pizzas shows! Im sad we have to leave las vegas!!"}
{"text":"Planned to walk in, order the pizza and eat there. Found out the chairs were hard material and not comfortable so we waited 15 minutes and took the pizza home. We ordered a ten inch sausage and cheese. With the Pizza box wrapped in a large towel it stayed warm  I enjoyed the spicy sausage. The sauce was juicy and tasty. The thin crust was crisp but could have been a little thinner at the edges. Overall a good pie but not good enough to move ahead of our favorite Chicago Pizza in Las Vegas. However, I might have to return to try their Cheesesteak sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the BEST non NYC style pizza place in Las Vegas! This place is like a 20+ mile drive from my house and I still go there often. Their pizza and chicken tenders are just divine!

The pizza I always go with is the Diablo pizza. It's got a ghost pepper sauce as the base, banana peppers, jalapeños, pepperoncinis, and sweet chili as toppings. It's really not that spicy, but I suppose that's not saying much as I order my Thai food at an 8 for mild spice. Either way, if you're a spicy food fanatic you need this in your life. 

The chicken tenders are HUGE, panko breaded, and fried fresh to order. It takes a few extra minutes when picking it up but it's so worth it! The chicken is piping hot and juicy. They have creative dipping sauces such as pineapple buffalo and Thai peanut. 

The customer service is flipping fantastic. There used to be an option to order all the chicken dipping sauces as \"extra hot\" and apparently they did away with it. When my fiancé called and requested it they said they no longer offered their old extra hot option but could put an off the menu hot sauce in our dipping sauces to spice it up more. They could have simply told us it wasn't on the menu anymore, but they went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Major brownie points. 
You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, truly these guys know their way around a kitchen. It's off the beaten path but I can assure you it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers I have ever had in my life!

Excellent philly sandwiches.

Never ordered a pizza, don't know why.

minimal seating so bring a blanket or chairs, have a picnic. 100 ft from a lake. 10 months of the year the weather is beautiful here. Why sit inside."}
{"text":"So I'm from Philly and I wasn't really impressed with the cheesesteak but I'm pretty picky. However, the pizza made up for any shortcomings of the cheesesteak! It had plenty of toppings and was cooked perfectly with a lot of flavor!! Also had fried mushrooms (whatever the accompanying sauce is was really good) and my kid had chicken fingers which were awesome, too. Used the coupon for free cinnamon bites (I think that's what they were called) and was surprised at the generous portion. Overall, I'm happy to have finally found a good pizza spot and I will be back again."}
{"text":"My family is up in Spokane WA. My step dad saw triple D last night and text me about those guys pies. When the wife woke up today I said we're going. We got there right when they opened. The guys were very nice. We ordered spicy Italian red pie.... BEST PIZZA WE'VE EVER HAD!! BOTH OF US AGREE! I also ordered the works cheese steak no mushrooms.... it wasn't anything special. Not bad by any means. Wouldn't get it again though. We will be back for sure though. I can't wait to try all of there pies. I've already told friends and family they have to go there. I have lots of family and friends coming down for march madness. I'll will be getting pies from there and taking them to the strip for my family and friends to enjoy! Those guys is a must for sure!! BEST PIZZA EVER and I'm a flight attendant and travel everywhere!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in west Las Vegas. Great idea to separate the wing components and to provide a plastic bag to mix the chicken and wing sauce at home. Enjoyed a basic pepperoni and house made italian sausage. Just the right ratio between sauce, cheese and toppings. 
Sorry Rocco this will be our new go to pizza joint!"}
{"text":"It was a solid experience, but not mind-blowing pizza. I had this pizza for the first time about three years ago and I remembered it just enough to try it again when we were deciding on where to order delivery from. It was a little soggy by the time it was delivered to us, and I'm slightly disappointed that the basil came in the form of tiny stringy paper looking slices. When paying $1.50 per topping, you expect whole basil leaves, even if they are wilted from the cooking process. 

I can see this being a really good experience if you're eating it there fresh, but maybe next time  I'll try picking it up myself to see how it holds up."}
{"text":"Ode to the Meatball Parm from Those Guys Pies

A perfect blending of texture and taste,
Not a crumb of this sandwich would ever I waste.
The bread to slight crunchiness is toasted;
The meatballs' incredible flavor is roasted;
The sauce is rich from the sun ripe tomato;
The cheese is all melty, does not taste like play-doh.
Order one now - don't procrastinate!
It will be the very best thing you ever ate.

The meatball parmigiana sandwich from Those Guys Pies is just about the most phenomenal thing you can eat on the planet. I had one for dinner the first time 2 nights ago. And then for the rest of the night, I could not shut up about how good it was. So I ordered another for dinner yesterday, but this time, I concentrated really, really hard, so that I could use real words in my review instead of just saying \"yum yum.\" (I concentrated so hard that a poem popped out!) The bread is sturdy enough to hold up to its hearty contents, but it's not tough or anything that you feel you are ripping apart with your teeth. It doesn't have remarkable flavor on its own, but that's fine, because you don't really want it competing with the rest of the mouthwatering taste sensations. It is a perfect canvas for the food art laid atop. The home-made meatballs have superb flavor, and you can see within the herbs that are used in its making. They are dense enough to have good bite. (As in, not fluffy, like when people use breadcrumbs as filler.) I also like the sauce. It is bright and flavorful, but not too fruity or acidic. But  we must not forget to mention the BRILLIANT way this sandwich is crafted - in the way they lay the meat on the bread. Mark my words, it is such a remarkable idea that I have no doubt in a few years, all meatball parms will be made this way. Instead of your typical 3 or so meatballs tucked into the bread - you know, so that sometimes the uneaten part of a ball rolls out of the bun and into your lap - they slice the meat and angle it so that there's no rolling action, and the amount of meat you get with each bite is fairly consistent. Genius. I took a picture that I will upload in a second. I hope you can see it with this review so that you will see what I mean. 

Although I just recently tried the meatball parm, I've actually eaten here about 15 times. Everything I have tried here has been amazing. I'm from Jersey (New, that is), and I have been looking for a great pie (pizza, that is) in Vegas for over a decade. I feel pretty confident saying this is the best in the whole city. (Which, by extension, really means the best in southern Nevada.)

Pizza: Crust is thin like it should be. Our usual order is the sausage & pepperoni pie. Awesome every time. One time I ordered a veggie pie, no cheese, for a vegan friend, and it was the best damn veggie pie I ever had. (Although to be honest, I didn't ask about the crust ingredients, so it may not have been vegan. Please don't tell my friend.) I can't remember exactly what was on it, but it wasn't just the standard pepper, onion, mushroom, tomato. Maybe they added artichoke hearts? I don't know, but the point is, it was mouthwatering.

Cheesesteak: I have also had this sandwich a couple of times. It comes with onions at no extra charge, but I order \"The Works\" to add on peppers & mushrooms an extra $1. It's fantastic. I do think it's a little pricey for a sandwich, (I think the ribeye is $11, which makes the works $12). But - the meat is thinly sliced, and not chewy, like you get with cheaper meat that has a lot of fat and gristle. I can't stand meat that I can't bite through. I know not everyone agrees, but I would rather pay the extra to enjoy my sandwich instead of fighting with it. 
 
Chicken Fingers: very good. The chicken is moist, the breading is good. I can't say there is anything that needs to be improved about them, I just find it hard to get excited about chicken fingers. If you love Raising Cane's, I'm sure you will love these too. The thing that stands out about them is that they are much, much longer than usual. Fun variety in sauces, too.

I might have to get another meatball parm for dinner tonight, for the third day in a row. Seriously, this sandwich is that good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Ordered a couple pies to a friends house for a pool party .... Fast and friendly service! I wish they were closer to my house so I could order all the time. Nice big NY style slices. Whenever I'm on their side of town I will be eating pizza from Those Guys Pies! Can't wait to try a cheesesteak"}
{"text":"This place has been right down the street from my dad's house for all these years and some how we have never tried it until now. Too bad. It could have saved us a lot of trouble of ordering so-so pizza for all this time. 

To start, the gentleman that I ordered from on the phone was incredibly nice and helpful. 

We ordered two pizzas for delivery. One \"Big Sexy\" and one custom made vegetarian pizza. They were both very very good. The vegetarian had their roasted tomatoes and they were the highlight of it all. They were still crisp and juicy but also full of flavor. The gentleman on the phone explained how they are marinated before roasting. It really was a delight on our pizza. Thin, bendable, pizza with a bubbly and crunchy crust. I am sure when we order delivery to the house we will be ordering here from now. 

As always, I like supporting the local joints close to our area."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Those Guys Pies! The Philly Cheesesteak is absolutely delicious. It's defiantly an East coast feel on the West coast. Love everything about this place. Fast service and friendly workers. You don't know what your missing! You have to try it."}
{"text":"Great pizzas, but those chicken wings!! After driving home, they were still perfectly crispy on the outside, and moist inside. And they deliver too! My new pizza go to place."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this pizza place. The sauce is good, toppings are fresh. The the pizza bread is actually quit impressive. Not soggy or under done just perfect. They deliver in a timely fashion as well. Nothing bad to say about this place. Would order from them again!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing! Got the white pie, chicken fingers with barbecue sauce and a buffalo garlic parm sauce, and the cheesy garlic! So excellent, the pizza and chicken fingers were my favorite. The place itself is really small, and they only have bottled drinks but we sat outside and had a great view of the lakes! Can't wait to be back and try new items!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place on The Food Network's, 'Drive-Ins, Diners, and Dive'.  I LOVE pizza, so since we were I. Las Vegas, we decided to check it out. We ordered the 'Big Sexy' - it was FREAKIN AMAZING. I honestly think this may have been the best pizza pie I have ever eaten.
The place is very big (seating for less than 20 people), and not very 'fancy', but that is more than made up for in BIG flavor and service.  
Those Guys Pies is way off the 'Strip' is more than worth the trip if you want some amazing pizza and a decent price."}
{"text":"Those guys do a great pie, authentic, fresh ingredients and great sauce, the best in Vegas. The cheesesteaks are as good as anything in Philly, wit wiz, shredded rib eye,  fantastic bread,  I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The order was wrong, was asked to pick it up in 20 minutes but took 35 minutes, and the pizza dough center completely fell apart, on almost all slices. Terribly disappointed, for the price, any other pizza joint would beat it."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great cheesesteak - just like East coast. Note that there is really no seating and it is a take out joint."}
{"text":"Ordered a Big Sexy to go and it smelled so good we ate half in the car on the way back home.
Great crust and loved the combination of toppings. We were visiting LV and hit this on our DDD quest. Glad we made the drive from our hotel to try this out and will definitely go back the next time we are in town so we can try something else on the menu.

Note: for some reason their sign was not on the building above the business and we almost missed it. It's tucked towards the back of the little center and hard to see with out the sign. Look for their sign in the windows. It's there and worth the effort."}
{"text":"My husband & boys love this place. Great pizza, awesome Philly & perfect fries. We are definitely ordering again from here!!"}
{"text":"So this was our top destination stop on our trip to Vegas and OMG! so worth it!!!

We had the Bbq maui wowie pizza and it is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. Absolutely delish and the guys there are super cool. Thanks so much and we will see you whenever we are in town.

We had to come back 1 more time before we left town and it did not disappoint. And YES you must add that thai pizza to the menu. It will be a hit.

We will be back next year when we come back to town.

Thank you again for the taste of my youth with those dough bites, brought me back to hampton beach in the summer time.

You guys rock and made our trip absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Philly cheese steaks. Friendly service, We ordered The Mowie Wowie pulled pork pizza with the works Philly cheese steak. The best in Vegas. I would eat here more often."}
{"text":"Went to those guys pies cause we saw them on triple D first off I hate giving bad reviews but this place was on the triple d  I was expecting a mouth watering explosion and that was by far not the case. To start  no air conditioning in the establishment hello your in las Vegas it's August you need that fixed. Second we ordered the bbq Maui wowie pizza (seen on ddd) and an order of chicken fingers. the pizza was very bland, sauce had no flavor the best tasting thing was the pineapple. The cheese looked hardly present and what was present looked old. Not to mention the slice I had  had a plastic string in it which looked like fishing line. The best thing I ate was the chicken fingers even tho they gave me the wrong sauces. So disappointed not sure if I'll ever make the drive from Aliante to this place again. Boo"}
{"text":"Just visiting from San Diego ca. Great cinnamon poppers i ever had i would recommend to everyone can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over a year now and I guess it's time for an update.  Still the Best Philly that I have had here in Vegas!  I have tried every pizza on the menu and they still have great quality ingredients that they had a year ago.  Our favorite is the Meat Pie the day after a night of drinking!  Just the right amount of grease for our hangover!  Keep up the good work Guys!!"}
{"text":"The Cheesesteaks here are now the best I've had in town! There was a flyer put on my door earlier in the week from this place and it sounded good so hubby and I gave this place a try. Hubby actually ordered a \"Original Cheesesteak\" with cheese whiz, onions and peppers, but I ended up eating almost half of it. I just loved the flavor and enjoyed every bite! The sandwich was 10 inches long and stuffed with thinly shaved beef. We shared a order of \"Mozzarella Sticks\" priced at $7 and they were cheesy. Each one had their own unique shape as they are hand breaded to order. Be prepared for lots and lots of oozing cheese with these! I do wish the breading had more flavor, but they are totally worth ordering. I ordered a \"Italian White Pie\" priced at $16.50 and it was 14 inches. The pizza had mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic and caramelized onions. I liked the pizza, but it actually tasted much better re-heated the next day for lunch. The guy who took our order and gave us our food was nice. I'd like to come back and try some of their other pizzas, sandwiches, salads and of course I will be back for more cheesesteak! 

Delivery is offered. Check the website to see if you are in the delivery area. They have different lunch specials daily."}
{"text":"Out of sight, out of mind. Maybe that's why this place doesn't get the love it deserves. Tucked away in an old strip mall by The Lakes, you have to hunt to find this place. It's a tiny shop with virtually no room to dine in. Take out or delivery are your only options. Specializing in New York-style pies, you'll find crusts with a good balance of crispiness and chew that are slightly blistered. I've been meaning to try their red sauce, but their white pies are so good I haven't passed them up. My usual order has been an 18\" white pie ($22) with added caramelized onions, pepperoni, and mushrooms. The 'shroom pie with the white sauce wasn't bad either, full of a variety of mushrooms. Service has been friendly and efficient, even during peak hours. For take out, Those Guys has become my go-to place for a quick-fix of pizza.

4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. After seeing some great reviews, we tried a couple of pies via delivery. The staff was great from order taking to delivery. 
 The pizza itself fell flat. It reminded me of a supermarket pizza. Sauce was nothing to write home about. Nothing made it stand out. The crust was too doughy and lacked any flavor. The cheese was non distinct. A good amount of grease on top."}
{"text":"Average at best. We decided to dine in and I expected to hear noise and talking since the kitchen is so close to the dining tables but I didn't expect to hear swear words the entire time. The staff is seemed very unprofessional. The pizza isn't that great either, felt it pretty much equated to a take home frozen pizza or papa johns. If you're in the area I would drive the few extra miles down to grimaldis since it would definitely be a better pizza at the same price."}
{"text":"It's funny how things change as the years of our lives pass by. 

I can remember, with vivid clarity, how obsessed I was in my college years about pizza. We spent just about every night out, me and the boys, which would almost always end at someone's pad with Sports Center and pizza. There would be a ten minute debate, each of us making a case for toppings and our favorite pizza joint, until a consensus was reached and an order was placed. Then we would all dig deep for crumpled bills and pocket change to cover the pie (and a little something for the driver).

I could eat almost a whole pie back then, most of us could. But after a long night of partying and spending  way too much money buying drinks for that cute chick in the corner (who was never going to give me her number anyway), the few bucks we had left wasn't going to get us more than a couple of slices each. So when the pizza finally arrived, it would be half gone by the time the delivery guy closed the door (you didn't want to be the guy paying the driver, trust me).

The funny thing is, back then I don't think it really mattered where we got the pizza from or what we ordered on top. When all was said and done and the grease stained box lay empty on the living room floor, each of us would lie back and sound out a deep, satisfying groan of pleasure, as if we had just devoured the tastiest treat on planet Earth. Night after night, pizza after pizza - and each time with the same satisfying moan and a big smile.

And then one day we suddenly realize (as if the past 20 years caught us asleep at the wheel) that we are actually driving 20 miles across town, through rush hour traffic and lights on a mission to destroy us, all the time conflicted about whether we should even try parking  or just pay the $5 for valet, then zigzagging a half a mile through crowds and crowds of bewildered tourists stopping at every little sparkling thing they see, then up three long  flights of escalators, stuck behind some woman who is clearly unaware that the ocean of perfume she bathed in that day is causing the wallpaper to peel (cough!) -  just to grab a slice from the only place we swear we will ever eat pizza from again.

My how things do change.

So now's the time for some good news - if you live on the West side (or if you're up for a drive) stop by Those Guys Pies. It's everything you used love about Secret Pizza (apparently the guy is over here now), without the hassle that is the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"First time visit and it was awesome , it's an it too small to dine in for me so we took our food to go.. The cheesesteak sandwich was the bomb.. I only ate half as it's so big and filling .. took the rest to work the following day and it was just as good.. I'm not a pizza fan so I won't rate their pineapple sausage pizza , I had a bite. My husband and son liked it , they too order cheesesteak sandwiches and struggled to finish that as well.. We'll  definitely be back for more..."}
{"text":"Ok...     They make everything from scratch.    So let me just say...   Im so happy to have found this place.   Its the new go to pizza.   We got the BBQ Chicken pizza and man was that good.   Cant wait to order again!!!"}
{"text":"Stuffed my face with a delish and dangerous dinner tonight. I love to come here when I need to mend a broken emotion or have a meal hit that spot I didn't even know needed hitting! 

I had my favorite: buffalo chicken sandwich (I am obsessed with buffalo sauce, I can drink it) and added an order of French fries. For $2.50 you get a mountain of fries. No joke. And, they are Perfectly seasoned. On point. 

My sandwich was incredible; juicy, well seasoned and drenched in delicious sauce. It was also topped with onions. I am obsessed with those too. 

One thing that is a Big Fail with my meal tonight are the chicken strips. Half of them were RAW inside. I ate around and what I could but that was absolutely unappetizing and gross. I was really bummed out. One half of the sandwich was mostly good and the other was mostly inedible. 

Come on guys... Rookie mistake."}
{"text":"I had a do-over with Those Guys this evening and the experience was night and day. The pizza was fantastic and their IPA wing sauce is so delicious, my husband and I agreed we would buy it by the bottle. Their fingers are so yummy, whole pieces of chicken breast breaded to order and they do carry blue cheese! The packaging of the food was even different compared to the last time we ordered so I'm passing off our last experience as a fluke. The real test will be the next time we order. 
Chris saw my prior review and took the time to chat we me about it he acknowledged the difficulty with the ordering system said they were working on updating it."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D and decided to check it out. Little hole in the wall place no seating really to sit down and eat so got our pie to go. Got the Maui wowie with their homemade bacon pickled jalapenos and fresh sliced pineapple. my husband is quite the pizza connoisseur and he love to this pizza! Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fanfriggintastic!!!  My sweetie struggles with pricing nowadays, saying the value simply isn't there - so to say he was very pleased on all accounts is to say a lot!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, the outside was crispy but the middle was soggy and very messy. It had a good taste, but I ordered the Hawaiian  Maui wowie and they gave me the BBQ Maui wowie!! I even told the skinny gal with a lot of tattoos the order twice.Not sure what that was about... my daughter really enjoyed her chicken parm sandwich. We ate outside and had a view of the lake from behind a fence, there's only 3-4 tables inside. It was ok but I'm sure not going out of my way again to visit, plus next time I'd probably just split a sandwich."}
{"text":"I went here for the philly cheesesteak but wasn't that impressed.  The cheesesteak I got from Pellegrino's was far superior."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in a while! Get away from the strip for a bite to eat at Those Guys Pies! The service was impeccable and I felt like I was right at home. The food did not disappoint :) we ordered a regular pie and the ribeye Philly cheesesteak with mozzarella, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just ate the best pizza in Las Vegas!  We usually order from Rocco's, which is also good but wanted to try something new.  So glad we chose Those Guys Pies!  We ordered a large (18 colossal inches!) pizza and a cheese steak with whiz...both were delicious.  We picked our order up and were completely intoxicated by the smell the entire 10 minute ride home.  The pizza crust was perfect...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside...perfect.  The red sauce had excellent flavor and delicious.  The home-made sausage and sweet onions on top were to die for.

The cheesesteak was also amazing...excellent quality steak and full of flavor.  I agree with other reviews...the best in town!

We hope they are able to expand and offer seating on location one day soon so we can eat it as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Everyone needs to try this place.  You won't be sorry!!  This is our new favorite!!"}
{"text":"This Place has amazing cheesesteaks and the pizza is out of this world! Shout out to Denise and Jeff for making us feel welcomed They are very hard-working and super sweet employees. Also, Trey is amazing as well .....Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place has top of the line pie and I take my pizza very seriously. The shroom pizza is magnificent(add bacon and chicken) . I've ordered 3 times now and my only complaint would be that they make the buffalo chicken spicier because at the moment it's not at all. TRY THIS PLACE! The fingers and dipping sauces are awesome too, I suggest the siracha aoli and the buffalo ipa"}
{"text":"Ok so  now I can say without a doubt that Those Guys Pies are the best pizza I've had in the valley. My family and I have ordered from them four times now, each time ordering something else, and I can't find a negative thing to say. So I have now tried the pizza, wings, mozzarella sticks, salads, I'm now going to try the cheesesteaks. I have a feeling I won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"If you've read a couple of my posts, you've noticed that I like to go eat at places featured on television. Especially Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. This is another of those places. The fact that they serve pizzas and cheese steaks didn't hurt my desire to go.

My wife and I ate cheese steaks for lunch. I had thought of taking half of mine to work that night. Bad idea. Ate the whole thing for lunch.

I ate what is called \"The Works\". A ten inch thinly shaved rib-eye with onions, mushrooms, green peppers and in this case, provolone cheese.

My wife had \"Italian Steak\". A ten inch shaved rib-eye with caramelized onions, broccoli rabe, and provolone cheese\".

Dining in is not the best of options, only a few tables, the place is very small.

When you walk in you will notice one television, with only one show being aired.

The show is Diner's, Drive-In's and Dives. I mentioned to my wife that it would be funny if this were the episode that features Those Guys Pies. Sure enough that was the episode that was showing. After that episode, it ran again. Coincidence? I think not. As we were putting on our coats to depart, the cook, owner, guy you see on television with Guy thanked us for stopping by, and made a little chat. I happened to notice while eating how hard he worked, how messy his work apron was. 

That's what I like, a cook who had a messy apron !"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks in Las Vegas, and coming from a native Philadelphian, you can trust that opinion :) Great service as well; I always have a good chat with the owner when I go in."}
{"text":"This came up as a Dd&d place that I had to try out. When I got here I decided that I would eat The Works cheesesteak in the store and take a pizza home for dinner. 

This is a small restaurant with two 6 tops in it. When I was here there were 5 people and we had to share a table. No big deal to me, especially when the food is good. 

Cheesesteak - Wow. It was great. You can see the picture. 

Pizza - Fantastic. You can see the picture of it too.  I've been looking for a new pizza place for quite some time. Too bad this place is so far from my house.

Service was great and friendly. With the check-in on Yelp I was given a free cinnamon popper desert. 

I definitely recommend this place just like Guy."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas.. We drove all the way from Henderson just to try this place. Ordered Big Sexy and White Pie w/ Sausage. Yumm! Definitely worth the drive. This is a hidden gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh pizza shop tucked away in the Lakes. Outside seating overlooking the lake and some inside seating too."}
{"text":"My review is for takeout. I can imagine not giving 5 stars for ambiance etc if you're dining-in, because this place is a bit of a hard find & it seems as tho you should take your loot and be on your way, why you wanna hang around anyway? Got no friends? Love watching the Guy Fieri loop in their tv? The pizza was a bit pricey $39 for 2 regulars, but here's the thing, I like everyone worse have been lulled into buying the Papa Johns crap where it's always a $25 BOGO deal or some other marketing that gets me to buy their stuff. Those Guys Pies on the other hand, was WELL WORTH THE PRICE!!!  The crust was good, sauce was phenomenal & the ingredients were tasty and fresh. We got the white pie with mushrooms & the Greek pizza. We're not vegetarians, but we don't like meat on our pies. The 14 inch Regulars were HUGE too! Vegas has no shortage of amazing food/ restaurants & I'd put this near the top!"}
{"text":"Delicious. The Diablo has just enough to make it enjoyable for everyone, next time I'll request it spicier just for myself though! The shroom was good too! My only complaint is it's not close enough to my house which could be a good thing for my wallet."}
{"text":"We tried an original cheesesteak (ribeye & white american cheese) & the triple cheese fries. The fries were to die for!! And we loved the spicy BBQ sauce they gave us to dip. The cheesesteak was also delicious! The restaurant is small, not much seating available. We would 100% comeback because the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Out of the few times I've ordered from this  place, I gotta say...  I love their pizza!!!!
The pizza gets five stars as does the staff!"}
{"text":"This place beats jersey mikes and caps Philly any day! Right amount of everything for a delicious Philly cheesesteak! Along with their pizza! Hard to find place in the plaza and tiny spot. Great service from all the guys! Got a lot of people addicted to this place. Must try when out in vegas!keep it up guys"}
{"text":"DON'T ORDER DELIVERY FROM HERE.. This business started off great, and is the WORST now. It's Monday night (10/16/17) around 7pm. Ordered an 18\" pizza and was quoted 45min. Called 55 min later and they said delivery will be made any minute and to call back if it doesn't get delivered within 10min. Called back 15min later, and they said we'll call the deliver guy right now. Seriously? it takes them a 2nd call to check on the delivery?? Pizza eventually arrived an hour and half after i placed the order--that's double the time i was quoted! if things couldn't get worst, pizza was completely cold, stale and had formed grease pools, and all sides were forgotten AGAIN. They forgot our sides on the last two orders too, and their delivery guy never has at least some crushed peppers in his car... called them right away, and no answer. Called the delivery guy right after, and asked him to please come back and return my money and take their pizza back. Nothing for 15min, so i called the store again and asked for a manager. Manager get's on the phone and i tell him what's wrong. He apologized and said they are busy, and when i told him that it's not okay to take an order when you are too busy to honor the time you quote and then deliver a cold pizza for $30. He said \"you are right, but i have other business to attend to right now\"... excuse me??? Well Sir, f*** you and your professional ethics then, because this is the last time I gave TGP my business! This place is not even worthy of the 1 star minimum required to leave a review."}
{"text":"Drove from the NW to eat here after seeing Triple D. Wanting to enjoy it fresh and hot I was disappointed when I got there and saw one table. We ordered a veggie pizza with pepperoni (don't judge) and The Works cheesesteak. They were out of provolone - let me repeat that. Out of provolone. We came back in the 25 min. they told us and not only was it ready but the one table was empty so we sat down to enjoy the food fresh. I opened the pizza box and there was no pepperoni. Ok, mistakes happen. They offered to make us a new pie which we declined. Hey, it was a mistake. We did take them up on free bottle of water and a refund on the cost of the add-on. 

The food was DELICIOUS!  Really good. I hope they get over their growing pains soon so people can have a good experience. It was the worth the couple of minor mishaps."}
{"text":"Delivery was speedy. Pizza was VERY soggy. Couldn't even get through one slice. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Well so far the service sucks.  I ordered online at 11:30, and was given an estimate for delivery at 12:27... a while, but okay... Then at 12:44, nearly 20 min late, they call to tell me they'll be another 45 min to an hour late on top of that!  We better get a refund...  This is unacceptable.


Update:  Okay, so when I talked to them, I felt bad because they seemed to have become popular in a short amount of time, and had just not figured out how to grow/evolve yet, to handle it.  We decided to give them another try (this time pickup instead of delivery), and I'm so glad we did!  It turns out, the reason for the influx of customers is due their recent debut on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  After the airing of their place on the show last Sunday, business exploded, and they haven't had time to adjust to it.  

We ordered a half pepperoni, half Greek pizza, cheese-steak hoagie, and fries.  ALL of it was delicious and hot.  It was a bit of a wait, but we knew that going into it, and since we didn't have to depend on a delivery that would never come, it was a lot less frustrating.  It's our new go-to spot for pizza and cheese-steaks... well... our go-to when we can afford to wait a little bit, or at least plan ahead a little."}
{"text":"This is the best cheesesteak in vegas.

I'm from the philadelphia area, so I'll break it down for all my fellow cheesesteak experts on what their cheesesteak is like:

Cheese- choice of whiz, provolone, or white american. I ordered whiz, it was mixed into the meat, not poured on top, making an equal cheese-meat ratio

Meat- good quality angus beef. Cooked perfectly, but not crusty. Finely chopped, not served in a big hunk like at Geno's. On the juicy rather than greasy side. 

Onions- sliced thinly, not diced. These are probably the thinnest sliced onions I've had on a cheesesteak.

Roll- the roll was, hands down, the best part. Perfectly soft and crusty. A+++++++ for the roll. No sesame seeds on the roll.

They have a number of options for cheesesteaks, such as hoagie style (with lettuce and tomato),  pizza steak (marinara sauce) and an italian steak with provolone and broccoli rabe (a la tony luke's, they have a similar sandwich there).

Also, they NEVER refer to a cheesesteak as a Philly.

I can't wait to try the pizza. but the cheesesteak was totally baller."}
{"text":"Over at the go raw cafe for the 1st time and I see this pizza shop. Well new to the valley I have to get a pie to take home to try. Nice shop and very helpful staff. I got a nice pie half white with mushroom half meat. I really enjoyed the pizza as did my family. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I got a flier in my front door advertising Those Guys Pies.  Noting how close it was to where I live, I filed it with some other take out menus I have.  We decided to have pizza for dinner so why not try something different.

I called and ordered a Big Sexy--a pie with sausage, pepperoni, garlic, onion, and pepperoncini.  It is offered in two sizes--14 inch regular and an 18 inch \"big pie.\"

I was home in a few minutes and the pizza was still warm but not hot.  It was a good pizza with a nice crust and plenty of toppings.

We had leftover slices that I froze and I would remove one from the freezer the night before I was going to have it for breakfast.  Leftover, cold pizza--talk about breakfast of champions!

This is basically a take out place.  There are only a few tables in the tiny restaurant.  The name is not above the door outside but rather in the window.  

Finally, if it matters to you, Those Guys Pies was on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  II first heard about the place from a couple from New York who like to try Triple D places when they travel.  Because of the lack of seating, they ended up heating the warm pizza in 100 degree weather in Desert Breeze Park.  That speaks to the lack of dining space inside.

They serve a very credible pizza and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Those Guys Pies changed my life!   Try the Philly Cheese Stake, BBQ Maui Wowie and Big Sexy!!!!!"}
{"text":"There is a reason it has so many good reviews and its WAY out off the strip. It is well worth the 15 minute drive for this incredibly flavorful and cheesy pizza!

I always get the white pie so I can't tell you about the other pizzas. The white pie is covered in cheese and then fresh ricotta cheese is added on top. If you don't like delicious pizza, don't come here. 

Another \"must stop\" places when I come out to Vegas. Stop reading this review and start driving to their location."}
{"text":"I read a few of the reviews and decided to order delivery from here. We got wings and an 18 inch pizza. The wings were delicious. I love that they put the wing sauce on the side so that you can toss them. They are so much better that way! For the pizza, we did half white, half buffalo chicken. Both were very good! I was looking forward to trying their cheesecake but they ran out unfortunately. Next time! 

The food was delivered 15 minutes earlier than what my confirmation email said. And the food was still pretty warm when we got it! I'm very impressed and will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza and cheese steaks in town...home made mozzarella. ..
Don't miss it! !"}
{"text":"PICK UP ONLY!!!

Until further notice, this is a pick up only joint and no sit downs.  Wish I read this on one of the earlier reviews but nope.  You can sit but it will have to be outside on the rinky dink table next to the Lake or a bench in front of another business.

I had the intentions (with Yelper Angela T)  to come in and sit down to try these new pies but there was no sit down option, there's a flat table to the right when you walk in but it was more for their business.  However, we met with the person running the joint, Sean B., and he offered us chairs to sit down and have a slice or two.  I immediately took a bite out of my pie because the toppings looked fresh and it tasted as it looked.  

I ordered half a big sexy and half cheese steak pie, both great and had a kick to it.  The pie and box comes with small containers of additional condiments such as peppers, cheese, garlic.  The true test for me however is how it tastes in the morning, and Those Guys Pies passed.  

The upside down cheesecake was delicious, I would definitely recommend picking up an order of those.  It's not too much, and it's not too small, for how sweet it is it fits fine on the container they use now.  Some reviews state the thin crust, I've had thinner but I like this place because of how stacked the good quality ingredients are on the pies.  Enjoy and save me a piece!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Grabbed some lunch and the pizza and wings were spot on. Friendly staff and really cool. Definitely stop back."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is horrendous! 1hr and a half for 2 sandwiches and the got it wrong. So it's gonna take me over 2hrs to get a sandwich? SMH. I'll just drive to POPS next time. There's one table in this restaurant to sit and management is rude as hell! I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Best authentic cheesesteak this side of philly! fresh, soft bread and hot melty meaty goodness without the yucky fatty fakeness. yummm! pizza was freshly hand tossed to perfection, yummy spicy sausage and premium toppings made for a delicious pie. found these guys on Yelp, drove across town to try them out. worth the drive, want to go back tomorrow before we head back home! and awesome customer service to boot. super nice guy at the counter made it a great meal."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza place. You can't go wrong with the cheese steaks, and the wings come with a turkey bag so you can toss them in as much or as little sauce as you like. I love the meatballs and the bacon, just ridiculously good brown sugary bacon.  All of the ingredients are super fresh. My favorite pies are the shroom white, with goat cheese and seasonal mushrooms, and the meat pie. I usually split the pie down the middle for some variety, you can get any two gourmet pies in one here.  There's virtually no place to sit here, so grab it to go or make an order for delivery.  If you prefer pizza hut or domino's then kill yo self. Eat those guys pies and slap yourself a few times for me."}
{"text":"Ordered a small meat pizza, OMG, was it ever loaded.  Took it home for my son and I, he moaned as he ate 2/3 of it that night!!!  Comment after comment on how it was one of the best pizzas ever and amazed at the amount of toppings!  These guys are generous!  And top quality to boot!  Plus, as I waited we chatted for a bit and the gentleman who waited on me was so nice!  Thank You!"}
{"text":"Cheesesteaks are simply the best! East coast food on the west coast.. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I have been to pretty much every place in Philly known for their cheese steaks and Those Guys Pies has it right. Only place in LV offering whiz that I know of. They offer provolone and white American as well.

The pizzas are awesome too!

Plain cheese and the meat are my favorites.

Did I mention they deliver? 

You cannot go wrong with this place for a pizza or cheese steak. Well worth the drive."}
{"text":"I went back to Those Guys Pies after several months. Wow, I forgot how DELICIOUS their cheesesteaks are! I've had a few decent cheesesteaks, but these are the BEST!  I haven't had their pizza yet, but I'm sure It will be just as great!"}
{"text":"Love these guys! Truly the closest to east coast style I've had out here. We live close by and get take out regularly.."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and I'm so glad we did! It did not disappoint, the food was delicious. It's very small inside with 2 tables or there's a couple cafe tables by the lake but they deliver a 4 mile radius also. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. Called in an order and picked it up myself. Philly Cheesesteak-w/ mushrooms, onions and provolone. And an order of fries. Pricing seems on point. An order of fries is $3 but, you practically get a whole bag of them. I love fries-however these were soooo salty-I could barely finish them. The cheesesteak was mediocre at best. Size was fine, bread was just ok and soggy once the cheese melted.  Guess I won't be going back here anytime soon. The pizza I had the first time was alright."}
{"text":"I saw this while binge watching Diners drive-ins and dives around dinner time and I had to order. The Verdict; Fabulous! We ordered delivery for 2 of their signature cheesesteaks, a White pizza, wings of various flavors and a Canoli and it was ALL Amazing! Delivery was quick, we received our delivery in approximately 45 minutes! The Cheesesteak was the best I have had in 7 years living in Vegas for sure and possibly ever! I'll definitely be ordering again! I have looked all over for a White Garlic Pizza like this since leaving my favorite in Arizona years ago. This after too many failed attempts FINALLY hit the spot! If we had not had pizza The night before I probably would've gotten more pies but I will definitely be re-ordering so it will not be a problem"}
{"text":"Although its a little ways from the strip the pizza is worth the drive! me and my gf where in Vegas for a mini vacation. We remembered seeing this spot on diners drive ins and dives so we decided to give them a try and was not disappointed. The pizza was fresh and delicious we got the sausage,pepperoni with jalapeno and it was amazing and their service was great too! if your in town give them a try definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"We love a good NY style pizza, and chose this place as it was the closest to home with the best reviews. The guys working were great, and I love that they offered  mozzarella, onion powder, pepper flakes and oregano to go. 

That said, the cheese pizza we had was just okay. We were hoping for a thinner crust, more grease to be sitting on top of the cheese, and the sauce to be tangier. 

We are still in search of a great NY style pizza here in Vegas. Hope we can find it."}
{"text":"Food: 3

I was expecting more from this based on accolades and was disappointed with the pizza and cheesesteak sandwich. I tried the original cheesesteak wit whiz and it was \"ok\" due to lack of seasoning. It was filling to say the least, and the ribeye was tender, but just not as flavorful as I expected.

On the pizza side, we had the spicy italian red and it wasn't spicy. It was greasy (yeah, I know sausage will make it greasy) although the crust was very good. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would probably eat here again, but I would not drive from the strip for it."}
{"text":"Finally they are selling SLICES get in there and eat the NY way 2 Slices and a drink.
Forget the Philly"}
{"text":"Well... I'm having mixed feelings about this restaurant.  I ordered The Works philly cheese steak sandwich and the 3 cheese fries. The food was good.  Not the best, but good to where i wouldn't have had any issue going back.  I returned shortly after because a friend requested food and while i was paying,  i noticed a  flying bug (the ones that are attracted to lights) landed on me 3 to 4 time.  I looked up and there was an infestation of these critters  covering the lights inside! Employee acted as if they were house hold pets. There was no reaction to them so either its the norm for them or they just didn't care.  Until they fix this pest issue i will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"The french fries are horrible.  The location is hidden hard to find and the smell had a strong onion odor in the place."}
{"text":"I was really really split on this... a four or a five. If you look at my record I only have 7 five stars against my 100 and whatever so... that means quite a bit of awesome happened this day. I think the best part was meeting the 75 year old chain smoker while we waited for our pizza but... I digress. 

BBQ Chicken... delicious. One of my favorite BBQ pizzas ever... which I guess doesn't tell the whole story. They use a great BBQ sauce that mixes well with the chicken and cheese and yum.

The garlic chicken - I think... I dont remember haha. But what i do know is that there was ricotta cheese on them which is a freakin must and a half. (what does must and a half mean... no one knows.) But it was so good i loved the garlic mixed with mozzarella.

The Cheese sticks... great I would suggest getting some with your order (total price ended up around 40). I am writing this review while hungry and I am just craving this pizza. It is the perfect comfort food. And the perfect make you fat food. Thats how you know its good.

THE VERDICT: best pizza place in vegas. I dont know i only went to one... but a who gives a damn... yes it is the best. It is out of the way but it will be the perfect drunk snack for you, and the perfect hangover snack in the morning for you and your significant other... or insignificant other in the room with you. Long live those guys!"}
{"text":"I must say this is my favorite pizza place for delivery. Everything they sell is amazing. The pizza is crispy yet slightly soft in a rather tantalizing contrast to its crunch. The sauce is impeccable with just enough of the facets of flavor we seem to adhere to when it comes to red sauce.  Oh and the white pies....muahh

I also have to say their cheese-steaks are so amazing.

Also after my 4th delivery the owner came out personally to thank me for my business. Cmon, even if the food was mediocre this would be enough to keep me ordering.

Thanks Those Guys

{"text":"Their dedication to customer service here is unparalleled! After my last review with the soggy pizza, they wrote me to offer me a pizza to replace the other and give them another chance at my convenience. While it never crossed my mind to stop patronizing this establishment, the gesture meant a lot! 

Every pizza that I have had since has been top notch! The last time I was in the joint to pick up pizzas I mentioned my previous experience with the driver waiting for me to get back into my apartment, and they were like \"oh that's you!!\" Only slightly embarrassed about locking myself out, and being recognized by my Yelp reviews. I guess I'm pretty much famous now. =P

They also have Mexican Cokes in the bottle!"}
{"text":"The first time we had pizza from Those Guys we thought it was amazing. We picked up our order of pizza and cinnamon poppers and we all really enjoyed it and complimented the sauce, crust and overall freshness. The last two times we ordered, the quality has steadily declined. Last time the crust wasn't quite the same and it was greasy. We figured we would give it another shot tonight and ordered same toppings we did the first time we ordered. It was worse, sadly. The crust was dense and hard to chew, the cheese had congealed and sauce had soaked through and appeared to us maybe it had been sitting a while?

We figured this would be the pizza place we order from when our little ones want pizza night, but after tonight and finishing only a few pieces from a regular size pie, we will be branching out and ordering elsewhere from here on out. It's always sad hen a place goes downhill after just a couple visits. 

Maybe it was the fact that we did delivery and not takeout? Who know. Either way, we won't be doing Those Guys next time we order unfortunately. I'm giving 3 stars because initially I would have given a 5 star review, but after the last two visits and them being more like 1-2 star reviews, I just took a couple stars off. Any advice I would give would be, don't so delivery. Maybe that'll help? I do want to add that my husband said they when he picked the pizza up the first time we ordered he said the owner was cranking out the pizzas and really seemed passionate about what he was doing. Tonight we both thought maybe the owner didn't do the last two pizzas because they were so different."}
{"text":"Simply the best. Orderd a pizza Was ready 20 min... great Crust terrific taste. Thouse Guys Sure know there Pizza,,,,"}
{"text":"Roy love your pizza, cheesesteaks and wings.... I have enjoyed cheese whiz in many years. Dont miss the grilled veggie sandwich it was off the charts. Delivery always on time."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try the pizza since a recent Yelp event where they were giving it out. Simply put, this is really good pizza. If you don't fell lik making the trek out to Henderson, but you feel like pizza on a friday night with a good movie and beer, this is your place. 

I tried a pizza with salami and mushrooms and it was delicious. Quality ingredients for an under 15 dollars pizza? Yes please!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of pizza joints in Vegas, but THOSE GUYS PIES are the most authentic and well priced NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY east coast pie in clark county.

The crust is amazing and the ingredients are fresh.  

Cant wait for the next one I order !"}
{"text":"Having just moved here from NY, I was excited to see what kind of pizza places were around my apartment. After reading these reviews, Those Guys was an obvious front runner for being our local spot. 

We went in today, and the guy that helped was helpful, funny, and really laid back. He made us a half regular and half white pie, because he overheard my girlfriend and I debating which to get. 

When he was packing it up to give it to us, he said something to the effect of \"if you don't like that pie, you're crazy!\" .... But he's such a laid back guy that it came off more of quiet confidence and being friendly. Man though, he was right. 

They slather on garlic, which I happen to love. If you don't, perhaps this won't be the place for you. 

The regular pie was delicious, the sauce and cheese they use are SO flavorful. The crust was a bit soggy (we drove 10 minutes home), but man the flavor was so good I easily forgave some sogginess. 

The white pie was also really good, and had some great pockets of garlic. 

Needless to say, my girlfriend and I can't talk to anyone without eating ten pieces of gum, but man was it worth it! Great service, great pizza, great price!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  The dough was perfect!  As soon as I walked in the place I knew I'd be back. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"What a nice joint! I did not even try the pizza which is their specialty. The fingers for my son were amazing, hand breaded (saw him do it!), the fries were parmesian breaded, the wings crisp and sauces awesome. Everything was cooked fresh and high quality. Cheesesteak was moist and juicy.... will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem located in The Lakes development. Awesome food especially the chicken strips! Would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time at was impressed with the quality.   You can taste the quality in their ingredients, I had the white pizza which was really good and the three cheese fries.  I will be going back to try the cheeses steak next. There is one down fall is the lack of seating,  practically none, I mean only 1 table.  So If  planning on eating  here it's not going to happen,  you will have to take if home or eat in the car. The quality of the food and a great staff make up for the lack of seating.  I will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Quality pizza at it finest. Wish could have a little more sauce but I'm sure they won't have problem next time adding it! Oh, the area is fantastic!  Lived here 8 years and never knew a lake and trillion dollar houses are up her!"}
{"text":"The food is top notch, best pizza and cheese steaks around!  I've been to all of the other places some of the other people posting mention, Grimaldi's, Don DiMarcos, Roccos, Verazanos, etc., and NOTHING touches this place!!  The customer service is outstanding and their delivery is usually pretty quick.  I highly recommend, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza and the owner (the guy that was on Triple D) was also in the shop and he was super friendly and nice. We gave 4/5 because the pizza was pretty messy n the center was slightly uncooked but over great quality of toppings and tasted great."}
{"text":"Those Guys Pies have never failed. They have never disappointed me. I noticed here 3 years ago and this has quickly become my favorite pizza place.  They are generous with their portions and their prices are fair. Their delivery is fast and I recommend them to everyone I know. My favorite pizza is their meatball pizza.  I've had their Lake  Side Salad and their house  salad.  All I can say is....drool! Delicious and very fresh. I am pleased that they are always more than I expect."}
{"text":"Great customer service, huge pizza pies, nice people , met the owner very cool guy, great hidden gem to las vegas"}
{"text":"Just ordered online so hopefully our order will be correct & delicious - will let u know!
How unfortunate, yet again this place that used to be great completely missed the mark. Asked for wings & pizza extra crispy - both couldn't be any soggier -
HERE'S A TIP FOR YOU GUYS-
When dealing with fried foods - always ventilate the styrofoam so steam doesn't ruin the crispness of the food DUH
I'm pissed! No bags to put the wings in & sauce them - no center piece on pizza preventing the lid & cheese touching 
The fries sucked for the same reason as the rest of the food - no ventilation & so now after spending $55 on food I'm standing at my oven cooking trying to revive the food I paid for. 
Also check out the pic of the wings & notice the sauce on the right - ventilation again would've prevented this tragic mistake ..
Friggin disgusting - NVR AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I ate the Italian white pie for the first time. I was very skeptical UNTIL i ate it. Wow such a different style pizza but so so so delicious. Definitely will be eating it again. I can't wait to try more food from this place."}
{"text":"Great quality food! This place is off the beaten path but well worth it! The chicken fingers are beyond addicting and the cheesesteaks are delicious! Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"We came here to order some pizza and mozzarella sticks. The guy behind the counter told us that they don't sell mozzarella sticks but he offered to make us some. We were surprised and I thought, \"That's awesome customer service!\". 

 On my side of the pizza I ordered bacon, Jalapeno, and Pineapple. While we were driving home the smell of the pizza was intoxicating! I couldn't wait to have a slice!  When we opened the pizza it was a bit greasy but we dabbed it with a paper towel to take off the access grease before we ate any of it . It was tasty!  The mozzarella sticks made from scratch were also delicious! 

I'd like to comeback here and try more of their menu like the Philly Cheese Steak I've been hearing so much about!"}
{"text":"It is so hard for East Coasters to find authentic NY Style pizza. This place has it. The crust has the same taste and texture, not sure how they do it, it's perfect. 
The Works chicken steak was amazing. Just like I get in Philly. 
We will be back here for sure. 
Tonight we had the 18\" cheese pie, the works chicken steak and the cheese fries. All great. 
They have a few tables to sit in, but this is mostly a carry out or delivery place. 
We sat in (party of three) and the people working there were great. Nice and friendly. We left an extra tip for the great service.
I learned about this place on DDD and I was not disappointed. We are back and forth from the east coast and vegas regularly and we will be sure to visit this place again. We are in Southern Highlands so it's about a 20-25 minute drive. Well worth the drive for sure.  
I highly recommend this place, especially for East Coasters missing that authentic taste we grew up with!"}
{"text":"Spot was really good. We ordered late & we were able to get the free cinnamon bites due to spending $25. No complaint on my end. lol. Pizza had a good taste to it. Mozzarella sticks were def on point. We saw this spot on Trip D so you know we had to check it out. All in all, place was good."}
{"text":"I have to say that the pizza was good when fresh but terrible reheated! We ordered the meat pie and the Italian white pie. The meat pie was delicious because honestly how could you go wrong with extra meat. I probably wouldn't get the Italian white again; I would go with something else next time, it was a little bland. 

This place is a little hidden inside the Lakes community. If we go back I'll order a small pizza next time  so that there aren't  leftovers. I for one like next day pizza but  but not from this place. The pies weren't great but they were not bad either."}
{"text":"good pizza.....I got the \"meat pie\" (sausage, peperoni, meatball, bacon), and it was delish. It was the thin foldable crust that I am starting to appreciate more. I got mine to go, and I don't think I would ever want to dine in, as the there was just barely enough room for a few tables, and the whole place was hot from the oven."}
{"text":"Saw this on Diners, Drive-in & Dives and had to try this amazing Philly Steak as seen on the episode.  I lived in Philly for 6 years, I love cheesesteaks and thought the drive would be worth this one since it looked so amazing on the episode.

The place is very small only 2 tables with 6 chairs each.  One table was taken when I got there so the space was very limited to even sit at the other table.  All that being said they have a great selection and can really put out food as a majority of the place is kitchen.  The pizzas looked great and the people eating there said it was awesome.

This probably would have been definitely 4 stars if not 5 but unfortunately the guy who took my order and made my steak, I specifically asked for no mushrooms and he put mushrooms on the sandwich which I did not know until I got home.  So unfortunately I cannot write a review on the food as I could not eat this sandwich.

Sad people charge you $12 for anything and cannot pay attention to allergy requests or make something the way you ordered it.  It's also sad to drive all the way across town just to throw the food you paid for in the trash.  The guy even repeated my order, NO MUSHROOMS but still put them on the sandwich.  Very disappointed.."}
{"text":"A ok by me not worth fifty bucks for two pizzas and wings. taste good but I probably wont order again unless I get a good coupon  and im not a coupon shopper!"}
{"text":"Since I've never been to Philly because the airport doesn't count, I can only say that this is the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten in my life. Sadly, no pictures were taken due to my ravenous appetite. 
We also had the chicken tenders and those are amazing also. Not everyday you find food that's breaded in house and flavorful on its own. 
I truly can't wait to go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Best hi in town!! I would give it five stars but there's no place to sit down and eat and have a cold beer with it! But it's delish!!"}
{"text":"I come from the north east, home of New York style pizza, so I have had a few slices in my day and let me tell you, this is as good or better than anything I can recall having back home!  

Place is a bit hidden and as the previous reviewer noted; no point of sale system set up just yet but if you like pizza you MUST go here. 

The pizza is spectacular!  I tried a slice walking to my car and had to eat another before even I pulled out. 

I'm trying to save enough to take a picture of to post here..."}
{"text":"It took a long time for my pizza to arrive longer than I was told.  But the pizza and the salad were very good!  And the pizza was still hot when it came-YES!  I am tired of cold pizza."}
{"text":"i went for the first time the other day and the philly cheese steaks are amazing!!!! only thing missing is a sign on the building, i almost left because i was having a hard time finding the place."}
{"text":"This is a bold statement but this is the best pizza that I have had anywhere. The crust is crispy and chewy and very thin and still the bottom holds up without getting soggy and I had a 20 minute drive to get it home. I had a pepperoni & Italian sausage pie. The sauce is not overly sweet and compliments the other ingredients. A must have in the Las Vegas area. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak sandwiches I ever had out west! Non greasy real beef your choice of cheese etc. we eat in and delivery is fast portions are generous! Try all their food I'm sure the won't disappoint! Ribeye cheesesteak your choice of chicken too! We ordered cheesy fries for a friend that was visiting Loved it Caesar salad was huge you'll need to add a extra dressing! Besides the fact they've been on DDD\"s the food is great! Keep in mind it is a lounge pickup once if I remember I sat at the bar till my food was ready overall it is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Went in because we saw it on DDD. The owner told us they had sold out on so much, we wanted the sandwich but settled for the Pizza. It was ok, nothing spectacular. 

So we went back for the sandwich a few days later. What a disappointment! I have now visited 4 places DDD recommended. Only one is the real thing. This place isn't one of them. I won't go back."}
{"text":"We decided to try those guys pies because we saw it on triple d. Even though the are from Jersey, I would give them a fair shake. I'm from Brooklyn and the pizza spot I love out here closed. I really wanted to like them but i did not. it wasn't nasty pizza, way better than commercial but just ok. I will not come back here again"}
{"text":"The best philly west of Chicago and the best vegetarian sandwich in the entire universe. It's no longer on the menu but they still have all the ingredients to make it. Stuffed with tomatoes, artichokes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, broccoli rabe, possibly spinach, some sort of garlic oil and cheeese on the perfect soft pillowy bread. I get it with mozz. The cinnamon poppers with the cream cheese icing are unreal. I've only had delivery and they always deliver before promised time."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, the yelp reviews let me astray on this one.
 I ordered delivery- and I know it's a Saturday but I think an hour and fifty minutes is too long to wait for delivery. The pizza was OK. We had the white and the big sexy. Super garlic flavor and crust is just a little too thick and chewy. I'd rather go to my regular Rocco's for NYC style pizza.
The customer service and delivery person  were super nice... it's just a no for me."}
{"text":"We tried two of the pizzas and a cheesesteak.  Everything was great.  It's a small place for dining in, so I recommend doing the take-out option."}
{"text":"We heard about this little place a few months ago on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. It was about 5 miles from the strip but well worth the drive.  

I expected a larger sit down restaurant but there were only 3 tables.  I think they do more pick up and delivery.  But no worries, our scrumptious BBQ chicken with sweet onion pizza was made within 10 minutes.   We got it to go because it was rather hot inside with the large ovens.  

We found a nice little park nearby and enjoyed our pizza immensely.  

There were many selections in the menu.  Pizza, sandwiches, salads and appetizers.

The workers were singing and joking the whole time.  It appeared they enjoyed their jobs."}
{"text":"A great pie and without a doubt the best philly I've ever eaten. All the staff are super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Waste....The pizza was soggy, ughhhh and the Philly cheese steak  was an oniony disaster, I usually give a place 2 dining experiences before I review it, but this place doesn't deserve a second chance, I'll stick with the pizza at Cosmopolitan and if I want a good sandwich I'll make it at home."}
{"text":"So amazing! I just moved in down the street and Those Guys Pizza is shizznit! Love the spinach salad.  Super friendly staff.  The have made me a happy pizza filled camper."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheesesteaks in town. Authentic!!! If you're from PA./N.J. you'll know what I mean. 
The pies are excellent too. I recommend the sausage and mushroom. Thanks for bringing the East coast to the desert!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. We wish they had a little more seating, but enjoyed the restaurant. The next time we are in the area, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"great cheese steak which is pulverized prime rib but the pizza is nothing special but there are an abundant amount of toppings.  We had a large veggie pizza that had almost no sauce on it. It is a good pizza but i will not go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"We just tried them. We are always looking for good NY style pizza here which is hard to find in LV.  We lived in NJ for 8 years and it was pretty close. I'd love to see the chicken parm pizza they make back in NJ on the menu.   Thx for the free cinna popper things, we all enjoyed them and will order from them again."}
{"text":"Always great food at Those Guys Pies. Hands down, the best Philly Cheesesteak in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Well where do I start........my family being from Italy off the boat......I do enjoy my pizza. Shortly after moving to Summerlin  from back east for my job I was blessed to find perhaps the best pizza in Vegas.  I'm a dedicated customer and loyal to what I find......that being said I have been here for 2.5 yrs and after seeing Those Guys on Triple D......today after work I thought what the hell.....I'll give it a try.  After all the Triple D show made this place look so so good..........Well....another review used the phrase \"train wreck \"......lol.....I think I was in the caboose of that train as it came off the tracks !
   I took a friend there......very small......very ! .......we ordered 2 salads , 1 pizza , an order of wings and had 2 iced teas out of the cooler. We had to ask for a couple glasses and ice....no straws.....then after waiting and no offer of even water....out comes the pizza.....then the salads....then wings.......timing was just awful ! The salads  came in a to go container.....it was just ok....just thrown together and to much crappie dressing dumped on top. The pizza......well....Dajorno would have been an improvement  !!!!! Awful taste.....crappie crust ! Then the wings....omg.....plain old wings deep fried in a basket and 2 little plastic to go cups with dips. I have to say.......the WORST wings I've ever had !!!  
  I should have known better......most Triple D places I go to are dumps and poor food, and this place was no different!  Save yourself the gas and stomach and forget this place. I will stick with my fav Vegas pizza.....Dom Demarcos. .....now that's some good pie !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The best pizza in town!! I will strongly recomend getting the BBQ Maui Waui it is not too spicy it is just right!!
Also the wings are big and perfectly cooked.
I have been here a few times and service is always great and they have the food ready for pick up in a very timely manner.
Price are a little bit higher than normal but you really get what you pay for your pizza!!"}
{"text":"Well, well, well my wife and I have found/discovered the best tasting *PHILLY STEAK* ever!!!!! Can you say PRIME RIB!!! OMG! We met one of the owners name Chris. Chris took the cake!!! I give them 3 FFF's Friendly Fast & Fun
Price - good
Taste - great
Service - phenomenal

WE NEED THIS PLACE IN NORTH LAS VEGAS!!!!!

Returned this time with the family and once again Chris was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"After seeing them on TV, very disappointed that it really isn't a dine in place. Evening brings in hordes of bugs BUT the pizza was great. I really love NY style pizza and this place hit the spot. We had their cheese and beef pizza, which is something I normally don't order and I'm in love with it. Great flavor!
The chicken fingers were really, the best as they say. Coating was light and crisp, and chicken was hot and fresh.
Wish they were closer to me!"}
{"text":"I love TGP their salads are  really good,  I recommend the house salad. I'm not a pizza person but i like chicken fingers with F...YOU sauce  ...yeap thats the name I guess because is super hot;  yummy  french fries and yummy  meat and cheese with everything sandwich . Delivery is fast and the Chef/owner is a nice guy. I love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome cheese steak. Best in town. My go to place whenever im in vegas."}
{"text":"Thanks DDD!

This hidden gem has been on my to do list for the past few months (of course I saw this pizza joint on Diners Drive Ins & Dives)!!! The aroma was amazing from the moment I walked in and the hospitality followed. I was able to order half/half pizza which is fantastic because I was able to try the Maui Wowie & a White Pizza. The pizzas were delicious, loved the Cinnamon poppers & the fries were nice and crisp. I enjoyed conversing with the owner as well he was super hospitable and didn't have any problem answering the same questions that I'm sure he's asked a million times a day about Guy and the overall experience. As a local I will definitely return and conquer the Philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from these guys for what seems to be forever!  The cheesesteaks are amazing ... and I'm from Philly, so I know cheesesteaks!  The pizza is also great -- thin crust and done right.  Chicken fingers - freshly cut and breaded (MUST try Pineapple Buffalo sauce).  For a while, they didn't deliver to my area, so I was bummed, but now DoorDash gets them to my house.  Absolutely, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Pizza, wings, and salads galore.  Great food if you live in or around the area.  I must admit, I have high standards when it comes to Pizza being that I'm from Chicago.  All in all this place is holding it down.  The wings were juicy and delicious, salad was fantastic and the pizza was pretty good.  Those guys sure now how to make food :-)"}
{"text":"Saw this place on DDD and decided to check it out since we were in the neighborhood.  Did not disappoint!!  You could tell by the line out the door that the food was going to be great.  We got the BBQ Maui Wowie and it was divine!  Great flavor!  Can't wait to go back to try the Cheesesteak!  Thanks Guy Fieri!"}
{"text":"Good pizza for a decent price. 
Delivery showed up in a timely manner as well."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago to order a pizza to go.  We ordered the meat pie and when I told the manager (?) that I lived in Henderson (about a 20-25 min drive), he told the pizza makers to only cook the pizza until it was 90% done and box it for me.  He told me that when I get home to put it in the oven for another 5-8 minutes and it would be done.  That is exactly what I did and the pizza was delicious!!  I appreciated the manager accommodating us that way...very nice!!!  We waited outside by the lake and watched the sun set as the pizza was being prepared.  There is not a lot of seating so I would suggest ordering your pizza or meal to go.  I think they said that they were moving to a larger place.  We will be back to try some other items on their menu when we are in the area."}
{"text":"As a former resident of both New York and New Haven, I have avoided pizza in Las Vegas because I generally ended up disappointed when I didn't.  But with the election season--the four debates and election night--I was craving pizza to eat while glued to the television. After seeing the \"Those Guys Pies\" mention in 89117 Magazine, I checked Yelp and decided to try them. We ordered takeout last night--one meatball/onion pie and one Italian white pie. I was thrilled to find that both were delicious. Tasty toppings, tasty crusts. I still know I'm not back East, but, for once, I was not disappointed. I'm glad that I now have go-to pizza, and it's even close to home."}
{"text":"That was THE BEST cheesesteak sandwich I've eaten.  Warning - if you like sandwiches on the dry side this one isn't for you.  But if, like me, you love your cheesesteak to be juicy and delicious then you might want to check this place out.
Had half a sandwich with provolone and half with whiz.  Both with onions.  I'd go with the Whiz.  I used to prefer my cheesesteak with provolone but after eating this delicious whiz sandwich I see why those fellows in Philly love the Whiz.
Some seriously good eats."}
{"text":"I've been twice now. Once I got the Big Sexy pizza and it was absolutely amazing! I'd wager this is the best pizza in town. The second time I ordered a chicken cheesesteak and a Philly. I was not disappointed. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu and the owner works his butt off, but will bullshit with you also."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic. The sausage and bacon on the pizza was so flavorful. The cheese fries are crispy and super cheesy. We had the ribeye cheesesteak sandwich. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Seen these guys on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Being a huge Philly cheesecake fan I definitely had to try them out. The chicken Philly is the best Philly I've ever had!! Make sure you have them add onions, and mushrooms. Worth the couple extra dollars. Staff is very friendly. My reasons for a 4 out of 5 stars was the seating and no restrooms. They only have two tables. There is outdoor seating by the lake for all surrounding businesses. Great on a nice day. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were on a mission to try this well hidden gem. its tucked in a small strip mall tucked in a housing development . Its the real deal the meats are so good. I have had bacon on a pizza before but not like this and homemade sausage. If your in Vegas and would like to get away from the hectic strip area take the drive. Very small dine in area but if its a nice day down at the end of the strip mall there are tables and chairs with a lake view"}
{"text":"Got a flyer for this place and decided to try it out based on all the 5-star reviews and the fact that it's so close to home. I have to say it was pretty darn good. I had an original cheesesteak which was very tasty. I'm not sure it was 5-star tasty, I'll have to try some more stuff (pizza) before I give them that additional star. Service was very fast and friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Starting off a late night of boozin!  We wanted something quick, easy, and FILLING to soak up all the alcohol, and my long term Yelp bookmark delivered the goods!

Ordered an Original Ribeye Cheesesteak ($11): Grilled Onions and Cheese Wiz. This was a large portion and pretty tasty! The meat was minced up very finely but was JUICY and had good flavor. The grilled onions were perfect...sweet, and not very distracting from the meat and cheese. Wish they were a little heavier on the WIZ, but overall a solid philly steak!

Three Cheese Fries ($5). This was a large serving and was DRENCHED in cheese...awesome! I split the cheesesteak and fries with Eva, and we still weren't able to finish everything! 

They only have a tiny table with 3 chairs or so inside.  Probably should do take-out here, but we ended up eating inside since we were in a hurry.

I'll be back to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"They make their own bacon...that is all! Their pizza is very east coast! Even the inside is very much like a pizza place you would go to on the east coast. I haven't tried anything else they make yet, because I can't get past the pizza with bacon...but I'm sure it's all good!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza! Greasy and extremely short on toppings (which is ok because the toppings were bad).  The only good comment I have is that they delivered in 30 min."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. Also would recommend the steak subs are the best extremely well seasoned."}
{"text":"First time here and very disappointed. I've had better pizza at Domino's. The crust was hard and chewy. The sauce was bland and nothing special. I called the my order in and was told 15 minutes. It took me 15 minutes to get there and I still waited another 20 minutes. While waiting I looked around. The place is disgusting and dirty. The ceiling fan hasn't been cleaned in months,  there was cobwebs on the ceiling, the walls  in the kitchen were dirty. I have no idea how the Health District could give them an A rating. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Now i understand why this place was featured on Fuy Fieri's show. The pizza here is bomb! we ordered the Meats pizza and it was bomb! The meats and ingredients in this pie is very fresh and the cheese is stringy which i enjoy when it comes to cheese on a pizza.  The proportions of cheese, meats, sauce, to dough ratio was perfect in every bite. We also ordered the philly cheese steak fries and that was very good as well. I feel like this pizza joint is one of the best in vegas and will strongly recommend it to anyone who is craving pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, with over the top service. We arrived unknowingly arrived prior to opening this morning, and they were happy to make us our cheese pizza. Which was great, because my son wanted pizza, and he would have been late for school if we had to wait until 11!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  Had the BBQ Maui Wowie and the Lake Side Salad.  The crust was not too think not too thin, the bacon was cooked to perfection.  All the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor.  Definitely more of a take out place but location does have 2 tables.  It's worth eating there to get hot and fresh.  I would go back in a heart beat.  Everything in the salad was delicious and I loved the pita that it came on top of."}
{"text":"3rd time in a row I was told my pizza would be ready in 15-20 minutes, when I get there it's always a wait. Called ahead to order for pick up, was told it would be 15-20 minutes, I get there in 25 minutes, and my pizza hadn't even been put in the oven. The kid at the front assured me it would only be 10 minutes, well it took another 25 minutes. I got a car full of groceries and frozen food, as well as a tired and hungry, crying, infant. I understand if it's buisy, but don't lie to people and tell them 15-20 minute wait, when it's more like an hour. good pies, HORRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Big Sexy. Lots of glowing reviews? I knew we were in trouble when I had to lower all the windows to stop my eyes from burning. A bottle of Pinot couldn't temper the garlic powder! A bottle of IPA faired no better. Since there were no other such complaints I will try it one more time, maybe. Sadly this pie ended in the compost bin!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've ever tasted from the west coast ! The owner knows the struggle of finding east coast food and knows the tricks and trade to bringing the taste of the east to the west."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and I gotta say that it was so good!!! Got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, fries and a drink. The sandwich was awesome, and it was very big. The fries were enough for two people. Super friendly service and all around great experience. Cant wait to go back and eat again."}
{"text":"Very delicious!!!  I was referred by my new marketing company and since my staff and I are pizza lovers and have a particular taste bud for authentic pizza!  Those Guys Pies was fantastic.  I had called in for delivery to my office my staff being supper excited for lunch we ordered a cheese pizza, fingers and cheese steak.  I had to pick up the order because my office is just outside the 5 mile mark (I am 5.2 miles out) but I said to try a new pizza location is well worth a drive and the guy on the phone seemed exceptionally nice and apologetic.  

When I got to the location it was easy to find the staff was very friendly I like being called by my name, telling me have nice day NAME. Just don't get that enough out here in Vegas. 

Now the details of the delicious food!!!   The Cheese Steak has to be my favorite it was delicious, perfect amount of cheese and the steak OMG melted with so much flavor not chewy leather that I find everywhere else in this city.

The chicken fingers are my brothers fav in the city, fresh different and tasty he said and he would be the expert in this department lol.  

The pizza reminded me of the east coast flavor which I miss being from Boston.  The spices, cheese and sauce all such a tasty combination and the dough was perfect thickness for my liking, hand tossed always the way to go if you like the mom and pop feel and fresh maid daily taste.  

Overall I rate a 5 out of 5 because the service was exceptional, food was hands down tasty and enjoyed every bite.  I will order from here again I can not wait to try out other menu items.

Thanks!!"}

Located at The Lakes and described as \"a labor of love to create the best for the best,\" Those Guys Pies had long been a member of the Las Vegas 'to-do' list and with business nearby on Friday afternoon a visit was planned the day prior, online ordering allowing pickup orders to be placed in advance with an 11:20am default setting.

Cited by trusted sources as \"good pizza in an inconvenient spot,\" the latter lament an accurate description for pretty much anything at The Lakes, Those Guys Pies is tucked away in a small shopping center on Lake East Drive and with minimal signage plus limited seating the restaurant operates mostly as a grab-n'-go option for local residents, the \"wait times approximate\" as was demonstrated by an 11:40am order readied just four minutes before noon.

Visited by Guy Fieri for Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, this fact obvious as Chef Roy Bass plays the DVD on a television in-house, Those Guys Pies looks to set itself apart from other pizzerias by focusing on quality products and a philosophy of doing as much as possible within the small kitchen, roots in Jersey and reference to Tacconelli's giving those familiar hopes that may be a bit over-inflated, though the Philadelphia icon is certainly not a bad target at which to aim.

Running just a three man crew, the wait times not conducive to those with only an hour for lunch, it was at a small table alongside the man-made lake that lunch was enjoyed and although the oft-praised Maple Cheesecake was sold out the $28 tab nonetheless netted more than enough food to share, the half-and-half options for pies as well as sides allowing for a good amount of variety beginning with tender breaded mushrooms and a handmade Angus Meatball that featured almost no filler beneath mozzarella and bright marinara, the richness mellowed slightly by notes of garlic, basil and rosemary.

Watching the pizza get loaded into the oven at the time of my 11:39 arrival, the fourteen minute cook-time certainly not enough to render edges crispy as I stood, ignored, at the counter waiting, first bites of the red sauce slice showed good flavor but compromised crust texture and moving on to the \"Italian White Pie\" Special the results were equally mixed as the toppings were absolutely top-grade amidst pools of ricotta while the crust was starchy and flimsy with too much stretch.

Turning to desserts, the Fried Dough with Cinnamon, Sugar and a sidecar of sweet topping complimentary with Social Media Check-In, Those Guys Pies apparently brings the cheesecakes in from an outside source who makes these only for them and with the daily delivery not yet arriving tastes were instead invested in freshly made cannoli with a sturdy shell that shatters into creamy mascarpone dotted with chocolate chips, not as good as those at Naked City or Elements, but a heck of a lot better than the prefilled disasters people wait in line for at Carlo's Bakery.

***While the issues noted make me question the \"Good pizza\" portion of the \"inconvenient spot\" quote there is no doubt Those Guys are working with good product, the desserts and appetizers all excellent even before considering the bargain pricing compared to local competitors."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, love the service. I'm so glad small businesses like this still exist! Reminds me of home"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.

Pizza is an AWESOME NY style pizza. No ground beef on the pie here! Sliced meatballs all the way. 

Chicken fingers are very good as well. Garlic Fries were sensation. 

Cheesesteak is another homerun on the menu!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews of their cheese steak and it did not disappoint.

The steak wasn't overly salty or peppered. It was juicy and tender and succulent. I got my sandwich with mushrooms and cheese whiz.

The store is very small and is definitely not a dine-in place. I suggest calling to order ahead for pick up, although my sandwich was made on the spot and didn't take long to get.

The price tag was a little hefty, but it is definitely the best in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food, closest I've had to the real Philly deal. The last time they delivered they made a mistake on our sandwich and I called to complain. They put a credit on my account, and when I called tonight they made good on it. We are not people to complain out of nowhere, so it was nice to see customer service given when it is legitimate. We highly recommend the wings and the amazing cheesesteaks wit' whiz of course! Cheers"}
{"text":"Ok im live by philly . Have had most of the cheese steaks . On our way to vegas we stopped at pat and genos in philly for cheese steaks ... these cheese steaks we 1000x's better .... pizza just like in NY  .... diners drive inns and Dives place and it lives up to it"}
{"text":"This place is spectacular, I stop in every time I am in  Vegas. The Big sexy is revolutionary its a  must try!  loads of garlicky goodness !! the Philly cheese steak is Delicious; I loath mushrooms and in this sandwich I devoured them !! definitely a must !!! I try to visit as frequently as I can !!"}
{"text":"Ummmmm yes please. We had pizza and wings delivered from Those Guys Pies tonight for the first time. Half way through the meal we were so angry with ourselves for wasting time ordering from all the other places. So. Good. The pizza was really good, but the wings were AMAZING. They send the sauce separately (we ordered mild and parmesan garlic) from the wings with baggies so you can toss them yourself. My wife said \"these are the best wings I've ever had\".  No joke. 

Give this place a try. Now. Fair price and really good food. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"After playing in the snow up Mount Charleston, we decided to give Those Guys Pies a try.
Called it in for pick up since we knew from other Yelpers they have only 1 table,  polite easy ordering via phone. The pizza place wasn't too hard to find, it's tucked away behind Citibank off of West Sahara.  I'm sure they don't get too many drive by customers though.
I've been wanting to try their Cheesesteak Pie since I've heard about them. With the red sauce, No shrooms we don't dig the fungi. The staff was very friendly and chatted with my husband while we waited for the pie. They give you little cups of oregano, garlic, red peppers and grated cheese with your pie. 
The pizza was delicious, not my favorite in town but a contender. Loved the crust, it had tons of cheese and was close to an actual cheesesteak taste. My only complaint is their red sauce, I was glad the pizza didn't have a lot of it. I just wasn't a big fan, can't quite put my finger on why.  But I'm weird with my sauce preferences. Prices are about on track with most quality pizza places.
Can't wait to go back, Looking forward to trying their white pizza and original cheesesteak which I'm hearing good things about."}
{"text":"My brother convinced me to finally go here since he's a die hard everything PHILLY FAN. He kept saying how great this places cheese steak was and I finally went and omg!!!!! Best Philly cheese steak with wiz & (with works) EVER!!! I am amazed and very happy with their food!!! My belly is too! Yummm!"}
{"text":"I have been with them since they opened. They now have added spinach to their menu and the Veggie pizza that I had the other night was the best in over 10 years. Their food has always been good, but they have stepped it up.  Way to go, guys!  (High praise from one raised in New Haven, CT)"}
{"text":"Important to note that we got delivery so I can't comment on quality or service at the actual location.  We ordered a big sexy pie and some fingers with sauces totaling about $35 with tip.  The pizza was so oily that it had run through the box and was oily underneath. The pizza itself was fine, not great not terrible, but the crust was a joke.  Because of all the oil it was super flimsy and almost impossible to eat since it kept flopping all over.  The chicken fingers were fine, and the sauces were interesting (if not necessarily good... maple mustard wasn't a winner)

It was fine overall, but we probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Well we heard all the raves about this tiny order out pizza parlor, even saw the Diners, Drive in and Dives episode. We ordered a half Margherita and half White Ricotta pizza. The crust was very good, however the Margherita was really just regular cheese and the White Ricotta pizza was missing those iconic globs of Ricotta. It was bit heavy on the garlic, however all in all a decent pizza. It's certainly not the best I've had. My rating was a gift, my understanding is they are well known for their Philly Cheese sandwiches and they like what they do. My favorite is still Bambino's"}
{"text":"Pizza is definitely good not that best I've had but that cheesesteak is outta this world hands down the best I've had in this town and the cheese fries are a hot would've given 5 stars but the owner or manager was scolding an employee and its a small place so we all could see and hear"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and wings and was very pleased with the service and food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was watching Guy Fieri on Triple D and I saw that he came to this spot so I decided to try it out. Sadly, it was not as great as it seemed on TV. The service was great, I was greeted immediately and the cashier was very polite. Everything went downhill when I got my pizza. 
The place itself is very small with only 2 tables, so there's not much room to sit and eat. I ordered the meat pie and it took about 15 minutes. I was so excited to eat it since I was starving so I just found a table and decided to try a slice before leaving. I picked it up and it was pouring oil onto my paper plate that I could see through it. Immediately after that, all the toppings literally slid off the pizza and fell onto my plate so I'm just holding the crust at this point. Did they dump the whole jug of oil onto my pizza or something? I sort of lost my appetite at this point. I tried to take some napkins to dab the oil off and try to salvage what was left. I ended up eating whatever plopped onto my plate and gave the rest to someone else. Sadly, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered their  \"cheese steak pizza\" No onions, no peppers, barely any mushroms. If this is how they make food when they are not  that busy (per cashier) i wonder how food comes out when they are. Not ordering again"}
{"text":"Update:

The chicken fingers are ridiculously good. The cheesesteaks are ridiculously good.

And Those Guys Pies goes above and beyond when it comes to making it right for their customers.

This is a business that has earned my loyalty through a quality product and more importantly through the hard work that they put into ensuring their customers' satisfaction.

Keep up the good work, guys."}
{"text":"Veggie pizza was great, fresh ingredients and just the right amount of chewy and crispness to crust!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Located in the lakes neighborhood they offer New York style pizza that is to die for... we order from them every time we want a nice cheese pizza.. also I recommend their chicken wings  I get them crispy.  And they are so delicious."}
{"text":"Had the cheesesteak and dont see the big deal.  Bread was very soft and soggy on the bottom due to the grease.   It was still good, but wouldnt go out of my way to get one.  People on here say they sell slices but they told me they didnt when i went in there"}
{"text":"Tried them out using online ordering and delivery. Ordered 2 pizzas, fingers & fries. A bit more expensive, but we figured it would be worth it. Pizza was ok, a little cold for my taste. Chicken fingers are not presauced and one was undercooked. Fries were in a plastic tub with a lid, which made them very soggy. Sad because this place had decent reviews."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at this place. The staff is always friendly and down to earth, and the quality of their pizza is top notch. It's a little on the pricey side, but it's worth the splurge. The crust is probably the best part, but it's honestly hard to say. The pies are also huge, so you really get what you pay for between quality, quantity, and service. Definitely a place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A truly worthy NY pie at home in Vegas. Guy from Diner's Drive In's and Dives didn't come here by chance. Great menu with lots of options and the Philly Cheesesteaks are awesome too! I'm a chicken fan myself and this Chicken Philly is right up there with the Pops Tops in Vegas. Those Guys Pies is Always good, and there's some deals out there to be found, especially if you have the Entertainment book. Enjoy folks...."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks in town and best fries. Exactly what you want from a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Saw it on Food Network, had to try it! We came here on a Wednesday night at about 8pm. Lots of happy customers outside the restaurant with their pizza boxes in hand. We were greeted by almost all employees as we walked in. Overwhelmed by the menu, we chose the \"Little Sexy\" sandwich and a cheese/pepperoni pizza. The totally was about $25. Not bad for a full sandwich and pizza. (Not a fan of \"fast food\" pizza.) 
The girl who rang us up was great. We took a seat, and noticed they have the episode they were featured on replaying on their tv! I'd be proud too, can't blame 'em. 
The owner (I'm guessing) dropped off our food. Everything looked fantastic. The sandwich was rich in flavors, but a little too spicy for me. Good thing my boyfriend ordered it. 
The pizza was cooked just right, and melted in your mouth. We were so pleased with the service and food that we decided to order another pizza to go for the family! Very happy with our visit here. Will be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"It's one thing to mess up an order but it's a whole other thing to mess it up twice! I'm kind of disappointed, I order from here quite often and normally they are right on!  I ordered a pizza whole pepperoni and on one half of the pizza I added olives and green peppers. The first time they delivered there was no pepperoni on the pizza only green peppers on one half and olives on the other half. I called and let them know and the guy on the phone repeated my order perfectly and said he would have another pizza out right away. When I got the pizza there was pepperoni on the whole pizza and on one half the bell peppers and the other half olives. My daughter doesn't like anything but pepperoni that's why I specifically said only on one half I wanted the extras. Anyways just a little disappointed"}
{"text":"I was butt hurt over a salad before but honestly, I friggin LOVE Those Guys Pies. The owner is awesome and the delivery guys are cuties. I'm in love with some Big Sexy. Tried to call in an order awhile ago and they were closed that day...for filming a TV show. Hmmm, must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives has never let me down. This pizza was awesome! If I lived in Vegas I would definitely make this a spot I would visit regularly."}
{"text":"A long time ago in a toxic waste dump far away called New Jersey, a young boy had his first pizza, a thin crusted thin crust pizza with fresh toppings all over it. It was heaven to that boy and for the last 20 years he has been trying to find a western region version close to that perfect bite.  Those Guys Pies comes awfully close.  Led by Roy Bass, who helped start Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, Those Guys Pies not only makes superb pizza but excellent cheesesteak (Roy hails from Cherry Hill, just a skimming stone away from Philly), and even homemade mozzarella sticks.  The ingredients are fresh and clearly Roy and his partner in crime put east coast love into their creations.

My one regret is they do not serve slices at night.  Still, leftover pizza will be good in the morning :)

Enjoy the pie with the transplanted east coaster Seal of Approval."}
{"text":"Great pizza pie! Only thing I would change is adding more dine in area, more tables. Plan to take it home instead. Over all yum!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing!!! I was craving a Philly cheese steak and this place happened to be closer then our usual capriottis, plus they served fries. So my husband and I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.. I don't know what these other people are talking about, the fries were probably the best part. My husband ordered the Italian Philly and I ordered a plain cheese steak, they were the most bland sandwiches I've EVER had. $30 for 2 sandwiches and an order of fries, I couldn't even force myself to finish HALF of my sandwich! We literally threw almost all of it away. Bread was soggy and even the Meat was soggy and flavorless!!! Next time I'll just take the extra few min car ride and go to Capriottis. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"This is the definition of Hole In The Wall.  There is seating for 12 if you squeeze tight.  The place is hard to find with no sign out front.  

The pizza is fantastic thin crust bliss.  There are some very unique creations like the cheesesteak and the Greek.  Hand crafted pizzas made with pride and absolutely delicious.   The sandwiches looked every bit as good and we will try them next time.  

This place was featured on Triple D and they have the episode playing looped on a TV with the volume too loud.  There is only so much Guy Fieri I can listen to before he gets on my nerves.  If I have a choice and the weather is nice, I would sit outside.  I will be back to this place again."}
{"text":"Heading home from a movie last night, my son and I decided that pizza would be a good choice for dinner and I steered the car towards Grimaldi's when I remembered that I wanted to try this place after reading about it on Yelp and Eater Vegas.  We always order the same pizza:  half mushroom for me, half pepperoni for him and we went with the regular size, which yields 8 slices.  There were no other customers in the 20 minutes or so that we were there around 8:00pm, but the service was friendly.  It's basically a store-front operation in the same Lakes plaza that houses the King & I Thai and Go Raw Cafe.  I don't know if it was because it was Sunday or what, but it was deserted at the whole place.  Regardless, the 10 minute drive home was difficult with the aroma of the pizza and two starving people in the same car.  The pizza itself was fine; my son and I agreed it was too greasy for our tastes.  Some people like that, but we don't.  Good crust, though.  In the end, I still like Grimaldi's and Dom De Marco's more."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the cheesesteak only...I lived in Philly for 3 years so of course this cheesesteak doesn't match up to Philly but it is still quite tasty. It's in the style and has the flavor of Jim's on South Street, not like Geno's or Pat's. I give it 4 stars for taste but I knocked it down a star because the sandwich is not that big (was still hungry after eating it) and it costs 11 bucks. Not a great value."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Vegas from the East Coast two years ago, I've been sorely disappointed with all the places claiming to have \"Philly Cheesesteaks.\" That's until I discovered this place. Those Guys Pies has the best cheesesteaks outside of Philadelphia PERIOD."}
{"text":"Holy pizza batman!!! They were featured on the Diners, Drive Ins and Dives on the food network. They need to be featured again. The pizza is all hand made from scratch and piping hot. The sauce is magical and the combo of that, the cheese, and the SUPERB customer service makes me believe in love at first sight (bite) again."}
{"text":"Cute little place and heard good things so we desired to try... Average ... It was decent but nothing to rave about .. Pizza just didn't have enough flavor for me even though they make a lot of things from scratch here.. Owner is super friendly though just wasn't my favorite :("}
{"text":"Not sure why, but even after ordering from here about 4-5 times I still kind of hesitate to write a review about Those Guys... it's like I can't quite decide about this place. Their pizzas are pretty good, have tried several combinations. Last being the big sexy which was surprisingly WAY spicy (too spicy for my husband to even eat any) and seemed like they skimped a little in the cheese department. The first time we ordered  I remember thinking the pizza was way too garlicky, which you if you know me you'd know that's almost an impossible feat to use too much garlic. Their wings are really good, but their sauces are what makes them great. I give their TGP sauce (sriracha aioli) 5+ stars, I was dipping everything in it, including my daughters chicken fingers and the mozzarella sticks LOL. On that note, their chicken fingers are really quite good. The first time we ordered they were way over seasoned with either italian seasoning or oregano, so I thought they were actually kind of gross, but this last time they were really very good. My husband had the philly cheesesteak and he said it was pretty good. I ordered the spinach salad time before last and it was a pretty big disappointment. There was so much slimy spinach, it was actually kind of hard to eat. I picked a lot of it out and ate what I could, so I think if they washed and checked their spinach and used a better dressing it would actually be a great salad - but I personally would not order it again. Their jalapeño peppers are good and have also had the shroom on white pizza which was good too. So all in all, I think it's a good pizza place. Nothing that screams great (except maybe the wings in TGP sauce) but I'm sure we'll be ordering here on a fairly regular basis."}
{"text":"This review is hard to write simply because the owner (?) righted the wrong. Here's what happened:
508PM -- We call Those Guys and order a large pizza. We asked how long the pizza would take to deliver since we needed to feed the babies (1 year olds). Roy let me know that the pizza would take about 15 minutes to cook and, since there was one delivery ahead of us, another 10 for the delivery. 25 minutes to go less than one mile, so we asked for delivery.
558PM -- No pizza. We called back to see if everything was ok with the delivery guy (we were hoping he hadn't been in an accident or anything) and was assured that the delivery guy would be at our door any minute.
612PM -- Still no pizza. We called again and were told that Roy was going to check up on his delivery guy. Something about car trouble.
625PM -- Still no pizza. This is now over an hour past the time we called to order. We called again. This was getting ridiculous and now the kids have already eaten something else. Here is where Roy kinda redeemed himself -- he said if the pizza wasn't at our house in 5 minutes, it was on him. Well, it wasn't.
645PM -- Our pizza finally arrived, with no apology from the delivery guy. Had we known it would have taken this long to get the pizza, we would have driven the 5 minutes ourselves to pick it up.

Now, the pizza. We ordered a large half cheese and half mushroom and olive. When it got to us, it was warm, not hot. This may have something to do with the mediocre taste. We only ordered from this restaurant because of the great Yelp reviews. But, given the time it took to arrive at our house and the blah taste factor, I doubt we'll order again. Maybe if we're desperate...."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've ordered from here and it is delicious. We got The Big Sexy and it is scrumptious. I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza which is what they have. It's not greasy and the sauce to bread ratio is great so the crust doesn't get soggy at all which is awesome. Definitely recommend very good. We ordered for delivery, they were here in maybe 15-20mins which is great time, and it was nice and hot, the delivery guy was too. Lol, no, but he was very nice. Very good place, reasonable prices for the quality you're getting. Definitely will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I were starving looking for something to cure our hangover blues. But everything was closed due to the holiday. So after process of elimination we chose this place. And I'm glad we did! When I ordered Roy was so pleasant and funny! The order didn't take very long to be delivered and everyone is surprisingly quiet during lunch-which is rare. Too busy stuffing our faces lol. Great food, large portions, and good quality!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!! My boss wanted to order lunch and he wanted to get little caesars, I couldn't stand for that. So I jumped on yelp and typed in our zip code and entered pizza delivery and picked the first thing that popped up, which was here. We got the big sexy not only because I sounded amazing but because thats all everyone talks about besides the cheesesteaks. It arrived very quickly and smelled oh so amazing so we chowed down. I was very surprised how large it was I was completely satisfied with one slice (they are very very large slices) I love how everything was evenly distributed, each slice had equal amounts. I was very impressed being from NY and all, the crust was amazing. I can't wait to check out other pizza from here and their cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"As a Sicilian who hails from Staten Island, I found the pizza here to be really good.  The location is a bit off the beaten path but close enough to get take out so no problem there. We only got plain cheese pies so cannot comment on other toppings. We will return...already hungry for more!"}
{"text":"I was really pulling for this place given the exposure on DDD but I was very disappointed. We ordered a large pepperoni, bell pepper and mushroom pizza, chicken fingers and fried mushrooms. When the delivery person arrived with the pizza bag, the pizza box was bending on both sides and the two bags were weighed on top smashing the pizza. I had to help her take the box out as she was pulling the box slanted almost upright. The fried mushrooms were smashed into a closed plastic box and two sauce containers were literally pushed down onto the mushrooms. It wasn't edible to say the least. We are disappointed at the $49.00 spent here. The two stars are for the friendly customer service over the phone.

Pizza was ordered on Saturday, April 30th, in the evening."}
{"text":"Got the OG cheesesteak, it's legit. The owner is cool, from Jersey born in south Philly. He definitely knows his cheesesteak. 

The bread they used is nice and soft inside but nicely toasted outside. The prime rib cuts is exceptional; juicy and flavorful. I tried it with the provolone and as you can see from my picture- it's nice and cheesey. Mmmmm so good... Get it with caramelized onions!

Will be coming back to try their chicken cheesesteak and some of their good looking pies!

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Seriously, Yelpers, listen to me NOW!!!  This is THE PIZZA PLACE IN VEGAS!  

We were looking to try a new pizza joint following a fun visit to our Vet on the westside.  I am sooo glad we chose this place!

It's located in the back corner if a strip mall in The Lakes.  I can only hope they expand and put another location closer to us, because this location is a little of a jaunt.  Believe me though, jaunt or no, we will be returning frequently!  If you want to sit and eat, there's a small table inside, or seats by the lake.  It's a beautiful view.  

Don't judge the food from the outside.  It is a small pizzeria, but it's all good!  We were immediately greeted and welcomed.  The place smelled so good!  I immediately thought of our fave pizza place in NYC!  Scrammed, bustling and packed full of deliciousness!  We decided to carry out The Works and the Meatball subs.  I don't think I can properly describe how good these subs were.  Forget any other sub shop!  The flavors were off the chain....homemade meatballs, need I say more??

We will most definitely be back to try the pizzas.  The white pizza has been calling my name.  Those Guys Pies just made customers for life!!!!!  This place belongs on our FAVE Vegas eats list!"}
{"text":"Been back here many times and have ordered delivery. Pizzas are still delicious but I find myself getting the cheesesteaks more often now because they are the best in town by a large margin. When we order in at work we usually split the cheesesteaks and get a slice of pizza each."}
{"text":"So good! If you plan on dining in just be aware that this is a very small place. But you will not be disappointed! I had a cheesesteak and it was INSANE! I ate the entire thing and I'm not sorry at all..."}
{"text":"Great White Pizza!  Great Philly Cheese Steak!  Staff was great and we chatted while I waited for my pizza!  I was driving quite a ways before I would get home to enjoy this delicious pizza, they told me to keep the lid cracked on the box so the crust wouldn't get soggy from the steam!  Yum!  Yum!  I cannot wait until they open one of these locations in Henderson!  I should also add the the guy who makes the Philly Cheese Steaks is from that area!  So they are legit Cheese Steaks!  :)"}
{"text":"My cheesesteak sandwich experiences are limited to my university's on-campus grill (American cheese oozing over a pile of grilled onions and beef on overly greasy cardboard, ahem, flavorless soggy chewy bread) and Amato's Cheesesteaks in the Bay Area. Amato's has a great reputation, but we always got it to go and it would be steaming in the paper wrapper for about 25 minutes. Fast forward to our trip to Las Vegas, where I read about Those Guys Pies in one of the Las Vegas magazines. Take a bite. Close your eyes. Chew and savor and repeat. This stuff is pure heaven, or at least I hope heaven is a place filled with delicious cheesesteaks and pies from Those Guys Pies. 

I ordered The Works Cheesesteak with a hug and photo-op. The freshly baked flavorful yeasty bread was stuffed with a ridiculous amount of deliciously marinated tender certified Angus beef rib-eye with grilled onions, mushroom, green bell peppers and white American cheese and then placed in the hot pizza oven for a crispety crunchety exterior and piping hot interior. Sooooo gooood. Amazing. Mind-blowing. Life-changing. And then there was the pizza. Thin and chewy high quality crust with crisp edges and lots of flavor (I hate bland crust), topped by the most amazing red sauce, delicious mozzarella cheese and yummy housemade sausage! Since we ordered a half and half, the halves were composed carefully, leaving a strip down the middle that did not have any meat or veggies.

We were going to eat once we got back to the house, but the smell was making me hungry, so we ate in the car instead. My lap was used as a tabletop; thankfully Las Vegas Weekly saved the super hot pizza from burning the top of my thighs. I burned my mouth on that piping hot first slice! After the searing pain, my taste buds encountered immense pleasure. Yummmmm. Hello, best ever pizza and cheesesteak in Las Vegas. Totes Amaze! You must try this place!"}
{"text":"On the hunt to find new wings to sample, I stopped by Those Guys Pies for pick up. I ordered wings with a number of different sauces, fried mushrooms and a cheesesteak with mushrooms.

They serve the wings plain and give you the sauces to season yourself. My favorite flavors were the pineapple buffalo and wasabi ranch. The fried mushrooms had a nice batter and were cooked well. They even stayed crispy after a long drive home. I was excited about the cheesesteak after hearing all the raves and I was a little disappointed. It was so greasy and was bland.

The wings were enough to draw me back and I look forward to trying their pizza on my next visit. The guys at Those Guys Pies were great and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza around. I've been there several times and it is always amazing. The shroom pizza is my favorite by far and the diablo is not far behind (has ghost pepper sauce.) The guys in the shop are super friendly and they are pretty quick as well. I've been to New York and this pizza blows theirs out of the water."}
{"text":"Ordered cheesesteak which was pretty good..ordered wings..nothing special..they don't toss them in the sauce..ordered a large pizza with tomatoes garlic and basil..picked up our order brought it home..the pizza was horrible..when u picked it up to take a bite it just flopped down..so I called and some guy answered and I told him the problem
.he said that's how pizza us supposed to me..so he argued with me for a few..put me on hold..and said ok bring the pizza back..which I did and got a refund..when I came in the guy from the back..maybe the owner I'm not sure..but I showed him..he even said that's unexceptable..and apologized and said pizza shouldn't be like that..also u guys need to teach the incompetent smart-ass how to deal with customers ."}
{"text":"Those Guys knows how to make a good ribeye cheesesteak hoagie. However, I like to know everything that will be on my sub. I don't get subs often so I forgot that some places generously sprinkle black pepper and oregano on top, and I didn't notice it on the menu. The quality of ingredients and quantity of meat was excellent, but the pepper and oregano knocked off a star for me. I ate half (washing it down with some tea), but the other half will be lunch for a family member. I will definitely order there again, but I will also remember to say no extra seasoning on top."}
