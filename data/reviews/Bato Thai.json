{"text":"The food is pretty good and the prices are very reasonable especially at lunchtime. Unfortunately I can't give it a very good score because the last few times I've been the wait has been very long ...you could be sitting there for 20 minutes before you can even get a glass of water I think essentially the issue is that they're understaffed it's unfortunate but quality of service is a big part of the equation when it comes to eating at restaurants."}
{"text":"This place knows how to do Thai and for a really great price too. The food is delicious and there are lots of options. The Bato Thai salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"Y'all can go ahead and close this place down.

I went there on a nicer summer day, a Sunday evening, the restaurant was not busy. 

Ordered 3 dishes with my group. Pad Thai, the nest, and curry. 

IT TOOK EXACTLY 50 MINUTES BEFORE OUR MAIN DISH GOT TO OUR TABLE. It was the same situation for everyone around us. 

Did you run out of rice?

Food was okay at best. Value is mediocre. 

When you host your friends and the restaurant under performs, it reflects badly."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and starving. This place had people in it and the menu looked decent, so we decided to give it a try. 

Ended up splitting the pad thai and the General Gao's chicken. Both were super saucy, but decent. I'd say for the amount of food you get it's a little on the expensive side. They do have a BYOB policy which is nice if you want to drink wine. Definitely not a bad place to eat, but there has to be better food around (though this is the only Thai restaurant I've tried in Montreal, so I can't accurately speak to that...). We sat for 10 minutes after they cleared the table waiting for the check, and then were told we had to go to the front to get the check and pay (which would have been helpful earlier)."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places to get Pad Thai. So flavourful without it being too oily. Love the extra veggies in it too. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Great comfort food. 

They now offer sushi and poke bowls. So fresh and amazing. Great combinations and options. I now find myself craving their poke bowls, its that damn good. 

Staff is also great and give great suggestions when you just don't know what to choose. Oh and best of all, it's a bring your own wine/beer."}
{"text":"Went there for take out and I like the place.   Great outdoor terrace during the warm months, ample indoor seating with booths and tables to choose from.

The menu had plenty of choices: sushi, rice, noodles, soup, salads, etc.   I decided to go for the Pad Thai which comes with chicken, shrimp and vegetables. 

I liked my meal.   It was nicely seasoned, well prepared, not very oily (I asked for low salt, low oil).  The chicken was tasty and moist.  

The staff was pleasant and smiley.   I would go back !"}
