{"text":"In the back of Viet Hoa (where Joe's Kitchen used to be), a new chef is serving quick, cheap noodle dishes. We stopped in for some sauteed wide rice noodles with beef and a bowl of noodle soup with shrimp. It's a pretty small menu, maybe 10 choices, with some standard stuff (e.g., the ubiquitous General Tso's Chicken) and some different stuff (a Crispy Crepe is intriguing). I think each dish cost $6 or $7. Ours were nice generous portions. The affable chef (Bopa? forgot to ask) says he's cooked in local Chinese restaurants for a while, but that his food's more Malaysian than Chinese. Both our dishes had a sweet/hot thing going on that made it impossible to stop eating.

The sauteed rice noodles had a savory oyster-sauce based flavor helped along with the chili pasted the chef says he makes himself, plus a handful of bean sprouts. Cooked in a flash over what must have been a ridiculously hot fire, as there was a nice bit of sear on some of the noodles. Good, but next time I'll ask for a more substantial portion of Chinese broccoli in it. The soup was great: a big pile of fresh round egg noodles swimming in a rich, red, shrimp-based sweet/sour broth. I'm going to ask for more broccoli in the soup next time, too. But I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is one of those authentic grocery stores with a small restaurant in back that I absolutely love finding, they can rival a dedicated restaurant. The place is in a small strip mall with plenty of off street parking. The place is one of the bigger Asian stores with a lot of variety from can, jar, fresh, frozen, boxed, bagged along with non food items. I found a bunch of new items to take home with me and try but I'm really here for the restaurant.

The restaurant is tiny with just two small tables and chairs with a similar menu as other Hmong grocery store restaurants. I dragged some friends here who have never had authentic Pho or anything on the menu except egg rolls so I ordered Pho, egg rolls, stuffed chicken wings and some sausage for a nice starter sampling.

The Pho was was very clean with just thin steak and sliced meatballs, no tripe or other meats/bones/cartilage that might weird out a first timer. The broth was tasty with no pools of oil like others, flavorful but not huge/over powering flavor. The garnish plate was fresh, it's all in the produce section on site and when you mix it all together its was very good. The sausage was very flavorful with that cup of green sauce. The stuffed chicken wings were very good also so try them at least once, I just wish I bought an extra cup of the green sauce because it's good on everything we had. This is really the perfect place for the first time Pho person vs head first into one of the crazy Pho places where you get a bowl with bones, skin, cartilage, tripe etc because you need to progress into that so your not turned off to Pho because it's a wonderful bright bowl of great flavors.

This was a great find with the authentic food which I would rather go to than a hipster Maddison Pho place. Overall the store in general is a great place to shop and grab some food. If you want to expand your authentic Asian food experience and try Pho, this is the place to start and see my pictures. A side note, it was very good but it didn't topple my go to place which has topped every place so far and I'm so glad it's in my city because I have been to so many good places that don't compare to places where I live. Good job."}
{"text":"Wonderful egg rolls and roasted pork. They serve the pork with an amazing, spicy sauce ( on the side). The prices are shockingly low!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Sometimes they can be hard to work with like if you want something that's only available on a weekend but at the end of the day they can do it because they make food that tastes good"}
{"text":"Solid place that is run by the former owners of Madison Oriental Market, now Hmong Legacy Market. They run a tiny eatery out of Viet Hoa Market with a small space for eating and pump out carry out eats. I have had the pho, decadent pork belly, the ginger enriched Hmong sausage, stuffed chicken wing, purple sticky rice, papaya salad, and turkey tails. The papaya salad can be tweaked to however funky or face melting spicy as you like it. The Hmong sauage is heavy fortified with fresh ginger kick and stuffed chicken wings are a tasty snack. They friendly staff are always smiley and ready to offer suggestions. Order the turkey tails with their homemade hot sauce that contains some real fish sauce funk and Thai chile burn for a true off the beaten path experience."}
{"text":"They are definitely in a groove now. Our kid got the pork belly and said the cracklings are melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Had a coworker not told me about this place, I would not have known about it! They at located in the back of Viet Hoa, which isn't necessarily the best location in my opinion. 

I ordered a bowl of pho, which was $6.95. It was really good! The bean sprouts that came with it were fresh from the grocery store, so that's one benefit of having a restaurant inside Viet Hoa. The broth of the pho was probably one of the better pho broths I've had in Madison. I recommend getting it! It's the perfect portion too.

We also ordered the Hmong Sausage for $3. I've never had a Hmong Sausage before so I have no idea what to compare it to, but I really liked it. It was full of flavor.

I had to knock a star for the Thai Iced Coffee. It was a sugar bomb. Also, it kind of tasted like the instant Thai coffees I've had in the past. Maybe I just didn't have good luck this time."}
