{"text":"Leo was an amazing server!! He was super accommodating and super patient!

The wait was a little long but the food was very good. The vegetable gyoza were the best part! I wish they would offer other types of noodles to substitute though."}
{"text":"average, expensive, crowded, small space, little bowl"}
{"text":"The decor is super modern and clean; be wary if you have a bony behind because the wooden benches aren't the comfiest, but let's be real, I'm here for the food after seeing Strings Ramen toting the title of being best-voted ramen in Chicago.

I came with my brother and we shared a gyoza appetizer; it was pretty disappointing, seeing that gyoza didn't taste made-in-house.  The taste reminded me of the bagged, frozen dumplings that you can buy from the grocery store.  Skip it!

We were nervous for what to come next, but the ramen was the redeeming factor in our meal.  I had the shoyu ramen with pork belly and my brother had the tonkotsu with pork and clam.

The shoyu broth was aromatic, flavorful, not overpowering, and I loved the texture of the noodles that were neither too soft nor too chewy. I ate this giant bowl in probably less than 10 minutes because it was that good.  The bamboo was well cooked and the egg's flavor cut through the broth. The tonkotsu was okay, but a little too salty for my tastes and I still prefer Morris Ramen's tonkotsu over Strings.  

Ramen is one of the best things to eat on a snowy day, and this bowl surely hit the spot.  I think Strings Ramen will be here to stay in Madison for a while."}
{"text":"My friend tried the Level 5 HELL RAMEN, it really burns! If you are a spicy challenger, this would be a good one. If youjust want to have fun, don't order this level please! The rice is really good. I would probably come back again to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Nice modern place. Not busy, got seated right away with the menu. Was greeted by our waitress and got a pitcher of water and 8oz plastic cups. Asked for straws but did not had any. Ordered the pork Sui Gyoza and Level 2 Hell Ramen. The gyoza came out steaming and was delicious, very soft. After 10 minutes got our ramen. Wow! The apperance was nice and looked amazing. Before stirring and mixing everything I tried the broth. Got my first spoon full and on top of the spoon the top layer of the spoon was filled with garlic/chili oil. I can handle my spice but that layer of oil just had me not drink any broth. (When I eat noodle soup dishes I like to eat broth with it.) The noodles firm and flavor was there. Like I said I felt like there was too much chili and oil but that's probably because it's a \"Hells Ramen\" the service was okay, not sure if it was pay at counter but walked up and our server did not handle our transaction, another waitress did."}
{"text":"Worst ramen I ever had before...
I was really interested in this restaurant because they said #1 votes ramen in Chicago. But, it was not taste good, noodles were sticky, and their soup was horrible(not hot as normal ramen). 
I tried to eat hell ramen level 4 and Miso, both were messed up. 
Appetizers were not variable, just poor. 
But, they sets prices so high... 
I think this restaurant is not real ramen restaurant. 
I strongly recommend you to go the other restaurants. 
I decided I am not going to go there anymore."}
{"text":"Three of us came over to try the new ramen restaurant in town and it was pretty good. We had the spicy crab miso and Turkey miso. The manager was quite friendly and the miso was really tasty. We waited 25 minutes to get in on a Friday night. They don't serve any alcohol including beer or sake. I'd recommend this to check out. One thing is for sure, you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"A group of seven of us came here on a Friday night. There was around a thirty minute wait which made sense considering the restaurant had just opened and it was a weekend night. We put our name down on the list and went over to Dotty's for a pre-dinner drink (I don't think Strings has a liquor license so no beers with your ramen). 

Our table was ready within 30-40 minutes and our server, Leo, provided very pleasant service. We ordered some pork gyoza for the table and they were okay, nothing amazing but we were all pretty hungry so it did the trick. 

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen, which is my go-to order when I'm trying out a new ramen place. If they can do this right, then I feel good about the rest of the dishes. The tonkotsu was yummy -- the broth was flavorful, the pork was well cooked, and the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The noodles were probably the least impressive part of the dish, they didn't quite have the texture I really like from ramen noodles but overall, I still really liked my dish. It was a good portion too, just enough to fill me up but not so much that I had to take it home or leave feeling uncomfortably stuffed. I think Morris is still my favorite ramen place in Madison but I would definitely return to Strings if I was in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. The tonkotsu ramen with pork belly is absolutely delicious.  If you're looking for the fattiest,  well marinated pork belly, this is the spot. What made the food even better was the service! The vibe was excellent and the servers are so friendly.  If you have Leo as your server, you are in great hands! He makes you feel right at home as if you have been going to that place for years."}
{"text":"This is a PSA for anyone who might be interested in trying the \"monster hell challenge.\" When I saw the announcement that Strings was opening in Madison and read about their hell challenge on the Chicago website, I knew I would need to pay a visit sometime soon. However, I couldn't find much information about people's past experiences on Yelp/Reddit, other than that it was insanely spicy.

My dining compatriot and I chatted with the server while we were waiting for the food to come. When she mentioned that only three people had ever successfully completed the challenge -- even across all the Chicago locations -- a wave of dread washed over me. The first surprise when the food arrived was that the bowl for the ramen challenge was about 50% bigger than a regular portion. The second surprise was that the \"broth\" was basically a bowl of opaque chili oil.

I have an affinity for extremely spicy food and regularly challenge myself by ordering the spiciest items on the menu (I once survived going to a Szechuan restaurant in Singapore and accidentally ordering spice level \"5\" because it momentarily slipped my mind that I was in Singapore -- bad idea!). Even for me, digging into this dish felt like eating pure fire, and there was no way I would have been able to drink all the oil. The rules state that you have to finish the entire bowl, and also that you're only allowed to drink a single glass of water.

I declared defeat after eating about 1/3 of the (non-chili-oil) contents and drinking my glass of water. I would liken my condition at that point to the time I took a bite of a raw Carolina Reaper at the DCFM as part of a chili-eating challenge. As I recovered by drinking more water over the next 10 minutes, I had the enjoyment of watching the reactions of my partner and a diner at the next table as they sampled some of my leftover ramen.

So there you have it. If you like spice-eating contests, this is probably worth a try, but you should be prepared to drink lots of chili oil! Strings has probably usurped KJ's Curry Bowl as the restaurant offering the spiciest food in Madison.

P.S. I can't comment on the taste of the food, because my mouth was burning -- but my partner told me he thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of the spicy clam & pork ramen! The wait staff were also extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I went to strings a few nights ago after seeing the building sit empty got 2 years. I went for the hells ramen Level 2. It was really good! He spice was tolerable, until I was at the bottom. I did not love the pork rinds in the ramen but took them out. The pork was not the most flavorful but the broth made up for it. I will definitely be back to try some of the other ramen bowls. I did also get the dumplings, the pork, which were good. Could have been a little more pan fried but overall enjoyed them. 

Overall it is a good ramen place in the heart of campus. Would definitely recommend going to try it!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and got the pork belly (kuro buta) tonkatsu ramen. My thoughts:

-noodles are fresh and you can tell. Some of the best noodles that I'd had.
-soft-boiled egg is really well-cooked. That it can ooze out a little bit but still leave a bit of yolk adhered to the white is pretty impressive.
-there are a lot of onions. I don't think that many are necessary for flavour, and texturally it was a bit odd.
-soup temperature was interesting. It was warm, definitely not lukewarm, but also not quite hot. Usually expect it to be slightly warmer and was a bit offput upon first sampling.

One of the main off-putting things was that they gave you plastic cups for the tea - very unusual for any kind of Asian restaurant, and I can't help but notice that even crappy faux Asian places will at least attempt to give you some more authentic vessel for your beverage. Visuals are a big component of Asian cuisine, and there's something cheap and artificial that seems off about hot green tea in a small plastic cup. 

Note that they do not do split checks and will not take more than 3 cards per check. Seating can sometimes be a bit cramped when tables are full."}
{"text":"Noodles are ok but broth is pretty good. Really busy. 

However, one time the manager didn't put our name down because we would not be waiting in the restaurant for our name to be called but didnt tell us that until we came back, so we end up waiting another 45 minutes to sit. Some more people walk in, ask to have their names put down, and the same manager ASKS THEM IF THEY WANT TO LEAVE AND GET A DRINK SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE CALLED. How ridiculous! I was literally fuming the whole dinner. Won't ever come back. Absolutely ludicrous."}
{"text":"My boy Leo hooked me up. Been here twice now but you need Leo. Got the spicy clam and pork fantastic. Definitely come again"}
{"text":"This is the only place in Madison where they serve ramen that is spicy enough for me. I'm not happy until I get my money's worth by using up 100 napkins to wipe my drooling nose.

And to boot - great service and the egg, my god the egg was the best egg I've had with ramen. 

First off - the egg is unique in that it's not cut in half, and it comes on the side through a separate container - but then you understand why - this sucker was perfectly cooked and oozed everywhere when I bit into it.

Go get some!"}
{"text":"So good. I actually opted out of Ramen and got the Yaki Soba instead. Noodles were excellent and the toppings were interesting (pepperoni and turkey... who would have thought?!) It looks like they're applying for a liquor license now, so soon you should be able to have a beer with your dinner. In the meantime, you should certainly go for the food! 

Side Note: when the waitress tells you that the 'Hell Ramen Challenge' is so hot you won't enjoy it (and you'll probbably have to call in sick to work the next day) take her advice and order a real meal. We sat next to a table who, after the waitress strongly advised against it, ordered it anyway, and sure enough the guy couldn't finish it and left feeling bad about the whole experience. I feel bad that there's an item on the menu that the wait staff has to warn against, especially with so many good options on there. LISTEN TO THE WAIT STAFF, PEOPLE. They're there to make sure you have a good time."}
{"text":"A little bit on the pricier side for a ramen shop but still very delicious! Had the Hell level 2 ramen which was just spicy enough and had plenty of flavor. None of the other ramen shops in town have really done spicy ramen well except for this place.

Noodles made in house and plenty of different options for both ramen (such as type of broth and toppings to add in) and appetizers. The service was great as well, everyone is very friendly.

The menu even has a guide for how to eat ramen lolol. There's even a terminology section which was actually pretty helpful. 10/10, def coming here again"}
{"text":"The spicy clam and pork tonkatsu is great! This place is pricey for a ramen place, but I will definitely come back if they continue to make high-quality noodles."}
{"text":"The service is amazing and the food is so good!!! You might have to wait but its still so gooooood"}
{"text":"Worth going to! I like that you can get some more traditional apps as compared to ramen, and the varying broths and toppings and spiciness levels. 
I got the tontaksu - bone broth ramen, and husband for the crab miso ramen. 
Both were very good - hot (temperature), noodles were al dente, chashu pork belly was nice and seared and melt in your mouth.  Portions were a good size too. 
The four stars comes from:
Our server was a little pushy in the recommendations, and a somewhat absent when we ordered kaedama (extra noodles). 
It's expensive!  By the time you have an app (gyoza), you add two extra toppings and extra noodles, our bill was $50 with tip. And that's without any drinks! For noodles and dumplings, that's a bit much IMO.  
Will I go back? Yes, I want to try a spice level 3 or 4 one time. Do I like it better than Morris? Only for the easier parking and gyoza ordering ability."}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE spicy food but was crazy to think I could complete the Monster Hell Ramen Challenge.

Let me back this up, though -- we came here for my baby sister's birthday. We had a party of 11, including three little ones under at four. I would not recommend taking kids here (remember, we came fort sister's birthday). When we sat, our waiter did not offer a high-chair so we asked for one. He said he could \"check,\" but shouldn't he \"know\" this?? Upon return, he gave us booster chairs which had no straps. This sat upon their cushioned bench, so my husband and I tied a blanky around our Babes' lap and took turns holding the seat the entire time (slurping Ramen). The waiter (Leo) asked if we had been here before, proceeded to recommend the dumplings for the little ones and how we could request the chili oil be separate. He talked a bit about the ramen and mentioned the challenge briefly. We already scoped the menu out during our wait so ordered right away. But it wasn't till we ordered that we found out they were out of chicken dumplings (another thing I feel is often mentioned right away). Aside from that, the waiter took forever to bring my husband's extra side of noodles (which was ordered right away), along with the bill and my to-go order of Cat Rice. I should also probably mention that this was a Monday night. So, you can see why I gave them three stars...

Anyway, my SIL and I went for the ramen challenge and failed! The broth is legitimately, all chili oil... I'm tellin ya, I could not taste any salt till my tears hit my lip, ya'll! No joke. A waiver needs to be signed, even if you only want to taste it. My sister and brother wanted to taste our bowls after we waved our white flags and they brought out waivers for them. Still -- it was a fun experience but I will never order Level 5 again. I did try the broths of my husband's (Level 3), and my sister's (Level 4 and the Tonkatsu) -- all were delicious! Dumplings were also yummy, too! So the flavor IS there, and I would say this my favorite of Madison so far (minus the terrible service!) My only comparisons are Ramen Station and Umami, though. Noodle-wise, I prefer Unami's hand-made noodles... The Cat Rice was okay. I've had better and more fresh poke elsewhere! Try the one from Muramoto on King St!"}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen! So far it is the best I have had in Madison. I am quite fond of the level 4 hell Ramen, the pork belly is also very good."}
{"text":"Heard they open a chain reman store from Chicago. When I come to Madison and visit my friend. We definitely can over to have the best ramen. They are as good as Chicago's. Service is good and food is good. You can defiantly tell they have homemade noodle."}
{"text":"I waited for about 15 minutes before seated. Then the server came and suggested me to get a kind of ramen which was the most expensive one. I went with the Tonkatsu ramen with pork belly. I also ordered milk tea and the little dessert. After he took my order, it felt like ages until my ramen and milk tea finally came! The ramen tasted pretty good except that the port belly is really fat and the broth was really oily. I tried to drink all the broth but just ended up feeling kind of sick because of all the oil. After I finish my ramen, it also felt like ages until the server came, and he asked me if I want the check. I was like: I ordered dessert, remember? After I ate my dessert and he finally brought me the check, which was an iPad, I had to choose to tip him between 18% to 20%. I really didn't feel like paying him that much but I clicked on 18% anyway because he was staring at me!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen spot. They have tonkotsu ramen which is the best kind imo but not every ramen place serves it. Egg was cooked perfect. Pork gyoza was great. I did add some of the spicy sauce used for the gyoza to my tonkotsu for some much needed kick, it was definitely a milder tonkotsu (needed some salt). Once I added the sauce it was perfect. We will be back . Our server was also fantastic ."}
{"text":"Great food can't wait to go back. Spicy crab ramen and cat rice were on point. Went Friday wish they were open during the week for lunch because I would eat lunch there if they were open."}
{"text":"This ramen is my favorite in Madison! I would have to say that Morris ramen bears this place in ambiance and options for having a complete meal out (it's not a real meal without a cocktail), the ramen at Strings has the spice and flavor I crave in my noodle bowls. I am too much of a wimp to go after Hell ramen, but the spicy pork and clam ramen is so tasty. I usually order a \"side of hell\" to customize the spice to my preferred level. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Strings Ramen tops most of the ramen places here in Madison for me. I ordered the Spicy Crab and my boyfriend got the Tonkatsu Kuro Buta ramen. We also ordered a side of pork belly and chicken gyoza. The Spicy Crab ramen bowl does smell crabby but it is not a bad crabby smell. It's broth is thicker, creamy, but still soupy enough. There is a good amount of real peeled crab legs in the ramen. Overall it's a great treat if you are in the mood for some ramen and want some seafood. The Tonkatsu Kuro Buta broth is a good pork based broth. The pork belly that they put in the Tonkatsu Kuro Buta melts as you eat it. My boyfriend was in love with the Tonkatsu Kuro Buta. I'd have to say, I hate ramen that is really salty. Strings Ramen does it right. I would recommend Strings Ramen for those who haven't had the ramen experience ever, those who love ramen already, and just anyone who wants a good bowl of gourmet ramen. The service was also one of the best services I've had in a long while. Strings Ramen also has locations in Chicago."}
{"text":"I went to Strings for the first time a few weeks ago for my partner's birthday and I loved it. Disclaimer: I am a pescatarian/vegetarian, so this is a review of their vegetarian ramen. 

Some thoughts, in no particular order:
- nice ambiance (it's a cute spot for a date night or more intimate dinner--it's not a huge space)
- great service; our server was exceptionally warm and helpful
- the vegetarian/pescatarian (I can't remember if it had fish sauce) ramen was delicious! I've eaten the vegetarian ramen at two other spots in Madison (Sujeo and Morris). While I don't like the vegetarian ramen at Morris, Sujeo does a great job and so does Strings. I ordered the Hells ramen. It doesn't come with an egg, so I will make sure to ask for one next time. 

All in all--the experience/food wasn't *phenomenal* but I don't have a single complaint, enjoyed the food, and had a great time. Really recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice experience.  The decor is minimalist but perfect for the experience.  Servers are knowledgeable and take thw time to explain the menu.  Broth for the ramen is deep and delicious.  I added pork belly to my order and it was cooked perfectly.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you'll automatically be greeted by the entire restaurant staff! Very welcoming. The wait isn't bad if you're there before rush hour times. I highly recommend to go early and call ahead to see what time. 

In regards to the food, I had the crab ramen which was a tab bit salty for me and not enough toppings. In addition, I purchased an egg and it wasn't as flavorful as most ramen shops. Hoping they adjust the broth to be more flavorful as well.

Overall experience was pleasant, 3/5 because of the broth!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the location in Chicago and heard this place was open.  I ran to my same server Leo at this location. Quality food and service"}
{"text":"Food is good, service's not. 
I understand they are busy, but they need to be more professional."}
{"text":"Welcome to the chain of one of the best Ramen from Chicago. I went during the first week of opening on a Sunday night and it was already a 30 minute waiting to be seated. I thought to myself \"boy it better live up to the hype\" and fortunate for me, it did.

We ordered the Hell's ramen level 2 and tonkotsu with clam and pork and a side of pork belly. 

Hell's ramen is it's specialty. To spice up the traditional Japanese ramen bowl, different types of chili are added depends on the level of spiciness, from Sichuan chili to ghost pepper and scorpion pepper. There are 5 levels in total where level one is the least spicy and level 5 is basically hell . The level 2 we tried was to me a mild to medium spiciness. Although the Hell's ramen is the hype of this place, I am not a big fan. The Sichuan chili didn't go very well with the broth and it gave me a mixed flavors which unfortunately wasn't delicious. The broth lost its rich umami flavor and the spiciness that replaced it was disappointing. 

 Tonkotsu which is the pork broth was, however, amazing. I would dare to say, one of the best in Madison. Rich umami flavor and chewy hand-made noodle created a perfect combination one would look for from a ramen bowl. The bowl came with clam, ground pork, seaweed, bamboo shoot and half a running yummy egg. This bowl definitely went into my list of fav food in Madison without a doubt. 

The side of pork belly was also delicious. Soft, well marinated, the piece of pork belly just melted in my mouth. Yummm.... I wish they would make it into a pork belly bun though. Imagine that melting fattiness soaking into the white bun, top with some green onion for garnish just make me happy 

I'm glad the shop brings the modern, simplistic taste to the decor of the shop. The yellow light from multiple lanterns dangling from the ceiling gives you a homey, charming ambience but the light colored, modern furniture is perfect for a quick lunch environment. 

Overall, if you are craving a good bowl of rich, flavorful to make your day a little bit happier, this is the place"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this place. They make their noodles fresh by hand but I didn't find it flavorful. The broth isn't anything special either. I had to add soy sauce to add a bit more flavor to it. Overall, I would not go back only because there are better options to choose from that is more affordable. Try Ramen Kid and Morris Ramen. I prefer Morris above Ramen Kid but Ramen Kid has Poke and other options to choose from."}
{"text":"Strings has been on my radar for a while since it was pretty famous in Chicago for its hell ramen, so I was stoked to find out that they opened a location in Madison.

I rolled in with the squad on a week night. The first thing I noticed was the appetizing smell of boiling bone broth being prepared which was a smell I was familiar with since I had just made ramen broth the week before. There were illustrations of different ramen styles on the wall, and the kitchen was visible from every part of the restaurant allowing you to see all the hard work that goes into preparing a bowl of ramen. A lot of the glass in the restaurant is covered in different words to describe ramen. Ramen lovers will be excited upon entering this place.

We were told that the wait was about 20 minutes, so we put our names down. The wait actually ended up being 45 minutes, but at least they gave us some hot green tea to sip on while we waited.

When we finally sat down, and were greeted by our server. Although, he was really nice, his service just felt so ingenuine and rehearsed. For example, as he walked through the menu, he pushed the veggie gyoza really hard saying that it was easily their most popular item, but they were out of pork gyoza, so that made me think that they wee just trying to get rid of it before it went bad.

As an appetizer ordered cat rice, and I added uni (sea urchin gonads) for $5 per my server's suggestion. The cat rice was a bowl of rice seasoned with soy sauce and furikake then topped with cubes of raw tuna tossed in spicy mayo. It was pretty good at first, but it started to just taste like rice and soy sauce after a while. The uni was a pointless addition.  Though $5 for a little uni was fair price, it was such an insignificant amount that they tried to make up for by serving it in between two halves of a soft boiled egg. The egg went pretty well with the rice, but the uni didn't. I was surprised to see the uni drenched in egg yolk because the uni itself has a delicate, unique taste. The egg yolk only overpowered the uni and took away what makes uni so special. 

We all ordered our ramen with an egg for an extra $1, but neither the menu or the server warned us that our ramen already came with half an egg, so we were surprised when we got our ramen with eggs on the side. They seemed to take pride in their fresh noodles, but they had a weak texture without any chewiness. The tonkotsu broth had a pretty average flavor, but the spicy clam and pork version was pretty good. The chashu pork belly slice was pretty good; it was soft and melty and had a beautiful char on it.

After dinner, we were offered little cookies (that the server gushed about) in exchange for getting photographed for their social media. I've done worse for free food, so we obliged. Our server thanked us and asked us to tell people about Strings claiming that there haven't been a lot of customers (even though we had to wait for 45 minutes for a table on a week night).

Overall, I thought the food was a little better than ok. What I didn't like was how dishonest and corporate the vibes were. The words used for decoration on the wall talked about a bunch of different kinds of ramen that they don't even serve. The host gave us an estimated wait time that was half of what the real wait time was. Our server tried to get us to order things that we didn't need; I just felt like we were being nickel and dimed. I recommend trying Strings if you like ramen, but don't be surprised if their gimmicks turn you off. However, one should keep in mind that this location is still very new; I'm sure there are still some things that need to be worked out."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Ramen place since starting school in Madison and to my luck a place opened right across the street from my dorm! Not only is this place super convenient it's also delicious. It's very clean, the staff is very attentive and nice, and it's overall a great place to grab dinner with your friends! They also offer complementary green tea upon entering the restaurant, which I thought was nice. Highly recommend the Shoyu Kora Buta ramen."}
{"text":"Gooooooooooddddd ramen!
At the writing of this review, this is the best ramen I have had in Madison!

What I tried:
Miso ramen with pork loin- broth is nice and flavorful, not too salty, excellent mouth feel. Good amount and diversity of toppings. Noodles were okay, definitely not the best ramen noodles I've ever had, didn't quite have the texture I was looking for, but are fine.

But... there were some issues that I will not ignore. Which is why I had to knock this rating to 3 stars.
1. The service was pretty awful the Sunday evening I visited. Inattentive waitstaff with attitude and eye rolling for asking questions. Yikes!
2. Major timing issues. The miso eggs came out 10-15 mins before the ramen, then the extra noodles came out 10-15 mins after the ramen arrived. This is just a bizarre way to give people their food. 
3. To keep up the authenticity, they include a lot of phonetic Japanese words. Please, please, please, include the English in parenthesis. Then, may be one day I will learn the words. I really hate pulling my phone out at a restaurant to look stuff up, or have to ask an excessive amount of questions. Hence the problem with the eye rolling mentioned above.
4. Extras and prices need to be more obvious. Ramen is about customizing it to your taste. Please don't make that hard for me!  I just want a good bowl of ramen with fun toppings. Apparently this cloak and dagger business is because they have a secret menu. Which, cool party, can I come?

Overall, I will come back, and try all the other ramen! But, don't give me attitude and at the very least, bring my extra noodles out with the ramen."}
{"text":"The hell ramen is really good!! I recommend level 2, the flavor is rich but not too spicy. We got LEO as our server for several times. Good service!!! And also good ramen!!"}
{"text":"I was looking to try something new when I saw this place. I thought at first it was a different restaurant that I'd looked at before, but was very happy that I went anyway to give it a try. I saw a couple items on the menu that I knew I was going to try and then they had a special going that day that was a mix so it worked out great. 
Had to wait 20 minutes to get a table for lunch. The small location was packed. I thought a good sign. After a late night with friends, this place ended up being a great place to get an amazing meal. The noodles were so good. You can tell they put time and effort into making a good broth. 
I'll go here again."}
{"text":"I decided to check this new place out before hitting Overture. They've got touches to try to feel authentic yet modern Japanese that if you've actually been to Japan you find a bit cute with how they're close but a bit off. These are more obvious to me, being Japanese, like their very strange spelling of tonkotsu and Hokkaido (in Japanese) above the counter when you walk in and the off-accent ???????? (irasshaimase), but that's being picky :)

I had a bit of a wait at 6pm on a Tuesday but nothing crazy. It is a smaller place with maybe 10 tables total, seating 4-6 ppl each. I got the tonkotsu ramen with pork belly. The broth temperature was fine but could've been hotter (maybe the fattiness of tonkotsu broth cools off faster? I've noticed this at many other places too with tonkotsu). The ramen itself was much firmer than any other ramen I've had in Madison, in a good way, but I would go for a tad bit softer. The flavor of the broth itself was fine but nothing special for me. It is creamy as it's supposed to be; I probably just am not a tonkotsu person to be honest. The ajitsuke egg was good but cool, which felt a bit odd in hot ramen.

For $14 I'm not sure it's quite worth it. I know for sure the royal milk tea (canned) is not worth it. There are much better Japanese royal milk tea brands, and the dedicated boba places down the street are solid (though royal milk tea is not quite the same as Taiwanese milk tea!). Their level 5 hell challenge is a bit intriguing though, but I didn't get the spicy sauce on the side to test out how big of a deal it really is. It seems to be a regular bowl of ramen with a lot of chili to be eaten in 20 min."}
{"text":"I am admittedly a bit of a skeptic when it comes to the recent ramen craze, but Strings Ramen has me thinking that I have been missing out. I really enjoyed my experience - the food, service, and ambiance really impressed. 

I went in on a Wednesday evening after work and was a bit surprised by how busy it was. Plenty of people waiting for a table, though the place itself is pretty small as well. The waiting area is quite minimal, so it can get crowded, but the manager did his best to catch each new group that walked in, as well as offer hot tea as we waited. Nice touch! 

Though the space is small, I really liked the decor. Unpretentious, bright and airy, with a cool open kitchen concept. There aren't that many tables, which prevents the small space from being overly loud and stuffy. 

Service was prompt as soon as we sat down, and our server was so friendly and knowledgeable. I haven't had such a personable waitress in a really long time - she was wonderful!!! 

The food though was the best part of the experience. We tried the gyoza, which I enjoyed, as well as the hell ramen and turkey yakisoba. The broth of the ramen (and small bowl of broth that came with the yakisoba) were both delicious - flavorful, rich, and unique. We finished our meal with the green tea mochi ice cream which was delicious - small but refreshing end to a great meal.

Overall, I can't say I'm a ramen aficionado, but Strings Ramen made me a believer in the craze. Great quality food, excellent service, peaceful atmosphere. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was stoked to try Strings Ramen as it won the title for Best-Voted Ramen in Chicago! I really liked the decor, very modern and simple - and I am always a big fan of open kitchens. Staff were super friendly and knowledgeable which I always appreciate. The booths that are along the windows on Frances Street are really small, they uncomfortably seat up to four people, but are perfect for two. I like how they offer a variety of broths, and levels of spicy too! The menu is very attractive but to be honest, I found the simple menu made it harder for me to order. I really struggled with not knowing what came with my ramen vs. what I had to order as extras, and ended up having to ask our server. We both ended up just ordering the tonkotsu with pork and clam as is. I loved how rich the broth was, but it was too salty for my taste and the noodles more chewier than I prefer. I did love the big spoons to help slurp up the broth! The drinks were overpriced (really? $2.95 for Ramune?) but I really wanted to try the royal milk tea. Not worth the $3, but I can at least say I tried it! To be honest, for how expensive the meal was for two people (~$20/each not including tip), I didn't leave thinking it was the best ramen I had ever had (which makes me sad). I'll probably be back to try the Hell Ramen though.
PS: They charge gratuity for parties of 4 or more AND checks can only be split 3 ways maximum. Big turn-down for me if I wanted to have a dinner with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place since it was rated best ramen in Chicago and I heard many friends talking about it. I enjoyed the decor and liked the pictures of the different kinds of ramen on the board. I went on a night without many people, so I obtain my table right away and the service was great. I had the miso ramen with pork belly and I loved the flavor of the broth and the pork belly had an amazing taste even though I would have liked it a bit more crispy. The noodles had a great texture, but overall I was a bit disappointed to find out my ramen did not come with an egg, which is one of my favorite parts of many ramen dishes. Even without the egg I it was a great dish and I would come back to try the other kinds of ramen they offer."}
{"text":"really good! ramen was super spicy, potstickers were really yummy, and we got complementary green tea!!"}
{"text":"This ramen shop is a good choice if you're thinking of having ramen near the capital. The restaurant has a various different types of ramen and even has some special Japanese imported sodas to try. The food comes out pretty quickly and tastes good."}
{"text":"All the ramen and broth are made in house, which adds an extra level of freshness to the meal. I got the Hell 2 Ramen, and it was very flavorful. Definitely get a side of the lava egg if your bowl doesn't include it. Expect a long wait on weekend nights, but it'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"Never was a big fan ramen but I work in the area so I decided to check it out, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a small restaurant and there were several large parties so it was a bit of a wait, but that's fine. The only thing is they don't serve alcohol so we went and grabbed drinks elsewhere during the wait. 

Our server Leo was amazing, he walked us through the menu and suggested some pretty amazing options, I ended up with the crab miso ramen and it was so good and flavorful. Leo also recommended this melon cream Japanese soda and I think I will be fantasizing about it for awhile"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen in Madison. The service is super awesome, especially the dude Leo, who served me super well!! Thank you man!"}
{"text":"Our party of 2 went to Strings Ramen for the first time on a late Sunday night.  We didn't have any problems finding seating but I can see how this place might fill up quickly during busy lunch/dinner hours.  There are about 4-5 tables seating larger parties in bench style booths and 4-5 high tops for smaller parties.  

1. Spicy clam and pork tonkatsu ramen - The minced pork with the semi-spicy broth is tasty.  The ramen was al-dente enough for my taste as well.  The menu can be confusing if you enjoy a molten lava egg with your ramen.  This ramen does come with a lava egg.  We made the mistake of ordering two extra eggs with our ramen orders. The eggs came out as single instead of within the ramen bowl which is odd.  The soup base does have a hint of cream for those who are dairy-challenged

2. Kuro Bata shoyu ramen - not bad, but I prefer the tonkatsu ramen better.  


Our server did bring out a huge pitcher of water for each table, for those interested in trying their hell ramen.  We opted out of the hell ramen during this visit, but we'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I visited Strings again to try some of their off menu items: Uni (Sea Urchin)Tamago, Ikura (Salmon Roe) Tamago and Lamb Curry Ramen.

Their uni and ikura were fresh. Coupled with the oozy goodness of egg yolk, subtle heat of wasabi and mouthful of umami, you are definitely guaranteed a trip to space. 

Lamb curry ramen was innovative and not your typical ramen experience. The lamb was tender and flavorful. I added some hell sauce to make my bowl more dynamic.

Our server, Leo, was friendly and helpful as usual.  He is what brings my friends and I back over and over again.

[Tip: Mention \"TBB\" to see if you can try the items before they put them on the menu. You will thank me.]"}
{"text":"Love It. Best ramen in town. Unlike other ramen places, the broth has a lot of flavor and it's not just salty. I recommend the cat rice (tuna on rice). I don't usually like raw meat but the flavors of the cat rice blends the tuna and therefore It taste delicious. We Love getting the pork bone broth with a side of the level 3 Hell Ramen peppers. Definitely give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"Decent Ramen place in Madison, good soup base, especially miso and tonkotsu. Pretty surprised with the hell ramen, it is nowhere near the traditional Japanese hell ramen as it uses lots Szechuan chili bean paste. But if you're a big Szechuan cuisine fan, you'll love such authentic tastes!"}
{"text":"With the seeming boom of ramen restaurants in Madison, sometimes it becomes hard to stand out. This restaurant however does a great job at it. The atmosphere places you right in front of the chefs that are preparing your meals from scratch! Everything feels so authentic, and the aromas from the different broths made completely fills the room (prepare to smell like soup afterwards - it's a great aphrodisiac TBH). The menus, although in another language, was explained perfectly by our server. The soups are organized based on how thick the soups are (lighter and thinner soups for warmer days, and thicker for colder days). The only reason this isn't a five star review is my preference for a crunchy pork belly with my ramen. I still have yet to find this though. Lastly, their Donburis are ROCK STARS. A little on the fatty side, but STILL AMAZING. Pro-Tip: Order one for the table to share."}
{"text":"Really great vibe here. The Miso Ramen was delicious as well as the Shrimp Gyoza! 
Also, Leo was an amazing server. . 
He had a wonderful sense of humor and the most genuine personality. He made the experience special. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I didn't dare get anything off the hell ramen section. Hats off to you if you do though. I mean, I hear the level 1 is tolerable. I'd consider trying it, but I'm definitely not brave enough.

I got the Kuro Buta Tonkotsu Ramen. It was so good! They put tons of noodles in it. I feel like I could barely finish it. The egg that comes with it was probably my favorite. I got the pork belly rather than the loin, but traded with someone who got the loin. I liked both a lot. Loin was obviously leaner.

The wait staff was nice. I thought it was slightly pretentious that they were bowing and stuff. By slightly I mean very."}
{"text":"Love the ramen - I had the spicy crab one! too bad there was not enough crab meat but the taste compensated for it. Dumpling and mochi are to die for too!!! I went there at 5 pm w a friend to avoid waiting - there was no line! Good service and would definitely be back to try their tonkotsu."}
{"text":"I wanted to have ramen for my birthday and decided to try the jigoku ramen.
I ordered the Shugou - level 3 vegetarian version. It was hot! I wanted to take the level 5 challenge but after eating their level 3 I think I am going to stick to just that.
My mouth was on fire but not in a bad way. The flavors were still there. I also ordered sides of the spicy menma... it was spicy but the sesame oil flavor was slightly intense and the tamago that I am glad I did since it helped tame the heat of the ramen a little.
Food - 4.5
Service - 3 they have to be more friendly and not just slap the bill on the table since I was there for a long time.
Ambience - 4 the music was too loud

Overall, I enjoyed my meal and will come back again."}
{"text":"It is a new Ramen store in Madison. As the famous Chain ramen store from Chicago, it is quite popular. We stopped in 6:30pm Tuesday night and waited around 20 minutes. 
The staff are all friendly and the environment is nice. We ordered level 3 hell ramen $15.95, Tonkotsu ramen with spicy clams & pork $13.95, shrimp Gyoza $6.95 and Kuro buta loin $5.95. 
The soup is really rich and yummy. My husband thought the ramen is too chewy for him. So a suggestion for the people who does not love chewy style ramen, you could ask the server double spoiled noodle. I think the extra side Kuro buta loin tastes normally(nothing special for me) but cost too much. The shrimp Gyoza is delicious.
If the price could be lower, it is better. $45.16 before tip for two is a little higher price for a ramen store!"}
