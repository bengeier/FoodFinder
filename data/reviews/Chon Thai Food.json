{"text":"The staff is very kind, and the atmosphere and decor is very cozy and welcoming. I'm glad to have found a go-to Thai spot. The food is excellent and a great value. Their Tom yum soup is great, and so is the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Awesome food,  wonderful service. Food was so good. Medium spice is great. We all tried something new an really enjoyed our meals  good portion size. Great atmosphere. We will be returning for sure"}
{"text":"I came to Chon Thai in desperate need to satisfy my craving for Thai food. Having lived in Gilbert for the past 10 years, I have yet to find a Thai place worth coming back to.. Until I tried Chon. I would highly recommend this place not only because the food is excellent, but the service is friendly and genuine. 

My family and I started with an order of crispy vegetable spring rolls (3) They were a little small, each half was about one bite, but the filling was yummy and cooked perfectly.

I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken with medium spice. The spice wasn't too overwhelming, but just enough. My only negative is that the noodles were too small. Most Thai places use thicker rice noodles which I favor more. However, the flavor was delicious with noticeable hints of tamarind. I would order it again!

My family ordered the Salmon Panang, Crispy Chicken Panang and Pad See Ew. They all really enjoyed theirs but said that the Panang was a little sweet.

Overall, Chon serves excellent food while deliver quick and friendly service. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I used to work in Downtown Phoenix and would eat at Wild Thaiger regular.  From my experience nothing in the East Valley even came close -- until now.  The Panang is amazing, the chicken soup is out of this world, the drunken noodles are off the chain.  There isn't a single thing that i've tried here that wasnt off the charts.  Not only is the best thai food in the east valley, this is easily one of my favorite restaurants in the area now, which if you are a foodie you realize there is some serious competition for your food bucks within miles.  Try it, love it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I had the Pad Thai with chicken (medium) the first time I was here two days ago and the Drunken Beef Noodles (hot) today.  Both dishes were fantastic although I will regress to medium heat the next time as I sit here sweating while writing this review.

I ordered the mango sticky rice desert which was marvelous and definitely helped reduce the heat.

Not many restaurants on Yelp have a full 5 star rating after 100+ reviews.  There's always a great reason for it.

I highly recommend this gem of a Thai food restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving a 4 star because they were so understaffed the night we went in. Also I'm appalled they don't have a sign in sheet at the hostess stand. We got there and one couple was in front of us, then about 15 minutes later a group of 4 arrived and so when a table came she just took the group of 4 that hadn't even been waiting 5 mins. Then she came back after the next 4 table open and tried to take me and my boyfriend and I was like actually the couple sitting was here way before us and the group you took before. It's not hard to have a sign in so that people who have been waiting the longest get seated first. They apologized being so understaffed, and the food there was very good! The pad Thai was good I got a 2 which is medium but next time I'll get a 3 I think it could've been a bit spicier. My boyfriend got the yellow curry which was the perfect amount of spice at a 2. Well definitely go back,but next time I might bring my own sign in sheet so we don't get passed up on getting seated."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fantastic well crafted meals. Extremely satisfied and will be back!"}
{"text":"Phone: 480-963-1247
Reminded me of the drunken noodles I had in Ko Samui, but better. The panang curry was as smooth and wonderful as I could have hoped.
There are a lot of Thai places in the SE valley, but Chon Thai is on the top of my list now. A lot of places around just don't have the balance of sweet, salty, sour, and spicy right, but they do.
Apparently I was the first to order the hottest level!
Check them out!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have ever had by far. Eaten here at least 6 times and it has been terrific each time. Favorite dish is red curry chicken. Have tried pineapple shrimp curry, pad Thai, green curry chicken, and all have been very tasty. The folks who wait on you will be very friendly and pleasant. Highly recommend you try."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! If you like Thai food, then this is a must try place!! Great service whether you are dining in or picking up a to go order! The owner and staff are so nice and always happy! My husband and I quickly became a regular after trying this place one!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. They also have really good service and the restaurant itself is beautiful."}
{"text":"Used door dash to order and when the delivery was ready to be picked up the dasher called to say they were out of wings and satay (both we had ordered), so nothing to sub, the peanut sauce they charge $2 for wasn't included and they put chicken in my meatless requested red Currie.  We eat lot of Thai food and have ordered from them at least a few times a month without or only very minor issues in the past, but this was just way to much."}
{"text":"Great choice for Thai. I'm a big fan of Chron Thai. This place tends to be less sweet as a general rule, which I like depending on my mood. My other favorite Thai place is a sweeter flair, Yuphas. Both I give top marks. 

I'm a flat noodle kind of guy and bam the pad see ew delivers. Also great pot stickers. 

The lunch is great and consistency is normally fairly good. Only a few times has he lunch been good instead of great."}
{"text":"They have a VEGAN menu!! THANK YOU!! We had the Pad Se Ew and the Chon Thai Rama.  Both were awesome! I'll be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the green curry chicken at Chon Thai.  The people who work there are very friendly and the service is excellent.  If you go, try the sticky rice with mango for dessert.  It's so good!"}
{"text":"Just checking out Chandler and Ahwatukee, we relied on Yelp to find a lunch spot and chose Chon Thai Food.  It was a great choice.  Lunch specials were delicious and came artfully garnished.  On a scale of 1 to 5 for spice, we chose 0 so my request for soy sauce was no surprise.  The host overheard  my request and brought over a fish sauce which he suggested might be a bit more authentic.  All smiles and thanks for coming to their lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"We took a large party (8 people) for our first experience at Con Thai right after Thanksgiving. The multiple dishes we ordered were wonderfully presented and enjoyed by our group.  We met the owners (one of which was Toby) who made sure we were taken care of.  All the staff were attentive and pleasant. The restaurant had a very nice ambience and was very clean. We tried the spring rolls, calamari and Papaya salad (spicy and authentic!)
For the main course... the curry dishes were so tasty (especially the panang curry beef!)  we also devoured the pad see-ew chicken, Tom kha chicken soup and pineapple fried rice.
Our group left full and happy...Thanks Toby and Con Thai!"}
{"text":"First time to visit this place and I must say that this Thai food restaurant is one of the best place I can recommend, not only the place was very clean and staff are friendly with great customer service, Nice was our server and Pat is awesome on making sure that good service was provided. I ordered the Garlic Fried Rice and it was so delicious, also had the mango sticky rice and fried banana with ice cream. I will be coming back to try some more of their other foods"}
{"text":"really good food, awesome prices, great ambiance and really nice customer service."}
{"text":"Wow this place is probably the best thai restaurant I've ever been to. The food was flavorful and amazing. The service was great too - the food came fast and the owner was very sweet. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Have tried multiple dishes here. Beef drunken noodles, Penang curry, Thai basil fried rice, Pad Pik King, Pad Thai, Cashew chicken. All have been great. I get medium heat and it's perfect.

Service is also good, waitresses are very nice. Food takes longer than what I'm used to for Thai but it's worth the wait... you can't get quality and speed! Best Thai restaurant in Phoenix I have tried so far. And consistent - every time food is solid. The owner cooks, which is always a good sign. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super super friendly staff. Lots of parking available and great food where you can give exact requests on level of spice. I got the drunken noodle which are vegetarian and they were delicious. Vegetarian options are easy to find on the menu."}
{"text":"I use to love this place, the food is now horrible. The rice is spicy, no vegetables in the fried rice. They've even changed their carry out box from card board to plastic. All the changes... I don't know what they've done, but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Best thai food in the east valley. We LOVE thai food & have tried a lot of different places."}
{"text":"Came here with the hubby last Sunday and was pleasantly surprised. 

We ordered the beef salad which had all the right spices, the ratio of spicy, salty, and sour was delightful and tasted wonderful! The bits of lemongrass takes me back to my moms cooking when she makes Larb, a different dish but taste is very similar. 

I had the red curry, which was just okay. Felt like they had way too much curry paste in it and wasn't diluted enough. I probably wouldn't order this again as I would want to try other things on the menu. 

Hubby ordered the crispy garlic chicken. He really enjoyed this dish. It had just enough crunch but wasn't heavily drenched in flower like orange chicken. The sauce was a little too sweet for me but I enjoyed it as well. 

Overall, I would come back and try other dishes. The menu and flavors seem authentic thus far. We also saw an older Asian lady working in the back, hopefully cooking the food so you know it's legit. LOL"}
{"text":"I love great Thai food and am so happy this restaurant is open now!  The red curry is some of the best I have ever had with so much depth in the flavors.  I've also tried the pad thai which was also delicious.  Run to this restaurant now!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, and then looked up their website. I'm not sure why their site isn't linked, but here it is: http://www.chonthaifood.com/

The customer service was excellent. I asked all kinds of questions, and the person who answered the phone was friendly and polite. They also allowed me to order items that they carry, but that aren't usually sold a la carte, so kudos to them for going the extra mile.

I placed an order for delivery, and was told it would take about 40 minutes. It arrived in 20. The driver was friendly and polite as well.

I ordered sides of sticky rice and peanut sauce, as well as mild yellow curry with chicken. The food was excellent, and arrived piping hot. I'm incredibly picky about meat- some places will skimp and include poor cuts or fatty or tough pieces. The chicken in my curry was perfect, and the dish was flavorful. I would like of offer a word of warning for others though- the mild isn't exactly mild. It did a good job of scorching my mouth and clearing my sinuses. It was still delicious, though."}
{"text":"My first visit.  I had the Panang with fried tofu medium spiced.  The customer service was outstanding.  The server was very attentive and the manager came by to see how I liked the food and level of spice.  The spice level was perfect.  The panang had a sweeter taste than I have had before but I liked it very much.  The vegetables and tofu were cooked perfectly.  And the portions left me with ample to take home for a bonus meal.  I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is good, but what I like the most about Chon is the value.  Lunch specials start at $5.99 and include items like green curry chicken and drunken noodle with beef.  The staff is always very friendly and attentive.  I'll definitely returning and recommending friends!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Chandler to date.  Food isn't over drenched with fish sauce like a lot of other Thai places..."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly service, good prices. Fresh ingredients, vibrant spices, can't wait to go back again! You must try the crispy garlic chicken, so good, and has perfectly fried crispy basil leaves on it... soooo good!"}
{"text":"Came from out of town looking for a place to try not believing a restaurant could be worthy of so many five star reviews. 

They destroyed my pessimism. 

Spring rolls. 
Pumpkin Curry Chicken mild heat with a side of rice. 
Sticky Rice and Custard. 

You can thank me later."}
{"text":"The great reviews on Yelp had us driving out to Chon Thai for our Friday family date night. This place did not disappoint. The food was very flavorful and the prices were quite reasonable. We ordered the fried tofu, spring rolls, pad see ew w/ chicken, red curry w/ tofu and the ginger chicken. The fried banana w/ coconut ice cream was the perfect ending to the spicy meal. 

If there was one thing that topped the food, it was the service. Everyone was warm, courteous and helpful. They went above and beyond to make our dining experience very pleasant. The manager made our dessert complimentary since it was our first visit. 

This is the kind of service that brings customers back. We will be back here very soon."}
{"text":"Quick delicious Thai food with great atmosphere. Had some great background music and extremely friendly staff."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WoW!!! The food is excellent the service is amazing. The servers and owner and very friendly and very welcoming! I had the Chicken Pumpkin Curry not to hot but it was delightful. Their appetizers are a small selection but just enough before a meal. I would definitely come again with my family."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants, if not my favorite.  The service couldn't be more kind, and I would be thrilled to just close my eyes and point to any dish on the menu.  This place is run with love."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner at Chon's! The service was amazing, pricing was fair and the food was delicious! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Although recently opened, I'm impressed by the authenticity of the food! The food is very flavorful and offers a variety from the traditional to Thai cuisine with a modern twist. We ordered papaya salad, tom yum soup, seafood salad and sticky rice with mango, and we absolutely loved everything! The staff are VERY nice and friendly, however not experienced and can cause delay in services on busy nights. We went on a Saturday night and waited about 30 minutes to be seated and then another 15-20 minutes to order and eventually got our food... :/ So if you are going on a weekend during dinner time, be mentally prepared for the potential long wait... That being said, it's a new restaurant, so i hope the owner will resolve the service level issue soon."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week and always love what we order. Pineapple shrimp curry is one of our favorites. Great kid menu options, too."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and the food was delicious and the service fantastic.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! The atmosphere is relaxed yet classy. Owners and staff are super friendly. Food tastes like it's made with fresh ingredients and the portions are perfect. By far, my favorite Thai place!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had Pumpkin chicken curry and Drunken beef noodles. It was ABSOLUTELY GREAT! Highly recommend!
Very nice servers too!!"}
{"text":"If I was going solely off the food, I would have given this place 1 star. The reason I gave them 3 was because the staff was friendly and so nice. So nice that I hate to give them a bad review. I went here thinking this place would be great based on the ratings.... WRONG, the basil rice was so nasty, that I had to scrape it off my plate because I didn't want it mixing w/ my other food. It tasted the way old mildewed clothes smell. The yellow curry was the only thing I thought was good..and the staff was excellent. Ill consider trying this place again, maybe the chef was in a bad mood or something."}
{"text":"It was a busy day and they looked short on staff, so the service was a little slow.  But the food was quite good with an ample portion.  The manager paid a visit to the table and helped us finish up and pay the bill.  I've been to many places and the manager just stands around instead of joining in with the staff.  To me that means they care and I will be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some fantastic Thai food, this is the place to go!

They have a great menu, with tons of options (including amazing vegan options!!). 

The yellow curry and sticky rice dessert with ice cream are just two of my favorites. Everything we have tried here has been absolutely delicious!

The owners are also so incredibly welcoming and friendly!

This is an awesome local business. Try it - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food. I went twice this week because the food was so good. Going back soon to try more dishes. All the staff was great too."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant after recommendations from a few friends.  The food is excellent, presentation is nice, and the servers are helpful.  I usually try Penang curry at any new Thai restaurant I visit and it was delicious here.  We also ordered my daughter a Pad Thai which was also phenomenal.  The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get.  I've been here a couple times and plan many repeat visits.  The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is that I think they are a bit understaffed so service is slower than desired but their friendliness and food quality make up for it."}
{"text":"This place is sort of tucked into a quiet plaza with other Asian restaurants. We went on a Thursday night and it was decently quiet with a few couples at tables. Cute decor inside. 

Food is surprisingly cheap and is SO DELICIOUS. Thai tea is some of the best I've ever had. We got:

Crab delights: crab and cream cheese puffs. Bomb. 
Spring rolls: served with sweet chili sauce. Also bomb. 
Panang Beef: deliciously sweet and a tiny bit spicy (medium) with lots of tender beef and vegetables and rice. 

Great service and amazing food. 5/5 would go back again and again."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this restaurant is the BEST. Not only very clean, nice and ambient atmosphere and authentic foods, but also staff is very friendly and makes sure you are very taken care of. Me and my husband love curry and Pad Thai and we always order them. I love Thai curry especially because you can taste herbs and a lot of ingredients(most places add too much sugar but not this restaurant!) I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried many many things at Chon Thai Food and I have never been disappointed! The food is delicious, fresh and authentic, the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is clean and comfortable. The owner is very kind and you can tell she takes pride and has love in the work that she does here. This is MUST try if your looking for the best Thai food in town!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new Thai restaurant and came across this 5 star/100review place.  We were not disappointed.  I had the Red Curry Chicken(Thai hot) and she had the Crispy Panang Chicken(hot).  Both of us were very happy we made the choice to come here.  The service was over the top friendly and my friend said the bathroom was spotless!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, gracious and kind service, reasonable prices. Do you need more reasons to go? The eggplant basil shrimp was particularly excellent, as was everything we tried. This is some of the best Thai food in the city. Highly recommended. I'll drive out of my way to go here to eat. In fact, I'm craving it now."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place in the valley! I've tried a lot of Thai places, but here the flavors are the greatest. The prices are reasonable and the service is excellent. This is my second time here and I'm glad to see that the full restaurant was packed! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is simply fabulous.   We are new to Thai food and have been back a few times this month.  The pumpkin curry and drunkin noodles are the best.  
If you are wondering if you should visit, do it.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing!!! Owner works the floor with finese - very helpful and accommodating. Service, food, selection and cost excellent. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a large soup for $50!! Tastefully decorated. Ask about spicyness level - you will surely get what you love!! No problem here. Would definitely return to this restaurant when I come back to town."}
{"text":"My dad and I came to this restaurant for lunch today. It wasn't crowded, nice atmosphere, and nice staff. They accidentally mixed up my order but were happy to bring out the dish I originally ordered and let me keep the other dish as well. Food was very tasty and fresh. They had various vegan options as well which made my dad very happy. Great place. Will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Thai food a great customer service. The owner is probably the only person I have ever met who is grateful and excited about every single thing that a customer does. Really high level of energy that is quiet refreshing. 

I em ever venture very far through Thai food menus because I am unfamiliar with most; two dishes I have had here are the pad Thai with chicken and the drunken noodles. The pad Thai is unique in that it has thinner rice noodles and not an overt peanut/peanut butter flavor. It avoids being heavy and greasy turning into something with a lot of flavor that is really lite. 

Drunk enough noodles have a strong spice and hearty flavor that is perfect for the 30 seconds of winter that Arizona will get per year. 

I visited this place when it was another Thai restaurant and the new ownership has improved eveything from decor to service to food. Defiantly always a place on our minds for a nice week night dinner"}
{"text":"I don't know why I do this to myself... I should of gone with my gut instincts and gone to Royal Thai Grill, but I was feeling hopeful that I might of found a good Thai restaurant closer to home.  First off, the service was great! They were very attentive and really friendly but that was about it.  The food was as Americanized as it gets.  The server even said they've toned it down a bit.  The portion was okay for the price.

We ordered the Glass Noodle Salad (off the menu), Pad See Ew, Panang, Fried Rice, and Pad Gra Pow.  The Glass Noodle Salad and Panang was decent and had more flavor than the other dishes.  The Pad Gra Pow and Fried Rice was basic and tasted like any other Asian restaurant dish.  The worst dish was the Pad See Ew.  They used AMERICAN BROCCOLI because they said it was easier to get than Chinese Broccoli! Really?  Do you know that Lee Lee is less than a mile away?!  They stockpile Chinese Broccoli there!  The taste was way off and lacked flavor.

I feel like the rating is was way off for this restaurant...."}
{"text":"Great food! I haven't ever had Thai food before and this is a great first experience! The manager is wonderful and such a great host! He makes you feel so welcomed while you are here. I cannot wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but I was very impressed with this restaurant. I got the chicken and shrimp pad thai and it had the perfect amount of spice. The food was amazing and to top it off, the service was also excellent!! My new favorite Thai restaurant. I'll definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Nailed it. If you're looking for a Thai place for quality...stop and try out Chon Thai. You won't be disappointed. Our waitress gave us great recommendations (plz plz plz try the Pla Lui Soun) and they were all delicious. Small crowd during Sunday afternoon, and the food came out quick and the entire staff was super attentive. I was really pleased with decorations and atmosphere...nice and relaxed...and I know my next date here would like it too :) Also, we ordered our dishes spicy, but they could use more spice (nothing to knock down a star for). We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm blown away by the quality of food, low prices and excellent service at this restaurant! I've been here several times and never disappointed. Give it a try - it'll be your new favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Always looking for good Thai food, and this place hits all the high notes! Friendly staff, fantastic food presentation, clean, nice simple atmosphere and reasonably priced. They're also set up well to handle large parties. There was a group of 15 right by us, and another birthday group arriving as we left."}
{"text":"One of the best for Thai food in the east valley. Food was very flavorful, service excellent and decor simple and elegant. Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place. When we crave for Thai, we make the trip to come out here. Pat is so friendly and personable. Gmfood is great and service is great!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have ordered from here in the past couple weeks and we continue to be amazed at how good the food is. Our first take out order included the crispy garlic chicken, pad see ew, and green curry vegetable. That order was fantastic! 

This time we switched it up a little and tried the chon Thai rolls (based on all the favorable reviews), green curry vegetable (it was too good to not get again) and crab fried rice with shrimp. 

The chon Thai rolls were good, but the star of the meal was the fried rice. The seasoning was top notch, and the shrimp added a superb flavor. 

This is definitely our new go to place for Thai food in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Sometime in November, this restaurant was sold. The new ownership did not keep the the old cooks and most of the old staff. As a result, the quality has deteriorated drastically. Once the most favorite Thai restaurant of my family has now become an ordinary place, or even less.  I have given it two sincere tries since the change, but our hopes have been shattered. The meat and vegetables are not fresh any more. The food taste is also average. Although they have kept the same menu, all the dishes taste similar. I would like to keep my mind open but my family refuses to go there any more. Those of you who patronized this place before, pl. post new reviews. I would like to know your experience."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Thai restaurant. Excellent food, fast service, and friendly staff. Great for a quick lunch as well as dinner. My personal favorite is their Tom Kha soup. Try it with rice!"}
{"text":"Our family finally found our favorite Thai food restaurant. We have our only girls family lunch dates about once a month. We will be coming back on a regular basis. My 13 yr old is hard to please and can not wait to return. The food is delicious and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"This is one of the the best Thai food places. The staff is courteous and very welcoming. The food is fantastic no other adjectives are needed."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Probably the best customer service I have seen in restaurants in a long time. Their food is great. We like the drunken noodles with chicken, cashew chicken and the red curry."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant a few days after they opened.  It has become my favorite Thai restaurant and my son always request to eat here.  Service is always outstanding, even when they are extremely busy.  The owner Pat is always friendly and so appreciative when customers return.  We eat here weekly and sometimes biweekly.   We love their Panang Beef curry, the beef is always tender and so flavorful.  My new favorite item is the Shrimp Eggplant basil, the eggplant is NOT oily like at Chinese restaurants, and the shrimp is succulent.  They are pretty generous with the protein.  I have never been disappointed with any of the dishes, in fact we always try to order something new at each visit."}
{"text":"This place is very good !! The service the presentation everything about it !!! Very pleased and satisfied with this place !!! Don't get me started with May awesome service by far the best I ever had !!!!! I highly recommend it !!!! I had the fried rice very well presented and very good flavors !! From the moment you walk in everyone is smiling and very attentive !!!"}
{"text":"What a switch from other places. People who are actually so nice it almost makes you feel funny. Either way I have been here several times and love the food, the ambience and the people . The food comes out fresh, fast and with excellent presentation . The presentation has a lot to do with their great reviews."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Thai restaurant to dine in on the Christmas eve.Where almost all restaurants were Closed, luckily we found Chon Thai on Yelp which was Open. It had good enough about 90 reviews but had 5 stars. Well, if it's on Yelp then you gotta trust it! So, thought of giving it a try and I must say it was a good find and we liked everything about it. 

Place is nicely decorated and was pretty neat and tidy! I was most impressed with the food, plating, flavor and their service. Not a whole lot in desserts but they have good options in appetizers, soups and entrees. Definitely visiting again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The service is excellent and the food is even better. You have to try the Sweet & Sour. 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Curry chicken and drunken noodles were amazing. Also had the mango with sweet sticky rice, pretty awesome too. Very friendly service and reasonable prices. YOU MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended from a coworker, so I decided to check it out for lunch one day. They weren't very crowded which I was happy about - expecting the service to be quick and efficient. Well, it really wasn't. It was quite a while before we were able to place an order, and despite the lack of customers it took a little bit longer than what I'd consider normal for the food to get to us. I would have been willing to overlook all that if the food had blown my socks off, but they didn't. Food was just ok.

Since so many people recommend this place so highly, I'll probably give it another shot."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley and the vegan menu is awesome! Love the great service and how friendly the staff is."}
{"text":"This is the only review I have ever made on Yelp, and its the only one that truly deserves 5 stars... This place has the friendliest staff, best prices, and MOST INCREDIBLE food ever. If I could give this place 10 stars out of 5, I would. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes meat OR vegetables. 

The \"custom\" crispy garlic tofu (normally chicken) was the best Thai food I have ever had... Ask them for it, you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I found this place scrolling through yelp and immediately noticed that this new place had 5 stars. After popping in for dinner tonight, it's easy to see why. Not only was the service great, but the food was fantastic and the restaurant is beautiful inside. 

We started with spring rolls and crab puffs as an appetizer and they were both to die for. The sweet chili sauce served with both was the best I have ever had- as was the thai tea and paneng beef curry. 

The real treat to this place is that it's incredibly affordable. We had an amazing meal for two people that cost us less than what we normally spend at chipotle. This place rules, tell everyone! 

Can't wait to go back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I can't believe I found a Thai food place that does Pad Thai perfect! I have been to Thailand, and this place is as close as you can get. Def coming back, esp with their resonable prices."}
{"text":"We LOVE Chon Thai Food!! One of favorite places to eat.  The calamari appetizer is the best.  We've yet to have a meal we didn't like. Service is great too!  Came for our anniversary our first time here and they made it very memorable."}
{"text":"Service is AMAZING. Food came out in a timely manner and was delicious. Definitely deserves the 5 star rating it has"}
{"text":"The food was not as good as we have had before. The Pad Thai was honestly the worst I've had....the soup was delicious. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Great atmosphere great vibes great service. Do your self a favor try it out. Best coffee too!!!"}
{"text":"Panang curry was very tasty and rich with a very nice lemon grass flavor. One of the best I have had."}
{"text":"Small portions, poor meat to vegetable ratio, not that flavorful, but they had decent service i guess."}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on the Yelp ratings and were definitely not disappointed! My wife noticed an odd smell at first that she got used to, but I didn't notice anything about. 

The food was excellent - spring rolls were crisp and not greasy. My wife ordered the crispy garlic chicken specialty and I got the crispy panang specialty. Although we both ordered them hot, mine was way spicier, I probably would do medium hot next time. 

Everything was fresh, extremely flavorful, and nicely presented. Ambiance was comfortable, well - lit, and casual. Friendly staff who did a great job recommended my dish."}
{"text":"Food was yummy, service was incredible. Portion size was very satisfying. I hope this restaurant continues to grow and stays in business. Great value for the price. Lots of selection. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"sorry previous reviewers - warning changed owners - chef- quality - taste - portions - service - all bad -"}
{"text":"Not sure who is padding these reviews. Went with four people and we are all Thai. Everything was not flavored properly. I asked the server to see if they forgot seasoning in my drunken noodles, and they took it back and poured soy sauce on it. They were not accommodating after some nice feedback, so not sure how they will survive if they don't respond to customers."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here for the first time today.  We loved it. Very fresh and great service. We had the Tom ka soup with yellow curry chicken. Great flavor and again, very fresh.  This is our new spot."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff are nice and friendly. But the menu is not accurate for certain dishes. For the pad se ew the menu lists as the entree containing bell peppers but they serve it with broccoli instead. For the pad Thai dish, the menu lists it comes with tofu but they serve it without it. I've mentioned this on several occasions but they keep saying they need to update their menu and just ask for the bell peppers or tofu when I order."}
{"text":"We visited last night. The man who greeted us was probably one of the nicest people I have ever met. They worked hard to make sure all of our needs were met, and service was very fast and efficient. 

The Chon Thai rolls are absolutely delicious with gorgeous plating. The seafood was fresh and succulent. Thai iced tea was smooth and sweet, and the sweet and sour chicken was tender and delicious. 

The restaurant was decorated nicely. I love the openness and use of natural textures. We've been here for Hot Pot, back in the Tien Wong days, and we noticed that some elements have been repurposed  (in a beautiful way).

All in all, this place is a lovely little gem and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We went to Chon Thai with a couple friends. Really liked the food there. We ordered Pad Thai, Pineapple curry and a few other dishes. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service! My family and I will definitely be back. The best Drunken noodles I have ever had."}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this review, unfortunately i had to. I've been eating at Chon Thai since they first opened and lately it has not been good. The portion have always been small which I'm fine with, but its the taste of the food its like eating candy. Its too sweet instead of the savory taste that they use to have. Also, I always order a tom kha from here, but the few times ive ordered, the Chkn is always dry (maybe its time to switch to dark meat) so much onions and a few mushrooms. Its like eating a small bowl of onion soup for $5.99. They're not even cut into small pieces, theyre huge and oh it was really sweet. I loved coming to this place as you can tell from my previous review because the service and the food was good. I feel bad for small businesses probably had to cut back because of the new laws for arizona workers and completely understand you have to make some few cuts, but if the food continues to go down like this, unfortunately I'll have to start going somewhere else :("}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food around in Chandler area. So authentic, tasty, flavorful and fresh! Service here is good too. Courteous staff and quick service. 
We ordered tom yum soup, papaya salad and pad Thai. All delicious and made with minimal oil. Best part about this place is they can make everything on the menu for vegetarians. So yay!"}
{"text":"December, 12,2015 . 

I came back for dinner and my gosh, the owner is simply amazing! The portion of the food is huge! You'll get your moneys worth, and its delicious. My aunt came to visit from Vietnam, she usually don't like Thai food, but I told her to come here and she did. When she ate the food she said it was good, since she came here she rarely ate out, but she did.

As I am waiting, the owner said he has surprise for us. 


If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. 

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"5 stars for GREAT service
5 stars for cleanliness and nice decor
5 stars for the delicious Mango Salad
5 stars for the super affordable prices"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on Saturday. The restaurant looked clean and customer service was wonderful. Didn't like the food much though. We ordered \"Hot\" for everything but the dishes were not spicy at all, they did not even reach medium level at other restaurants. Tom yum soup was not sour enough, it was very salty with too much sugar. Price was good, water was refilled regularly, and staffs did a wonderful job attending us. No complain really, just that the food did not really fit my taste."}
{"text":"amazing! just amazingly great?fried banana ice cream is so good and just for 3.99  the ice cream is the real fruit pineapple ice cream! Love it so much! Strong recommendation !"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for lunch. I had the Thai pineapple chicken Curry. It look great and tasted even better. Nice clean quiet environment. Friendly waiter...we will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Food was very good.  Ordered takeout.  Had the Beef Fried Rice and Chicken rolls.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Like this place a lot! Highly recommend mango with sticky rice...my favorite!"}
{"text":"Had chicken green curry, pad Thai and sticky rice mango. The best bite was the pad Thai. The rice in the dessert was too soggy."}
{"text":"I must say this restaurant for Thai food was great. My only issue when trying this restaurant was when making a to-go order, the lady answered the phone & told me to hold on. Well let's just say I was left on hold for 5mins, I was able to hear her greet customers sitting down but not remembering she did put a call on hold. I still came in to place my order, stated my issue with calling in & she apologized. 

Now when ordering my food, I see the restaurant prefers cash in which you receive a 5% discount which I wasn't aware of but they do take card payments. I order my fav, green shrimp curry HOT with jasmine rice. After waiting a few moments I forgot to ask for a extra scoop of rice. Once letting the rep know I needed more rice she said it'll be $1. By this time I've already paid with card & tipped them the cash I had on my first transaction. Next the lady smirks like, \"You don't have cash?\"; my reply I'm sorry ma'am I used it for your tip. ( kind of wondered if I was left on hold so long, why don't you comp my extra scoop of rice. ) Basically I was waiting for the common courtesy of not charging me since it was a $1. 

Overall the restaurants food was tasty but customer service needs to be looked at better. Smiling doesn't always fix your mistakes made while representing a business."}
{"text":"The food was very good but not exceptional.  We had the drunken noodles, the papaya salad and for dessert, the mango and sticky rice."}
{"text":"An amazing experience. The ambience, music, food and service was top notch. Myself and a couple co-workers sat and chatted for 3hrs because the environment was so inviting. I'll surely be back."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Looks like change of management. Moreover they charge a hidden credit card transaction fee."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere - was happy to see a full vegan menu option! I was opposed to trying a new Thai place and now I want to go back! Great staff. Also met the owner - highly recommend going."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch after church based on yelp reviews. This was our first time and we were not disappointed.   We had the Chon Thai chicken rolls and calamari ring for appetizers.   They were both very good.  My husband had the pineapple shrimp curry and I had the Chon Thai egg noodle as our main dishes.  Both very flavorful.  We will visit this place again."}
{"text":"I ordered the spring rolls, Thai tea, and the Yellow Curry with beef (medium). The spring rolls were standard with the sweet chili sauce. However the Curry was wonderful. To be honest, don't think I could have ordered it spicier. I might be a white girl, but I like some heat. They definitely delivered on the complex flavor of chili (without next day side effects). The wait staff never left us hanging for long. May have to order extra rice if you are like me and don't like soupy rice with my Curry.  The Thai tea was perfectly balanced and a good portion that lasted the meal. 
Ambiance is IKEA hackerspace, but very clean and orderly. 
Will come back to try their Drunken Noodles!"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem on happycow and am greatful we stopped in. I love that they have a separate menu for vegan dishes that they are expanding, and most items can be modified to be vegan. May (the owner) came by to chat with us, she is really sweet and she really understands our diet. I love  atmosphere and decor here. service is quick and friendly. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing food at great prices. My wife and I have been looking for a Thai place to frequent, and even though this place is nearly half an hour away from us, it's worth the drive. Very flavorful curry and their fried rice was fried nicely without too much oil. Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the waitress was sweet and prompt. I would recommend the Red chicken curry. Very good hot tea and nice interior decor."}
{"text":"It is this good, folks. In and out for lunch on a Sunday for less than $20, and I hear the lunch deals during the week are even better. 

Service is a dream -- our server (who I think is also the owner), was so gracious and seemed to genuinely be thankful we were there to eat, even when he was doing something as mundane as pouring water. 

Decor is clean and modern. Concrete floors, but dare I say not a noodle or rice spilled anywhere. Some pretty sweet cover tunes were playing in the background -- think jazz or samba versions of U2 and Pearl Jam. 

Despite all these great aspects to the restaurant, the food still manages to be the star. I had the chicken pik king -- a crispy chicken with green beans and peppers in a curry paste. The boy had the chicken gra pow, and we were both so impressed. The portions were a perfect size and not overwhelming, and the flavors were so subtle and distinct that it was nice not to just be hit with salty or hot or sweet, and actually be able to pinpoint the flavors.

Counting the days until I can grab lunch here again!"}
{"text":"So yummy ! I ordered the green chicken curry Hot, togo. So good ! I just moved back to AZ from Long Beach. I was so bummed about letting my Thai food go. I knew I wasn't going to find good Thai food again. I swear all the Thai places here in Phx, especially the east valley has sucked, but yay for giving this place a try, I loved it! & to top it off their customer service was very good, very sweet people."}
{"text":"I have been in for lunch here many many times. The quality and prices are always constant and inviting.
From the moment that you cross the threshold and are greeted with a warm hello, to the moment you depart, everything is enjoyable.
Their lunch time prices are very reasonable. 
I would strongly recommend reserving judging by the number of people that have lunch there."}
{"text":"The staff was very kind and accommodating by far the highlight of the experience. Regardless of what the staff says though, the fried items are NOT gluten free. The pad Thai did not have the typical noodles and was missing... something. The Panang curry was okay but the beef was very fatty and distracted from the sauce. No alcohol available. It was... eh... I don't know if we'd go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great flavors and menu options. We have not had anything that was disappointing. 
Favorite so far: Crispy garlic chicken!
Or the cashew chicken....so many it's hard to decide."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Thai food and have no regrets. I'm on a journey through Phoenix's Thai eateries so there will be a lot more reviews coming! 
Loved this place. Loved the decor- it was minimal but with historic photos and really fun lamps. 

The food was great- Pad Thai, Panang curry, and Chon Thai Rama chicken. We were feeling adventures and got one mild dish and two medium dishes. I also got a Thai iced coffee. It had a lovely flavor- very different than anything else I've ever had. Pad Thai was delish with a hint of sweetness and spice that built as you ate your food. Chon Thai Rama chicken was pretty good, it wasn't my favorite- I felt like we got a lot of broccoli and not enough chicken. And my favorite favorite dish- Panang Curry- frigging amazing. Spicy, creamy, filling and flavorful. Just get it. And think of me while you eat it. 

Service was very attentive. There was a very friendly gentleman who watched us a little too closely while were eating, it made me a little uncomfortable but not enough to stop stuffing my face. Haha."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thai food and this is so far my favorite place in the valley. We had the green curry and pumpkin curry, and both were outstanding. The vegetables were plentiful and perfectly done and all of the flavors were amazing. I also can't say enough about the service. This is a true family affair and everyone was so genuinely friendly and excited that we enjoyed our meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, great prices and very good curry. They are located in a strip mall but don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"First let me say a 5 star rating going in I was expecting so kind of alcoholic beverage on the menu. The food was great the service was personable and attentive. I ordered Pad Thai shrimp and it was perfectly portioned and deliciously fresh. I will be going there again when in AZ again."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious. 

Ambiance: Soft relaxing music, laid back and quiet. Most important, very clean and comfortable seating. 

Service: outstanding service, very friendly, everyone greeted us with a smile and kept coming back to ask about our needs and they were very sincere. 

Food: Just amazingly delicious. Everything was hot fresh and very flavorful!

We will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner with my daughter at your wonderful restaurant. When I first arrived I was not greeted immediatly though there were servers folding linens however they eventually got to me. The owner/proprietor came over to introduce herself to me and my guest. In fact she came by 4 more times that evening making sure all was right, giving us recommendations and being very service oriented. In fact the entire staff working this evening was incredibly friendly, engaging and outgoing. We ordered some appetizers i.e. Crab Delight. The crab delight was very good and the Calimari was good and yummy. Our entrees which were the curry pumpkin and Pad King Sod Chicken. Both were very good, hot, right amount of Thai Heat and served in a timely manner from the kitchen. Service was excellent. Other than for the warm welcoming greeting they were at the top of their game! The restaurant was clean, inviting and nicely themed and decorated. We will be back and recommend it to others to taste their wide and interesting menu for I believe the experience and service merits the high rating that I have provided them. I do not think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was spectacular. The food was so good, in fact this is my new favorite Thai place. I got the tom kha and the eggplant basil shrimp. Both were amazing. The atmosphere is really pleasant as well. The employees are very nice people and the place is beautifully decorated. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I have been looking for great Pad Thai chicken and I found my spot. Not only that but the service and love that the waitress (owner) shared was above par. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty torn on this one. My husband and I are huge Thai food fans, and this place came highly recommended by Yelp and also by a friend. Not gonna lie, the food was outstanding. I had the gluten free padThai with chicken and by my hubby had the mixed vegetables with chicken. Both dishes were super fresh and came garnished with a nice side salad. The prices were great, too. 

Problem was we waited 45 minutes for our food! It was during the lunch hour and the place was packed, so I am gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and try them one more time. Hopefully next time the service is much better!"}
{"text":"They have a fantastic vegan menu! I love that they can make vegan curries, that one is a rare find without sacrificing flavor. My partner eats of their regular menu and loves it. The staff is always really nice to us, and I love going for the lunch special. But again! Vegan menu!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, customer service was tremendous. Ambiance is better than most Thais. The Tom Ka soup was good but I've had better. I like Tom Ka with more of the lemongrass/lemon flavor than onions. It was a bit heavy on onions for me. Kids meal came with chicken nuggets, I wish they would use real pieces of chicken breast breaded instead. 
Other than those comments food was delicious."}
{"text":"I like to come here for lunch in between my classes break. The food was tasty and the service is excellent. There was a gentleman always walking around to check on customers and was very nice and gentle talking to us (my friend and i). Although my friend does not like their papaya salad much since it comes with a huge portion for an appetizer portion and the dressing was a bit bland for a whole plate filled with vegetable, not shrimp as he thought it would be, I still give a four star and will definitely come back when they have their Mango w/ sticky rice back in stock!"}
{"text":"LOVE this restaurant!!! From the very friendly owner to the excellent food, this has become one of our favorite restaurants. After living in Thailand as a kid, my husband is very picky about his beloved yellow curry. And they nailed it!! 

We eat there at least once a week. Maybe more ;)"}
{"text":"Great food, would come here again. Came here for a family dinner, we all love Thai food and it's one type of food that fits all our different diets. Thai food is pretty easy for vegans, but I was surprised they have a vegan menu complete with vegan apps! We ordered vegan spring rolls which made me happy because I usually can't eat apps with my family. For my meal I ordered the yellow curry with veggies and mild spice. The service was good, the restaurant wasn't that big and was an open space so they were good about checking in with us. It was super tasty and the rest of my family was happy with their dishes as well. Great meal and love that they have a vegan menu!"}
{"text":"I went a week ago for the first time with my husband and daughter. We had such a wonderful time. All of our choices were delicious. The staff is terrific and the restaurant is very clean. I loved my curry dish! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What the heck. This place is so very yummy. We were driving around looking for somewhere to eat. And here we are. I have been avoiding Thai food lately because it all tastes the same but everything here was very distinctly good. The calamari was great the Panangchicken crispy and perfect. We will be back. Sooner rather then later. My five year old cleaned his plate."}
{"text":"Excellent drunken noodles and beef noodle soup, among other great dishes I've had from this restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Second visit to Chon Thai.

Still Five Stars!

This time we tried the yellow curry chicken and the pad Thai.

Great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"The food alone is very good.

One thing I do not like in some of these Asian restaurants is penny pinching. They keep their doors open so that no air-conditioning is need, letting in so many bugs. Do not sit beside the doors.

This is a total failure of management. The wait staff is normally very good."}
{"text":"We finally got around to going to Chon after Jib invited me to dine there. We were greeted warmly upon arrival and offered a seat wherever we wanted. We settled in a cozy little booth and started looking over the menu.

Our waiter came over & suggested that we try out the Chicken Chon Thai Rolls while figuring out what we wanted for our meals. They were delivered to us in a very short while and we dug in right away. The rolls were super tasty, not quite like any other spring roll I've ever had before. The sweet & sour sauce was also really tasty - not too sweet like some sauces I've had at other places. I'd recommend getting these to start off your meal. I definitely want to try the Crab Delight next time too!

For our main meals, we got the Crispy Panang Chicken curry and the Chicken Pumpkin Curry.

The Panang curry was really good. It was served in a cup with rice, vegetables, & the crispy chicken on the side. While I liked everything on the plate and thought it was absolutely delicious, I missed the traditional way that Panang curry is served with everything mixed in so I'd probably get the non-crispy chicken kind next time. As far as the level of spice goes, I ordered medium & thought it had quite a bit of heat but like I mentioned, the sauce was absolutely delicious; I mixed the rice in there & enjoyed away.

The Chicken Pumpkin Curry was an absolute treat too! Neither me nor my boyfriend have had pumpkin curry before & we really enjoyed it. It was thick & creamy and very flavorful with vegetables along with pieces of pumpkin in it. Super tasty! We'd definitely recommend trying it out.

As soon as we were almost done eating, we were served the mango sticky rice for dessert. I've never had it before but it was good. I really like mangoes so I was all about that!

The service at the restaurant is great. Everyone is really friendly & they were really speedy in getting our meal items out, our check, etc. Definitely would recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Finally found a good Thai Restaurant in Chandler!!!  This is the second time we have gone to Chon and both times we have had very good experience. The service is very good. Servers and host are super friendly. The crispy fish we ordered was soooo good. My mouth starts watering just thinking about it. The Pad Thai is also very good. Probably the best I've had in Arizona. They don't serve alcohol but we were told that we can bring our own."}
{"text":"really good food.  Had the Labb, which at medium is pretty spicy, but I wouldn't change it. Also had the thai basil garlic chicken, also really good.   We'll be back to try some other stuff.  
Wait staff were attentive."}
{"text":"Amazing food served by amazing people. We ordered green curry and chicken pad thai. Both were equally awesome!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the East Valley! Best dishes include all of the curries, salads, crispy garlic chicken, pumpkin curry, drunken noodle, and pad thai. The sticky rice is excellent too. Restaurant is clean and light. Staff is warm and attentive."}
{"text":"So glad we found Chon Thai! We have been searching for good Thai food in the area ever since Thai Basil on Guadalupe closed and I think this is our new \"go-to\". We dined in tonight and the service was excellent. Pat was so nice and welcoming and so was the lady that served us but I didn't catch her name. 

We have 2 dishes we use to test Thai restaurants: Pad See Ew and Pad Pik King. Many Thai restaurants don't even offer Pad Pik King but Chon Thai does and it was on point. The Pad See Ew was also excellent and not over saucy. The vegetables were fresh and cooked perfectly. We also indulged in the fried bananas and ice cream which is basically a twist on a banana sundae and I highly recommend it. 

They are offering 10% off during their grand opening so make sure to go support this new local business!"}
{"text":"Ok well the service is slow tonight, but they apologized for their slow service which was ok. But when the food came, omg everything was delicious!
We ordered: 2- Chicken Satay, 2-Calamari, Pad Thai, Fish, Fried Rice, and Beef Curry and for dessert, we devoured the Sticky Rice with Mango.

I regret that Thai Iced Tea. It was good but I'm lactose. Lol

Awesome 10 percent discount.

For the woman's restroom, it has a tall mirror with good lighting for a selfie lol

Every order we received, delish! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Simple but beautiful decorations, clean restaurant (and bathrooms), delicious plates, and overall great value for the money spent! We got the dumplings for an appetizer and they were crispy and delicious! Our entrees didn't take too long to come out and it was delicious! Both servers were attentive, but not hovering. Overall it was really great! The only thing that I didn't really care for was an aftertaste with the water. Despite that, I would definitely recommend and am looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai and dumplings were delicious! Highly recommend for lunch or dinner. Got take out and had to eat in the car as it smelled so good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the Chandler area roughly 4 months ago and we made it a mission to try different restaurants to explore more of Chandler. We found this place on Yelp and all of the views were great so we said, why not. This place was fantastic. Starting from when we stepped foot in the door and left, the service was incredibly attentive and welcoming. Our waters were always filled, and for my husband who drinks so much, so fast, thats a huge bonus for him to never have to wait for more water. The food was incredible and the price was right! I would highly recommend this place and I know for sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am alway one to try new places. The reason I try new places is because of places like this one. It's a small friendly restaurant that puts out great food. The staff is very friendly and it is clean. The prices are very reasonable. They have  only been open 3 weeks and trying to put its mark out there. The service was very fast and I was impressed by the quality of food. This is a place that you need try for yourself. I'm very picky when it comes to Thai and would not steer you the wrong way. I'm giving them 5 Chicken Satays..."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, delicious food, lunch specials, and a super cute interior -- what's not to love? Everything we've tried has been really tasty. I especially liked the Chon Thai Noodle lunch special, egg noodles with shrimp and chicken with a bit of a sour and spicy sauce over lettuce and a sprinkle of cilantro. Portions are very generous so be prepared continue the Thai train for lunch the next day as leftovers."}
{"text":"A great friend of us recommend this restaurant to us, we had great expectations before we got there because of the reviews on Yelp, and guess what they were fulfilled! The service is amazing because you never have to wait long for anything you need, no problem for water refills or rice refills, lol ! 
 The egg rolls are small but delicious perfect for an appetizer !
You are gonna get a big surprise when you get your food, Can you say flavorful!!!!"}
{"text":"Not good. Just spent $40 and had a few bites of each item ordered. Papaya salad tasted and smelled like it was drenched in fish sauce. The Panang tasted watery and soapy. Won't be back.

Update: I emailed the owner, as she requested before 9:00. Have not heard back. Did not do what she promised. Gross and dishonest."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, not amazing but good.  I don't know who said that their hot is real hot because it was kind of wimpy, but fine.

The problem is that we took a large group, and the server was just overwhelmed.  We tried our hardest to make it easy for her but the orders were jumbled, some people got the wrong meats, some got the wrong spices, some got the wrong starters, some got the wrong drinks, a few got the wrong checks...it was a mess.

The price was right and I'm willing to give the food another shot to wow me, but so far...ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh."}
{"text":"Excellent service, very nice. Remodeled location very very friendly staff lunch specials are very inexpensive and very tasty, excellent presentation. Note, not in Comanche, but on Alma School."}
{"text":"I can't believe my luck at finding this new place. I wandered in last night and liked it so much, I'm back for lunch today.
The prices are reasonable, the food is wonderful (4 of 4 entrées tried so far) the service is beyond polite, and the facilities are nicely decorated.
This hidden jem is now part of my regular work week lunch stops. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! They have a whole vegan menu and have the best veganThai tea I've ever. The entire staff is so friendly ."}
{"text":"Beautiful place beautiful service beautiful people. Don't forget to try out their pad Thai and drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Best thai food a must try! Quick service and clean restaurant. The garlic chicken is a amazing."}
{"text":"Love the food and how close to home the location is! We order the pad Thai and Thai fried rice, spice on the side and they get it right every time!"}
{"text":"What a great find! I ordered the yellow chicken curry and it was delicious. Also ordered fried rice & sticky mango rice for dessert all very tasty. It's in the shopping center in the back a little hidden. I didn't see it when I drove through the first time, but came back around I'm glad I did :) Great customer service I will definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Loved it. Calamari was a great appetizer!!!  Tom Kha was excellent!  Really great drunken noodles with shrimp.  My daughter had the papaya salad and veggie tom yum soup and loved them both."}
{"text":"This is a fairly small store front place, nicely decorated and clean. Gets a little bit busy, but worth the wait. The food is consistently above average, and the service is excellent. Very friendly and attentive. Everything was delicious, although I have had better drunken noodles at other places. The beef was a little tough, and it lacked flavor. However, the beef in the curry was tender and delicious. They get five stars because of the overall excellent quality of the food and the service."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food! My wife and I are picky about our Thai food, have tried countless different Thai food places across Chandler, Tempe, and Phoenix, but this is ALWAYS our go-to spot. We're here multiple times a month at varying times and always receive excellent service and fantastic food. We've tried numerous items on the menu and can vouch for all of them--great, delicious, I've never been more satisfied. I honestly can't express enough how much we love the food here. Please give it a try--lunch specials and dinner options are both affordable $ and well-worth trying!"}
{"text":"The food was good at lunch at the beginning of March! I ordered the Pad Thai. Tasty. In fact, I wanted to order it again many times in the last month but choose not to.

The issue is the non-cash debit card fee when I was done with my meal. I see the owners are saying City of Mesa is charging now, gas station, movie theatre, whatever. It doesn't matter who else is charging, it matters about your customer and your place of business. Why lose a customer, which I will probably never eat here again, over such a small fee? It looks like others are following suit on Yelpers and not coming back. It's causing more grief than just gain repeat visitors. 

Take me for example, I would've came back about 3 times in the last 2 months if it wasn't for this simple fee. Both times for dinner we spent $66 at another Thai place and another $91 at the same place. And the third time is a lunch that was $38. That's close to $200 just from one family to another Thai place down the street. You are losing business over this and it's going to bite you in the end.

I want to visit your location. I want to eat your food. Let me! I'd be willing to pay a higher price, in fact. But listen to some of what your customer is saying, not just what others business owners are doing around you."}
{"text":"Have had dinner here a couple of times and absolutely fantastic. The food is fresh and hot, prepared with presentation in mind. When asked what level of spice, be careful because they are spot on when it comes to spice. If you want it hot, you will get. All of the dishes have their own identity and taste separate from each other. The staff are very friendly and always willing to answer questions. The portions are very good, you will not leave hungry. We have eaten at several Thai restaurants in the area and this is by far one of the best."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai Food!

My diet is Vegan and they have an entire menu for Vegans!

The boyfriend is not Vegan, and he loves everything he gets. I personally love their curries, fried tofu, spring rolls, and fried rice."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Thai places I've found in the East Valley. Tucked away into a little nondescript strip mall, we actually turned into two different strip malls before we found the right one (totally on us--we were starving and impatient, as is tradition). 

We were greeted and sat immediately, with only two other tables in the restaurant taken, and who left soon after we arrived. Granted, it was 2pm on Christmas Eve, and maybe Thai is not the most popular choice at that time. But the staff were friendly and quick to help us, and answered all of our questions about food allergies and such. For the record, almost all of their dishes can be made gluten free, and our server made certain to double check with the chef on a dish she wasn't 100% sure on. 

We ended up going with the drunken noodles with chicken and the chicken pumpkin curry, both mild, and of course with two thai teas to pair. The portion sizes for both dishes were pretty hefty; larger I'd say than most Thai places in the area. The drunken noodles were really good, not too oily and not shy with the basil. The chicken pumpkin curry was amazing. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, and normally red curry isn't my go-to, but this was awesome and I'd absolutely get it again, no doubt about it. The sweetness of the Thai pumpkin played really well with the spices in the curry, and they are generous with the amount of chicken included. Just a fair warning: we ordered this mild, and it was definitely pretty spicy. I'd say I'd probably rank it at a medium-hot on a normal Thai spicy scale. Still, it was the flavorful kind of spicy, and definitely didn't deter from the taste. 

I will definitely be back--I've got to get my Thai tea fix somehow, and that pumpkin curry is unique enough to keep me wantin' more."}
{"text":"We weren't disappointed.  The atmosphere was very nice, the staff was very helpful and their suggestions were right on.  We had the Shrimp Pad Thai and the Garlic Chicken both were delicious.  I especially liked the brown rice, it appeared to be several varieties of brown rice mixed together and had a wonderful nutty flavor.  Our favorite dessert, Mango and Sticky Rice was beautifully presented and delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the mouth watering Thai flavors and spices that were lovingly cooked into three amazing dishes I tried on my first visit.

The pineapple rice was the best I have ever had. Fresh pineapple chunks and some spices that danced in your mouth with good hang time well after you swallow that deliciousness!  

The broth of the Tom Yum was so good on it's own. Don't get too spicy, you can always add but you can't take away spice and heat.

There was a sucker-butt lady that was complaining about the heat level and wanting to send her dish back. Haters gonna hate. So go 2 on the spice or go zero and bring your A-1 sauce lady! 

The Pad Se Ew was very tasty too. The place is not cheap, but the value is there when you consider portion sizes are generous and they don't skimp on ingredients or cut corners. 

Last item of biz. \"May\" was very sweet and made you feel like family and she shared several other restaurants in the area if you want to try Korean, Pho and World Markets like Lee Lee Market down the street. 

Great service, great staff, and food. they have lunch specials too. 

This is top on my list in the area for great Thai food and experience."}
{"text":"The wife and I were craving some Thai food so we stopped in.  I did read that this place is under new ownership so it concerned me and it appears that way.  This is the pros and cons of this place. We ordered the special of the day which are Tom Yum Chicken with vegetables soup and their version of Pork Steak with their special sauce. I ordered their dinner portion of their Mussaman Curry.

Pros:
The portion size is quite large if you like quantity versus quality.
The tom yum soup is also pretty great and very flavorful.

Cons:
The mussaman curry is bland and only tasted of coconut milk with minimal spice. The vegetables and potatoes were not cooked and still firm.  There was really nothing special with the pork steak. It was just a pan-fried pork chop with their special fish sauce.

Also, if you plan to pay with credit card, you will pay their \"non-cash fee.\" They do offer 5% discount if you pay cash.

Overall,  I prefer quality than quantity.  Would I recommend coming back? Most likely not. I would only come back if it was a rainy day with cash in my wallet to buy their soup or if I was sick and too lazy to cook soup.  I would not go out of my way to order their food."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I had a date here. We enjoyed it. There were a few hiccups but overall we had no major complaints, hence the four stars.

The good:
- Each table has a cup of tiny Jenga that you can play with. At least.. it looked exactly like Jenga?! So that was entertaining.
- The restaurant was clean and well-decorated.
- Prices were OK, not dirt cheap but they were bigger portions than usual Thai restaurants!
- Food came out surprisingly fast.

The not-so-good:
- We ordered the spiciest level for all our dishes and they forgot to make one dish even a tiny bit spicy. I have a feeling they accidentally gave our dish to someone else since they seemed surprised it hadn't come out yet.
- They charge you a no-cash fee without giving any notice so I ended up paying a few dollars more since I paid with a card. Some notice would have been appreciated. 

Other notes:
- The crispy garlic chicken tastes really good.. It has the consistency of Korean-style fried chicken. I really enjoyed that.
- The green curry is less thick than the usual. Maybe that's why it came out so fast? 
- The pad thai was not that impressive. I am usually hard to please because I have really high standards for pad thai. This one was just OK. They use the thin kind of noodles for it.
- The green curry and the garlic chicken dish both come with little plates of rice.

I would definitely come back since we had a nice time overall! I would love to try the Thai tea next time.

BTW, if you like spicy food or are used to crazy Asian-level spiciness, don't be afraid to get the highest level. Yes - get the one that's hotter than the 'Thai hot' level. All I can say is - we are still in white-washed Arizona and you have nothing to fear. It isn't even that spicy."}
{"text":"The thai iced tea is super yummy and the dishes were quite tasty (salmon curry?  who knew?).  Where things fell down was the service after we received our food.  We had a heck of a time getting the attention of our waitress to get our check.  She busily cleaned around us but seemingly never looked up to see if we needed something else, were ready to go, etc.  We are patient folk and I think we sat there for about ten minutes before I was able to grab her.  This seemed to be in direct conflict with the fantastic service we received upon arrival."}
{"text":"We can't review the food as after 45 minutes we still hadn't been served. The staff seemed pleasant. The restaurant itself was clean and typical Thai decor. Furniture is white plastic tables and chairs. However, at no time during our wait did any staff come to explain the delay in receiving our food. After 30 minutes we inquired as to the delay in receiving our appetizers and were told there was a problem with the \"stove\". Fifteen minutes later still no appetizer nor any communication from the staff. We decided to leave since we were not given any idea of when our food would arrive. All I can advise is if you go ask first if the kitchen is in working order.
I'm used to a member of the staff coming  over to communicate if there's a problem in the kitchen and offer some options as to what they can provide or possibly comp for the problematic service."}
{"text":"We dined at this restaurant on 9/04/2016 AD.

I would recommend coming to this restaurant after sunset; the ambiance transforms into a more elegant place. The ambiance changes so radically because, the windows of the restaurant don't have any tint, so it feels like you are eating at a brightly lit park. This sort of kills it for me when planning a, \"date night\" - the key word being, \"night\". After sunset the accent lighting of the restaurant becomes the primary light source and changes the mood entirely.

The establishment was clean, well decorated and the service was efficient and friendly. They don't serve any alcohol so be sure to have a cocktail or other adult beverage prior to arriving. The menu as of this review, is only one page, which helps to keep it simple and highlight the best dishes. The food was delicious, the prices were fair and the portions were decent.

I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner. If you want the maximum experience for, \"date night\", then arrive after the sun has set."}
{"text":"My mom and I found this place via Yelp. We were looking for a Thai restaurant that had Som Tum/papaya salad. Not many places have this or sticky rice, so we went and it was delicious. Mind you my mom was also a Thai restaurant chef for 10 years, yes we're Thai. She loved the larb, som tum, sticky rice, and  dessert. As did I. The satay was not quite how I remembered it but it wasn't bad. The prices were average so that seemed fair. I liked the location and it was lovely and modern decor. Intimate for date night and could be casual. I LOVED our waitress, she was older and reminded me of my mom too. She and my mom conversed in Thai but I don't speak it so it was nice to see my mom get her Thai practice in. The chef also came out to ask some tables how they enjoyed their meals, that was nice to see. Higjly recommend and We will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in to place a to go order.  Staff promptly helped me and got my order right in.  Food was great when I got it home.  Place looked to be clean from what I could see from the front door.  They also gave me a 5% discount for paying in cash.  That was a nice surprise.  Next time I'll dine in though so I can update my review and hopefully make it more interesting!"}
{"text":"Updating my review because we've tried almost everything and have yet to be disappointed. There is always plenty on the plate and the presentation is beautiful. We are almost always greeted like old friends by the staff. They are getting busier during lunch (which is our favorite time to go) but that's what happens when you tell people about an awesome place, with great food, and a staff that is always glad you came."}
{"text":"Ordered the Red Chicken Curry and it was delicious! Service was great and so was the interior of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good, but not in the best 10% of Thai places. Clean and organized. Good service. Food tastes good. I eat on the spicier side; so, was disappointed that when I ordered hot, it was not spicy. Will I return? Yes. 

The garlic chicken is a good intermediate for those who do not want spicy food, but want some of flavor accents.

{"text":"Ordered food from office for mostly vegetarian people . We placed order for 2 different rolls . One was vegetarian and other was chicken. Beside this chicken roll one more entree was chicken item . Everything else was vegetarian item. We asked them to mark the meats items. The roll marked as chicken had two vegetarian rolls and one chicken roll. And the roll marked as vegetarian had two chicken roll and one vegetarian roll. After making sure they know that order was placed for vegetarian ... they messed it up in a really weird way . Thai basil chicken i ordered was average . Chicken roll was gross :(... and most of the veggie items were not good . Disappointed!! Will never order again!"}
{"text":"Friendly people and great food! Highly recommend this place to fulfill your Thai craving! We had the pad Thai, fried rice, and a recommendation by the waitress. So yummy. They accidentally forgot our pad Thai order but we're super nice and apologetic about it. They had great service and kept up with filling our drinks and water. Very welcoming upon coming in."}
{"text":"I really liked this place I went there with the wife and my son we had a good time. My wife does not like Thai food. She ended up really liking this place though. It was a win for me because I love Thai food. So now we can eat thai food together!!!"}
{"text":"Just had my normal Pad See-Ew. Super Delicious as usual. The Owner is also amazing and has some superb staff. Rest of the family had the Fried rice and the Pad Thai and all loved it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not fantastic - Not horrible.  Soup was super-weak, basically water. Our food was fine, though my son said the spiciness level was NOT as hot as they warned.  They lets us order Thai Tea then had to come back to let us know they had run out of it.  Wasn't impressed enough to return."}
{"text":"We happened upon this sparking clean place. We had the mango salad and green curry; both were very good! The wait staff was very friendly and funny!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is our first time trying this place... and let me say.. it's AMAZING!!!! What a hidden gem (which I say that because I only heard about it on yelp but driving by that's a place I wouldn't ever see since the location is in a smaller complex with not a lot of businesses) I am currently eating dinner while writing this because they are so good! I got the garlic chicken.. obsessed! I could eat this 3 times a week! Super fresh and just amazing flavor. The fried rice was delicious as well. And of course we had to get the mango sticky rice dessert.. and it was too die for! Overall this will be our new \"Chinese\" food craving. And we're so excited to explore different items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I drive all the way from north Scottsdale to come to my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. The service is exceptional, the food is fresh and full of flavor, and reasonably priced. Give it try, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This is awesome Thai food! My boyfriend and I went for the first time and fell in love. Usually we get take out, but the restaurant ambiance is great to eat in as well. Usually we stick to Pad Thai and the Drunken Beef noodles and they are phenomenal. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! The front house opened the door for us when we entered and left. The service was so great and friendly! The fried rice was okay but the chicken pad thai and ground chicken entree was so delicious! I highly recommend coming here not only for the tasty and delicious food but also for the great service!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Do not be fooled by the strip mall and the simple decor.  Went for lunch.  Service is friendly and the food was very good.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is legit. We got the crispy fried chicken and the pad Thai. The garlic chicken was the highlight. Sooo good! Is was crisp fried, topped with fried garlic and fried basil. The only other way I could describe it is spicy orange chicken with a kick. But better. The pad Thai was excellent. The ladies are so sweet too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Either people don't know good Thai or it was an off night... drunken beef noddles was tasteless. Asked for very spicy and it wasn't spicy at all. The pad Thai was also tasteless and in the little taste it did have, didn't taste like a typical pad Thai. It was hard to flag down servers and we asked for refills on water multiple times that didn't happen."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time for lunch today. Our experience was exceptional. Attentive service, clean restaurant, beautifully presented delicious food. I had the green curry chicken and my husband had chon Thai egg noodles with chicken and shrimp, both with medium heat. I love spicy foods and the medium heat was just right. I would maybe be adventurous and try medium and a half (if that is a thing). 

This is a real local gem! They have take out and delivery, are vegetarian and allergy friendly. Try it out and spread the word."}
{"text":"Chon Thai Food has the best, separate whole vegan menu! 
Three of us ordered the Drunken Noodle, Orange Cauliflower, Eggplant Tofu Basil, Mussanman Curry, Coconut Thai coffee and Thai tea. All of the dishes are very delicately flavored, cook to perfection! We finished everything with nothing to take home. We are so grateful to have local businesses like Chon Thai food that offer so many vegan options."}
{"text":"Different from any Thai place I've had in Phoenix (eg Thai Rama, Thai basil, Thai elephant)

I loved the flavor of the curries and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place WAS pretty decent. It seems they have cooks with different cooking styles. I had the X2 Crispy Panang Chicken twice. First time AMAZING. Second time overcooked and lacking flavor.  Many of the dishes don't even look the same as they did 6 months ago. The dishes almost taste like they come from different restaurants.  I don't know what they decided to put in the  A2 Chicken Spring Rolls (3), but horribIe. They have a strange pungent taste We have never tasted anything like this in a Thai setting. They were not good. 

I read they were bought out. If so, new owners are not keeping up the good food. Disappointed.

This is the 2nd Thai restaurant we like that seems to have been bought out and declined in flavor and quality. Hopefully not a trend. Now to start over again looking for decent Thai food in the East Valley  :-("}
{"text":"Great Thai Food not overly overpriced. Papaya Salad was pretty good. The service is very friendly. I have only had take out there but the atmosphere inside the restaurant seems very nice. We also had Chicken Fried Rice and Panang Chicken. I would go back and try some other dishes hopefully to dine in."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff.. However if did take a while for are food to get to us.. 30 mins :-/ kinda long when your hungry.. But it was worth the wait"}
{"text":"There are no words that can describe the level of perfection this place brings to Thai food. If you're debating, stop. Eat here...immediately."}
{"text":"I have had several items here. The pineapple shrimp curry, and others. I like them all. I like the service, I like the owner, and the quality of the food is great!"}
{"text":"I brought my family, sister and nephew to Chon's Thai, and enjoyed amazing Thai cuisine.  The decor of the restaurant was warm and inviting.  Better yet, there were tasty offerings for both the traditional and Vegan diners in our group.  We were surprised by the exclusive and extensive offerings on their separate Vegan menu, available on request, photo posted.  I loved the Pad See Ew with Tofu, and my daughter raved about her Mixed Veggies Deluxe.  I and my daughter would highly recommend this restaurant to the Vegan and vegetarian community.  And, according to the rest of my family, their traditional Thai offerings were amazing too.  My wife had the Tofu Pad Thai with extra Peanut sauce, and she loved it!  Portion sizes are generous, and the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend,  five stars!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant!!! Very affordable prices, amazing food, and the friendliest staff! The Tom Kha and Crispy Garlic Chicken are our faves! I can't get over how nice everyone is here... I love it!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley. I crave this place weekly. Go-to items: Yum nua, crispy garlic chicken, basil fried rice & pad se ew with a Thai tea. So so so good!!"}
{"text":"Cold nights require warm spicy foods, I yelped Thai food and this gem came up. Family owned restaurant, great atmosphere, AMAZING FOOD. We order the fried calamari as an appetizer. Followed by the beef pagnang curry, the shrimp and pineapple curry, the chicken and shrimp red curry, the Thai pumpkin curry and the pad-see-ew w shrimp. Each dish was incredibly flavorful, fresh, and steaming hot! BEST Thai food in Chandler hands down!"}
{"text":"The only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is because the food took FOREVER to come out. Like we ordered appetizers twice before the food came out slow that evening. The food was amazing though and the service was very friendly even though they were really busy. The garlic chicken I ordered was on the specials portion of the menu but it really reminded me of orange chicken which was good but I was hoping for something else. Their papaya salad was really good and even the medium packed a little heat. The calamari and sauce it comes with was very similar to calamari from kona grill which is not a bad thing because it tastes amazing. We also got a seafood salad to share with the family and that was amazing too. Overall awesome restaurant though I'll have to swing by again and try their curry."}
{"text":"Take out order was very good. We ordered chicken pad Thai, chicken satay, and pla lui soun (Crispy trout fish on top of mango salad). The fish fish was something new for me and was a pleasant surprise. The batter was very crispy and they kept the salad apart from the fillet in the to-go order which was thoughtful. Spice level seemed low: pad was hot and pla lui spun was medium but both seemed a level down from that."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Thai veggie and drunken noddles are amazing. My husband had the sweet chicken and hated it. The sweetness over powered the hotness and ruined the dish. We are a house divided but give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is relaxing, the food is tasty, service is quick, and the price is right. It's not, like, the most absolutely incredible, mind-numbingly good Thai food I've ever eaten, but it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"The food was great as well as the service. The ambiance was exceptional. The price was about average and won't break the bank. The service was top notch and the order didn't take long to get to the table. They are newly opened and for now they are offering a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Wow! Glad I found this place :))
Service was awesome and the food was delightful. Too bad some jerk had to break their door. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came from Mesa to get lunch at Chon Thai today, and they did not disappoint! We got the Massaman Curry, Pad See Ew, and the Pineapple Fried Rice. Oh, and the golden tofu and the spring rolls. Everything was delicious! They have a separate vegan menu, which is awesome, but it's somewhat limited, since many or most of the items on the regular menu can be made vegan, even though they're not listed on the vegan menu. So, this is a great place to come, whether you're vegan or coming with a group of friends with mixed diets! The restaurant itself is clean and spacious. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning food.  Preparation, presentation, service.  Use of spices and fish sauce artfully prepared.  Thai Beef salad out of this world and we will be back.  You will not regret it"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the customer service, despite the place being so overly packed. The owner kept apologizing for the delay but we were too busy being amazed of how beautiful the place was. 

We ordered the fried tofu, chicken pad thai, and tom yum chicken. The presentation of each food was extravagant, not your typical thai food. The fried tofu was delicious, nice and crunchy on the outside~ nice and soft on the inside, not mushy... big plus. The pad thai was a little bland. I would think of it more as stir fried noodles. It didn't really taste like pad thai. It was more sour than sweet, without the lime. The tom yum was too sour for consumption. Overall, the food was good, but not your real thai tasting food.

Again, I really did enjoy the experience of this restaurant. The customer service was incredible."}
{"text":"I have ordered the crispy garlic chicken very good. I was surprised with the crunch of the basil. So yummy. My go to new Asian spot. Always very friendly. Have not done a sit down yet, all order out. Also their lettuce wraps are good."}
{"text":"The food here is on point! This was our first time at Chon Thai and will not be our last. My mom got yellow curry with chicken and I got pad see ew with chicken. Both dishes were so flavorful! The curry was rich without being too sweet and the pad see ew was just the right amount of bold and had fresh broccoli. May, the owner, was very friendly, as was the rest of the staff, and took lots of time to chat with us and explain the subtle differences between all the curries on the menu. I think I found my new favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Always a good meal and terrific service.  Prices are very reasonable.  Great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing! The entire staff super friendly and love to serve with smiles! We had the eggplant and shrimp... Simply UNBEATABLE FLAVOR! Take all your family and friends to this restaurant it sure to please the pickiest palate!"}
{"text":"Bookmarked this on yelp and finally got to try it a few days ago. And I had ordered more today to pick up. The food is absolutely amazing, very flavorful and delicious! I had pad thai and pineapple fried rice and both were amazing. I usually eat spicy at least a level 3 or 4 at other places, but when I first tried level 3 here with my pineapple fried rice it was extra spicy, good but spicy. So today I got a 2 for my pad thai and it was the perfect spice for me. Even without spice in their pad thai was still super flavorful and amazing! I can't get over their food, hands down this place is officially my favorite thai restaurant. 

In addition, service was amazing as well as their restaurant. Very cute setting inside where you could dress casual or business casual. Nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"A great place for a delicious lunch.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They were more than glad to make recommendations and share ingredients."}
{"text":"This recently opened and is across the street from us, so we decided to give it a chance.  Great idea!  The service was excellent and the man who was probably the owner, could not have been more gracious and appreciative.  I ordered the green curry and substituted tofu for the meat, which they were happy to do for me.  This was hands down the best I have had anywhere.  Loved it!  My husband ordered the Drunken Noodles with beef and also was thrilled.  I am so glad this is across from me and can't wait to be back!  Definitely a keeper!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner is this sweet little man who truly cares about every single customer he gets. The food is given such detail and care, you can tell that they have pride in what they do. If you like Thai, give them a try! Great service!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have ever had, and I have had Thai food all over the world.I'm visiting my mom and took her out to dinner here. I had the Pineapple Shrimp Curry and she had the Eggplant/Shrimp. Both were exquisite! We ordered it medium and it was nice and spicy. The ingredients danced upon the palette in a symphony of flavor. I'd come here once a week if I lived here. My mom will be sure to be back, and she's delighted to have discovered such a great place."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT....A great Thai restaurant that doesn't sacrifice flavor just to be spicy.  The dishes my wife and I ordered were Thai spicy but was very flavorful and well balanced.  The decor is minimum and pleasant, but complimented the background music which had popular songs being redone in a swanky lounge singer vibe.  This is one new restaurant you MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Their weekly lunch deal was amazing! You get a side soup or salad, rice, red curry chicken loaded with tender white meat and fresh veggies, and a crab wonton for $7...everything was really delicious and excellently seasoned. The service was great too, all of the staff was so friendly! This is my new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I am on travel from SFO and was looking for real good food. Somehow I found this place.

I would say this's the best Thai food I have ever had. If you're in Phoenix/ Mesa, definitely try here.

The folks here are also very friendly as well"}
{"text":"We ate here last night. We arrived at around 6:30pm and the restaurant was half full. In about 30 minutes, the restaurant was completely occupied. 
As soon as we arrived, we were greeted and asked to choose any seat we wanted. We chose a table and took some time to review the menu. We weren't sure what to order for appetizers so it took us a little while to decide. Eventually when the waitress came, we asked her about the salads and we decided to order the beef salad which she said would be good for two. We also ordered Pad See Eew chicken and the beef drunken noodles. On the menu, the eggs were scratched off the drunken noodles and I asked the waitress if it would indeed be taken out and she said yes and I explained that this would be good because I do not want eggs in my food. 
The salad came out shortly after we ordered and it was fresh and looked really good but was slightly over seasoned with salt. Nevertheless we ate the whole thing because we were very hungry. 
The food was served almost half way through our salad & it looked great; the presentation was nice. We dug in, food is hot and delicious. I enjoyed every bite of my drunken noodles until I found there was eggs in it. I was somewhat disappointed because I have a sensitivity towards eggs but I did not call the waitress to let her know about that and unfortunately no one came to ask us how we were doing during our meal even though our water cups were refilled. I pushed the eggs to the side of my plate and ate the whole thing because it was really good. I also tried a few bites from my husband's meal and it was really good!
When the waitress came to collect our empty plates after we were working on our bill, she asked us how everything was and I showed her the egg leftovers. She was surprised to see them and apologized. I explained that I have a sensitivity (but not an allergy) so I won't get super sick however they needed to be careful about this. 
Overall, very good food and service. Prices are average. We would probably go back if we were in the area again and I would recommend it to others for sure."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant via the Yelp app. First look, the décor was modern and nice. The server was very polite and recommended a dish that we didn't order. We started our meal with the  Calamari rings appetizer. These were okay, just the average Calamari fair with sauce. Our entrées included the Eggplant basil shrimp and the Panang curry beef. Both were okay but I'm thinking we should have ordered what the server recommended.  The food didn't stand out for me, but the service was wonderful! They even held the door open for us when we left!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai dishes artfully presented in a gracious setting.  From the moment I walked in I felt welcomed.  The service was very gracious.  They have an excellent selection of dishes which you can have prepared with your choice of meat/shrimp/tofu and with your preference of heat level.  The dishes came out very quickly and were beautifully presented.  Even the salad was an artistic presentation and delicious with crisp apples and cucumbers.  I had the cashew shrimp and found it to be beyond my expectations.  A very generous serving expertly prepared with crisp vegetables and lots of cashews. I selected medium heat and it was perfect.  I went for lunch and was in and out in 30 minutes.  Great place for lunch.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Took my very hard to please family members here for lunch on Christmas Eve. Upon sitting down, my mom made a comment \"Don't order too much... let's get a few items first and if it tastes good, we'll order more\". LOL. 

I'm happy to report they ordered more! We had about 12 people in our party and every single one enjoyed the food... YAY! It was such a relief. Everyone chose several items and we passed them around family style. Everything was really good!

Definitely must orders- Pad Gra Pow, Crab Fried Rice, & Chicken Satay
Also really good- Beef Noodle Soup, Papaya Salad, Pumpkin Curry
Good, but not as good as the other items above- Green Curry, Chicken Fried Rice, Pad Thai

We've gone back a 2nd time since and it was still as good as the first time. I haven't had anything here I did not like. 

The restaurant is really nice & cozy. The staff are super nice! The gentlemen (I think he's the owner) kept checking with us throughout the meal, shook our hands and thanked us for coming in and even opened the door for us when we were leaving! Wow! I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"The flaors are a bit strong for me. I feel like they have a heavier hand in salt and or sugar depending on the dish. We went as a group and ate family style. We ate panang curry, pad thai, pad see ew, a soup and a stir fry. Their pad thai is traditional tamarind based which I personally am not used to. Their curry seemed thick but tasty, their soup was sweet when is normally supposed to be sour. They charge close to ab extra $3 to use a credit card. Nowadays, businesses absorb this but not this one. Restaurant was very clean, service was decent, food was ok. Probably won't go again."}
{"text":"Best Thai  Restaurant in Chandler! The crab fried rice a bomb.com
The green curry is killer."}
{"text":"Pad see yew flat noodles with beef! Thai iced tea and coffee! Vegetable fried rice! Dumpling were nice but i feel like they should give you 10 instead of 6. Great food either way."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of curry dishes, and their Pad Thai was also pretty good. I ordered the Yellow Curry, made it 'hot' as requested. Tasted great. I'll be returning most definitely!"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Chon Thai! So glad that I did. Dinner was amazing. We started off with spring rolls and chicken satay. Both were delicious! Spring rolls were crispy and presented beautifully. 

Ordered the panang curry with beef, medium, as my entrée. Wow! I highly recommend it. We had a little one with us. He ate all of the decorative orange slices off of the plates and enjoyed the kids chicken fried rice. He commented to one of the servers that his food was amazing! 

Oh! And the thai iced tea is top notch!! I've had some very disappointing thai tea at other places... This tea raised the bar to new heights for me. 

My last comments are about the staff. What a lovely bunch of people. Everyone was so welcoming and kind. I felt completely at ease and appreciated as a customer. Very attentive, helpful and happy group. I'll be back, without a doubt. It's worth the drive from Tempe. I'll happily pass every other thai food place that I see, just to get here!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food!! After having read all of the very positive reviews, I decided to give this restaurant a try.. I had, as an appetizer, the calamari.. They were perfectly fried, accompanied by an awesome sauce. My entree was the Pineapple Shrimp Curry. It was perfectly seasoned. Although, it was very good, I did not quite finish it, because I wanted my dessert. I had Fried Banana With Ice-cream. The portion was huge AND delicious.. I took half of my dessert home. 
I have found my favorite Thai Restaurant in Chandler.. Give it a try. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant owner is extremely friendly; that is the first thing I noticed walking into this restaurant. I had read the reviews that the food is quite good, so I was not worried about having a good meal here. I tried their Pad Thai with shrimp, vegetable spring rolls, and Thai iced tea. The Pad Thai was quite authentic and comes with 5 levels of spiciness. I chose 2 but would recommend most people to go with 1 or less if you do not like spicy Pad Thai. The spring rolls were crispy and flavorful. Lastly, the Thai iced tea is also quite authentic, and I liked the fact that it was not overly sweet either. Overall, the restaurant ambiance and the friendly owner made the meal even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing great for date night. I everyone there was so friendly I had the pumpkin curry super delicious. And they have all levels of spice so I'm a weakling I went with their mild and it was just right"}
{"text":"Though it is a bit of a drive, Chon Thai was recently recommended to me. Wow, was it worth the drive. The curry was fantastic and the service was impeccable. In fact, I would go so far as to say the best service I've had! As we left my girlfriend said she wished she could bring our waiter home with her to teach her boys a thing or two about manners! I concur. Worth every bit of the drive."}
{"text":"I was super happy with my experience at Chon Thai. First, the atmosphere is really cute. They were very busy, but that did not affect our service because the service was excellent. I had the best soup: It was the tom yum soup and it had huge chunks of veggies in it and delicous flavor. My husband and I are both vegan and they knew right away what modifications to make. I love eggplant in thai dishes and their eggplant is the bomb. I just subbed out the shrimp for tofu. Nice and large portion sizes and I had plenty of leftovers. We will be going back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Best drunken beef noodles I've ever had. Also very good Thai tea and spring rolls. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food a great price with amazing service, does it get any better? 
I had lunch with a friend here and we both ate for under $16. 
The servings are more than generous, veggies fresh and all white meat chicken. 
I ordered the ginger chicken dish, medium heat and it was pretty spicy for me. Next time I'll go mild and there will be a next time. 
Great job, thank you!"}
{"text":"Used to love this Thai place but not anymore. The last time we take out food from them we ordered 2 Thai Chicken Curry Mild and Medium. We didn't eat it. Too much spice. We asked them once that we don't like too much spice but they insist. Lol Very Dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious flavorful Thai food. Got the panang beef, yum nua, and pad prikh king. Everything was so yummy! Meat was good quality, curry flavorful. Got spicy level 4 and was warned it was spicy, they were right but it was the perfect level for me (I tend to like food on the spicier side). Will be back for sure :-)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic service wise. I ordered some to go food and while waiting my son and I were served water and ice cream. On my way out the girl walk us to my car with the food. Best genuine service I've ever had. Can't wait to go home and try the food. We will definitely come back and have a sit down dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with high expectations after the raving reviews but was disappointed ... Their website n online menu says they have trout fish but in real they only have cat fish !!! Food was mediocre below par ordered pad thai with tofu... V average taste n burnt fried tofu with no vegetables have to sent back .. Came back with raw not seasoned vegetables ... Hubby ordered basil fried rice with shrimp which has two shrimp n bland tasting ... Only good part was tall manager who was very nice and friendly but i guess their cook need some serious improvement !! And yes the calamari appetizer was totally tasteless like stale have to sent back ... Manager was nice and admitted all seafood is frozen .... Would not go back .."}
{"text":"Food was good, but we'll never order from here again. My wife has severe allergies to some foods and on our delivery order they simply refused to honor our requests. She's deathly allergic to eggs and they put eggs in everything we ordered, so she ended up ordering pizza. I asked for my dish to not be spicy and they made both of them spicy as hell. 

How hard is it to not put an egg in some noodles? It's not like the noodles laid the egg. How hard is it to not make everything so damn spicy? Don't put \"mild\" on your menu as a choice if you can't actually do it.

A nice enough place, but if they can't handle \"hold the eggs\" we can't risk ordering from here again and having our dinner plans (or worse!) ruined."}
{"text":"Looking for something new to try, my boyfriend and I love local, family own restaurants so we decided let's give Thai food a try. Looking at yelp at all the different Thai places this one caught my eye right away. The menu has a good amount of options but what caught my eye was curry. I always wanted to try curry and I'm so glad that I want here. My boyfriend and I first had wonton soup and it was the best wonton soup we ever had. (And We're from New York we grew up with wonton.) For the entree I had yellow curry, medium spic with chicken and shrimp and it was sooo good that I had to force myself to stop eating before I get a stomachache from eating to much. My boyfriend had Thai basil fried rice with chicken, beef and vegetables and he absolutely loved it. Plus both plates had a good amount of portions for leftovers the next day. Which if you're like me and have work early you don't have time to make a good lunch so leftovers is a must. Also the environment was clean, nice and the service was wonderful. Oh and right now if you pay cash you get a little discount."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant! My order has never been wrong (and we order here a lot!), we have never had any complaints with the food or the service!! They are very kind as well! Thank you Chon Thai!!"}
{"text":"I found Chons Thai on Yelp and have tried lunch twice now with my wife and it was excellent. I had red curry one time, yellow another and it was both an aesthetic dish and good tasting. Pricing was modest, atmosphere was pleasing, and staff were very nice. I can hardly wait to have dinner there. I recommend Chons Thai food."}
{"text":"The people here are literally hilarious, and that's just half the reason that it is now my favorite Thai restaurant. I got the Thai iced tea, perfect, and the crispy garlic chicken. The lady's description was \"it's crispy, garlic, has crispy basil leafs, and need to be protected from your family's forks, they will try to steal it\" she was right. The portions are big enough to share, or keep to yourself. The sticky rice is fantastic as well. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Really good place with simple decor, amazing food and great hospitality.
Very impressed with the lunch portion. Although service took little extra time but I have no complaints since they are quite new in business. The green curry chicken was good and to the right spice balance I asked for. I will definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Chon Thai apparently is under new management.  They say they are using the same recipes, but it doesn't taste the same to us.  Perhaps the original chef changed things without noting on the recipes.  I don't know.  But it's different.  And not as good.

The crispy panang, which was a must-have, wasn't right.  The sauce was too thin and so did not stick to the chicken.  So you didn't get much panang flavor.  Mostly just the bland breading.  When we got home we simmered the sauce a while to reduce it, and that fixed the thickness problem.  it also appeared to have intensified the saltiness.  Which wasn't good.

The pad see ew was OK.  Not great, but OK.  My wife thought it also was too salty.

The crab puffs (part of the meals) were cold.  I mean COLD.  Whether pulled from the fridge or sitting around too long after cooking.  Either way, yuck.

The soup was a cabbage broth of some sort.  Also included with the meals.  It was OK.  No real flavor, just a broth.  It was probably the best part of the meal.

Yelp should have some mechanism to erase older ratings when management changes.  The ratings of a year ago do not apply to this new Chon Thai.  My previous review certainly no longer applies.  Kinda sad because we liked this place before."}
{"text":"Great Thai food!   I can't believe it took me so long to try it!   Service was excellent.  I am a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Chon Thai Food brings a smile to my face. Yup, that's right, I'm jumping on the Yelp bandwagon and singing the praises for this wonderful restaurant! They have an amazing lunch special, spectacular employees, stunning presentations, delicious food and ridiculously outstanding prices!! Plus, their mango and sweet sticky rice is out-of-this-world good! It is a must when you visit. All the 5 star reviews are very well deserved."}
{"text":"Omgosh this place is the BOMB!!
The employees are very nice highly recommend, the food was delicious I did take out twice they told me 15 minutes and it was usually done before then which I like yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great thai restaurant.  
I had the Chon Thai chicken rolls!  Their signature sauce was amazing!  So fresh!
I also had something simple.  Sweet n Sour Shrimp.  Very tasty and fresh!

The owner even brought it out to me looking so proud.  And he should be it was excellent and well presented!

Thanks!  I'll be back"}
{"text":"The reviews are all correct, this place is great! 

Adequate portions, great prices, very fresh and flavorful food. My wife had the Red Chicken Curry. She's not a hot pepper fanatic like me, so she went with their medium \"2\". I went with hot \"3\". I think mine was spot on and even my wife thought she'd go for \"3\" next time.

I had the Pumpkin Chicken Curry, also tremendous.

We weren't fans of the Chon Thai Rolls. We like the lighter veggie filling of spring rolls.

Overall, very nice and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"17 Jan 16 - Since the original review, my wife & I ate at this restaurant several times.  Each time, we tried one different dish on the menu.  We enjoyed each meal.  The food was always good, flavorful & fresh.

Today, we invited two of our dear friends.  They too were impressed by the flavor and freshness of all dishes we ordered.  Sorry, no picture today. 

25 Mar 16 - Great dinner tonight, yet the total bill was reasonable. Good value. 

16 July 16 - A sign on the door warned customers of recent price adjustments. I think such warning spoke nicely of the owner. 

Tonight's dinner was very tasty and enjoyable as usual. 

This restaurant continues to earn our recommendations."}
{"text":"I finally made it there, after several month of trying to get to it.  The atmosphere is very nice.  The place is extremely clean, as well.  I got a takeout order, so I did not stay.
The order process was great, as a very friendly gentleman took my order over the phone and confirmed everything.
Typically I always try a couple dishes at a \"new to me\" Thai restaurant - Pad Thai, Yellow Curry and an eggplant dish of some sort.  I will allow a little wiggle room on the eggplant dish, but any Thai place should nail the other two dishes.
This time out, I grabbed a to-go order of Pad Thai for lunch and Yellow Curry for dinner, both with chicken and both hot.
The Pad Thai was excellent - up there with best I've had, and the spice level was what I expected.  The noodles were great, the veggies fresh, and the presentation, even in the takeout box, was great.
The Yellow Curry was excellent, as well.  It probably had more potatoes than the typical place, but the carrots were hand sliced, and the onions were very fresh.  To top it off, it was served with enough rice - something other places miss - and the spice level was perfect.
I will definitely be back, and I will be trying a couple eggplant dishes and the pineapple shrimp curry, as I saw that dish being served and it smelled awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here with husband and another couple for a couples night out. The interior is chic and modern. The staff is extremely attentive and friendly. The food was delicious, we all ordered the same dish with different variations. We ordered the basal fried rice and it was delicious! Will definitely come back again to try the rest of the menu, looking forward to it! Btw, the owner is awesome!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 5 times and it's really good Thai food at good prices. It's not a 5 star restaurant but great for the price and the decor is not bad at all. Customer service always friendly. I recommend the crispy garlic chicken."}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy garlic chicken and the drunken noodle and medium spice. I also ordered a side of Thai tea which was very sweet and everything I was looking for. I will say that the medium spice is much hotter than other places which I definitely appreciate. The noodles were cooked nicely and looked visually stunning. The chicken was nice and crispy and was packed with flavor. Overall, the meal was delicious and I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food is so yummy and the prices are reasonable! This is a family owned restaurt so they are all about customer service,  place was very clea  service was great! Definitely give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"One Of The Greatest Thai Restaurants Around! 

I have spent time in Thailand so I have a bit of experience with the food. This is real Thai delicious food! Authentic and absolutely delicious describes the Feeding going on here. 

Great service and great prices on great food!

The staff is from Thailand and is always super friendly and accommodating. 

The original manager Pataya was a super friendly guy who went out of his way to make you feel welcomed and make sure everything is great. I cannot recall a manager ever making so much honest effort towards ensuring you are happy! He has since moved on to new things but the service is still good. 

We ordered the pad si ew with chicken at Thai spicy hotness! It was excellent and at $5.99 for a lunch special you can eat here every day...

We also ordered red curry at Thai spicy! It was also excellent and fresh. $5.99 lunch special also!

We have also had the Chicken Pad Thai and it is really good too with a sticky noodle!

The Thai tea was full of yummy flavor with my coconut milk substitute for dairy. 

The mango sticky rice is definitely a happy dessert here...

This place is a favorite!"}
{"text":"We chose Chon Thai as our first Thai food experience! It was wonderful, the service was quick and friendly and the food was amazing! The prices can't be beat. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Prices were very reasonable, but the portion size was pretty small (you get what you pay for).  Not much chicken in my dish.  The staff were very friendly.  Food quality was OK, nothing special."}
{"text":"The food is getting worse each time I go to this restaurant. 
What happens to their great chief?"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the staff was friendly and they made feel welcome.  Try them out!"}
{"text":"This was delicious. The prices are reasonable. The service is excellent. This is my favorite Thai spot in Chandler so far."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in chandler!
Absolutely amazing and spicy! The only downside to this place is that you would have to wait a little longer for the service! Otherwise it is the best, very close to authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. Great food. Best in town!
I have been here over 2 years and they always deliver. Sometimes food ain't the same taste but if you let them know, they will fix the problem."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Thai spot in the east valley. Consistently delicious every time I come. I've been here with large parties, small groups, they always are very friendly and have great customer service. The Thai tea is delicious. I'm a vegetarian so my go to meal always includes tofu. This time I ordered drunken noodles with tofu and my husband ordered the crispy garlic chicken. We both enjoyed it a lot. Yum. Can't wait to go back again when we're in this side of town."}
{"text":"The service definitely improved and you can't beat the price for good food. Restaurant is clean and the decor is simple but nice. I've came here a few times and the food has always been good. I've tried the chicken Thai egg rolls which are light and crispy. The chicken has a hint of curry mixed in with the potatoes. The Pad See Ew is always one of my favorites and I love that it comes  with broccoli. ( some places don't serve it with broccoli and some will charge extra to add it in). The crispy garlic chicken had good flavor but it was to crispy that it was hard to eat. I didn't enjoy that dish very much. On my most recent visit I ordered the crispy Panang chicken and yummy! The chicken wasn't over cooked & it had a light batter on the chicken. The dish came out with steamed vegetables and sauce on the side. I love spicy so I asked for the Thai hot which is their highest level of spicy, but to me it wasn't hot at all."}
{"text":"I rated them 5 stars because it is the most authentic thai restaurant that i ever had before in Arizona especially, Pad-Thai. The noodle and the spices was super delicious. Their decoration looks elegant than another  places too which i really like it."}
{"text":"Food was so good and spicy just how I like it.  I started with a Thai tea.  We shared the drunken beef noodles, yellow curry & spicy beef fried rice    All the dishes were fantastic!  I found a winner in my new neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This was mine and my wife's first time trying Thai food. It was fantastic. We had pad Thai and garlic chicken. Both dishes were delicious. The service was too notch. We will definitely be back. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the red curry chicken and ordered a mild level for spice. It was delicious! 
Recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Do yourself a favor and start with some Tom Kha coconut soup; it is to die for. 
I ordered my Drunken Noodles as Thai hot and it was spicy, but still held onto its delicious flavor without tasting only of peppers."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food restaurant I have ever been to. 

The service and the food were both beyond my expectations. I can't begin to describe how nice the staff were and how delicious every bite of food was.  It really made my birthday awesome and I plan on making this my only Thai food place from now! 

See earlier review from Mrs. B. - it was my birthday dinner! :) Hi Mum!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai Restaurant! Great food and awesome service!! The dinner portions are smaller than other Thai restaurants but the prices are cheaper as well.  For my party of two, we ordered the Chon Thai egg noodles, Penang Curry, Beef salad, Chicken egg roll, and the mango sweet rice and everything was so good!  We didn't have any leftovers! I also love that they have a heat level above \"Thai hot\"...super hot is my fav!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food experience. Restaurant is open and spacious. Food is served quickly. If you are sensitive to Spice make sure to ask for NO SPICE as everything is geared toward the spicy side."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say service is perfect, and the food is delicious. Best Thai place I've been to since I moved here thank you"}
{"text":"Came in today to check out this place and Wow! Atmosphere was very inviting and music was great! Our server was outstanding, he was super attentive, funny and polite. We started off with their calamari and spring rolls, calamari batter was super flaky and crispy but not heavy, just like I like it, I thought the pickled veggies and orange on the plate added some nice color to it, their dipping sauce could have been a tad bit spicier, it was a bit bland since the calamari batter didn't seem to be seasoned either. Spring rolls seemed pretty fresh, possibly house made? They were   yummy! For our main course, we both got Pad Thai, one was Seafood pad thai and the other was Chicken and shrimp then we also got their Chon Thai Seafood Special to go.
Both pad thai were delicious, only thing that caught me off gaurd was they use thinner noodles than what I'm use to, but it doesn't really matter or make a difference when it's so delicious, and portion size was perfect! Then when I got home I tried a bite of the special which was Thai hot level, and as much of a wimp I am I didn't find it too spicy, but I'm sure if I kept eating I would have been sweating and crying. lol. The yellow sauce in that dish is packed with some great flavor, I'd definitely recommend it! I hope this place stays in business! LOVE SUPPORTING GREAT LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT ARE ACTUALLY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Tom Yum soup is meh! It was kind of on the sweeter side even though I asked for Thai hot. And I don't like tomatoes in my Tom Yum soup or the type of generic looking mushrooms in the soup. It looks like they just sprinkled some pepper flakes on top of my Tom Yum soup to make it hotter! The garlic chicken taste nice but it was more on the sweeter side. I had to be cautious of how I chewed because it was so sweet my sensitive tooth was aching. I won't be ordering that again! It reminds me of orange chicken but with garlic flavor instead. My Thai Bowl has really good Tom Yum soup which I recently had a few days ago. I wasn't feeling well and it definitely helped me sweat out some of the sickness. I am on the fence about coming here again. The waitresses were very kind and the restaurant looked clean well put togetheI also ordered Thai rice to go. I have not tried it yet but will be back with an update. Updating on the Thai rice...it was good and the shrimp are huge and well clean."}
{"text":"Very good. Loved the ambiance and the food is delicious and the people are super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The host/owner and the service are so warm and kind. The green curry is the best one I tried in Phoenix area and it does not taste like curry directly coming from a can. The calamari and the papaya salads were not very impressive. But my dish was the reason I gave 3 stars. I asked the most Thai style dish. But the one I got was not even a bit close to what I thought. I know Thailand is big country and the food might be different over the country. However, I just did not like the one I got at all."}
{"text":"New owners that previously were working at Thai Chili. First timer. I had the Pad Thai dish, delicious. Also tried Green Curry, also delicious. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and ambiance is very nice. The place is decorated well and has a spacious open concept to it. The staff/servers are attentive and nice. The menu has a good variety of food and the food itself is tasty."}
{"text":"Crispy garlic chicken was delicious, so was the Panang curry. We finished off the meal with some mango sticky rice. Yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here for the first time today through yelp. Upon delivery I realized they forgot my Thai tea, which is sad because honestly it's my favorite part of a Thai order. Anyway I called customer service and got a refund and shortly after I received the sweetest voicemail from Mai telling me how sorry she was and how she wanted to fix it. That alone made me a customer for life.. this was before I even tried the food. After taking a few bites I can honestly say the pumpkin curry, the Panang curry and the pad Thai are amazing! They have a returning customer for sure!"}
{"text":"I am pretty particular about Thai food. My go to Thai place is Yupha's on McClintock and Elliot. I was hesitant to try this but it had good reviews. My go to dish Is the classic pad Thai. I have to say, it was pretty good and really cheap. Service was excellent as well. There was another dish I tried that was just a complete winner. The crispy garlic chicken.  Soooo good. The texture and taste were a perfect match. So worth the time to check it out. The lunch specials seem too go to be true. $6 for lunch and really good too. Definitely worth coming back. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"The presentation of the food could be featured on a brochure. The flavor was better tasting than it looks, that's saying something. I just wish the smell of the restaurant had a pleasant aroma and not the smell of an old gymnasium."}
{"text":"The food was awesome but the knowledge of our (not Asian) server was pitiful. NOTHING was cleaned from our table. No one checked on us and I had to get up to ask for everything. Bottom line: if I ever eat there again, I'll be getting take out"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Pat the Asian guy goes over and beyond to make sure your happy and his personality is just a happy kind person.  The food is delicious and affordable. Can't go wrong with this place.  Love them"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food is the service. After I got my Coke, she came to take my order. After she took my order, she asked if I wanted more Coke. It was half full. It never got less than half full the entire time I was there. They are knowledgeable about their menu and ready to help you make a choice. Probably easy to do when everything on the menu is delicious. I will be back probably more than a few times. Can't wait to try this entire menu."}
{"text":"This place has EXCELLENT food.  We loved the Drunken Noodles and the soup. The service was great too.  They are super friendly and it's nice inside."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great quantity and great prices. Customer service was excellent. Definitely great for a date or even just a nice lunch."}
{"text":"I'm definitely going to be a regular from now on. The food is pretty good and there's no wait for lunch time! Which is a perk since who wants to wait a long time to eat during their lunch hour on a workday? 

I ordered a red curry and my husband ordered pad see eew. Definitely worth a try! Spiciness level is based on your request so be cautious! Mine was a medium and was pretty spicy. 

I came back again and ordered their beef noodles. I definitely do not recommend that dish...I didn't like it very much. 

For dessert, try their mango spicy rice! Mango was fresh (not canned like some places) and it was served the perfect sweetness."}
{"text":"This place is new, so they're still in their honeymoon period. It will be interesting to see where they are in 4 years. I can only review them in what I experienced today though, and they earned all 5 stars with aplomb. 

I enjoyed the green curry and satay skewers for lunch. They were delicious. The curry was the perfect portion and only $5.99. The skewers were made from thigh meat not breast which is a big plus in my book. I do not like breast meat. 

I ordered a Thai Coffee. It was so good that I ordered another right after it. And at only $2.00, I may have had three if I wasn't so full. 

Well Done."}
{"text":"I've been back two times since my initial review and my Pad See Ew was AMAZING both times! Not dry, perfectly cooked broccoli, perfect amount of heat.  I find myself craving it now.  I got the lunch special the other day and it's only $5.99!  Even the dinner portion is only $7.99.  Amazing prices for the quality of food.  Service amazing as always.  Even got the BF to try it despite them not serving beer, and he loved it as well.  Everyone is so nice there and they take a lot of pride in their restaurant.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. 
- great service
- delicious food with beautiful plate presentation 
- nice modern decor
- really clean 

I can see why the other reviews were 5 stars."}
{"text":"One star for the below average food during lunch break.

Zero stars for.... CHARGING CUSTOMERS FOR DEBIT CARD USAGE?

\"Due to the rising prices of credit card processing fees we have just recently charged 3.5% to card transactions of the total bill but offer 5% off for cash transactions so customers do have options.\"\"

Ate lunch the day before but never again. The next week my family wanted Thai so I took my $70 for dinner elsewhere that evening.

Why lose the business, like myself over a small fee?

Don't eat here. Just a tid bit to the new ownership-if you are concerned about credit card processing fees, just build the pricing into the actual menu. Pretty difficult concept?"}
{"text":"I've been around the block - when it comes to Thai food...and this place is amazing! And you have to try the Panang Salmon Curry. Excellent customer service also Bonus: the restaurant has a similar vibe to a yoga studio, ommmmmm"}
{"text":"Excellent business! Staff is super friendly and we didn't wait long for service or top-offs. Food was on point! Restaurant was clean and pricing seamed reasonable. I'm not a big fan of Thai food but my girl is so we eat it a lot. I actually look forward to going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Me: Soooo, ... yummmm!

Craig: *laughing* Amen to that. 

Me: That crispy garlic chicken is as amazing as all those other reviewers said it was. Nicely done, yelpers!

Craig: It was amaze-balls. 

Me: Also the pad see ew with chicken was really flavorful. I loved it. 

Craig: It was an excellent pad see ew. The only letdown for me was the pineapple fried rice. Yelpers let us down on that one. Still, two out of three ain't bad. 

Me: Yeah, that one was kind of meh for me, too. But the service was phenomenal. 

Craig: I liked how each dish came out as soon as it was ready, so it was really hot and fresh. 

Me: Yeah, that worked great for us since we were dining family style. Not sure it would work so well if everyone ordered their own dish, but maybe they only did that because we told them we were doing family style when we ordered. But regardless, all the food came out really quickly. 

Craig: Another good thing, my glass never got halfway down before they refilled it. 

Me: Yeah, they were very attentive but not oppressively so. I liked the restaurant overall. It was nice and open, with soothing background music. A pleasant experience. 

Craig: I can't get this bag open. 

Me: *laughing* Here. We did have a lot left over. Two dishes would be more than enough for two people. Maybe even three people. 

Craig: Are you gonna put in the--?

Me: Yeah. The non-cash fee is ridiculous. Who charges for using a credit card in this day and age? 

Craig: Especially without saying something first. 

Me: And $1.50? Rubbish. But otherwise, I love this place. I would totally come back. But I'd pay with cash next time. Any final thoughts?

Craig: Nope. Don't forget the pictures. 

Me: I'm on it."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten in in a long time. The waiters/waitresses were SUPER kind and attentive. We grabbed the pad thai, drunken noodles, and Chon Thai rolls. The pad thai was delicious and cooked just right. The drunken noodles had a good amount of \"wok\" flavor and lastly the Chon thai rolls were very tasty. The rolls themselves were unique to Chon Thai. I haven't had that combination of chicken and what I believe was potato in a crispy roll before. 

We also had the pleasure of trying that sticky rice and custard combination. It was wonderfully sticky sweet and salty. The best part was it came out nice and hot (just the way the dessert should be).

Overall, it was a excellent experience and will definitely be returning. If you're looking for a great new place to try look no further than Chon Thai."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite here: Tom Kha soup! It was so delicious! I actually ordered the Green curry for myself and the Tom Kha soup for my sister at home because she had strep and needed something to soothe her throat. I'm glad I did because I tasted it and instantly fell in love with it!!"}
{"text":"The Dom Kha was delicious, the mangos and sticky rice just like I remember it from Thailand. Reasonably priced, too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"It is very good Thai restaurant, lovely atmosphere and service. 
We quite like the Thai tea, definitely will order again next time.  
The portion of all food is great."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! My boyfriend finished his plate and mine lol So happy to have superb Thai Food so close by, I will be coming back soon :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place that can compare to the best green curry I've had and Chon's had great reviews so I had to give it a try. I called in my order and expected to just pick it up and go on my way but the owner was so polite, even asked my name and introduced herself, which was very very nice. From the phone customer service to the quick interaction - 5 stars on service. Now the green curry.... SCORE! It was delicious and I will definitely be a regular customer from now on."}
{"text":"So delicious and fresh!! We are suckers for Pad See Ew with chicken...it's hard for us to stray. We've had red and yellow curries in the past and both were so good.  We've also had the Tom Yum soup which is so flavorful and the serving for two is great to share as an appetizer. 
The place is clean and the staff is super friendly!! Prices are great too! 

You won't be disappointed with Chon Thai!"}
{"text":"Service is fantastic .  Inside is nice (tables, tvs , etc ).. however ... wait for it ... drunken noodles beef did not taste right like old and not flavored .  The portions are small for the cost.   The red chicken curry literally had 4 bites of chicken in small bowl and the 9$ doesn't include rice.   Great service . But either over priced or small portions you pick."}
{"text":"Very good experience! The people are So friendly and want to please.. Fun place and great food."}
{"text":"Food was very good and great portion size. The guy who took my order over the phone and gave it to us when we got there was super friendly and nice. He was so helpful in the phone and met all our needs in person as well. Would return again."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously delicious!!!  We used to frequent another hot spot in the valley for thai food, but we will for sure be coming here from now on. I went in and ordered the chicken satay and crab delights as appetizers. They were both delicious. The chicken satay came in skewers wth a side of peanut sauce which was SO good. 

Our entrees included chicken panang curry and the chicken pad thai. We loved the panang curry. We ordered ours medium and it was quite hot for us but we enjoyed it! Our kids had the kids chicken fried rice. We tried theirs and it was great and the portion sizes were perfect for them. They loved it. 

I ordered to-go as a walk-in customer and the gentleman up front was SUPER nice and helpful. He directed me to the entrees that were the most popular. He also offered me a 10% discount as a first time guest. 

When I waited for my order, they kindly brought over some ice water for me and it was so nice for them to do that. Not many places do that nowadays, so that was a really sweet gesture. 

We tried going there again today because the food was THAT good, but they were closed today. Such a bummer and I may need to tell them to stay open 7 days a week from now on. 

Great food. We'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Picked up take-out from Chon Thai on Sunday night and it was delicious. My boyfriend got the Pad Thai ($10) & I got the Chicken and Veggies ($11) dish. Both were large (enough for two meals) and SO good!! We also got the spring rolls ($6) and they were delicious. The prices were a little bit more than some of the Thai places around us, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"We have a new favorite Thai place in town! The struggle to find Vegan Thai food is real. So many places say they can make items vegan, and then end up tasting fishy or bland. Chon has a dedicated vegan menu and can make all curries vegan. 

We started with the vegan spring rolls. They we okay but nothing special. For entrees we had the Thai basil with tofu (mild) and the panang curry with tofu (medium hot). They were both perfect. The tofu was prepared well - lightly fried and firm. Every bite of the basil dish offered a mouthful of flavor without being too spicy. The panang had notes of sweetness balanced with just enough heat to make it fun but not so much that I couldn't enjoy it. The veggies in both were fresh and crisp - not over cooked.

I got a free Thai iced tea from checking in, which was made vegan with coconut milk. We also tried the special vegan dessert of McMahon's coconut ice cream. The iced tea was a little too sweet for me but still good. The ice cream had a nice fresh flavor and I doubt anyone would have guessed that it was vegan. 

The service was prompt and pleasant - no issues at all. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant, for so many reasons! First: the staff here is SO friendly. From the moment you call for a take out/delivery order or enter to dine in, you feel so appreciated as a customer. Then, the food seals the deal. It's so flavorful, they get the spice level right, portions are large, and the presentation is very impressive! The prices are very reasonable as well. Overall, there is not one bad or even slightly negative thing I could write about this place. It is the best Thai place I've ever eaten at, by far!

Personally, I love the red curry, pad thai, drunken beef noodle and the calamari appetizer, but I have no doubt that everything on the menu is probably amazing. Chon Thai has a life-long customer in me."}
{"text":"The taste is different past few times we visited.the taste is not very flavorful anymore. 
All the dishes taste very different now and not a very good Thai place anymore. 
Hope they improve and get back the the taste of food."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great flavors, beautiful presentation, reasonable prices, clean, wonderful service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai and pad see ew for pick up. My husband and I were so disappointed. The pad Thai barely had any sauce. It was so dry and hardly had any flavor to it. The chicken also tasted old. The pad see ew was better, flavor-wise but same thing with the meat, it tasted stale as well.

To be fair, we did place the order 30 minutes before closing so maybe that's why the dishes were made poorly. And if that was the case, why even take the order in the first place?"}
{"text":"I went with my friend and we waited for 45 minutes. I was not happy with the waiting time but server was nice! 
To be honest, I did not trust yelp review when I saw it has more than 100 reviews with 5 stars. Therefore, I decided to try this place. We ordered 3 dishes and it was all good even Thai Tea. Also, I didn't try their lunch special but seems they have very nice price range and good foods. I would definitely go back and try!

FYI: compare to other Thai places, portion is smaller than other places. However, the price is cheaper!"}
{"text":"I went there couple times and it as been always great!
The decorations inside to the service and the quality of the food it's a 5. The way they care about the presentation of there plates and all the details, it's just great! I recommend this place to everyone who wants to try some good Thai food!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, like any other Thai food place.  Actually I did not remember how it tastes, not too good and not too bad, not special.  However I do remember the no cash fee and was not happy about it.  For the record to the management, I didn't bring it up to them at that time, but that didn't mean I enjoy paying the no cash fee.  Just like when they asked me how was the food and I said good even thought I think otherwise.  I didn't want to spend the time to point it what is not good and ruined my dinning experience.  I felt the needed to make this clear because I saw in some reviews that people gave their opinion about the food and the management replied by saying \"well, we asked you how was the food and you said good\". Oh boy.  And I didn't see the notice on the front door about the no cash fee even though according to the management it has been there for over a year.  I think the way the management runs the resturant is   dishonest and they don't seem to care about their customers."}
{"text":"This place is great. First time here and was not sure what to expect. They have a variety of items. Papaya Salad, Pork dish and Garlic Fried Chicken were very good. We selected \"Hot\" which did burn a little, but overall was good dining in a pleasant location and reasonable prices. Coming back for more one of these days."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai food. We had Mussaman Curry and eggplant shrimp. Excellent!
The ambience is fresh and semi modern with very friendly staff.
Try it!"}
{"text":"I feel like we are eating Thai food every single day! This time we tried a place near our home, I have been meaning to try it for quite a while now actually. 
The lunch menu is really nice and not expensive at all (around $5.99 a plate, served with either a soup or a salad) We had a chicken dish and the drunken beef noodles (really tasty). I had a Thai Iced Tea that was delicious.
The reason why I am only giving 4 stars is because of the service, it can be quite slow. But overall, it is a very good place for lunch. Next time, I am going to try the Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations eating there based on these reviews. And this place managed to exceed our expectations. Service is wonderful! The best Thai food we ever had in Arizona. All positive reviews about this place are true."}
{"text":"The pad see ew was rather oily with a large number of broken noodle, but otherwise unremarkable.  The salad it came with, simple. The Thai iced tea was fine.  

The good part is the price; lunch special with Thai iced tea was under $12 together.  

Note that this place is so Americanized that you get Sriracha and nameless Chinese-American chili mash sauce instead of the pickled jalapeño and fish sauce with Thai chili for condiments.  Didn't see the big bottle of sugar anyway either. 

This place presents a decent value, but not the kind of Thai restaurant I'm looking for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places here in Arizona! You can get some really good food fot its price, with some super filling dishes for not more than 11 or 12 dollars (5% off with cash). The food is always fresh and is never haphazardly thrown together unlike other thai restaurants. My favorites are the red curry and the basil rice dish. Go here if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Love Chon Thai. The owner May is so sweet and the staff is so friendly! Our favorite Thai restaurant in the valley!!"}
{"text":"They were very nice, fast service! I love their pad thai and fried rice!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Our waiter Pat was exuberant, respectful, and nice. The food was delicious and came out quick and hot. The curry was spicy at the \"hot\" level. I'd work my way up and not just jump right into the hottest level. Id recommend trying the satay and red curry. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, they offer Gluten Free options and take care when preparing food. Great service, always clean and the staff is so polite and kind.  Lunch menu with soup and salad is the perfect size.   The food is even good next day as leftovers."}
{"text":"This was the best Thai we've had in a long time. It is so reasonable too. We had Crispy Panang chicken, yellow curry, pad gratium pix tai beef and  Fried bananas. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We ate here 10/7/16. Great service, very quick to greet and seat you. The price and serving sizes are great! I love spicy food and got the Chon Thai egg noodles. It was very spicy for a level 3. Next time I will go with a 2! I didn't like the Chon Thai egg noodle dish it was very dry and bland. My fiancé got the pineapple chicken curry and it was amazing. Overall great experience looking forward to going back and trying something different!

The setting was rather bright, not very intimate. It appeared to be a very clean place though. The chairs.. I don't mean to complain but for someone with a bad back who is 5'5\" it was a long dinner date sitting in those chairs where my feet couldn't reach the floor and zero padding. I was definitely in and out quickly! The setting fits the price point, for sure!"}
{"text":"My friends recommended this place saying their food is awesome!! I decided to give it a try and I am sooo glad I did!! This is one of the best Thai food I have ever had. AND absolutely nobody from any restaurant from any place can beat their service. Nicest people working there. Wow! They waved and greated us with a smile and thanked us for coming when we were leaving and waved goodbye as he held the door for us. Like you would when guests come to your home.  Delicious food, authentic, and great atmosphere at a very good price! I would give this place 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"We love Chon Thai. Great atmosphere, very courteous and attentive staff. Food is always high quality & Delicious. Great prices!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai restaurant in the city. Food is always delicious, generous,  and priced well comparatively. Staff are all so nice and polite. Inside is nice, clean, and modern. Good for a date night, or family meal. This place should really be much busier."}
{"text":"My mom ordered catered Som Tum, Yum Nua, Pad Thai and Vegetarian Pad Thai from here.  The food was fantastic.  The staff was so friendly.  I am normally not a huge fan of Pad Thai, but theirs is amazing, not overly sweet and noodles cooked to perfection.  Som Tum had a nice spicy kick and super delicious.  Everyone loved the food."}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant and it is wonderful. Definitely some of the best Thai food in the valley. I can't recommend them more. We had the yum nua (fresh beef salad), tom kha (amazing pseudo-soup), pineapple shrimp curry, green curry, pad gra pow (stir fry), and pad thai (made with fresh noodles!). Truly an amazing meal. Also, the prizes are stunningly low. We'll be coming back, no doubt."}
{"text":"Prologue:
My girlfriend and I decided to dine out on Christmas Eve and we were in the mood for something different than the traditional holiday fare.
It had been awhile since we last dined out for Thai cuisine, so after reading several good reviews on Yelp, we decided to give this place a try.

The Plot:
We started by sharing an order of Papaya Salad, followed by the Pad Gratium Pik Tai Beef and the Pla Lui Soun.

The Scene:
The portion sizes were good and, for the most part, were plenty for the two of us.

We ordered the Papaya Salad *hot* (mid-range on their spicy scale), which was on the verge of being unbearable for me and just what I wanted. There was plenty of papaya with the standard assortment of veggies, etc., and enough sauce to cause a nice after-burn in my mouth.

We ordered the Pla Lui Soun *medium*, which featured a nice balance of the familiar combination of spicy and sweet flavors that is the hallmark of Thai cuisine. The texture of the julienned mango was just right, not too soft or crunchy, and well complimented the texture of the fish.

We also ordered the Pad Gratium Pik Tai Beef *medium*, which was the star of the meal. The beef was tender, flavorful, with just the right amount of spice, and it went together very well with the white rice.

The Rest of the Story:
The first thing we noticed was the ubiquitous presence of locally grown produce and the virtual absence of any Asian vegetables. For example, all of the dishes included carrots and chopped iceberg lettuce, the Papaya Salad included string beans that were not Asian, and the Pad Gratium Pik Tai Beef included broccoli and zucchini.

My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, remarked that there was not much to distinguish the majority of the ingredients in the entrees from Chinese cuisine and I had to agree that what we were served was not distinctly Thai based on my own previous dining experiences.

I'm fairly certain that the fish fillet in the Pla Lui Soun came out of the freezer, it wasn't crispy, and it was buried inside of a mound of julienned mango so that the dish was more like a mango salad with fish rather than the other way around.

I like Thai sticky rice very much, however the rice we were served with our meal was steamed like the kind you usually get with Chinese food.

Epilogue:
The service was prompt and courteous and the prices were on par for this type of restaurant.
Although the food was reasonably good, it did not live up to our expectations for authentic Thai cuisine.
We were also somewhat disappointed that the mango with sticky rice was unavailable for dessert that evening.

{"text":"The food is pretty decent. But its more of a fusion place than authentically all Thai food."}
{"text":"I feel like I really need to update my review because the food & service here is just so good.
No, they still don't have my favorite fresh rolls, but truly everything here is simply exceptional. 
If you love Thia food, and are budget conscious - but not willing to compromise the quality of your eating, you should absolutely come to this family run, top quality, truly Thia restaurant.
If nothing else they are all just so kind you will leave feeling loved & apriciated. And who couldn't use more of that in their life?"}
{"text":"We received a recommendation today to get some delicious Thai food and Chon delivered! The Crispy Garlic Chicken was fantastic! The service was excellent as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had the pad Thai, pad-se-eww, pineapple fried rice and a few of their curry dishes. Everything was soooo good! I asked for one of the dishes \"Thai hot\" and was not disappointed with the level of spiciness. The service was very friendly and welcoming and the place has nice decor. I'm not from the area but will definitely eat there again when I visit my family."}
{"text":"Service was incredible! Walked into a restaurant full of smiles. Everyone was extremely friendly and the service was very fast. 

The lunch special prices are very cheap! And the food portion is very reasonable. 

Price + portion + taste ="}
{"text":"This place is excellent, the staff are amazing as well as the food. The red curry they offer is one of the best in the valley."}
{"text":"I ordered To-Go: Spring roll, Papaya salad,Tom Kha soup, Pad gra pow, Pumpkin curry, and Drunken noodle. All in medium (bit spicy for me) but they ALL were on point. I have had many Thai food but this restaurant is on my #1 as of yesterday. The price is very reasonable for dinner. It was for three adults and left me plenty of leftover."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a couple of times now and it's always been enjoyable! Our first trip we tried the Pumpkin Curry Dish which was fantastic! This round we tried the Yellow Curry along with the mango sticky rice, both were amazing.

The staff is always very friendly, make sure that we're taken care of, and overall seem happy to be there. Definitely a five star and we will continue to come for their great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Really good pad Thai! Bring cash or they charge you $1 service fee without telling you."}
{"text":"Returned to Chon Thai after having a craving for delicious Thai food for several days. Just like the first time here, the food and service did not disappoint. 

Ordered the Drunken Beef Noodles and Chicken Chon Thai roll again (they were too tasty the first time to pass up). It's wonderful to see that the food is very consistent.

We also ordered the Chicken Satay and all I can say is WOW. The seasoning on this perfectly cooked chicken with peanut sauce on the side is simply great. I didn't think an appetizer at Chon Thai could top the Chicken Chon Thai Roll but the Chicken Satay is easily it's equal, I'd recommend ordering both.

For a second entrée item we tried the Pad See Ew with chicken. While the basic ingredients are nearly identical to the Drunken Beef Noodles, the seasoning really makes it stand apart as a separate and distinct dish, easily as good as the Drunken Beef Noodles. I describe it tasting as if delicious Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles had a subtly sweet and savory lovechild.

There is also a new coconut and gelatin based dessert that is soon to be on the menu that, whom I suspect is the owner, allowed us to try. I really hope this item makes it on to the menu as it was the perfect light and slightly sweet ending to our dinner. It has a similar flavor to a good rice pudding but was made, as far as I can tell, entirely out of a flavored but nearly clear gelatin with coconut meat and a small topping of whipped cream. Try this dessert if it's available.

Just like my first glowing review of Chon Thai recommends, do yourself a favor and head over for some fresh and delicious Thai food. The pricing at Chon Thai with the level of quality they offer is nearly unheard of in the entire Phoenix Metro Area. They have very inexpensive lunch specials and a deal for 10% off dinner. 

I really hope the crew at Chon Thai are here to stay for a long, long time. I know I can't wait to return, I've got my eye on that Garlic Crispy Chicken on the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the green curry chicken and it was lacking in flavor. There's definitely better Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"$5.99 lunch specials! With such a great deal and with numerous 5 star reviews, we knew we had to check this restaurant out for lunch. The interior is relaxing and elegant with a nicely laid out space.

There are several lunch specials to choose from and they include a piece of crab rangoon and your choice of soup or salad. The soup for the day was a vegetable soup, which I chose with my red curry chicken, Thai hot. Preparing in advance for the spicy feast to come, I also ordered a Thai iced tea ($2).

The Thai iced tea had a lovely ombre transition from creamy white to rich auburn. It was almost too pretty to mix up to even out the cream and tea (Almost). It was served in a tower-like tall glass. It was an excellent compliment to the bold, spicy flavor of the red curry, which had a hearty amount of meat and a variety of nicely cooked vegetables. As Thai hot, it was actually the penultimate level of spiciness, as the \"super hot\" was the one spicy level to rule them all. They definitely delivered on the spice end, and I thought the heat level was appropriate for Thai hot. As for the crab rangoon and the soup, they were pretty plain and served more as filler for the meal. 

Service was excellent and the young gentleman here especially did an admirable job making sure everyone was satisfied with their meals.

So, exceptional service, great prices, and a lovely atmosphere. How can you go wrong? :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend just took me here for dinner and it was so amazing! Great ambiance, great service, and the food was top notch. Get the Thai Tea, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and so was the food! We arrived 1 minute before they were supposed to be closing until dinner. We hadn't realized that they closed and then re-opened. Otherwise we wouldn't have shown up (we aren't THAT big of jerks :) ) But the nice woman waitress let us in and gave us superb service just as if we hadn't come in before closing (you know how some restaurants treat you around closing time) Reasonably priced, delicious food, and wonderful service. I would totally recommend them! Just note. They close from 3-5 on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Um....YUM!!! Can I give this place more than 5 stars?? The service was awesome. They care that you love your food. We had the spring rolls, chicken pad Thai and the pad gra prow chicken. All were amazing. So much flavor, but everything tasted clean. Cute little place with huge flavor. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Under new management. Prices have gone up and the quality of the food has gone down. I'm very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food, if you like spicy you have to go extra hot.  Their hot is pretty mild. Their red curry sauce is very good!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful treat having dinner here for Mother's Day! The crispy garlic chicken was amazing along with a delicious Thai tea. My son had the vegan pad Thai that was also delicious. Great place! Will definitely return. Thank you for the Rose for Mother's Day."}
{"text":"Tried Special menu: pumpkin curry. It is pricier than normal curry but portion is bigger! 

They cooked pumpkin perfectly, not overcooked. Not too sweet and has a good spicy. 

I will come back for this!"}
{"text":"We've been here about 5 times or so now, mostly to dine in and one occurrence of take out. 
In a nutshell: this place fricken rocks. 
There is probably the nicest gentleman on the planet here. I think he's the owner. Anyway, I want to be friends with this guy...he's attentive, kind, and very, very appreciative. 

I've had their chicken Pad Thai multiple times. It's light but full of flavor with moist chicken and a balance of flavors. They give you a nicely sized lime for zing, plenty of meat, peanuts, and thinly sliced fresh veggies to mix in with your piping hot noodles that are thinner than you might expect but oh so delicious. 

Tonight, I had their Drunken Beef Noodle. Oh. My. Gosh. I don't know that I've ever had such a deliciously flavored beef dish that was so flavorful but not at all heavy. Crisp bell peppers, beautifully sautéed onions, tender strips of beef perfectly cooked. Holy cow. Seriously. 

In a nutshell of the previous nutshell, eat here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here primarily because of the reviews. I guess people don't really know what tasty Thai is like. I ordered the massaman curry. They served a good portion, but very bland. Every time we asked for something that has always been included in our Thai meals, such as salad, it was an extra charge. Okay food, but not even close to some of the rave reviews given by others. Meh."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great staff and delicious food! Finally a great Thai place in Chandler area. Would love to come back here soon."}
{"text":"The best Thai food around! Service is amazing! The food was amazing also! Don't miss out on this terrific place!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant through a fellow Instagramer, looked it up on Yelp and here we are today having lunch. I called at 11:00 a.m. to make a reservation for lunch at 12:15 and I was told we did not need one at that time. We got to the restaurant at 12:15 p.m. all the tables were filled and we were told we had to wait, so we did 20 minutes later we had a table. Atmosphere was nice and fresh. I would like owners to take note on getting more diners in and out faster, having all 4 seat tables might look nice in the open setting but is not practically on a dining standpoint of single or double dinners especially for lunch, when you have 1 diner taking up a table for 4., the restaurant should really think about having a lot more table for 2 and then pushing together if needed for 4 or more parties.

So beside my annoyance of waiting, I thought the servers were great, very polite very apologetic. We ordered from the dinner menu to share as I took note the lunch Specials portions would not be enough for my dining partner. We started with the Small Tom Kha Chcken \"Thai Hot\" which was excellent. Filled with a lot of chicken, more chicken than mushrooms which I loved. Next was the Chon Thai Chicken Rolls, also nice delicately flavored and light. Entrees, we ordered the Pad Thai Chicken \"Super Hot\" and the Red Curry Chicken \"Thai Hot\". Both Entrees very good. I did notice the Pad Thai uses the thin rice noodles rather than the thicker one, still good though. Presentation of all food was very very nice. All the dinner prices were very reasonably priced. In addition, a liquor license would also be a nice addition as \"Thai Hot\" goes well with an Ice Cold Beer.

I will be back, when in the area again, this time with a reservation."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Came in for their lunch specials and received good customer service. Good food at a good price. I ordered the drunken noodles and it was delicious! Lunch option came with a soup/salad and also a crispy crab wonton. Only complaint would be that I ordered \"hot\" and it came out mild. I think they don't season their food too spicy, reason is because they don't want customers to take it back if it was too spicy"}
{"text":"This place is my NEW favorite Thai food restaurant. It is clean. Service is spot on. The food is made with quality ingredients and super yummy. We had the Tom Ka soup, red curry and yellow curry. Yum, yum, and yum. We will be back. All this and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Great food and great service! The staff was really friendly and polite. The decor was subtle oriental flair and unique.
 My husband and I ordered chon thai rolls (per yelp review recommendations), pad thai w/ chicken, pumpkin curry w/ chicken and mango sticky rice. We had ordered the pad thai and pumpkin curry as mild and it still had a spicy kick. Of the two entrees the pad thai was a bit better. 
Chon is also reasonably priced. I can't wait to introduce other people I know to this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant uses quality food, the prices are reasonable, atmosphere is great, service is impeccable, and the best things is it's authentic! I think I've found my new 'go to' Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had their garlic crispy chicken..... excellent!! The only thing they could have left off the dish was the dried basil....in my opinion it added nothing!!  This was my first visit, but I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"So good! The Pad Thai is the real deal and customer service on point!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Panang Beef Curry - Yes!  I've only been there once, but I will definitely put this place on my list.  I dined-in alone, and the service was very good.  I got enough attention, but not too much.  I didn't notice alcohol on the menu, so double-check that if it's something that's important to you.  

I plan to go through their entire curry menu as a personal goal."}
{"text":"Very nice experience here. The food is fantastic with very high quality ingredients. This is the best Thai restaurant I have found here in the valley!! Very attentive wait staff team. I highly recommend Chon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the yellow curry chicken and Pad Thai. The flavor of the yellow curry was good, however the food was really oily in comparison to other Thai restaurants I have tried. Their portions were also very small. The pad thai had a large portion of greens in the container with very little food. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Very fresh food great Thai flavors. The Thai beef salad and the chicken larb were great starters. The drunken noodles had just a hint of smokyness to give it that subtle extra touch to make me crave more."}
{"text":"This place is terrific.  Food was delicious and the restaurant is beautifully decorated.  Servers were friendly and worked hard to serve all the people in the restaurant.  There must have been a problem since service was slow and owner thanked us for being patient.  We were in no hurry so it wasnt a problem for us.  The food is perfectly seasoned and flavorful.  I ordered drunken noodles and it was probably the best I've ever had.  My husband ordered a green curry dish that was also excellent.  We will return."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. We had the green curry and pumpkin curry. Both were perfectly seasoned with the vegetables exactly right. The staff clearly takes great pride in their restaurant. I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious.. great service.. located in a strip mall on Alma School .. 

On my today's visit we started with the calamari .. lightly fried with a sweet house (perfectly fried), chicken chon Thai roll served with a sweet & sour sauce and an onion jalapeño sweet relish type sauce .. the rolls had chicken, potatoes & carrots hearty starter.. as our entree we split the medium heat green curry loaded up with veggies, and the chicken pad Thai (equally delicious).. 

Our cups were never empty, food came out fast, medium heat was perfect but they do offer off the charts heat if you like it like that .."}
{"text":"Place was clean and the staff inviting. We ordered calamari rings which were what you would expect nothing fancy but good . Crab puffs which were excellent and light and spring rolls. All came out in a timely manner. For Entrees my wife had Pad see ew with beef..I had the Cashew Chicken Medium with a side of plain fried rice and my mother had crispy garlic chicken. This plate was very pretty topped with fried basil and carrot flowers...All the dishes were flavorful and prepared well and good size portions. The service was excellent  and attentive. If there is a negative is that the do not have a liquid license of any kind...."}
{"text":"The food is amazing . The customer service is out of this world.  The owner takes great pride in pleasing the customer and ensuring the experience is awesome.  You must try it."}
{"text":"Had tom yum soup & basil fried rice. Flavor was on point and service was really good."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out tonight and I'm highly impressed! Ordered beef panang, red curry and basil fried rice to go. Order was ready to be picked up within 10 minutes of ordering. The man who took the order over the phone was so nice and polite. The food turned out to be amazing! I was so surprised that the beef in the panang was very tender and not over boiled like most restaurants. Both curries were spiced perfectly and tasted amazing! The vegetables in both curries were cut thick and fresh. They definitely don't skimp on veggies and the protein. The basil fried rice was amazing! We did get it at spice level 3 and it turned out to be pretty spicy ( which we like) I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while on a random bike ride along the canal from Gilbert to Chandler.  Comfortable seating,  no wait,  and clean. I ordered the green thai chicken with brown rice ($1.50 charge for brown  rice) and my husband ordered the yellow curry chicken with brown rice.  Serving size was large but it was so delicious that we managed to eat it all!! Server was happy and very nice.  I'd highly recommend this place. I love Thai food!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a weekday lunch. Great variety of lunch specials.
I opted for soup with my drunken beef noodles.the soup was brothy loaded with cabbage and onions a nice tangy spicey finish. No idea what it was called. 
The drunken beef arrived from the nuclear reactor steamy aromatic and tasty.. heavy on the egg.. basil strewn through.. the beef was tender and flavorful. I ordered \"Thai hot\" 4th on the hot chart but it could have been a bit spicier. 
I want to try more items and different soups. A lot of potential. I will return for more great service and ice cold water!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Highly recommend their specialty, Crispy Garlic Chicken. Although it's not a traditional Thai dish it is just too unique and delicious not to go back for! Also tried their Tom Yum soup, Red Curry and Thai Tea, they were all great. The staff is extremely friendly but not efficient. We had a lack of silverware, napkins and very slow refills on water. All in all the best Thai I've had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So I was invited by Jib W to come try this new Thai restaurant. It's only been open for three weeks and I love these family owned places. I was a little hesitant to come here cause my family really doesn't like spicy food and all these reviews are giving them five stars (no one gets all five stars). What the heck, just told my family we're going to this Thai restaurant tonight. 

Came here for a early Saturday dinner. Very interesting when you first walk in. Looks very clean, very new with a modern Asia flare. We were greeted when we walked in by the waiter. Smiling and thanking us for coming in. Very friendly. 

I started off with a Thai coffee and my wife had a Thai iced tea. Both were good but really sweet. Little bit too sweet to my taste but it was very good. We started off with two appetizers the Chicken Chon Thai rolls and the Sweet & Sour Wings. I was going to order the spring rolls but our waiter said the Chon rolls are special. Can't get this anywhere else. It came with three rolls sliced in half. So the rolls were ok. Couldn't tell what was in the rolls but putting the sauces on the rolls was good. Nice and crispy. The sweet & sour wings were a little spicy and good. Liked the sauce on the wings. Little sweet yet spicy. Really liked it. 

I had the Crispy Garlic Chicken with a side of sticky rice. Huge portion of chicken. Fried with this garlic sauce and asked for medium heat. It's was really good with dried basil leafs. Enjoyed it. Crispy but not dry inside. Moist. Really likes the sauce but couldn't really taste the heat. 

My daughter got her favorite Drunken Beef Noodles. I got a taste and it was really good. Loved the beef and the noodles. Unfortunately my daughter finished off her dish and she really liked it. 
My wife got the Chon Thai Seafood Special. It had shrimp, scallops, calamari and other stuff with no heat. Thought it was really good. It came with a side of rice too. Seafood was cooked really good with nice spices and really good portions. 

So for dessert, we got fried banana ice cream. It had a nice portions of fried bananas with ice cream in the middle with whip cream. Really good. The fried banana had a little taste of coconut. We could barely finish it but It was so good. 

So the service was outstanding. Our service was the tall Asian man who I found out is the cousin of the cooks. The cooks is a mom and pop show. So he was really good. Very thoughtful. Always thanking us. Filling out water glasses and pulling the dirty dishes. 

So we had a really good time tonight. Good Thai food, excellent service, and a nice friendly ambiance. What else could you ask for. Oh yea, prices were reasonable too. Enjoy. We sure did."}
{"text":"For months I thought Thai Basil on Rural had the best curry. I was wrong. So wrong. 
The pumpkin curry here is a slice of heaven. Seriously. It's amazing. So flavorful. Whatever youre used to ordering at other places... Order less spicy... They make it HOT here. 
I will DEFINITELY be back for that pumpkin curry... Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely lucky that Chon Thai is right around the corner from my house!  Their food is very consistent, the prices are fair, the service is always spot on whenever I dine in and the owner is always welcoming and friendly.  I've tried an assortment of curries (all  of them very tasty), a few standard noodle dishes like pad see ew and phad thai (they always come with lots of yummy veggies and the portions are great) and I start every meal with either Tom Yum or Tom Kha-very flavorful with loads of mushrooms and goodies!  Whether you're dining in or taking out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Thai food this good in a long time! I ordered the Thai fried rice and added shrimp to it. There was a huge portion and so much flavor. Keep in mind that this restaurant does not serve alcohol. You can bring your own alcohol which is a nice thing and definitely keeps the bill cheaper! :-) The inside is beautifully decorated as well. I recommend you give this place a try!  The owner is just so friendly and makes you feel welcome. Give this place a shot you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"When I think of Thai I can't think of nothing but the green curry, it has been my favorite Thai dish forever. For the first time my husband and I tried two new dishes and we were super satisfied with both the choices, meat was so tender  and shrimp and eggplant was out of this world...hehe!! Delicious food and amazing service! Must have!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd attempt at Thai food since moving to Arizona. By far the best out of the 3. Place is super clean and staff was friendly. Lunch specials are very affordable and come with soup or salad. Might become my go to for lunch as it's super close to work."}
{"text":"This place was very clean and had friendly staff.. The food was good, my BF and I ordered Thai egg rolls, calamari and Thai fried rice.. And we liked it that it closed half an hour later during their lunch hours compared to most places that closed at 2:30.. We will definitely come back here.."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's nothing short of amazing. The service is always excellent, tentative and every server is very pleasant. Thai food is my favorite, and I've tried Thai food all over and every time I wish it was chon thai because they are THAT good. Nothing else compares to this establishment."}
{"text":"We had the drunken noodles and red curry. The food was delicious. Pat, the owner, was very hospitable and kind. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I got the drunken beef noodles for lunch and they were delicious. The place is clean and servers very friendly. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant after reading all the Yelp reviews. It was probably the best Thai food we have ever had, and we have tried many Thai restaurants. We had the chon chicken rolls, the red curry, and a chicken peanut sauce dish (forgot the name). The owners were super friendly and even gave us the sticky rice on the house (which by the way was incredible!). We will DEFINITELY be regular customers and this will be our new favorite Thai restaurant in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Very good food and reasonable. Good service and large menu. Our first time here... we'll be back. We had Pad See Ew and it was authentic and nicely done and presented."}
{"text":"I had a takeaway today, seemed to be a sit and eat place. Very nice atmosphere with Thai background music. Thank God for that, some places play pop music!! 

Had a green curry vegetarian recommend by the host. Couldn't resist, ordered Spring roll for my taste buds. The curry was exceptional. Spring roll was spring roll, nothing extraordinary. For that Schezwan palace is best.

Definitely recommend. Said they can make anything vegetarian on the menu. Have to test that one out."}
{"text":"Great place to wind down!! Amazing food! Try the sticky rice desert it's awesome. Very classy and calming atmosphere . Staff was amazing as well! I will defiantly come back."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere new to eat while in Chandler for work and saw Chon's was highly rated on here. So I headed on over and I'm so incredibly happy with making that decision. My experience at Chon's was one of the utmost best I have had in any restaurant. Pat immediately greeted me as I entered with a truly happy smile and hand shake. I told him I liked spicy and asked what he recommended. He said to try the Panang Curry, so that is what I ordered  (Thai hot). Not only was it exceptionally delicious but the presentation was fantasic!!!! The serving staff was amazing as well and made sure I was pleased with the dish. Pat was very sincere that I enjoyed my experience there and was so humble and thankful for my business. I don't even live close to Chon Thai Food but I will be back time and time again. It is a must have dining experience."}
{"text":"Started coming here last winter and spring, love all their vegetables that are used in their dishes, always fresh.  It's always hard to find fresh sweat tomatoes but they never failed to deliver always great tomatoes. We ordered \"Drucken Noodles\"  and as always made just right.  We've eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants around the West but this place is consistent,  never failed to deliver a fresh hearty plate. What really impressed me and my wife was they remembered us from last spring and new exactly what my wife likes, that alone is worth it.  Will always go here for Thai food we travel here from Casa Grande."}
{"text":"Really great Thai food!  I tried the drunken noodles and it was absolutely delish.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We came for dinner yesterday with the whole family for the first time. The food was mediocre, but the service was horrible. One of the tomatoes on my plate still had the sticker on it, the owner took the tomato, peeled it off and gave it right back. We ordered the sticky rice with mango, the mangoes were frozen. You do get 5% off if you use cash!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner based on the reviews here.  The food is so amazing!!  We had soup and panang curry, both of which were some of the best phase ever tried.  They also have Thai tea that is so good!

I will have to come back before I leave AZ!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Food was tasty. I prefer brown rice but I didn't inquire. Otherwise I'll be back. That are under new management so drop in and give them a try. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to eat lunch last weekend and I was amazed to taste such fresh and traditional Thai food.  Flavors were excellent and food cooked to perfection.  Their was a very sweet Thai lady serving us.  She was extremely attentive and asked us several times if the flavor and spices were okay.  I give this restaurant a 5 star because it was truly a perfect experience!"}
{"text":"The best Thai place in the valley. I absolutely love this place. My husband & I have been coming here since they opened. They serve authentic great tasty food with friendly service. We haven't had a bad experience so far. Interior is very clean & nice too."}
{"text":"Excelent authentic Thai food. Clean restaurant and bathrooms. Fair prices. Very pleasant and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, and really delicious Pad Thai. Will definitely be back!!! Great prices!
Very good Thai food, and I'm glad they are close to my work."}
{"text":"Just had the yellow curry with seafood. .. was fantastic I will definitely go back. The staff was unbelievably great."}
{"text":"Arrived in Phoenix after a long day of travel and were looking forward to good Thai food. With all the positive reviews we gave this place a try and it was awful. My husband's food was bland (never had to ask for salt at a Thai restaurant before) and mine had no flavor but was extremely hot (ordered medium). Every time we asked for something (like peanut sauce), we were told it would be $2. We paid with a card, only to learn we were charged a \"non-cash\" fee! Too pricey for subpar, bland food and poor service."}
{"text":"We loved this place. The staff did such a great job and were so friendly. Our food was fast and it has become my new Thai favorite. Check it out"}
{"text":"This is an awesome Thai place I went there last night I ordered Yum Nua, Pad Thai and Fried banana with coconut ice cream they were awesome. \"Chon Thai\" I will come back"}
{"text":"Finding good Thai Food is not hard. Finding really good Thai Food is slightly more complex. Discovering exquisite Thai Food is a journey. After many years of searching for Thai Food of this quality, I can now close the journal on this expedition. Not more than 2 miles from our residence lies this paradise for the appreciative pallet of Asian Cuisine.

We ordered Tom Yum Goong, Beef Noodle soup, Thai Basil Chicken Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and to start, Chon Thai Chicken Rolls. The flavors were vibrant and memorable. Textures and temperatures were wonderful. And the presentation was inviting! We already discussed our next visit and potential culinary candidates.

The staff was amazing, tentative, and accurate! With amazing food and service this wonderful we happily recommend Chon Thai Food to all yelpers! Happy eating and enjoy life!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Thai food and very friendly service. Tom Kha soup is so good and we were pleasantly suprised with the price. Will be back."}
{"text":"My dining experience at Chon Thai was perfect in every way. The presentation was exceptional, the flavors were unique and delicious, and the service was top notch. My only complaint is that I wish I found out about this place sooner."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Thai food and what a treat! The food and the service were stellar. Som was really great, super attentive and helped us decide what to order. The Tom Kha soup was my favorite. My daughter had the yellow curry which was also delicious. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. It is a must try! Things tend toward the spicy side. They'll ask you how spicy on a scale of 1-5. I ordered a 2 and it was super spicy. If you're sensitive, go with the 1 and you will still have plenty of spice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom. She got the pad see ew and I got the pad thai. Both lunch specials. We decided to go with the house soup for our side. It was just a simple vegetable soup which was tasty. The pad see ew was off... it tasted slightly overcooked. Some of her chicken was a bit burnt. Not enough sauce as well in my opinion. The pad thai tasted better. They also gave me a pretty large portion which was nice. Service was friendly. They didn't have the mango sticky rice when we went. She informed us it's a seasonal item."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great go-to Thai restaurant since we moved to the Phoenix metro area 3 years ago. And, I've finally found it! Woo hoo! 

Were these the best ever thai dishes I've had? Well, no, but Seattle has some really fantastic Thai restaurants. Chon Thai had really good dishes all around which is not something I've found in Seattle. I was super impressed.

I was not super-impressed with the to-go wait time (they told us 15 minutes and it was more like 30 minutes.) However, due to the really goodness of the food I am not going to count that!

Also, they are able to make many dishes gluten free. So AWESOME!

My favorite thing was the Pad Kee Mao (they call it drunken noodles). But everything we got was really good. 

We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"The reviews on yelp are misleading. Not sure how its possible for this place to get almost perfect rating of 5 stars. The service was great. Other than that it's just an average Thai place to be generous. The food was ok, nothing special. The meat wasn't fresh. The portion was way too small for the price. There's even a funny smell when walking inside the restaurant. Probably would not return."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food and fantastic customer service.  I ordered the green curry chicken for carry out and was quoted a time of 15-20 minutes.  We arrived around 4pm so the restaurant was not busy at all.  After paying for my food I walked back to my car to wait out the 15 minutes.  When I started walking back to the restaurant to pick up my food, the man who had taken my order walked out of the restaurant with my food to deliver it to me so that I didn't have to walk all the way up to the restaurant.  Talk about great customer service!!!

The green curry was delicious! Tasted authentic to me! Can't wait to come back here when I visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"They have THE best Pad Thai I have ever had!!!!!! The Cashew Chicken and Pad Se Lew were excellent as well...and each was under) $7 at lunch! YUMMY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What happens when really good food is topped by stellar service?  Five stars!

I was invited out by \"Aunt\" Jib, to try out her family's new Thai restaurant.  After informing our waiter of this, and he lit up like a Christmas tree.  This guy was very happy... like a happy that's contagious...

Looking at the apps, we decided on their Chon Thai Chicken rolls, which were fabulously crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside, by what I can only assume to be potatoes???  It was served with a sweet spicy sauce and diced cucumbers and red onions, which gave it nice crunch and fresh flavor.

The Chicken Tom Kha was delicious, with its coconut broth and bobbing mushrooms.

My companion ordered the Drunken Beef Noodles and I went with the Panang Curry with Beef.  I adored both dishes, but was even more impressed when the waitress told me that I can call ahead, and place a special order for mussamun (pronounced \"muss a mun\", not \"moose sa moon\") curry, as its not on the menu.  

For me?  You'd make a special dish just for me?  WHO DOES THAT?!?!

Then, as if they hadnt been kind enough, our waiter asks us not to go anywhere because he has a surprise.  A surprise for me?  What could it be?  A sword?  Clown makeup?  Singing lessons?  Wonderful gift ideas raced through my mind, but none were as tasty as the mango and sticky rice dessert which was placed before us.

On our way out, my companion mentioned to our waiter, how much we enjoyed his service, and he said that her words was the nicest thing that's happened all day.  My companion said he was the nicest thing that's happened all day."}
{"text":"We ordered the red chicken curry (Thai hot), Pad see ew (Thai hot) and Thai tea..

Our server is Thai, and she was nice and accommodating. 

The restaurant has a Thailand feel and tidy and clean..

We both ordered the lunch specials for only $5.99 the dinner price is $7.99

This is our new place to get Thai food!! Affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! SO delicious!!! Ray was super sweet and provided spectacular service!!! We had the BBQ chicken, medium shrimp pineapple curry, medium chicken pad Thai, medium cashew chicken, and hot sweet and sour chicken. Plenty of food for five people and leftovers for later! We will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and was your typical thai restaurant. Simple lunch specials at a very good price but it didn't really stand out. It's a cute, clean place and the service was good. Just not a huge WOW factor with regards to flavor of the noodles or soups."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. I got the lunch special thai fried rice to go. Presentation was awesome. They have 5 levels of spice and 3- hot is HOT. Good overall but my dish could have used a little more chicken."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp so me and daddy dearest decided to give it a shot!! The staff here was super sincere, helpful, attentive, and friendly!!! The food, although it isn't up there with some of the best/most authentic Thai food I've had, was still decent.

1. Papaya Salad: there was too much like so it had a bit of a bitter finish, was a bit too acidic and missing a bit of touch of sweet. 
2. Beef Panang Curry: this was quite tasty!!! Super flavorful, rich, creamy, veggies were cooked perfectly, and the beef was surprisingly tender and moist!!! Generous amount of beef included too!!
3. Shrimp Pad Thai: was a touch on the sour side and the noodles were quite a bit thinner than what we're used to but the shrimp was cooked to perfection!!
4. Pad Prik Kow: this didn't taste like what I'm used to but it was still flavorful and fresh!

Food wise, I would give this place between 3.5-4 stars but because the service and atmosphere was so wonderful and relaxing, I'm giving this place a 5! We'll definitely be back!!!!! : )"}
{"text":"The family and I had a hard time finding a restaurant that would take a reservation for ten (a strange problem to have).  Chon Thai was very accommodating and making the reservation was very easy.  Once we arrived at the restaurant and the food started coming we realized what a gem we had found.  Because we had such a large party we sampled a ton of things and absolutely everything was delicious.  My favorites were the crispy garlic chicken and the panang curry, and the chicken spring rolls.  The service was outstanding and the prices were really reasonable.  We will be back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in the valley. Their soups and fried rices are absolutely delicious. Their Thai hot isnt really that hot (7/10) and medium is kinda mild."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Arizona so far!   Pad thai and Tom ka soup were wonderful.   Nice decor and wait staff.  Fresh well cooked vegetables."}
{"text":"Their coconut soup is to die for and don't get me started on their crab delights (fried wontons with cream cheese). Thumbs UP!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and trust me it won't be our last!  The food was authentic and amazing. The service was great and if you love Thai food this is your place."}
{"text":"Feeling sort of sad.   The crab puff was frozen.    I don't mean frozen and then cooked.   I mean the interior was frozen when I bit it.  What happened to my old love? I used to be so enthralled. Now the medium spices are so hot I choke.  Please come back.    I miss you.  

Recent visits have been way better so I am adding stars to my review.  The food is once again fresh and artfully prepared.  Great job chef!  Delicious! Thanks for your effort!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai restaurant in Chandler.  As soon as we walked up, the host opened the door and we were greeted with a huge smile, I could tell I was gonna really enjoy my dining experience tonight.  I could just feel the positive energy.  The Tom Kha Veggie soup was really really delicious!  I also had Beef Pad Thai (medium spicy) and it was also amazing.  The \"medium\" level of spicy wasn't as hot as other Thai Restaurants I've been to.  I could of probably went spicier but the medium was still really good, didn't leave my mouth burning hahaha. The service was excellent and the food was even better.  It did take a bit longer then I expected for the food to come out but no biggie, you could tell everything was made fresh not just thrown into a wok and heated up.  We will be back when we're in the area!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I eat at Chon Thai at least twice a week. That's how addicted we are.
Their yellow curry is to die for. My extremely  picky-eater bf fell in love with it since the first time he tried it.
I kept trying the different dishes they have. So far, my favorite is Pad Gratium. That thing is the bomb. Get it Thai Hot if u love spice and you'll be in heaven. :D
Just writing this review is making me feel like going to get Chon Thai for dinner. 
The service is awesome there. Ppl there make u feel extra welcome and attended to."}
{"text":"I have a Love/Hate relationship with this place.  Their food is very good, and it is a good value for what you get, but the service stinks.  On one occasion, a busy Sat,  night we sat in the back corner and were never approached by a server  I finally had to ask for menus and some service.  The waitress ran around like a chicken with her head cut off, and never checked back.  It was like we were invisible. The next visit, (a non busy night) we sat in view of the kitchen, so they would not forget us.  They served my BF's meal and said mine would be right up.  !5 minutes later it still had not arrived.  We saw a meal that had been sitting in the delivery window for quite some time.  2 people had passed it several times, but no one bothered to deliver it.  Guess who's meal it was?  That's right, mine. For better Food, Service, and a ambiance my pick is Yupha's ."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! The food is delicious every time and it never disappoints me. The service and very friendly staff are on top of it. My favorite Thai Food restaurant in Chandler for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is always on point and friendly staff. Would recommend to anyone who loves Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. This place opened five days ago and I'm so glad it did! The service is fantastic- our waiter was very attentive and super excited that we came in. The food was absolutely delicious and very reasonable. I had shrimp pad Thai and a Thai iced tea and it was under $12. My friend's meal and drink was under $10. The atmosphere is also perfect. The music is relaxing and the decor is spot on. Highly recommend to anyone who wants a delicious and relaxing meal!"}
{"text":"Good foods, good prices and their hospitality is the one that make them awesome! It's close by from my work so that's cool. I go here once a week to try each meal. My favorite is Panang Beef Curry! :)

10% discount for dinner!"}
{"text":"I am a big big fan of this place!!!!

I've been here several times since it was first opened last year and I have never been disappointed once! 

First, the quality of the food is definitely one of the best in the Valley. I have probably tried half of the menu at this point: salad, soup, noodle, curry, desserts, and everything so far has been fantastic. Be sure to stop by their lunch special during weekdays. Great value for the price you pay. 

Second, the customer service provided is second to none. The staff are so polite and attentive. My water was never even half empty - they were genuinely happy that you stop by their restaurant. 

Last, the decor is traditional with a modern twist. Open space, sometimes I wish they could add few more table to reduce the wait during busy hours.

{"text":"My wife and I decided to give Chon Thai Food a try on a Friday night.  We arrived about 6:15pm and to our surprise there weren't may people in the restaurant at all.  With more than 360 Yelp reviews, I expected a larger crowd but like many Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area business here could be concentrated at lunch time.  

In terms of the food, this was some of the best tasting Thai food I've had.  I ordered the Tom Kha Chicken soup and the Drunken Beef Noodles with Thai Hot Spices.  My wife shared the Tom Kha soup and had the Drunken Chicken Noodles with Medium Spices.  The Tom Kha soup was exceptional with a nice aromatic broth, flavorful added spices, and the perfect amount of chicken and vegetables.  The Drunken Noodles had a really nice flavor with the perfect amount of protein and vegetables.  The only complaint I'd have on the Drunken Noodles is that the noodles themselves were too fine and chopped up and there weren't quite enough noodles for the dish.  Overall food is 4.5/5 

The service was attentive and efficient.  The server checked-in with our table at appropriate intervals.  Our water and ice was kept full and they checked to make sure our dishes met our expectations.  Overall service is a 4/5.  

In the 'Other' category, I do have to deduct a half a star because the menu prices on the website are quite outdated (from 6/2016), and of course the prices are lower on the website than at the restaurant.  This could possibly cause a perceived bait and switch situation.  They should just update the website because the restaurant prices today are still quite reasonable, especially when you consider the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Taken me long enough to review. What was I thinking! This place rocks! It's a weekly (regularly multiple times a week) stop. The food is always good and the staff/owners are super awesome and friendly. The owners make you feel so welcome that I like going in just to see them. Super laid back and relaxed too. 

Great place!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.

I came here to meet other yelper's for the first time and they couldn't have picked a better spot. I'm not usually a huge Thai food person, but was seriously surprised by the food here. The layout and decor was beautiful and clean, and service was prompt and courteous.

Thanks to the group I tried several dishes I had never had before (I usually always order pad thai lol) the pumpkin curry was to die for, the papaya salad was quite refreshing, and the pineapple fried rice was delicious. For appetizers the calamari and tom yum soup are both highly recommended. Plus they have one of the best thai teas I have had anywhere.

Chandler has a lot of great food options, and this should be considered one of the best I would think, more exploration of the area will confirm, but based on past Thai experiences, it is easily a top spot for me."}
{"text":"After attempting to go to a new ramen restaurant in the far east valley (and them being unexpectedly closed...ugh) my friend and I had to come up with a quick plan b for lunch. I had had Chon's bookmarked forever and felt it was just as good a time as any to check it out. This place has legit lunch specials...like 6$ for a full meal with soup and an eggroll.... no joke, it's fabulous! I got the drunken noodles and asked for them very spicy....they delivered! My eyes and nose were running, it was fabulous. I will definitely return to this fabulous find!"}
{"text":"We frequent this place at least twice a month, if not more. The customer service is excellent, but more than that the food is incredible. Crisp veggies, delicious Pad Thai, creamy curry, fantastic pineapple fried rice. This place has a great atmosphere, perfect for date night or Friday afternoon lunch. The place is clean. The customer service is fantastic. And the food.. THE FOOD."}
{"text":"Chon Thai is truly the best Thai food that I have had in the United States.  I travel frequently to Asia and I know what the real stuff is like.  It isn't quite as good as you could get in Thailand, but it sure is as good as you can get in the United States.  

Service:  unbelievable.  The staff was polite, friendly, courteous, helpful, and far better than I have had except at restaurants that are 10x this price.  

Food:  I asked for Thai Hot and it was indeed spicy.  It was the second hottest that I have had in the United States, and it wasn't just a bunch of chili oil dumped in.  It had the fine balance of spices that make you crave for more even though your mouth is on fire.  The ingredients were fresh and the chef knew exactly how to get the best taste.  It wasn't just a line chef that they hired from the street corner to dump a bag of frozen junk into a fryer.  This person was highly trained.  

I am from Boulder, CO and made a detour just to try out the 5-star Yelp rated Thai restaurant on my way to California for the holidays.  I made a similar 2-hour detour on my way back home just to get some more of the delectable stuff.  It blows your mind.  My son had the biggest smile that I have ever seen him have from a restaurant (he is a young foody).  Most yelp ratings are paid advertisements, but this one is truly legit.  

Thanks Chon Thai for making a perfect start and finish to my Christmas road trip!  We will be back..."}
{"text":"Five stars for service, food and left overs! Lol! 

Walked in and it wasn't too busy on a weekday. Was seated quickly and food came out fast. We ordered chicken dumplings and spring rolls to start. Crispy garlic chicken and another chicken dish as well as Pad Thai was for dinner. It was way to much food and we all left stuffed. We also had 2 plates of leftovers. The flavors of all the dishes were amazing!

We'll make the 20min drive to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Ordered the calamari, pad Thai, and Thai iced tea.  They nailed the spicy level I asked for and the food was very tasty.  Super friendly staff that was always attentive.  Going again for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with my family. Enjoyed the place great food and friendly staff. Got a little busy right when we got in but they got our appetizers in a decent amount of time for the wait. Had garlic chicken tasted amazing. Work down the street so I will definitely be going here for lunch another time."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai place in the valley and I've been to many of the ones in Yelp looking for the real deal."}
{"text":"When you eat food that's too hot and start breathing like Mu Shu the Dragon.

I was invited by Jib W. to try out this new family-owned restaurant and everything went great!  They have only been opened just shy of a month and the place had a steady stream of customers throughout the night.  I was pretty excited by the time we were seated.  Since this is a family-owned restaurant, the service was excellent.  From the tall courteous waiter to the young sweet waitress, everyone here was super friendly.  After browsing the menu for a bit, we had decided to order a Tom Kha Chicken, Chicken Pumpkin Curry, Crispy Panang Chicken, and shared a Fried Banana with Ice Cream for dessert.  

If you know me, you know I love me some Tom Kha and their Tom Kha is super fragrant.  It was delicious, had great citrus flavor, and super smooth.  I just love hot and sour coconut soup!  My only regret is not getting the large like I originally wanted.  The small is a good size but it was just too good to be shared. 

Now I'm normally a creature of habit and usually order massaman curry but the Chicken Pumpkin Curry piqued my interest --- so glad I ordered this.  I seriously couldn't stop eating.  I didn't miss the potatoes in a massaman curry at all because the pumpkin was AMAZING.  I loved the texture.  And at medium spice, it was absolutely perfect.  

As for the Crispy Panag Chicken, it was delish.  I didn't put 2 and 2 together to realize we ordered two curry dishes on top of our coconut milk based soup so I was overwhelmed by coconut milk and that food coma afterwards hit hard [like a little baby who had too much milk lol].  

And when we were stuffed to the brim and contemplating on going to EOS Fitness afterwards, we were offered dessert and just couldn't say no.  A beautiful dish of Fried Banana with a mountain of Ice Cream and whipped cream was placed in front of us.  We shared a look of, \"What did we get ourselves in to?\" before diving in.  I've been scarred in the past from soggy fried bananas in grossly thick tempura batter but this place does no such thing.  Had I been wearing a skirt, it would have flipped!  The ice cream had coconut and maybe some pineapple in it and it was good.  Like really really good.  The bananas stayed crisp and was perfect.  Although we were happily full, we managed to eat the whole thing.  No shame.

All in all, it was a perfect dinner --- amazing service, a clean modern restaurant, some soft tunes in the background, and delicious food!  And with Chon Thai Food being two miles away from home, I will DEFINITELY be back!  Seriously, come stop by this great Thai eatery.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food left something to be desired. It was clean and good presentation but the food was bland and cold. I had the Chon Thai Rama and the sauce was too thick. There was little spinach and the broccoli needed steamed longer. My friend had the pad Thai. It was a little mushy. This place got great reviews so I must either be picky, been to better places or caught them on a bad day. But again, awesome service, good price and I loved the Thai coffee."}
{"text":"Drove 12 miles to a restaurant that shows open on their website..... says open at 11. Its 1140 now, the owners pull up, run in and leave telling me this location is closed today. Not a very good first ompression."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, so I eat at a lot of Thai restaurants.  This is one of the best ever.  Food was a cut above the usual Thai restaurant and everything seemed to be made from scratch.  Even the spring rolls were homemade.  Presentation was also a cut above.  Service was also a cut above.  Only thing I could fault them on is the decor is typical shoe string budget Asian restaurant.  Obviously they didn't have a lot of capital.  No mystery as the lunch specials are $5.99!!!! Was worth three times that even with the decor.  Overall it is a delightful discovery.  Will return every time I come to Chandler area."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience ! We celebrated my 55 birthday yesterday and found this place on Yelp . The staff are super friendly and the food was filled with flavour . We were all very impressed! I think we just found our new Thai restaurant:)))"}
{"text":"Had two birthdays to celebrate.  Decided to go to our favorite Thai restaurant and everyone loved it! Even won over one guest who claimed he did not like Thai food!! 

Chon Thai always satisfies our cravings for good food.  They were able to accommodate our large party, but we did call ahead for reservations.

Highly recommend this restaurant, good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Arizona I've had so far... And it only gets better with their prices, service and all.
Tasty food, full menu and they even cater well to vegetarians. 
Ordered the Tom Kha Soup and the Panang Curry and they were both perfect!
The Thai tea was only $2 and it was a large glass that tasted amazing. 
Definitely a hidden treasure.
Need Thai food? Come here ..."}
{"text":"We were craving Thai food so we decided to try somewhere a little closer to home than where we usually go. The restaurant is pretty spacious and has some cool decor. Service was friendly and our server was really nice. We ordered papaya salad which had good flavor but they also add lettuce in the dish which I've never had it that way before. The lettuce gave it a weird taste and we felt like it didn't belong in there and it was kinda used as a \"filler\" for the papaya salad. We got a small bowl of Tom Kha soup with chicken and that was eh. They chop in big pieces of fresh onions and the onions were total overkill and tasted like onion soup. The soup was missing the zing and tang you'd normally taste in there, which made us a little sad. For our main entrees, we got pad Thai and crispy panang chicken. The pad Thai had great flavor and the portion size was pretty big, but they use a different noodle to make their pad Thai, so it didn't really feel like we were eating pad Thai. The crispy panang chicken is just a deconstructed panang curry dish where everything that would go in the curry comes out on a plate with a bowl of plain panang curry and steamed veg. It was interesting and the chicken was crunchy and the veggies were steamed nicely, not too soggy, but I probably wouldn't order that again. Overall, the service was good, the food was good but not great, and the quality and presentation is good. We will probably be back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Great prices and their Pad Thai and Green Curry get my seal of approval  Authentic and delicious :)"}
{"text":"The food here is great, especially the lunch menu! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because I brought my boyfriend here from out of town and raved to him about this place. Too bad when we went there for dinner at around 7:30 p.m., we not only waited to be seated in a half empty restaurant, but we waited over an hour for our food. They seemed well-staffed which is why we couldn't understand why we had to wait so long. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to a bad night at Chon's."}
{"text":"Great flavor and very affordable. We had pad thai, pineapple shrimp curry, and chicken pic. Order mild if you cant tolerate spicy. Do try the thai tea! It's perfect!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the spicy eggplant. It was delicious Thai food and not too pricey.  The motif was arranged to look cozy. Cute place, good food."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I had the Pad Thai, which was prepared differently from how I've ever had it. Still recognizable Pad Thai. Staff was awesome.  Good ambiance, if not a bit loud -- loud b/c it was so full of people who love this place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was invited by Jib to try out this new Thai restaurant a month ago. Since I was in the neighborhood and the weather is cold today, I figured this is the perfect day to try out spicy/hot Thai food. 

The interior of this restaurant is very modern and beautifully designed. I love the paintings and mirrors that are hang on the walls. When we first walked in, we were greed by a very friendly waitress. We started out by ordering Thai iced tea and egg rolls as an appetizer.  Their tea has the perfect portion of milk, tea and sweetness. I would have ordered another one if I had more room in my stomach. Egg rolls are very crispy, non-greasy and it goes very well with the sweet sauce that it was served with. For entrees, my friend ordered Red Curry chicken with rice (Thai spicy) and I ordered Drunken noodles with beef (medium hot). The curry is very tasty but it too hot for my taste. They offered generous portion of beef for my drunken noodles and it was so delicious. For dessert, we ordered Mango with sticky rice. Mango is so sweet with the perfect portion of rice covering with mouth watering coconut juice. Even though I was full, I finished 90% of it in less than 5 minutes. 

Jib's cousin stopped by to introduce himself and I also saw a older lady coming out from the kitchen to check on the business. As we crossed eye contact, she smiled at me from a distance. Generally speaking, I do not expect much customer service or cleanness from Asian restaurants. Not this one - they blew my mind away. Jib - thank you so much for inviting me to this family owned restaurant. Food is delicious and well decorated, the restaurant is clean and offers great customer service. I will definitely come back here again and I highly recommend this Thai restaurant to all Elite yelpers."}
{"text":"I ordered a beef dish and it tasted like a lamb. I didn't like the food. Service is good."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in the valley.  While the portions are smaller than most (if not all) Thai places I've encountered in the east valley, the food and the presentation, and the nice service, make up the difference.  Their curries have gotten me through many feverish nights when I had colds.  Better than any Nyquil :)"}
{"text":"This was one of the best Thai food restaurants I've been to. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was great, and they have the hardest working and friendliest waitresses I've seen. I very strongly recommend this restaurant and look forward to going again when I'm in Phoenix."}
