{"text":"I'm the kind of carnivore who has to be reminded sometimes that vegetables exist. This means I can be pretty easily satisfied by any old pile of grilled meat when I'm starving.   However.   I had the Meat Lover sandwich and was immediately struck by how well put together it was.  All the ingredients tasted fantastic and they all blended exceptionally well together. Sam had the roast beef, and we kept murmuring to each other \"this is an amazing sandwich, buddy\".  Definitely up there with the best I've had."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  What an oasis this place is.  I've watched several low-end, seventy-for-one pizza shops move in and out of this locale over the years.  So when the \"coming soon\" signs went up, I could smell the schadenfreude.  But thankfully that smell was quickly replaced by aromas of great cooking.   Everything is incredibly fresh and inviting.  A great variety of prepared salads and main dishes to go along with fresh juices and other goodies.  Asparagus and caramelized onions in one salad, green beans and other goodies in another. A frozen section offers chef-made lasagnas, meat pies and other other goodies.   Meatloaf that looks good enough to make you say things you though you'd never say, like \"Hey, I think I'd like some meatloaf.\"   Pizzas are thin crust with creative combos like roasted almond & basil pesto.    On a monday at dinner time, the place is hopping.  Clearly, I'm not the only one glad to see someone reclaiming this retail space in the name of quality and deliciousness."}
