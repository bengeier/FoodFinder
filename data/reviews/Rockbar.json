{"text":"When your car breaks down in Arizona, there's no better place to be stuck than at this bar.  Also there's a dope bartender named Lindsey. Seriously though, she's cool."}
{"text":"Great music and bartenders.I try to stop in every time I am in the area for a drink."}
{"text":"Great time here last night. Super service from Cassie. Great crowd and a fun trivia game. Prices were very reasonable. Stopped in for one drink and it turned into 5. I was a regular here years ago when this location was Acme. It has gotten even better and I look forward to many more visits. Cheers"}
{"text":"Rockbar has become a regular spot on my rotation of favorite places to go. I'm in love with the way they remodeled it since acme...and to be honest the staff has become like family. They've got a great vibe at rockbar, and plenty of live music acts. It's a great place to unwind and get silly."}
{"text":"Best place for live music and cool, down to earth people. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The one bright spot in Scottsdale if your a 40 year old music lover.  Hope it works out for them, love the live music!!!"}
{"text":"Hated it . Took 68 mins and no food no explanation or apologies.  Totally unexceptable . My wife and I are both in the restaurant business. They  Never tried to make it right.  Will never go back or recommend this place. We came here from Philly and was looking for a hood bar to goto watch the Eagles . We are still in search of.  If you are the owner of the rock bar, I would have a talk with your staff and have some hands on training. We were there for 80 mins and your staff were never trained correctly and your customer service is horrible.  Good luck"}
{"text":"The best bar in old town by far. Awesome staff, great music and on point drink prices. I love this place because it doesn't get the drifters from El Hefe and all those bars across the way. Good people and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Rock bar rocks. Went there Sat night before Christmas with a couple friends. No cover... not sure why?  Perhaps it was too early... or maybe it was the beautiful red headed model type that took us there...    Anyway, the band was playing their version of 70's hard rock good and loud (awesome by the way).  Went up to the 2nd floor patio bar and the bartender was friendly, pretty and skilled in proper pours.  The owner actually walked over and made sure we were having a good time (that's how you run a service biz by the way) and we had a great time.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our first and last time visiting this bar. The bar actually has a good ambiance and good live music. Unfortunately, when we closed out our tab, we mysteriously had an excessive number of drinks on our bill. When we tried to get the issue resolved, the bartender who also said he was the \"manager\" was nothing short of rude and even offered to \"settle it outside.\" An employee of an establishment behaves this way to a customer? Fortunately we can dispute the charge with the bank but it's this suspect business practice that people should consider when deciding to visit this business"}
{"text":"I just found out he decided to give himself a bigger tip than I had originally put on the receipt.  I am so disappointed in my last experience here on Sunday night. I've been to Rockbar a million times and have never experienced such horrible service. I've had some really close friends work here in the past and have always had a great experience.  I came in here on Sunday night with my fiance and some friends/co workers to celebrate my birthday.. We were the ONLY ones there besides a couple people at the end of the bar which were clearly either regulars, employees or just friends of the bartenders.  We ordered a round for all of us and went upstairs to play pool. The bartender wasn't exactly happy and excited we were in there by any means.. No \"Hey how are you\", no smile, no nothing.... but eh.. Whatever no big deal...(Even though in my opinion, if we are going to be practically your only customers I would think you would be a little more friendly). None of us thought anything of it until we go get our next round.  Let me just point out 3 of us in that group are bartenders in Old Town... There were about 4 of us standing at the bar waiting for the bartender so we can buy another round... Again, no one else was in there except us and the bartenders buddies.  We're just standing there... Standing there... Standing there... Just staring at the bartender talk to his friend for over 10 minutes while we were all standing there waiting. He was about 5 feet away from us so you can't tell me he didn't see us... He just didn't care... Not even his buddy (who I think works there) said \"Oh hey you have customers at the bar\"  No one cared...I almost said something but my gf just said to let it go... So I did... After exchanging numbers with this guy and finishing his conversation he finally decided to do his job.. So we get a round, pay and go back upstairs.  We're having a good time just playing pool on the upstairs deck.  It's time for another round so I personally stayed upstairs while some of our group when back down to get drinks. Next thing you know my fiance comes up and says \"we gotta go that bartender is being a straight dick\" Let me just point out that my fiance and my friend who went down there that time are some of the nicest most patient people I know so when I find out that they both just wanted to leave because of him, I knew something went wrong.  Apparently the bartender asked them \"How many more waters are you going to order?\" Umm...we literally ordered ONE water the whole time we were there.  So at that point my friend said \"You know what man, we're just going to close out\" Because why would any of us want to continue giving this guy money with his shitty attitude.. I'm downstairs and out the door at this point waiting for him to close out and watching all of this unfold. I knew my friend didn't tip because of how this bartender was and for good reason. He didn't deserve money from any of us.  So the bartender asked \"Is everything alright?\" And my friend said \"Oh yeah we're just going to have some fun somewhere else\"  And the bartender said \"Everythings alright but you tip me 0?\" And then this regular/employee/friend of the bartender sitting at the bar pulls out cash and gives it to the bartender saying whatever she was saying to my friend.  So I finally intervene and needed to back up my friend and went up to the bar and said \"You've been completely unpleasant all night long and would rather sit and talk to your buddy for 20 minutes while we're sitting waiting to get drinks. We bartend in old town and this is how you treat your customers?\"  He, no joke, says \"Ohh here we goo.. The whole, we work in old town shit\"  And at that point I'm just like really? This is how you treat your ONLY customers? Wtf. And then the girl next to us starts spoutin off asking me like 5 times if I knew the owners?? Umm..wtf does that have to do with anything? And I told her \"I hope your $2 tip makes up for his shitty ass attitude\" We left at that point but Jesus... If you are that miserable and hate your job, then go do something that makes you happy. Bad vibe, bad attitude and not what we were looking for on my birthday.  And again, we work in the service industry and we get people have bad days or you're super slammed but that guy clearly hates his job and is miserable. Making us really uncomfortable like we inconvenienced him. God forbid we come to a bar for some drinks and give you money! Which is why at the end my friend felt he didn't deserve anymore of our money and left him nothing. Let your friends, that you probably don't charge, tip you. We're out.  Seriously though, my fiance and my friends are some of the nicest people and patient and don't ever let things like that bother them unless it really gets to a point like it did that night.  Like we're paying you and giving you money and this is how you treat your only customers?  This guy needs to go, seriously has a bad vibe and makes me not want to go back there."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how offensive and drunk the owner was. He's lucky I did not punch him in the face for accosting my wife. She has bruises on her wrist."}
{"text":"Was visiting Scottsdale and went to the Rockbar!  Best night ever.  Great crowd, amazing service.  Will definitely be heading back when I'm in town.  My new fave bar!"}
{"text":"This is the best bar in Scottsdale, PERIOD!!!  Great prices on drinks, the hottest female bartenders in town and they are very friendly too!!  The ownership is amazing and very involved in the business so they make sure things in general are great.  Go get something to eat at one of the restaurants close by and then go there for a night of great music and entertainment.  Every time I have gone, it has been a 10."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Rockbar since the last I was there it was Acme.  They did a great job with the indoor outdoor configuration, the bartender was very attentive but was really dead.  Thought this place would be happening for happy hour on a Friday - obvisouly I was wrong.  Not to mention no kitchen  Like most comments on here, great place and location but was not hoppin' at all.  Will have to check out later in the evening when the band is there.  If it's still there : )"}
{"text":"Since I've been in Arizona, Rockbar has been the one place that has never disappointed. Everyone that works there is awesome, its like a big family. Great music, great drinks, great food, and all around good times any night of the week.   Overall, this is a solid bar."}
{"text":"Love the vibe & music. Good for sports during the day & fun at night for shows. The staff isn't the typical dbags & are adorable (both men & women). My only bitch might be that the place is plastered with Sailor Jerry ads which are cool but they don't have Sailor Jerry. Sad faces...but they have JD so that works for me too."}
{"text":"when I order food from a dive bar, are usually know what I'm getting. If it taste like it came out of a vending machine, it's usually decent. This was much worse. Worse than any vending machine could possibly spit out. The French dip sandwich tasted like it was made with old beef jerky. On the upside, the waitress came by our table every 20 minutes! The flat bread tasted like I forgot about it after pulling out of the microwave two weeks ago. I don't recommend these textures."}
{"text":"I went here due to my curiosity of the blend between rock music and the typical Scottsdale venue. Based upon my first experience, this place has potential - unlike the band I listened too.. but they at least had some passion.. no, that's not the word.. delusion, but enough about them.   I paid a cover to see a few bands, out of none I have ever heard of.. and most likely never will. I sat down at the bar and the girl behind the bar lip read my order (due to the high volume), and she did it flawlessly. I was very impressed.   The place itself is nice enough, and I am a big fan of the fact that you can sit outside on the other side of the bar. When it comes to the clientele there is a clash, because the establishment does not attract the real metal fans out there, but instead a glam-version of such. The people that want the grit of the image but still enjoy a decent cocktail. I have a hard time wrapping my head around it, and yet it does amuse me.   Overall I will give this place another shot, because it has great potential.. and since I imagine the clientele and atmosphere changes with the band, I might have just caught a slow night.   *** For you metalheads out there. This establishment does not cater to the metalhead, it caters to the occasional metal listener. This is not a posh version of a true rock bar, this is a fictitious Hollywood-up version of such establishment. For better or worse. ***"}
{"text":"Fun venue to hang and hear some GREAT music with sweet atmosphere! The Band We, Beloved was playing with The Shift and The Scorched. Sounded amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience Friday.  Paid cash for my first two drinks, $9.00 each for Kettle. When I asked for the bill, they provided a total of $29.00 without itemization. Upon request, the itemization was for 3 drinks instead of 1. I paid for two of them.  They refused to adjust the bill.  The bar manager was horrible and is loosing business for them!!! View the video footage, the blond girl in the maroon top arriving around 9:30 sitting next to a blind guy on the left and a drunk guy to my right.  The bar could have made it right for $2.00 and the bartender (girl) lost out on a tip refusing to acknowledge the mistake.  I've gone there over the last three years to support a band, Down For Whatever.  The band is great, but I'll never go and patronize a bar that tries to rip off customers.  I hate liars who have no customer service skills!!!!  I will tell share this experience with my friends.  The bar owner(s) need to make this right."}
{"text":"Worst \"rock\" bar I've ever been to. How does a bar that supports bands have only one entrance in and out? If I wasn't getting out of the way for the drums to get through the entrance, I was moving so the bar runners could bring ice, beer, garbage, bussed tables, and food through.   There is absolutely no room on the bottom floor to sit or watch or even enjoy the bands unless you reserved seats.    The bathrooms were disgusting and it's worth mentioning that there were tons of half empty drinks everywhere with one special glass having a used tampon in it. So nasty.   Lastly $10 for 2 beers one of those being a Coors Light. Just ridiculous and not worth driving an hour to.  (Oh and don't try calling them or emailing them for questions they don't answer the phone or reply back.)"}
{"text":"I spend a pretty fair amount in Scottsdale and the same old, same old bars can get a little trying.   It was a nice departure to hit Rockbar on a Friday night and enjoy the rock-a-billy bands downstairs and the chill, ambient mood upstairs on the rooftop deck.  It was definitely fun checking out the action in the alley nextdoor and the bartender could not have been sweeter.  Kinda limited on wine choices \"red or white\" at the downstairs bar and while my expectations aren't higher than \"anything but Chardonnay\" it was super nice of the upstairs bartender to run down an find something other than Chardonnay for me.....  Great view of the hip little Old Town hood and really comfy outdoor living furniture to relax in.   I would love this even more if it was in Chicago's Old Town"}
{"text":"Not super impressed.   Came here mid afternoon, it was dead.   Nobody acknowledged us for about 10 minutes. Watched all of the employees at the end of the bar talking about whatever was more important.   Once we were acknowledged, they were polite. But that took quite some time.   Typical sports bar, I've been to much better.   With all of the other places we could choose from, this was a place to which both my hubs and I agreed we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Good times! Great music in the main bar and excellent patio (kinda small) with free pool or you can lounge around on the comfy sofas! I'll be going back!  One letdown; outdoor bar seating in the main bar is closed off when the music starts playing so don't sit outside thinking you'll enjoy the view & the band while watching inside."}
{"text":"Well, I usually have wandered into and out of this bar pretty quickly on most nights. It is hit or miss with the crowds and usually half empty. As I was wandering around for football on Monday, the bar had an unusual green glow. Turns out that the Eagles have landed here and I mean every scummy Philly fan has found this place who lives within a 30 miles radius. The only cool person in the place was the Buffalo Bills bartender dude on the top level. Ok, full admission is that I'm a NY Giants fan, but luckily I was not wearing my gear because our two fan groups do not get along. I do give them credit for $3 Coors Lights all game, but the Philly Steak place next closed and they have Capriotti's doing food, which is like having Burger King cater your wedding. Still, if you like the Eagles and they happen to be playing, then it's your place and on the other times go upstairs for the great views or listen to the B level bands downstairs."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday night and had drinks and listened to the band. Had a great time"}
{"text":"We came here for a comedy show. Normally dive bars are great but this was very disappointing. They really should have known that having a special show they would need more than one bartender, or a bartender and a  server. We would have loved to order some food but we couldn't get the bartenders attention it was just to packed and once the comic started you wouldn't be able to hear anyways from a distance behind all the people packed around the bar. Never made it past our first round of drinks. I would try it one more time, maybe someone called in or something but we were hungry so that made us more grumpy about it!"}
{"text":"We were in on Monday looking for a nice rooftop bar to take our visiting friends to. We were the only people in the bar. The wine offering is one red and one white that come out of a tap. I realize that they probably don't sell a lot of wine. However, when I suggested to the bartender that the Cabernet had possibly gone bad, he told me I was wrong. Service was not welcoming or appreciative  or even offered on the rooftop. Will never patronize again or recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"This is a bar and venue that caters to rock. The establishment has two levels. The lower level has the main bar as well as the stage and ground outdoor wrap around patio while the second level (take the stairs behind the bar) has an outdoor bar and a 360 degree patio as well as a billiards table. The split level is very appealing, especially since the upper patio has some view of Scottsdale.   The establishment was very clean and the service was fast and friendly. A friend of ours had a bottle so I didn't order anything and therefore don't know what the drink prices are like."}
{"text":"If I could give a half star rating I would. This venue is full of life, love, memories, rockin' music, much respect...and hiccups. With some minor adjustments...this pub would be a killer place to hang."}
{"text":"Awesome place to see the birds win the Super Bowl! Great staff, space, atmosphere, etc. Security was 100%, waitstaff and bartenders all excellent. Everyone busted their asses.  Management really fell on their face with the kitchen. How could you expect the kitchen to handle 1500 people? People paid $250 per table, and many got there 6 hours before game start. You could have had food trucks or catering or ANYTHING except your usual small-capacity kitchen. Took 2 hours for a dozen wings, and then the kitchen stopped taking orders before halftime. People were getting food delivered from other restaurants. Management could have made the bar thousands of dollars more, and the waitstaff missed out on tons of tips because they couldn't sell food.  And you guys had a no glass outside policy, but you were selling buckets of bottles. Why? Honestly, why? You created a nightmare for your own staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Took my boyfriend here for his birthday and had an amazing time! Shay was getting here as we were walking up and let us come inside for a drink. Amazing service and great food... will definitely make the 30 min drive to come back!"}
{"text":"We came here for a drink on a Friday night and I must say, we didn't have the best experience! We sat at one of the booths/tables along the wall and since there was only 1 bartender running the entire place, service at the booth was very slow. My stepdad didn't get a drink for a LONG time so we eventually went up and ordered ourselves. I totally understand being short staffed but then maybe rope off/close the table area so that guests don't sit there and expect to be waited on. Just a suggestion!   As we were leaving around 9 PM, the live music was starting! They do have a great stage area and i'm sure this place in hopping during the later hours. Since there are so many great bars in the area, i'm not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"EaglesWest is the best fan club in the nation. The bar staff is great, always smiling and the addition of the kitchen is great! The additional staff has helped with the busy Sunday Eagles crowd. This is a great group of fans and a ton of fun."}
{"text":"I would think Rockbar would have live music every night of the week, thus ROCK. Nope."}
{"text":"Live band with an outdoor rooftop patio. Servers and bar tenders were extremely friendly and down to earth. Didn't get any food but because the service was great and the place was lively I give this bar 4 stars."}
{"text":"Tucked into Old Towne Scottsdale, near to a Philly Cheesesteak place, is a nice little place called Rockbar.   The name says it all. It is a place to go and have a few drinks and listen to some great music.    Lately, they have been featuring Hucklebuck, an awesome coverband, and the place always gets jumping when they are on stage!  The drinks are good and strong, and not badly priced.  No food is served, but they do allow you to order from the Philly Cheese steak place, thru their computer, and they will deliver it to you in there.  Gluten/Celiac note: No cider beers here unfortunately... must stick with the hard liquors."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink last night as this place looked pretty open and airy and we could watch some hockey and basketball on the TV's above the bar.  The bartender was nice, the $6 beer/ciders were a little pricey and I could tell this place would be much better when there was live music."}
{"text":"YEAH!!!!  I love the Rockbar!!   Great live music in downtown Scottsdale!!!  This is a must stop on my weekend. Bartenders have always been attentive when I'm there. For musicians, they have an incredible stage and sound system.  Live music lover.....this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Went here for an Eagles game with my buddy.....they are the Eagles headquarters for games. A great place to catch some live music. Typical atmosphere you would expect from a \"rock\" bar.....awesome smoking patio. Our waitress Cassie was amazing."}
{"text":"Hip and fun bar in Old Town Scottsdale.  The rooftop bar is perfect for cocktails outside under tall shade trees.  Live music is awesome, pool table is free and the service is great. Must go if you're looking for a fun spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere this is a Rock Bar without all the typical bs that comes along with a club of this nature. It's actually clean! We where very impressed with the sound the room was balanced nicely kudos to the sound engineers working last night. If something was off it was fixed soon after YES unlike most sound guys who set it and walk. The staff was attentive and friendly at least as much as they could be with a rock show happening. I only wish they served good food, at least normal bar fair would have been nice. My forty  dollar tab would have been closer to eighty. The bands where great top notch actually. Buried as Thieves, Co-op and Chaos Theory where really spectacular. Over all I would return without hesitation this place sets the mark really high for Rock bars."}
{"text":"Apparently this place blows on Sundays, even when the 49ers and the Giants are playing a semi final game. Such a shame because as you can see from the photos I took, the TV layout is pretty rad. There is also a rooftop patio with its own bar and again, many TV's available to watch games.  Rockbar does not have a kitchen but they do have a very limited menu that patrons can order off of from the Philadelphia Sandwhich Company that will be delivered to your table. There is also a \"gourmet\" hot dog stand directly in front of the enterance, that per the owner, offers all-beef hotdogs with 22 different toppings. Oh, also their drink specials blow at 6:45 on Sunday evening...$5 wells is what they have to offer. The service was great, but there were only four other patrons in the bar for the short stint we were there.  I'm going to give this place another try on a different night and I'd also like to see it as a music venue, my update review can (hopefully) only go up. At least the owners have their friends/employees, with 0-2 reviews each, writing five star reviews...good strategy, play on playa ;)"}
{"text":"Are you a fan of the Fighting Irish? Looking for a place to enjoy the Notre Dame games? Rockbar Inc. is the home base Notre Dame collage football bar in Oldtown Scottsdale, Arizona.

Don't just sit at home or your hotel room all by yourself while your  fellow comrades are having a great time cheering their beloved Fighting Irish to victory!"}
{"text":"AWFUL!! The place was empty and so was the bartender.  They ran out of wine.  On a holiday weekend in a tourist destination you run out of wine?  And the second choice...margarita...awful!!  Who will buy this place when it is out of business?  That is where it is headed"}
{"text":"Rockbar !!!   I actually loved this place other than the drink prices.  It's loud, It's grungy, It's Rock 'N' Roll !   They have a great stage right by the front door and bar; and, did I say it's loud?  It is, but sounds great.  The sound tech that was there that night was spot on and the band agreed with me.  If you like hard rock, you have to check this place out, it's fun!  Now, the prices on the other hand were a little ridiculous.  we were paying $8 for well drinks.  I expected this when I lived in Santa Monica, but not here in AZ.  Say it isn't so.  First $16 hamburgers (just like Cali) now $8 well drinks at the Rockbar???  Not cool, not cool at all!"}
{"text":"Great place to take your fiancé or a day on the town with the boys! Great atmosphere, awesome service & amazing location. You will for sure have a great time all while being in the heart of old town.WOW I sound like they paid me lol but I loved this place!"}
{"text":"I think I had a good time here. We were already a little tipsy when we got here, being drawn to the sound of live music.  I really can't complain about the $3 cover charge (it's Scottsdale after all) but it seemed like the band stopped just as we were settling in at the cool upstairs patio and they did not seem to play consistent sets from that point on.  In all fairness  the reasonably priced (and strong) vodka sodas may have affected my concept of time. The staff were friendly enough, the patrons not too terribly uppity and it was nice that the place was not packed and the aforementioned upstairs patio is a great vantage point to watch the hot messes on the street below. I'm sure it gets packed other times but I quiet enjoyed having my personal space and being able to chill."}
{"text":"Tuesday night.. Great local music In the Round! Haley/Jason/Shawn Amazing pizza by J. Barno"}
{"text":"Visited on July 4th with some friends. The place was dead when we went that afternoon. There were about 8 of us, and two others groups of 3-4 that came in at different times. There was one bartender, but we didn't have to wait for service at all. Drinks were cheap during happy hour and that was a nice surprise.  This place used to be Acme, and if you'd been to Acme the inside will still look pretty familiar except for the new stage that Rockbar added. Might be worth checking out when they have a live band, but otherwise nothing really makes this place stand out."}
{"text":"Only been here twice but every time treated with fast service and good hospitality. Small bar but good for a change"}
{"text":"A gem of a place in old town Scottsdale. Small very nice rock n roll bar...clean... neat with very good food. Great place to see a band but too small to accommodate for a very big name. Saw Mike Tramp acoustic there and it was the perfect setting."}
{"text":"Great bar! I haven't been when an Eagles aren't playing but bartenders are nice and fast. The fans make it, if you are from Philly or just an Eagles fan you need to go during game day!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a slow night but this place looks like it'd be a lot of fun when it's packed, live music plus the nice rooftop they have with nice seating and pool table, would def return"}
{"text":"Music was awesome! Drinks were overpriced enough that I gave this place a two. Maybe that's par for Scottsdale but I don't think 18 dollars for a captain and coke and a double red stag and coke is acceptable."}
{"text":"I havent been here since this was Acme.   Went here on Saturday night for a friend of a friends CD release. They utilize the alley between them and BS West as a patio. The downstairs seemed alright. Bar, booths, stage.   We decided to get away from the crowd and go upstairs.  Dear Scottsdale (ahem) ladies, If you plan to wear your stilettos and come here, do not go upstairs. Especially if you plan to driiiink. They are very steep and not very forgiving.  The patio was very nice. It provide the perfect acoustics for the band playing downstairs. There is a bar up here, though they seemed to be out of everything. The bartender was not very attentive, but also not very busy.  Im not entirely a fan, but Ive been worse places."}
{"text":"Went here for first time on Wed., 10/17/12 - great set-up and friendly service.  Lots of room to move about and booths/tables for different options.  Safe to assume the venue is \"pet friendly\" as there was a very large, but sweet bulldog bellied up to the bar taking in the scenary. :)  Music was great but way too loud. My friend (from out-of-town) and I were trying to catch up, but sometimes we couldn't understand each other - even when we were yelling. They may want to consider turning the volume down a notch.  Overall, good place!"}
{"text":"Always a blast, Very safe place.  Reasonable drink prices and great music in the heart of old town."}
{"text":"Good music, good times, great culture.  If you're looking for a place that separates itself from the club scene of old town this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We go to Rockbar for the EaglesWest fan club parties. The Rockbar staff is awesome! The bartenders are quick and are always there when you need them. Their food menu is really good. I recommend the pizzas! Everything is made fresh and comes out relatively quick. The drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here to watch some Final Four games.  It was a weekend mid afternoon and it was pretty dead so I'm not sure how this place gets at night at all.  We sat on the rooftop which had a great bar upstairs, seating area, a few large screens.  No food there, but that's fine.  The upstairs bartender was attentive and it was nice and mellow."}
{"text":"Had a great time last night rockin' with Signature band. That being said, this place will rip you off and laugh about it in your face...yes, Shea and your blonde cohort, I'm talking about YOU! Do not run a tab and always count your change. Drink prices escalated minute by minute as they huddled and snickered. Hope management gets this message. Not the first person to post about the theft going on here!"}
{"text":"Well I'm a Wildcat in a Sun Devil bar wearing all my gear because we were at Blitz across the street watching my tram getting their butts kicked!! My friends are all sun devils so in my anger I said let's leave Blitz and go watch ASU so I can at least see one AZ team win!  ASU lost..of course..but I still had a good time here.lol. I like the open feel of the bar when they open the garage style window by the bar. It made me feel like I was sitting outside even though I was inside. I love four peaks and nice to see they had Hopshot on tap. And the price was great.   Looks like they have a stage for music..when I was there there was a DJ. Anyways I would consider coming back if I find myself with some Sun Devil friends!"}
{"text":"Great Venue so much better than a completely indoor one. It gets way to hot and stuffy when you are completely inside. They have a hot dog stand at least when me and my hubby were there they did and it was great to have some munchie food. The bartenders know how to pour their drinks. They are expensive but we'll worth it. I'll happily go here again."}
{"text":"For years this has been THE place to watch Notre Dame and Philly Eagles. It's also always a good place to be for live music .... and ..... listen up because I'm going to tell you something that's hush hush.... they have the best (THE BEST) corndogs. It's not on the menu so it's super secret (but screw being silent...... spread out the word because everyone should know).   Stop by and see Shea, Lindsey and Nima behind the bar. It's refreshing to have a bar that is NOT your typical Scottsdale Bar (you know what I mean, aka no affliction shirts or pretentious d-bags)."}
{"text":"Ok so we went for a special event. Bought tickets ahead, showed up just after doors opened. went to a seat on patio, had good wings and several beers. Then found out show was not fo a hour and a half. So we waited, then found out they close off the patio during shows. No seating inside due to every booth reserved vip. Then a different act opened, we just walked. No idea what time the main would go on. Very small venue, not suited to live music at all. The two stars are for the wings and very hot bartender, did not get a name. Tall, short hair, and ice blue eyes."}
{"text":"If you are an Eagles fan, this place is a MUST! Great food and even you go alone everyone is so friendly you'll feel like you have been going there forever!!"}
{"text":"Shea was probably the best bartender I've had in Arizona drinks were on point food was great music was awesome come check this place out"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Scottsdale. They always have amazing local and national music. If live music isn't your thing, you can go upstairs with a nice view and relax on their spacious couches, play pool and enjoy the Scottsdale weather. Recommend this to all the snowbirds coming to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at this bar!! Nima gave our party great service and made sure our time there was impeccable. We appreciate the accommodating staff. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"We went here for the music, and discovered some pretty amazing food.  My wife and I wanted to check out the music here recently and didn't give much thought about the quality of the food--we just figured we'd nosh on something or other to fill our stomachs.  The pizza we ordered was surprisingly good--far better than I expected.  Didn't know that this was a full-fledged pizza joint that even delivers.  Great pizza, drinks, and music--sounds like another date night with the wife is coming soon. . ."}
{"text":"Fairly good venue for live music. Appears that there's usually enough parking along Craftsman's Court or 5th. It was good, varied crowd there to see local favorites Money Shot. The $5 cover wasn't excessive.  I'm pretty sure the drinks were watered-down, but the service came with a smile.  Note to owners and prospective attendees: I'm sure there are bouncers, and they need to keep an eye on what people are doing in the crowd. There was an altercation that could have been prevented. Ladies need to be ready to let the staff know when guys are getting too attitudinal."}
{"text":"With the right band I love this place - Saw Elvis Before Noon here on Saturday. I like upstairs which is usually more chill - especially when it's nice out. The upstairs bar, couches and pool table are not to be missed."}
{"text":"The look and feel of this place is amazing! you have yo check it out. With good prices on drinks and a hot, friendly staff how can you go wrong."}
{"text":"Every time I come in here it's very empty.  I think maybe it's just the wrong time or something.  I need to come in here not late at night.  Late at night it's dead."}
{"text":"Ah...Rockbar Rockbar.  You know your location is haunted right? Haunted with failures of the past!  I really hope things work out for you guys. Its a great location, and a great deck/patio.  SO me and a couple friends went there on a friday night. We decided Rockbar would be our first stop to try it out at 1030. Yes it was very dead inside, but still a little early?  The downstairs bar was very nice, the female bartender very friendly with no problems. But then upstairs...looking beyond the good decor, large bar, and nice deck, not as fun as it should be. The bartender Kevin? EXTREME lack of customer service. EVERY bar has the same damn drinks...its the atmosphere and customer service you need to stand you apart from the bar next door.  I hope that they get some training, or new employees to bring up the atmosphere and I am sure I will be back again (cuz its close to my friends work)"}
{"text":"DubROCK Wednesdays are my favorite night in Old Town Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of a regular there now so I may be a little biased but I like RockBar a lot. Cassie and Nima are great bartenders and there is just a fun and uplifting vibe there. I'm not a big fan of the bands that are brought in but watched a ton of football games there, played bean bags and just had a sweet time."}
{"text":"Rockbar.  I vaguely remembered it was the old Acme, but since I am not in Old Town much at all lately... I don't know how long ago it made the conversion to Rockbar.  There was a $3 cover charge for the few minutes while we were entering... The band was playing a version of Eleanor Rigby that rocked pretty hard so we agreed to pay the meager fee.  The band played two songs and then stopped.  They seemed to start up again as we were leaving... and I noticed the cover was no longer being collected.  Odd.  Anyway, the vodka/sodas we had were strong and served with a slice of lemon and lime.  I am not a big fan of vodka, so I appreciated the citrus.  I wish I could tell you how much they cost, but thanks to my Best Buddy Brian and Eric R, I didn't buy a drink at this place.  Thanks Guys!  I would come here again if a good band was playing.  The place was pretty empty for a Saturday night, though.  I don't know if this is a common thing, but I didn't care because I was in good company."}
{"text":"Our hostess/manager/valet/bar keep/was very attentive and enjoyable. Really turned our bad day around. Thank you!!!"}
