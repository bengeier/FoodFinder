{"text":"I tried Wafel Bar at the Christmas Market. The weather was cold but that didn't stop people from lining up for waffles and their hot beverages! Unlike the waffles I'm used to having, which are essentially made from pancake batter, this Li√®ge waffle is cooked from a hand-moulded dough! So you could expect a chewier and thicker texture."}
{"text":"Had a Wafel Bar waffle when I was last in Toronto visiting the Evergreen Brick Works Winter Village. Wafel Bar had their own little stall there, so I haven't tried the real truck, but close enough!   The waffle was a traditional Liege waffle (East Belgium) and had a light and fluffy inside, while having this nice crispy texture on the outside. I got the Go Bananas wafel which was topped with chocolate, bananas, and white chocolate chips. Delicious combination!   They had only a few other flavors, all of which were pretty expected, like the original, smores, and turtle waffles. I didn't see a single customer without a smile, even while eating their Wafel in the cold Canadian winter weather! I would try a different flavor next time, if I ever find this stall again!"}
{"text":"As I was walking through the Christmas Market, I saw a kid eating her waffle, I couldn't stop staring at the beautiful creation. I got in line, they took my order promptly. They have about 5-6 items on their menu. The wait to get your waffle depends, I had about 4-6 people ahead of me. It took me about 5 mins or so, felt longer since it was cold outside. I ended up getting the waffle bites with white chocolate fudge as my dipping sauce. It was to die for. I'm drooling at the thought of it."}
