{"text":"Oh. God. No. The only other table in the place was a crowd of vulgar drunks, which should have been my first warning. My margarita looked and tasted like Mt. Dew. Queso fundido was gross, but they tried. Is it so hard to carry Chihuahua cheese in a Mexican restaurant? In their defense, the menu clearly states that the cheese is Monterrey jack. The ground beef in the tacos smelled like canned dog food. My boyfriend said his rice and beans tasted old and flavorless. $40 later and we wished we would have just went to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I was driving on the brookpark road when i see the sign out side of my favorite mexican restaurant that close 3 years ago i can't belive is going to open again this place is only for the good mexican food lovers i can't wait to drink a margarita. = ]  They will open this year."}
{"text":"One of the few traditional Mexican restaurans I have had a chance to visit...love the ambience and most of the time it is quite empty...but the food and services are pretty nice..."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided it was time to try this place.  Plus, I have been on a Mex food bender so why stop now?  Lively environment... Music, bright colors, you get it.  Friendly service.  Big menu with all the usual suspects.  Tri-colored chips arrived at the table( hello red, green and yellow chips) and a mild chunky salsa.  Salsa tastes similar to Cozumel actually.  I opted for the standard stuff I usually get to fairly evaluate a Mex place... Bean burrito, cheese enchilada, and a side of mole sauce.  The mole sauce was definitely not homemade and it tasted off actually.  The bean burrito was sitting in a slightly watery sauce.., weird.  Beans were very standard.  Rice was very dry and looked old which freaked me out.  The cheese enchilada was covered in a pedestrian cheddar type cheese.  The food did not taste good at all.  Skip it and head to Si Se√±or, Villa y Zapata or Cozumel instead for good Mex."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Cleveland area. Give you some really nice size portions as well, but the taste was really great. Service isn't the best in the world however, but if you can put up with that, the food is really worth it, just don't expect much from their wait staff."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here because we had a Restaurant.com certificate.  It was dinner hour on a Saturday night and the place looked like a ghost town.  That should have been a warning sign.  The young, female server was abrupt, unfriendly, and unprofessional.  The portions were large, I will say that, but the food had such little flavor.  I've never had such bland Mexican food.  I'm used to the delicious food at Don Ramon.  We would never return to Mexican Village, coupon or not."}
{"text":"I was so unhappy! My waitress was very nice. However, the food was awful! I ordered two shredded beef burritos, they came with rice and beans. The rice was just over cooked yellow rice, the beans were gray, and my burrito was awful. First thought was that it was very wet, then I took a bite and thought, \"what sadistic person puts celery, lettuce, and tomato in a burrito?!\" That was definitely not in the description on the menu, otherwise I would've asked them to omit it. I feel like it was their way of cheaping out, instead of meat I got a bunch of veggies. Needless to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is nearly always great here.  We have loved everything we've had.  Owners are really nice and have recommended we try certain items and have enjoyed those meals.  The shrimp diabla is fantastic.    Regarding some of the comments of other reviewers about the service, there is room for some improvement there.  Waitstaff is always friendly, but seem to frequently forget drink refills or tortillas that should come with some meals.  To me, not a real big deal, we just ask when we want something.  We will keep Mexican Village on our staples list."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I would have tried Mexican Village had it not been for the fact that they are one of the few restaurants near Parma that takes restaurant.com gift certificates. I had some free credit and so decided to give this place a go despite relatively poor success with most other Mexican places in the CLE area.   Mexican Village is located on Brookpark in an area that is fairly easy to overlook or pass by. I had seen it before while passing in my car but wrote it off as it looks kind of skuzzy and divey from the outside. Other reviews had suggested that it was wise to overlook the exterior and that the food was a winner here.  We arrived just after 5 pm to find a ghost town. We were literally the only customers in a relatively large restaurant at dinner time on a Friday. I've learned in the past that this is not always a tell-tale sign of a bad food joint, especially since Bac (one of our fav restaurants) was this way the first time we went.  My first judgement of a Mexican restaurant is always on the free chips and salsa. Here they are pretty good. Perhaps the salsa is a bit runny and mild but the flavor was good and they were quick to bring more when we were out. Our server was friendly but her English was fairly poor (not really a negative factor to me) and she wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. It was a minor flaw and didn't affect my rating much.  In general I can overlook just about everything else at a restaurant if the food is amazing. Unfortunately it was just okay. Fairly bland and uninspired. My wife didn't like her meal at all and my Chile Relleno was just mediocre. I'd never had a Relleno that was wrapped in a tortilla rather than battered but I would have been okay with it had the flavor been great. There just wasn't much taste to it at all.   For a mediocre Mexican restaurant I felt that the prices were a bit high. Other Mexican places in the area aren't great either but are a bit cheaper so they're easier to justify. Had it not been for the discounted price due to my gift certificate I may have been upset by my final tally. We left full and didn't get sick from the food but I don't think we'll return."}
{"text":"Don't know how long they've been reopened but they're nothing like the original Mexican Village.  Decided to try them again as my last visit (just after they changed hands and just before they closed) was terrible.  Well, they aren't as good as the original but not as bad as the last Mexican Village owners.    Well, the chips weren't fresh and the salsa was bland, not much of anything in it except a few tiny pieces of tomato and wilted cilantro.  The beans were nicely seasoned and the rice wasn't bad either.  The Chile Rellenos was very good, the poblano pepper wasn't mushy or slimy and the cheese was perfectly melted.   The lighting was harsh.  There was no ambiance, in fact it was completely mood-less, no Mexican music or music of any kind playing in the background (as much as I hate Christmas music that would have been something).    Service could have been a little more attentive but I hope that will come with time.  I might give them another chance in a month or two after they've been open a while to allow them time to work out all the kinks (I hope)."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and couldn't have been any happier about my chimichanga.  Juicy shredded beef in the fried tortilla and your standard rice and beans."}
{"text":"I just started working in Independence and am looking for places to eat lunch. My friend and I were down in Valley View and tried to locate Cozumel. We ended up going straight instead of turning and somehow ended up driving by Mexican Village Restaurant. Life is weird. You miss a turn and end up finding something down the road. Mexican Village was a tropical oasis on a cold March afternoon. The service was great and their was some good music playing in the background. Only one other guest was there on this day and that bummed me out. All of the office workers in Independence seem to flock to Cozumel. They should go to Mexican Village. They have a mariachi band on Fridays according to a sign that I saw there."}
{"text":"Back to my old stomping grounds in Old Brooklyn.  This is your typical mexican restaurant.  Que the bright colors, the mexican wait staff, the latin music, the salsa and warm tortilla chips, and the margarita's.  The chips were warm and the salsa was OK with good kick to it. I started with the Village Margarita, a little sweet for my taste, but the tequila was just fine.  I had the tamale, taco, and enchilada with shredded beef. Add rice and beans.  The food was fine but it didn't jump out as extraordinary for mexican.  They are definitely above average.  Teh service was above average but again not in the top 5% of the other mexican places I've been to.  Portions were big so I had to ask for a to go box.  I would come here again if I'm in the area."}
