{"text":"Good raw food, fast service, clean location. I would of like to get little more salmon instead of rice for a large bottle that will cost you 20$ with something to drink"}
{"text":"Yum! Healthy and very clean. Good place to relax & have a drink. It's very hip & cool."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. I'm vegan so their smoothie, smoothie bowl, and grain bowls are great options. The service? Terrible. Some of the employees need a serious attitude check and management needs to reconsider who they've hired as staff. 

I go here a lot. Some staff are so friendly, make conversation, and get to know you.  Today I went in, this blonde girl was working cash. She was rude and barley paid attention to me when I was ordering. She forgot to send the payment to the terminal and began gossiping with a coworker. I politely told her it didn't go through and she completely ignored me. Finally got her attention, she rudely said thanks. I walk away. 

I'm then waiting for my food. I look over and even though there's customers, she's crouched down behind the cash on her phone. Sat there for a good few minutes before she stood back up and walked away from the cash, leaving the other coworker to do all the work."}
{"text":"Weird customer service, or shall I say lack of.
Went to the Yorkville location. 
I've had the smoothie bowls, smoothies and coffee, all were pretty good save for the \"Proud\" bowl as it had lots of ice filler. 
Also had a rice based bowl with chicken which was unremarkable but sufficient.
The reason I won't go back anymore is because they have strange personalities.
They have 'dairy' (milk), coconut and almond milk, but don't have cream available for the coffee which is standard everywhere. Nor do they have cinnamon..(fine, but still) anyhow I asked on different occasions with different staff members if they could suggest to management to have cream as I drink a lot of coffee and would go more often if they supplied cream; they froze like robots and ignored me. When I persisted they looked stressed and fluffed me off with a 'yeah okay' type of mumble. The normal thing to do would be to say \"sure I'll pass your suggestion on\"
Even when I say good things they freaked out like when I first discovered the place and said \"wow what a great concept, I like this place\" the server just ignored my comment and said \"have you decided on your order\" all she bloody well had to say was \"thanks glad you like it!\"
The owners must be cult-like freaks, who are more consumed with marketing then actually connecting with their customers.
There isn't even a reachable phone number to offer constructive feedback with a human. 
I politely wrote to their contact form a while back with my cream suggestion and received zero response. 
The food is alright and the price is on the high side, nothing to write home about.
They have so many staff working at once but move at a snails pace and save for one or two friendly staff are behave like stepford hipsters. 
Someone else on Yelp made a comment about the manager changing the garbage right next to customers while they were eating, I didn't see that but find it to be very bad practice, another example of poor customer experience.
I'll really wanted to like it, but will go to Freshii and Starbucks across the street instead."}
{"text":"The service is SO SLOW. Like it took 25 minutes to get a salad bowl together and into my hands. There were 7 customers and probably about 12 staff, so busyness was not the issue. 

The food is good, but make sure you A) have time and B) make sure they get your order right. They forgot two ingredients off of my bowl. And when it cost $16, there's only 7 ingredients and it takes so long, you really start to care!!!"}
{"text":"Got a creative bowl with sushi rice based, topped with cucumber, curry cauliflower, kimchi, wakame & tofu and spicy shoyu for sauce.

There are variety of toppings to choose from, the creative bowl was delicious and definitely would go for it again. They also provide free top-up to make my bowl prettier. However, I haven't gotten to try out their grain bowls and smoothies bowls.

The atmosphere is cosy and quiet, they have long tables and benches which suitable for studying. One con is the service, I was having trouble selecting the combination of the toppings, yet the people weren't helpful at all :("}
{"text":"Portion was god awful. Especially for the hefty price. You're better off going to another poke place in town. The smaller of the two sizes was TINY and they don't even fill it up. They leave 1/4 of the bowl to be filled with things like furikake and wasabi beans......that is not acceptable. I paid $13/$14 so you can at least fill the tiny bowl. Furikake is meant to be a GARNISH. Not 1/4 of my bowl. Very not impressed.

Only reason I gave 2 star instead of 1 was that the food was decent......"}
{"text":"I specifically came here for their signature poke bowls (which is only available after 11 am) and I was told by the staff that the Hopeful Poke Bowl is a popular item, so I ordered that. It's made with black rice, and is stacked with salmon, avocado, sweet unions, jalapeños, tomatoes, pickled ginger, wakame and sriracha aioli. The ingredients blended really well together, it was flavourful and fresh, and I enjoyed my meal to the very last bite. 

I also had the chance to try the Adventurous Poke Bowl, which is made with white rice and kimchi as one of their ingredients. However, by comparison, it it wasn't as flavourful and it reminded me of a regular kimchi fried rice that you'd order at Korean restaurants, so I wasn't a huge fan of that. 

Their feel good beach theme and welcoming staff are amongst the other reasons that I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"\"You have to pay for for hot sauce.\"
\"Sorry for the fifteen minute wait, we can't open the tin of black beans.\"
\"No you can't have a refund.\"

Garbage."}
{"text":"I ordered a large make your own bowl. Although they offered good choices for toppings, I was disappointed by the portion size of the salmon. I specifically ordered two cups of salmon but what I got in my bowl was equivalent to one serving at other poke bowl places. I was also very disappointed by the sushi rice. They cooked it with too much water and it was very mushy. The rice just stuck together in a soggy blob and stuck to the bottom of the bowl and was very hard to mix with the toppings. It was so mushy that you could barely make out the individual grains because it mushed together. I went on a recommendation from a colleague but was very disappointed. Definitely not worth the $16!"}
{"text":"Slowest service I have ever experienced. I was there after rush with only two people ahead of me and it took 20 minutes to get a basic bowl. Never again going to spend $17 on an overpriced salad just to stand in line and watch employees chat in front of me."}
{"text":"Love Calii Love -my new craving for lunch. Love the create-your-own poke bowls. I have yet to try the smoothie bowls too."}
{"text":"I've had poke bowls and smoothies here and both are fine, albeit slightly overpriced. 

The service is very slow - expect to wait at least 20-25 minutes even if just ordering a smoothie. Lots of online orders which slow things down incredibly. The wait is made worse by the fact that it is unbearably warm inside."}
{"text":"Ordered a smoothie and waited for more than 15 minutes for it to be prepared. There were 2 people in line before me (one waiting on a poke bowl, one waiting on a smoothie), so it wasn't as though they were slammed with orders. I have NO idea why dumping fruit into a blender is a lengthy process? In addition, the smoothie was not even remotely cold. Made me feel like I was drinking something that was regurgitated. I threw it out after 2 sips. 
Save your money and take an extra 5 mins to walk to a better spot like Fresh or Kupfert & Kim for smoothies closeby."}
{"text":"Simple tasty friendly 
A friend and I went to grab some of there acai bowls because of Instagram. When we arrived the girl at the counter was really friendly helping us through the menu. I picked the loved bowl, my friend picked a poke bowl hopeful the most poplar one. Both of our dishes were really tasty we will be back soon"}
{"text":"I live across the street and have dropped by twice, and they nailed it both times! 1st meal: salmon with tuna on quinoa, wakame salad and Sriracha aioli. 2nd meal: same poke but all salmon. The fish was marinated perfectly, every ingredient was fresh, I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Yummy tasty food that feels good in your mouth when you eat it.

I enjoyed it throughly!"}
{"text":"Stingy portions. I asked for extra seaweed and was told they couldn't put anymore because \"seaweed is their most expensive ingredient.\" Food is bland and over priced. Portions are tiny. I've tried their food 5-6 but I vowed I'd never come back here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! The people, decor, the food! I've had a great experience every time I visit Cali love. The staff were very friendly, the food is delicious! I love the decor and the music. I always recommend this place to people looking for poke in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place used to be good when it first opened (which wasn't that long ago!) but now the portions are just out of sync. A regular size bowl- was 3 massive scoops of rice and a measly scoop of the fish...not worth the $17 price tag for basically a huge bowl of rice. 

North poke in Kensington is much tastier and not stingy like this place. Pass!"}
{"text":"Small portion sizes left me still hungry, even after ordering the regular (which was overpriced in my opinion).   Lack of ingredients and flavour in the bowl has me super disappointed.  The quinoa could use some flavour and the topping portions were incredibly small.   Pokito on Queen is miles better.  Won't be returning to Cali anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sauce needs improvement. I chose the Confident, and the sauce was just so overwhelming it covered up the taste of the fish and other toppings. Was it pure hoisin sauce? So salty. Why not just marinate the fish? I appreciated the generous amount of tuna and other toppings over sushi rice. The rice however - couldn't tell if there was any vinegar in there (did someone forget to season it?) and it was packed so tightly in the bowl. They seemed pretty newly opened and the place was busy on the Tuesday 1 pm when I arrived. I'd go back if they made improvements..."}
{"text":"The biggest waste of money ever. Paid $20 for a kale salad with some seeds and a tiny piece of salmon (was the size of the head of my fork). Wasn't very tasty (but hey, it was kale). As soon as I walked in I knew I was a sucker. Place is nicely decorated and going for a cool/in-style vibe and charge an arm and a leg for it. They wrote my order on a giant placemat. So gimmicky here. Will not go back."}
{"text":"T-two stars? That's pretty harsh haha. I don't think it's quite deserving of this terrible reputation, so hopefully this review bumps it up slightly!

I was wandering around First Canadian Place today looking for a meal, and the relative peace of this place caught my eye. I also remembered seeing the name on social media a while ago and decided to hop on the trend about a year late. The store was organized quite nicely, with a clear ordering counter, menus in prominent sight, sufficient waiting space, and even a few seats by the side. Strangely, I rather enjoyed the service and atmosphere here! The girl taking my order was extraordinarily patient (if a little disinterested) in describing the menu and all the ingredients I asked about, pointing out all the ways I could customize my bowl and so on. The staff preparing the food were efficient and friendly, also taking the time to explain the garnishes and sauces and ensuring that everything was presented well. In addition, I actually liked the somewhat unique way they've branded the restaurant and how the person at the counter called out that each customer was \"feeling powerful/excited/grateful\" - kinda cute, just like the place itself.

The poke bowl I got was definitely delicious and filling. Fresh, flavourful, but not overpowering (I've found that some of the other poke places marinate the ingredients way too much to the point where I feel like I end up almost drinking the dressings). And the variety of ingredients and sauces to choose from is far wider than I'm used to - kelp noodles? Watermelon radish? Spiralized beetroot? Rice pearls? Yuzu kosho mayo???

The one thing (and unfortunately it is a big thing) that is very negative is the price - probably the main reason for these poor reviews. Given the portion size and the fact that it is nonetheless in a food court ambience, the price point is just way too high for repeated visits, especially with the influx of other poke spots all around. It's too bad though - it was so much fun being called \"creative\", which in my job I have not heard for a very, very long time lol."}
{"text":"Show some Calii Love!
I wandered in here before Barre class to grab a poke bowl.

The adventure bowl was the perfect amount of food.
I asked for zucchini noodles instead of rice and the salmon was fresh.
I had a bottle of mate as a drink, they have charcoal lemonade too that I wanted to try.

The smoothie bowls looked delicious.
Perfect meal for next time I'm headed to a gym glass!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice, the atmosphere was comfortable and good for grabbing food or studying, etc. The decor and design is so so cute and on point, it actually gives a cali vibe! Overall was greattt!"}
{"text":"A tiny poke
A douche manager
A blatant design

People call me Tabasco and I'll call this establishment Gravy Bandwagon.

FOOD:
I get you are on King St. West harbouring a ridiculously high rent for your 4,345 sq. ft but please do me a favour and start poke-ing that tuna thicker, we will thank you immediately and bring you customers.

SERVICE:
Sir manager, you are a douche depository, totally the opposite of what Hawaiian people are. What's wrong with these gringos, they visit a foreign country and come back thinking they got the secret sauce.

DECOR:
The design is conventional, needs more soul and refined materials, feels cheap. 

FAMOUS LAST WORDS:
Exploit the fad to the max. 

Truly tuyo,


Tomasso Tabasco"}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was friendly. My boyfriend and I tried the hopeful and grateful, we enjoyed both. They were both delicious, however a bit pricey for a not so filling lunch."}
{"text":"Warning: IF YOU'RE NOT INTO SQUISHY, GELATINOUS RAW FISH THAT'S NOT WRAPPED IN RICE, THIS IS NOT YOUR SPOT. Otherwise, your kid could make this: kewpie mayo on sushi rice with squishy raw trout bits and wasabi crunch peas and a couple flecks of edamame for $10.95. I can't say I've had an extremely positive experience with food here, or I guess I'm just not a poke bowl person. The trout came out was lukewarm though not fishy. I'm just not fond of it not surrounded by rice in a sushi and the addition of wasabi peas made for a strange combination of soft and crunchy mouth feel. It just didn't sit right with me with mayo added. The rice was lukewarm too and that's strange for a salad bowl. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Was excited that Calii love paired up with Ritual for a promo and that's what brought me in to the store. I wanted to customize my bowl and they wouldn't allow me to make the modifications even though it was the afternoon and it wasn't busy, which was really unimpressive. 

Granted it was a lot of modifications, but it made more sense than to customize since they charge you $2 more if you're going to have salmon in your poké bowl when you build your own instead of using the menu option..."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for an early afternoon pick-me-up while adventuring around Toronto. The place has a super trendy vibe. Very spacious, and decorated with bright colors. I was totally feeling it!

At 12:30 pm on a Tuesday, it was packed with a pretty lengthy wait. After skimming through the menu, I decided on the superfood \"Good\" smoothie which came with banana, blackberry, wild blueberries, coconut milk, and chia seeds. It took about 12-15 minutes to place and receive my order. 

My smoothie was alright. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about either. The best part about it was that it was a healthy, guilt-free food decision! I totally needed that after the binge eating I had been doing on my trip! 

At only $8 and 300 calories, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a low calorie, vegan, gluten free option. Not as calorie concerned? No dietary restrictions? No worries! They offer poke bowls and salads, too!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I came here last year, the energy was high, the food was great and I left with a smile on my face! But the last few times I visited, the employees genuinely seem tired and overworked, resulting in lesser quality/unsatisfying bowls."}

Poor service 
And how many more time can you rebrand a salad in a bowl with a plastic fork
Another meh! On my list"}
{"text":"If you are having a bad day, week, month, year, go to this restaurant!! They make you feel at home and special, plus the food is amazing. The staff makes you feel special and are very accommodating. Will definitely be back here. Smoothies are great, poke bowls are good. A great place to study or hang out."}
{"text":"Calii Love, sounds promising in a newly developing margin of restaurants emerging in the Toronto scene serving up fresh healthy smoothies, and poke bowls. I was surely disappointed by my visit.

I order two smoothies both on the green side (One was called Revived and the other Immortal).  We ordered and patiently waited for our smoothies to be made. WOW- was I in a time warp?! I watched the guy make the smoothies in super slow motion it must have been at least 15-20 minutes. I can nearly describe every move, slowly cutting the banana, peeling each side back from the flesh.  Glancing at the recipe 1,2,3,4, 5... ok. I've lost count now,  carefully measure each piece of kale....my golly it was so darn slow! We were the only people ordering too! 

Pretty pathetic TBH to have staff that slow, I understand the smoothies we ordered were relatively new to the menu but at least move with a bit of a spring in your step!  On top of that he left a couple times to get whichever ingredients he needed from the storage room. It just seems like a lack of training and food prep to me.  

On another note, the smoothies weren't balanced well at least flavour wise.  Revived was overly sour and Immortal needed some sweetness. I know, these are green smoothies meant to be healthy but there are tricks to make them a bit tastier/refreshing (Some apple, other neutral sweet fruit perhaps?).

We saw the other girl working make a poke bowl and it looked a bit skimpy.  A bowl full of rice toped with an ice cream scoop of tuna topped with an ever so light touch of onions, greens and other toppings, you'd think they were rationing for an apocalypse.  On top of that she asked the customer if she wanted fresh sprouts (which the customer said yes) and proceeded to snip 3 single shoots from the huge bunch growing on the side table."}
{"text":"Trendy foods unite at this hip new restaurant. Portions are small but satisfy a light meal. $10 Acai bowl was only average, but the atmosphere was nice. Hope for improvements as new restaurant kinks are worked out. Staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"This place opened not too long ago, and there's still great hype surrounding it. I came here to pick up lunch to go, and found a massive lineup in front of the store. The line passed quite quickly though; I think it took roughly 15 min to place and pick up my order.

I decided to make my own poke bowl, and chose the large size (equivalent to their normal size bowls). My base was half Calii noodles (a mix of zucchini with kelp), half arugula. I got a scoop of salmon (their tuna looked disgustingly stringy and choppy) along with the following sides: kimchi, wakame x2 (don't judge, I love my seaweed salad), roasted beets, and Asian pears. To be honest, I was really disappointed to see that they have me so few pieces of pears. With regards to toppings, I got the roasted seaweed along with the sesame seeds and furikake... However, I found that they gave an overwhelming amount of furikake.

Overall, I just didn't find the toppings to be worth the premium price charged for the poke bowl. The portions were also smaller than expected, particularly since I'm paying so much for the protein/poke. Probably will not come again, unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Insanely expensive $$$ for super mediocre poke.

So disappointing after coming from LA; for one small one scoop bowl and one w/ two scoops, I paid nearly $40!! Definitely used to paying max $12 for a 3 scoop bowl, never mind a tiny one scoop bowl. Very small sauce and topping selection. No corn, mango, or even crispy onions either I was shocked that's like the best part of a poke bowl! 

Cute spot with so much potential, but prices are just far too high for what you get."}
{"text":"I tried this place once for their poke bowl and another for their coffee. 

Maybe I haven't tried any other place yet for poke bowls, but I thought it was pretty good. There were a large number of ingredients to choose from, the quality was decent and the service was satisfactory. The price is a little above average for a poke bowl however.

In regards to their coffee, it was not sour and was robust in terms of flavour profile."}
{"text":"The place is cute and the menu looks great. But the smoothies took forever to make and as I was waiting I watched the guy working the cash go to the smoothie section... dip his fingers in the strawberries and eat some then head back to the cash. Super disgusting... especially since I got a strawberry smoothie. Definitely not worth the price. Do not go here if you value food safety!"}
{"text":"New place opened up last year and been meaning to go for awhile but not really being one for food trends or poke in general it took me awhile to get off my ass and go.

Inside it is very light and spacious, some communal style benches and small tables before reaching the main counter at the end.

Not sure if this particular food trend is supposed to be hipster orientated but i got those vibes from this place and from the name of the dishes on the menu. Half expected the guy behind the counter to walk around with a guitar in hemp sandals and socks. 

I order the hopeful, it was not the best portion or the best poke i have tried and after munching it down in typical \"not a foodie just hungry\" style I was not exactly impressed."}
{"text":"20min for a smoothie?

I can handle a $20 bill for two smoothies, but not for that long of a wait.

+ The address on Yelp is incorrect."}
{"text":"I couldn't stop coming back for the poke and smoothies during my work trip to Toronto. They do everything right and it's so gosh darn cute in there"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would. I live in LA and this place lives up to its name. Most amazing poke place in Toronto, they know what they are doing when it comes to poke. They are friendly and accommodating with great customer service. If you are searching for poke in Toronto, don't even bother searching elsewhere. I promise you that you won't be disappointed. Order the hopeful bowl, it is my favorite. Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"So delicious! I made my own bowl, ingredients were fresh and love that they have two sizes for the bowls. Really friendly staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a Hopeful poké bowl - the salmon was sub-par, a little mushy and fishy. 

Had a smoothie acai bowl - the acai smoothie blend was a bit icy.

Cute atmosphere, trying to be very \"L.A.\" , but not the best place if you want to eat a really good poké bowl or a really good acai bowl."}
{"text":"When I came in, the decor was great. Then it all went down hill from there. Their acai bowls were subpar quality with random chunks, which I did not appreciate. My date ordered poke bowl. given my Toronto experience with poke, I didn't have high expectations. but out of all the poke places that have opened, this was by far the worst experience. Putting aside the price, it wasn't even edible. It was really fishy. I felt bad for my date and told her I would take her somewhere else. 

Yeah, word of advice. Don't take someone in a date here lol"}
{"text":"I got the Dreamy Smoothie Bowl, which is described as a \"Blend of blue majik, banana, pineapple, avocado with TOPPINGS - Blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, coconut flakes, cacao nibs.\" Overall I had really high hopes for this place because everyone talks about it so much, but I honestly realized after that I can make better smoothie bowls in my Vitamix at home. For over $10 for a smoothie bowl, I'm expecting a high quality meal substitute. This smoothie bowl, however, was a small portion size and basically just tasted like blended up banana that is overpriced because of the blue color. I didn't taste any pineapple in the smoothie! The cacao nibs became a little too bitter tasting at one point, especially mixed with the banana. 

Overall, I wouldn't go here again despite the aesthetic interior and Instagrammable items. Just not worth my money when Toronto has so many other great places for healthy food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Got an acai bowl twice from this place and have mixed reviews. The first time it was good but the portions are super small especially for the price and the second time the bananas used as toppings weren't even ripe, the blueberries were sour and there was an even smaller portion size this time. Pretty disappointing and the value for money isn't there.

FYI - asked and protein powder is from bulk barn."}
{"text":"Walked in and the guy at the counter turned to me and said \"I don't know how to serve you\", then walked away. Waited 5 minutes for someone else to come take my order. Weird experience. Okay acai bowls."}
{"text":"This place is great! 

I got the festive bowl... subbed in tortilla ships to cucumber tho. They will sub in different foods in your bowl or you can create and customize your own! Part of what makes this place so great. 

They also have complimentary water infused with cucumber and raspberries. 

Their meals are pretty healthy and delicious. Was fairly filling for me. 

The bowls were prepped super quick, there weren't too many people in line however, so it went super quick. 

They also jot down your name on the order which is neat! You'll know right away which bowl is yours or if staff want to ask you what toppings you want, they can just call out your name while you wait. 

I would definitely come back and try some of their deserts!!

Love the beach vibe and decor in this place as well. It actually really does remind me of California and the food there! 

The food isn't the cheapest, but no places with healthy options will be... 

I'll give a 5/5 for Calii love! 


UPDATE
Finally got around to trying the acai /smoothie bowls. They are Delicious! Portion is fairly good."}
{"text":"Poke Bowls became popular since last year.  Calii Loves is one of the cafe bars which serves up poke bowls and other different healthy items like salad bowls, smoothies, cold-pressed juice and coffee.  Calii Love presents the Hawaii and Californian style food which emphasize on healthy, organic and gluten-free ingredients.  They offer many signature dishes of poke bowls and salad bowls.  You can also build your own bowls as your wish.  It may take a while to decide though because they have many choices.  First of all, you have to choose your own base like Black rice or Kale.  Then, you will choose what kind of protein, toppings and sauce you prefer. In the end, you can top up with whatever they offer on the counter such as Sesame seed, Chili flakes, Nori (seaweed), Pea Shoot sprouts, Wasabi Peas and Furikake. Or you can get a little bit of everything!  

FOOD (3.5/5)
We picked easy ways by getting signature bowls though lol. We got EXCITED Poke Bowl and PASSIONATE Salad Bowl. 
Excited is based on Black rice and Salsom sashimi.  It tends to be sour because of the Kimchi which I wish they can make less sour kimchi. 
Passionate is based on Arugula and Quinoa.  It also comes with slices of Roasted Chicken.  This dish is good for people who prefer meat over seafood. 
Both bowls were quite good.  I ordered the large size of the Excited bowl, and it came pretty big.  It was bigger than I expected.  I would recommend getting the regular (SM) size of bowls.  I will be a perfect amount.  

AMBIANCE (4/5)
The place is very spacious, bright and comfortable.  It's a good spot for studying, working on your laptop.  Its perfect for chit-chat and can accommodate for big groups.  

PRICE (3/5) $$ 
It's quite pricey than other places in my opinion.  However, their portions were generous.  I got lots of salmon on my bowls!  They were fresh and tasty as well.

SERVICE (3/5)
They were nice, but they spoke very quietly.  I couldn't hear them well when they talked to me. Or my ears were not good enough lol. I wish they will speak louder and explain about their products more next time.  It will be very helpful for customers like me lol. 

OVERALL (3.5/5)
Calii Love is very close to my place. I had a good evening, and my tummy was full and happy.  I will come back to create my bowls and get a coffee sometime.  I heard that they also have fancy latte designed by Barista Brian too.  I went there in the evening, so I didn't have a chance to get one.  I think he comes to this location at specific times (before 3 pm.).  You guys can check the time on his IG @baristabrian.  Good Luck!"}

{"text":"Ordered on ubereats around 920 pm, they close at 10 so just after i put in my ord it showed they were closed. Sweet! 
Made it in the nick of time :)
That being said, it was like they were trying to punish me for making a last order before they closed at 10 or something because the amount of onions in my poke bowl was unbelievable! I started laughing! Either the person who made it LOOOVVVVESSSS onions or they were seriously pissed at me. Raw onions are s garnish ppl. NOT a damn meal! So gross"}
{"text":"I had one of their poke bowls...it was okay, nothing mind blowing. For me, the key to a good poke bowl is the combination of textures and flavours...a little bit of crunchy, crispy, creamy, salty, sweet, umami etc. I love the nice touch just before serving the bowls where they cut some microgreens and put some seeds, nori, crunchy peas."}
{"text":"So the atmosphere is really nice, the menu looks appetizing, and the girl at the cashier was super helpful. That's what go then the 2 stars. I ordered the renewed smoothie and it was terrible! It was completely sour. No matcha, didn't taste the coconut. It literally tasted like celery and lemon juice.  The girl said it was very earthy because of the matcha. Mine did not have any matcha in it and if I didn't have an appointment, I would have gone back to make them fix it. There were only 2 orders ahead of me and the smoothie took forever to make. While I was watching them make the smoothie, I noticed it took 2 of them to make it and they ran out of coconut milk. They kept grabbing different cans and kept running out. It did not look like they added enough into my smoothie and I heard them yell out \"86 coconut water\" it's 1130am, how can you be out of coconut water? Also the girl behind me even complained about the last time she was there and how they made her smoothie completely wrong. I definitely do not recommended. It feels a little like cafe gratitude in LA but the smoothie was terrible."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick, healthier dinner tonight. This place is right next to the airbnb I'm staying at this week. Pretty good. I \"felt creative\" and with tuna over vege noodles with an assortment of sides. I had their team select sauces for me."}
{"text":"Went with my bestfriend & both of us made our own bowl. 

I got the sweet potato & zucchini noodles (which are raw) with avocado, mushrooms, edamame & black beans with chipotle cashew sauce & an egg. 

It was good. But honestly nothing that special, the instagram hype is why I went 

The decode and atmosphere is amazing but the food was very blasé. 

it's whatever."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a girlfriend and ordered the Hopeful poké bowl. This was my first time at this restaurant, but I've had poké before. My bowl was just alright. Nothing outstanding and the size of the bowl for the price was not good value. I will continue my search for my go-to poké in T-dot."}
{"text":"Mahalo. Highly instagramable; this place doesn't always deliver but has improved since opening. 

The Service:

Friendly, \"good vibes only,\"  but seems like too many hands in the pot. The whole process used to be painfully slow but has improved. The wait time for an acai bowl is still 10-15 minutes.  Staff, at times, don't appear very confident as per what goes into each bowl. No, i'm not feeling charged or loved at times. 

The Product:

I had no expectations that this acai bowl would taste like the real thing I had in Brazil; however, I expected it to somewhat be edible. The first acai bowl I had here was absolutely horrible. The frozen packets were not blended properly and there were chunks of ice in my bowl. They have improved a lot since and I enjoy a bowl occasionally; however, I found out that I could buy the sambazon acai packets at the health food store and make these bowls at home. 

*They offer bone broth in the winter months."}
{"text":"Went to the location in the path and got the \"Grateful\" poke bowl by accident as it was vegan. I wanted something with Tuna. The small is $11.95 and it is was ice cold and portion was tiny. They literally grabbed it out of the fridge. You get a small portion of some white noodles, a few edamame, a few pcs of diakon, tofu and a scoop of avacodo. It was sad that are willing to charge almost $12 before tax for something that with very little value.
Calli needs to reevaluate this item. 

I have had the Hopeful which was satisfying."}
{"text":"I love poke and Cali Love does a great job. I had the Hopeful bowl, black rice, salmon poke, avocado, ginger and more. Delicious! Large bowl? Better be hungry since the black rice is filling. 
Challenge can be the line up and who's in front of you since there's so much on the menu to review. They almost need a reading line up and someone dedicated to pointing you in the right direction of choice. 
Love what they do and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the renewed smoothie. $12... Went straight into the garbage after the first sip."}
{"text":"Do Canadians think Hawaii and Southern California are the same? The decor was a little confused.

Small portions, my order got messed up, sauces were so-so."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place but I'll take it out of my list now. The food is good here but surprisingly high price with small portion. I had a big bowl of steamed rice with very few toppings 
No service but ask for tips at the very beginning, I feel so confused."}
{"text":"Not only are the poke bowls delicious, but the customer service is excellent. I ordered on uber eats and my order was wrong. I called the next day and the manager was very understanding and offered to replace my order the next time I came in. This will definitely be my go-to poke place."}
{"text":"Delicious and nutritious! I had the vibrate salad and my company had the passionate salad. We both were impressed with the taste and freshness. 
The only issue (which brought it to 4 stars) was the service to order was slow. 
Would still go back tho!"}
{"text":"Store caught my eye from the store wall art of the wings where numerous ppl take pics at. Poke bowls were nothing special - have had much better and higher quality poke bowls out there for the same price. Acai bowls are stunning in regards to appeal - but once again nothing out of the ordinary. Wouldn't really revisit again.."}
{"text":"We got a cardamom chocolate here and it was the worst hot chocolate we have ever tried. It didn't have any chocolate taste. It just tasted like watery cardamom...Maybe better to list this on the menu as cardamom tea?"}
{"text":"Calii Love has a bright atmosphere that shoots out ray of positivity. There's quite a few seats but may be filled quickly during busy times. 

We got the Loved acai bowl and it was yummy although the drizzle of honey on top was a little bit heavy handed. It's definitely a great breakfast that is a healthy choice!

Hopeful poke bowl consisted of black rice as the base and salmon as the protein. The salmon was fresh but it was a small portion in the bowl. The black rice gives it a different texture than other poke bowls which was not bad - different though. The overall flavours is good. It is more on the spicy side for me with the jalapenos and sriracha aioli. The poke bowl is a smaller portion than other poke places with a relatively similar price.

Overall it is a good place for healthy alternatives and friendly service. I'd skip the poke bowl and try it somewhere else. It is on the pricey side but their smoothies and acai bowls are worth a try"}
{"text":"I should have listened at the other reviews for this place. I got the Hopeful Signature Poke Bowl and it was very bland, and didn't quite sit right in my stomach. Maybe too much sauce? It is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice. It's too bad, because I love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place. 2 stars for the nice interior."}
{"text":"Over priced hipster BS. 

Salads were dry and boring. The smoothies were so bad I thought it was a practical joke. 

This was the first meal I've had in my life that felt like a punishment. 

Also the staff are insanely rude. The managers couldn't care less about your experience. 

For the love of god if you are in this area go anywhere else in Yorkville."}
{"text":"I've been twice so far, every time it's busy, everyone looks like they are eating something delicious but everything I have ordered is underwhelming :(. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong thing?

I'll keep still give it another try

The inside is casual and nicely decorated. Staff are always friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I love Cali Love. 
I've been here a few times and I loved my Poke bowl each and every time. 
The fish is always fresh, and I thought the ingredients in my bowl are always balanced. 

My favourite is the hopeful - the wildrice gives it a nutty flavour, which I really like. 
The staff has always been polite, and the space is generally very clean."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a friend because we wanted to eat a healthy meal. The interior of the place is gorgeous and very chic, it gives off a hawaiin vibe! (The door mate says 'Aloha' and the entrance is surrounded by vibrant green plants, it compliments the rest of the restaurant well).

Anyways, I decided to go for the their signature poke bowls. I got the small HUMBLE bowl ($11.95) which included: tuna, wakame (seaweed), shoyu (japanese soy sauce), sweet onion, wasabi aioli on white rice. I was able to substitute different ingredients, so instead of the tuna, I asked for salmon and got rid of the wasabi aioli. 

As for the bowl itself... HUMBLE: Was very disappointed. They gave out SO much rice it was actually ridiculous, and the protein portioning was so tiny. It probably was less than half a cup. I was expecting way more. I totally forgot that I hated seaweed so I gave that to my friend and in the end my bowl was very basic (onions, salmon, white rice, and shoyu). As for the flavour itself, there was nothing special. The only positive feedback I can give is that it's gluten free. 

If you're an individual who eats very clean, I would say this place would meet your dietary needs. Personally, would I come back again? Definitely not for the pokebowl, perhaps for their smoothie bowl. (This place is definitely on the pricier side too so I highly recommend taking your cash somewhere else). In addition, I did find it very unique how the cashier placed my order. When I placed it they announced it by saying \"Anna is feeling -insert name of the dish-, so I was feeling humble\"."}
{"text":"Ever since trying my first Poke Bowl I've been looking for a go-to place in Toronto. Calii Love is extremely bright and welcoming, they have a pretty wide variety of toppings, and they serve things other than Poke Bowls (for those who aren't 100% interested in the trend just yet).

Although I never tried one of their smoothies, my coworkers say they're unreal. 

However, aesthetic and smoothies can only take a Poke place so far. The first couple times I came to Calii the portions were relatively large and the toppings were unlimited. Unfortunately, in my most recent trips the portions seemed to have taken a big dip and the toppings are now very portioned. I get it - it's a new business and you have to manage inventory.

My issue is however, the management. The few times I've gone to Calii the management was publicly reprimanding their staff. 

While it's important to coach your staff and train your new employees (especially for a new business), it's simply bad practice to do this in the middle of the restaurant, during busy hours, and in front of customers.

Hopefully this will change over time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since the design was cute and it looked beautiful inside however they are WAY overpriced for what you get. I ordered through ritual and got the Amazing salmon bowl - thank god it was 50% off coz I couldn't imagine paying full price (around $15) for a SMALL poke bowl. 

It had way too much jalapeños and not enough salmon, half the bowl was jalapeños... I do have to admit the black rice was interesting - I didn't think I would like it but it actually had an interesting sticky texture and not dry. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the poke bowl however since it's Eats Week I do want to give their breakfast bowls a try - maybe those are better?"}
{"text":"Aloha Calii Love, as much as I love poke, I do think there's room for improvement. 

After speaking with a friendly staff, I found out the restaurant has been open for 2 weeks and has yet to host a grand opening. With that being said, I anticipate the store will continue to iron out operational details and improve going forward. 

I ordered the Hopeful poke bowl, and not liking pickled ginger, was given the option to substitute it with another topping. You also get to choose a type of grain, be it brown rice, black rice or quinoa. This was topped with 1-inch cubed raw salmon, scoop of avocado (and other toppings I can't remember off the top of my head) and drizzled with spicy aioli. The variety of toppings available was pretty nice. However, this Hopeful bowl (Regular size) was a whomping $13.95 + tax. Although the portion was quite generous, the price is a bit steep. 

Overall, the flavour was a bit lacking - my expectation was built from tasting poke in Maui which was exploding with flavours. Here, the raw salmon was not marinated and served plain, which I assume the owners hoped the sauce would help jazz up the flavours. Unfortunately, that was not the case. 

All in all, a hopeful place with room to succeed (especially in an area of yuppies!) I do hope to see improvement and hope to come again to see the friendly faces of Calii Love. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"I ordered Tuna Poke and it was just alright. When I order poke, I was thinking of a clean and healthy selection, but it came with so much mayo, and rice. There were too much rice compare to the amount of Tuna. The raw onions on the side did not mix well with poke. Also you get the seaweed on the side and it taste the same as the one from Costco. I don't think it worth $15 meal."}
{"text":"Wayyyyy overpriced.  My small bowl ($15) contained more than 3/4 rice, topped with four little pieces of chicken (for $5), and hardly any of the four \"free\" toppings.  I feel so ripped off.  And a tip? For rude and unhelpful service? Nope.  I'm always a great tipper, but not when I'm made to feel like an inconvenience. Great concept. Great tastes. Not great value."}
{"text":"Finally a couple poke spots open near our house! Love poke from Hawaii and LA so was very happy when two different poke spots opened up nearby. Calii Love is great tasting, good size portions, and lots of toppings. Would definitely recommend and will probably hit them up weekly. Now if there could be a real legit sushi burrito spot around here..."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here. The food looked good. I got a large Hopeful poke bowl. I was sooo hangry, I dove right into the meal. I was extremely disappointed. There was no balance in the bowl at all. It was like eating a pasty, slimy, flavourless nothing. I think I only continued to eat it because I paid $18+ and I was starving.

To improve the taste, I feel it needs more acidity to balance the over zealous amount of oleogustus ingredients. Also adding some crunchy bits to offset the mushy. And to be clear, I added kimchi to my bowl to maybe balance it - but it wasn't enough. It needed more. 

Overall, hugely disappointing for the taste, texture, cost, and hype."}
{"text":"Hands down the best poke in the city, so delicious! The staff care about feed back and they're approachable. Customer service and attention are taken into account from the start. Love that this shop is in Toronto, great location. I will be stopping by here frequently. The food is amazing! Made with a lot of care and attention. I see a lot of talent, hard work have been put into creating this place. I can only hope to see good things :)"}
{"text":"Passed by this place a few times on the streetcar, always intrigued by their summery feel and cute decor. Having just gotten back from Cali, Colombia (although I know that these 2 things have absolutely nothing to do with each other), the name just spoke to me - I have to try this place out...and soon!

Definitely cute decor. Right down to the washrooms. The place is clean and bright with cute/cheesy sayings - depending on how you look at it - plastered up against the walls. It was about 9 o'clock on a Thursday night - pretty steady looking with a person or 2 occupying most of the tables. Although we took a while deciding what we wanted (everything sounded heavenly), we were able to order right away. The girl behind the counter even had a second to explain a bit of the menu to us after having asked if it was our first visit. Deciding on the confident and the divine, my boyfriend and I placed our $40 (eek!) order and took our seats patiently waiting while it was being prepared. 

This is where my dear Cali Love loses a solid star. We get called up to the counter, not once, but twice, to let us know they are out of a different ingredient each time. The first was an easy switch - so easy that I don't even remember what was missing, just that the girl offered edammame in place of it and I was fine with it. And the second was a little more devastating - pomegranate which, oddly enough, was the deciding factor in me choosing this particular one over another I was drooling over back when I was making my choices. Which would have been an appropriate time to know about these missing ingredients. However, given the situation, the staff were pretty accommodating and we did receive an extra topping for 1 of the bowls. 

The bowls were pretty good. Just not $16 good. Visually appealing, flavorful, fresh, healthy and I just love the extra crunch the toppings at the end added to both dishes. We had to go up and ask for some sort of extra sauce for one of the bowls as we found it to be lacking and a bit dry but the girl made the perfect suggestion and voila, heavenly it was. The piece of salmon on the grain bowl was TINY and although both my guy and I were completely stuffed after sharing the two large-size bowls, I found myself wishing through certain bites that there was more salmon to pleasantly accompany the other flavors. Either way, I'd be back and I'm not about to say I wouldn't order a dish with salmon on it again.... The blessing in disguise of my dear Cali Love is that these are all fresh ingredients you can easily find here in T.O. and if you love to cook like I do, you can eat about 5 different variations of your favorite bowl directly out of your own kitchen for probably half the price! Amen.

Overall, this place is definitely on the health food kick and fits into your \"new year, new me\" 2018 mantra. Hurry though, you never know how long the smoothie bowl craze will be 'in' for.

Oh, and it was damn wasabi they were out of. (Perhaps, the very thing my bowl was lacking)."}
{"text":"Uber Eaters beware! Ordered two poke bowls for lunch. My boyfriend got the Humble and it was literally just a clump of mushy rice with heaps of raw white onion, some fish and a little nori. No sauce at all and it just reeked of fish. We both tried a bite and were scared of getting sick so we just threw out everything. Uber refunded our order, but we were still left hungry. Definitely won't order from Calii Love again."}
{"text":"We left empty handed and frustrated tonight after paying for two iced coffees. We asked three times for 'one black and one with milk'. We watched as two were made with milk. After reminding them twice \"no milk in the second one\" we waiting for 15 minutes as a number of customers behind us came and went with their orders. When another iced coffee was served to us with milk, we left without a refund. I see no reason to ever return here."}
{"text":"So amazing best poke bowls and açaí bowls around! And it's really awesome that you can get both at the same spot!! Sizes are pretty good and worth the money! A must hit if you're in Toronto. The names of each menu item are also really unique and I love the whole theme of positivity and health consciousness that cali love stands for!"}
{"text":"After walking past Calii Love, I wanted to give it a try and expected lots of love. However, I was not blown away by the poke bowl.  It was pricier than other places that I have been to and the bowl itself was bland.  I tried the quinoa with salmon and a bunch of toppings including the avocado.

The location is a bit out of the way from the downtown financial district but the space is large to fit more people. There were people sitting down two rows of tables similar to communal style. Although I like trying new things, I regretted coming and giving this place a try especially that it was a 10 - 15 min walk from the office. I should have looked up reviews before heading out on the adventure.

They definitely need to change the pricing as well as the flavour of the food.  I doubt I will be returning to give it a try again."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. The hopeful bowl is my go to menu item. That black rice is delicious and adds something different to the mix. I also like the fresh sprouts grown in house. Bowls range from 10-15 dollars."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Small size is too small. Regular size is too expensive. Mixed feelings about this place because I think it's too pricey yet I've liked everything so far. I would definitely go more frequently if the prices were more reasonable. I don't want to pay $17 (taxes included) for a lunch that will satisfy me, yet I really love this stuff = occasional treat."}
{"text":"Meh. Won't go back. Very over priced for what it was. I ordered an \"Amazing\" poke bowl and it was far from amazing. Found it lacked a lot of flavor. The black rice, which sounded exciting, was a lot to process and had a earthy bland flavor. For almost $17 dollars I felt it wasn't the most generous portion of salmon. Underwhelming food experience but the staff were very friendly and it was a nice place to meet some friends for a bite."}
{"text":"The restaurant looked small on the outside, but it is actually quite spacious once you walk in. The decor is very aesthetic which is perfect for people seeking for places to take pictures. 

They have a variety of acai and poke bowls. The names for each bowl are all positive words such as loved, hopeful, dreamy, etc. So when they ask for your name they will say \" (name) is feeling loved and hopeful\" which I thought was very cute and brings a positive vibe.

We ordered the loved acai bowl and the hopeful poke bowl. We thought their was a little too much honey for the acai bowl you have to mix it really well or all you will taste is honey. The fruits tasted very fresh and all the ingredients blended really well together. As for the hopeful bowl, we enjoyed tasting it because there was a lot of different spicy flavours coming from the jalapeño peppers, ginger, and the salmon itself which is different from other poke places."}
{"text":"Yum! Excellent grateful bowl and chicken bowls here. I docked them one star because it smells like my garbage disposal when you walk in here. This is not so appetizing..however, the food is fresh and delicious!

The grateful bowl had a nice helping of what they call sweet potato noodles - don't confuse these with yam noodles (these are actual noodles) as these are sweet potatoes and zucchini squash that have been cut up to serve as noodles (they are still raw vegetables). I had the tofu on my bowl and the dressing on the side. The bowl was so full of flavorful veggies and things that you hardly needed to add any dressing. For $14CAD this was a pricey bowl, but it was exactly what I needed after a long day of flying and feeling unhealthy!

You will certainly feel like you had a meal that was good for you after you eat here!"}
{"text":"Of all of the many poke places that I've tried since they've started popping up like flowers in the spring, Calii Love is the one that feels like the first dandelion growing on your lawn. It appears as a cute flower when you first see it, but turns out to be a weed. 

It's a clean looking establishment with all the looks that us Yelp-ing hipsters love. That simple aesthetic and allure of healthy food was enough to pull me in. I've had many poke bowls before so I knew exactly what I wanted here. However, unlike most of the others, Calii actually had good seating space! Thank goodness. 

I ordered a bowl, happily sat down, and dug in. And what I found was... disappointment. It lacked all the things that I loved about poke.

 Poke is an adventure in the mouth. Experiencing those different textures and flavours. The delicious, soft salmon, the fresh crunch of all the veggies, and the added flavours of various toppings. 

Calii's poke just felt flat on all of those fronts. Maybe you could call it a whitewashed poke. Or as if someone played broken telephone, describing a poke bowl. They have the looks of their contemporaries but not the flavour. 

Perhaps I'm being too harsh due to my disappointment. I expected Calii to be the end of my restless search of the perfect lunch spot. Now that I'm really thinking about it, it wasn't as terrible as I put it out to be. Just very disappointing. Overall a 2.5/5."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because of the store itself it so cute with the bright teal outside and the tiled aloha on the floor of the entrance, very Insta-worthy. But the inside once you are away from the windows is actually quite dark. I've been here twice and both times it was soooo disappointing! 

The first time I got a build your own poke bowl and it came up to $15. I got the black rice on its on its good but the rice was so hot that when they put the raw fish on top it  cooked my salmon!  Everything end up being weirdly half warm and badly cooked from the heat of the rice. But the portion was ok and i was full after. 

I also got the renewed smoothie. Oh boy the girl who made it looked like she didn't really know what she was doing and I was already worried. Supposedly with matcha but there is 0 matcha flavor. It literally tastes like someone juiced some celery and mixed it with lemon juice, it was so sour. The kind of sour that burns when it goes down, makes my eyes close, and i have to prep myself for every sip because it was an expensive smoothie and I can't throw it out It was watery at the bottom and chunky on top. It was terrible for $10! I told the girl that it was really sour and she gave me an \"I don't care\" look.

Overall I would not be returning as there are many other better poke places and WAY better smoothies else where."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend to try it out. Portions were good and the place looked rather clean. Staff were really nice and helpful too. We ordered the hopeful poke bowl which was good. I just thought they would have more fish in there than what I got. Majority was rice and vegetables. Over all I'd come here again but if there was another poke place around I'd probably give that a shot instead."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Full disclosure, I went for breakfast and then went back for lunch. The obsession is real. 

I started my day with the Proud bowl for breakfast. My friend got the Loved. Both were delicious. The staff told me that Loved was the most popular bowl, but the Proud did not have any sort of avocado taste to it. I also love raspberries, so I loved the taste and the tartness. 

When I returned, Saturday morning brunch rush was in full effect. The managers/owners were there watching every order go out and ensuring the team was well focused and coordinated. Truly impressed with that personal involvement and hands-on approach. 

I got the Humble poké bowl and added avocado. I ordered it through the Ritual app and the order was delayed so one of the owners personally apologized and gave me a free drink while I waited. 

Great experience overall. Highly recommend and I'll be back when I'm next in town!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my most favourite poke / smoothie place is town. The vibe is so relaxing, the music is so chill- it's pretty much like experiencing \"california's love\" in your mouth. My favourite poke was the grateful, the best black rice in town and the fish is fresh. What I like most about this place is the fact that there are dairy free option which is bliss for me as a lactose intolerant soul.. also... check out the wings on that baby! What a delightful treat for instagramming!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst smoothie I've ever tasted in my life was here. It was called immortal and I was a little skeptical about the garlic and cucumber so I asked for less, I was still willing to try. But they said that it can't be altered since it's powdered and the liquid amount etc etc. So I ordered it anyway and oh my gosh.. It tasted ONLY like cucumber and powdered garlic!!! It tasted like dish water gone wrong. Made me feel nauseous and sick and had to throw it out immediately. The store itself is cute but there were little fruit flies flying all over the sauces for the poké bowl. Side note, a customer ordered couple of poké bowls and the fish looked terribly old and thawed out.. would not trust it for my life! I will not be returning. Maybe for the açai bowl next time but highly unlikely."}
{"text":"Having breakfast here. I've chosen \"love smoothie bowl\" very tasty and healthy and an americano. This smoothie bowl is a little bit cold for me, I don't recommend to have a hot coffee with this one. You can try other veggie and fruit smoothies. I will come here again for tasting the rest of the menu if you look for a healthy meal i can recommend this place
PS: wifi connection is not good. It's not convenient for working with your laptop"}
{"text":"Servers were not welcoming and did not help us new customers so my friend and I did not get the good vibes we were expecting (passive-aggressiveness ain't cute). Oh and we weren't there at a busy time and we're polite/respectful people with good vibes so it's sad our vibes were not reciprocated. Store decor/ambience was good, food quality is decent but definitely over-priced. I'll give them credit for having dairy alternatives, vegan options and overall aesthetic. Great for photos but there's tons of other nice places in the city that are good for pictures with even better service/vibes. You can get more for your buck at other establishments. Will not be going back to this place in a hurry."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this is good. Cali vibe - chill staff. The Loved Bowl is just what I was expecting and the coffee is delicious. Definitely a go to spot for a healthy breakfast and a great way to kick off your day!"}
{"text":"Super cute and vibrant aesthetic, fits with every girl's Instagram theme. 

I got my usual acai bowl with granola, pecans, bananas, strawberries, blueberries, and coconut shreddings. The size of the bowl is enough to fill you up after just a couple of bites. It is a superfood - which is a pick me up that contains a lot of healthy fats, vitamins, and antioxidants. Although, I wouldn't eat this all the time. It can be quite filling. It is super delicious, and the location is convenient to stop by and enjoy a healthy treat.

*A photoshoot outside where the angel wings are painted is necessary*"}
{"text":"i've been here a couple times, once ordered Poke, the other, Acai bowl. 

Acai bowl was okay...even though it is over priced for the amount of Acai.

But....Poke bowl was terrible I have to say. 
Ive been to Hawaii like 7,8 times and I love Poke there. 
I understand that it is inland here so we can't get as fresh seafood as they can. 

But....the bed of rice is terrible...I am sure you don't know how rice should be cooked,
nor Poke cant have Teriyaki sauce over it.....

Amount of fish.....4,5 pieces of salmon or tuna....

I am not sure if they have had Poke in Hawaii but I think they should go online and
find better recipe than that.  

Good luck to Calii Love!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love the look of the store and the location.  King west close to Mirvish means they will get a constantly supply of foot traffic.  Their store is bright, beautiful and happy too.   It's super instagramable.   

I've only tried their poke bowls,  and while it photographed well, they were average. 

During Toronto poke week I could get a bowl (their small bowl) for only $5 (instead of $10) .  Since we had a few more people, we got a large bowl as well but that set us back $16.95 before taxes.   

The portions were very small in both bowls.  The contents were fresh, but with so much spicy mayo or aioli in it...how could I even tell?   

This place gets points for location and decor ....I like how they serve more then just poke, they have lattes and smoothie bowls too.   The staff are pretty friendly as well, but I can't give them any points when it comes to their Poke.  There or several poke joints within minutes of walking distance (Su & Bu for instance) that make way better poke bowls, at much lower prices, with bigger portions."}
{"text":"I always order a Loved smoothie bowl using the Ritual app and it's always ready when I arrive and the staff is always friendly. The staff can Sometimes seem a little distracted by just chatting with each other, but I understand the temptation to just shoot the shit with coworkers when it's slow. My only feedback is maybe getting them to learn to pause conversations when customers are waiting, but not the end of the world. My smoothie bowl is always delicious, and I also Love the hats the staff wear, I think if they were available for purchase they'd be popular!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wanted to like this place because it serves other items other than poke. I remember being so excited and anticipated the opening for so long. I've been here a total of 3 times since it opened and I haven't been super impressed. I've ordered the smoothie bowl and they're decent if you're looking for a snack or breakfast. The acai bowl was what disappointed me the most, I was craving acai bowls since my trip to Maui. I found that it was too watery and not blended properly, I didn't mind the toppings. I just remember the bowls in Hawaii were so delicious and refreshing, and this one was not. 

I ordered a small hopeful poke bowl - it costs around $12. I remember it tasted kind of bland for a spicy salmon. As for the rice, I've had black rice before, but it's usually mixed with another type to make it softer. My jaw was so tired from chewing the rice that I couldn't really appreciate the flavours - perhaps why I thought it was bland. 

The stars really go towards the friendly staff and lovely interior. It's a really cute place, but if I want poke I usually go to other places in the area."}
{"text":"[3.5/5] Aloha, what is up with the Poke trend in the city, dude? 

Whereas many of the shops popping up are small and can only handle a takeout crowd, Calii Love on King Street has the privilege of having spacious eat-in seating, illustrated with sunny decor decisions that clearly speaks to the crowd of young jet-set Instagram-obsessed lifestyle-conscious condo-dwelling yuppies that will be reeled in to this kind of place.

And what a place, dude--feels like I just stepped into an airy west coast Venice Beach-meets-Maui new-age health nut cult or something. Their products (poke and smoothies) are all given such energized optimistic adjectives like \"Joyful,\" \"Charged\" and \"Confident,\" and if you're feeling creative, then, you get to make your own bowl, you creative punk. Clearly they got health-conscious mindset going with their fishy branding strategy, but they are the only poke place thus far that I know of that also serves coffee.

Because I was Feeling Hopeful, I had to suffer through a smattering of marinated salmon, black rice, avocado, and spices delivered in many ways. It was actually pretty uppity spicy and delicious, kinda had me curious about Feeling Adventurous has to offer. At $15 for the regular sized bowl though (for all their menu items), local poke fans might be Feeling Pinched. As long as I'm Feeling Obese from a full meal though, I'm satisfied.

Calii Love's head chef spent time working in Hawaii before deciding to bring this taste of Hawaii to Toronto, which would lend this shop a vibe of authenticity in a food trend scene where most other places in town are doing \"lazy man's sushi burritos\" (Rolltation, I'm looking at you). I'm no poke connoisseur, but if you want to surf on over here for a try, it's at least worth a try and a few I-was-here selfies.

{"text":"I believe they opened up last year, they also sent out office free coffee...so my coworker and I went to check it out...I was quite surprised since there is competition in the nearby area, they were quite packed with lines during noon-ish/lunch time....nearby there is SU&BU with Poke Bowl(s) and also if you go to Spadina and Adelaide, there is Kim & Kupfert...so having been to  all of them. I feel like Calii Love is very similar to Kim but they have a better presentation in terms of the containers and etc...

The small portion is quite small but if you are not a big eater, if could fill you...at the end of the  line, you can choose from wasabi peas, sprouts and etc..to add to your custom bowl...

All in all, a place to revisit when I feel like splurging...LOL"}
{"text":"I was excited for this place to open; they didn't have the information listed on their website, so I called the other location (on King) only to find out that they have already been in business for a couple of weeks... and they open until 10pm!!!. That's a bonus for me because it is hard to find a healthy choice when you're working late into the night.

The entrance is cute; you are greeted with ALOHA as you walk in, mini plants giving the place a vibrant, fresh environment. There are California elements, including wood countertops, mini surfboard, and wall coverings to match.

The menu has a lot of options, so there is something for everyone, but I'm not going to lie when I tell you that this place can be pricy. I think poke / salad bowls are the \"IN\" thing, so you're looking to pay anywhere from $12 - 16, depending on what you want. It is worth it to some, not all... but once it a while, I think everyone deserves a treat.

I opted for the Blessed Bowl before heading back to work on a Friday night. It came with a large bed of quinoa (super filling, but wish I had more kale instead), kale on top of that, 2 poached eggs, curried cauliflower, sweet potato, scoop of avocado, curried cashews, and dressing on the side. 

As an added touch, you can opt to have toppings to end off your salad; nori, wasabi peas, sesame seeds, chili flakes, and freshly grown microgreens - SO CUTE!

I know reviews below said their Blessed Bowl was dry; but mine was good. Do I wish the poached eggs were less cooked, yes, but when they have been sitting, I understand that they won't be as runny.

I can't wait to come back :D"}
{"text":"I feel like this place is trying too hard. Too hipster. Too trendy. Too expensive. Too small. Portions of their bowls are WAY too small for their price point. With so many poke restaurants popping up, not sure how they will last. Other than that, the decor is nice for a place to work and chill."}
{"text":"I like Poke bowls and interesting fresh healthy food, so gave this a try.  If you want to try it, I'd suggest going soon, as I don't see it surviving, unfortunately.  But I hope it does.  Pretty cool place, very clean and fresh.  The issues:  small size is too small, large is too large- need something in the middle- lunch size, which is the principal business!  Given the menu is somewhat \"out there\" and unusual (which I like), they could help customers more, but don't.  They are quite passive and aloof.  So, what the heck, I ordered the Inspired.  It's not cheap- more than $18 without tip.  And the register's screen boldly suggested that I tip- 15%, 20% or 25%!  For takeout.  That was a bit offensive to me, and I tip everybody!  But particularly given I can get essentially the same meal at Kupfert/Kim or IQ for much less, and no request/almost demand (that's how it felt to me) for a tip.  When the person brought the bowl to the window (wait time was longer than IQ, but still ok), I could not hear her amidst the music and noise.  She asked if I wanted something on top, but I could not hear her, and had no idea what she was going to add (suggestion- put something up that shows what the available ingredients are).  So I passed.  Nothing wrong with the food- it's nice enough, with good flavours and taste. Too much rice. The value was not there, in my view.  So I'll sadly go back to my usual places."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by this place before it opened up because it said \"Poke Bar\" and I thought it had something to do with Pokemon Go. I had never heard of Poke Bowls before.

They're across the street from where I work, so one day when it was pouring rain outside it was the closest thing for lunch without getting drenched. The menu seemed great and it didn't take long for me to walk out with an order -- the fruit smoothie tasted fine, but oh the Poke.

The rice was clumpy and overcooked. The ingredients lightly sprinkled on top were bland and few. I thought maybe I had made a mistake getting the rice, but my friend said her quinoa was nothing to write home about either. The whole meal tasted like pre-made teriyaki I would get at Metro for half the price. Maybe I just didn't understand Poke?

Then I had a Poke Bowl elsewhere -- and it changed my life. I then realized that Poke is actually super-amazing, and Calli Love just wasn't cutting it. I've not been back based on some of the other experiences friends have had, but by the sounds of it this isn't the Poke Stop you're looking for."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I was incredibly excited to try this place. I've seen this place on my Instagram a couple of times and I had very high expectations. 

The aesthetics were certainly on point and very Instagrammable; I found it slightly amusing that the staff were all wearing crewnecks bearing trendy 'Millennial' catchphrases. I was also impressed by the fresh microgreen sprouts they snip for you and the array of toppings you can add to your bowl at the end.

However, I was sorely disappointed upon receiving my Blessed bowl.  For starters, my bowl was incredibly dry. I think they forgot to put dressing in my bowl. I would have asked for more dressing but sadly, I took this bowl to go.

More importantly though, I found dirt on my kale! Completely disgusting. I will attach a photo. 
Also, the 'poached eggs' were really just an undercooked hard-boiled egg. If you can't do a proper poached egg, please don't call it that. 

Final note, the female employee who hands out the orders at the end of the production (and snips your sprouts) was line was INCREDIBLY rude to another customer ahead of me. When said customer approached the counter to pick up her bowl (she really wasn't that late, honestly), the female employee said in the most reproachful manner 'I called your name several times,' to which the customer meekly responded that she must have just missed her name being called. Poor girl.

Anyways, based on my incredibly negative first experience, I don't think I'll be returning. This place is just all hype.."}
{"text":"I came here early in the morning, although more people came in for lunch time and the place became quite packed.

I got the \"Loved\" acai bowl and an Americano for breakfast. It was quite tasty although fairly expensive, and did not keep me full for too long. However, this place does have a nice atmosphere and the staff are quite friendly. The order was also prepared fairly quickly, and it started getting quite packed by lunch time."}
{"text":"I ordered the Signature Excited poke bowl. The poke bowl itself was good, but the portion was a little small considering the price of the bowl. There was also less fish in the bowl than other poke shops around the city. Moreover, the flavour was quite spicy for something that was advertised as only mildly spicy. 

When I asked to top up my bowl with some wasabi peas, the guy only added about four peas. However, when I asked if I could have a bit more, he dumped quite a lot on there.

I ordered my poke through the Ritual app, and the shop was also a little slow to prepare the food. However, the decor of the place is nice and clean. I'd likely opt to go to other poke places around the city next time I want poke, simply because I feel as though I get more value (and more fish!) at other shops."}
{"text":"The smoothie bowls are great. Not a big fan of the poke menu, but everything else is usually amazing"}
{"text":"This was the first poke place I ever went to and its the reason why I am ADDICTED to poke now. The food is fresh, colourful, delicious and fun. I love how they have set combos and also an option to create your own. Aside from the food, the decor is adorable and super trendy and funky. I love bringing people here because they always seem to enjoy themselves!
Aside from poke, they have smoothie bowls too which is heavenly as well. I shared one with my friend once and we practically inhaled it. 
I'm giving this place a 4 star only because I do find it a little pricey."}
{"text":"Definitely clean and health food but I would say it is pricey as well. I ordered smoothie bowl - Fabulous. I do love it !"}
{"text":"Just had a lunch here - not super impressed with the service, and the food was okay.

My friend and I purchased 3 meals, and the cashier took our payment but forgot to have the other staff make the meals. We waited through a flurry of ritual orders for about 20 minutes, and then followed up with the same staff member who took our payment and she was shocked that she had forgotten.

She had the orders made, which still took about 10 minutes (despite no other orders and 3 other staff members behind the counter). The food was a 3/5 but the experience really detracted from it.

Also, this is such a whiny point, but they were out of napkins on top of everything else. And it wasn't busy with patrons, just with a few ritual orders.

Not sure i'll go back."}
{"text":"Best Poké bowls in the GTA. That's all."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Calii Love, a little tweaks could make this a really great place! 

I had the Passionate bowl which I thought was really good - it had lots of chicken in it and they filled it with lots of veggies which was really great. They even ask if you'd like light, medium or heavy on the sauce which is a nice touch. I must say, the portions are pretty small especially considering it was $18 after tax. Some of the bowls my friends ordered were even smaller than mine, so that was a bit disappointing, especially considering Freshii is across the road with a really similar (and bigger) type of bowl. My friend had one of the smoothies and said it was the worst one she's ever had in her life, so I would error on the side of caution in that department. 

The overall experience in the store was ok - nothing life changing. They only annoying thing is that there is no signage in the store, so you have to go up and grab a menu before you order which can be a bit of a struggle during the lunch hour rush. Everyone ends up standing around not knowing what to do. The staff were nice, but took a while to take my order because nobody was at the cash desk despite there being a big line, no big deal though. 

I would like to give Calii Love another try, if they increased their portions and created a better ordering process, I know this place could be even better than it already is."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. The food is freshly prepare right in front of you and it's delicious. The place is spacious and pretty, plenty of seats. I came here alone and sat by the window watching people passing by and it was lovely. It looks like they have a second floor where they run some sort of fitness class (there was a group of ladies in their workout outfit before me). I had the Creative bowl, which is a build your own one.  The staff were really nice and helpful on picking the right ingredient to go in my bowl. Everything was great and I am coming back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Had heard tons of good things about them so gave their poké bowl a try today. Went over at lunch time and it was super busy - took me at least 20 min to order and get my order. The vibe was definitely nice though. 

I got the small \"hopeful\" bowl with salmon, avocado and some veggie toppings on a bed of red rice. The portion side was good, but the flavours were a bit confusing to me - wasn't like a traditional poké and did not have that spicy tangy touch to it. Also the salmon was a bit bland - wasn't marinated in soy sauce. I would say I've had better! 

For ~$15 (tax and tip in), I would definitely have expected a bit better in terms of the flavours going well together. I look forward to trying their smoothies next time! 

Nov, 2017: Update 

Gave them another shot and tried their \"Excited\" bowl and was still not impressed. There is something about their poké that they're not doing right! I wonder what! I guess I'll stick to their smoothies and latte's next time!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place. Good service. Albiet the amount of food you get depends solely on who is serving you. The one for us was quite miserly. For $38 the food I got was barely more than a small cup poke bowl. I had the spinach base while the second was rice base. It was 80% rice with sprinkling of food on top. I saw other servers being consideraly more generous. 

Barely any chicken, a spoon of avocado, spoon of Pineapple salsa, jalapenos, spinach, sauce. $18. There were a couple of other ingredients I'd added, I forgot which ones. I don't mind paying $20 for a poke bowl. At least the amount should be good enough to feel a little full. This was frugal. Not bad taste wise. But frugal. An no cream / reg milk. for the coffee. Only 3.2% milk, coconut and almond milk."}
{"text":"Decent poke, bad value...

This is probably the most instagramable poke you can get in Toronto but it's definitely not the best. 

PRICE
I got a small adventurous poke bowl and large hopeful bowl. The total came out to almost $40 so to me it's not worth it, considering how small the small actually is... also doesn't help that they aren't too generous with the salmon. The default tip was 15% (even for takeout which is what I did) which I think is kind of hefty. 

TASTE
The bowls tasted better than I expected. Would give both bowls 4/5 but I also asked for no kimchi or jalapeño (they let me pick replacements) so that made it better for me. Still not the best poke I've ever had, but way better than what I expected! 

ATMOSPHERE
The best part about Calii Love is definitely the restaurant itself. Everything here is cute AF! The staff were generally patient and nice which is a bonus. 

Definitely not my go-to poke spot but I would likely come back with friends maybe once in a long while."}
{"text":"Good smoothie bowl but soooo expensive. Yikes! My order of the Loved bowl and a decaf americano was almost $20. Unfortunately they also forgot my coffee - when I picked up the smoothie bowl I mentioned I was still waiting on a coffee, which the server then started making. Portion also was not that big considering the price, I was still a bit hungry after. Next time I will make a smoothie at home (or buy one from Starbucks for $5 if absolutely necessary). No more $12 smoothies for this gal!"}
{"text":"Newly opened at the concourse level of First Canadian Place near Longo's is this poke joint. Don't get discouraged with the line up because they have many staff on duty to accommodate the downtown lunch rush! The turnaround time is only around 5-10 minutes from lining up to pay to getting your poke bowl which is pretty decent to me. 

I ordered the small Hopeful bowl which had salmon sashimi, avocado, wakame, jalapeño, cherry tomatoes, black rice and spicy mayo sauce. They were able to make a note on my order to take out the pickled ginger which I didn't want in my bowl. The staff prepping my bowl later offered me the choice to choose another ingredient because I didn't want ginger, which was great! Then she asked for the amount of sauce you want in your bowl (low, medium, high), and condiments you want to add (seaweed, chili flakes, sesame...etc). And voila you are ready to go for either dining in or taking it to go! Note that the small bowl looks really small but is actually a decent size lunch because there's a lot of rice inside to fill you up. I would not have been able to finish a large.

Overall I had an awesome lunch. The service was great, food was good and healthy too. Price point is downtown lunch price. Some people complain about the price but I think it's reasonable given the location and quality. I will definitely be back very soon for more poke bowls and will want to try the smoothie bowls too!

Quick update - Do not order the Charcoal Latte, it does not taste pleasant at all!!"}
{"text":"The food is great. Especially in such a sunny day, I ordered a loved smoothie bowl and it was chill and sweet. (I always enjoy the sweet from the fruits.)
My friend ordered a pumped supersmoothie by mistake. She did not realize that was not a smoothie bowl. She was really frustrated and disliked the smoothie.
When I arrived there, it was the lunchtime in a weekday. So it was really busy and the service might need some improvement. I was not treated very friendly :-( 
Anyway, at least the taste of smoothie comforted me."}
{"text":"Ok my first review was 2* but I've upped it to 3.  The food I had Inspiration was tasty but man is it so not worth it.  After tax and an unnecessary tip my little lunch bowl of poke with no drink was $20.  Totally over priced in my opinion.  Also it comes with rice but the menu doesn't indicate that unfortunately.  Now that I read about the hepatitis warning about the location on Union I'm scared to go back...
Edit back to 2.."}
{"text":"Not too shabby! I stopped by Calii Love yesterday in Yorkville for lunch. It was decent! The set up is lovely and modern. There's lots of natural light. They had only a few vegan options, which was a bit surprising but the woman behind the counter explained that a lot of the menu items could be made vegan upon request. I had the 'adventurous' bowl with BBQ'd jackfruit. It was tasty and filling but for a 'bowl' I was expecting a quinoa or rice base instead of kind of a glorified salad. Mind you, it was a great salad - just not what I was expecting. I loved how when they call back the order they incorporate your name and the name of your order ie; \"Jenna's feeling adventurous!\" Very cute! And the condiment stand at the end of the counter was fantastic! Lots of options for customizations and additives like sesame seeds, chilli flakes, wasabi peas and shredded noori - yum! All in all, a pretty good place for an on the go lunch!"}
{"text":"I was drawn here by the Poké bowl hype. It was good, but nothing special.

I ordered the Hopeful bowl, which had a base of black rice, topped with salmon sashimi, jalapeños, guacamole. seaweed salad, pickled ginger, cherry tomatoes, and onions drizzled with some kind of mayo.

I liked the salmon sashimi and seaweed salad - texture of the sashimi was good and the seaweed salad was tasty but that's about it. Guacamole's not bad either. Personally I have a low spice tolerance and I'm not a fan of spicy food so I picked out the pickled ginger and jalapeños. The cherry tomatoes didn't really seem to fit in well with the rest of the toppings - I thought it was out of place (but then again, I'm not a fan of tomatoes in general so maybe I'm biased). The portion was a bit too big for me and I struggled to finish the rest of my rice - it seemed like the rice-topping ratio was off. My friend got the same thing as me and he had to bring home his leftovers because there was too much. 

However the atmosphere is welcoming and staff is exceptionally friendly. The space really does remind you of a cute beach café in California.

All in all, do I regret spending my $ here? No, but I don't think I would come back here again either.

Taste: 5/10
Atmosphere: 9/10
Service: 10/10"}
{"text":"Ordered:
Latte with Almond Milk (5/5)
Loved Smoothie Bowl (4/5) - Presentation is beautiful, price is too high.

Customer Service:
I was not greeted, but the person manning the order and cashier was talking to the person behind me. HELLO??? Do you not see me??? So, I quickly ordered my food 'cause that person was so. not. welcoming.

Ambiance/Decor:
Stunning! The #1 reason why I wanted to try out this place, very west-coast like, very chill.

If I am ever going to go back to Calii on a Sunday, I'm ordering through Ritual. Nobody got time to deal with people who hate working on a Sunday. :)"}
{"text":"Good vibes and warm atmosphere.  Staff was very accommodating and friendly. I was feeling \"adventurous \"(poke)  . Ingredients were fresh and flavourful. If you're really hungry get the larger portion. The smaller one was more of a light snack ."}
{"text":"love the food and the service! it is quite expensive but you are getting quality ingredients

my favourite is the calii love noodles they are gluten free and just amazing!! with a coconut milk matcha latte"}
{"text":"They get their protein from BULK BARN and have no idea what brand it is. Quality ingredients, I think not! They also skimp on the product, they only fill half the bowl up for acai bowls. Also once they put raw bananas as toppings...never again"}
{"text":"I have  been a fan of Poke since I went to Hawaii years ago. I tried it at several places last year while in LA and very excited it's now a thing in a Toronto. I've been trying several poke places around Toronto the last few weeks and Calii Love is hands down my favourite.
All Toronto poke so far have been good, but the reason why this is my favourite, it's because the quality is excellent, the atmosphere is happy and good vibes, and all three times I visited Calii Love, the customer service was excellent. I wish it was closer to where I live and work. 
If you want a pick me up during the cold winters, I would suggest Calii Love. It's got good California vibes and excellent quality food.
Hands down, the BEST poke joint in Toronto!
Calii Love, keep up the awesome work! 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I walked into this place was the strong hipster vibe which when paired with the ample seating space makes for a nice place to chill. While the place is known for its poke bowls I actually just came for a smoothie. I was recommended the clever smoothie as it was recommended to me by the staff. While the smoothie was good It was on the smaller side which considering this price tag of greater than $12 after taxes makes it very over priced. Overall I would say the smoothies here are not worth the hefty price tag. I can't comment on the food yet."}
{"text":"Cute little spot in the PATH - but not worth the price (even for a downtown takeout eatery). I bought a small bowl of chili that was priced out to almost $10. It was more of a side than a meal. Delicious - but not worth it. 
Heads up - they take plastic only. I went to pay with cash (hey, I kick it old school) and the friendly cashier let me know it's a cashless society up in the joint. 
I'll pass."}
{"text":"Hmm....I tried \"inspire\" at lunch and this is just a combination of cheap ingredients. Also they didn't mention in their menu that white rice is the base so I was expecting it comes with more stuffs rather than the poor amount of toppings that I can easily get from asian food marts."}
{"text":"Yes Sonia is feeling \"Good\" indeed. I came here for a smoothie and got hooked. When I say this place is wholesome, organic, sustainable, goodness I mean every bit of it.

From smoothies, to breakfast bowls, to their signature bowls they got everything healthy covered.

Yes it's pricey but you get what you pay for.
I love the way they announce your smoothie order...yes in front of everyone!

Love this place my fav smoothie is the Good and the Alive both have either coconut Milk or coconut yogurt in it.

Am indeed a regular for life here (-;"}
{"text":"So after a friend of mine had found a bug in her poke bowl from Poke Guys, I decided it was time to make a change in Poke-providers. I decided to try out Calii love with a friend that was in the mood for an acaii bowl, so this was a perfect place for the both of us. My friend ordered the loved acaii bowl, which, although was my first time trying an acaii bowl, I had no complaints. It was super refreshing, the perfect amount of filling, and a great start to the afternoon.

The poke bowl was a \"make your own\" bowl in a small size. I added a scoop of salmon and an egg to it, which was different than my usual order from Poke Guys, but I was extremely happy. The small size was just enough for me, and the salmon was very fresh. The toppings were perfect, although you could only add four (usually I've experienced 6 or 7 toppings included in the bowl).

The atmosphere of the restaurant was good - right on King street in a busy area, with the interior kept bright and clean, allowing the communal style seating to leave it quite relaxed. I'll probably order from here again if I'm ever walking past it, and if I'm desperate for Poke, I may try it out on ubereats."}
{"text":"Really great food but the service is slow. Employees are slowly making the food while talking and joking around. A smoothie can take up to 20 minutes which can be frustrating. Overall, I will always go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious California style organic and gluten free options. Drink the organic root beer and Yerba mate with a veggie or sashimi bowl mmmmmm"}
{"text":"From the popularity of sushi burritos during the summer, to the proliferation of poké bars around the city in the fall, 2016 has been a fishy one for Toronto foodies (see what I did there?).

Enter Calii Love, the newest poké stop in the city's King West district, promoting Californian style with a Hawaiian twist. Given that I'm convinced I was Californian in a previous life, the name alone had me reeled in (yes, I could do this all night, folks).

The bright, airy space, with its tropical motif and contemporary decor, emits a feel good, West Coast vibe. The emphasis is on organic, sustainable, vegan and gluten-free options. Grab-and-go, or take a seat and get to know your fellow diners at the communal table.

As I peruse the menu and approach the counter, I'm consumed by the burst of colourful and fresh ingredients and stealth-like preparation of smoothies and poké bowls. Pronounced \"poh-keh\", this Hawaiian salad with seasoned raw fish has gained a cult-like status with health-conscious diners, popping up in chic neighbourhoods all over California...and now Toronto.

Each menu item is titled to reflect a feeling - Proud, Awakened, Confident, Grateful and so on - and today I'm feeling Happy and Adventurous - a notion that appeases both, my mental state of mind and my appetite.

The Happy superfood smoothie is a beautiful blend of banana, raw cocoa, coconut milk, strawberry, dark chocolate and raw cocoa nibs...and that's plenty reason to be happy. It's a little bit chunky for my taste, but delicious in every form.

I pair my drink with an Adventurous poké bowl stacked with salmon, furikake, kimchee, sriracha, wasabi aioli, jalapenos, cucumber and white rice. This one packs in a spicy punch and I'm immediately happy with the countering effects of my cool smoothie (last pun, I promise).

Calii Love received a lot of love during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) with several A-list celebrities making a pit stop, including Joseph Gordon Levitt, Dakota Fanning, Jason Sudeikis, Anne Hathaway, Jane Lynch, Natalie Portman, and Gerard Butler, to name a few. Chef Joe Friday has worked in some of Hawaii's finest kitchens, including Nobu Waikiki, and was eager to bring that authentic poké experience to Toronto. Our city thanks you, sir.

The spot opens 7am daily, which is great news for those early downtown risers looking to grab a healthy acai bowl, smoothie or direct trade coffee before heading to work. Poké bowls are only available after 11am.

And if you're lucky, the country's top-rated latte artist, Barista Brian Leonard may even be around to truly personalise your coffee ... with some latte art of your face. Like we needed any more reason to feel good."}
{"text":"went here after shopping at MEC and i was pleased with the friendliness and speedy service of the staff. the place has plenty of seats and as far as i can tell, they also have an upper floor for additional seatings. thisbplace has multiple instagram worthy shots so you can eat and 'gram at the same time

they also offer smoothies, coffees/lattes/tea, and bakery ontop of the regular poke/sushi items. i decided to make my own (regular) poke bowl with 2 spoons of protein (salmon and tuna). it was honestly delicious - they were not stingy with their toppings and were very accomodating to my needs. My poke bowl was amazing and it definitely filled me up - everything was fresh!"}
{"text":"Would recommend skipping this place.  Just had the cali love and the chicken was mostly dark meat and not fully cooked.  The tea bag spilled so the tea leaves were all in the tea. (I had delivered so perhaps this is not fully their fault trying to be fair)

But serving not fully cooked chicken gives them a negative star I had to throw the meal out....."}
{"text":"The smoothie bowls here are delicious!!! So fresh and presented nicely. The atmosphere is nice but can get really loud, and the projector is a bit annoying if you end up sitting near it, it'll be flashing in your face the whole time. It also took a really long time just to get a smoothie bowl however it's very delicious and worth visiting to try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Had victory bowl as it was recommended by the cash staff. Not very good best way to describe it: 3 large spoons of white rice, avocado puree, untasty not fresh made salsa, a few unintersti g tortilla chips, a few small pieces of chicken. $16 w/ tax."}
{"text":"I went in with a great attitude but a slight hesitation... because I was born in Hawaii and Caucasians have milked the beauty of Pokè and turned it into a fast-food craze lacking the astonishing knife work, high-quality fish, and love that goes into authentic Hawaiian cuisine. That being said I popped in on a whim. And I have no regrets. 

AMBIANCE: It's in a great walkable area. Steps away from, street cars, health food stores, a Starbucks, bus stops and a LBCO and few other locally owned markets and restaurants. Right next to a plethora of condos and apartments. The dwellers of this area have an air about them that read health-conscious young professionals... making this restaurant the perfect location. There are large tables, outside seating, free WiFi, and a chill coffeehouse vibe combined with it all. 

When I first entered there was 1 person at the register, 4 people ahead of me and took approximately 8-10 mins to have the opportunity to order. I was then dryly greeted by a dark haired young man that seemed to be new and unaware of everything. He literally asked me how I wanted my shot of espresso prepared??? Walked away in the middle of me paying to asks senior employees questions and never came back. There was a black girl there that seemed to know the most, be the friendliest and orchestrated this whole slowly moving car crash. Also 15 mins passed and I realized they forgot my order I approached the pick-up line and the HBIC swiftly corrected the error, apologized and professionally changed the subject on to my future weekend plans.

NOTES: They don't have Paleo or Grain-free protein. They recently became cashless so only credit, debit or Apple Pay. For anyone that is paleo-friendly, gluten-free I suggest getting the building your own salad, and asking for certain items removed from the smoothies. 

FOOD ORDER: I ordered the Great smoothie, without plant protein and added almond butter and almond milk, I ordered a shot of espresso and simple diced poke salmon with sweet potato and cabbage salad. We enjoyed them all accept the poke. This place is good but it's more than the food... its the ambiance that is winning. To be honest the food is average but I love how they have honestly captured Caucasians view of what they think Hawaii is truly like ."}
{"text":"Honestly, design trumps taste/value in other words their marketing is much better than the food itself.  The food itself was good, decent but did not blow my mind or even made me think:  I need to go back.

I ordered the \"Amazing\" on Ritual which is a poke now consisting of: 
Atlantic salmon, smashed avocado, pickled ginger, raw beet, jalapeño, green onion, and fermented sriracha mayo on black rice.  I definitely did not feel 'amazing' and instead hungrier.  The Eats Week promotion is a great deal by the size is fairly small.

The ambiance is very chaotic as there are so many people there for either coffee or lunch/food.  There is a lot of seating which quickly fills up but turn around of people seated can be quick with half eating and going whilst the other half chatted away. It is definitely a very 'instagrammable' spot if you can manage to find space to take that shot"}
{"text":"The line was long but the food was not worth the wait. I ordered the Excited bowl and it was tiny and tasted bland. I could barely find the salmon in there. The Immortal smoothie was bitter and dry but I finished it anyway because the Excited bowl was insanely spicy. The spiciness made me feel sick after the meal and the next day."}
{"text":"The good thing about this place is that it's spacious. Been here 3 times now and have tried their coffee, acai bowl and their poke bowl. Their cappuccino could use a bit of work... I think 2/3 of the cup was coffee with the remainder being all foam - needless to say I was not impressed. Also got a regular brewed coffee on a separate occasion and there was quite a bit of coffee grounds at the bottom - I've never really had an issue with this at other coffee shops, so that was also disappointing.

I'ved tried the acai bowl - another reviewer mentioned that there were chunks of unblended acai, which wasn't the case for me. I actually thought that it was slightly overblended if anything. They ran out of granola when I ordered, so the bowl was definitely lacking the texture that I would've liked - obviously not something that can be controlled much.

Their poke bowl is decent - not the best in the city but will do the job. If you're really hungry, the small will not be enough."}
{"text":"The space is wide , clean, pretty and has a large middle table. Looks promising, and so is the menu. 

The thing is, it's not bad, but nothing \"wow\" either. The big downside is that for a small bowl of salad with salmon I paid way too much and was still hungry after. And, the \"Zucchini and Sweet potato noodles\" are not noodles, they are shredded raw veggies, I'm not sure it qualifies as noodles

So all in all, it's not bad, but definitely not worth the price and I won't be back."}
{"text":"The Bay Street location needs to get their $h!t together. The guy entering my large lunch order gave off a \"Cali vibe\" in that he seemed super high...\"on life\". So much so, that the order was wrong - he forgot someone's order (which I was still charged for), didn't substitute other items. Basically I was in a lunch meeting with a hungry person and several other annoyed who asked where TF I ordered from?!

The Bay street location doesn't even have a telephone, I called King to see if the other location took AMEX, which garnered a head scratch. The order online option didn't work on the website. I called King location again once I got back and realized the item I was charged for was missing and was told they would call me back. Haven't heard back. Won't be going back. 

The whole \"bowl\" trend is a rip off. Filler ingredients like rice and onions with a smattering of avocado and tuna and I'm paying $16? Pass on all fronts with this place."}
{"text":"Was super excited to see a fresh option for a quick snack. Ordered the Hopeful smoothie and upon leaving I realized that I really should return and give them a Vitamix lesson. The ingredients while tasty were shredded and inedible and kept getting stuck in my throat. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"It was pretty good when the place first opened, but quality of food has gotten down. Both my friend and I have gotten rice that tasted like pebbles - probably leftover rice from 1 or 2 days ago."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while after the gym. They have a good selection of bowls. It does take them a bit of time to prepare but the food is always fresh and the bowls always taste amazing. Not as big a fan of the smoothies as I like mine thick and they are more liquid like, but that seems to be the trend for a lot of places these days."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Union Station location, and got the 'Alive' smoothie & picked up the 'Warm' breakfast bowl (filling!) They have espresso, tea, and a bunch of on-the-go food & snacks that are perfect for a place like Union. Best oatmeal that I've had outside of my kitchen"}
{"text":"Really like this place, I have been there hundred times and never disappointed! Healthy food for a reasonable price=) just go for it!"}
{"text":"First of all these cats need to go to Cali first not just put up a pop up as seen on TV Venice beach special.  Super slow service small smoothies I mean that's pretty much it. Like I said you want to be cali go to cali and see how people eat \"raw\" and their customer service."}
{"text":"Walked by and was in the mood for some poke bowls so we decided to stop and try it out. 

Right when you walk in, you feel like you've entered a modern day surf shack. They had long wooden tables with magazines spread out over the counter to keep you entertained. The decor goes for a more hipster vibe that makes you feel as if you're not in the heart of Toronto during a snow storm. 

While waiting in line to order, I noticed that there really wasn't a line and staff and customers alike were quite flustered. It wasn't a busy time of night either. The restaurant's layout causes traffic not only with Calii Love's customers, but with the upstairs studio as well when classes are let out (I believe it's a fitness/yoga studio). 

After ordering and waiting for my two pokes bowls, I noticed that the small Hopeful Poke bowl I ordered didn't even full up half the bowl. The rice was only 1/4 full with a table spoon of each topping. For 13$, I was unimpressed; The bowl was half empty when I received it! When I asked about it, they replied with \"This is what you ordered, sorry.\" I understand that with that particular bowl, those are the toppings we get. But to give a customer a half empty bowl when they ordered a (should have been) full bowl left pretty big question marks. 

The hopeful bowl was a normal small portion. It came with much more toppings and the flavours blended well together. 

This is just my experience and hopefully, others have had/will have better luck. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try as part of promotion on Ritual app.  Ordered the Amazing poke bowl which has salmon, avocado, beets, ginger, jalapeño, green onion, sriracha mayo on bed of black rice.  

Got back to office full of anticipation to eat.  Then the disappointment set in after the first few bites.  The ingredients within the bowl are poorly balanced in terms of taste.  It tasted very bland and salmon provided was in very small portion.  At the regular price point of $11.95 + tax per bowl, it is definitely not worth your money.  

Overall, avoid this bowl.  This might have become the worst poke bowl I have ever tasted.  No joke.  It is anything BUT amazing.  I might return to try other offerings like their smoothies."}
{"text":"I came back for a second try, and I was really happy with the service that I got. 

It was so much better going during off peak hours (Sunday night), because you don't have to wait in line, and the server was pleasantly helpful and knowledgeable about the food they're serving. Their poke was amazingly fresh and I got a way better value out of it than the first.

I think it's a decent poke place, but yeah the value may have to be adjusted a bit on their app, otherwise I would avoid the rush hours here."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience was just the worst. And the worst part was was that I was headed towards Pita Pit, a reliable go to, but decided to spontaneously try Calii Love. Never again. I wish I listened to my friends that told me not to bother with it.


I ordered a poke bowl in the small size and asked for kale instead of rice. First mistake. The kale made it look like nothing. Then I got an ice cream scoop of tuna (not very much) an ice cream scoop of some soggy seaweed salad, raw onions, and two sauces. When the girl closed the takeout container the only words I could form were \"that's it?!?!\" The bowl wasn't even full. She told me how the bowl I ordered was the simplest one. Clearly. 13 dollars for that is a joke. I'm a regular at Pokito and for 13 dollars over there I'd get a hell of a lot more.

The staff were also pretty slow considering how quiet it was. While I was waiting as they were talking about the stuff that had been sitting there all day and what they're running out of and whatnot. Sorry but I don't care to hear that!!

They really need to get their act together and stop ripping people off. I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Cashier was not so friendly and the food took awhile (expected when ordering freshly made food), but the vibe, energy and decor was so Socal, welcoming and inspirational. Don't forget to take a picture in front of their Cali Wings on the side of the building."}
{"text":"I love very close to Calii Love so I've been a few times. Not gonna lie, I'll likely return because it's convenient and quick. Poke bowls are mediocre and expensive. A large is $15 and it's 80% rice. Smoothie bowls are ok (also expensive) and the amount of fruit you get depends on who's making it. The space is very insta-friendly though!"}
