{"text":"Must be the tourist station. A lot of inconsiderate people. But, it is a good one. Just try to go when its not so busy"}
{"text":"Easy access, always busy but never have a problem getting a pump. Really close to food and the rental car return for the airport. Only thing I don't like is having to go inside to get my gas receipt."}
{"text":"$3.69 for gas yes of course I need it, well I just drove from Los Angeles area and just arrived to Las Vegas. First stop was the outlets and the second stop was this Chevron gas station.

A lot of people were getting gas but it still went by quickly and I really don't have any complaints about this place. 

Just remember to pump your gas in Vegas before you start your long drive back home. You don't want to be in the middle of the dessert with no gas...that is just not good."}
{"text":"Great Chevron location. My car is very picky and if the octan precentage is incorrect it'll drive bad, put gas on this location you'll keep your car in great shape. Price is good as well compair other gas stations. Recommended"}
{"text":"Gas is always high at this spot since it's right near the airport and on the strip but it's outrageously convenient - hence the name. So I make it work. But you will pay more here for sure"}
{"text":"Typical Chevron Gas Station. 

Gotta love the super cheap gas prices in vegas...im talking like SUPER DUPER CHEAP GAS PRICES. 

Its a tradition for me to fill at this station because I refuse to fill my car up with those random/unheard named gas stations/companies.

My first stop in vegas is Lees Liqours....this is my 2nd.

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^"}
