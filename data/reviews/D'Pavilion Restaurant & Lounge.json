{"text":"The food here is really good if you're looking for that West Indian Flavour! Curry chicken roti and jerk chicken chow mein are a must try, not to mention the most popular pepper shrimp that's on their menu. If you're looking to have a drink the beer is pretty cheap here. I definitely recommend that it's a must try :)"}
{"text":"Great service, beautiful patio, and yummy pholourie. Try the large pepper shrimp and carribean run punch. Brought my mom out!"}
{"text":"I ate at this place last year and food was very good. Ate there recently and food was awful. Curry king fish dhal and rice. The king fish was inedible - over-cooked, dry and hard. this was a huge disappointment.
the server was very pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"I passed by this place on Friday and it looked like a happening Caribbean dance..I will be back to try it.In the meantime, the pepper shrimp is good.
..So I've been back to try it a couple times now. It's a solid place, gets started not too late past midnight..and good crowd of ppl that come to actually dance."}
