{"text":"Stick with take-out. Pizza is great but service is painfully slow. Best to have delivered and avoid turning a 30 minute meal into a 2 hour ordeal."}
{"text":"Good food and has a freindly staff, however I don't like that it is a non smoke free place. It has a smoke free dining room upstairs but the atmosphere is downstairs which is not"}
{"text":"Great pizza and my co-worker enjoyed the lasagna. When I travel to Moon Pizza Roma is on my list of places worth eating."}
{"text":"Perfect for what it is. A good pub with good pub fare. Bomb fries. Good specials. Nice bartender and tasty brew."}
{"text":"The restaurant is upstairs and the bar is on the main level, so that turned me off from checking this place out.. But eventually I did stop in with some friends and we were pleasantly surprised by the relaxed atmosphere upstairs. There is a large wall mural of a city street in Italy, which was cool to look at. 
We had the white pizza and traditional and the white was the best I've ever had! You have to try it-- it won't disappoint!
Service could've been better-- the high-school age server was sitting at a nearby booth by herself on her phone for quite some time. Who does that? Anyway, it's worth checking this place out because their white pizza is da bomb."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! This is one of those places I go to when I am home because I remember how good the pizza is and it did not disappoint. I went for dinner on Christmas Eve (thank goodness they were open!) and ate upstairs with my sweetie. We ordered pizza and wings and the pizza was good but the wings weren't fried hard enough so they were a little soft. Service kind of sucks upstairs...maybe because it was Christmas Eve but they were not trying to provide any kind of decent service. Can't go wrong with the pepperoni pizza here. I've been here countless times and I'll be back as long as the pizza is still good."}
{"text":"Pizza is better than average; huge slices for a great price. Dining in is ill advised. Bar is smoker friendly and difficult to experience if you are not a smoker. So order a large pepperoni and pick it up."}
{"text":"A fun place whose clientele keeps it real. The juke biz is loud an varied by regulars so don't skip songs too much! 

Expert tip - come on Saturday night for Yinzer night for IC Light, Yuengling, and Rolling Rock specials."}
{"text":"Way too long to get waited on! Food cold! Young waiter Maurice forgot half the things we asked for when we first joked, write this down. Did I mention we were the only ones here! Well, 2 families done and just hanging out. He brought wedding soup when we ordered mushroom! Will never go back."}
{"text":"Was going to eat in the restaurant part upstairs, but there were a bunch of kids running around (apparently parents don't like to discipline their kids) so we opted to dine in the bar area.  The bar area definitely needs a make over.  Probably hasn't been painted in years.  They actually had boxes sitting on the floor that the Halloween decorations are stored in.  Guess they've been there all month?  Doesn't the owner notice something like that???

Now the food. Two wedding soups served luke warm. Turkey, bacon, swiss on toasted Italian bread was very good.  Small portion of the lasagna is still a good size portion.  Not bad, but was kind of sitting in a pool of runny sauce."}
{"text":"When you come into the restaurant on the first floor it smells like cigarettes since target have a bar that you can smoke in. But the second floor is a lot better. We took a seat, and a waitress came over, we ordered right away, we got mozzarella sticks, and a bunch of other food. Staff is ok. Bathrooms are disgusting."}
{"text":"For take out and delivery this is the best pizza option in Sewickley. I don't ever go to eat-in so this review should take that into account. 

The downstairs is a smokey bar, the upstairs is a sit down restaurant. Competitively priced good quality pizza. The white pizza is especially good."}
{"text":"When some friends we hadn't seen in a long time let us know they were going to be in town and wanted to meet we were all excited. They said they would be at Roma in Sewickley and, fools that we are, thought it was gonna be a Pizza Roma.  But no! Not related! We showed up and walked into a smoke filled bar with a dense haze of thick, nasty, choking level of cigarette smoke. Not a good first impression. We got to visit with our friends and catch up on old times. I wanted beer (duh!!) but the draft selection was pitiful. Who drinks that stuff?? Yuck!! There was a decent selection of bottled beer which was in a standup, serve yourself cooler. Grab a beer, go to the bar, show the bartender what you had and pay for it. That's odd.

Our friends wanted to eat so they ordered pizza. It came and I was appalled. It looked like the worst high school cafeteria pizza you ever had. Picture a triple thick Wonder bread base covered in ketchup with some partially melted string cheese on top. Make you hungry? Me either. We declined. Even without the dense smoke I wouldn't have taken a bite. Maybe the smoke is there to confuse your tastes buds!!  The thin crust version which we also saw looked inedible too. 
 
Smoke filled room. Nasty food. Poor draft selection. Not a great atmosphere in general. Nah. Not for me. I reserve my 1 star ratings for places I'll never go back to. This place meets that criteria."}
{"text":"Pizza Roma is a beacon of light for those seeking a dive bar experience in the heart of Sewickley Village. You are allowed to smoke in the bar, so be prepared to smell like an ash tray the next morning. The bartenders are always friendly, and top shelf liquor is half the price that other bars in Sewickley charge."}
{"text":"Was a lil Leary to come here because of other reviews but I saw they had a buffet for $8 who could beat that! The buffet is not much to look at but the food and taste is amazing! Sarah is a total sweet heart and hustles her but off while maintaining a great attitude"}
{"text":"I had the lasagna, my Sweetie had spaghetti with meat balls. The food was slow coming but worth the wait. Service was excellent!
We will be back."}
{"text":"Just your typical Friday night pizza joint. We were in on a busy Friday night and had a pretty good experience. The only disappointment was that our apps came out with out pizza. The waitress apologized and blamed the cook. That didn't solve the issue but it wasn't a big deal. The inside needs a total renovation, it's very outdated and still has carpet on the floor in the upstairs dining area."}
{"text":"This was, literally, LIT-ERALLY the worst dining experience I have ever had in my 28 years on this earth. I'm a patient person (check my other yelps if u don't believe me bro). We went here at like .. 6:20 Sunday night. Had somewhere important to be at 7:30 (it was two streets over so we gave ourselves plenty of time). There was a huge party going on in the upstairs dining room, but we figured it would be ok. Sat down, ordered, got our salads quickly, and waited for our food. 45 MINUTES LATER. FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER. After I had my boyfriend ask the waitress to box it up and bring the check because we were gonna be late for our meeting. Finally she brought it. (Two hoagies by the way- not that difficult to throw together). COMPLETE WRONG ORDER. Wrong sandwich, had the stuff on it I asked not to put on it. You know I don't ask for much in this cruel world, but a damn steak hoagie. She comped it after I gave her attitude (I apologized, chill out yelp). But like for real. They could've told us it might take awhile for our food when we got there. Unapologetic and rude staff. NEVER AGAIN ROMA. NEVER AGAIN. 


Oh by the way, 9/10 on the ranch scale tho"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the most dysfunctional and worst restaurant in Sewickley.  I've tried to eat here a few times and only once was I even waited on.  Today was the last straw as I walked in with my family and sat upstairs in the dining room for 20 minutes all alone with no one once coming up to ask us what we want.  The employees were all downstairs in the cancer room smoking and watching TV.  This place needs to close so a functional restaurant can take its place.

From my previous visit to this place the food is pretty bad.  It's always lukewarm and hastily prepared."}
